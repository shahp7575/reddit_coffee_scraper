I have done dozens of 24 hour fasts, about ten 48 hour fasts, and four 72+ hour fasts. I feel I am ready to try and fast for a few weeks (20ish days). All I will consume each day is water and plain black coffee, and will supplement with electrolyte powder, pink himalaya salt, and a daily multivitamin. When I'm ready to break my fast I will refeed with bone broth for 10 days and then slowly start reincorporating keto foods (i.e. steak and asparagus cooked in butter).

In this time I will also be working out for an hour 3-5 times a week and will drink plenty of water.

Is there anything I'm missing here to prevent adverse health effects? I have plenty of fat to burn so I dont think I'm at risk of lean mass deterioration.

Also, what mulitvitamin (or vitamins) should I use? My electrolyte powder has calcium, magnesium, zinc, manganese, sodium, and potassium.

Thanks in advance for the help, I feel like my plan is 95% ready to execute.",1,1741550262.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

**Understanding Java Burn: The Concept and Claims**  
  
Java Burn is designed to be mixed with coffee, leveraging the natural compounds in coffee to enhance its weight loss potential. The product's marketing emphasizes a ""7-second coffee loophole,"" suggesting that adding Java Burn to your daily coffee routine can trigger a ""fat-melting mode"" without the need for drastic lifestyle changes.  
  
**Key Ingredients and Their Potential Benefits**  
  
A closer examination of Java Burn's ingredient list reveals a blend of components commonly associated with weight management:  
  


* **Green Tea Extract (300 mg):** Rich in catechins, green tea extract is known for its antioxidant properties and potential to enhance fat oxidation. Some studies suggest it can boost metabolic rate, aiding in weight loss efforts.
* **Green Coffee Bean Extract (200 mg):** Containing chlorogenic acid, this extract may help regulate blood sugar levels and reduce carbohydrate absorption, contributing to weight management.
* **L-Carnitine (100 mg):** An amino acid that plays a role in fat metabolism by transporting fatty acids into the mitochondria for energy production. However, evidence supporting its effectiveness for weight loss is mixed.
* **L-Theanine (100 mg):** Found in tea leaves, L-Theanine promotes relaxation without drowsiness and may counteract the jittery effects of caffeine, providing a balanced energy boost.
* **Chromium (20 mcg):** This trace mineral is involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and may help regulate blood sugar levels, potentially reducing sugar cravings.
* **Vitamins B6 (1 mg) and B12 (5 mcg):** These vitamins are essential for energy production and overall metabolic function. While they support general health, their direct impact on weight loss is not well-established.

**Assessing the Effectiveness: Scientific Perspective**  
  
While the individual ingredients in Java Burn have been studied for their potential health benefits, it's crucial to consider the dosages and the synergistic effect of the blend:  
  


* **Dosage Concerns:** Some experts argue that the amounts of certain ingredients in Java Burn may be lower than the effective doses observed in clinical studies. For instance, the L-Carnitine and L-Theanine content might not be sufficient to produce significant effects.
* **Synergistic Effects:** The combination of these ingredients with coffee's natural compounds could potentially enhance their efficacy. However, comprehensive clinical trials on Java Burn's specific formulation are lacking, making it challenging to draw definitive conclusions about its effectiveness.

**User Experiences: A Mixed Bag**  
  
User feedback on Java Burn varies, reflecting a range of experiences:  
  


* **Positive Reviews:** Many users report increased energy levels, improved focus, and gradual weight loss when incorporating Java Burn into their daily routines. The convenience of adding it to coffee is frequently highlighted as a significant advantage.
* **Negative Reviews:** Some users express disappointment due to a lack of noticeable results. There are also concerns about potential side effects, such as digestive discomfort or increased heart rate, particularly among individuals sensitive to caffeine.

**Safety and Side Effects**  
  
Java Burn is formulated with natural ingredients and is free from artificial additives, which generally suggests a favorable safety profile. However, potential users should consider the following:  
  


* **Caffeine Interaction:** Combining Java Burn with coffee increases overall caffeine intake, which may lead to side effects like jitteriness, insomnia, or elevated heart rate in sensitive individuals.
* **Allergic Reactions:** Although rare, some individuals might experience allergic reactions to specific components in the supplement. It's advisable to review the ingredient list carefully and consult a healthcare provider if you have known allergies.
* **Medical Conditions:** Individuals with underlying health conditions or those taking medications should consult a healthcare professional before using Java Burn to avoid potential interactions.

**Pricing and Availability**  
  
Java Burn is exclusively available through its official website, with pricing structured to encourage bulk purchases:  
  


* **One Pouch:** $69
* **Three Pouches:** $117 ($39 per pouch)
* **Six Pouches:** $204 ($34 per pouch)

The company offers a 60-day money-back guarantee, allowing customers to try the product risk-free. This policy reflects confidence in the product and provides reassurance to skeptical buyers.  
  
**Final Verdict: Is Java Burn Worth It in 2025?**  
  
Java Burn presents an innovative approach to weight management by integrating a supplement into a daily coffee routine. Its blend of natural ingredients, coupled with positive user testimonials, suggests potential benefits such as enhanced energy and modest weight loss. However, the lack of robust clinical trials on the product as a whole and concerns about ingredient dosages warrant a cautious approach.

About 10 days ago I started getting cold symptoms, and then 4 days ago I was super congested, exhausted, had a temperature of between 38.5C and 39.5C and full body chills. Today the temperature has come down slightly (still hovering around 38C) and I have less pain in my face and head, I am still congested but it feels like I’m coming towards the end of whatever this is. I did phone the doctor after 3 days of the high fever because I was just feeling so awful, and she told me to wait it out and try a decongestant steroid nose spray (beconase) so I did that. Tried to get rest but I’m a working mum to a toddler and moving house this Wednesday so… not ideal timing for resting! 

It’s not abnormal for me to get bad viral infections because I have asthma and I always seem to develop secondary infections from colds. The thing that is different this time though is that as of yesterday I have had NO sense of smell or taste. And I really mean none. I can’t smell anything, not even strong essential oils, and I can’t taste anything at all - my coffee tastes like hot water and I can’t even taste the salt on something like a crisp. I’m unsure whether I have had covid as I don’t have any tests. 

Is it normal to lose all sense of smell and taste following a viral infection? Is there anything I can do to help get it back? Does anyone know how long this is likely to last?

I am waiting on biopsy but the Gastroenterologist said she believes it’s reflux hypersensitivity. I just don’t understand how it can be that when what I feel is on my left abdomen and stomach. I also had ultrasound of my gallbladder and bloodwork to check for pancreatitis and everything came back normal. I just hate throwing meds at something that doesn’t make sense to me. Do these symptoms sound similar to anyone else with reflux hypersensitivity? I can’t eat anything red sauce or red vegetables or coffee for fear of the pain.,2,1741549075.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I’m not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I’m not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/ogCNVId)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

I work at a coffee shop in a small airport and we are the only restaurant in the airport, so it’s pretty high volume with breaks between flights.

I usually am the one working afternoons (there’s only one barista per shift). However, the loophole to that is that if the last flight gets delayed, we have to wait and stay open. 

Recently, my boss wanted the baristas to also deliver pastries which adds about 45 minutes to my shift daily so now I’m at about a nine hour shift solo on good days. 

Today I check the flight schedule and the last flight leaves at 9:30. I ask my boss if I have to stay for that and she says yes. So now my shift today is 12 hours. I just hope this 9:30 flight isn’t a regular thing bc I am going to be Exhausted. ",2,1741548766.0,barista,5,1.0,False

1j7fhl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Top_Bluebird2229/comments/1j7fhl3/possible_correlation_between_bfs_and_low_nitric/,Possible correlation between BFS and low Nitric oxide levels,"Hey guys fellow twitcher here, been going for about 4 months now started off bilaterally in my legs after some really bad tightness in my hamstrings, some bad health anxiety, poor lifestyle etc. Ive never been an anxious person prior but I do work a stressful job. A quick background I’m a full time paramedic in one of if not the busiest stations in the state, so id like to think there is some element of chronic stress sprinkled in. Anywho, I’ve noticed something quite interesting while scouring the forums and doing my own research about this condition and other neurological conditions ( yes i went down that rabbit hole you know what I’m talking about ).  Ive come to find that low Nitric oxide correlates to the  majority of symptoms that most of us have been facing with some links to long covid as-well. Now I am no doctor or anything and this is just something I noticed that lines up with what most of us are facing, but i would like to get your inputs and thoughts about it as-well.

So to start off there are 3 main types of NO in the body:

1. Neuronal Nitric Oxide (nNOS) – Nervous System & Muscle Function
	
Produced by: Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS, NOS1)

Location: Brain, spinal cord, skeletal muscles

Function:
Regulates neurotransmission (nerve signaling)
Supports muscle function and coordination
Helps in learning, memory, and mood regulation
Modulates pain perception

Deficiency Effects:
Muscle weakness, cramps, and fasciculations (BFS-like symptoms)
Cognitive issues (brain fog, memory problems)
Anxiety and depression


2. Endothelial Nitric Oxide (eNOS) – Blood Flow & Heart Health

Produced by: Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS, NOS3)

Location: Blood vessel walls (endothelium), heart

Function:
Vasodilation (relaxes blood vessels, lowers blood pressure)
Improves oxygen and nutrient delivery to tissues
Prevents blood clotting and artery damage
Protects the heart and brain from stroke & cardiovascular disease

Deficiency Effects:
Poor circulation (cold hands/feet, muscle pain, exercise intolerance)
High blood pressure, increased risk of stroke & heart disease
Fatigue due to reduced oxygen delivery


3.Inducible Nitric Oxide (iNOS) – Immune Response & Inflammation

Produced by: Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS, NOS2)

Location: White blood cells (macrophages), inflammatory cells

Function:
Fights bacteria, viruses, and pathogens
Promotes inflammation during infections
Helps in wound healing


Excessive iNOS Activation (Toxic Effects):
Creates peroxynitrite (ONOO⁻), a harmful oxidant
Leads to neuroinflammation & nerve damage (seen in Long COVID, neurodegenerative diseases)
Worsens chronic pain, autoimmune conditions, and fatigue

Here is some further elaboration in related to conditions;

Low NO (nNOS and eNOS) in BFS:

NO’s Role in Nerve Function: Nitric oxide, especially produced by nNOS (neuronal NOS), plays a crucial role in neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and neuroprotection. Low NO levels can impair neurotransmission and contribute to muscle weakness, cramping, and poor circulation, all of which are common symptoms in BFS.

Neurological Impact: Low NO can lead to impaired blood flow to the brain and muscles, making it harder for the nervous system to function optimally. This may contribute to muscle spasms, twitching, and fatigue, which are hallmark symptoms of BFS.

Pathology: In BFS, a deficiency in NO production could result in poor neurological function, muscle dysfunction, and potentially neuroinflammation, which exacerbates BFS symptoms.

Low NO  (nNOS and eNOS) in Long COVID:

Endothelial Dysfunction: COVID-19 can impair eNOS (endothelial NOS), leading to reduced NO production in the endothelial cells of blood vessels. This causes poor circulation, fatigue, and muscle weakness—common symptoms of Long COVID.

Vascular Inflammation: Persistent inflammation in Long COVID can reduce NO production and contribute to vascular dysfunction, resulting in poor oxygen delivery to tissues and contributing to symptoms like shortness of breath, brain fog, and exercise intolerance.

Neuroinflammation: In Long COVID, increased inflammation can lead to decreased neuronal NO, worsening cognitive symptoms (like brain fog, concentration difficulties, and memory issues) and contributing to muscle weakness and fatigue.


Pathology of iNOS and Peroxynitrite in BFS and Long covid 


iNOS is an enzyme that produces large amounts of nitric oxide (NO) during inflammation. Unlike endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which produces beneficial NO for blood flow and relaxation, iNOS is upregulated in response to chronic infection, inflammation, and oxidative stress.

In both Benign Fasciculation Syndrome (BFS) and Long COVID, iNOS overactivation leads to excessive nitric oxide production, which can cause:
Neuroinflammation – Overstimulated immune cells (microglia) release inflammatory cytokines that irritate motor neurons.
Excitotoxicity – Excess NO interacts with glutamate pathways, overstimulating motor neurons and causing twitching.
Mitochondrial Dysfunction – High iNOS activity leads to cellular energy deficits, resulting in fatigue, muscle weakness, and nerve dysfunction.


Other symptoms of Low NO:

Random muscle or joint pain (sharp, aching, or burning)
Stiffness and soreness after activity
Muscle cramps or twitches (BFS-related)
Nerve pain (tingling, burning, or sensitivity)
Headaches or migraines
Air hunger” or breathlessness despite normal oxygen levels
Slow reaction time & brain processing lag
Anxiety that feels physical (tight chest, racing heart)
Sensory processing issues (light, sound, and touch sensitivity)
Difficulty regulating emotions (mood swings, overreacting to stress)
Random nerve “buzzing” or electrical zaps
Ears feeling “full” or mild hearing loss without infection
Unstable blood sugar without diabetes
Morning stiffness & difficulty getting moving
Heavy” legs during exercise
Sudden blood pressure spikes
Feet turning red or blotchy when standing
Pale skin or dark under-eye circles even when well-rested
Numbness or tingling that moves around
Inability to sweat properly (too much or too little sweat)


Symptoms of High iNOS & Peroxynitrite Toxicity

Glutamate overload” symptoms (brain fog, wired but tired, sudden irritability)
Sudden sensitivity to caffeine or stimulants
Restless leg syndrome (RLS) that worsens at night
Episodes of “surging energy” followed by extreme fatigue
Random muscle “burning” sensations without exercise
Odd internal vibrations or shaky feeling (but no visible tremor)
Worsening of neurological symptoms after a high-nitrate meal or exercise
Sudden increase in food sensitivities & histamine intolerance
Sharp, migratory joint pain (moves around randomly)
New onset of autoimmune symptoms without a diagnosis
Teeth sensitivity & gum inflammation without cavities
Worsening of symptoms in bright light or fluorescent lighting
Sudden worsening of symptoms with antioxidant deficiency (low vitamin C, glutathione, or NAC)
Waking up at 2–4 AM with a racing heart

All these symptoms to my knowledge have been mentioned in these forums and i found it so interesting how it almost explains everything. Ive found by addressing and supplementing to support nNOS and eNOS production has dramatically reduced my symptoms which initially where;

Severe anxiety (now corrected)
Frequent migraines (havent had one in four months which is amazing considering my migraines where so frequent and last me a week at times)
Light sensitivity (corrected)
Blood pressure spikes (corrected)
High blood pressure (corrected although i was working on this prior to my symptoms 4 months ago)
Nerve buzzing( dramatically reduced was all over my body now occasionally under my feet)
Excessive sweating (corrected)
POTS (corrected)
EXTREME CAFFEINE SENSITIVITY there were times where a coffee would put me into SVT ( i just cut out coffee :((((( )
Gum inflammation (corrected)
Internal vibrations (corrected)
Random joint pain ( still have in my left hand particularly with some numbness severity differs day to day possible cubital tunnel involvement)
Fasiculations ( still present but not as violent or as frequent) 
Fatigue (finally wake up refreshed)
Brain fog(i have occasional dumb moments but not as severe)


Heres the list of what I took if you want doses and timing just shoot me a message;

Mag glycinate
Creatine
Amino acids
Zinc + copper
Ubiquinol (best for brain fog and fatigue IMO)
Vit d3 and k2
L theanine
B12 activated form i.e methyl
Benfotamine
Creatine (most researched supp in the world for a reason)
Beetroot extract
Taurine
Omega 3

Stuff im going to add;

NAC
ALA
VITAMIN C AND E
QUERCETIN
L citrulline

Also a hot tip I made major lifestyle changes not just supplementation; for my first month I was pretty much bed bound, my missus forced me up to do some light exercise and get up off my ass no matter how shit i felt. I would walk as soon as i woke up for about 30 mins get some sunlight in, walk barefoot on grass and did some grounding(not sure if this worked or placebo to be honest but give it a go nothing to lose), cold showers, intermittent fasting, cutting out shit foods sugars you know the stuff we always see on the forums. Theres plenty more and im happy to help you guys privately. 

Anywho thats enough from me let me know what you guys think your input would be greatly appreciated 😇😇.

## Is AppleCare Worth it AirPods Max? A cost-Benefit Analysis

This leads us to the million-dollar question: Is AppleCare worth it for your AirPods Max? The answer,as with most things in life,is ""it depends."" Let's break down the factors to consider:

*   **Your Level of Risk Aversion:** Are you generally careful with your electronics, or are you prone to accidents? If you're accident-prone, AppleCare+ can be a worthwhile investment.
*   **Your usage Habits:** How often and where do you use your AirPods Max? If you use them frequently in perhaps hazardous environments (e.g., commuting, working out), the risk of damage increases.
*   **The Cost of Repairs Without AppleCare:** Airpods max repair cost without applecare can be astronomical.A screen replacement or internal component repair could easily cost hundreds of dollars.
*   **The Resale Value:** As mentioned earlier,AppleCare+ can increase the resale value of your AirPods Max,potentially offsetting some of the cost of the plan.
*   **Peace of Mind:** For some,the peace of mind that comes with knowing their AirPods Max are protected is worth the cost of AppleCare+,irrespective of whether they ever need to use it.

To make a more informed decision, let's look at some hypothetical scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Careful User**

You're meticulous about taking care of your electronics. You mostly use your AirPods Max at home or in the office, and you rarely travel with them. In this case, the risk of accidental damage is relatively low. AppleCare+ might not be worth it for you.

**Scenario 2: Active User**

You frequently use your AirPods Max while commuting, traveling, or working out. You're more likely to experience accidental damage.in this case, AppleCare+ is a more attractive proposition.

**Scenario 3: Value-Conscious User**

You're primarily concerned with getting the best value for your money. You're willing to take the risk of paying for repairs out-of-pocket if necessary. In this case, you might want to explore option insurance options or simply self-insure by putting aside money for potential repairs.

Consider the replacement cost vs. the cost of AppleCare. The cost of AppleCare for two years is less than half of a new set of AirPods Max.

## exploring Alternatives to AppleCare+: More Options for AirPods Max Protection

While AppleCare+ is a popular choice, it's not the only option for protecting your AirPods Max. Here are some alternatives to consider:

*   **Third-Party Insurance:** Several companies offer insurance plans specifically for headphones and other electronics. these plans may offer broader coverage than AppleCare+, such as protection against loss or theft. However, be sure to carefully compare the terms and conditions, deductibles, and coverage limitations of these plans. Do your research on third-party insurance.
*   **credit Card Purchase Protection:** Some credit cards offer purchase protection, which can cover accidental damage or theft for a limited time after you purchase your AirPods Max.Check your credit card terms and conditions to see if this benefit is available to you.
*   **Homeowners or renters Insurance:** In certain specific cases, your homeowners or renters insurance policy may cover your AirPods Max if they are damaged or stolen.However, be aware that filing a claim could increase your insurance premiums. Check the terms and conditions of these options.
*   **Self-Insurance:** Instead of purchasing an insurance plan, you could simply set aside money each month to cover potential repair costs. This approach gives you more control over your money,but it also requires discipline and the ability to absorb a potentially large expense.
*   **Extended Warranty from retailers:** Some retailers offer extended warranties that provide similar coverage to AppleCare+. Compare the prices and terms of these warranties to AppleCare+ to see which offers the best value.

1j7fern,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossSupport/comments/1j7fern/committing_to_30lbs_weight_loss/,Committing to 30lbs weight loss,"Needed a place to post this. I am a new, first time mom who already lost about 40lbs postpartum naturally, but now 30lbs remains and much of it is located in an overhanging c-section belly. 
For a while, I wanted to be gentle with myself and maybe just accept that this is what life will be for me now...but I realized, that is not a fact, that is a choice. I can absolutely choose to just focus on other things, and I can equally choose to prioritize eating healthier, drinking more water, and exercising.
I can do this. 

I won't give myself a strict timeframe - I know better than to do that to myself mentally. I think I would like to cap it at a year so that I don't completely take pressure off, either. 

I'd like to keep pushing to 30lbs lost,unless I feel like I've achieved what I set out for before then due to body composition changes.

I will post pictures when I reach my goal - feela a little top vulnerable now, but I will take them once a month to chart my progress.

Plan:
1) Cook at home by planning simpler meals that require less ingredients and are less intimidating overall (easy protein and easy veggie, pepper in the more interesting meals that are habitual at this point like chilis, soups, etc)
I already eat pretty healthy, so my main plan here is to stop getting takeout (even the healthier stuff is loaded with a lot of salt and sugar) except for special occasions.

2) Drink 1 glass of water every hour by setting an alarm on my phone to remind me. I am not drinking enough water at all, but I at least do not drink pop or juice, and I don't put sugar in my coffee. 

3) Aim to move my body intentionally, not just caring for my little one, everyday. Leaving it open-ended so that I can actually accomplish this. Maybe one day I stretch, one day I go for a walk if weather is nice, one day I do a 10min C section recovery workout before bed, etc.

Thank you for being a safe space to, privately but concretely, put this out to the world!!

I finally stared saying “I’m an alcoholic” out loud some where in 22 or 23. The only time I did not drink was at work, otherwise it was game on. My drink of choice is tall boy half and half twisted teas with a nip of orange Smirnoff dumped in and I don’t  just do one, I do 2-4 daily. 4-6 on the weekends. 

I’m married, have 2 kids, decent paying job, I just love drinking and getting tuned up. I’ve had a few stop drinking spells after getting way to drunk and doing something extremely embarrassing or putting my marriage in jeopardy or losing friends but I always came back. Couple of years ago I had to get a physical for my health insurance compliance so I went to a walk in as I haven’t had a pcp since I was a kid. My bloodwork was done, no one told me I had to fast so I pounded an ice coffee that morning like I normally would. Results come back and lady says “Do you know you’re diabetic?”. I chalked that up to not fasting and blew it off. 

2 years ago next week, I quit smoking cigarettes (20 years). I’ve known I have sleep apnea, sweat to death in my sleep or doing any activity somewhere with a temp over 72. Got referred to a sleep doctor and started asking about drinking and my sleep, doctor was more concerned about getting me on the machine than the booze. 

The last year I have been telling myself now that I quit smoking, next is the drinking.  Today’s the day, but rip it into the packy on my way home from work. Next day same thing. My wife finally got both of us a pcp and we just had our first appointments. The doctor goes, “ according to your last bloodwork, you are diabetic and are you not on medication?” I explained yeah didn’t fast, kinda blew it off. I was totally honest about the drinking with her, she had me do bloodwork again. Guess what, diabetic.

So started on all these meds and said to myself, 90% if not more of my issues are drinking.socially, mentally and physically. My kids are still young and I’m not being a very good parent to them so this is it.

Last Tuesday was my last drink. So far I’m doing fine. I have been lurking this sub for over a year and reading everyone’s stories. It’s been a big help.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Creating a metal roof covered patio can add beauty and functionality to your outdoor space. The right plans not only focus on aesthetics but also ensure durability and weather resistance. Here are the essential steps to guide you in crafting effective metal roof covered patio plans.

### Assess Your Space

The first step in designing your patio is assessing the space available. Take measurements and consider the area’s shape and contour. Look for existing structures like trees or fences that might impact your design. Think about how you’ll use the patio—will it serve as a barbecue area, a place to relax, or an outdoor dining spot? Understanding how you intend to use the space will shape your design decisions.

### Select the Right Materials

Choosing the right materials is critical for the longevity and look of your patio. A metal roof can offer benefits such as excellent weather resistance, reflecting heat, and longevity. Here are a few commonly used materials:

Check Details Here: https://roofreplacementfayettevillega.com/  
  
- **Roof Panels:** Consider options like aluminum or galvanized steel for the roofing. Both are durable and resist rust.
- **Support Structures:** Use pressure-treated lumber or metal posts for the frame. They provide stability under the roof.
- **Flooring:** Think about concrete, wood, or pavers that compliment your design and provide a solid base.

### Draft a Detailed Plan

Now that you’ve assessed your space and selected materials, it’s time to draft your patio plan. Start with a simple sketch that outlines the layout, dimensions, and positions of support structures.

#### Include Key Elements in Your Plan

- **Dimensions:** Specify the width, length, and height of the patio.
- **Roof Pitch:** A pitch of at least 3:12 allows water to run off efficiently.
- **Post Locations:** Decide where the vertical supports will go and ensure they support the roofing panels securely.

### Consider Drainage Solutions

A critical aspect of any roofing project is managing water drainage. Make sure your roof design includes proper alignment so that water can easily flow off the edges. Plan for gutters and downspouts if needed. Ensure they divert water away from your property’s foundation to prevent any future issues.

Check Details Here: https://roofreplacementfayettevillega.com/  
  
### Local Building Codes and Permits

Before starting your project, check with your local building department regarding codes and permits. Some areas may have restrictions on the heights of structures or the types of materials used. Getting the right permits will save you from potential fines and ensure your porch is safe to use.

### Prepare the Site

Site preparation is key before actual work begins. Clear the area of debris, vegetation, or old structures. You may need to level the ground. If you're installing concrete or pavers, ensure the base is packed tightly and level for a solid finish.

Check Details Here: https://roofreplacementfayettevillega.com/  
  
### Build the Frame

Start by constructing the frame for your metal roof covered patio. Use consistent measurements for all posts and beams. Securely anchor the posts into the ground or existing concrete slab to provide stability. This framework is what will support the metal roof, so ensure it is sturdy and level.

### Install the Metal Roof

With the frame in place, you can now install the metal roof. Follow these steps:

Check Details Here: https://roofreplacementfayettevillega.com/  
  
- Lay out the roofing panels, starting from one edge to ensure proper alignment.
- Secure the panels to the frame with screws or clips, ensuring they are watertight.
- Install flashing around edges and joints to prevent leaks.

### Add Finishing Touches

Once the structure and roof are complete, it’s time to add personal touches. Consider installing lighting for ambiance, or add outdoor furniture for comfort. Surround your patio with plants or decorative stones to create an inviting atmosphere.

By following these essential steps, you can create effective metal roof covered patio plans that enhance your outdoor living space. A well-planned patio can bring joy for years to come, making your home more enjoyable and functional.

Choosing the Right Materials and Designs for Your Patio Structure
-----------------------------------------------------------------

When designing a patio, the right choice of materials and designs can significantly impact both functionality and aesthetics. A well-constructed patio enhances your outdoor space, providing a comfortable spot for relaxation, entertainment, and quality time with family and friends. Here are some key considerations to keep in mind.

Check Details Here: https://roofreplacementfayettevillega.com/  
  
### Choosing the Right Materials

The materials you select for your patio structure play a vital role in its durability and appearance. Here are some common materials to consider:

- **Wood:** A classic choice, wood offers warmth and versatility. Options like cedar, redwood, or pressure-treated lumber can be aesthetically pleasing. However, they require regular maintenance to prevent rot and weather damage.
- **Concrete:** This material is durable, easy to clean, and resistant to weather. Concrete can be stamped or stained to look like other materials, giving you a customizable option that can match any design.
- **Bricks and Pavers:** These create beautiful patterns and provide excellent drainage. They are sturdy and can last for years with little maintenance. You can choose from various colors and styles, enabling a unique patio design.
- **Metal:** For a modern touch, consider using aluminum or steel. These materials are weather-resistant and low-maintenance. A metal roof can also provide excellent shelter, keeping the area cool while allowing natural light to filter through.

### Assessing Your Climate

Your local climate significantly influences the best materials and designs for your patio. Understanding the weather patterns in your area is essential to making the right choice. Here are some considerations based on climate:

Check Details Here: https://roofreplacementfayettevillega.com/  
  
- If you experience heavy rainfall, select materials that are water-resistant, like concrete or treated wood.
- In hot climates, consider insulated materials that can keep your patio cool. Metal roofs can reflect sunlight, reducing heat buildup underneath.
- For areas prone to snow, ensure your design can withstand the weight of snow accumulation. A pitched roof can help prevent heavy snow from settling.

### Design Elements to Consider

Design is as important as the materials you choose. Here are some key design elements to enhance your patio:

- **Roofing:** A roof provides shade and shelter, essential for a comfortable outdoor experience. Opting for a metal roof can add a stylish touch while providing durability.
- **Flooring:** The flooring of your patio should be slip-resistant and easy to upkeep. Options like textured concrete or treated wood can enhance safety while contributing to the design.
- **Furniture:** The selection of outdoor furniture should complement your design. Lightweight, weather-resistant materials like wicker or aluminum are practical options that add style.
- **Lighting:** ambient lighting can create an inviting atmosphere in the evening. Consider LED lights integrated into the roofing or string lights for a cozy vibe.

### Budget and Maintenance

Your budget is a crucial factor when building your patio. Here's how to balance costs and quality:

Check Details Here: https://roofreplacementfayettevillega.com/  
  
- Prioritize materials that are within your budget but still offer durability.
- Consider the long-term maintenance costs of different materials. Some may be cheaper upfront but more expensive over time due to upkeep.
- Look for seasonal sales or discount suppliers to find quality materials without breaking the bank.

### Getting Professional Help

If you feel overwhelmed by the many options, don’t hesitate to seek professional advice. Landscape designers can guide you in selecting the right materials and creating a unique design that fits your home. They can provide insights you may not have considered, helping you avoid mistakes that could lead to costly repairs later on.

Building a metal roof covered patio can enhance your home’s value while providing a beautiful space for outdoor activities. By carefully selecting materials, considering your design preferences, and planning for maintenance, you’ll create a patio that serves your needs for years to come.

Check Details Here: https://roofreplacementfayettevillega.com/  
  
Choosing the right materials and designs involves evaluating your climate, budget, and desired aesthetic. By taking these factors into account and possibly consulting with professionals, you can create a patio that not only meets your needs but also adds a stylish touch to your home.

### Conclusion

Crafting metal roof covered patio plans can transform your outdoor space into a comfortable and stylish area for relaxation and entertainment. By focusing on essential steps like assessing your space, designing the layout, and measuring accurately, you'll lay a strong foundation for a successful project. Always keep your specific needs and preferences in mind; whether it’s a cozy nook for morning coffee or a vibrant space for family gatherings, having a clear vision is key.

Selecting the right materials is equally crucial. Metal roofing offers durability and a sleek finish, making it ideal for year-round weather protection. Coupling this with the right structural supports will ensure your patio can withstand nature's elements while looking great.

I was wondering about still enjoying high sodium things from time to time.  So long as I keep it under 1500mg a day, I should be ok?  For example, I want to go out and eat my favorite Mexican meal.  Mostly street tacos and the salsa on top.  If that's the only meal I eat that is really high in sodium that day, am I good?  

Right now I'm eating a apple and a banana for breakfast.  12oz of coffee with some surgery and 2% milk then a glass of water.

Lunch I was doing some trail mix with the good nuts and omega 3.  A slice of cheddar cheese, or a slice of cheddar with a can of Tuna with light mayo, pepper, and onion.  Water throughout the day. I'm trying to get a glass of water per hour.

Dinner I'd so chicken breast with olive oil drizzled, pepper, and garlic powder.  Half a potato with a spoon full (not much) of ranch dressing.

Everything online has to scare you it seems like you can never enjoy a meal again like I discussed above. Or a can of high sodium soup will kill you right away.  

I am wanting to lose weight, so I'm starting to walk 30 mins a day as well.  I need to lose 70 pounds.

I am just waiting to get my average down to the 130s/80s and maybe drop a few pills.  

I'm talking about once a week as well.  Mostly I was eating out like that once every 2 to 3 weeks.  I normally wouldn't worry about the rest of the day what I ate, but now I will.

* Day 7: Arrive early-morning. Rent car & sight seeing in North half of Island. Cooking class for lunch. Sunset in Oia. 
* Day 8: Light morning of sight seeing in South half of Island. Sunset wine tour in Fira. Hotel in Imerovigli. 

**Naxos:**

* Day 9: Arrive late-morning. Lunch, exploring, and walking dinner food tour in Old City. 
* Day 10: Primary beach day - exploring on the leeward side of the Island. 
* Day 11: Primary village day - heading inland to explore small villages, pottery shops, and more. 
* Day 12: Slow morning. Heading to Eggares Olive Oil Museum. Evening boat to Milos. Dinner in Pollonia, Milos. 

**Milos:**

* Day 13: Full day Catamaran tour around the Island. 
* Day 14: Primary city day - exploring landmarks around Plaka, shopping, eating. 
* Day 15: Primary beach day - begin on north end of island moving south. Dinner on south end. 
* Day 16: Last day. Coffee in Pollonia. Lunch in Mandrakia @ Medusa. Airport -> ATH -> HOME. (Business Class)

My general philosophy for planning this trip were (1) no more than one tour per day (2) we do not have to hit every landmark, restaurant, or other location I have on the maps (3) I wanted to group recommended ‘things’ by general location to make it more efficient. 

There are a few restaurants that are locked in or we are definitely going (e.g. the tasting menu @ Casa de Cha da Boa Nova in Porto). For all of the others, I have compiled recommendations for food based on where in a city we’re planning to be at a specific time of day, but obviously if we see locals going somewhere else or recommending something else, we’re definitely open to adapt as we go. 

Total cost for 16 days of travel, hotels, flights, food estimates was approximately $11,000 and 500k airline miles. Should I quit my day job and go into travel planning? ",1,1741547674.0,honeymoonplanning,0,1.0,False

I (23M, 1m80, 127kg) am looking to loose weight, thought I would document my journey on here for accountability and advice from big guys like me, as well as maybe motivating other to hop on the train and share some of my own advice.

# Where I come from:

Since childhood (around age 5), I've struggled with being overweight due to poor nutrition. My immigrant mother worked extensively to support our family, making nutrition a secondary concern.

By age 15, my parents noticed my weight increasing and implemented an extremely restrictive diet (rice with raw vegetables) that I had to follow alone. This approach backfired, leading to eating disorders where I would secretly hoard junk food in my bedroom. Professional consultations proved unsuccessful.

Eventually, my parents realized they couldn't force weight loss and that motivation needed to come from within me. Though I disliked being obese, I wasn't motivated to change at that time.

When I moved out for university, my situation worsened as I gained unrestricted access to junk food, reaching 130kg. This became my turning point.

During the first two lockdowns, I managed to reduce my weight to 116kg by significantly cutting down on fast food and regularly exercising with a friend. However, subsequent lockdowns, loss of that friend, and depression caused me to regain weight, returning to 130kg over 1.5 years and abandoning my exercise routine.

# Where I am today:

I now feel much better. Moving to a better apartment with an actual kitchen has made cooking less of a chore. My weight has stabilized at 127kg and hasn't changed for about a year, suggesting I've found something of a balance.

# Positive Changes I've Made:

* **Fast Food**: Reduced from 12-15 times weekly to about 3 times per week
* **Soft Drinks**: Decreased from 4-5 cans of coke daily to approximately 1 every two days
* **Snacks**: Lost interest in candies, chocolate, and biscuits (down to \~200g monthly)
* **Breakfast**: Eliminated it entirely as I don't feel hungry in the mornings
* **Coffee**: Working toward enjoying it without sugar (currently at half a sugar per cup)
* **Cooking**: Developed a varied diet with satisfying, compelling meals that prevent me from resorting to Uber Eats

# Current Challenges:

* **Portion Control**: I still struggle with quantities, especially when eating out (ordering the largest sizes, multiple burgers)
* **Finishing Everything**: I often force myself to finish meals even when I'm clearly full
* **Home Cooking**: While healthier, I tend to cook about 30% more than I should eat

# Physical Activity:

* I have a sedentary job
* Recently started walking instead of driving when possible
* Considering returning to the gym independently (primarily for mental health benefits)

# My Goal

I aim to get below 100kg, with no specified timeline. I'm focused on sustainable changes rather than quick fixes.

# What I learned so far:

* **Self-acceptance is capital**: It's extremely difficult to lose weight if you hate yourself or your body. I couldn't make progress until I found peace with myself. If now doesn't feel like the right time, that's okay—you'll know when you're ready.
* **Sugar is a drug**: Especially in drinks. I found it's easier to skip the first soda than the ones that follow. Sugary drinks create a cycle of craving more and more.
* **Patience is crucial**: Weight loss and speed don't mix well. Set realistic goals and don't be too hard on yourself.
* **Sustainability matters more than intensity**: It's counterproductive to start habits you can't maintain long-term. One dietician told me something that initially seemed odd but now makes perfect sense: ""Diets are absolutely stupid. People don't need diets, they need to adjust their lifestyle.""
* **There will be ups and downs**: They're normal and inevitable. The most important thing is to never guilt yourself into returning to bad habits. Tomorrow is always an opportunity to do better.
* **Self-awareness**: Understanding exactly why and how you reached this point can help you identify specific habits to change.
* **Everyone is unique**: My advice comes from personal experience and may not apply to everyone. Listen to your body and don't hesitate to seek professional help. I was initially ashamed to get external support, but putting words to my experience was incredibly helpful.
* **Only compare yourself to you**: We all know someone who lost an impressive amount of weight quickly. Don't worry about that—this is your journey, so take it at your own pace.

So yeah that's about it for my post, got everything out of my mind. Would love feedback from people that had the same struggles as me. And good luck to all of you!",1,1741547481.0,WeightlossJourney,0,1.0,False

I would like to find a group of similar age people, who are planning on staying in Paris at least for a while, with whom, if we click, we could go out and share different activities, for example: walks, picnics, concerts, shows, going to museums, ping-pong, darts etc.

A bit about myself, I'm into watching stand-up comedy, I listen to mostly funk music, I also like a lot of rap, rnb, rock (really looking forward to Kendrick x Sza this summer) ..I am a bit shy at first, trying to break out of that, friends tell me I must have ocd, but I don't claim it, I'm chill I swear 😂 I go to school most days of the week, and work on the weekends.

If anyone would like to meet sometimes with similar interests and intentions, let me know, share a bit about yourself, and we can organise a coffee meetup or something. I would like it to be mostly a girl, or mixed group of people, nothing against guys, I would just like to avoid meeting creepy men from Reddit in the wild, I'm not looking for a date, just potential friendship with like minded people.

I speak english better than french, but I can also hold a conversation in french, I understand 90% of what I hear, and feel like I can express myself 60, 70% of the way..so wouldn't mind people who speak both, that way I can become a bit more comfortable in speaking french.

The FOOD. Tons and tons of very delicious food and it’s a big part of the show that gilmore girls love eating all kinds of food and drinking lots and lots of coffee. 

However almost never we actually see them eating that food. And now I can’t unsee it. Sookie offers something delicious and character says yes please but then just holds the food in hand and keeps talking never actually trying it. Or at Lukes Lorelai wants coffee and Luke pours it to her and they keep talking and after awhile Lorelai leaves without drinking any of that. Or often times we see aftermath of a movie marathon and lots of food half eaten but don’t actually see them eating. 

It’s really not that serious and obviously it’s not real life. Still I now find myself noticing lot of the times when they are eating that they aren’t actually eating at all.

Today we had a long fight, I paid our entrance at a museum and at lunch we had pizza, I paid it before her and she got real mad. I told her to not make a big deal about this and she can pay for coffee, but she insisted to pay me back, first I refused and then I let her pay because she was really mad. The nail in the coffin came when we were arguing about she wanting to pay for coffee too and told me “that’s it, we break up, I don’t love you anymore”, and I got really hurt. I told her when we calmed down a little that she hurts me when she says things like that (this not being the first time when she says something like that during a disagreement) and she said “I can’t say any joke around you cause you get mad”.

The two things that need to work are:

1. I need to set off the sensor
2. I need them to take my money and give me coffee in return

So, I courageously but nonchalantly Onewheeled up to the speaker, hoping that I would set off the sensor. A mere one or two seconds later, I hear them over the speaker. Woo! Step one worked.

As I Onewheeled up to the window, I crossed my fingers that they'd be cool about it. To my surprise, they were cooler about it than I expected and were enthusiastic to serve me. They were surprised that I set the sensor off and didn't mind me Onewheeling through the drive thru one bit. I even asked if corporate had any rules against it, and they said there were no rules against it. Yay! Step two worked.

**TL;DR: Mission accomplished. Coffee acquired.**

1j7eu5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1j7eu5m/my_husband_never_shuts_up/,My husband never shuts up,"Our marriage was an arranged marriage through a fundamentalist religious sect. We were married at a young age against my wishes, but for the most part, we have an amicable marriage. However we are very incompatible in alot of ways, and one of those ways is how much attention we need to be happy. For me, I’m fine talking a little bit and going about my day mostly  in silence and catching up a bit at the end of the day. I can get along with people who like to chat, but my husband is on the extreme end of the spectrum and never.shuts.up. I mean never. He narrates every single thought inside of his head and every action as he does it.As soon as I wake up in the morning, he is waiting outside the door to give me a long 5 minute embrace and begin talking about his upcoming day, how we slept, the weather, anything and everything all before I’ve had a sip of coffee. From then on out he narrates everything he does all day, the only break I get is when he leaves for work. Example, he’s in the kitchen making himself some lunch-
“I’m making myself some lunch”
“Nice”
“I’m trying something new”
“Cool, that looks good let me know how it comes out”
“I’m adding chicken, salsa, and cream cheese now”
“Yum!”
“Now I’m going to heat it up on the stove”
“Good idea sounds good”
“After this I’m going take a shower”
“Cool, I’ll go after you”

And on and on and on and on.

If I try to ignore him, he will do this thing where he makes leading statements to make me engage or ask him about something that he’s waiting for me to ask. For example if he needs me to talk more, he will say something like “I just got off the phone with my boss” I’ll say “oh?” Then he stares at me until I realize he isn’t going to continue the sentence at my prompting and  that’s my cue to ask him a lot of questions about it because he wants to talk in depth about it but needs me to ask about it first. It’s never any big news or anything like that, he just wants to talk about it and absolutely needs me involved in the conversation and will make statements where I sort of”have” to ask about it. Kind of like when people post on Facebook “I need prayers today” but don’t say why, so everyone has to comment and ask what’s going on.
. I’ve tried multiple times to tell him I’m not the type of person who has the bandwidth to talk so much, or that I need time to decompress, but doing so only results in him either pouting for days or panicking that I don’t love him anymore. It’s driving me insane, and it feels like I constantly have to perform in my own house. I would love to be able to sit down and read every once in a while, or tune out and relax and watch a tv show, but he never stops talking even when I try to do those things and asking him for silence causes a whole other set of problems.  It feels a lot like having a needy toddler and I just need to vent about this and hoping to hear advice from others who have found ways to cope with having a spouse who has no “off” button. Before I was married off, I was homeschooled and helped raise my 7 siblings so I have quite literally not had a moment of peace my entire life and it gets harder with each year that goes by. I can’t even drive to the store  or run errands by myself for a few moments of peace  because he insists on coming and we have to talk the entire time. If I say I want to go alone he takes that deeply personal and he pouts. I cannot speak to anyone in my family about this, complaining about your husband is nearly forbidden unless there is physical abuse.  ",1,1741546924.0,offmychest,4,1.0,False

This month for me marks one year from the start of my symptoms, which started with dizziness - the cause which I believe is a ""neck injury"" where I had my neck in an odd position and heard an extremely loud pop/crack. I've had about 20 symptoms happen since, but I have to admit, the most debilitating one is the cervical/cervicogenic dizziness, which some people will call different things like ""supermarket syndrome"" or others just label it ""photosensitivity"" or ""photophobia"" etc.

I think for some people it varies, but for me:

\- I can only last like 5-10 minutes in a supermarket / grocery store / mall / busy bright place with people before I start feeling horrible dizzy-like agitation, discomforts, trouble breathing, panic/anxiety, and it sometimes can lead to a full blown panic attack.  
\- When my dizziness levels are high (this varies day by day, month by month, etc.) I sometimes can barely look at screens, especially when something is moving on them. If the dizziness is really high, lights in general ""burn"" my eyes and agitate me. I had to download programs to dim my screens beyond their most dim settings (both mac and PC).  
\- Doing physical things is difficult and makes my dizziness worse, especially if it's something that requires tilting my head down, or any repetitive movements involving my neck, eyes, etc. Sometimes a few hours of bad physical activity in a day can worsen my ""dizziness"" for 1-2 weeks.  
\- Car rides are hit or miss and can be quite triggering and panic-inducing at times  
\- Sitting in a cafe/restaurant across from a person and just talking to someone is extremely triggering for me and I often have to fight onsets of panic attacks. I believe this could be because looking at someone during conversation will cause little movements and your eyes have to track someone's eyes constantly (which are never fully still) so maybe that contributes to the dizziness.

So overall, this has ruined my work life (working on computers), my physical life (doing physical activities), and my social life (difficult to even catch up with someone for coffee).

I've spent 100 hours looking on reddit so I know there are others who suffer from this type of symptom, but I think it's still helpful to write a reminder here for others: you're not alone.

I've been trying things: physio, massage therapy, chiropractor, and at home a combination of neck strengthening, massaging, applying heat, etc. and so far I haven't found a combination of things to help me. I'm going to keep trying things, so feel free to share your own person tips.

I am looking for a home coffee machine for a fairly cheap amount.

I've looked into a few options and there's 2 that feel okay to me (agaro imperial and budan espresso), but I'm here for your opinion and hopefully other better alternatives. 

As for budget I don't want spend too much on a coffee machine so I'm restricting it to 25k but I'm hoping for cheaper honestly.

F, 5’6”, 21 yrs old. multiple multi day fasts done, my third extended fast of this length. i supplemented my electrolytes following the guidelines stated in the sidebar and wiki. started fasting january 26th and i estimate i weighed about 290 lbs (131 kg). this morning i weighed in at 256.2 lbs (116 kg), 34 lbs (15 kg) lost overall. 

the actual fasting wasn’t too hard. hunger went away after 10 days. the first 5 days which i know are notorious for being the worst weren’t awful, just annoying as i adjusted to no more food or daily iced coffees. i was tired some days but honestly i am a bit depressed (college 🙃) so it’s hard to differentiate between physical and mental tiredness anymore. 

the cravings never went away. i went to bed last night craving food and woke up craving food, lol. what’s funny though is that as soon as i sat down to eat my meal today, one i’ve been thinking about for so long, it didn’t interest me at all. eating genuinely bored me. also - every food fantasy i’ve been having, especially fast food and junk food, just suddenly evaporated. i no longer craved them. i guess the idea of eating/eating that type of food is better than actually eating it?

i don’t think i’ll be fasting this long again. at least not any time soon. this is likely going to be a once a year thing for me. my fasting plan for after this is to stick with intermittent fasting for a week or so, and then eventually start up some rolling fasts to lose the rest of the weight (i would like to lose at least 100 lbs/45 kg). 

i’m truly glad i’m fasted. it was a good learning opportunity and a chance for me to work on my relationship with food. and i’m grateful for such an awesome community <3 if anyone has any questions or concerns, i’ll gladly answer!",63,1741546397.0,fasting,21,0.98,False

Imagine stumbling upon a charming coastal village that perfectly blends traditional Greek life with modern comforts. 
That&#8217;s exactly what I found when I visited Kastri, a delightful seaside haven in southern Crete.
Kastri is a beautiful coastal village located 72 kilometers southeast of Heraklion, nestled in the protected bay of Keratokambos. 
It&#8217;s the larger of two settlements in the area, with its neighbor Keratokambos now seamlessly blending into it. 




During my visit, I was struck by how this once quiet fishing village has gracefully evolved to welcome tourists while maintaining its authentic charm. 
The surrounding beaches have played a significant role in Kastri&#8217;s growth, attracting visitors who fall in love with its peaceful atmosphere and friendly locals. 
Many families, including mine, find themselves returning year after year, drawn by the laid back vibe and stunning coastline. 
It&#8217;s no wonder Kastri has become a go to destination for those seeking a tranquil Greek getaway.

Getting to Kastri is a breeze. 
I drove from Heraklion, taking the road that connects Ano Viannos to the capital. 
The journey took about 45-55 minutes, offering beautiful views of the Cretan landscape along the way. 
One of Kastri&#8217;s standout features is its unique port, the only one in the wider region. 
As I strolled along the waterfront, I watched local fishermen tending to their boats, providing a glimpse into the village&#8217;s traditional way of life. 
Adjacent to the port, I discovered a small but beautiful sandy beach. 
Fringed by tamarisk trees, it offers natural shade and a perfect spot for a lazy afternoon. 
What I loved most about this beach was its proximity to the village amenities. 
Rooms, tavernas, and shops are just a stone&#8217;s throw away, making it incredibly convenient for families with young children. 
For those looking to explore further, the long Skouros beach stretches out to the west, offering even more space to soak up the sun and sea. 
Kastri isn&#8217;t just about beaches, though. I made sure to visit the Church of St. Demetrius Galatoktistos, a former monastery with a fascinating history. 
Another highlight was the chapel of St. George Vagionitis, surrounded by a lush garden that provides a serene retreat from the bustling beach life. 
Whether you&#8217;re a fan of Heraklion beaches or looking to explore a different side of Crete, Kastri offers a perfect blend of relaxation, culture, and natural beauty. 
It&#8217;s a destination that captures the heart of what makes Cretorama so special.

Kastri Beach Profile
Kastri&#8217;s main beach is a sandy paradise that stretches alongside the village port. 
As I walked along the shoreline, I felt the soft sand between my toes and admired the crystal clear waters that seemed to invite me for a swim. 
What struck me most was how clean and well maintained the beach was. 
It&#8217;s evident that the local community takes pride in preserving their coastal treasure. 
The beach isn&#8217;t vast, but it&#8217;s spacious enough to accommodate visitors without feeling crowded. 
The gentle slope into the sea makes it ideal for families with young children. 
I watched as kids splashed in the shallows, their parents relaxing nearby under the shade of tamarisk trees. 
For those seeking more space, Skouros Beach to the west offers a longer stretch of coastline.
Here, I found a mix of sand and pebbles, adding variety to the beach experience in Kastri.




Amenities
Kastri&#8217;s beach is well equipped to ensure a comfortable day by the sea. 
Umbrellas and sunbeds are available for rent, offering a perfect spot to relax and soak up the sun. 
The beach also has clean shower facilities and changing rooms, making it easy to freshen up after a swim. 
For those who forget to pack essentials, there are small shops nearby selling beach supplies, snacks, and refreshments. 
I found this incredibly convenient when I needed to restock on sunscreen. 
The proximity of the village means that restaurants and cafes are just a short walk away, perfect for when you need a break from the sun or a hearty meal after a day of swimming.




Accommodations
Kastri  Beach offers a variety of accommodation options to suit different preferences and budgets. 
During my stay, I noticed several family run guesthouses and small hotels scattered throughout the village. 
Many of these accommodations are within walking distance of the beach, which I found incredibly convenient. 
I stayed in a charming apartment with a sea view, run by a local family who went out of their way to make me feel welcome. 
For those preferring more space, there are also vacation rentals available, ranging from cozy studios to larger houses that can accommodate families or groups. 
While Kastri Beach doesn&#8217;t have large resort style hotels, I found this added to its charm and helped maintain the village&#8217;s authentic atmosphere. 
The accommodations here offer a more personal touch, allowing visitors to experience true Cretan hospitality.




History and Significance
Kastri&#8217;s history is deeply rooted in its connection to the sea. 
The village has been a fishing community for generations, and this heritage is still evident today in its bustling port and the local fishing boats that dot the harbor. 
One of the most significant historical sites I visited was the Church of St. Demetrius Galatoktistos. 
This former monastery holds a special place in local lore. 
The name &#8220;Galatoktistos&#8221; translates to &#8220;built with milk,&#8221; referring to a legend that claims the church was constructed using milk instead of water in the mortar. 
Another important religious site is the chapel of St. George Vagionitis. 
Surrounded by a beautiful garden, this chapel serves as a peaceful retreat and a testament to the area&#8217;s religious history. 
While exploring the village, I learned that Kastri has played a role in various historical periods, from ancient times through the Venetian and Ottoman occupations. 
Today, it stands as a living example of how a traditional Cretan village can adapt to modern times while preserving its unique character and heritage.




Activities
Kastri offers a variety of activities for visitors of all ages. During my stay, I found plenty to keep me entertained: 
Swimming and sunbathing are, of course, the main attractions.
The calm, clear waters are perfect for a refreshing dip, and the sandy beach is ideal for lounging. 
Snorkeling is popular along the rocky parts of the coastline. I brought my own gear and was amazed by the variety of fish and marine life I saw just offshore. 
For the more adventurous, there are opportunities for kayaking and paddleboarding. 
I rented a kayak for a few hours and enjoyed exploring the coastline from a different perspective. 
Hiking enthusiasts will appreciate the nearby trails that offer stunning views of the Libyan Sea. 
I took a short hike to a viewpoint overlooking the village and was rewarded with breathtaking panoramas. 
In the village itself, I enjoyed exploring the local shops and trying my hand at traditional crafts in a workshop organized by a local cultural association. 
For those interested in religious tourism, visiting the historic churches and chapels provides insight into the area&#8217;s spiritual heritage. 
Lastly, simply strolling through the village streets and chatting with locals at the kafeneions (traditional Greek cafes) was an activity in itself, offering a genuine taste of Cretan life.




Dining
The dining scene in Kastri is a delightful blend of traditional Cretan cuisine and fresh seafood.
Several traditional tavernas line the waterfront, offering stunning views along with their meals. 
I enjoyed a fantastic dinner of grilled octopus and local wine while watching the sunset over the sea. 
For lunch, I often opted for small, family run eateries in the village center. 
Here, I tasted authentic Cretan dishes like dakos (a local bread salad) and kalitsounia (cheese pies). 
The seafood in Kastri is exceptionally fresh, often caught that very morning by local fishermen. 
I recommend trying the catch of the day, which is usually displayed proudly by the tavernas. 
For a quick snack or coffee, there are several cafes and bakeries scattered throughout the village. 
Don&#8217;t miss the chance to try some local products. 
Many restaurants serve locally produced olive oil, cheese, and honey, showcasing the rich culinary heritage of the region. 
For those who prefer to self cater, there are small grocery stores in the village where you can buy fresh produce and other essentials.




Best For Travelers
From my experience, Kastri is particularly well suited for certain types of travelers: 
Families will appreciate the calm waters, sandy beach, and proximity of amenities. The laid-back atmosphere makes it easy to keep an eye on children while still enjoying a relaxing vacation. 
Couples seeking a romantic getaway will find plenty of quiet spots and cozy tavernas for intimate dinners. 
Nature lovers and outdoor enthusiasts can enjoy hiking, snorkeling, and exploring the surrounding landscapes. 
Culture seekers will appreciate the village&#8217;s authentic character, historic churches, and opportunities to interact with locals. 
Foodies will delight in the fresh seafood and traditional Cretan cuisine available in the local tavernas. 
Photographers will find endless inspiration in the picturesque village scenes, beautiful sunsets, and stunning coastal views. 
Kastri is ideal for those looking to experience a more authentic side of Crete, away from the larger tourist resorts. 
It&#8217;s perfect for travelers who value peace, natural beauty, and a slower pace of life.

Tips
Based on my experience in Kastri, here are some tips to make your visit even more enjoyable: 
Best time to visit: I found May to October ideal, with warm temperatures and minimal rainfall. July and August can be busy, so consider visiting in the shoulder seasons for a quieter experience. 
Sun protection: The Cretan sun is strong. Bring high-SPF sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses. The tamarisk trees offer some shade, but it&#8217;s limited. 
Water shoes: While the main beach is sandy, some nearby beaches are pebbly. Water shoes can be helpful. 
Cash: Many small businesses in Kastri prefer cash. There&#8217;s an ATM in the village, but it&#8217;s good to bring some cash with you. 
Language: While many locals speak some English, learning a few Greek phrases can go a long way in making connections. 
Respect local customs: Kastri is a traditional village. Dress modestly when visiting churches or walking through the village. 
Explore beyond the beach: Take time to wander the village streets, visit the local churches, and interact with locals for a richer experience. 
Try local products: Don&#8217;t miss the chance to taste locally produced olive oil, cheese, and honey. 
Book in advance: If you&#8217;re visiting during peak season, it&#8217;s wise to book accommodation in advance.

We started daiting when we were both still in college, but our relationship grew serious really quickly. After year off beeing together we moved in together, and we bought a dog together. I've seen my relationship as perfect one for really long time, my girlfriend is absolutly beautiful, and when we started she was so carring so sweet, lovely person to have around all the time. She would allways tell me where she is, with who she is (I never asked her to do that, but she would allways tell me by herself), she would send me sweet texts, or call me while she's driving, we would plan cute dates, and take trips very often. Every night we would go walk our dog, then went on coffee together after it. She would compliment my outfits, and tell me how beautiful I was. She would drive me to college, later work, even too I had my own car all the time.

But two years ago she started changing, small changes at first. At first number off texts fell down, but I wasn't worried as we live together. Then she stoped complimenting me, we stoped with dates and I would walk our dog alone every night, as she would come home pretty late. Now I'm aware my gf has serious job, and makes much more money then me, but I also know she doesn't work for 12 hours. For last 6 months she lost any interest in small talks with me, some nights she doesn't even sleep home (she says she stays at her other condo because it's closer to her work), she doesn't pay any attention to me or our dog. Every time I would ask if she has any problem she would say no, and when I asked if she's cheating she lost her shit, saying how I'm crazy for asking that, that she would never do that. When I tryed to talk or fix something she would just say that we don't have any problems and that she loves me.

Other night she came home drunk and woke me up to have sex with her, first time in months that she wanted to do it, but she was waisted so I told her to just sleep. She got angry with me and told me how I deserve how she treats me, and then she sleept in living room that night. That was three days ago and since then she haven't spoke a single word with me.

I'm going crazy. I'm honestly sick off crying for months now, and off listening to my friends telling me how I should leave her. I know I'm not happy, and it feels like I have a roomate who can't stand me, instead off girlfriend.

Black sesame and pandan both pair well with the garam masala, and both can work as savory or sweet flavors. Then, round out the drink with a savory, oak-forward rum. I use Mt. Gay Black Barrel; the aged El Dorado offerings would probably work here too, but I can't get them at liquor stores in Ohio.

**Black Sesame Pandan Old-Fashioned Recipe**

- 2oz Mt. Gay Black Barrel
- 1/4oz Black Sesame Pandan Syrup
- 2 dashes Garam Masala Bitters
- *Garnish:* Dehydrated lime wheel dipped in simple syrup and coated with sesame seeds

Stir all ingredients over ice and strain into a double rocks glass with a large clear ice cube. Garnish with the sesame-coated dehydrated lime wheel.

One note about the bitters: we ran out of the small bottle my friend bought while testing the recipe, so we tried making our own. That recipe follows. The homemade bitters were much spicier, but otherwise similar in flavor.

**Black Sesame Pandan Syrup Recipe**

- 65g Water
- 32.5g Coconut Sugar

1j7ei65,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/1j7ei65/the_hard_truth_about_market_validation/,The Hard Truth About Market Validation,"Ever launched something… and heard crickets?

I still remember the sinking feeling. I had spent weeks—no, *months*—building my “brilliant” startup idea. Sleepless nights, coffee-fueled coding sessions, and the kind of excitement that makes you forget to eat. I was *so sure* this was going to be the next big thing.

Then launch day came… and nothing happened. No signups. No buzz. Not even *hate comments* (which honestly, would have been something).

I had done everything *except* the one thing that mattered most: **validation.**

Here’s the mistake I made (and the one I see so many entrepreneurs make):

* I assumed my idea was great because *I* loved it.
* I thought I “knew” my market without actually testing it.
* I spent months building when I should have spent **days validating.**

Fast forward to today, and my approach is completely different. I no longer spend months *guessing*. Now, before I invest real time or money, I do a quick reality check:

✅ Is there an actual *demand* for this?

✅ Are people already *spending money* on this problem?

✅ How much *competition* is out there?

✅ If I launched today, would I even *stand a chance*?

Instead of guessing, I’ve found ways to get this clarity in *minutes*—market size, competitor landscape, even a rough ROI estimate. And let me tell you, it has saved me from chasing *so many* bad ideas.

Curious—how do you personally validate your ideas? Do you rely on gut instinct, surveys, competitor research, or something else?

For those who are in the same boat, I’ve been working on a way to simplify this entire process (not a sales pitch, just sharing my journey!). Happy to chat if you’re navigating the same struggles. 🚀

1j7eh9v,https://i.redd.it/lnw7p7fempne1.jpeg,Could this be thyroid issues?,"I’m a 27-year-old woman with a history of hormonal issues, specifically hypothyroidism (supposedly under control) and poly-microfollicular ovaries, which used to cause very irregular periods (that’s why I started taking birth control pills). I also have many allergies and asthma, for which I take montelukast and loratadine. I also got COVID a couple of times in the past years.

A few years ago, I was diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism due to an elevated TSH level but normal T4. I took medication, and my TSH returned to normal. However, I’ve recently been experiencing some symptoms, and I’m concerned that I might have a thyroid issue.

First of all, my neck is quite thick—wider than the average person’s. I’m not super thin, but I’m also not very large. It could just be genetics or fat, but I can feel two “masses” on the sides of my neck, not super large or anything but I noticed that is not the case for everyone, and I’m wondering if this could be related to my thyroid.

Here are some other things I’ve noticed: 

•	Low energy levels – I’ve never been an extremely active person, so it’s hard to tell, but I tend to feel tired easily. 

•	Sleepiness – This affects me a lot. I get sleepy very easily, especially after meals, but not only then. I usually sleep around 7 hours, so it’s not a lack of sleep. Also, I’m very sensitive to a bad night’s sleep—it can leave me feeling drowsy throughout the day. Coffee and energy drinks don’t seem to work for me. 

•	Cold sensitivity – I read this could be a symptom. At work, we have air conditioning, and I often feel cold when others don’t. Sometimes someone says it’s hot, and I don’t feel it at all. Usually I need to be at 75-77F to feel confortable (I am in a tropical country which tends to reach 86F easily on dry season) 

•	Weight gain – This one is tricky. As I mentioned, I’m not very active, and I do enjoy eating something sweet or a piece of bread with coffee occasionally. However, I’m quite mindful of my portions, and if I’m not careful, I can easily gain 2-3 kg (4-7 lbs) in just a few weeks. 

•	Hair thinning – Over the past few years, I’ve noticed that I have less hair, and people have told me it looks very fine. 

•	Constipation – I’ve always had a slow metabolism, usually going to the bathroom once every 2-3 days. But a few weeks ago, I experienced severe constipation that caused pain and bleeding. I’m doing better now by drinking more water and eating fruit daily.

I will definitely discuss all of this with my doctor, but I’d like to hear from people who have experience with thyroid issues. Could this be related, or am I just overthinking it? Also, is it possible to have thyroid problems even if my TSH and T4 levels are normal?",0,1741546002.0,thyroidhealth,0,0.5,False
1j7eh9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1j7eh9o/too_poor_and_sad_to_be_trans/,Too poor and sad to be trans,"For the last six months I’ve had a very difficult time finding a full time job. I live in Texas, and I do 20 hours a week at a fast food place.

I’ve hit my late 20s, I’ve been on hrt for 4(5?) years now, and I’ve been really stressed about aging and death lately. I’ve been systemically dealing with addiction and mental health. In the last year, I’ve quit drinking, smoking (mostly), vaping, and coffee. I got a bipolar diagnosis. Those things have been going well I suppose.

In terms of my transition, I recognize that we don’t always have the most accurate perceptions of ourselves as we change, but I’m 6’5” and 140lbs, so aside from less body hair and some chest growth I haven’t seen too, too much externally. I’ve known that FFS is a big goal for me for pretty much all of my twenties, but I’ve made 0 progress on that front. I’m not the most fem person, and my #transitiongoals tend to be more like high waisted pants chap stick lesbian (idefk anymore)

I’m wondering if I’ve just hit a phase in my transition of like “well this is where we’ve landed”. I don’t have the gender euphoria I did as a young adult. I feel more like a tall queer male with tits. I get dirty looks all of the time, and don’t really see or know other trans feminine people in my day to day. When I do see them, they’re usually way better looking. I’ve been depressed- make up has become this huge chore, trying to affect my voice or the way I move has become a huge chore. Transition used to be kind of a hopeful question, but it’s been “answered” and now it’s like a daily uphill struggle against the reality of my body. My facial hair is starting to come back after a year since I stopped LHR because of my income.

Any amount of being gendered correctly by friends or strangers has started to feel like pity. I could be wrong, but I generally look like a guy, unless I wear lots of makeup and a tight shirt, then I imagine I look like “a guy trying to look like a girl”. Some people are nice enough to clock that and be respectful.

I guess, when all I ever wear is a work uniform, and I only ever see my coworkers, and I don’t have any money or foresee having any, it can feel like I’m “not even trans”. What’s gender matter when I’m choosing whether to buy a loaf of bread or some eyeliner with my last $8? What’s it matter when I could be homeless in the next two years anyway? What am I even doing?

I’ve started feeling gender envy when I see trans women online, just like I used to with cis women. Like I’m not one of them. And it’s like, this has been my whole life? Of course I’m trans. But I just feel tall. I just feel huge and long and poor and sad. And all the transphobia in the news is doing a number on me. It feels like the reality of my existence is entirely subject to the opinions and whims of the people around me who are either going to affirm or deny my womanhood.

Lmao, I guess, I’m just sharing, curious if anyone will read this and have something to say.",2,1741546001.0,MtF,3,0.63,False

I have a business where well off Airbnb Priperty management (2 different package tiers) and another Monthly Maintenance/Inspection package.

My goal is to have create a database for these properties with relevant property info -  (size, service provided, door codes, etc.

For each home we create a unique check list each month (changing filters, descaling coffee machine, etc.) I’d love to be able to go into the property record - check off while working the list and have it repopulate for next month. 

I’m thinking of creating a checklist within the “task” (home address field) but don’t know the best way to have the list come back. Should I just save each unique list as a template and load it up again? Is their an automation or recurring way of doing that?

Outside of that issue I’m thinking of creating another list of property owner info for billing info etc, and another list for our package services and using relationships to connect it all together. As some owners have multiple properties were taking care of.

If anyone has any insight on how I should maybe structure this and have these checklists or tasks related to the property I’d much appreciate it.

I mean,  
Nobody in his right mind,  
Anyone with a house left,  
I mean to say,  
Would have his heart elsewhere. Right?  
The rightful owners of highways are the roadkill, the homeless, the streetwalkers,  
The crushed thistles, rabid dogs, and crippled Bambis.  
That’s what he used to say, anyway.

/For the last time, Lose y o u r f a i t h in m e./

  
Not tonight.

Tonight, I drove 17 miles from home to reach a nowhere  
That my father’s stopping heart turned into a destination.  
/I was too late./  
...I arrived just on time.  
But I don’t recognize the red in his face.  
Is it the asphalt?  
The bottle?  
August?  
Guilt?  
It does not matter—  
It’s dripping down his temple.

But,  
76 miles an hour,  
Not even his fastest.  
Not even close.  
Not even fast enough to make the news.  
Except this time, it worked.  
He was coming home.  
Except, he did not.  
The radio ran out of songs on the way back home.

My sister asks me to write his obituary.  
You’ve known him the longest, she says.  
What do I tell her?  
Our father,  
The proud carpenter,  
A Jesus from an ever-burning orphanage,  
He built us cradles out of pine trees,  
And for our mother, swings.  
Our mother, the tiniest hummingbird,

Made of the finest china.  
They met at a jazz club.  
Where do I start?  
Our mother said he used to sing Sinatra into her belly then,  
Would swear I sang back.

  
He used to refuse drinks once, you know?  
Until the demand couldn’t fill the gap,  
Between timber and bills.  
When the trees stopped growing fast enough,  
Then,  
Our father,  
At the construction site,  
At the deck,  
At the factory,  
At the mine.  
He used to reserve the cruelest slurs for the Fords,  
For fish funk, sulfur stains,  
The black earth, tetanus,  
Fingers lost to the grind,  
And coming back to night-filled rooms,  
To sleep on the couch with shoes on.

Oh and one time,

He sat on the porch for a whole summer.  
Taught me my ABCs, to roll cigars,  
To pick berries, kill mosquitoes, and feed the dogs.

To sing ungracefully,

And to live unpolished, with cracks, and peeling skin,

Every day, he took us swimming at the harbor,  
Then home to canned beans, mashed potatoes, and ice cream.  
On colder nights, I used to draw hearts on his beer-soaked breath,  
But I guess our mother must have seen it coming.

  
One night, she slipped through the back door.  
Not sure when—  
Was it when the daisies wilted?  
The last can of beans?  
The cold sheets? The crickets? The neighbors? The time?  
Maybe it was when Dad stopped singing.  
All I know is that her eyes kept searching for something else.  
She left despite the daisies, the pleas, the screams, the violet blossoms on her wrists,  
/*Isn’t this enough? L*ose your f a i t h in m e./

He left the doors open,  
The lights on,  
The dogs asleep,  
And kept watch every night for a month.  
That should be when I learned to lull myself to sleep.

After days of standing in the doorway,  
He tried killing crickets with his own hands,  
Scaring the neighbors,  
And filling every pot in the kitchen with daisies.  
We started eating dinner at grandma’s.

I never saw the moment he stopped hoping—  
Maybe way back when the hunger that haunted him started chasing us,  
Maybe the gold mine spoke greed into him,  
Maybe he came to envy our goldfish for drowning himself (twice),  
Or maybe he couldn’t wipe away the wrath of the night  
When his hands crushed our mother like berries,  
White, purple, then black.  
But somewhere in-between,  
Our father started building with bottles and beer cans.  
He has been trying to kill himself ever since.

I woke up to him my whole life,  
Reaching for a bottle,  
At the dawn of the refrigerator light.  
Tumbling down the breakfast table,  
Passed out on the kitchen sink,  
On the bathroom tiles,  
At the family reunion,  
In the middle of the street at the Ritz,  
At the court toilet,  
Where he told me,  
“Lose your faith in me, Charlotte.”  
Then,  
Then, on my couch too,  
With his shoes on.

I remember my knuckles bruising, do you?  
From knocking on closed doors,

Outside bars, police stations, the ER, the daze,  
Bringing mail, newspapers, coffee,

Birthday cakes, doctors’ notices, the spring.  
His dogs slept on his doorway for months.  
/I’ve begged you to lose your faith in me./

Not sure when we stopped hoping—  
But one day, he drove himself as far away as he could,  
And I don’t think he ever really returned.  
I never thought that,  
Out of all the people,  
I would be the one  
To find him.  
/Too late./  
…Just on time.

But I don't recognize the red in his face.  
Is it the asphalt?  
The bottle?  
August?  
Guilt?  
It doesn’t matter anymore—  
It’s dripping down his temple.

1j7e9s2,https://i.redd.it/o66iadirkpne1.jpeg,How can Smart home transform our lives?,"How Can Smart Homes Transform Our Lives?

The rapid evolution of smart home technology is reshaping the way we live, offering convenience, security, and energy efficiency like never before. But how exactly do smart homes impact our daily lives, and what does the future hold for this innovative technology?  

1. Seamless Automation & Convenience
 
Smart homes integrate artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) to automate everyday tasks. From voice-activated assistants like Alexa and Google Home to smart thermostats that adjust temperatures automatically, these technologies enhance comfort and efficiency. Imagine waking up to your blinds opening gradually, your coffee machine brewing your favorite cup, and your smart mirror displaying the news—all without lifting a finger.  

2. Enhanced Security & Safety

Home security has advanced significantly with AI-powered surveillance cameras, smart locks, and motion sensors. These systems offer real-time alerts, facial recognition, and even predictive analytics to detect suspicious activities before they happen. Additionally, smart smoke detectors and leak sensors provide early warnings to prevent potential disasters.  

3. Energy Efficiency & Sustainability
 
Smart homes optimize energy usage, reducing waste and lowering utility bills. Smart lighting systems adjust brightness based on occupancy, while intelligent HVAC systems learn your habits and adjust accordingly. Solar panel integration and energy-monitoring devices further enhance sustainability, making homes more eco-friendly.  

4. Health & Well-Being 
With smart health-monitoring devices, homes can now track air quality, detect allergens, and even monitor vital signs. Smart beds adjust to improve sleep posture, and AI-powered fitness assistants help maintain exercise routines. These innovations contribute to healthier living environments.  

5. The Future of Smart Homes

As AI and 5G technology evolve, smart homes will become even more intuitive. We can expect hyper-personalized experiences, predictive automation, and seamless integration with urban smart grids. The future may also bring brain-computer interface technology, allowing users to control their home environment with mere thoughts.  

Smart homes are not just a luxury—they are a glimpse into the future of intelligent living. With enhanced automation, security, energy efficiency, and health benefits, these technologies are revolutionizing the way we interact with our living spaces. The question is: Are you ready to embrace the future of smart living?

But I am also aware that I have a bit of a blind eye on the art side and will not achieve the level of quality that is needed to survive on a highly competitive market. Due to real life responsibilities, I can invest roughly 15 hours a week into the project. So the next logical step is, to find developers with similar ambitions and create something bigger together!

This is the [Contract](https://karottenrambo.github.io/PocketPlanetNotes/Pocket%20Planet/PublishedPages/Revshare%20Contract.html) I'm planning to use and ofc I'm willing to discuss details.

This revenue share model is surely not everyone's cup of coffee, but it offers several advantages if you believe in me and the concept.

Who am i looking for? Here are the planned [development Milestones](https://karottenrambo.github.io/PocketPlanetNotes/Pocket%20Planet/PublishedPages/Development%20Milestones.html). At this point of development, (gameplay beta) I only need other unity developers. Experience with unity ECS/DOTS is pretty much a requirement, the learning curve is quite steep and it cannot be picked up within a weekend.

When the gameplay beta is ready, and some technical evaluations are done, I would also need and art director who can create low poly models and animations.

When the general setting/artstyle is set, other roles like video editor, marketing specialist would be open - but at this point, there will be an new post in INAT.

1j7e62x,https://www.reddit.com/r/ourtownreno/comments/1j7e62x/keep_reno_rad_a_chill_sunday_with_djs_at_midnight/,Keep Reno Rad: A Chill Sunday with DJs at Midnight Coffee Roasting,"Funky. Loungy. Jazzy. Organic. Soulful. The entire atmosphere of the calm but bustling Midnight Coffee Roasting is electrified with lo-fi jazz and techno house music on a chilled Sunday morning.

On March 2nd, the coffee bar hosted their first “coffee club” event spotlighting DJ house music collectives, Funk Facility and Fantasia Music. Five DJs from both collectives collabed together to bring Midtown’s Midnight Coffee Roasting a jazzy, funky ambiance from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. as casual coffee-goers enjoyed their breakfasts and drinks. 

As people weaved their way to 1401 S. Virginia St., the “loungy” tunes and afternoon low-tempo beats could be heard out of the large window of Midnight Coffee where the DJs set up their large speakers, low-hanging plants, laptops, portable turntables and DJ mixers. The long window and music set-up overlooked the outside rooftop and porch.

34-year-old graphic designer Christian Reichle arrived at the day party greeting friends, DJs and co-workers after ordering food and relishing in the groovy house atmosphere. Reichle is a part of the Biggest Little Tribe music organization (BLT), which prides itself in working with DJ collectives like Fantasia and Funk Facility to plan local house music events.

“We play all over the place like Lo Bar, Dead Ringer, which is our most common venue, and we helped at opening weekend for AleWorX and The Alpine,” Reichle said. “We are looking for more events like this – these day time events are fun because we get a different crowd and we get to expose ourselves and what we are to different people.” 

This event was one of the first venues for Funk Facility and Fantasia to really break away from common night time club culture. Reichle explained that house music is becoming increasingly popular for those outside of the DJ nighttime culture and that no matter what the time of day, people like to dance and they enjoy house music a lot more than they would think. Straying away from classic upbeat party music DJs spin during night time shows, this afternoon vibe called for more “chill, loungy energy” that allows people to enjoy their conversations, relax on the rooftop, but also gets people on their feet and grooving with the beat. 

Even the baristas crushing out drinks and food alike would bob their head to the beat or bounce on their toes throughout the early afternoon. The five DJs were taking turns spinning their tunes, and when they weren’t on the mixer, they were interacting and dancing with people coming in and out of the coffee bar. One DJ, Joelle Burkhardt, grooved to the house music wearing squared orange-tinted glasses with a striking salmon pink long sleeve and headphones that were worn over her large cheetah-print bucket hat. 

“This is the first kick-off event at Midnight,” Burkhardt said. “I love the earlier brunch vibe and I think people are ready for something different.” 

The energy within that small space was addictive. You couldn’t help but to jam along with the music and engage with the community through good cups of coffee. As the music played, more people started taking the stairs to the rooftop, ordering brunch and immersing themselves into the music. One of the biggest priorities for DJs is to keep the energy alive, and that could be taxing, especially within the afternoon music scene where it can be difficult to really gage what people are looking for. 

“When I choose tracks, it just comes to seeing the crows and figuring out what songs fit together the best,” 33-year-old DJ Tony Sandoval, the founder of Funk Facility, said. 

“You got to keep the flow going, have seamless transitions, and not try to disrupt the changes too much.” The goal for these brunch vibes is to find the “in-between of tech house and something more funky lo-fi. It’s a harder sell since you don’t know what people generally want.”

Sandoval founded Funk Facility around five years ago during COVID. He had always enjoyed the rave, DJ music scene in Southern California as a teenager and was determined to work in the professional setting of music mixing and show production in Reno.   


“I just wanted to bring disco house and punk music to Reno,” Sandoval said. “This funk disco house, it’s a facility of funk, but we are also facilitating the funk. If you look at the Funk Facility logo, it’s like two ‘Fs’ in a little building, or a facility.” 

For this collaboration, the two DJ organizations brought their differing genres together to create a three hour free performance, and they plan to continue the new event every week with Midnight Coffee. One of Fantasia’s DJs, Luke Cylke, wearing a neon-detailed jacket layered in bright greens and oranges, described the genres of the two collectives and how he organizes a set list for crowds. 

“I like to do 7 to 14 songs in an hour for a set,” Cylke said. “So about 20 to 30 songs on a setlist and I select from the list what the crowds would like, whether that’s low-tempo or party-like.” As for the genres, “Fantasia is a bit more organic, with live instruments like bongos. Funk Facility is funky, jazzy, with saxophone and piano riffs.”  


BLT also recently helped with the third annual Heart Beat of Reno Festival in the Brewery District, hosting 57 local DJs throughout an entire weekend with over 450 attendees. 

“It’s rewarding for us to be able to sell out a festival in town with just local talent, it’s very special,” Reichle said. “I love it and we like to throw a good party… our whole thing is to meet people, and I feel like this \[music scene\] is important to share.”

Will I seriously notice a difference between my bambino plus and Profitec Go/Move? i'm worried I'll get buyers remorse considering how much I like my Bambino. 

Should I pay £1000 more for a dual boiler on the Move? I only make one milk drink a day.

If I go with the Go, will I get annoyed over the fact it takes time to warm up and then takes another minute before steaming? Feels like a downgrade from the Bambino.

Anyone on here that got the Go and regretted not getting the Move? Saw someone use the phrase 'buy once, cry once' which seems to apply to this scenario!

What's the perfect affordable grinder to go with these? DF64 sounds like the most recommended. Are there any others that have a smaller footprint? c.£300

The dialogue is both hilariously bizarre (’This house was like 5,000% olive oil’) and unexpectedly profound. Worth the read if you enjoy smart satire about wealth, celebrity, and the performance of authenticity.” (I’m reposting this since I didn’t like the title of the original post. I wrote this on Friday night from a seed of an idea—and it made me laugh so hard I couldn’t resist sharing it with you all. I hope you guys find it funny!)

# WITH LOVE, MEGHAN: “A Pound of Olive Oil”

\[DRAMATIC NETFLIX LOGO.\]

\[FADE IN: A close-up shot of an overcast Montecito sky. An upbeat, old-timey song springs to life alongside a clearing; a tree stump; fluttering chickens; and a column of smoke rising from a campfire. “*A Netflix Series*” appears like the fine sear of a stamp of approval, reminding you of when times were better.\]

\[CUT TO: A fist swoops a blade into a rooster’s head.\]

MEGHAN (*wiping her brows*). “So even though I’m a pet owner, I can compartmentalize.”

The rooster’s wings flutter involuntarily. A hand tosses the head into a slop bucket.

MEGHAN. “The love we have for our pets; they’re all we have.” (*Laughs as she sets down her hatchet.*) “This one’s for dinner though.”

The upbeat music continues.

\[CUT TO: A close-up shot of “Archie’s Chick Inn,” designed not to remind you of the “Before Times” in *Chicken Run*.\]

MEGHAN (*voiceover*). “It’s not like, you know, what ‘problematic people’ would say about—right? You’d never see me doing this to a—”

\[CUT TO: The blade swoops down again.\]

\[CUT TO: MEGHAN’s eyes, filled with wonder.\]

\[CUT TO: A close-up of gardenias in the meadow.\]

MUSIC. “♫ *In your will—I see a soul so strong…*”

MEGHAN (*smiling, chatting with someone off-camera)*. “When you go into the coop, you can really feel—” (*eyes concentrated, scanning*) “—like a ‘thrum,’ almost, of something larger than yourself; you can really feel this sense of, ‘otherworldly connection’ almost, to some ‘shared pulse of life.’”

The music intensifies.

\[CUT TO: A young chick flaps its wings in the coop.\]

MEGHAN (*whispering*). “Like little fetal heartbeats all around.”

A shot of the forest. This episode isn’t playing around.

\[CUT TO: A close-up of Meghan’s eyes. They’re raw; frightened.\]

MEGHAN (*smiling*). “I mean, are we supposed to starve? Give up our tasties? Live as if we’re reduced? On a communist compound? We can’t even be pretty? All art is equal?” (*Looks up.*) “No.”

MUSIC. “♫ *Glory, She’s in your eyes…*”

\[CUT TO: MEGHAN’s interview next to the stump.\]

MICHAEL (*off-camera*). “What do you want for the world.”

MEGHAN. “Michael, it’s so funny you keep asking me that, and I’m just going to be so straightforward with you: I want everyone in the world to have what I have. And, honestly, ‘Michael’? If only you knew the ‘real story’? I’d want even better for you. My grandmother knew.”

The old-timey music continues, as the camera pans out to reveal MEGHAN in a leather bomber, a Western shirt, and blue jeans, clutching a hatchet, surveying a spread of decapitated chickens on a repurposed yoga mat.

MICHAEL (*off-camera*). “Love—”

MEGHAN (*smiling*). “—is a veneer for this.”

MICHAEL (*off-camera*). “And you’re sure.”

MEGHAN (*condescending*). “Oh I’m quite sure, Michael.”

MICHAEL (*off-camera*). “And you think that’s relatable.”

MEGHAN (*angry*). “Do I? Yes.”

\[CUT TO: A montage of MEGHAN and a film crew walking toward a Montecito farmhouse. MEGHAN’s hugging a slop bucket in both arms, laughing with the film crew.\]

MUSIC. “♫ *You came to me, like a duck in fright…*”

MEGHAN (*to someone off-camera*). “So my arch-nemesis Colson Lin is stopping by today, and I thought I’d make him an ‘honesty’ bomb.” (*Grinning.*) “How do socialists *really* feel about stainless-steel applicances?“

\[CUT TO: A Polaroid of an Asian kid in Houston.\]

MEGHAN (*sympathetically*). “Colson’s kitchen growing up, he says, was covered in vegetable oil residue and dead cockroaches.”

\[CUT TO: MEGHAN, in a gray sundress, twirling in slow-motion in a garden—a crisp blue sky, gold bracelets clinking—as dandelions float across a dress that allures like an address. This is *The White Lotus*.\]

MEGHAN (*voiceover*). “It’s okay to feel in awe of, natural reality. Trees. That there’s a shoreline. You can see the sky—it’s not, look, it’s not a ceiling like your apartment? All this grass; we’re on a cliffside. Sometimes clouds mist in, but we just—“ \[*blows*\] “—shoo them away. It’s okay; it’s not a big deal, some of us just enjoy nature. That doesn’t mean we’re out to hurt the cityfolk, right? We just like normalcy.”

\[CUT TO: A flash of lightning, rolling thunder in the distance.\]

>***WITH LOVE, MEGHAN***

\[CUT TO: *With Love, Meghan*’s title sequence: a 21st-century aristocrat harvesting strawberries, carving chickens, tilling the field. There’s a sense M’s weathered a storm, and it’s been overcome, but more is coming. (Colson was wrong about something, but was it the ‘moon bump’?) Lingering like a precision inside every frame: shots of the sky appear to show gray clouds hovering. A timeless wind entangles: whose wounds we’ll prick open, and what equalities remain; surreal parables, that’s all fiction amounts to.\]

\[CUT TO: MEGHAN approaches a Breville in the kitchen.\]

MEGHAN (*to someone off-camera*). “I just wanted a simple life. Do you want coffee? Are you not going to have some coffee?”

A kitchen this modern, with windows this open, can only mean one thing.

MICHAEL (*off-camera*). “Okay.”

MEGHAN (*giggling*). “I mean I couldn’t sleep last night; and not because.”

\[CUT TO: A close-up of a white countertop that you could spin freshly-peeled eggs on. Butter crinkles into oil in a stovetop pan.\]

MEGHAN (*frying bacon*). “You know that feeling; when you don’t know why but you just have a pit in your stomach, and it follows you around?”

In a Jackie O. dress, white, sleeveless, with a J. Crew striped white-and-beige cardigan wrapped around her shoulders, MEGHAN tosses chicken wings into a pan. The kitchen has a natural island backdropped by windows with a view of an atmospheric garden. The floor is black polished hardwood. There’s enough space between the island and the stovetop to dance in.

MEGHAN. “Bacon and eggs—that’s Colson’s thing. He’s all ‘classic Americana.’”

MICHAEL (*off-camera*). “Are you, are you nervous about…”

MEGHAN (*turns around*). “Hm? I’m fine.”

The camera pans across a clean, well-maintained Montecito kitchen.

MEGHAN (*to herself*). “If he wants to say I ‘smile’ too much, you can tell him it’s called having ‘manners’? We’re not here, right, just to smear our doom and gloom over everyone’s spreads like we can’t have nice bagels? We’re here to be ‘civil,’ do things by the book; rules exist for a reason.”

\[CUT TO: A sprinkle of salt into the pan.\]

MEGHAN (*raising a cup of espresso*). “Cheers.”

Smiling, MEGHAN knocks back a cup of brew with MICHAEL, who’s barely in the shot. As she sips, MEGHAN glances sideways with an ironic smile.

MEGHAN. “You know our beans, were extracted, by people we know?”

MICHAEL. “Get out of here!”

MEGHAN (*sipping from her cup*). “So one thing you’ll notice is—when I was growing up? We respected royalty; we respected dignity, refinement, elegance, and manners. That’s, you know—you just have to ‘see where the eyeballs are’? That’s—wisdom from the ancient moms: ‘The have-nots, as it turns out, aspired mainly to having.’ So, it’s not about—‘envy,’ right?”

MICHAEL. “You know, on Saturdays; we can think about that kind of stuff.”

MEGHAN. “Really? What do you—what do you, think about?”

UNIDENTIFIED VOICE. “Colson’s here.”

\[CUT TO: COLSON walks in, gray polo sweater, white shorts. It’s like being invited to the popular kid’s house as they’re having a downfall.\]

COLSON. “Hi. Thank you, for having me here.”

MEGHAN (*smiling, direct eye contact*). “You know, you’re so welcome?”

COLSON (*humble nod*). “Thank you.”

MEGHAN. “Well, have a seat anywhere!”

COLSON. “Thanks.”

MEGHAN. “Have you seen a nice kitchen like this before?”

COLSON. “Once or twice in my life.”

MEGHAN. “So I have a gift for you.”

\[CUT TO: A really well-done gift set is presented. Next to the kitchen island, COLSON’s twirling on a stool; MEGHAN’s behind a stove.\]

COLSON (*receiving it*). “Oh wow, thanks.”

MEGHAN (*making direct eye contact*). “I know you like ‘honesty,’ so I got you Honesty Bath Bombs; because you’re always in the bathtub!”

COLSON (*to himself*). “I’ll actually use these.”

MEGHAN. “Isn’t that great?”

COLSON. “Thank you!”

MEGHAN. “Don’t even mention it!”

COLSON (*still giddy*). “So I don’t know, what I could say, led there like a horse to water, that couldn’t be presented later without context, so I just want to YELL THAT UPFRONT.”

MEGHAN turns from the stove and laughs.

COLSON (*charismatically*). “Now it’s MUST-SEE TV.”

\[CUT TO: The crew applauds.\]

MEGHAN (*still laughing*). “So I think it’s great how you’re always talking about—how you think things are? I think it’s just really important to clarify at the outset: I’m not the first rich person you ever met.”

COLSON shakes his head.

MEGHAN. “And do you feel sort of like a—‘fish out of water’?”

COLSON. “Well, yeah.”

MEGHAN (*frowning, pointing in circles*). “We’re in one fish bowl, honey.”

COLSON. “I’m not really like, hierarchal—”

MEGHAN (*stares*). “I mean, what do think this is?”

COLSON. “Um.”

MEGHAN. “Your first job was Jamba Juice; wasn’t it?”

COLSON. “Yeah.”

MEGHAN. “So if we had worked together at Jamba Juice; you wouldn’t be happy for me?”

COLSON. “I mean—I’d be fine.”

\[CUT TO: A close-up of Thai chili chicken wings, bacon, and eggs in a pan.\]

MEGHAN (*turns around*). “Want some water? Oops; I already know you said no—I’m so sorry, I can’t help it!”

COLSON. “You’re good.”

MEGHAN. “It’s just; whenever I see someone who doesn’t have a refreshment—my mind goes haywire.”

COLSON. “What, are you doing?”

MEGHAN (*turns around, holding up a jar*). “Oh; they’re flower sprinkles! Have you ever put them on chicken wings before?”

COLSON. “No, never.”

MEGHAN. “What!”

COLSON. “That’s crazy.”

MEGHAN (*walking over to Colson*). “If you had kids, you’d get it!”

Leaning over the kitchen island, MEGHAN’s now holding a spoonful of flower sprinkles directly in front of COLSON’s mouth.

MEGHAN. “Here, you have to try this.”

COLSON (*after a pause*). “Um; okay?”

In one swift motion, COLSON gobbles up the flower sprinkles from MEGHAN’s spoon.

\[CUT TO: MEGHAN’s eyes widen as she smiles.\]

MEGHAN. “Isn’t that incredible!”

\[CUT TO: Olive oil streaming into a pan from the metal nub of a glass container.\]

MEGHAN. “A lot of how I approach, ‘decadence,’ right, is I compare it to ‘using olive oil when you’re not supposed to’?” (*Laughs.*) “I know it sounds ‘crazy,’ but I found that with so many recipes that always ‘sound so high-end on a menu,’ they can actually be replicated, at home—much more affordably, mind you—with just a little splash of olive oil! Right? I call it ‘that surprise splash of olive oil’? And so—if I’m picking out an outfit or I’m hired to do a floral arrangement for my kids, and I’m debating whether or not I really need that ‘one last accessory’? Right, I ask myself: is this like ‘splashing olive oil into Sabra to elevate game night’; or is it, even one step beyond that?”

COLSON. “Right. I mean, this house.”

MEGHAN. “Oh, Montecito was inspired by the Olive Garden—olive gardens; Italy—” \[*closes eyes*\] “—so you can actually—instead of vacations, I just walk outside. All the time.”

Her eyes fume.

COLSON. “Right. And did you—did you find yourself, having to splash ‘olive oil,’ onto an inferior situation to—”

MEGHAN. “Oh, to get this house? This house was like 5,000% olive oil.”

COLSON. “Right.”

MEGHAN. “Yeah, but we—do you not understand yet that if we didn’t live here, an oligarch would?”

COLSON. “I—I’m not from your world.”

MEGHAN. “This house—is—like a medina in an ancient tranquility.”

COLSON. “I mean they all are; on cooking shows.”

MEGHAN. “And I just thought, you know; if you can come from out of nowhere like I did, and have something nice—I mean, isn’t that just all of us?”

COLSON. “I don’t know, I really didn’t think about it that much.”

\[CUT TO: An egg timer goes off.\]

MEGHAN (*breaks out into laughter*). “Oh my gosh—the chicken’s ready!”

\[CUT TO: Two plates of chili-speckled chicken wings.\]

COLSON (*taking a bite*). “It’s, yeah.”

MEGHAN (*smiling intensely while making eye contact*). “Isn’t it good?”

COLSON (*putting a napkin to lips*). “Yeah, really good.”

MEGHAN. “So you’ve already been on my podcast.”

COLSON. “Right.”

MEGHAN. “And now you’re doin’ my lifestyle show.”

COLSON. “Right.”

MEGHAN. “But only in your head.”

COLSON (*puts down the napkin*). “Correct.”

\[CUT TO: MEGHAN pops open a champagne bottle.\]

MEGHAN. “So last night I couldn’t sleep, so I went on a juice-squeezing frenzy. See that jar of pineapple juice over there?” (*Points to the kitchen island, while walking to the refrigerator.*) “That’s just the beginning.”

MEGHAN opens up the fridge.

MEGHAN. “I literally have twenty centuries’ worth of pineapple juice.”

COLSON. “Whoa.”

MEGHAN shuts the fridge.

MEGHAN. “So we’re like a normal family, right? ‘Don’t believe everything you see on HBO.’ Colson; I have something else for you. Are you ready?”

COLSON. “Ready.”

MEGHAN (*spins around, holding a jar*). “I made some preserves for you!”

COLSON. “Thank you!”

MEGHAN (*laughing*). “And look, the lids—I painted them like little lifesavers.”

COLSON (*after a pause*). “Oh! Because I like the *Titani*c.”

\[CUT TO: A how-to segment’s title screen slides in: “*How to Be Considerate*.”\]

MEGHAN (*to someone off-camera*). “So a lot of things go into the concept of ‘tact,’ right—I feel like, you know, if I’m actually a thoughtful person, it’s sort of my responsibility to make sure everyone’s having a good time, right?”

\[CUT TO: A montage of B-rolls—pastel cakes, Thai chili flakes.\]

MEGHAN (*to someone off-camera*). “So many people, I think, have an idea of what rich people enjoy? And now that I’ve seen it for myself, I can tell you—we enjoy it when everybody shares our values. It’s kind of like—it’s kind of like *The Godfather*, right? You want to make sure nobody’s rockin’ the boat—so that’s where ‘tact’ comes in, it *separates*, it *sieves*, the ones who have tact, from, you know, those without. And at the end of the day; if you’re in God’s castle? You have to play by God’s rules of the game—and that’s sharing our values, about how to behave. And that’s being considerate.”

Doo-wop transition.

\[CUT TO: MEGHAN and COLSON conversing in the Montecito kitchen.\]

MEGHAN. “So; right? I’m just showing you—some of the things you’ll need; if you want to reach—” (*reaching for chili flakes*) “—the people here?”

COLSON. “Right.”

MEGHAN. “And rule number one: be considerate.”

COLSON. “I don’t speak rich people.”

MEGHAN. “No, no—the non-rich have to be considerate too.”

COLSON. “Right.”

\[CUT TO: A blender full of diced pineapples.\]

MEGHAN (*turning on the blender*). “We’re all, just trying—to co-exist.”

The blender whirls on.

MEGHAN. “Colson, have you ever felt ‘pushed to your limits’ before?”

COLSON. “All the time.”

MEGHAN. “Then you know what it feels like, if the stakes are high.”

COLSON. “Yeah.”

MEGHAN (*stops the blender*). “Do you want to go outside? And meet some of the chickens?”

\[CUT TO: A slow-pan across lucid blades of grass, dominated by fluttering dews of lavender; and COLSON and MEGHAN, walking barefoot across Montecito.\]

MEGHAN. “What are you trying to accomplish, Colson?”

COLSON. “Um, peace.”

MEGHAN. “Just ‘peace’?”

COLSON. “Just; an honest reckoning if ever more can be reckoned with. I don’t know. I feel like ‘reality’ got us to something ‘intense.’ And it’s rare? And it’s—there’s so much, inside of ‘care’? I guess, we—I don’t know.”

MEGHAN. “Take your time.”

COLSON. “I don’t know what anything is really; I feel like I’m just, both ‘formed by stimuli’ and constantly reacting to it at the same time you know?”

MEGHAN. “Like, you’re in the moment? Right, I’m following.”

COLSON. “I think ‘care’s’ probably really like, foundational and sacred; like it’s something that both can come naturally and can be nurtured? And I feel like, in some ways, it’s been decayed for us; like, there are ways to sort of, both, sustain the image of caring, while emptyin’ its depth…”

MEGHAN. “Care is sacred.”

COLSON. “Right, and—maybe like, it’s decaying in a way? Like care is hollowing out from the inside…?”

MEGHAN (*opening the chicken coop*). “Like the shell of care’s still there.”

COLSON. “Right, but in a way that’s like, you know—”

MEGHAN (*entering the coop, calling over the hens*). “We all care about different things, so what are we going to do about that?” (*looks up*) “You can’t just, like—stare into the core of caring and pretend like it’s yours.”

COLSON. “But it can’t be all about ‘what you feel in the moment’ either, because that shifts so variably over the course of stimuli; unreliably.”

MEGHAN (*gazing at a hen*). “I mean—do they, though? Aren’t you undervaluing how much ‘intuition’ can take over and do all the work?”

COLSON. “You mean.”

MEGHAN (*smiling at a hen*). “Sometimes you just have a ‘sense,’ right, of what you care about; and what you don’t? What feels right?”

COLSON. “You mean intuition.”

MEGHAN. “I mean intuition! You follow what you feel, and if what you feel leads you to, feeling attached—”

COLSON. “We have to know if anything can be sacred; and if it can, we have to know what they are and how our access might decay. I don’t know. It’s actually the nature of love, the core of love—‘care.’ But like—the kind that can truly empty you, you know? I mean. There’s just something, right, that can charge the air with your inner shivers; and it’s sacred. Intense. Rare?”

MEGHAN. “What’s—what’d be a graceful way of treating rarity?”

COLSON. “I don’t know, sensing it? Letting yourself ‘feel’ it? Or just remembering it, too. Knowing how small you are at the feet of heights. That feeling, ‘fear’—it accompanies your sense of, I don’t know… I don’t know. Just ‘the real world,’ I guess; the sense that who you love, can sink, here; or that they’ve been sinkin’ from the start. Like our psyches weren’t rigged for this ‘background radiation,’ maybe, painting what things can feel like.”

MEGHAN (*making faces at a hen*). “But we all share fear.”

COLSON. “We all share fears in common, right, like so much of history was rhythmed by that—some ancient core of ‘care’; plus all of our rhyming fears.”

MEGHAN. “So I mean, what does that—where do you go with that.”

COLSON. “I think ‘hope can sustain the difference’?”

MEGHAN. “You think ‘hope’ can ‘sustain’ the ‘difference.’ What—like, if you experience ‘hope’ instead of ‘fear’; you’ll make better decisions?”

COLSON. “Not necessarily. I just think; sort of, like—even gettin’ this far, you know, like the lights turn on, things just sorted out, maybe. I don’t know.”

MEGHAN. “Do you think humanity gets any better with nobody’s help?”

COLSON. “Or we can just, ‘see authenticity as sacred’?”

MEGHAN. “And that’s all of us all the time, isn’t it?”

COLSON. “I s’pose so.”

\[CUT TO: Thunder rumbles into the chicken coop. It’s overcast now. A dull gust stripes MEGHAN’s hair across her face.\]

COLSON. “We share this, I guess, ‘experience of being alive,’ with anyone who shares it, you know?”

MEGHAN. “Right, we share a ‘first-person experience’…”

COLSON. “I just feel like, if ‘sacred values’ exist, maybe, nurturin’ them while we still can, can maybe prepare us better, for more grown-up challenges…”

The hen starts rapidly flailing in MEGHAN’s arms.

COLSON. “And ‘good timing’—wishin’ for that, maybe. Not consciously. Hoping it exists, teleologically, transcendently, I don’t know. It could help us—hold on to hope.”

COLSON (*drinking tea*). “Mm-hmm.”

MEGHAN. “And so you go to school; you do, ‘after-school activities,’ you participate in tests and exams; you’re trained, you know, to succeed.”

COLSON. “Right, by your ‘culture.’”

MEGHAN. “Right; and then by whatever social atmosphere surrounds you—and whatever you happen to feel, right, in your moment-to-moment life?”

COLSON. “Sculpting our intuitions.”

MEGHAN. “Our intuitions, right? Like just your basic cares.”

COLSON. “Plus everything we’re indifferent about.”

MEGHAN. “And that’s everyone!”

COLSON. “So by the time you’re put to work.”

MEGHAN (*claps hands*). “Right, by the system—job-hunting, auditioning, kissin’ ass to anyone who can help you, it’s all the same thing—you either end up exactly where you ought to be; or you become disaffected.”

COLSON. “And that’s when you—”

MEGHAN. “‘Disassociate.’ You’re just winning points for your family at that point.”

COLSON. “Which is what everyone’s doing.”

MEGHAN. “Exactly—your children are your heirs! We inherited everything we didn’t marry into by working hard and contributing to a machine that’s flooded with capital. And it started with—right; education? And it ends with.”

COLSON. “Right.”

MEGHAN. “More education!”

COLSON. “Right.”

\[CUT TO: A bird’s-eye-view of scones, encircled by tea cups.\]

MEGHAN. “So I’m a mom, right? And what I really want is for my children to have what we inherited—our ‘conveniences,’ right? Our sense that; even if there’s a rainstorm out there, at least in here, there’s reliable shelter? We weren’t born into nightfall; forced to navigate foreign human psyches in the darkness. We were—we hopped into ‘clothes’ that were already here; into homes that were already there; drove on roads that were already paved.”

COLSON. “Well, I paved my own path through the internet.”

MEGHAN. “Right, and so what? So would Socrates; or anyone with wi-fi.”

COLSON. “When I was a child, it was intuitive to share with the least of us. That’s how I felt, and I’m glad. I’m glad.”

MEGHAN. “But where do you draw the line, Colson?”

COLSON. “I don’t know. Space-time?”

MEGHAN (*laughing*). “Or, we can just share with our most vaunted peers.”

COLSON. “‘Every tribe for itself’ is an energy in the air.”

MEGHAN. “We’re scared as fuck, Colson.”

COLSON. “I just feel like fear, distrust, hierarchy—I don’t know, plus it’s a recognizable dystopia? Maybe ‘before self-recognition,’ or it was all a haze.”

MEGHAN. “Hey—eyes down here, helicopter. What’s your solution here?”

COLSON. “I don’t know: ‘Sacred is the essence of sharing’?”

MEGHAN. “Like there’s something ‘sacred’ about the ‘essence of sharing’?”

COLSON. “Right—which connects to everything?”

MEGHAN. “But everyone who’s rich gets to stay rich through dynasty lineages.”

COLSON. “Right. For what?”

MEGHAN. “For what we’re handing down.”

COLSON. “Right. Just as—”

MEGHAN. “So as you know, even people you don’t think are good, can be good. Wrapped underneath centuries and centuries of bad directions; new directions; good directions; and misdirections, there’s sometimes reason? Patience? I love the translucence of patience; it’s like a clarity, as you wait for a garden to grow. It’s not the impatient we despise; it’s the impatience.”

COLSON. “Mm.”

MEGHAN. “I’ve always just loved, taking something like love—and elevating it?”

COLSON. “Love is always in the air.”

MEGHAN. “It’s like in every TV show, right, and every book; every movie, every cultural artifact? Sex! Money! And right below that? ‘Love!’”

COLSON. “Plus political commentary.”

MEGHAN. “Right—and so do you think, Colson, when future civilizations examine America; be they ‘alien’ or ‘human’ or ‘AI’; they might…”

COLSON. “They’d probably figure out ‘care’ undergirds ‘reason itself’; like ‘reason’ carried our self-understanding, but there’s like—trust, care, and depth, right? ‘Gratitude for all we ever felt love for’? Or sheltered by trust, or nurtured by care? Or just the lights turning on? I don’t know.”

MEGHAN. “So you’re saying—we have a lot ‘dysfunctions,’ and maybe we haven’t always given each other enough ‘reasons’ to be grateful for each other’s presence?”

COLSON. “I mean, you try lookin’ for reasons to be grateful for everyone reality spits out at you.”

MEGHAN. “But like—if we auto-pilot our lives, on an image of ‘*depth*’…”

COLSON. “We could collapse hopes inside and out, the world over.”

MEGHAN (*taken aback*). “Oh my goodness, so it’s like a constant struggle, right? A constant ‘tension’—landing on a relationship’s stable ‘meaning’ is sort of like—” (*looks up from the baking tray and laughs*) “—knowing when to finish sprinklin’ flower petals over cookies.”

COLSON. “It’s like an intuition, I guess!”

MEGHAN (*still laughing, holding up a tray of cookies*). “Do you think that’s quite enough?”

COLSON (*laughing*). “Holy shit.”

MEGHAN. “Do you think I overdid it with the petals?”

A previous post landed on the suggestion of BM Swiss Coffee, but I think I’d like something with even warmer undertones. Any recommendations?

Thanks in advance!

Extras:

1. It was also previously suggested that I paint my kitchen cabinets after painting the walls to avoid the huge excess of white. I’m completely game for this idea, so bonus points if you have a suggestion for cabinet paint color too. My appliances will all soon be stainless/black in color to match the micro & range.

2. I’ve essentially gotten rid of all my furniture so I can buy new to match the floors and walls once complete too. I’m not great with a blank canvas so if you have thoughts on a color palette to aim for for furniture (dining table, couch, media stand) that’d be huge as well!

Basically I’m open to input on how to design my entire place at this point🥲. So any and all ideas are welcome haha. Again, many thanks in advance.

If you are reading this at midnight go to sleep and read this post afte ryour History exam 

I passed ICSE last year,am currently in CBSE 11th

I almost didn't study the whole year but studied the night before exam till 3a.m and woke up at 9,btw I used to enter school at 10:40 ,those they used to tell to enter at 10 and everyone was seated at the hall by 10:25(school is 5mins away)

My actual score in History should have been around 75 including internals but it was 93 in marksheet,a guy who literally got 28 in maths preboard got 98 in ICSE he used to literally insult and joke with the maths teacher I rotn think he can even tell the formula of A P. it you ask him he got 93% in ICSE,don't destroy your health on this basis of your preboards score was around 75-85 you will have minimum 90-95 in ICSE assuming your school makes papers just a little hard but the increment can be even by 20% if your school made really hard papers and did strict checking,also don't be sad incase your exam doesn't go well or your ICSE percentage is not as good as expected I have seen the result and honestly concluded that upto 90-93 and maybe 96
is in your hands,rest is all on your fate,and the teacher who checks your answersheet,I should have got 95 in geography but ended up getting 83 I assume probably my map got detached and went with a recheck but marks didn't increase.

So make sure to keep your answersheet neat and clean and presentable and maybe first answer using the keywords and then you can stretch the answer if you feel so I doubt if these invigilators even read the answersheet 

Also cut to today why I am telling this-

My 11th finals ended on 8th March yesterday, majority of the days I was awake till 3:30 and woke at 6 ,also before my exams I had practicals and I pulled all nighters on those nights and drank coffee before showing to school,

And now all of a sudden I have gotten diarrhea and acidity,even in 10th I was awake till 4:47a.m(yes I remember this because I was literally flexing to my friends my messaging them at dawn to show my capabilities) to finish my English project woke at 6:40 and went to school on 28th August 2023 (probably Monday as per my memory) and I was print my computer project till 3:45am and woke at 6:15  and those days I felt hella tired even during my 11th finals on 2 days on exam I had to go to washroom and put water in my eyes else I was constantly closing my eyes,I am currently taking melatonin supplements to fix my sleep cycle .

At first all nighters might seem cool ,but if you keep doing it you won't feel sleepy at night and your daytime will be filled with drowsiness and then your will start experiencing health problems like me ,study during daytime regularly don't try to force everything line of book in your brain the night before exam, chat with your partner for hours ,enjoy binging shows but after ICSE no one is gonna stop you then ,for now balance study and chat and enjoy but little,set your priorities right.",8,1741544545.0,ICSE,10,0.91,False

Is there some specific Mugs and Gran Lungo capsules I should buy or are the bundles cheaper to buy? Can someone give me some light to this? or just buy what i like individually?

I'm generally a healthy woman. I quit drinking alcohol completely 1.5 years ago (just to be healthy, I was sober-curious, no issues with alcoholism). I don't smoke or vape (anything at all), no drugs. I tried things when I was in college but I'm all squeaky clean for years now, never had substance abuse issues. I exercise 2 to 5 times per week, mostly Peloton bike, yoga, and pilates. I am allergic to Gluten (likely celiac, it runs in my family, but the gluten problems started just a few years back), so I'm GF. I try to eat mostly whole foods and limit processed junk. I think I do alright. I don't take any medications or birth control at all. I do like to take melatonin gummies before bed, but that's the only supplement I take. I'm in the US. 

My primary complaint has to do with my menstrual cycle. Since I first started my period (14 years ago) I've had severe period cramps that seem to be contractions (they surge and then lessen, and repeat). They are extraordinarily uncomfortable and prohibit me from going about my daily life. This lasts for a number of hours when my period first starts and then things get better, but I'm violently sick for the first 1-2 days of my period. 

Anything in my stomach comes back up, and anything that has already passed through my stomach comes out the other end. My entire system purges until I'm empty. The cramping and contracting is so painful. 

This is accompanied by headaches and sensitivity to light, so I have to sit in the dark and silence. I also get shakes, mostly in my legs. My body gets feverish, very sweaty but I'm freezing and shivering. I cannot keep anything down during this time, even sips of water and any sort of pain relief or fever reducer just aggravates my stomach and comes back up. 

I have never been pregnant or had children (no miscarriages, abortions, nothing). I've being living with this for 14 years and I'm at my wits end with it. PCPs and gynecologists offer me birth control and it frustrates me, I feel like they're not taking me seriously. I want to understand why this is happening to me, I want to know what can be done aside from birth control. I keep getting shrugged off by doctors. This is disrupting my life. I'm getting very desperate for help. I know there are different things it could be. 

For remedies I drink chamomile tea when I can keep it down, I use a heating pad. I eat high fiber foods during my luteal phase. I use reusable pads (they're just fabric inserts that button in my underwear) to make sure I'm not introducing any chemicals into my system through pads or tampons. I take care of myself all month, year-round. I'm in good health and I'm perfectly happy and wonderful for the other 28 days of the month, hence my not wanting birth control. My only ""unhealthy"" habits are my daily cup of coffee and the occasional gluten free dessert, which I eat in moderation. Treats are usually scratch baked with whole ingredients. 

When I was in high school I was on the progesterone-only ""mini pill"" for about two years and it was miserable. They didn't want to prescribe me the pill with estrogen because I have some migraine history. I felt much better when I got off of it. I'm getting married this year and I eventually will want to get pregnant, although not right now. But this issue is impacting my ability to go to work and it's breaking my heart. I take such good care of myself and this is starting to feel so unfair. Every month I have high hopes that maybe all my healthy habits will result in a normal period and every month I'm so disappointed. 

If anyone can provide some sort of reassurance or guidance it would mean so much to me. Thank you. ",1,1741544220.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

### **The Last Letter**
  
It starts with a man named **Dr. Adrian Bellamy**, sitting in a hospital waiting room, scribbling notes in a worn-out leather journal. The pages are filled with what seems to be *utter gibberish*—numbers, symbols, disjointed sentences.  

- **“The orange cat knows.”**  
- **“Seven steps. Left foot first.”**  
- **“Why does coffee taste like salt today?”**  
- **“She won’t recognize me at first, but she must.”**  

As he waits, a nurse calls out: *""Mr. Lewis?""*  

Dr. Bellamy doesn’t respond. But the old man next to him, who has been staring blankly at the floor, **suddenly gasps**, grabs Adrian’s hand, and whispers: *""It's you.""*  

Confused, Adrian pulls away. The old man **collapses, unconscious**. The nurses rush in.  

The scene **shifts** abruptly.

A bright orange cat jumps onto the counter. Elise suddenly **remembers something**, but **what?**  

#### 2. **A Man Running Down an Alleyway**
Somewhere across the city, a man in a torn coat, **David**, is sprinting through an alley. He’s being chased by a **shadow with no face**.  

He turns a corner and sees an old payphone. It starts ringing.  
Panting, he picks it up.  

A voice on the other end—his own voice—whispers:  
**“Seven steps. Left foot first. Don't get it wrong.”**  

David hesitates, steps forward—  
And the shadow **devours him.**  

#### 3. **A Child’s Drawing**
A little girl sits on the floor, furiously drawing a picture with **red, orange, and blue crayons**. She hands it to her father.  

""It's a letter!"" she says.  

He frowns. ""Sweetie, this is just scribbles.""  

""No, Daddy, it's a letter. But it's **from the end**.""  

---

### **The Ending – The Perspective Shift**  

Dr. Adrian Bellamy is not a doctor. Not anymore.  
He is a **dying man, trapped in time, reliving the same moments over and over**, trying to fix something.  

- **Elise** is his wife. But she doesn’t remember him—**because she hasn’t met him yet.**  
- **David** is his past self. The alley, the shadow—it wasn’t a dream. He was **killed before he was supposed to die**.  
- **The little girl’s drawing?** It wasn’t a picture. It was a **warning**.  

Adrian finally **remembers everything**. The pieces lock into place.  

He died **before he could send one last letter** to Elise. A letter that would have **prevented all of this**. The orange cat, the café, the phone call—he had left these **clues for himself** in past loops.  

But now, **he knows the ending**.  

He takes out his journal. Writes one final message.  

Then, everything **blinks out**.  

---

### **Rereading the Story – What You Realize**
- The **salt in the coffee** wasn’t random. Elise was tasting something familiar—**Adrian's memory leaking into her reality.**  
- **David’s chase?** That was Adrian’s *past self*, running from death itself. The phone call was **his own voice** trying to save himself.  
- The **orange cat** appeared when something important was about to happen.  
- The **little girl’s “letter”** wasn’t a drawing. It was a **time loop artifact**, Adrian’s last warning to himself.  
- **Seven steps, left foot first**—A specific moment in time **had to be repeated exactly** to prevent Adrian's early death.  

Everything was nonsense—**until you knew the ending.**

# Linda the mom on a mission 

*Bird's-eye view of Linda in bed.*

*The clock goes off.*

**Linda:** GOD DAMMIT, WE'RE LATE!

**Linda:** Lukas, give me your sister!

*Linda picks up the child and gently puts them in the car (she throws the kid in).*

**Linda:** *Seeing her other kid stare at her* WHAT?! WE'RE LEAVING IN THREE SECONDS, GRAB YOUR IPAD!

*We see Linda running out the door.*

*Linda opens the door, and we see Donna.*

**Donna:** Well, hello there, Linda!

**Linda** *(in a bad mood but trying to keep her cool):* Hello, Donna. How are you?

**Donna:** Wow, look at you. Out of the house before noon and with your kids in one piece and not a glass in your hand. Must be a special occasion. Is it a Harris rally? *(starts hawking Trump)*

**Linda:** Well, look at your kid, you Republican.

*We see Donna’s kid, Jimmy, eating mud like it’s a snack.*

**Donna:** JIMMY, GET OUT OF THE MUD RIGHT NOW. GOD, YOU DISAPPOINTMENT.

*While Donna is yelling at Jimmy, Linda talks to the camera.*

**Linda:** Lukas, can you grab Mama's secret toy for me?

*We see Lukas grab a frying pan from the kitchen.*

**Linda:** Thanks, baby. COME HERE, GIRL!

*From Lukas' POV, we see Linda hit Donna with the frying pan. They fight for a few seconds.*

**Linda:** That’ll show you. You wanna be Dolly Parton? LET’S GO!

*If possible, Linda jumps into the car through the window.*

**Linda:** GET READY TO GO THROUGH TIME!

**Grandma** *(in an old voice):* Linda… is that you?

**Linda:** GRANDMA! What are you doing here?

**Grandma:** I’ve been here since last Sunday.

**Linda** *(cutting off Grandma):* Oh, that's nice. Look, there’s that emo poser I’ve been telling you about.

*Out of the car window, we see a kid who* 

**Shadow:** I'm not EMO… I'm *literally* goth. No one understands me.

*We hear Shadow’s mom call out to them.*

**Shadow’s Mom:** Sweetie, come here!

**Shadow:** UGH, NOT NOW, MOM. I'M *LITERALLY* TRYING TO GET MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE BACK TOGETHER.





**Interview with Shadow:**

**Shadow:** You know the phrase, ""One man's trash is another man's treasure""? It’s a wonderful saying, but a horrible way to find out you were adopted. That’s me. I was adopted and found out on the Kamala Harris show. *(Kamala Harris scene plays)* Yeah, after Kamala Harris lost the presidency to Donald Trump, she became a TV host and did DNA and lie detector tests.

*\*We see a show that’s kind of like the Maury Show\**

**Kamala:** In the case of Shadow… Cindy, you are not the coconut tree.

*We see Shadow run off crying.*

**Kamala:** Hey, hey, hey, it’s okay. Relax. Your real parents will come back… eventually.





**Interview with Shadow’s Mom:**

**Shadow's Mom:** You know, I really can't stand this emo thing anymore. I hope it's just a phase. *(Shadow’s line)* She wonders why she’s like Nemo. It’s because both of them can’t seem to find their dad.

*Shadow overhears this.*

**Shadow:** IT'S NOT A PHASE, MOM! THIS IS ME.

*Shadow is cut off by Ms. Courtney, who has a phone in her hand like she’s filming a vlog.*

**Ms. Courtney** *(in a stereotypical white girl voice):* Ugh, move, poser.

**Shadow:** I'M GOTHHH, …*(starts sobbing like a baby).* I swear, if I hear another “it’s just a phase” comment, I’ll drown myself in my own eyeliner. 

**Ms. Courtney** *(running):* Ugh, some people just need to stop being emo. Anyway, my husband left a note on the fridge that said, “This isn’t working.” I’m not sure what he meant. I opened the fridge, and it’s working fine! I haven’t seen him in a week, but that’s a different problem.





*We see Grandma still stuck in the car, looking around.*

**Grandma:** HELP MEE. MY REGRET OF A DAUGHTER LEFT ME IN HERE LIKE MY DAD DID.

**Ms. Courtney:** Oh my god, are you stuck in the car?

**Grandma:** Yes, and I asked Siri, “Why am I still single?” It activated the front camera and took a photo. What should I do?

**Ms. Courtney:** Oh my god, oh my god, I’m going to look for help!

**Grandma:** I'M STILL HERE!

**Ms. Courtney:** It’s a hot day, she’ll get heatstroke soon anyway.





*From Lukas’ POV, we see Ms. Courtney walking down the street.*

*As they’re fighting, Lukas runs off and bumps into Kidnapper #1.*

**Kidnapper #1** *(in an old and rusty voice):* Well, hey there, little guy. You want some candy?

*Lukas shakes his head yes and gets into the back of the van.*

**Kidnapper #1:** HAHA! YOU’VE BEEN KIDNAPPED. If you scream, no one will hear you!

**Kid:** Buddy, I’ve been raising my hand in class for years. I know the feeling.

**Kidnapper #1:** GOD, JUST GET HER ON THE PHONE!

**Kidnapper #2:** She’s on the phone now.



**Linda:** *(phone rings)* Mom speaking.

**Kidnapper:** We have your kid.

**Linda:** Okay, what do you want me to do about it?

**Kidnapper:** ...What? This isn’t a flea market.

**Parents:** Fine. $25, final offer.

**Kidnapper:** Ma’am, this is your CHILD.

**Kid** *(leaning into the phone, deadpan):* Honestly, I’d take the deal. Gas is more expensive than therapy these days.

**Linda** *(casually from the background):* Look, she’s a mess. She's like the human version of *Euphoria*—a disaster in every possible way.

**Kid** *(snorts):* First off, I’m the Rue of this family. And second, you’re the one who let me watch that show.

**Kidnapper #2** *(whispering to Kidnapper #1):* Are we sure we want to keep her?

**Kidnapper #1** *(gritting teeth):* We’re in too deep now.

**Linda** *(yelling from the background):* I’m just trying to survive the week, okay? Without crying to “Chained to the Rhythm.” And also, what money? My kid spends it all on overpriced hoodies and iced coffee. God, I hate Gen Z.

**Kid** *(yelling from the background):* NOT TRUE! I steal some of it!

**Kidnapper #2** *(whispering):* …I think we picked the wrong one.

**Kidnapper #1:** YOU THINK?!

**Linda:** Look, you either keep her or bring her back—your choice.

*(Silence on the other end.)*

**Kidnapper #1** *(panicking):* …We’re bringing her back.

**Linda:** That’s what I thought.",1,1741543980.0,ReadMyScript,12,1.0,False

I had high hopes for Apple Intelligence to bring all of this info to Siri, but at some point I got tired of waiting. Funnily enough, I just launched it last week 😀

Daybrief generates a **personalized, spoken daily recap** including your **calendar events, reminders, weather, and more**. It’s designed for people who want a hands-free start to the day, whether you’re making coffee, commuting, or just waking up.

You tell it which calendars you'd like to monitor, which Reminders lists, and when you'd like to get your personalized podcast. You can add shared calendars and reminders too, so you get a quick rundown of your and your partner’s day ahead. Generated by advanced AI, encrypted, and delivered directly to you, making sure only your phone can listen to it. And it includes shortened free briefings if you just want to try it out.

Would love to hear your thoughts—what else would you want in a daily briefing? I’m already testing some cool options, like delivering a briefing in a language you’re trying to learn, or some cool personalities for the voice of your EA 😀",0,1741543955.0,apple,3,0.31,False

My boyfriend and I are planning on spending a weekend in Ljubljana at the end of the month. 

We would love some recommendations of places to eat (read about the asian hot pot place, is it any good?), patisseries, museums and other places that you think are a must see for first time Ljubljana visitors.

My boyfriend is somewhat of a coffee fiend so if you have a favourite specialty coffee place, please let me know in the comments.

We were also thinking of visiting Bled. Is it better to take a bus or to go by train?
