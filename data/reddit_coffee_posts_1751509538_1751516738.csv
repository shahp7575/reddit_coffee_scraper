1) no harsh cardamom opening anymore: earlier the cardamom was so strong, my throat used to clench while spraying it, now it has smoothened considerably.

2) Projection has improved not longevity: it used to project for 1½ hours before, now it does project around 3 hrs... Longevity is the same, maybe slightly better, stays on for 7 hours.

1lqgdnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lqgdnk/multidating_dilemma/,Multi-Dating Dilemma!,"Hi! 
So I decided to get onto a Christian dating app to meet guys who are of the same faith as me. 
It’s been going well and I met a guy I really connected with. We’re from the same home town and know a lot of the same people. After texting for a while and speaking on the phone a few times we set up a date. The date went really really well and we ended up sitting at the cafe and talking for over 4 hours. 
He’s incredibly sweet and kind, he’s attentive and patient and I admit I do like him. 

After our date, that afternoon a different guy who I had also been messaging on the dating app asked me on a date. Then on that same day, I matched with a third guy who’s profile caught my attention (we have a lot in common and he’s also pretty attractive) 

Guy number 1 is very invested in us getting to know each other and has already told his family about us meeting, getting along so well and having an awesome date. 
Guy number 2 seems really nice and I’m interested in meeting him. 
Guys number 3 and I have been getting along extremely well. We have such great conversations, he’s intelligent and insightful, and ticks so many boxes for me. We seem to have great chemistry and banter and he’s been amazing. 

The problem I have now is that guy #1 is very invested after just 1 date (he’s not dated much and I’m one of the first girls he’s taken interest in in years) and I don’t even know how or even if I should tell him I’m multi dating. 
 
Guy #3 has really caught my attention and I’m really excited for our upcoming date and to see if the connection over the phone is the same in person. 
If this goes well I think he would be the person I would want to pursue something more with. 
But I can’t say for sure until we meet in person. 

I’m having a hard time figuring out what to do about guy #1. I don’t want to hurt his feelings and disappoint him. But I also feel like he deserves the respect of knowing where I stand.
He is amazing and I can see us having a future together. 

Guy #2 is very mysterious and intriguing. He’s a bit of an outlier but he’s been kind and I’d like to go through with the date (we’re just grabbing ice cream) 

I guess I want to go on the other two dates and see if there’s anything there. But I don’t want it to be like guy #1 is just an option or that if I do choose to pursue a relationship with him, that he’s a second choice. 

I’m trying to do the right thing, and would love any advice. Please let me know if you think I’m doing the wrong thing or being an awful person, because I really want to do the right thing in this situation. 

Note: I have some strict rules for myself with these dates. I’m only going one 1 date with guy # 2 and #3 before making a choice so I don’t drag this out for too long and allow for deep feeling to develop before I’ve made a decision. 
I have a no kiss rule, hugs and hand holding only. I don’t want anyone to get too involved and I feel like sometimes physical things (even kissing) can cloud judgement. 
And finally I’m opting for low investment dates, coffees, icecream, going on walks, etc. ",1,1751516349.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I would like to purchase the Lelit Mara X PL62X from Coupang (Korean Amazon), and I have a few questions, especially for those who are more electrically minded.

⸻

1) Background:
I messaged the seller, and he says he imports the Italian-made machine (sold through a mall/distributor in Germany) to Korea. FYI, I cannot seem to find a version officially sold by a Korean distributor or manufacturer to save my life.

⸻

2) Power standards:
	•	Germany uses 230V power at 50Hz.
	•	Korea uses 220V power at 60Hz.
	•	Both countries use very similar plugs (Type C & Type F), so the plug itself should physically fit Korean outlets.

⸻

3) My concerns:
I’m mainly worried about whether this frequency and voltage difference will damage the pump or any other aspects of the machine. Will the vibration pump run too fast or wear out quickly because of the 60Hz frequency? Or will I risk harming the machine by using it in Korea?",1,1751516129.0,Lelit,0,1.0,False

Wondering with AI and tools available today without cutting any corners because I’m sure making the right industry contacts plays a pivotal role here, is there a particular strategy, or set of actions needed to be taken in a particular order to take a small-batch dessert recipe and transform it to something like the Bobos Brand for instance, and mass produce for retail distribution eventually landing in one of the big US retailers? The reason I mention this brand specifically is that aesthetically it’s similar to our chocolate product (quirky brand, top notch very niche tasty product, gluten-free, non-GMO, vegan).

Is the move e-commerce instead, like these guys?

so one contract company had a thing about needing excessive paperwork for their guys who were sick. see, the medical care was a line item in the client company budget - so nobody saw a bill. this made for a system that was easily abused, what with no financial dog in the fight. 

so this one company's guys would come in periodically, appropriately sick. they weren't burning time, they only made money on duty, so they wanted to work. we'd see them, and often give a day or two of bed rest before returning to work; everyone there was typically on a 2 week tour of duty due to logistics, so a day or two like this wasn't uncommon or unreasonable. patient would be seen, given a note for the boss, go get some rest and take your meds. 

but that wasn't good enough. maybe for every OTHER contractor, but nnnooOOOOoooo, this contractor was SPECIAL. 

so even though they'd been seen by qualified medical staff, and given prescriptions and a note on when they could return to work, this company wanted them evaluated AGAIN and ANOTHER note saying they could actually go back on duty, even if was 12-24 hours since the first visit. remember - no cost, so what do they care; right?

this didn't sit well with us.  we had long hours and busy days, often 18-24hrs awake and on duty (with a two week tour of duty), and this was BS paperwork and time wasting because someone felt like it - not because it was medically necessary. if we've seen the patient and given you a note on when they can go back on duty, my due diligence was done. 

so we decided, after a couple of months of this pattern, to accommodate them. on our terms. 

guys would come in, ready and willing to go back to work, but still needing another note, because apparently the first one wasn't nearly good enough and the boss said so. so they'd get one, on our terms. after we'd see all of the morning sick call patients. after our scheduled morning appointments.  they'd be on the clock until we saw them again, sitting in our waiting room, on the clock and drinking coffee.....which was typically around 3 hours after the clinic opened.  each and every one of them, which was typically 2-3 guys, every day (they were a big contractor).  

they were surprisingly slow to pick up on it. took about a month of this approach.  and once they put it all together they were PISSED. clearly we were wasting THEIR time, and ours?  wtf did that matter, we were on duty and the care was free so fuck our opinion. 

but our bosses backed us 100% - essentially saying ""if you went to your doctor and paid for a visit, would you pay again to be told the same thing the next day?""

after that, the paperwork from the medical staff was honored the first time, and everyone's work days were more efficient. ",10,1751515726.0,MaliciousCompliance,1,0.86,False

A year ago I was pushing 290 lbs and got on a GLP-1. I don’t know if I associate my energy levels with that weight loss journey or not, but for the last year or so I been lacking major energy. I wake up tired because I have to and because I know I won’t be getting any more/better sleep just laying there awake. I have real painful esophageal reflux issues that caused my last ENT to say “I can literally see chemical burns on your vocal chords”, but 4 different GIs and two different probes in 15 years have said no abnormal reflux in the lower esophagus. I’ve also found myself having to wake up and pee once, sometimes twice a night for the last 4-6 years regardless of watching fluid intake before bedtime. No booze, 2 cups of coffee and water/iced tea/soda for lunch.

I’m at the point where I’m having to lay down on my office couch after lunch and again in the evening either before or after dinner. Weekends bring no relief.

I just took this WatchPAT test through GEM Sleep about a month ago and I’m not really sure how to interpret it. I wasn’t able to fall asleep on my back (I rarely sleep on my back, and when I do I end up waking up on my side) so I spent the night on my side. I didn’t feel like I was able to sleep well because the dang finger probe kept rubbing against a cut cuticle, which frustrated the dickens out of me all night.

GEM Sleep just sent me an email and said “your test didn’t say you have sleep apnea”. They then said I could book another billable appointment to discuss further options. I got the impression they were trying to sell dental retainers so I just left it at that.

At pAHI 4.7 I feel like I was borderline and a longer test / more normal night of sleep might have been more representative. I didn’t even pick up on the pRDIs until a month later when I had to pay a bill and decided to throw the test into ChatGPT for fun just to see if it could interpret anything… Now I have no idea what to do. The AI says “your symptoms and test results describe classic UARS, go get an in-lab test”. It also says the best treatment for UARS is CPAP, and my test was almost borderline for OSA. If I go in-lab, I’m guessing I’m spending at least $1,500. I’m tempted to just order another $150 home test using a different testing device like a nightowl and see if I can’t get a result with pAHI over 5 and an OSA Rx to-go for sleep apnea. Has anybody got any advice? I’m pretty beat…

Also, can I take Ambien with these tests? I have an Rx that I don’t use much, but I think I do tend to have a bit better sleep when I do. I don’t use it much because I’m afraid of it being habit-forming.",1,1751515583.0,UARS,1,1.0,False

I’m new to the subreddit but I figured you all would be amazing to help me in my quest. I’m trying to find a bag to make my daily bag and it’s hard to find something that checks all or most of my boxes. Here’s what I’m looking for and I’m well aware I might have lofty criteria for a handbag, sadly. 

1. Decent size/roomy: I carry a good amount of things with me and I like to be prepared. I would love something that can fit a good amount of items without bulging or feeling like everything is too crammed into the purse, I’m okay with outer pockets or compartments too! I thought about a Min & Mon bag but I’m really worried about their crossbody bags not being big enough! I feel like something around 13"" wide could work? 

2. Something structured: I considered a Baggu bag at one point because I know I’d be able to fit a lot into them, but they lack structure to them which would make organization harder, and they’re a bit more casual, which will lead me to my third point.

3. Something that can be dressed up or down: I’m not opposed to certain materials but I do want something that can be versatile; that I can wear with leggings and a shirt to go get coffee in and I can wear with a dress out to dinner with. This is the hardest one I’ve found to check off so far and I’d be the most okay with sacrificing from this list if need be. 

4. If possible, a bag that can make a statement: I dress very maximalist eclectic and I would love if my bag can also be a reflection of that. I loved the black eyes Min & Mon bag because it was a basic black purse with a little something extra (it just didn’t meet my size criteria) so I’m not opposed to a basic black bag with a little accent to it, but I’m open to fun patterns, materials, colorways, etc…

My budget is anything 500 and under (so nothing major designer sadly, someday maybe!) and I’m open to different materials! I also love niche brands so I’m open to some lesser known bag makers or designers! What do you think guys?

I can’t explain it. It’s not even about the caffeine, it’s the entire vibe, the comfort, the consistency. When I go grocery shopping, grabbing a Coke Zero is my top priority. Forget the essentials or the veggies if there’s no Coke Zero in my cart, it’s not happening. I make sure to get enough to last because god forbid I run out midweek. The thought alone stresses me out. Then there’s hanging out with friends. Everyone else orders water or juice or some random drink, and there I am, unapologetically saying, “I’ll have a Coke Zero, please.” And sometimes I swear I see them raise an eyebrow like, “Again?” But honestly, I don’t care. Some people think it’s funny, like it’s some quirky little habit. But to me, it feels more like a lifeline. It’s weird how something so simple can make you feel like your day is complete, like you’re ready to face whatever comes next. I know it’s just soda, but it’s my soda. My constant. My little piece of happiness in an otherwise chaotic world. So yeah, call me obsessed, call me extra but if you feel this way about your own weird little ritual, you get it. Coke Zero isn’t just a drink for me. It’s a part of who I am. Anyone else out there living that Coke Zero life? Or am I the only one?

I’m currently dealing with a work situation that I (28M) need advice on

Before work I go to the gym about every other day. I’m hardly shredded but I’ve gone enough that you can see my muscles when I come into work in short sleeves. I wouldn’t describe myself as a gym bro or a gym rat, I really just go for my overall health. Anyways, I work in an office with maybe 25-30 people that work there. We mainly do business to business sales and supply (not really relevant to the story).

Anyway, I get to work one day wearing a polo and a couple of girls and guys in the office were asking me if I had been working out recently and I told them that I had. It wasn’t flirtatious or anything like that I think they were just giving me a friendly compliment, plus I’m married but as we’re discussing me working out, my coworker Gary (40sM) walks in. Gary is… a lot. He's one of those guys who constantly talks about how much he benches, his ""gains,"" and generally just tries to project this super intense, alpha male image. Which is annoying but none of my business really.

This is where the problem starts. Someone asked me what my max bench was. I told them honestly, and Gary, who was lurking nearby, scoffed. Loudly. He then proceeded to tell me, in front of like five other coworkers, that my number (170) was ""pathetic"" and that I clearly wasn't a ""real man"" or an ""alpha."" He then went on a tirade about how men need to be strong and dominate, etc., etc. It was super uncomfortable.I tried to just laugh it off and change the subject, but it didn't work. Since then, it's gotten worse. Every single day, Gary makes some kind of comment. If I'm getting coffee, he'll ask if I'm ""strong enough to lift the pot."" If I'm walking to my desk, he'll flex and ask if I'm ""inspired yet to hit the weights like a real man.”

I've tried ignoring him, giving him short answers, even politely telling him to knock it off. Nothing works. He just laughs and says I need to ""grow a thicker skin.""

Then, this is where I start to lose my shit a little. My wife (27F) texted me a screenshot yesterday. It was a DM from GARY. It was a picture of him flexing in the mirror with some ridiculous caption about being a ""true alpha"" and how ""real women"" know what's up. (Summarizing but you get the sentiment). He'd somehow found her on social media and sent her this unsolicited picture and message. I was beyond furious. I wanted to march over to his desk and punch him, but I knew that would only make things worse.

I'm starting to dread coming to work. It's constant, it's demeaning, it's making me feel genuinely small and uncomfortable, and now he's involving my wife. Am I overreacting to this? Is this just typical ""guy banter"" that I'm not getting? Should I just suck it up and ignore him, or is this actually something worth addressing with HR? I feel like if I tell HR it might just add fuel to the fire. But if I come down to his level and respond violently, I’ll lose my job.

**Update:** I’m going to take this to HR tomorrow, thank you guys for letting me know the severity of this.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** HR should’ve been involved a long time ago. Be advised he will pursue the wife angle more aggressively than ever
> 
> **OOP:** That’s my concern is that it’ll just make him want to escalate things further
>> 
>> **Commenter 2:** That’s a reasonable fear, but once you report it to HR (explain everything to them as you did here), you can continue to report any retaliation or additional incidents. He is harassing you and creating hostile work environment.
>> 
>> HR’s job is to protect the company from being sued by you by intervening in your coworker’s behavior. Just keep documenting everything because if HR doesn’t effectively do it’s job, you will have a case for a lawsuit.
>> 
>> Obviously the hope is that it won’t come to that. Good luck!
>>> 
>>> **OOP:** I think you’re right. I think I’ve just let his whole thing about calling me weak get to my head. I’m just not into violence and I feel like that’s what he’s trying to provoke

**Downvoted Commenter:** This guy is a deeply wounded narcissistic weirdo. Take this with a huge pinch of salt too, but he can't stand you because of pure envy.  Strategically I'd subtly suggest to downplay your style, gym game, and become subconsciously less threatening, and be as BORING as possible. Relish in the fact that he's wounded by you, but it's clear you've got a target on your back. I don't think HR is a good idea. Quietly submit but not because of fear, feign admiration, stroke his ego, ask him for advice but not in a begging way, play the beta male archetype (you're clearly not, I reckon you project a quiet confidence that is bothersome to him). Don't however cower, or beg him to stop, or even give him short answers. It's just fuel to the fire as he'll get a rise of successfully getting under your skin because he's so disempowered and weak under the bravado.

> **OOP:** I feel like maybe he had a crush on one of my female coworkers that was complimenting me and now is trying to embarrass me to impress them or something. That might not be a bad idea but I think some people have convinced me to go to HR now

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/aZlRB7jzTP): **June 26, 2025 (two days later)**

Here is the link to my first post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/TLYIlrWDGC

Just wanted to update everybody after my last post. I ended up going to HR. I honestly didn’t think HR would do much because Gary is a good employee in terms of performance but surprisingly they took my complaint very seriously and were in disbelief when I showed them the screen shot of the DM he sent to my wife.

The next day, Gary was not at the office so I wasn’t sure if they had fired him or if he was just on a suspension at first but our boss told us to let his clients know that he was out for the day if they call the office. So I assumed that meant he got suspended.

He was back this morning. Usually he greets me with some kind of smart remark but today he was really quiet and seemed to be avoiding eye contact with me. When I went to grab some coffee out of the break room a little after that he came in there and asked if we could talk for a second. He proceeded to tell me that HR laid into him big time and they told him that if he pulled anything like that again, it would result in termination. He then proceeded to apologize to me for everything and said that as pathetic as it sounds he was just upset that nobody ever compliments him on going to the gym despite how much time he spends in the gym in his free time. He said it hurt that people acknowledged me when going to the gym wasn’t as big of a deal for me as it was for him. He then asked for my forgiveness. I honestly felt kind of bad for him in that moment, it was really kinda pathetic but he did seem sorry so I told him I accepted his apology but if he ever messages my wife on anything again, he’ll have a lot more to worry about than an HR complaint. He again apologized.

I don’t know if this situation is fully resolved given it’s only been a half day but Gary has been quiet and not at all like himself. We’ll see if this lasts but his apology felt genuine so hopefully this is the last update I’ll have to give on this situation. Thank you to everybody that encouraged me to go to HR. There was a lot of people that pointed out that Gary must be dealing with a lot of insecurities and I think they were right.

There’s a few things I want to address that were questions in my last post:

How did Gary have my wife’s info? He found her instagram, a lot of people thought he somehow got her number which wasn’t the case.

Is this a made up story? No, if you look at my comment history you will see a screenshot of the Instagram DM’s commented on my last post. It’s so cartoonish that it sounds like fiction but believe me, this is what people who buy into the red pill bull shit are like, you’ll probably encounter your own Gary at some point if you haven’t already

Do I really only bench 170? When I said I benched 170, I meant that bench four sets of 12 at 170. I’ve never done a single rep max.

Does Gary have a wife? No, from my understanding, Gary is divorced and has been single for a while.

**Revelant / Top Comments**

**What was OOP's wife's reaction to the DM and aftermath?**

> **OOP:** She didn’t respond to the dm, just sent the screen shot to me. She thinks Gary is a weirdo and doesn’t think he’ll be getting any woman anytime soon, let alone somebody else’s wife

**Will OOP still be friends with Gary?**

> **OOP:** I don’t think I can ever be friends after he hit up my wife but I can definitely be civil at work. I think people like them might really be dealing with loneliness and are scared people might reject them so they put up a wall

**Commenter 1:** He might have been remorseful, but he absolutely deserves what he got. He crossed a line when he DM'ed your wife unsolicited

A year ago I was pushing 290 lbs and got on a GLP-1. I don’t know if I associate my energy levels with that weight loss journey or not, but for the last year or so I been lacking major energy. I wake up tired because I have to and because I know I won’t be getting any more/better sleep just laying there awake. I have real painful esophageal reflux issues that caused my last ENT to say “I can literally see chemical burns on your vocal chords”, but 4 different GIs and two different probes in 15 years have said no abnormal reflux in the lower esophagus. I’ve also found myself having to wake up and pee once, sometimes twice a night for the last 4-6 years regardless of watching fluid intake before bedtime. No booze, 2 cups of coffee and water/iced tea/soda for lunch.

I’m at the point where I’m having to lay down on my office couch after lunch and again in the evening either before or after dinner. Weekends bring no relief.

I just took this WatchPAT test through GEM Sleep about a month ago and I’m not really sure how to interpret it. I wasn’t able to fall asleep on my back (I rarely sleep on my back, and when I do I end up waking up on my side) so I spent the night on my side. I didn’t feel like I was able to sleep well because the dang finger probe kept rubbing against a cut cuticle, which frustrated the dickens out of me all night.

GEM Sleep just sent me an email and said “your test didn’t say you have sleep apnea”. They then said I could book another billable appointment to discuss further options. I got the impression they were trying to sell dental retainers so I just left it at that.

At pAHI 4.7 I feel like I was borderline and a longer test / more normal night of sleep might have been more representative. I didn’t even pick up on the pRDIs until a month later when I had to pay a bill and decided to throw the test into ChatGPT for fun just to see if it could interpret anything… Now I have no idea what to do. The AI says “your symptoms and test results describe classic UARS, go get an in-lab test”. It also says the best treatment for UARS is CPAP, and my test was almost borderline for OSA. If I go in-lab, I’m guessing I’m spending at least $1,500. I’m tempted to just order another $150 home test using a different testing device like a nightowl and see if I can’t get a result with pAHI over 5 and an OSA Rx to-go for sleep apnea. Has anybody got any advice? I’m pretty beat…

Also, can I take Ambien with these tests? I have an Rx that I don’t use much, but I think I do tend to have a bit better sleep when I do. I don’t use it much because I’m afraid of it being habit-forming.",1,1751515399.0,UARS,1,1.0,False

1lqg2ng,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/1lqg2ng/what_is_going_on/,What is going on?,"Hi, 19 year old here. Soon to be 20! This is some of my last resorts since when in doubt -- ask the community. I'm not on insurance and am waiting to be approved, but recently had unprotected sex during high ovulation (forgot), and something weird happened a few days ago. Around June 26th I was supposed to have my period, but it was late for awhile until June 29th, where I saw some watery pink stuff on my toilet paper after wiping. It wasn't old brown blood or dark, thick blood like I have been getting since I started at 9. I know my periods, they're irregular in time but very consistent. I always have brown blood/dark red at the start, pass a bunch of heavy loads with clots, and then it stops a week later. I have never seen the pink watery stuff before, and I wasn't bleeding at all! Pink watery stuff kept coming out occasionally whenever I wiped, and I had experienced light cramps for the first time ever (mine are usually super strong). They stopped the 29th, and I continued spotting until the 30th.   
  
I was nauseous and threw up a little in the morning of the 30th, and didn't have an appetite for awhile, but I ate small snacks. While walking around the mall, I suddenly felt very fatigued and had the worst cramping of my life. I went into the bathroom and just sat there for about 20 minutes watching a lot of blood come out. Very bright with no clotting. I was confused, as I thought it was my period. When I wiped, this pink/white fleshy things came out, and only that. It was about the size of my finger. I have never seen it before, and while looking it up, thought it was a decidual cast. I haven't been on birth control for over a year, and didn't have any contraceptives that have the chemical responsible. My boyfriend and I also don't have sex that often (we're both asexual). My cramping, nausea, fatigue, and bleeding stopped right after that came out, and I cried confusedly for the entire way home. Don't know why. Anyway, everything has stopped, I had a bit of cramping in my lower back and on the left side of my abdomen,  but that was it. Now, two days later, I'm wiping and notice brown blood and coffee ground-looking bits every time I wipe. I have also never seen this before. I'm worried if it's just how decidual casts work, since I've never had one before, and since both of my pregnancy test came out negative, I'm assuming it isn't a miscarriage. Or at least I'm hoping it isn't. I went to Planned Parenthood on the 30th, who could only do a urine pregnancy test, which also came out negative. I did a test on the 29th which also came out negative. I don't know what's going on and if this is normal. People who have had decidual casts or similar things happen to them-- what should I do? Am I good to calm down or is there something to freak out about? My insurance application hasn't been approved yet, and I don't know any places to do an exam for free. I'm also terrified, since I've never had one and I'm only 19. ",1,1751515340.0,Healthyhooha,0,1.0,False

My husband and I are heading to Paris July 7th for the very first time, and we're staying at the Novotel Porte de Versailles until July 12th. Now we have two extra nights after that to stay somewhere else before heading to London! 

Two questions:   
  
1- We were thinking of spending those couple days in Versailles and getting tickets to the palace, but I wanted to ask the pros: is Versailles a good option for this extra time? What are some other places we could go that wouldn't be too far from Paris and give us different experiences than the city?  
  
2- We are also open to spending those extra days in Paris and exploring the city more. Which neighborhood should we stay in that would be a different feel from the 15th arrondissement? We love coffee, botanical gardens, basically all kinds of food, bakeries, and boutiques, and we're happy just wandering around. No need to stay near the Louvre or the Eiffel Tower, as we will have already been there. We like lively but are not looking for a big party spot.

I attend a non-target university in Toronto. Despite trying everything, networking, coffee chats, cold emails, and applying to hundreds of jobs, I failed to get an internship this year.

I am a Finance Co-op student entering my 4th year, and so far, I have only done one internship. In Canada summer  breaks are 4 month long; this is the time where student go work, do research project or do summer school.

I took summer courses during the Spring/Summer 2025 term, a now I have two months free with nothing to do.

I failed to get a co-op placement in the Winter and Summer 2025 cycles, and I am facing the same struggles for Fall. This is the second time I have failed to get a summer internship.

I’m just depressed and broken. After failing to get an internship in my first year and doing nothing for four straight months, I promised myself I would never be in this position again. I did manage to get a second year internship, but now my life has hit bottom again with no opportunities this summer.

It’s frustrating. I’ve applied to hundreds of internships, scholarships, programs, conferences etc. I got nothing.

I’m ready to work. I’m ready to learn. I’m ready to do anything. But I’m not getting any opportunities.

People talk about missed chances while I’m begging for one.

Every day I scroll through LinkedIn and see posts of people sharing their internship offers, companies showing their summer 2025 intern class, and many other bullshit. Meanwhile, I can’t even get any interviews. Most of the time, it feels like my applications disappear.

I have spent a lot of my time networking and setting up coffee chats, but most people don’t respond or leave me on read. They're a handful of nice people who done coffee chats with me, which I'm thankful for.

It’s frustrating seeing my peers from the Class of 2026 and even Class of 2027 with multiple internships at prestigious companies while I can't get anything. I have three co-op terms left and I’m aiming for roles like summer analyst or public equities. But nothing is working out.

I’m depressed. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I  wake up and do nothing with my life. No purpose, no money, and I’ve lost all my ambition to build projects or go to the gym.

I understand I attend a non-target school but I'm trying my best and I'm reaching out to alumni and everything. I'm not getting anything. People just don't wanna help.

Here’s mine:

This was on an Air France flight, pre-Covid. For context I’ve since flown a lot on many airlines and classes. The trip I refer to was when I first began doing more transcontinental legs, flying coach, before my miles started to mean anything. 

I was flying from Hong Kong to Lisbon with a connecting a flight in Paris some years ago. After the lunch service, the FA, a smiling mature blonde, asked if I’d like a coffee or tea. I asked hopefully if she had hot chocolate. She oohed an affirmative and said she’d be right back. 

A minute later, she came to my seat stirring a cup, and told me to “be careful, it’s hot.” Then with a grin that crinkled her eyes but showed her sparkle, she passed me my hot chocolate saying, “and made with love”. The last syllable was drawn out deliciously, “looove”. Not flirty at all though I couldn’t stop grinning like a bashful fool.

I felt the weight of the many tight hours in coach melt away, and those words are forever associated with hot chocolate, which I sipped slowly for as long as I could, savoring not just the excellent beverage but the warmth of connection. I wish I knew her name to thank her for that little gesture and service that went way beyond the usual.

Ok, share yours pls.

I'm so excited to meet her but we are really concerned with my min pin/chihuahua mix. I'll try to make this as concise as possible.

My dog has always been an anxious dog. He means the world to me and I've had him almost ten years. I recently made the move to my girlfriend's state with him after we became pregnant. My girlfriend has a pug and they get along generally... And the pug is very good with kids mine not so much. He is afraid of them. First time he bit a kid it was my nephew he was sitting between my sister and mother and I wasn't there but my nephew put his face in my dogs face and he bit him on the lip. He had to go to the ER and get stitches. Recently we went away for the weekend and left him and the pug with a dog sitter who is a friend of my girlfriend who also has kids. Her kid was eating a cooking and my dog was sitting near him and the kid tried to push him away and he bit him on the ear and drew blood. He has also nipped at my girlfriend's daughter's friend when I repeatedly told the kid not to try and pet him. You can see it coming he gets very nervous. He likes to sit next to my girlfriend's daughter but I can tell he gets on edge when he pets her.

The pug and my dog get in horrible fights over food, or sometimes jealousy over attention. The other day my pregnant girlfriend was having coffee outside and they got into one of these fights. She can't break them up so I did then I came back out and found her crying. She is really worried something might happen to the baby either through one of these fights or a snapping incident (I am of course worried about this too and have been). I told her we would figure it out. 

Later that night I found her sobbing in bed completely overwhelmed and worried about the situation. Im also emotionally overwhelmed at this point. I don't have excess money right now for training. 

Aside from all of the above mentioned I'm just completely overwhelmed by all. My dog has been my constant companion and I want the best for him and to be assured he can live a long healthy, happy life. Giving him up is an utterly devastating idea to me and honestly I have been having trouble functioning this week thinking about it but it may honestly just be the best option at this point. This post isn't the best put together, lacks punctuation and probably does not flow well but I don't have the mental capacity right now to read through it all again.

It doesn’t ask permission, It just takes. It gnaws at your edges while you pretend to be composed, while you wake up, drink your coffee, put on your rings and your lipstick, and walk out the door like you’re not already halfway devoured.

Deadlines. 
Smiles. 
Wasted youth. 

All of it stacked neatly like unpaid debts next to the wine bottles and the memories you’ve tried to scrub out with bleach and prayer. The only things that seem to age well are a good scotch and a God-fearing man, and even God has stopped fearing me.

We all start out as dreamers. Bright eyed. Naïve. Soft around the edges. We believe in reward. We believe if we’re good enough, or beautiful enough, or strategic enough, we’ll be safe. The world doesn’t deal in goodness, It deals in blood and no one walks away without paying.

Some people work themselves to death just to keep breathing. They grind their bones to ash and call it duty. Others drink themselves into slow decay, no fire, no urgency, just resignation draped in excuses. Then there are the ones who get everything. The ones who played the game and won. The ones who built a perfect life with the perfect house and the perfect partner and the perfect résumé. They got what they wanted.

But the devil works like a genie. He doesn’t steal. He bargains. Three wishes, each costing more than the last. You asked for success, Now you bleed in marble bathrooms and sign contracts with a trembling hand. You asked for love, Now your chest is a vault you forgot how to open. You asked for status, Now your name is just a currency that others use to climb.

The house you built is a tomb. The job you begged for now strips you daily, and those friends with the perfect white teeth? They’d rape you clean and call it charity. They’d gut you in public, parade your corpse through a gala, and still toast your name with thousand dollar champagne. 

You wear your coffin in couture. You raise a glass to your own execution. You die every day a little quieter, a little more elegantly.

I have everything and still, I feel nothing. No joy, No light, Just the knowledge that I must have prayed too hard, or maybe to the wrong god. Because the God I knew wouldn’t hand me this life and then leave me choking on it. He wouldn’t let me drown while I screamed His name into the silence. He wouldn’t keep me alive just to watch me decay from the inside out.

But maybe He died the day I stopped believing in grace. Maybe He was never watching to begin with. Maybe I was born into a world where there are no angels, just hunters and prey, and the moment you stop moving, they smell you, and they come.

The view is perfect. The walls don’t speak anymore. The foundation has cracked and no one noticed. Behind my eyes, there is only rot. No softness. No warmth. Just memory and fire. I owe a debt, and I’m paying, in silence, in wine, in vanished days and brittle smiles.

You say you see me, but if I carved myself open, would you even look? Or would you wear my pain like fur? Would you unzip my grief, fuck the bones of who I used to be, and call it intimacy?

Beautiful souls find comfort in darkness, not because they’re broken, but because it’s the only place they aren’t hunted. The world offers two choices: cowboy or dreamer. Break your back or break your spirit. Obey or disappear. But either way, you bleed. Either way, it ends in sacrifice.

So cheat the game. Gut the players. Burn the mask they gave you and become something too holy in your violence to ever be tamed. Become sacred through your silence. Terrifying through your stillness. I did.

My daddy once told me, “To be misunderstood is a gift. The ones who try to understand you will either slit your throat or raise you from the dead. Pay attention. It always costs the same.”

So how much are you willing to spend when the only outcomes are life or death, and nothing in between? Will you hand over your children, your lovers, your softness? Will you bury every innocent part of yourself just to survive another day in this gilded hell?

Or will you settle, be a cowboy, a dreamer, a relic of someone else’s design? A puppet dressed in gold, still swinging from the same old noose?

Just remember this:

It all costs the same.

Rest in power, Daddy.
You always knew.
Some daughters are born to bury, and some, are born to burn the whole goddamn world

I'm so excited to meet her but we are really concerned with my min pin/chihuahua mix. I'll try to make this as concise as possible.

My dog has always been an anxious dog. He means the world to me and I've had him almost ten years. I recently made the move to my girlfriend's state with him after we became pregnant. My girlfriend has a pug and they get along generally... And the pug is very good with kids mine not so much. He is afraid of them. First time he bit a kid it was my nephew he was sitting between my sister and mother and I wasn't there but my nephew put his face in my dogs face and he bit him on the lip. He had to go to the ER and get stitches. Recently we went away for the weekend and left him and the pug with a dog sitter who is a friend of my girlfriend who also has kids. Her kid was eating a cooking and my dog was sitting near him and the kid tried to push him away and he bit him on the ear and drew blood. He has also nipped at my girlfriend's daughter's friend when I repeatedly told the kid not to try and pet him. You can see it coming he gets very nervous. He likes to sit next to my girlfriend's daughter but I can tell he gets on edge when he pets her.

The pug and my dog get in horrible fights over food, or sometimes jealousy over attention. The other day my pregnant girlfriend was having coffee outside and they got into one of these fights. She can't break them up so I did then I came back out and found her crying. She is really worried something might happen to the baby either through one of these fights or a snapping incident (I am of course worried about this too and have been). I told her we would figure it out. 

Later that night I found her sobbing in bed completely overwhelmed and worried about the situation. Im also emotionally overwhelmed at this point. I don't have excess money right now for training. 

Aside from all of the above mentioned I'm just completely overwhelmed by all. My dog has been my constant companion and I want the best for him and to be assured he can live a long healthy, happy life. Giving him up is an utterly devastating idea to me and honestly I have been having trouble functioning this week thinking about it but it may honestly just be the best option at this point. This post isn't the best put together, lacks punctuation and probably does not flow well but I don't have the mental capacity right now to read through it all again.

I grew up watching one of my aunt's life get destroyed by MLM after MLM, I was there getting dragged around to her ""craft fairs"" which could more accurately be described as MLM product swaps to work her booth because I've always had a natural talent for sales. I've also seen first hand the damage a MLM can actually do to someone's finances and the inability to get themselves out after a certain point - it's one thing to switch careers in you 20s, 30s and if you're really lucky 40s...but once you're past that, it's nearly impossible to convince a company to invest their time, energy and resources to train someone with zero relevant experience. In my baby adult days, I had a career in sales/sales management - I built my brand on honesty, integrity, employee development and bringing those that were willing to put in the up with me. I eventually got tired of the hours, repetitive nature, working indoors, aggressive/predatory metrics, and generally the constant pressure to put my morals and paycheck at odds. These days I'm just a dumb electrician...in a strong union, have amazing benefits and have a much healthier work life balance/overall better quality of life. Not to mention the best part: no more business casual attire.

Sometimes when I'm feeling spicy and I'll let a recruiter do their little spiel and I like to play a game - they try to recruit me, while I try to poke holes in their ""it's not a cult/pyramid scheme/you don't know the meaning of financial freedom,"" mentality. Until today, every pitch has been heavily focused on recruitment. Today the poor guy spent 50/60 minutes struggling to explain how an IUL works - he then switched to the recruitment/commission structure phase where I got to ask my favorite question: ""I'm a little slow, can you draw me a picture of how it works?"" ...and then watch them draw a pyramid before switching to: ""so can you explain to me how this is different from a pyramid scheme?"" Every so often I'll see a glimmer of hope where they realize they've been drinking the Kool Aid. At worst, they're wasting their time on me, not some other unsuspecting individual and I get some free coffee.

It doesn’t ask permission, It just takes. It gnaws at your edges while you pretend to be composed, while you wake up, drink your coffee, put on your rings and your lipstick, and walk out the door like you’re not already halfway devoured.

Deadlines. 
Smiles. 
Wasted youth. 

All of it stacked neatly like unpaid debts next to the wine bottles and the memories you’ve tried to scrub out with bleach and prayer. The only things that seem to age well are a good scotch and a God-fearing man, and even God has stopped fearing me.

We all start out as dreamers. Bright eyed. Naïve. Soft around the edges. We believe in reward. We believe if we’re good enough, or beautiful enough, or strategic enough, we’ll be safe. The world doesn’t deal in goodness, It deals in blood and no one walks away without paying.

Some people work themselves to death just to keep breathing. They grind their bones to ash and call it duty. Others drink themselves into slow decay, no fire, no urgency, just resignation draped in excuses. Then there are the ones who get everything. The ones who played the game and won. The ones who built a perfect life with the perfect house and the perfect partner and the perfect résumé. They got what they wanted.

But the devil works like a genie. He doesn’t steal. He bargains. Three wishes, each costing more than the last. You asked for success, Now you bleed in marble bathrooms and sign contracts with a trembling hand. You asked for love, Now your chest is a vault you forgot how to open. You asked for status, Now your name is just a currency that others use to climb.

The house you built is a tomb. The job you begged for now strips you daily, and those friends with the perfect white teeth? They’d rape you clean and call it charity. They’d gut you in public, parade your corpse through a gala, and still toast your name with thousand dollar champagne. 

You wear your coffin in couture. You raise a glass to your own execution. You die every day a little quieter, a little more elegantly.

I have everything and still, I feel nothing. No joy, No light, Just the knowledge that I must have prayed too hard, or maybe to the wrong god. Because the God I knew wouldn’t hand me this life and then leave me choking on it. He wouldn’t let me drown while I screamed His name into the silence. He wouldn’t keep me alive just to watch me decay from the inside out.

But maybe He died the day I stopped believing in grace. Maybe He was never watching to begin with. Maybe I was born into a world where there are no angels, just hunters and prey, and the moment you stop moving, they smell you, and they come.

I have been experiencing horrible horrible pain around my sternum lower chest area. First time I experienced this was in November 2024. It was after I had a big meal and I was stuffed. The pain was so bad I had to pull over. I’ve never had a heart attack but the pain wasn’t in my upper chest area  so I didn’t think that was it. 
I didn’t experience the pain again until mid January. I was in bed, just drank a cup of coffee, and the pain was HORRIBLE! I laid in bed just holding my boobs because I just didn’t know what to do! Pain lasted maybe 5 minutes?
Well, now here I am, July, and I’m getting the pain every couple of days but very mildly. However, now, my nipples are absolutely on fire. I haven’t felt this sensation since I had mastitis 4 years ago. 
About two months ago, I got this pencil eraser size bruise directly where my sternum bone is.

He'd counted them, savoring each second like a man who'd learned to appreciate the absence of magical chaos the way others appreciated fine wine.

The peace ended with a knock. Not the soggy gravel knock of yesterday's troll, but something more professional. 

Jake opened the door to find a goblin in a pinstripe suit. The goblin was roughly three feet tall, impeccably groomed, and carried a briefcase that probably cost more than Jake's rent. His teeth were filed to points and his smile could have cut glass.

""Mr. Parker,"" the goblin said in a voice like honey poured over broken bones. ""Name's Vinny 'The Knuckle' Grimswallow. I represent certain interests.""

""If this is about the unpaid pizza delivery fee from 2019, I can explain""

""It's about the dame.""

Jake blinked. ""The what now?""

""The dame. The broad. The skirt. The"" Vinny gestured impatiently ""The lady what was here yesterday. Helina Blackthorne.""

""She's not here. She went home. To her apartment. Where she lives. Without me.""

Vinny's smile widened. ""See, that's where you're wrong, Parker. She ain't at home. She ain't anywhere. She's been relocated.""

Jake's blood turned to ice water. ""What do you mean, relocated?""

""Kidnapped, snatched, acquired against her will, take your pick. Point is, she's gone, and my boss wants to have a little chat with you about getting her back.""

Before Jake could respond, something pink and massive squeezed through his bathroom window. It was an alligator. A pink alligator wearing what appeared to be a meditation beads necklace and a serene expression.

""Oh dear,"" said the alligator in a voice like warm butter mixed with philosophy. ""I'm afraid I'm a bit late. The negative energy in this apartment is simply overwhelming.""

Vinny spun around. ""What the""

""Profanity creates ripples in the cosmic pond, small angry creature,"" the alligator said gently. ""I am Serenity. I'm here about the missing woman.""

Jake rubbed his temples. ""Of course you are. Because Tuesday wasn't surreal enough yet.""

Serenity settled her considerable bulk on Jake's couch, which groaned in protest. ""I had a vision during my morning meditation. A woman surrounded by darkness, calling for help. The spirits whispered your name, Jake Parker.""

""The spirits need to mind their own business,"" Jake muttered.

Vinny snapped his fingers. ""Enough with the pink philosophy hour. Parker, you're coming with me. My boss wants to make a deal.""

""What kind of deal?""

""The kind where you help us get something we want, and in return, your lady friend doesn't end up as troll food.""

Jake's heart skipped. ""Trolls? Is Mubble involved in this?""

""Mubble? Nah, different trolls. These ones ain't got the whole 'romantic confusion' thing going on. They're more into the 'crushing bones for fun' business model.""

Serenity sighed, a sound like wind through pink palm trees. ""Violence is never the answer, small suit-wearing creature. Have you considered talking through your feelings?""

""Have you considered shutting your scaly trap?""

""I'm actually quite smooth, thank you. And surprisingly soft to the touch.""

Jake held up his hands. ""Everybody stop. Vinny, who's your boss, and what does he want?""

""Boss goes by The Collector. He's got a thing for rare magical artifacts. Word is, you got something he wants.""

""I don't have anything. I'm aggressively ordinary.""

Vinny pulled out a photograph. It showed Jake's coat, the same coat that had been cursed by Belladonna. ""This coat. It's been touched by love magic, fear magic, and anti-hex elixir. That's a rare combination. Makes it valuable to certain collectors.""

""You want my coat?""

""Boss wants your coat. In exchange, you get the dame back. Simple transaction.""

Serenity's eyes went wide. ""Oh my. That coat has absorbed considerable emotional energy. It's practically humming with psychic residue.""

Jake looked at his coat hanging innocently on the rack. ""It's just a coat. I got it at a thrift store.""

""Sometimes,"" Serenity said wisely, ""the most powerful magic hides in the most ordinary places. Like enlightenment in a gas station bathroom.""

""That's... oddly specific.""

""Tuesday was a difficult day for me.""

Vinny checked his watch. ""Tick tock, Parker. Boss ain't known for his patience. You got one hour to decide. Meet us at the old warehouse on Crescent Street. Bring the coat, get the dame. Simple.""

He headed for the door, then paused. ""Oh, and Parker? Don't try anything clever. Boss has got eyes everywhere. And some of them ain't human.""

After Vinny left, Jake slumped in his chair. ""This is insane. They kidnapped Helina for a coat.""

""Not just any coat,"" Serenity said thoughtfully. ""A coat that has experienced love, betrayal, magic, and resolution. It's like a magical mood ring, but in jacket form.""

""Can you help me get her back?""

Serenity's expression grew serious. ""I don't condone violence, Jake Parker. But I also don't condone the imprisonment of innocent beings. Perhaps we can find a middle path.""

""What kind of middle path?""

""The kind where I create a distraction while you rescue your friend. I'm quite good at distractions. Did you know I can sing opera?""

Jake stared at her. ""You're a pink alligator who does meditation and opera?""

""I'm a complex individual. We all contain multitudes.""

Jake grabbed his coat from the rack. The moment he touched it, he felt a strange tingling sensation. ""You know what? Fine. Let's go save Helina. But after this, I'm moving somewhere magic doesn't exist.""

""I'm afraid that's impossible,"" Serenity said gently. ""Magic exists everywhere. The trick is learning to live with it instead of fighting it.""

""Can you at least promise me no more talking kitchen appliances?""

From the kitchen came a muffled voice: ""I heard that! And I'm a beverage preparation device, not a kitchen appliance!""

Jake looked at his new coffee maker. ""When did you start talking?""

""About five minutes ago. I've been trying to get your attention. Your coffee tastes like despair because you keep buying the cheap stuff.""

Serenity chuckled. ""See? Magic finds a way.""

Jake grabbed his keys. ""Come on. Let's go save Helina before my microwave starts giving relationship advice.""

As they headed for the door, Jake's phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number: ""Bring the coat. Come alone. P.S. Your friend says hello and also several colorful words about your fashion choices.""

Jake smiled despite himself. ""That's definitely Helina.""

""How can you tell?""

""She's the only person I know who can insult me through a kidnapper's text message.""

Serenity nodded approvingly. ""A woman of spirit. I like her already.""

Jake looked at his coat one more time. ""I can't believe I'm about to trade magical outerwear for a rescue mission.""

""Sometimes the most valuable things we own are the people we care about,"" Serenity said. ""The coat is just fabric and thread. Helina is irreplaceable.""

""When did you become a philosopher?""

""Tuesday. It's been a very enlightening day.""

Jake opened the door, and they stepped out into a world where gangster goblins, pink alligators, and kidnapped friends were apparently just another Tuesday afternoon.

""I really need to find a new apartment,"" Jake muttered.

""Perhaps,"" Serenity said with a gentle smile, ""the apartment isn't the problem. Perhaps you're exactly where you need to be.""

""That's what I'm afraid of.""

To be continued... probably sooner than Jake would like.

\- Wierdo of Earth-7070896RG is the pride of his own Tophattist, and the E\*0A Racing Community as a whole. Ever since he had started racing in the E\*0A street tournaments, things have been going easy, and as it would turn out; he's a pro by heart. Using his fame and funds to deck out his Tophattist's car (The Red-Flash), it became increasingly easy with every win to win more. Though he'd sometimes get 2nd or 3rd place, his fans still cheer for him, and he refuses to give up, even if it means getting shot at more in Crash-Out Street Tournaments. Wierdo of Earth-7070896RG is almost always accompanied by his faithful partner, Tophattist of Earth-7070896RG; whom is always there to conduct maintenance on the Red-Flash, and operate the craft's In-Built Turret System.

\- The Twisted Metal Contest has come to Wierdo of Earth-7070896RG's attention through small talk on E\*0A, and has since decided to join in hopes of winning himself a wish. Besides that, he can't wait to show off his hot ride and expertise in racing to yet another recently discovered corner of the multiverse.

\- If Wierdo of Earth-7070896RG was to win a wish, he'd definitely wish to race again some time.

# Tophattist-E*7070896RG

\- Tophattist of Earth-7070896RG had built the Red-Flash as a project vehicle to test his quantum tunneling technology on, but never expected it to be one of the most iconic street-race cars in the multiverse under any means. It's been years since Wierdo of Earth-7070896RG made his craft famous in the eyes of all E\*0A beholders and beyond, and yet he still continues to tune and tinker with it to make it better and better. He's glad to have survived the first 2 Tophatter Wars, and continues to shed his support for his Wierdo's hobby of being a professional street racer.

\- Tophattist of Earth-7070896RG is mostly tasked with directing the Red-Flash's Retractable Holo-Dart Turret from the passenger-side seat using that craft's Retractable Holo-Dart Turret-Compatible Laser-Guided Radio Gun.

# The Red-Flash

\- The Red-Flash, a sight to behold; it is a 4-seater land yacht convertible, though with a stronger internal frame. The craft has 0-turn wheel wells with electromagnetic couplings, a Q-4 hydrogen-cell/combustion hybrid engine with an auxiliary nuclear steam torque cell, a retractable holo-dart turret under a hatch the is attached to the hood, and liquid substance KG-7 boosters in the rear. The unmuffled exhaust tubes empty into the atmosphere at the front of the craft immediately after the front tires, and it is loud as hell.

\- Also has comfortable tan leather seats and several compartments for tools. Also has an on-board coffee dispenser.

# Tunes

\- Jamming out is a common thing while racing on E\*0A, and they even have entire radio stations dedicated to keeping active drivers hyped and informed. The Red-Flash crew typically loves to jam to classic rock, and similar tunes.

1lqfify,https://v.redd.it/weq87yf1xkaf1,Troubleshoot barista express no pressure building.,"Hi everyone i need your help on resolving my issue. 

I bought this machine from marketplace for a steal price. Previous owner told me it was old like 8-9years old.

The issue when backflushing or pulling a shot is not building pressure. 


Steps I did when fixing the issue
1. Descale the machine 50:50 vinegar water solution. ✅
2. Cleaning tablet.  Single basket shot with the cleaning disk. ✅ 

Both 1&2 removed some old coffee gunk and white parts. But pressure is still not building up when having the cleaning disk. 

3. Opened up the machine and checked all hoses if water is passing. ✅
4. Cleaned the thermal block mineral build up. Did a blow on one end and ensure it reaches  the end. ✅

5. Replaced the seal gasket on the grouphead. 


What else should i do? Need your advice if I should replace other parts. 

Thanks! ",1,1751513551.0,BrevilleCoffee,6,1.0,False
1lqfhvs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lqfhvs,Just went on vacation and when I come back there is a bee colony in my garden🐝,"So I went on a holiday to czech republic (was very nice btw) and when I come back I see my entire garden is full of bees😂 (like 100's of em). I know that bees are a endangered species and I love these little fellas so I called the first beekeeper I found on Facebook to help me out. He made this special wooden box for the bees to sette (second picture)

When he came (in a full suit, it looked hilarious), he searched for the Queen and once he found her all the bees started to follow him. That was so fun to watch. He placed the Queen carefully in the box and all the bees soon followed. Of course they were very angry then so the buzzing was very loud but after approximately 15 minutes they calmed down and it became quiet. We drank some Coffee to let the bees settle in to theire new temporary home and he got in the suit again and took the bees to his apiary. I waved the fellas goodbye and was so happy to see so many bees. There has been a lot of news recently how there are less and less bees due to climate change and I had seen less and less myself over the years. Seeing such a big colony of hard workers together warms my heart.

My neighbour told me she only heard the buzzing noise 1 day before I came back. I found that fascinating because they were so settled in already so I decided to ask the beekeeper how that's possible. He told me that bees look for places all the time and once they find a good spot they settle there in an hour😂 I'm going to miss my 100's of little buddy's but they are in a good place now instead of a busy neighbourhood.",32,1751513500.0,MadeMeSmile,7,0.97,False

(Shout out to the free drinks and flan during a short power outage at Hotel Plaza Yara that turned us into an accidental family <3 )


15 years, multiple health problems for me including celiac disease, and 2 daughters later means our trip needs to be way different this time.  They won't be able to deal with me staring at moss and looking for birds for hours like their Dad did. 


Dad is leaning towards returning to Manuel Antonio because of the wildlife and beach. One of our daughters will likely be too panicked to stay near any volcanos as much as I'd like to return to Arenal. I think we should try the Uvita or Ostional areas. 


We are not well off so resorts are out. Dad would like the nightly hotel price to be well under (USD) $200. We won't all surf or zipline or whitewater raft or do anything too adventurous (Dad might alone if it's not too long away from us). We will rent a car. We live within an hour of the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico in Florida so big preference to visiting the Pacific side. The girls are into coffee / sweets so thinking we should try for an interesting coffee tour of some sort. The girls and I do not travel well (motion sickness, picky eating, random phobias etc) but we still love to keep exploring!

To be perfectly cliche, it all began one unassuming October evening. I was carving pumpkins with my mother and had set the top of mine back on the counter with mindful precision to prevent it from rolling onto the floor. I set off to the sink to rinse my hands and as soon as I did I heard a loud THUD from behind me. The pumpkin top was no longer where I’d left it. It was now sitting smugly on the floor in front of the refrigerator. According to my mother’s report, the second I turned my back to it, the top of the pumpkin skidded across the counter on its own and slammed forcefully against the refrigerator door.

That’s the night we met Clark. 

Clark was a private sort of spirit. My mother and I never felt threatened by him but he didn’t care much for us making his presence known. We talked about recent episodes with friends and family but mostly excitedly relayed them between ourselves. After years of learning to live with him and his quirks, I headed to the library one afternoon to find a slice of solace. By pure serendipity I met a friend of a friend amongst the stacks who invited me to her first meeting of her local paranormal investigative team. All I had to do to accept was pop on into Study Room #2 in a few minutes. Excitedly I began to tell her that I actually lived down the road with an active spirit. “His name is.. is.. um.. just a second. I need to step out.” I blanked. Distressed by this sudden amnesia, my face began to heat to boiling as I threw on my coat, pushed in the chair, rushed past the help desk, down the stairs and out the front door. All the while I tried over and over to remember his name. As the cool winter air hit my face my memory returned in an instant. “Clark. His name is Clark.” I didn’t go to the meeting and I never called the acquaintance. 

I didn’t feel stifled by Clark’s possessiveness but rather protected. One day I had to be driven to work because despite turning the house upside down my keys could not be found anywhere. Eventually they were located in the furthest corner of the hall closet on the floor. Perhaps Clark knew something we didn’t and was keeping me safe from an untimely fate. Once when I was reading a book of ghost stories, right next to my head I heard what sounded like fingernails dancing along the wall almost playfully. I wasn’t scared. I just smiled to myself and continued reading. 

Everything was fine until the altar incident. 

I was a practicing witch at the time and had a spread of small candles laid out as part of an ongoing ritual. I came home one day to find one of them not only out of place but teetering on the very edge of the table I kept them on. Around the same time I came home to find a Hello Kitty doll lying in the middle of my altar like some perverse sacrifice or glaring mockery of my practice. These incidents made me feel uneasy. They felt invasive bordering on malicious. Clark no longer felt like a friend.. if it even was Clark.

Enter Diane.

I had started exchanging emails with a local medium. Given that these events were occurring in a rural Maine town in the mid-2010s she may have been the only one. Diane agreed to come visit our apartment to tell us what she sensed and whether it warranted a return visit for a proper investigation with all the bells and whistles. She described a hunched over elderly woman with a tight knot of hair on the top of her head. My mother and I exchanged a look. Diane was of course describing Bess the former landowner who had lived in the ground floor apartment and who had passed away a few years ago. We were taken aback by this assessment because we were so confident it was always her husband Clark we were contending with. Diane continued to make her way through the house as we exchanged stories for insight. Nothing really stands out from the visit as I look back except one occurrence after Diane’s departure. The toilet seat was up. None of us had used the bathroom since Diane had arrived and it was just the two of us in the house. To us the message was clear: I’m not Bess. 

So our spirit was a man. What made us so certain it was Clark in particular? A very easy question to answer. Shortly before the inaugural incident in October, the attic space in the adjacent apartment began intensive renovations. The attic space belonged to the ground floor apartment where Bess had lived. It’s where she used to live with Clark. The attic space is also where Clark killed himself. I have always been rather skeptical of anything that cannot be proven so the theory that ghosts will act out when the physical space they spent their last moments in is disturbed was nothing more than just that to me.. a theory. In this case it makes sense. A man of staunch Catholic faith when he was living, it is understandable that he would do things like smack pumpkin tops off tables and place toys onto pagan altars. Once we even watched as a stack of books toppled themselves off the coffee table. Amongst those that went flying was one about ghosts, one about aliens.. but the one that remained perfectly placed was one called Conversations with God. Clark’s shenanigans continued to brighten the monotony of everyday living as having him around became as normal as a dirty dish in the sink or a floor that needs sweeping. The only thing that changed after Diane’s visit was me telling him firmly and often that he was not to mess with my things and to my relief he stopped.

Eventually we moved but whenever I drive by that old converted farmhouse on New Bridgeton Road.. I wonder whether the current residents enjoy their Halloween season peacefully or whether the man of the house ever gets unfairly blamed for leaving the toilet seat up.

the problem is... my gf always has a reason as to why they can't go out. all of her reasons are valid and i am willing to compromise naman, it's just that whenever i ask ""kailan ka free?"" o ""gusto ko mag-date"" i'm always met with vague replies of going out ""soon"" o kaya ""i'll have to see"".

i'm getting frustrated na with this kasi kung kaya naman niya gumala with friends after class, bat parang need ko pa i-aya siya na magdate? i mean in fairness maybe she thinks na dates should be a whole-day thing and so she wants a special o specific date just for us but all i want is for her to try and spend time with me or try and initiate something with me. kahit quick coffee date lang after class parang ang bigat na para sa kaniya pero gala with friends? g no need to plan beforehand kahit sponty lang. i feel like i shouldn't feel like this kasi parang ang maldita ng dahilan ko but at the same time i want to communicate this to her and find a way to compromise but at the same time, parang i feel that the efforts in our relationship as of late have been more on my end (hala sana di to parang mayabang)

And for eternity, we'll not exist again. All we get is a momentary life for a few decades. To feel that these few decades have been well spent, each of us assigns an idea to it; each of us has a set of things we want. If we get that, we feel these years are well spent; otherwise, we believe our life has been wasted.
For me, that idea is to love you extremely; keep you ""shawl-ed""; take care of you; make you laugh. Forever.

You believed in ""Small gestures and consistent display of gestures matter. Not grand promises."" 
My view has been-
What ultimately matters is keeping genuine grand promises. It won't be there until there's deep emotion and the person is really special.
And, when it comes to the consistency in the display of small gestures, as long as one's in the real world, it changes depending on how favourable/unfavourable the situation is. Also, without the presence of those genuine grand promises, it could be totally fake too; just a formality.
This view made me hurt you; lose you. I took it for granted that you would understand this temporary unfavourable situation.

The way you saw it- ""I'm an unwelcome person among his family. He has to 'obey' their commands. And doesn't give a fuck about what I'm going through. He will always behave like this before them. Also, he got too busy with the responsibilities and affairs at home, and I feel like a stupid, without any self-respect, waiting for his calls.""

But the reality from my side was- ""She (You) is the centre of my world. The person I've assigned the meaning of my life to. (I'll not say it out loud to not scare her away. Even when she says, ""Abhishek, I'm not sure of the future."", it doesn't matter. It's too late now. She's already become an inseparable part of me. So, now I'll just nod my head and play along.) She's the only person I feel true happiness around. I've been there for her, and will be again. These people at home are my responsibility. They've been hurt, they need and rely on me, so, I'll make them happy by giving them my time and energy. Even if they're immature at times, they are still my family. Also, for the time I'm under someone else's roof, I'll respect the vibe of that environment and avoid creating a ruckus. Why should I get into a huge fight with them over nothing? After all, it's temporary. She (You) will understand.""

M, I've a set of a thousand different personalities and behaviours for a thousand different situations. I could be a doormat or the person with extreme self-respect and integrity; a promise-breaker or someone who'll keep his words forever; a generous, kind, loving, forgiving, empathetic person or a brutal monstrous one. Depending on each specific situation; considering the POV of the people involved, my own emotions towards them, my own perspective, and what I want. You knew this about me, through all those thousands of hours of conversation. Yet, you wrongly assumed things, lost trust and feelings, and felt humiliated.

Remember the times you doubted whether you even want the relationship or not; the times you were scared of any commitment; the times you didn't feel anything; the times you just pretended to feel as deeply for me as I felt for you; the times you replied to me with equal intensity just because you felt it was the right thing to do, not because you actually felt the same; the times you didn't trust me; the times you were ""testing me"" by raising certain topics and letting me speak out my perspectives on that; the few times you imagined loss of self-respect, didn't want to seem needy, or simply needed me-time, and had to lie to me to avoid my calls- M, didn't you know me enough to know that I'm able to see through such things? Still, none of that mattered to me. As I already said, you were my own; my woman. And, all I knew was that there were hundreds of moments when you actually felt the most intense kind of love there could ever be for me. That's all that mattered to me. 

You already know the way the relationship market functions. They put a rating, an ""attractiveness score"", depending on the way you dress, walk and talk; the way your hair, skin, body figure looks like; where you stand on the funny/boring scale; how lively/sad you are; how soft-spoken or bold you are; how much aligned you are according to their needs and desires; and a hundred other parameters. They find certain aspects of you good, and then they have to force themselves to compromise with the rest. Or, they want someone having a higher ""score"", but if they can't have that, they'll just settle with you. And then, they dare to call this LOVE. For a few days, one will create a projection of you in their head, be smitten by you, and then, they get bored, lose the excitement and the attraction. They start finding certain aspects of you annoying, comparing you with others, and trying to change you.

IT'S NOT WRONG. It's just how the people, regardless of gender, work. (Whatever psychological, behavioural, biological and evolutionary reasons may be at work behind it.)
BUT, IT'S NOT LOVE AS WELL.
This idea of real love has been, and will always be mythical. As long as people and society have the idea of ""good"" and ""bad"", and feel attraction towards the ""good"" while being unattracted (maybe even repulsed) by the ""bad"", real love will never exist. Topper is good/attractive, failure is bad/unattractive. Smooth skin is good, skin with a scar or a pimple is bad. Soft hair is good, coarse hair is unattractive. Fame is good, and the unknown is bad. A fluent, confident voice is good; stutter is a turn-off. Good English and accent are attractive, bad English is repulsive. The brain is hardwired this way, and the hormones work automatically, and the people work on auto-mode to get attracted or turned off. A corporate husband would believe he loves and cares about his wife a lot, but would feel embarrassed to bring her before his colleagues if she's not ""refined/elite"" enough. A wife would think she really loves her husband a lot, but the moment she meets her friend whose husband is much better looking or at a much higher position, she'd be envious or embarrassed. People can never love one for the person they are. They just compromise with the ""bad/unattractive"" part and settle for the person they can actually get. The things they didn't find in the person they're with, they'll make up for that by fantasizing about other people. Maybe certain celebrities, certain characters from the movies, someone at their work, someone in their circle, random people they see or read about online, or, random people they meet on the flight.

Khair, mera point ye hai ki agar tumhein sach mein wo mythical love chahiye, tab waapas laut aao. I do and will always love you this way. You have been and still are the ONLY woman I want to tightly hold close to myself and kiss.

Every time I make myself a cup of sugarless intense coffee shots, I think of you. I feel extremely desolate each time mother or Ankita asks about you. I love to brag about how beautiful you are to my cousins. I think of your quivering lips when I saw you for the first time, your square glasses, and your braided hair. When I see anything related to MBTI (and INTP), I think about you. (BTW, I found it interesting that Dostoevsky, who you love, was of the same type as me (who you once loved).

I know it rarely works. Still, I want to apologise, explain, and request you to come back. After all, you did love me to an unimaginable extent.

The ONLY thing I need/needed from you is that you should be attracted to me as if I'm the ONLY man in the world for you- not just visibly through words and gestures, but even in your deepest fantasies; and not force yourself to make compromises, not just settle for some other qualities I possess. This is the ONLY ""condition"" I had/have. Why else do you think I don't give/never gave a fuck about selling myself in the relationship and marriage market of the world?

Anyway, if you believe you are that person, the way I imagined you, come back. NO ONE in the world can understand you as deeply as I. NO MAN can love you as much as I do.

So here’s the deal. Last Monday, I caught myself staring at my endless to-do list like a deer in headlights. I felt that all-too-familiar cortisol rush—like my body's way of yelling, ""Hey, maybe two cups of coffee was a bad idea!"" 🙈 With my productivity in jeopardy, I decided to test something new... *box breathing*. Yep, the technique the Navy SEALs swear by! Curious?

**Here's how my weeklong experiment went:**

- **Day 1: The Awkward Turtle 🐢**  
  Took my first box breath; 4 seconds inhale, hold, exhale, hold. Repeat. My brain kept wandering to Netflix and yesterday's email. (You can relate, right?)

- **Day 3: Blossoming Serenity 🌿**  
  As I got used to the breathwork, I felt like a Zen monk—well, a monk with a I-just-ate-chocolate level of Zen. Fewer racing thoughts, deeper concentration. Hallelujah!

- **Day 5: Slow-mo Mastery 🎬**  
  Meetings didn't feel like Armageddon, and emails felt less... eeky. 🤔 Was it possible I'd found an oasis in my mental desert?

- **Day 7: Calm Focus Unleashed! 🚀**  
  I felt *empowered*. Tasks were tackled with a clear head. Shoulders relaxed. Cortisol? More like cortisu-gone. Ok, that was cringe. But you get it!

**So, why box breathing?** It's like giving your nervous system a warm hug. Science backs it up—regulates stress responses with those neat-o breath patterns.

But hey, it’s not just the stress-busting perks. I loved how it became my mindfulness snack, sprinkled throughout busy days. Who said you can't have productivity with a side of tranquility?

**Now, over to you guys**—what’s your go-to stress buster? Have you tried variations of mindful breathing, or got other hacks to share? Dive in with me and let's create a toolbox for the high-achievers who, like us, could use a breather. 😉

So I had a mostly peaceful shift until I encountered a semi-recurring customer with a small-ish service dog (I won't doxx the dog bc they didn't do anything wrong to me) with white curly fur. 

Elderly AH decided to open her transaction with me by asking in her own way if I was sleepy. I know this bc she ALWAYS asks me this every time I ring her up. I could have decided to refuse her but so far she hasn't done anything to piss me off. So I responded with ""Come up with better material, lady- it's not funny"". So she was quiet for a few more seconds until she asked me again. I apologized for my remark and begrudgingly rung her up until I handed over her change and reciept. Meanwhile her service doggo wandered off and Elderly AH decided to throw a hissy fit over the dirty dollar I gave her. 

So I ended up having to borrow my supervisor's card so I can exchange the dirty dollar she didn't want. Elderly AH didn't thank me and fucked off- and she knew that I hated that jab towards my eyes and is most likely aware of me getting fired if I tried anything. I also asked my coworkers if I looked sleepy after the transaction and unfortunately, I did look sleepy even with coffee. 

On a side note, I ended up having to tell my next several customers that my tired/sleepy/angry face looks the same and is my default face. 

I also forgot I can indeed refuse customers but I'm not able to refuse customers for being AH bc some of those times were when I was being an AH bc of my rbf. ",15,1751512412.0,retailhell,1,1.0,False

According to the manufacturer, Tea Burn’s unique formulation contains natural ingredients that work together to boost metabolism, suppress appetite, and provide long-lasting energy, all while burning fat.

# How Does Tea Burn Work?

Tea Burn works by using a proprietary blend of ingredients that work synergistically to support your body’s fat-burning mechanisms. The idea behind this supplement is that tea, especially green tea, is already known for its metabolism-boosting properties. Tea Burn aims to amplify those benefits by introducing ingredients that enhance the effects of the tea you’re drinking.

Here’s how Tea Burn works step-by-step:

* **Boosts Metabolism**: The ingredients in Tea Burn are designed to increase your metabolic rate, allowing your body to burn more calories, even at rest.
* **Thermogenesis**: Tea Burn promotes thermogenesis, a process where the body produces heat, burning more calories in the process.
* **Appetite Suppression**: By reducing your hunger and cravings, Tea Burn helps you consume fewer calories throughout the day, contributing to a calorie deficit.
* **Energy Boost**: Tea Burn also contains ingredients that provide a clean energy boost without the jittery feeling often associated with other weight loss supplements.
* **Fat Oxidation**: By enhancing fat oxidation, Tea Burn helps your body utilize stored fat for energy.

# Ingredients in Tea Burn

Tea Burn’s formula is made up of a few key ingredients, all of which are backed by research for their ability to support weight loss. Let’s take a closer look at each ingredient:

# 1. Green Tea Extract

Green tea is one of the most popular ingredients in weight loss supplements, and for good reason. It’s packed with antioxidants, particularly EGCG (Epigallocatechin gallate), which has been shown to boost metabolism and enhance fat burning. Studies suggest that EGCG helps increase the breakdown of fat in your body, allowing it to be used as energy more efficiently.

**Research Insight**: Studies have found that green tea extract can boost calorie burning by 4% and fat oxidation by 17%, even at rest.

[**👉Click here✅ to Buy Tea Burn's Official website** ](https://6e539le1e6jbet5lq9rly9fl67.hop.clickbank.net/) 

# 2. L-Theanine

L-Theanine is an amino acid commonly found in tea leaves. It’s known for promoting relaxation and reducing stress levels. One of the key reasons this ingredient is included in Tea Burn is because stress and high cortisol levels can lead to weight gain, especially in the abdominal area. By promoting a calm and relaxed state, L-Theanine helps balance your hormones and can indirectly support weight loss.

**Research Insight**: A 2016 study found that L-Theanine, in combination with caffeine, can lead to enhanced cognitive performance and improved fat oxidation during exercise.

# 3. Chromium

Chromium is an essential mineral that plays a role in regulating blood sugar levels. By maintaining stable blood sugar levels, chromium helps prevent cravings and hunger spikes that can lead to overeating. It also helps your body metabolize fats and carbohydrates more efficiently, further supporting your weight loss goals.

**Research Insight**: Research shows that chromium supplementation can reduce body fat and promote lean muscle mass in individuals trying to lose weight.

# 4. Caffeine

Caffeine is a well-known stimulant that increases metabolism and enhances fat burning. It also provides an energy boost, helping you stay active and focused throughout the day. In combination with the other ingredients in Tea Burn, caffeine helps you stay energized and burn more calories, even during workouts.

**Research Insight**: A 2019 study in the *American Journal of Clinical Nutrition* found that caffeine increases fat oxidation by 10-29%, depending on the individual’s body fat percentage.

# 5. Chlorogenic Acid

Chlorogenic acid is found in coffee beans and is known for its fat-burning properties. It helps to slow the absorption of carbohydrates in the gut, which reduces blood sugar spikes and can prevent fat storage. Chlorogenic acid also promotes fat breakdown and helps regulate cholesterol levels, further aiding weight loss.

**Research Insight**: A 2020 study showed that participants who took chlorogenic acid experienced significant weight loss and reduced body fat compared to the control group.

A few months ago, I was stuck in a rut, feeling sluggish, battling with my weight, and losing confidence with every glance in the mirror. No matter how hard I tried to stick to a strict diet or push through another grueling workout, the results just weren’t showing. I needed something to kickstart my journey—something to give me that edge—and that’s when I found Tea Burn.

[**👉Click here✅ to Buy Tea Burn's Official website** ](https://6e539le1e6jbet5lq9rly9fl67.hop.clickbank.net/) 

At first, I was skeptical. We’ve all seen products promising miracle results, right? But something about Tea Burn stood out. Maybe it was the simplicity—a tasteless powder you can add to your tea? No fuss, no drama. It seemed too good to be true. But the reviews were glowing, and people were raving about how Tea Burn had helped them finally shed those stubborn pounds. I decided to give it a shot.

The first week of using Tea Burn was eye-opening. I started mixing it with my morning tea, as suggested, and immediately noticed a difference. My energy levels shot through the roof. I didn’t feel jittery or over-caffeinated; instead, it was this steady, consistent energy that carried me through the day. Suddenly, I wasn’t dragging myself to work or needing that mid-afternoon nap. Tea Burn became the fuel I didn’t know I was missing.

And then, the real magic started. Within two weeks, I noticed my clothes fitting better. My face started to look slimmer, and the stubborn fat around my belly—my biggest problem area—began to shrink. I wasn’t just losing weight; I was gaining confidence. For the first time in years, I felt like I was in control of my body.

What amazed me most about Tea Burn was how easy it was to incorporate into my life. I didn’t have to overhaul my routine or follow some complicated regimen. One simple packet a day, mixed with my tea, and I was good to go. I even started looking forward to my tea time—it became a small but significant ritual that set the tone for the rest of my day.

The ingredients in Tea Burn are the real deal. The green tea extract, green coffee bean extract, and L-carnitine worked together like a dream team, boosting my metabolism and helping me burn fat without feeling like I was depriving myself. The L-theanine kept me calm and focused, while the chromium helped curb those pesky sugar cravings that used to derail my progress. Everything about Tea Burn just made sense, and it delivered on every promise.

# Tea Burn Ingredients

The magic behind Tea Burn lies in its ingredients. Each one plays a vital role in helping you lose weight and feel better than ever. When I first looked into the components, I was impressed by how thoughtfully they were chosen. These aren’t just random fillers—they’re scientifically backed ingredients that work together to support fat burning, boost energy, and improve overall health. Let me break down how they’ve helped me transform my body and my life.

First up is **green tea extract**, which is the cornerstone of Tea Burn’s formula. Green tea is well-known for its ability to boost metabolism, thanks to its rich supply of catechins and caffeine. These compounds work together to increase your body’s ability to burn fat, especially during exercise. I noticed that within days of starting Tea Burn, I felt more energetic and lighter, and I’m certain green tea extract played a big part in that. It felt like my body’s engine was running smoother, burning calories even when I wasn’t actively working out.

Then there’s **green coffee bean extract**, another powerhouse ingredient. This contains chlorogenic acid, which has been shown to reduce the absorption of carbohydrates in the digestive tract. In simpler terms, it helps your body process food more efficiently, so fewer calories turn into fat. For someone like me who used to struggle with stubborn weight around my midsection, this was a game-changer. Green coffee bean extract doesn’t just burn fat—it helps prevent it from forming in the first place.

**L-carnitine** is the ingredient that gives Tea Burn an extra edge. This amino acid is like a personal chauffeur for your body’s fat stores, transporting fatty acids to the mitochondria, where they’re burned for energy. The result? Not only does L-carnitine help you burn fat, but it also gives you a noticeable energy boost. I used to hit an energy wall by mid-afternoon, but with Tea Burn, I found I could power through my day with ease. It’s a small shift that makes a huge difference.

The inclusion of **L-theanine** was a pleasant surprise. It’s not just about losing weight—Tea Burn helps you feel good while you’re doing it. L-theanine, an amino acid found in tea leaves, promotes relaxation without making you feel drowsy. When combined with caffeine, it provides a smooth, balanced energy that keeps you alert and focused. This meant no more energy crashes or jittery feelings, which was a massive win for me.

Finally, there’s **chromium**, the unsung hero of Tea Burn. This essential mineral is often overlooked, but it’s a game-changer when it comes to curbing cravings. Chromium helps regulate blood sugar levels, which in turn reduces those uncontrollable sugar and carb cravings that can derail your progress. For someone who used to give in to afternoon sweets almost daily, this was life-changing. Tea Burn didn’t just help me lose weight—it helped me gain control over my eating habits.

What I love most about Tea Burn is how these ingredients work in harmony. It’s not just about losing weight—it’s about creating a healthy, sustainable lifestyle. I didn’t feel like I was forcing my body into overdrive; instead, it felt like Tea Burn was gently nudging it in the right direction, helping me achieve my goals without stress or struggle.

As the weeks went by, the results spoke for themselves. The weight I’d been trying to lose for years finally started to melt away. I felt more energetic, more focused, and more in control than ever before. And it wasn’t just physical changes—I felt a shift in my mindset, too. Tea Burn gave me the confidence to believe in myself and my ability to stick to a healthier routine.

The best part? Tea Burn’s ingredients are all-natural, which gave me peace of mind knowing I wasn’t putting anything harmful into my body. It’s a clean, effective formula that delivers on its promises. Whether you’re just starting your weight loss journey or looking to break through a plateau, Tea Burn is the perfect ally to have in your corner. It worked wonders for me, and I’m confident it can do the same for you.

Does Tea Burn Work?

The effectiveness of Tea Burn lies in its unique formulation, which combines scientifically proven ingredients that work synergistically to enhance metabolism and promote fat burning. Each ingredient has been selected for its specific benefits, making Tea Burn a comprehensive solution for those looking to lose weight.

Research suggests that the primary ingredients in Tea Burn, such as Chlorogenic Acid and Camellia Sinensis, play a significant role in metabolic enhancement. Chlorogenic Acid, found in coffee beans and certain teas, has been shown to help reduce fat accumulation and improve insulin sensitivity. This means that individuals taking Tea Burn may experience a more efficient metabolism, leading to increased fat oxidation and weight loss.

Furthermore, Camellia Sinensis, the source of green tea extract, is renowned for its thermogenic properties. This ingredient helps elevate body temperature slightly, which can lead to increased calorie expenditure. Studies have shown that regular consumption of green tea can result in significant fat loss, particularly in the abdominal area. By incorporating this powerful ingredient, Tea Burn maximizes the fat-burning potential of your daily tea consumption.

In addition to its primary ingredients, Tea Burn includes L-Carnitine and Chromium, both of which are known for their weight loss benefits. L-Carnitine aids in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they are burned for energy. This process not only helps in weight loss but also increases energy levels, allowing users to maintain an active lifestyle. Chromium, on the other hand, regulates blood sugar levels, reducing cravings and promoting a feeling of fullness, which can further support weight management efforts.

Real user testimonials also support the effectiveness of Tea Burn. Many individuals have reported significant weight loss results after incorporating this product into their daily routine. Users often describe feeling more energized and less hungry throughout the day, which contributes to better dietary choices and overall health.

Overall, Tea Burn appears to work effectively for those looking to enhance their weight loss journey. Its scientifically-backed ingredients, combined with positive user experiences, suggest that when used consistently in conjunction with a balanced diet and regular exercise, Tea Burn can be a valuable tool in achieving weight loss goals.

What are the Ingredients in Tea Burn?

Chlorogenic Acid

Chlorogenic Acid is a natural compound found in coffee beans and certain teas that has gained attention for its weight loss properties. Research indicates that Chlorogenic Acid can help reduce the absorption of carbohydrates from the digestive tract, leading to lower blood sugar levels. This regulation of blood sugar is essential for preventing insulin spikes, which can contribute to fat storage. Additionally, Chlorogenic Acid has antioxidant properties that help combat oxidative stress in the body, promoting overall health and well-being. Its ability to enhance fat metabolism makes it a crucial ingredient in Tea Burn, supporting users in their weight loss journey.

Camellia Sinensis

Camellia Sinensis, commonly known as the tea plant, is the source of various tea types, including green, black, and oolong tea. This powerful ingredient is rich in catechins, a type of antioxidant that has been linked to increased fat burning and improved metabolic rates. Studies have shown that regular consumption of green tea, which is high in Camellia Sinensis, can lead to significant weight loss and fat reduction. The thermogenic properties of Camellia Sinensis help elevate body temperature, which can increase calorie expenditure. Furthermore, it supports cardiovascular health and cognitive function, making it a vital component of Tea Burn's formulation.

Chromium

Chromium is an essential trace mineral that plays a critical role in carbohydrate and fat metabolism. It enhances the action of insulin, which is important for maintaining healthy blood sugar levels. By improving insulin sensitivity, Chromium helps to regulate appetite and reduce cravings, making it easier for individuals to adhere to their dietary goals. Several studies suggest that Chromium supplementation can lead to modest weight loss, particularly in individuals with insulin resistance. In Tea Burn, Chromium's inclusion not only supports weight management but also promotes overall metabolic health, making it a valuable ingredient for users.

L-Carnitine

L-Carnitine is an amino acid derivative that is essential for the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they are burned for energy. This process is crucial for effective fat metabolism, as it helps the body utilize stored fat as a source of energy. L-Carnitine has been widely studied for its role in weight loss, particularly in individuals looking to enhance their physical performance. By increasing the body's ability to burn fat, L-Carnitine can contribute to improved energy levels and endurance during workouts. In Tea Burn, L-Carnitine aids in maximizing the fat-burning potential of the other ingredients, supporting users in their weight loss efforts.

L-Theanine

L-Theanine is an amino acid primarily found in green tea, known for its calming effects and ability to promote relaxation without causing drowsiness. This ingredient is particularly important for individuals who may experience anxiety or stress while trying to lose weight. By enhancing mood and reducing stress, L-Theanine can help users make healthier food choices and stick to their diet plans. Additionally, L-Theanine works synergistically with caffeine, which is often present in tea, to improve cognitive function and focus. In Tea Burn, L-Theanine contributes to a balanced approach to weight loss by promoting mental clarity and reducing stress-related cravings.

Vitamin Complex

The Vitamin Complex in Tea Burn includes essential vitamins that support overall health and well-being. Vitamins play a crucial role in various bodily functions, including metabolism, energy production, and immune function. By incorporating a blend of vitamins, Tea Burn not only aids in weight loss but also promotes overall health. For instance, B vitamins are vital for energy metabolism, helping the body convert food into usable energy. Vitamins also support immune health, ensuring that users feel their best while on their weight loss journey. The inclusion of a Vitamin Complex in Tea Burn enhances its effectiveness, making it a comprehensive solution for those looking to improve their health and achieve their weight loss goals.

Tea Burn Science

The science behind Tea Burn is grounded in the research surrounding its key ingredients and their effects on weight loss and metabolic health. Studies have demonstrated that the individual components of Tea Burn, such as Chlorogenic Acid and Camellia Sinensis, possess significant fat-burning properties. For instance, research indicates that Chlorogenic Acid can inhibit glucose absorption in the intestines, which not only helps regulate blood sugar levels but also reduces fat accumulation.

Similarly, Camellia Sinensis is rich in catechins, which are known to enhance thermogenesis-the process by which the body generates heat and burns calories. Numerous studies have shown that green tea extract, which contains high levels of catechins, can lead to increased fat oxidation during exercise and at rest. This means that individuals who consume Tea Burn can potentially experience enhanced fat burning both during physical activity and throughout their daily routines.

The metabolic benefits of L-Carnitine are also well-documented. Research has shown that L-Carnitine can increase the amount of fat burned during exercise, contributing to improved weight loss outcomes. Additionally, studies suggest that L-Carnitine supplementation can enhance exercise performance, making it easier for individuals to engage in physical activity, which is essential for successful weight management.

Furthermore, the combination of L-Theanine with caffeine, commonly found in tea, has been shown to improve cognitive function and focus while also reducing the jitters often associated with caffeine consumption. This synergy can lead to better adherence to diet and exercise programs, as individuals are more likely to remain motivated and engaged in their weight loss journey.

Overall, the scientific evidence supporting the ingredients in Tea Burn validates its effectiveness as a weight loss support option. By leveraging the metabolic-enhancing properties of its components, Tea Burn offers users a natural and effective way to achieve their weight loss goals.

A faster metabolism also translates to higher energy levels, which can encourage a more active lifestyle and further support weight loss efforts.

Weight Management Support

Tea Burn provides effective support for weight management through its carefully selected ingredients.

Many individuals struggle with hunger pangs and unhealthy cravings, but Tea Burn's formulation addresses these challenges, allowing for a more sustainable approach to weight loss.

This boost in energy can enhance physical performance and encourage a more active lifestyle, further supporting weight loss goals.

Does Tea Burn Work?

The effectiveness of Tea Burn lies in its unique formulation, which combines scientifically proven ingredients that work synergistically to enhance metabolism and promote fat burning. Each ingredient has been selected for its specific benefits, making Tea Burn a comprehensive solution for those looking to lose weight.

Research suggests that the primary ingredients in Tea Burn, such as Chlorogenic Acid and Camellia Sinensis, play a significant role in metabolic enhancement. Chlorogenic Acid, found in coffee beans and certain teas, has been shown to help reduce fat accumulation and improve insulin sensitivity. This means that individuals taking Tea Burn may experience a more efficient metabolism, leading to increased fat oxidation and weight loss.

Furthermore, Camellia Sinensis, the source of green tea extract, is renowned for its thermogenic properties. This ingredient helps elevate body temperature slightly, which can lead to increased calorie expenditure. Studies have shown that regular consumption of green tea can result in significant fat loss, particularly in the abdominal area. By incorporating this powerful ingredient, Tea Burn maximizes the fat-burning potential of your daily tea consumption.

In addition to its primary ingredients, Tea Burn includes L-Carnitine and Chromium, both of which are known for their weight loss benefits. L-Carnitine aids in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they are burned for energy. This process not only helps in weight loss but also increases energy levels, allowing users to maintain an active lifestyle. Chromium, on the other hand, regulates blood sugar levels, reducing cravings and promoting a feeling of fullness, which can further support weight management efforts.

Real user testimonials also support the effectiveness of Tea Burn. Many individuals have reported significant weight loss results after incorporating this product into their daily routine. Users often describe feeling more energized and less hungry throughout the day, which contributes to better dietary choices and overall health.

Overall, Tea Burn appears to work effectively for those looking to enhance their weight loss journey. Its scientifically-backed ingredients, combined with positive user experiences, suggest that when used consistently in conjunction with a balanced diet and regular exercise, Tea Burn can be a valuable tool in achieving weight loss goals.

Tea Burn Real Customer Reviews and Testimonials

Many users report noticeable changes within weeks of starting Tea Burn. Some testimonials include comments about increased energy levels, reduced cravings, and overall improved well-being. For instance, one user stated, ""I started using Tea Burn a month ago, and I've already lost 10 pounds! I love how I can just add it to my morning tea without any extra effort.

Feel the energy, drop the pounds-Tea Burn helps you power through your day and your goals.

What are the Ingredients in Tea Burn?

Chlorogenic Acid

Chlorogenic Acid is a natural compound found in coffee beans and certain teas that has gained attention for its weight loss properties. Research indicates that Chlorogenic Acid can help reduce the absorption of carbohydrates from the digestive tract, leading to lower blood sugar levels. This regulation of blood sugar is essential for preventing insulin spikes, which can contribute to fat storage. Additionally, Chlorogenic Acid has antioxidant properties that help combat oxidative stress in the body, promoting overall health and well-being. Its ability to enhance fat metabolism makes it a crucial ingredient in Tea Burn, supporting users in their weight loss journey.

Camellia Sinensis

Camellia Sinensis, commonly known as the tea plant, is the source of various tea types, including green, black, and oolong tea. This powerful ingredient is rich in catechins, a type of antioxidant that has been linked to increased fat burning and improved metabolic rates. Studies have shown that regular consumption of green tea, which is high in Camellia Sinensis, can lead to significant weight loss and fat reduction. The thermogenic properties of Camellia Sinensis help elevate body temperature, which can increase calorie expenditure. Furthermore, it supports cardiovascular health and cognitive function, making it a vital component of Tea Burn's formulation.

Chromium

Chromium is an essential trace mineral that plays a critical role in carbohydrate and fat metabolism. It enhances the action of insulin, which is important for maintaining healthy blood sugar levels. By improving insulin sensitivity, Chromium helps to regulate appetite and reduce cravings, making it easier for individuals to adhere to their dietary goals. Several studies suggest that Chromium supplementation can lead to modest weight loss, particularly in individuals with insulin resistance. In Tea Burn, Chromium's inclusion not only supports weight management but also promotes overall metabolic health, making it a valuable ingredient for users.

L-Carnitine

L-Carnitine is an amino acid derivative that is essential for the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they are burned for energy. This process is crucial for effective fat metabolism, as it helps the body utilize stored fat as a source of energy. L-Carnitine has been widely studied for its role in weight loss, particularly in individuals looking to enhance their physical performance. By increasing the body's ability to burn fat, L-Carnitine can contribute to improved energy levels and endurance during workouts. In Tea Burn, L-Carnitine aids in maximizing the fat-burning potential of the other ingredients, supporting users in their weight loss efforts.

L-Theanine

L-Theanine is an amino acid primarily found in green tea, known for its calming effects and ability to promote relaxation without causing drowsiness. This ingredient is particularly important for individuals who may experience anxiety or stress while trying to lose weight. By enhancing mood and reducing stress, L-Theanine can help users make healthier food choices and stick to their diet plans. Additionally, L-Theanine works synergistically with caffeine, which is often present in tea, to improve cognitive function and focus. In Tea Burn, L-Theanine contributes to a balanced approach to weight loss by promoting mental clarity and reducing stress-related cravings.

Vitamin Complex

The Vitamin Complex in Tea Burn includes essential vitamins that support overall health and well-being. Vitamins play a crucial role in various bodily functions, including metabolism, energy production, and immune function. By incorporating a blend of vitamins, Tea Burn not only aids in weight loss but also promotes overall health. For instance, B vitamins are vital for energy metabolism, helping the body convert food into usable energy. Vitamins also support immune health, ensuring that users feel their best while on their weight loss journey. The inclusion of a Vitamin Complex in Tea Burn enhances its effectiveness, making it a comprehensive solution for those looking to improve their health and achieve their weight loss goals.

Tea Burn Science

The science behind Tea Burn is grounded in the research surrounding its key ingredients and their effects on weight loss and metabolic health. Studies have demonstrated that the individual components of Tea Burn, such as Chlorogenic Acid and Camellia Sinensis, possess significant fat-burning properties. For instance, research indicates that Chlorogenic Acid can inhibit glucose absorption in the intestines, which not only helps regulate blood sugar levels but also reduces fat accumulation.

Similarly, Camellia Sinensis is rich in catechins, which are known to enhance thermogenesis-the process by which the body generates heat and burns calories. Numerous studies have shown that green tea extract, which contains high levels of catechins, can lead to increased fat oxidation during exercise and at rest. This means that individuals who consume Tea Burn can potentially experience enhanced fat burning both during physical activity and throughout their daily routines.

The metabolic benefits of L-Carnitine are also well-documented. Research has shown that L-Carnitine can increase the amount of fat burned during exercise, contributing to improved weight loss outcomes. Additionally, studies suggest that L-Carnitine supplementation can enhance exercise performance, making it easier for individuals to engage in physical activity, which is essential for successful weight management.

Furthermore, the combination of L-Theanine with caffeine, commonly found in tea, has been shown to improve cognitive function and focus while also reducing the jitters often associated with caffeine consumption. This synergy can lead to better adherence to diet and exercise programs, as individuals are more likely to remain motivated and engaged in their weight loss journey.

Overall, the scientific evidence supporting the ingredients in Tea Burn validates its effectiveness as a weight loss support option. By leveraging the metabolic-enhancing properties of its components, Tea Burn offers users a natural and effective way to achieve their weight loss goals.

Tea Burn Benefits

Enhanced Metabolism

One of the primary benefits of Tea Burn is its ability to enhance metabolism. The combination of Chlorogenic Acid and Camellia Sinensis works to increase metabolic rates, allowing the body to burn calories more efficiently. This increased metabolic activity means that users can enjoy their favorite tea while actively promoting fat burning throughout the day. A faster metabolism also translates to higher energy levels, which can encourage a more active lifestyle and further support weight loss efforts.

Weight Management Support

Tea Burn provides effective support for weight management through its carefully selected ingredients. Chromium and L-Carnitine work together to regulate blood sugar levels and enhance fat metabolism, respectively. This combination helps to curb cravings and promote a feeling of fullness, making it easier for users to stick to their dietary goals. Many individuals struggle with hunger pangs and unhealthy cravings, but Tea Burn's formulation addresses these challenges, allowing for a more sustainable approach to weight loss.

Increased Energy Levels

Users of Tea Burn often report increased energy levels, which can be attributed to the synergistic effects of its ingredients. L-Carnitine is known for its ability to boost energy by facilitating the use of fat as an energy source. Additionally, the presence of L-Theanine helps to promote mental clarity and focus, allowing individuals to feel energized without the jitters commonly associated with high-caffeine products. This boost in energy can enhance physical performance and encourage a more active lifestyle, further supporting weight loss goals.

Improved Mood and Reduced Stress

The calming effects of L-Theanine play a significant role in promoting overall well-being while on a weight loss journey.

Does Tea Burn Work?

The effectiveness of Tea Burn lies in its unique formulation, which combines scientifically proven ingredients that work synergistically to enhance metabolism and promote fat burning. Each ingredient has been selected for its specific benefits, making Tea Burn a comprehensive solution for those looking to lose weight.

Research suggests that the primary ingredients in Tea Burn, such as Chlorogenic Acid and Camellia Sinensis, play a significant role in metabolic enhancement. Chlorogenic Acid, found in coffee beans and certain teas, has been shown to help reduce fat accumulation and improve insulin sensitivity. This means that individuals taking Tea Burn may experience a more efficient metabolism, leading to increased fat oxidation and weight loss.

Furthermore, Camellia Sinensis, the source of green tea extract, is renowned for its thermogenic properties. This ingredient helps elevate body temperature slightly, which can lead to increased calorie expenditure. Studies have shown that regular consumption of green tea can result in significant fat loss, particularly in the abdominal area. By incorporating this powerful ingredient, Tea Burn maximizes the fat-burning potential of your daily tea consumption.

In addition to its primary ingredients, Tea Burn includes L-Carnitine and Chromium, both of which are known for their weight loss benefits. L-Carnitine aids in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they are burned for energy. This process not only helps in weight loss but also increases energy levels, allowing users to maintain an active lifestyle. Chromium, on the other hand, regulates blood sugar levels, reducing cravings and promoting a feeling of fullness, which can further support weight management efforts.

Real user testimonials also support the effectiveness of Tea Burn. Many individuals have reported significant weight loss results after incorporating this product into their daily routine. Users often describe feeling more energized and less hungry throughout the day, which contributes to better dietary choices and overall health.

Overall, Tea Burn appears to work effectively for those looking to enhance their weight loss journey. Its scientifically-backed ingredients, combined with positive user experiences, suggest that when used consistently in conjunction with a balanced diet and regular exercise, Tea Burn can be a valuable tool in achieving weight loss goals.

Tea Burn Real Customer Reviews and Testimonials

What are the Ingredients in Tea Burn?

Chlorogenic Acid

Chlorogenic Acid is a natural compound found in coffee beans and certain teas that has gained attention for its weight loss properties. Research indicates that Chlorogenic Acid can help reduce the absorption of carbohydrates from the digestive tract, leading to lower blood sugar levels. This regulation of blood sugar is essential for preventing insulin spikes, which can contribute to fat storage. Additionally, Chlorogenic Acid has antioxidant properties that help combat oxidative stress in the body, promoting overall health and well-being. Its ability to enhance fat metabolism makes it a crucial ingredient in Tea Burn, supporting users in their weight loss journey.

Camellia Sinensis

Camellia Sinensis, commonly known as the tea plant, is the source of various tea types, including green, black, and oolong tea. This powerful ingredient is rich in catechins, a type of antioxidant that has been linked to increased fat burning and improved metabolic rates. Studies have shown that regular consumption of green tea, which is high in Camellia Sinensis, can lead to significant weight loss and fat reduction. The thermogenic properties of Camellia Sinensis help elevate body temperature, which can increase calorie expenditure. Furthermore, it supports cardiovascular health and cognitive function, making it a vital component of Tea Burn's formulation.

Chromium

Chromium is an essential trace mineral that plays a critical role in carbohydrate and fat metabolism. It enhances the action of insulin, which is important for maintaining healthy blood sugar levels. By improving insulin sensitivity, Chromium helps to regulate appetite and reduce cravings, making it easier for individuals to adhere to their dietary goals. Several studies suggest that Chromium supplementation can lead to modest weight loss, particularly in individuals with insulin resistance. In Tea Burn, Chromium's inclusion not only supports weight management but also promotes overall metabolic health, making it a valuable ingredient for users.

L-Carnitine

L-Carnitine is an amino acid derivative that is essential for the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they are burned for energy. This process is crucial for effective fat metabolism, as it helps the body utilize stored fat as a source of energy. L-Carnitine has been widely studied for its role in weight loss, particularly in individuals looking to enhance their physical performance. By increasing the body's ability to burn fat, L-Carnitine can contribute to improved energy levels and endurance during workouts. In Tea Burn, L-Carnitine aids in maximizing the fat-burning potential of the other ingredients, supporting users in their weight loss efforts.

L-Theanine

L-Theanine is an amino acid primarily found in green tea, known for its calming effects and ability to promote relaxation without causing drowsiness. This ingredient is particularly important for individuals who may experience anxiety or stress while trying to lose weight. By enhancing mood and reducing stress, L-Theanine can help users make healthier food choices and stick to their diet plans. Additionally, L-Theanine works synergistically with caffeine, which is often present in tea, to improve cognitive function and focus. In Tea Burn, L-Theanine contributes to a balanced approach to weight loss by promoting mental clarity and reducing stress-related cravings.

Vitamin Complex

The Vitamin Complex in Tea Burn includes essential vitamins that support overall health and well-being. Vitamins play a crucial role in various bodily functions, including metabolism, energy production, and immune function. By incorporating a blend of vitamins, Tea Burn not only aids in weight loss but also promotes overall health. For instance, B vitamins are vital for energy metabolism, helping the body convert food into usable energy. Vitamins also support immune health, ensuring that users feel their best while on their weight loss journey. The inclusion of a Vitamin Complex in Tea Burn enhances its effectiveness, making it a comprehensive solution for those looking to improve their health and achieve their weight loss goals.

Tea Burn Science

The science behind Tea Burn is grounded in the research surrounding its key ingredients and their effects on weight loss and metabolic health. Studies have demonstrated that the individual components of Tea Burn, such as Chlorogenic Acid and Camellia Sinensis, possess significant fat-burning properties. For instance, research indicates that Chlorogenic Acid can inhibit glucose absorption in the intestines, which not only helps regulate blood sugar levels but also reduces fat accumulation.

Similarly, Camellia Sinensis is rich in catechins, which are known to enhance thermogenesis-the process by which the body generates heat and burns calories. Numerous studies have shown that green tea extract, which contains high levels of catechins, can lead to increased fat oxidation during exercise and at rest. This means that individuals who consume Tea Burn can potentially experience enhanced fat burning both during physical activity and throughout their daily routines.

The metabolic benefits of L-Carnitine are also well-documented. Research has shown that L-Carnitine can increase the amount of fat burned during exercise, contributing to improved weight loss outcomes. Additionally, studies suggest that L-Carnitine supplementation can enhance exercise performance, making it easier for individuals to engage in physical activity, which is essential for successful weight management.

Furthermore, the combination of L-Theanine with caffeine, commonly found in tea, has been shown to improve cognitive function and focus while also reducing the jitters often associated with caffeine consumption. This synergy can lead to better adherence to diet and exercise programs, as individuals are more likely to remain motivated and engaged in their weight loss journey.

Overall, the scientific evidence supporting the ingredients in Tea Burn validates its effectiveness as a weight loss support option. By leveraging the metabolic-enhancing properties of its components, Tea Burn offers users a natural and effective way to achieve their weight loss goals.

Tea Burn Benefits

Enhanced Metabolism

One of the primary benefits of Tea Burn is its ability to enhance metabolism. The combination of Chlorogenic Acid and Camellia Sinensis works to increase metabolic rates, allowing the body to burn calories more efficiently. This increased metabolic activity means that users can enjoy their favorite tea while actively promoting fat burning throughout the day. A faster metabolism also translates to higher energy levels, which can encourage a more active lifestyle and further support weight loss efforts.

Weight Management Support

Tea Burn provides effective support for weight management through its carefully selected ingredients. Chromium and L-Carnitine work together to regulate blood sugar levels and enhance fat metabolism, respectively. This combination helps to curb cravings and promote a feeling of fullness, making it easier for users to stick to their dietary goals. Many individuals struggle with hunger pangs and unhealthy cravings, but Tea Burn's formulation addresses these challenges, allowing for a more sustainable approach to weight loss.

Increased Energy Levels

Users of Tea Burn often report increased energy levels, which can be attributed to the synergistic effects of its ingredients. L-Carnitine is known for its ability to boost energy by facilitating the use of fat as an energy source. Additionally, the presence of L-Theanine helps to promote mental clarity and focus, allowing individuals to feel energized without the jitters commonly associated with high-caffeine products. This boost in energy can enhance physical performance and encourage a more active lifestyle, further supporting weight loss goals.

Improved Mood and Reduced Stress

The calming effects of L-Theanine play a significant role in promoting overall well-being while on a weight loss journey.

Tea Burn's formulation leverages the fat-burning properties of its key ingredients, such as Chlorogenic Acid and Camellia Sinensis, to support weight loss. As studies indicate, these compounds can significantly enhance metabolic rates and improve fat oxidation. When users incorporate Tea Burn into their routine, they may experience increased energy levels and reduced appetite, both of which are crucial for maintaining a caloric deficit necessary for weight loss.

To maximize the benefits of Tea Burn, it is advisable for users to adopt a holistic approach to weight management. This includes eating a balanced diet rich in whole foods, engaging in regular physical activity, and staying hydrated. By making these lifestyle changes in conjunction with using Tea Burn, individuals can amplify their results and achieve their weight loss goals more effectively.

Moreover, the psychological aspect of weight loss should not be overlooked. Many users report feeling more motivated and focused when using Tea Burn, which can lead to better adherence to dietary and exercise programs. This emotional boost can be a powerful ally in the weight loss journey, helping individuals stay committed to their goals.

In conclusion, while Tea Burn can significantly aid in weight management, its true effectiveness is best realized when used alongside a healthy lifestyle. By combining the product with nutritious eating habits and regular exercise, users can unlock the full potential of Tea Burn and achieve lasting weight loss results.

Does Tea Burn Work?

The effectiveness of Tea Burn lies in its unique formulation, which combines scientifically proven ingredients that work synergistically to enhance metabolism and promote fat burning. Each ingredient has been selected for its specific benefits, making Tea Burn a comprehensive solution for those looking to lose weight.

Research suggests that the primary ingredients in Tea Burn, such as Chlorogenic Acid and Camellia Sinensis, play a significant role in metabolic enhancement. Chlorogenic Acid, found in coffee beans and certain teas, has been shown to help reduce fat accumulation and improve insulin sensitivity. This means that individuals taking Tea Burn may experience a more efficient metabolism, leading to increased fat oxidation and weight loss.

Furthermore, Camellia Sinensis, the source of green tea extract, is renowned for its thermogenic properties. This ingredient helps elevate body temperature slightly, which can lead to increased calorie expenditure. Studies have shown that regular consumption of green tea can result in significant fat loss, particularly in the abdominal area. By incorporating this powerful ingredient, Tea Burn maximizes the fat-burning potential of your daily tea consumption.

In addition to its primary ingredients, Tea Burn includes L-Carnitine and Chromium, both of which are known for their weight loss benefits. L-Carnitine aids in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they are burned for energy. This process not only helps in weight loss but also increases energy levels, allowing users to maintain an active lifestyle. Chromium, on the other hand, regulates blood sugar levels, reducing cravings and promoting a feeling of fullness, which can further support weight management efforts.

Real user testimonials also support the effectiveness of Tea Burn. Many individuals have reported significant weight loss results after incorporating this product into their daily routine. Users often describe feeling more energized and less hungry throughout the day, which contributes to better dietary choices and overall health.

Overall, Tea Burn appears to work effectively for those looking to enhance their weight loss journey. Its scientifically-backed ingredients, combined with positive user experiences, suggest that when used consistently in conjunction with a balanced diet and regular exercise, Tea Burn can be a valuable tool in achieving weight loss goals.

Feel the energy, drop the pounds-Tea Burn helps you power through your day and your goals.

What are the Ingredients in Tea Burn?

Chlorogenic Acid

Chlorogenic Acid is a natural compound found in coffee beans and certain teas that has gained attention for its weight loss properties. Research indicates that Chlorogenic Acid can help reduce the absorption of carbohydrates from the digestive tract, leading to lower blood sugar levels. This regulation of blood sugar is essential for preventing insulin spikes, which can contribute to fat storage. Additionally, Chlorogenic Acid has antioxidant properties that help combat oxidative stress in the body, promoting overall health and well-being. Its ability to enhance fat metabolism makes it a crucial ingredient in Tea Burn, supporting users in their weight loss journey.

Camellia Sinensis

Camellia Sinensis, commonly known as the tea plant, is the source of various tea types, including green, black, and oolong tea. This powerful ingredient is rich in catechins, a type of antioxidant that has been linked to increased fat burning and improved metabolic rates. Studies have shown that regular consumption of green tea, which is high in Camellia Sinensis, can lead to significant weight loss and fat reduction. The thermogenic properties of Camellia Sinensis help elevate body temperature, which can increase calorie expenditure. Furthermore, it supports cardiovascular health and cognitive function, making it a vital component of Tea Burn's formulation.

Chromium

Chromium is an essential trace mineral that plays a critical role in carbohydrate and fat metabolism. It enhances the action of insulin, which is important for maintaining healthy blood sugar levels. By improving insulin sensitivity, Chromium helps to regulate appetite and reduce cravings, making it easier for individuals to adhere to their dietary goals. Several studies suggest that Chromium supplementation can lead to modest weight loss, particularly in individuals with insulin resistance. In Tea Burn, Chromium's inclusion not only supports weight management but also promotes overall metabolic health, making it a valuable ingredient for users.

L-Carnitine

L-Carnitine is an amino acid derivative that is essential for the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they are burned for energy. This process is crucial for effective fat metabolism, as it helps the body utilize stored fat as a source of energy. L-Carnitine has been widely studied for its role in weight loss, particularly in individuals looking to enhance their physical performance. By increasing the body's ability to burn fat, L-Carnitine can contribute to improved energy levels and endurance during workouts. In Tea Burn, L-Carnitine aids in maximizing the fat-burning potential of the other ingredients, supporting users in their weight loss efforts.

L-Theanine

L-Theanine is an amino acid primarily found in green tea, known for its calming effects and ability to promote relaxation without causing drowsiness. This ingredient is particularly important for individuals who may experience anxiety or stress while trying to lose weight. By enhancing mood and reducing stress, L-Theanine can help users make healthier food choices and stick to their diet plans. Additionally, L-Theanine works synergistically with caffeine, which is often present in tea, to improve cognitive function and focus. In Tea Burn, L-Theanine contributes to a balanced approach to weight loss by promoting mental clarity and reducing stress-related cravings.

Vitamin Complex

The Vitamin Complex in Tea Burn includes essential vitamins that support overall health and well-being. Vitamins play a crucial role in various bodily functions, including metabolism, energy production, and immune function. By incorporating a blend of vitamins, Tea Burn not only aids in weight loss but also promotes overall health. For instance, B vitamins are vital for energy metabolism, helping the body convert food into usable energy. Vitamins also support immune health, ensuring that users feel their best while on their weight loss journey. The inclusion of a Vitamin Complex in Tea Burn enhances its effectiveness, making it a comprehensive solution for those looking to improve their health and achieve their weight loss goals.

Tea Burn Science

The science behind Tea Burn is grounded in the research surrounding its key ingredients and their effects on weight loss and metabolic health. Studies have demonstrated that the individual components of Tea Burn, such as Chlorogenic Acid and Camellia Sinensis, possess significant fat-burning properties. For instance, research indicates that Chlorogenic Acid can inhibit glucose absorption in the intestines, which not only helps regulate blood sugar levels but also reduces fat accumulation.

Similarly, Camellia Sinensis is rich in catechins, which are known to enhance thermogenesis-the process by which the body generates heat and burns calories. Numerous studies have shown that green tea extract, which contains high levels of catechins, can lead to increased fat oxidation during exercise and at rest. This means that individuals who consume Tea Burn can potentially experience enhanced fat burning both during physical activity and throughout their daily routines.

The metabolic benefits of L-Carnitine are also well-documented. Research has shown that L-Carnitine can increase the amount of fat burned during exercise, contributing to improved weight loss outcomes. Additionally, studies suggest that L-Carnitine supplementation can enhance exercise performance, making it easier for individuals to engage in physical activity, which is essential for successful weight management.

Furthermore, the combination of L-Theanine with caffeine, commonly found in tea, has been shown to improve cognitive function and focus while also reducing the jitters often associated with caffeine consumption. This synergy can lead to better adherence to diet and exercise programs, as individuals are more likely to remain motivated and engaged in their weight loss journey.

Overall, the scientific evidence supporting the ingredients in Tea Burn validates its effectiveness as a weight loss support option. By leveraging the metabolic-enhancing properties of its components, Tea Burn offers users a natural and effective way to achieve their weight loss goals.

Tea Burn Benefits

Enhanced Metabolism

One of the primary benefits of Tea Burn is its ability to enhance metabolism. The combination of Chlorogenic Acid and Camellia Sinensis works to increase metabolic rates, allowing the body to burn calories more efficiently. This increased metabolic activity means that users can enjoy their favorite tea while actively promoting fat burning throughout the day. A faster metabolism also translates to higher energy levels, which can encourage a more active lifestyle and further support weight loss efforts.

Weight Management Support

Tea Burn provides effective support for weight management through its carefully selected ingredients. Chromium and L-Carnitine work together to regulate blood sugar levels and enhance fat metabolism, respectively. This combination helps to curb cravings and promote a feeling of fullness, making it easier for users to stick to their dietary goals. Many individuals struggle with hunger pangs and unhealthy cravings, but Tea Burn's formulation addresses these challenges, allowing for a more sustainable approach to weight loss.

Increased Energy Levels

Users of Tea Burn often report increased energy levels, which can be attributed to the synergistic effects of its ingredients. L-Carnitine is known for its ability to boost energy by facilitating the use of fat as an energy source. Additionally, the presence of L-Theanine helps to promote mental clarity and focus, allowing individuals to feel energized without the jitters commonly associated with high-caffeine products. This boost in energy can enhance physical performance and encourage a more active lifestyle, further supporting weight loss goals.

Improved Mood and Reduced Stress

The calming effects of L-Theanine play a significant role in promoting overall well-being while on a weight loss journey. Stress and anxiety can lead to emotional eating and poor dietary choices, hindering progress. By incorporating L-Theanine, Tea Burn helps users maintain a balanced mood, reducing the likelihood of stress-related cravings. This emotional support is essential for those looking to adopt healthier habits and make lasting changes to their lifestyle.

Does Tea Burn Really Work?

The effectiveness of Tea Burn is rooted in its unique blend of scientifically supported ingredients designed to enhance metabolism and promote fat loss. However, it is essential to understand that supplements are most effective when combined with a healthy diet and regular exercise.

Tea Burn's formulation leverages the fat-burning properties of its key ingredients, such as Chlorogenic Acid and Camellia Sinensis, to support weight loss. As studies indicate, these compounds can significantly enhance metabolic rates and improve fat oxidation. When users incorporate Tea Burn into their routine, they may experience increased energy levels and reduced appetite, both of which are crucial for maintaining a caloric deficit necessary for weight loss.

To maximize the benefits of Tea Burn, it is advisable for users to adopt a holistic approach to weight management. This includes eating a balanced diet rich in whole foods, engaging in regular physical activity, and staying hydrated. By making these lifestyle changes in conjunction with using Tea Burn, individuals can amplify their results and achieve their weight loss goals more effectively.

Moreover, the psychological aspect of weight loss should not be overlooked. Many users report feeling more motivated and focused when using Tea Burn, which can lead to better adherence to dietary and exercise programs. This emotional boost can be a powerful ally in the weight loss journey, helping individuals stay committed to their goals.

Does Tea Burn Work?

The effectiveness of Tea Burn lies in its unique formulation, which combines scientifically proven ingredients that work synergistically to enhance metabolism and promote fat burning. Each ingredient has been selected for its specific benefits, making Tea Burn a comprehensive solution for those looking to lose weight.

Research suggests that the primary ingredients in Tea Burn, such as Chlorogenic Acid and Camellia Sinensis, play a significant role in metabolic enhancement. Chlorogenic Acid, found in coffee beans and certain teas, has been shown to help reduce fat accumulation and improve insulin sensitivity. This means that individuals taking Tea Burn may experience a more efficient metabolism, leading to increased fat oxidation and weight loss.

Furthermore, Camellia Sinensis, the source of green tea extract, is renowned for its thermogenic properties. This ingredient helps elevate body temperature slightly, which can lead to increased calorie expenditure. Studies have shown that regular consumption of green tea can result in significant fat loss, particularly in the abdominal area. By incorporating this powerful ingredient, Tea Burn maximizes the fat-burning potential of your daily tea consumption.

In addition to its primary ingredients, Tea Burn includes L-Carnitine and Chromium, both of which are known for their weight loss benefits. L-Carnitine aids in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they are burned for energy. This process not only helps in weight loss but also increases energy levels, allowing users to maintain an active lifestyle. Chromium, on the other hand, regulates blood sugar levels, reducing cravings and promoting a feeling of fullness, which can further support weight management efforts.

Real user testimonials also support the effectiveness of Tea Burn. Many individuals have reported significant weight loss results after incorporating this product into their daily routine. Users often describe feeling more energized and less hungry throughout the day, which contributes to better dietary choices and overall health.

Overall, Tea Burn appears to work effectively for those looking to enhance their weight loss journey. Its scientifically-backed ingredients, combined with positive user experiences, suggest that when used consistently in conjunction with a balanced diet and regular exercise, Tea Burn can be a valuable tool in achieving weight loss goals.

Tea Burn Real Customer Reviews and Testimonials

What are the Ingredients in Tea Burn?

Chlorogenic Acid

Chlorogenic Acid is a natural compound found in coffee beans and certain teas that has gained attention for its weight loss properties. Research indicates that Chlorogenic Acid can help reduce the absorption of carbohydrates from the digestive tract, leading to lower blood sugar levels. This regulation of blood sugar is essential for preventing insulin spikes, which can contribute to fat storage. Additionally, Chlorogenic Acid has antioxidant properties that help combat oxidative stress in the body, promoting overall health and well-being. Its ability to enhance fat metabolism makes it a crucial ingredient in Tea Burn, supporting users in their weight loss journey.

Camellia Sinensis

Camellia Sinensis, commonly known as the tea plant, is the source of various tea types, including green, black, and oolong tea. This powerful ingredient is rich in catechins, a type of antioxidant that has been linked to increased fat burning and improved metabolic rates. Studies have shown that regular consumption of green tea, which is high in Camellia Sinensis, can lead to significant weight loss and fat reduction. The thermogenic properties of Camellia Sinensis help elevate body temperature, which can increase calorie expenditure. Furthermore, it supports cardiovascular health and cognitive function, making it a vital component of Tea Burn's formulation.

Chromium

Chromium is an essential trace mineral that plays a critical role in carbohydrate and fat metabolism. It enhances the action of insulin, which is important for maintaining healthy blood sugar levels. By improving insulin sensitivity, Chromium helps to regulate appetite and reduce cravings, making it easier for individuals to adhere to their dietary goals. Several studies suggest that Chromium supplementation can lead to modest weight loss, particularly in individuals with insulin resistance. In Tea Burn, Chromium's inclusion not only supports weight management but also promotes overall metabolic health, making it a valuable ingredient for users.

L-Carnitine

L-Carnitine is an amino acid derivative that is essential for the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they are burned for energy. This process is crucial for effective fat metabolism, as it helps the body utilize stored fat as a source of energy. L-Carnitine has been widely studied for its role in weight loss, particularly in individuals looking to enhance their physical performance. By increasing the body's ability to burn fat, L-Carnitine can contribute to improved energy levels and endurance during workouts. In Tea Burn, L-Carnitine aids in maximizing the fat-burning potential of the other ingredients, supporting users in their weight loss efforts.

L-Theanine

L-Theanine is an amino acid primarily found in green tea, known for its calming effects and ability to promote relaxation without causing drowsiness. This ingredient is particularly important for individuals who may experience anxiety or stress while trying to lose weight. By enhancing mood and reducing stress, L-Theanine can help users make healthier food choices and stick to their diet plans. Additionally, L-Theanine works synergistically with caffeine, which is often present in tea, to improve cognitive function and focus. In Tea Burn, L-Theanine contributes to a balanced approach to weight loss by promoting mental clarity and reducing stress-related cravings.

Vitamin Complex

The Vitamin Complex in Tea Burn includes essential vitamins that support overall health and well-being. Vitamins play a crucial role in various bodily functions, including metabolism, energy production, and immune function. By incorporating a blend of vitamins, Tea Burn not only aids in weight loss but also promotes overall health. For instance, B vitamins are vital for energy metabolism, helping the body convert food into usable energy. Vitamins also support immune health, ensuring that users feel their best while on their weight loss journey. The inclusion of a Vitamin Complex in Tea Burn enhances its effectiveness, making it a comprehensive solution for those looking to improve their health and achieve their weight loss goals.

Tea Burn Science

The science behind Tea Burn is grounded in the research surrounding its key ingredients and their effects on weight loss and metabolic health. Studies have demonstrated that the individual components of Tea Burn, such as Chlorogenic Acid and Camellia Sinensis, possess significant fat-burning properties. For instance, research indicates that Chlorogenic Acid can inhibit glucose absorption in the intestines, which not only helps regulate blood sugar levels but also reduces fat accumulation.

Similarly, Camellia Sinensis is rich in catechins, which are known to enhance thermogenesis-the process by which the body generates heat and burns calories. Numerous studies have shown that green tea extract, which contains high levels of catechins, can lead to increased fat oxidation during exercise and at rest. This means that individuals who consume Tea Burn can potentially experience enhanced fat burning both during physical activity and throughout their daily routines.

The metabolic benefits of L-Carnitine are also well-documented. Research has shown that L-Carnitine can increase the amount of fat burned during exercise, contributing to improved weight loss outcomes. Additionally, studies suggest that L-Carnitine supplementation can enhance exercise performance, making it easier for individuals to engage in physical activity, which is essential for successful weight management.

Furthermore, the combination of L-Theanine with caffeine, commonly found in tea, has been shown to improve cognitive function and focus while also reducing the jitters often associated with caffeine consumption. This synergy can lead to better adherence to diet and exercise programs, as individuals are more likely to remain motivated and engaged in their weight loss journey.

Overall, the scientific evidence supporting the ingredients in Tea Burn validates its effectiveness as a weight loss support option. By leveraging the metabolic-enhancing properties of its components, Tea Burn offers users a natural and effective way to achieve their weight loss goals.

Tea Burn Benefits

Enhanced Metabolism

One of the primary benefits of Tea Burn is its ability to enhance metabolism. The combination of Chlorogenic Acid and Camellia Sinensis works to increase metabolic rates, allowing the body to burn calories more efficiently. This increased metabolic activity means that users can enjoy their favorite tea while actively promoting fat burning throughout the day. A faster metabolism also translates to higher energy levels, which can encourage a more active lifestyle and further support weight loss efforts.

Weight Management Support

Tea Burn provides effective support for weight management through its carefully selected ingredients. Chromium and L-Carnitine work together to regulate blood sugar levels and enhance fat metabolism, respectively. This combination helps to curb cravings and promote a feeling of fullness, making it easier for users to stick to their dietary goals. Many individuals struggle with hunger pangs and unhealthy cravings, but Tea Burn's formulation addresses these challenges, allowing for a more sustainable approach to weight loss.

Increased Energy Levels

Users of Tea Burn often report increased energy levels, which can be attributed to the synergistic effects of its ingredients. L-Carnitine is known for its ability to boost energy by facilitating the use of fat as an energy source. Additionally, the presence of L-Theanine helps to promote mental clarity and focus, allowing individuals to feel energized without the jitters commonly associated with high-caffeine products. This boost in energy can enhance physical performance and encourage a more active lifestyle, further supporting weight loss goals.

Improved Mood and Reduced Stress

The calming effects of L-Theanine play a significant role in promoting overall well-being while on a weight loss journey.

Does Tea Burn Really Work?

The effectiveness of Tea Burn is rooted in its unique blend of scientifically supported ingredients designed to enhance metabolism and promote fat loss. However, it is essential to understand that supplements are most effective when combined with a healthy diet and regular exercise.

Tea Burn's formulation leverages the fat-burning properties of its key ingredients, such as Chlorogenic Acid and Camellia Sinensis, to support weight loss. As studies indicate, these compounds can significantly enhance metabolic rates and improve fat oxidation. When users incorporate Tea Burn into their routine, they may experience increased energy levels and reduced appetite, both of which are crucial for maintaining a caloric deficit necessary for weight loss.

To maximize the benefits of Tea Burn, it is advisable for users to adopt a holistic approach to weight management. This includes eating a balanced diet rich in whole foods, engaging in regular physical activity, and staying hydrated. By making these lifestyle changes in conjunction with using Tea Burn, individuals can amplify their results and achieve their weight loss goals more effectively.

Moreover, the psychological aspect of weight loss should not be overlooked. Many users report feeling more motivated and focused when using Tea Burn, which can lead to better adherence to dietary and exercise programs. This emotional boost can be a powerful ally in the weight loss journey, helping individuals stay committed to their goals.

In conclusion, while Tea Burn can significantly aid in weight management, its true effectiveness is best realized when used alongside a healthy lifestyle. By combining the product with nutritious eating habits and regular exercise, users can unlock the full potential of Tea Burn and achieve lasting weight loss results.

Hopefully this is a good place to look for advice.  I've asked in a few other places and got some good advice from guys, but am looking for broader advice from men and women.

I'm 46M and have a 47F cousin who I've been reconnecting with in the last few years.  We've been leaning on each other for social and emotional support more and more. About a year ago, we both found out that we have been in open and other forms of alternative relationships and are both a bit kinky, sharing stories of our exploits.

Instead of our previous going out for coffee, she's been lately inviting me to coffee at her apartment, but we sit opposite ends of the sofa.  I had mentioned holding hands for comfort and support but she said she doesn't like holding hands.

A few months ago, she made reference to someone who was going to smack her butt. I said something like, ""I'd like to do that.""  She told me, ""You should.""  So I did.  Now nearly every time we greet, I smack or grab it really quick.  A couple times ago, I gave it a long and solid squeeze and she said, ""Ohhhh, ok!"" or something like that.   We also had lunch with her sister from out of town and on the restaurant patio, they both encouraged me to smack their butts (longer story in an earlier post in my profile).

I was able to get her to join me in a hot tub about a week ago, and I decided to take off my trunks, which she encouraged.  But when I said she could strip too, she just said, ""Yeah, I could.""  But she didn't.

Couple days later, her sister said she heard about the hot tub and wants to go with me next time she's in town. Main cousin of the story keeps saying over text it was fun.  They're obviously talking about me.

We're planning to go to the hot tub again tomorrow.

I don't want to screw this up.  I have immense feelings for her as a person and as a relative, and she's a huge emotional support now.  But I can't make sense of the small intimate acts that she seems ok with or even likes, and I don't know how far to push it without risking screwing it up.

Is she just a little untraditional like me or is she dropping hints and is as worried about what I'll think as I am worried about what she thinks?",1,1751511657.0,datingadviceformen,4,1.0,False

Trying to date in this town has been full of too many 1st dates, awkward meet ups, or situationships that lead nowhere.

Long story: 

My partner and I wanted to adopt an adult dog as a companion for my 6 year old Pomeranian as we are both full time workers and he is a ball of energy so we surmised that getting an adult friend for him, might tire him out a little as we felt guilty not playing with him as often as he wanted to. 
We also start work very early so there aren't any day cares that were open that we could of taken him to. 
We ended up finding a dog that was advertised online (not a breeder), 2 years old, same breed (Pomeranian) so went and saw her and made the impulsive decision to adopt without asking all the appropriate questions. 
We found out she had been abused, suffered from separation anxiety and more than likely, had been kept as an outside dog (i.e. not toilet trained). 
But... my 6 year old Pomeranian gets along with her quite well, which was a positive. 
After getting in a dog trainer to help with some of her issues, we thought things would be smooth sailing.. Wrong. 
She has almost gone backwards. As I mentioned, my partner and I work full time and when we come home we don't have much time left in the day other than to have dinner and go to bed so we have been really struggling with the following: 

1. Toilet training
 During the day both dogs are kept in the laundry with a dog door that allows them outside to a small run, 3m roughly, to use as a toilet or fresh air. But for the past month or so, she has been urinating inside but poops outside. We use the proper cleaners to clean up but she still goes inside almost daily. 

She does pee outside but cant understand why out of the however many times she goes during the day, she still goes inside. 
We have also tried crate training during the times we are home and it works for a couple of days / a week and then she will even go in her crate, despite just having been outside or free roam to go outside. 

2. Behaviour 
 She was abused at some point by her previous owners so whenever we at all express any frustration or try to physically move her off a seat or off our laps, she yelps blue murder, loudly! And we definitely are not doing anything to cause that.. It makes us feel terrible and even more frustrated at the situation because we aren't hurting her or doing anything wrong. 

She is food obsessed. Which is okay to a degree but she will go for anything, my vape was left on the arm chair and she hopped up and chewed it. I had a full cup of takeaway coffee on the coffee table and she pulled it off onto the carpeted floor. 

My partner is 95% settled on the decision that we should rehome her but I just don't want to feel like we've not tried all options first. 

Any help with the above would be super appreciated.

I add this because I know AMAB people *technically* have slower brain/maturity development, though idk if that matters at our age.

Also, this partner and I have been together for 11 years.

I work full time. My job doesn't pay great, but it pays more than enough to cover me when everything is split between me and my two partners (yes we are poly and we all live together, but this has only happened in recent months).

A few years ago, after a lot of discussion with my partner (let's call her H) I left my job due to terrible manager bullying and a toxic environment, and went to study my dream course at university. As discussed, H (partially) financially supported me while I was on government benefits. I am a pretty frugal person, I'm not really big on spending money on myself, so most of my money went to rent/bills/groceries.

Before the end of my course, H started to think about medically transitioning, and decided she needed to take a break from work to do so. I was supportive of this, and I got a full time job while still studying full time so that I could support her.

It's been 18-ish months now, and I myself have just started medically transitioning and am dealing with some horrible people at work, etc, which sucks but I'm dealing with it how I can. With my new hormone expenses and H's hormones, plus antidepressants for both of us and expenses for our cats, I am struggling to make ends meet.

Recently things got a little bit better when we moved in with our other partner, so now things are split 3 ways. Unfortunately our rent is now more expensive, but if I pay only for myself it is cheaper than our old situation. The issue here is because I'm paying for both me and H, everything is even more expensive.

I guess the problem is we have discussed a lot that I don't have enough money to cover everything. H agreed to get a job by the start of April and start covering her share of everything. She still has not found one.

I pay for most of her groceries and bills because she is on government benefits and barely makes enough to cover her share of rent. The issue is I feel like I'm drowning in expenses and I don't know what to do about it.

I've been helping H by assisting her with looking for work, helping read over her resume and sharing job opportunities with her. She HAS been applying, but I feel that she isn't taking it seriously.

I guess the biggest problem is that when she gets paid she transfers me money for rent and whatever bills are OVERdue (i.e. they have come out of my pocket) and then spends her money on video games or other luxuries, leaving me to cover groceries and be out of pocket for everything else. *Technically* she owes me money, but I'm not chasing this up as I know she doesn't have it and I WANT to support her, I just don't have the finances to do so.

I've been trying to encourage her to save money by getting public transport instead of driving, not buying unnecessary food items (like buying coffee out instead of making it at home, or buying food rather than cooking) but she gets really upset with me and tells me I'm being rude and manipulative. I can't cut her off because that would make me heartless seeing as she cannot afford to pay her way right now, but I don't know what to do.

Honestly you can probably tell my thoughts are all over the place with this, and I just need some sort of advice because I don't know how to deal with this situation.

Jonah grips the steering wheel tighter as he pulls into the parking lot of Fairoaks Psychiatric Hospital. His pulse is still hammering from the tunnels, from the unseen hands that brushed against his skin, from the voice that whispered to him in the dark. The marks on his arms are still there, faint smudges shaped like fingerprints, refusing to rub away.



His mind barely registers the hospital’s cold, gray exterior—he’s still thinking about what Marco told him.



Beth Farron, Julia’s mother, was found outside the thrift store, raving about a scarred woman, clawing at her own skin.



Jonah takes a slow breath, steadying himself. He is investigating her daughter’s disappearance. He needs to speak to Beth. She might have answers.



Inside, the hospital smells of antiseptic and old tile. He approaches the front desk, flashing his old badge out of habit.



""I need to see Beth Farron,"" he says.



The nurse barely looks up. ""Psych hold. No visitors unless authorized.""



Jonah leans in. ""I’m working her daughter’s case. Julia Farron—missing person. I think Beth knows something.""



The name makes the nurse hesitate. Recognition flickers in her face. She nods and picks up the phone.



Minutes later, Dr. Monroe approaches—a lanky man with deep-set eyes.



""Jonah Thorson?"" Monroe asks, glancing at his notes. ""Beth mentioned your name before she was sedated.""



Jonah stiffens. ""She did?""



""Not directly,"" Monroe clarifies. ""She kept saying, ‘He knows. He’s seen it too.’ And then…"" His voice lowers. ""She started whispering a name. Onoskelis.""



Jonah’s blood turns to ice.



Monroe motions for him to follow. ""She’s calm now, but I won’t lie—she’s not well.""



They walk down a sterile hallway lined with locked doors. Inside, figures mutter, rock back and forth, stare at the ceiling with vacant eyes.



Monroe stops at Room 23.



""She hasn’t spoken since we sedated her,"" he says, pushing open the door.



Beth Farron sits by the window, staring blankly outside. The dim light washes over her frail, trembling hands—hands covered in scratches and bruises. But Jonah’s stomach lurches when he sees what’s carved into her arm.



A symbol. Deep. Fresh. Deliberate.



The same symbol Julia traced on her locker.



The same one Jonah unknowingly drew on his desk.



Jonah swallows hard. ""Has she been restrained?""



Monroe nods. ""We caught her trying to dig into her own skin with her fingernails. It’s like she was trying to carve something out of herself.""



Jonah steps forward cautiously. ""Beth?""



Her head turns slowly, eyes hollow and sunken, lips barely parted.



For a long moment, she just stares at him.



Then, she whispers, ""It’s too late.""



Jonah’s spine stiffens. ""Too late for what?""



Beth’s breathing is shallow. Her fingers twitch against the hospital gown. ""She’s in me.""



Jonah meets Monroe’s uneasy gaze. He kneels beside her chair, lowering his voice.



""Beth—who is in you?""



Beth trembles violently. ""She whispers when I sleep. She touches my hands, my face. I see her in the mirror."" Her voice drops to a whisper. ""I thought I could stop it. I thought if I gave her something, she’d leave me alone.""



Jonah’s stomach clenches. ""Gave her what?""



Beth slowly turns her arms upward, exposing more scratches.



Some are words.



""For Julia.""



""For Jonah.""



""For Her.""



Jonah feels his throat tighten.



Beth’s eyes begin to dart around the room like something invisible is circling her. Monroe shifts uncomfortably.



Then Beth suddenly jerks forward, grabbing Jonah’s wrist with startling strength.



Her fingernails dig into his skin.



Jonah flinches. ""Beth—!""



She leans in close, her voice barely a breath.



""She’s watching us right now.""



Jonah’s skin crawls.



Beth’s gaze flicks past him, to the darkened mirror on the far wall.



Jonah slowly follows her gaze—



—and sees something standing behind him.



A woman. Scarred. Smiling.



His heart slams into his ribs.



Beth’s body jerks violently, like something just yanked her back.



Monroe reaches for the emergency call button—



Beth screams.



A raw, unearthly scream that makes the lights flicker.



Jonah tries to grab her arms, but she thrashes wildly—



Her head slams into the wall.



Once.



Twice.



Three times.



A sickening crack echoes through the room.



Then—silence.



Beth collapses forward, her body trembling.



Jonah scrambles to catch her—""Beth, hold on!""—but as she lifts her face, her lips are curling into a faint, eerie smile.



Then, with a final, shuddering breath—



Beth goes still.



The flatline rings in Jonah’s ears.



A cold presence lingers in the air.



Jonah staggers backward, his pulse hammering, his breath sharp and uneven.



His gaze flickers to the mirror.



The scarred woman is gone.



But Jonah feels her.



She is still here.



A chime breaks the silence.



Jonah’s phone.



He fumbles for it, his hands shaking, his mind still trapped in this room, in this horror—



But the text isn’t from Marco.



It’s from Julia.



Two words.



""Help me.""

Jonah flinches. ""Beth—!""



She leans in close, her voice barely a breath.



""She’s watching us right now.""



Jonah’s skin crawls.



Beth’s gaze flicks past him, to the darkened mirror on the far wall.



Jonah slowly follows her gaze—



—and sees something standing behind him.



A woman. Scarred. Smiling.



His heart slams into his ribs.



Beth’s body jerks violently, like something just yanked her back.



Monroe reaches for the emergency call button—



Beth screams.



A raw, unearthly scream that makes the lights flicker.



Jonah tries to grab her arms, but she thrashes wildly—



Her head slams into the wall.



Once.



Twice.



Three times.



A sickening crack echoes through the room.



Then—silence.



Beth collapses forward, her body trembling.



Jonah scrambles to catch her—""Beth, hold on!""—but as she lifts her face, her lips are curling into a faint, eerie smile.



Then, with a final, shuddering breath—



Beth goes still.



The flatline rings in Jonah’s ears.



A cold presence lingers in the air.



Jonah staggers backward, his pulse hammering, his breath sharp and uneven.



His gaze flickers to the mirror.



The scarred woman is gone.



But Jonah feels her.



She is still here.



A chime breaks the silence.



Jonah’s phone.



He fumbles for it, his hands shaking, his mind still trapped in this room, in this horror—



But the text isn’t from Marco.



It’s from an unknown number.



""You can't help her.""



Chapter 21 – The Mark Follows

Jonah sits in his car, gripping the steering wheel so tightly his knuckles turn white. The hospital looms behind him, but his mind is still trapped inside Room 23, replaying the moment Beth’s skull cracked against the wall. The sound—that sickening crunch—won’t leave him.



Neither will the text message.



""You can’t help her.""



The words glow on his phone’s screen, taunting him.



Jonah stares at it, his breath shallow.



Who sent this? Julia? Onoskelis? Someone else?



A part of him wants to dismiss it—some sick joke, maybe someone who heard about Beth's breakdown. But no. He knows better.



Because even now, he feels it.



Something followed him out of that hospital.



His reflection moves.

Jonah catches it in the rearview mirror.



Not him. Not exactly.



His reflection is a second behind, slower, like it's studying him.



Then—its head tilts, just slightly.



Jonah spins in his seat. The back of the car is empty.



He exhales sharply, runs a shaking hand through his hair.



Get a grip, Thorson.



He unlocks his phone, forces himself to scroll past the text. He needs help. He needs someone who understands this kind of thing.



Margot. Caldwell.



Jonah dials Margot first.



She picks up on the third ring. ""Jonah?""



His voice is tight. ""I need to see you. And Caldwell. Now.""



A pause. Then, a note of concern. ""What happened?""



Jonah swallows. ""Beth Farron. She’s dead.""



Silence.



When Margot speaks again, her voice is hushed, almost cautious.



""Where are you?""



Jonah glances at the hospital. The lights in the windows seem too dim now, like the building is sinking into shadow.



""Leaving Fairoaks.""



Margot doesn’t hesitate. ""Come to my place. Bring whatever you found in the tunnels.""



Jonah hangs up, pulls out of the parking lot. He should call Marco, update him, but not yet.



Not until he understands what the hell just happened.



Margot’s Apartment – The Weight of the Effigy

Jonah knocks twice before Margot opens the door.



She doesn’t greet him right away. Instead, she stands in the threshold, wafting a brazier filled with burning sage and sweetgrass, her expression tight with concern. The fragrant smoke curls around him, clinging to his clothes, seeping into his skin. The scent is sharp but warm, grounding. A ward against spirits.



Jonah lifts a brow. ""This necessary?""



Margot nods grimly. ""I don’t take chances anymore.""



Jonah steps inside, letting the smoke roll over him. He should find it ridiculous, but after what happened at the hospital—\*\*after what happened in the tunnels—\*\*he welcomes it.



The apartment smells of herbs, incense, and something metallic underneath. The dim lighting makes the clutter of books, relics, and symbols scrawled on parchment look almost ritualistic in its arrangement.



Margot sets the brazier down on the wooden table between them. ""Take off your jacket.""



Jonah hesitates. ""Why?""



Margot gives him a look. ""Because I need to see if anything followed you.""



Jonah exhales through his nose but obliges, shrugging out of his coat and tossing it over the back of a chair. Margot moves closer, fingers hovering just over his forearm without touching, like she’s feeling for something unseen.



Then, her expression darkens.



""Jonah…"" she murmurs, tilting his arm slightly to examine the smudged fingerprints still clinging to his skin. She traces a symbol in the air above them, lips moving silently. The marks don’t fade.



Jonah watches her face. ""That bad?""



Margot meets his eyes. ""You didn’t just see something in the tunnels, did you?""



Jonah swallows. ""No.""



She gestures to the bag slung over his shoulder. ""You brought it?""



Jonah doesn’t have to ask what she means. He unzips the bag and pulls out the effigy. It’s still wrapped in cloth, but even without touching it directly, Jonah feels it.



A weight. A pulse.



Margot hesitates before unwrapping it.



Dr. Caldwell, who has been silent until now, leans forward with a skeptical sigh.



""Alright, let’s not get carried away,"" Caldwell says, adjusting his glasses. ""You’re both talking about this thing like it has an inherent power. Artifacts like this—while culturally significant—don’t hold any real influence beyond what people assign to them.""



Margot shoots him an irritated glance. ""Then why don’t you touch it, professor?""



Caldwell folds his arms. ""Because it's old, likely unsanitary, and possibly covered in lead paint, if the charring is any indication. I’d rather not take home tetanus or a fungal infection.""



Jonah smirks despite himself. ""Glad to know you're keeping an open mind, Doc.""



Caldwell waves a dismissive hand. ""Look, I’m here because I respect you both, and I want to help interpret whatever historical context might be at play. But let’s be rational—symbols don’t move, whispers don’t come from wood, and spirits don’t leave voicemail messages.""



Margot glares. ""Tell that to Beth Farron.""



The mention of Beth makes the room fall silent.



Caldwell sighs, rubbing his temple. ""Beth was suffering from a psychological break, Jonah. It’s tragic, but let’s not assign supernatural meaning to something that already has a logical explanation. Trauma. Guilt. Psychosis. These things manifest in ways we don’t fully understand, but they don’t require demons to exist.""



Jonah exhales slowly. He doesn’t know what he believes anymore. But he knows what he saw.



Margot unwraps the effigy, and the second it’s exposed—



The air seems to shift.



Jonah swears he feels pressure. Like a shift in atmospheric weight.



Caldwell leans in, squinting at the carvings. ""These markings… they aren’t just protection sigils. They’re a form of binding.""



Margot crosses her arms. ""Binding what, exactly?""



Caldwell hesitates for a fraction of a second before saying, ""A belief. A concept. This was likely used in a ritual meant to either invoke or contain something within a specific cultural framework. It’s common in older civilizations—Egyptians, Mesopotamians, even some early European pagan groups. But it’s not magic, it’s symbolism. A way of externalizing control over something people feared.""



Jonah watches him closely. ""So you’re saying this was meant to… trap something?""



Caldwell shakes his head. ""Not literally. More like a psychological safeguard. A way of saying, ‘We control this, not the other way around.’ It gives people power over their fears.""



Margot scoffs. ""Then why does it feel like it’s still holding onto something?""



Caldwell doesn’t answer immediately.



Instead, he reaches out—barely grazing the surface with his fingertips.



The second his skin touches it—



Every candle in the apartment flickers.



The room feels smaller.



Jonah’s breath turns visible. Cold.



Margot snatches Caldwell’s hand away from the effigy. ""Don’t touch it!""



Caldwell pulls back, exhaling sharply. ""That was a coincidence,"" he mutters, though his voice lacks conviction. ""Airflow change. Draft in the room.""



Margot’s stare is unforgiving. ""Say it again. Say it like you believe it.""



Caldwell removes his glasses, rubbing his eyes. ""I’m just saying—there’s always an explanation. Always.""



Jonah leans against the table. ""Then explain what’s happening to me.""



Caldwell hesitates, watching the effigy. ""You believe something is happening. Your mind is reinforcing it. Fear, repetition, pattern recognition—it’s how belief systems take hold. But beliefs, Jonah… they don’t make things real.""



Jonah clenches his jaw. ""Then why do I feel like something is watching me even now?""



Caldwell has no answer.



Margot crosses the room, grabbing another bundle of herbs and lighting it. She waves the smoke around Jonah, her movements slow, methodical.



""You don’t have to believe in something for it to mark you,"" she says softly. ""You just have to let it in.""



Later That Night – The Vision

Jonah stares at the effigy on his desk, the apartment silent around him.



Margot told him not to touch it again.



Caldwell told him to burn it.



Jonah does neither.



He just watches it.



His body feels wrong. Heavy. His limbs don’t belong to him.



The hum starts again.



Soft. Deep. Crawling through his skull.



Jonah blinks—



And he’s somewhere else.



The Altar. The Darkness. The Voice.

The walls pulse. Symbols shift and rearrange themselves.



The altar stands before him.



Jonah can’t move.



He hears whispers.



He turns—



And she is there.



Onoskelis.



Scarred. Smiling.



She moves toward him slowly, the air around her rippling like heat waves.



Jonah’s chest tightens. He tries to step back—but his feet won’t obey.



Her hand reaches out.



Brushes against his chest.



Jonah gasps. It feels like fingers pressing through his ribs.



Her lips curl into something mocking, hungry.



""You are mine.""



The room shatters around him.



Jonah jerks awake. The effigy is in his hands.



Unwrapped.



His phone buzzes.



Unknown Number:



""Brother, I found you.""



Chapter 22 – The Bloodline



Jonah drops the effigy.



It thuds against the wooden floor, but the sound is \*\*wrong—\*\*muffled, as if the weight of it sinks deeper than it should.



His eyes flick to his phone. The words are still there.



""Brother, I found you.""



Jonah’s pulse hammers against his ribs.



No.



This can’t be her.



His sister is dead.



The past claws its way forward. The night she disappeared. The way the adults talked about it in hushed tones. The way no one ever found her.



Jonah swallows hard, his fingers hovering over the screen. He types:



""Who is this?""



Seconds stretch into eternity. The phone remains silent.



Then—



The screen flickers.



The reply comes through.



""Come find me.""



A location link follows.



Jonah clicks it before he can stop himself. His stomach drops.



Old Sacramento.



Deep in the tunnels.



Where he barely escaped with his sanity intact.



Jonah tightens his grip on the phone. His body feels off, like his limbs don’t belong to him anymore. He rubs his arms absentmindedly—



The smudges are still there. Warm. Itchy. He rubs at them, desperate, like an addict clawing at an old wound.



Margot was right.



The mark followed him.



Jonah sucks in a sharp breath, turning away from the phone like it might lash out at him.



This is a trap.  The walls of his apartment feel like they are closing in on him, the shadows moving about with a life of their own.



It has to be.



His phone buzzes again.



Jonah doesn’t check it. Instead, he grabs his keys and heads for the only person who might have answers.



Margot’s Apartment – The Truth Comes Out



Margot barely has time to react before Jonah is inside, shutting the door behind him with too much force.



She doesn’t yell at him for barging in.



She takes one look at him and asks ""What's wrong Jonah?""  He shoves his phone at her. 



""Read it.""



Margot takes the phone, scanning the message.



A confused look appears across her face.  She clearly doesn't understand the context of the message

Jonah drags a hand down his face. ""Explain this. Explain how I got this message from my sister?  She's been missing for 25 years!  The same damn night I saw Beth die. Explain why it feels like I’m not alone even when I’m standing in an empty goddamn room.""



Margot sat down, speaking  carefully. ""Jonah… you've never mentioned a sister before.""



Jonah’s jaw tightens, he doesn't want say it, he doesn't want to relive the memory of loosing his older sister.  As if he once he talks about it, it becomes real and he won't ever be able to find her.



He exhales sharply, running a shaking hand through his hair.



""When I was eight, my sister disappeared."" His voice is low, measured, detached.



Margot stills. ""Disappeared?""



Jonah nods.



""It was… strange. There was no forced entry. No struggle. It was like she just… vanished. No body. No evidence. No answers.""



Margot grips the edge of the table. ""Jesus, Jonah.""



Jonah swallows hard. ""I don’t talk about it. Not even to Marco. Because what’s the point? She’s gone. And I made peace with that a long time ago.""  A brief memory of the missing posters. The whispers of the neighbors. His mother leaving the porch light on every night for a year flashed before his eyes.



Margot’s voice softens. ""Until now.""



Jonah nods once. His voice drops. ""Until now.""



Margot’s gaze drifts back to the phone. ""You think this is her?""



Jonah sat there silent, his head in his hands.  Unsure of what was happening to him at the moment.  He didn't know what to think any more.  A part of him, wanted to believe that his sister was still out there trying to find her way home, but he knew the odds. 



Margot steps forward, her voice gentle but firm.



""Jonah, listen to me. Whatever this is, it is not your sister. It’s using her. It wants you back down there.""



Jonah clenched his fists. The outline of tears running down his face, highlighted by the dim lighting in her apartment.  ""Then what the hell am I supposed to do? Pretend it’s not happening?"" 



""Yes!"" Margot snaps. ""Because if you go, you won’t come back!""



The words slam into him.



Jonah exhales sharply, turning away.



Margot softens, stepping closer. ""Jonah… I know what it’s like to want to believe. I do. But you have to trust me—this thing is feeding off you. It’s in your head now. It’ll keep pulling you back until there’s nothing left of you.""



Jonah stared at the window.



His reflection doesn’t move.



Margot sees his face. She grabs her phone.



""I’m calling Caldwell.""



Jonah scoffs. ""What’s he gonna do? Call me delusional?""



Margot doesn’t blink. ""Yes. And we need that right now.""



Jonah exhales through his nose. He nods once.



Margot dials.



Jonah stares at his reflection.



It still hasn’t moved.



Dr. Caldwell’s Office – A Scholar’s Doubt



Caldwell leans back in his chair, adjusting his glasses with a sigh.



""So let me get this straight."" His tone is calm, clinical.



""You believe the entity—\*\*the one associated with Julia’s disappearance, the one linked to Beth’s death, the one Margot insists exists despite all logic—\*\*is now communicating with you. Personally.""



Jonah glares. ""It’s not a belief. It’s a fact.""



Caldwell nods slowly. ""I see. And your evidence?""



Jonah throws his phone on the desk.



Caldwell glances at the message.



""Brother, I found you.""



Caldwell exhales through his nose. ""How do you know this isn’t a hoax?""



Jonah’s jaw tightened as he tried to restrain himself. ""Because, I haven't spoken about this to anyone in years!  I saw something at the hospital, Doc. I saw something in my mirror. And I saw it in yours, too."" 



Dr. Caldwell removed his glasses and began cleaning them while he talked. But Jonah noticed the slight change in his tone, and the tension in his shoulders, almost as if doubt had crept in to his analytical mind. 



Margot cuts in. ""Caldwell. Stop pretending. You touched that effigy, and something happened. You felt it.""



Caldwell looks away. ""Psychosomatic response. Environmental suggestion. Fear creates the illusion of manifestation.""



Margot scoffs. ""Tell that to Beth Farron.""



Caldwell exhales sharply.



Jonah leans forward. His voice is like stone.



""If this isn’t real, Doc—why do I feel it watching me even now?""



Caldwell doesn’t answer.



Margot grips Jonah’s arm. ""Let’s go.""



Jonah’s Apartment – The Nightmare



Jonah barely made it inside his apartment, hyperventilating he tried to slow his breathing down.  But the air felt wrong.  It was heavy.  He noticed the shadows in corners, they weren't just dark.  They had a depth to them, like a person waiting for him.  Panic over taking him, he rushed to the bathroom sink and splashing water on his face.   



He looked in the mirror expecting to see himself looking back.  But that wasn't what he saw, his reflection was facing the wrong direction, it was looking away from him.  He gripped the sink, his knuckles white from the strain.  The head twisted unnaturally around slowly, and the sound like bones grinding together.  When he could see the face looking back at him it wasn't his own but hers, Onoskelis. 



Jonah stumbled out of the bathroom falling to his knees before the vision takes him.



He falls to his knees.



The hum is deafening now.



The walls pulse. The air tightens. The apartment is gone. The altar is in front of him. The symbols move, shifting like they’re alive. Jonah looks down and he see's himself standing in front of the altar.  His hands stained a dark red with blood, screaming.  And she is there.  



Onoskelis.



Scarred. Smiling. Waiting.



Jonah tries to move, but his body won’t obey.



Her fingers drift toward his chest.  The pressure digs in.



Jonah gasps, choking—



His ribs crack.



Jonah felt her hands wrapping around his chest, he felt the warmth in her breath as she spoke.

""Brother. You found me, and I will never let you go.....""  The words wrapped around him like a snake suffocating it's prey.

For a brief second, Jonah was so happy. Maybe the happiest he had ever been.

His sister was here. He could feel her warmth. He could smell her—sun-kissed and wild, like grass after the rain.

Tears burned in his eyes. His voice cracked when he whispered:

""I found you.""

The arms around him tightened.

At first, it felt comforting. Protective.

Then the grip grew stronger. Too strong.

The warmth became heat. The embrace, a trap.

Jonah’s breath hitched.

""I will never let you go,"" she whispered, and this time, it wasn’t his sister’s voice.



Then his world shatters.



Jonah jerks awake.



The effigy is in his hands.



Unwrapped.



His phone buzzes.



Unknown Number:



""We were so close, couldn't you feel it.""



Chapter 23

Jonah woke on the floor of his apartment, the bathroom light still on. His body felt wrong—too heavy, like something was pressing down on him. His limbs ached, stiff from the cold, hard floor. When he inhaled, his ribs protested, the phantom pressure from last night’s vision still lingering.



He forced himself upright, swaying for a moment before steadying against the doorframe.



The nightmares clung to him, the sensation of her hands still lingering on his chest, phantom fingers pressing through flesh and bone. But the morning light—thin and gray—seeped through the blinds, chasing away the shadows that had swallowed him whole the night before.



He exhaled shakily. Still here.



He stumbled into the kitchen, every movement sluggish, like wading through water. Routine. That’s what he needed. Something normal. Something tangible.



Jonah filled the kettle and placed it on the stove, the click of the burner sparking to life grounding him. Opening the jar of coffee grounds, he added an extra scoop, as if the bitterness might carve away the fog in his brain.



He leaned against the painted cast iron sink, hands gripping the edge until his knuckles turned white. He stared at the faucet, watching a slow drip of water slide down the porcelain, the silence between drops stretching long and heavy.



He tried to rationalize the past twenty-four hours. Tried.



The tunnels.

Beth.

The text message.

The reflection that wasn’t his own.

The vision.

His stomach churned.



The whistle of the kettle jolted him back. He turned, shaking off the weight pressing against his ribs. He poured the hot water over the coffee grounds, steam curling upward, the scent rich and familiar.



Jonah closed his eyes, inhaling deeply.



For a moment—just a moment—he let himself believe that this was enough. That the warmth of the kitchen, the smell of coffee, the morning sun creeping through the blinds meant he was just Jonah Thorson again.



Not marked.

Not hunted.

Not standing on the edge of something he couldn’t comprehend.



But the moment passed.



The quiet felt unnatural now, like something waiting to be filled.



Jonah grabbed his phone from the counter, hesitating before unlocking the screen. He already knew what he would see. The message from the unknown number.



""We were so close, couldn't you feel it?""



His throat tightened.



He pushed past the nausea, scrolled to Marco’s contact, and pressed call.



The dial tone hummed in his ear, breaking the silence of the morning.



Jonah rubbed his face, exhaustion weighing him down. The world around him still felt wrong. Stretched. Unfamiliar.



His gaze drifted to his hands as he waited for Marco to pick up.

""Bueno,"" Marco said as he answered the phone. In the background, Jonah could hear laughter, clattering plates, the muffled hum of a morning radio. Life.



For a second, he had forgotten what that sounded like.



""Marco,"" Jonah said, his voice rougher than expected. He hesitated, then exhaled through his nose. ""What are you doing later this morning? I need to talk to you.""



The warmth in Marco’s voice faded, replaced by something more serious.



""Hermano, what's wrong?"" He paused, then added, ""Don't lie to me either. I'll know—you know my abuela had the sight."" Marco said jokingly. 



Jonah’s stomach tightened. He wanted to lie, to downplay it, but what was the point?



He gave Marco a brief, clipped rundown of the last 24 hours—the tunnels, Beth, the message, the vision. He left out how it felt. The weight in his bones. The way the shadows felt different now.



Marco didn’t interrupt. He just listened. When Jonah finally stopped talking, Marco let out a long breath.



""Meet me at the diner on 8th in an hour,"" Marco said, voice steady. ""We'll talk there.""



Jonah nodded, even though Marco couldn't see him. ""Yeah. Thanks, man.""



""Siempre, hermano.""



Jonah hung up and leaned back against the counter, rubbing his eyes. Marco would help. He always did.



But as Jonah exhaled, his hand drifted down to his forearm. His fingers brushed the marks.



Still there.



His stomach tightened.



Jonah turned toward the sink, gripping the edge as he stared at his hands under the dim kitchen light. The smudges hadn’t faded. If anything, they looked darker now, sinking deeper into his skin.



He rubbed at them, harder this time. A slow, sticky warmth spread beneath his fingertips—like oil seeping into a wound.



A faint nausea curled in his stomach.



Jonah’s gaze flickered to the window above the sink. His reflection looked back at him—tired, pale, distant.



Then—



Something moved behind him.



Not much. Just enough.



A shadow, barely shifting. Like something stretching. Waking up.



A breath of cold air curled against the back of his neck.



Jonah stiffened, his pulse spiking—



Don’t turn around, he told himself, shifting his arm to shield his ribcage.



The thought came unbidden. Instinctual. Like an old fear waking up inside him.



He turned anyway.



Nothing.



Just his empty apartment.



The air felt still, but something had changed.



Jonah’s fingers drifted back to the smudges. They weren’t just stains.



They were sinking into him.



Deeper. Itching. Burning.



Not just on his skin. Beneath it.



Spreading.



Growing.



Jonah inhaled sharply, glancing at the window’s reflection—



—and froze.



His reflection stood exactly as it should. Except for one thing.



Its arm wasn’t shielding its ribs.



It stood there, completely exposed.



Watching him.



The nausea twisted sharper. Jonah swallowed hard, ripping his gaze away.



The smudges crawled across his skin, slow and patient.



Growing, like coral slowly crawling and expanding across the ocean floor. Consuming what was once Jonah Thorson.



And he wasn’t sure they would ever stop.



Chapter 24

Jonah left his apartment early, needing to put distance between himself and the walls that had begun to feel more like a prison.



The drive down the damp streets of downtown provided him with a minor semblance of clarity—a grounding he desperately needed.



The city still moved as it always did. Cars honked, pedestrians shuffled along wet sidewalks, neon signs flickered against puddles in the gutters. Life moved forward.



But inside Jonah, something had stalled.



He gripped the steering wheel tighter, flexing his fingers against the leather, feeling the marks beneath his sleeves. Still there. He hadn’t checked, not since the kitchen. Didn’t need to. He could feel them.



Burning. Itching. Sinking.



His reflection in the rearview mirror felt off.



Not delayed, not distorted. But wrong in a way he couldn’t quite name.



Jonah forced himself to look away. Just drive.



The Diner on 8th

Marco was already at their usual booth, stirring his coffee, watching the door like he’d been expecting Jonah before he even walked in.



Jonah slid into the seat across from him, shoulders tense.



“You’re early,” he muttered.



Marco smirked, shaking his head. “And you look like shit.”



Jonah huffed a humorless laugh, rubbing a hand down his face. “Feel like it too.”



The waitress appeared with a fresh cup of coffee and set it in front of him without a word. He wrapped his hands around it, letting the heat seep into his fingers.



Marco watched him. Not pushing, just waiting.



Jonah exhaled sharply.



“You’re gonna think I’ve lost it.”



Marco leaned back in the booth, tilting his head. “Already do. Now tell me why.”



Jonah wanted to joke, to shake it off, but he couldn’t. Not this time.



So he told him.



Everything.



The tunnels. The symbols. The hum in his skull.



The visions. The effigy. The messages.



Beth’s death.



And the marks.



The Proof

Jonah unrolled his sleeves, pushing them up past his forearms.



The smudges hadn’t faded. If anything, they had deepened, like ink soaking into his skin.



Marco stared.



Didn’t speak. Didn’t move.



Jonah studied him, waiting for doubt. Waiting for skepticism.



But instead—



Marco reached out.



His fingers hovered above the marks, close enough to feel the heat radiating off them.



Then—he pulled back fast, shaking out his hand like something had crawled up his skin. Marco made the sign of the cross and muttered under his breath, ""Dios mío.""



Jonah’s stomach twisted. “You see them.”



Marco didn’t answer right away. His fingers flexed, like trying to shake off something unseen.



“Not just see them,” Marco muttered. He looked up at Jonah, something unreadable in his expression.



“I felt them.”



The Realization

Jonah felt the cold sink deeper.



Marco saw them. Marco felt them.



This wasn’t in his head.



It wasn’t just him.



His stomach clenched. “Tell me I’m not losing my mind.”



Marco wasn’t laughing anymore.



He took a slow sip of coffee, eyes distant, thoughtful. Then he sighed.



“I don’t know what this is, hermano,” he admitted. “But I know what it feels like.”



Jonah swallowed. “And?”



Marco met his gaze. “A warning.”



Marco set his cup down and leaned in slightly, lowering his voice. “My abuela used to tell me stories when I was a niño. I always laughed them off. But she would give me this look—one that said don’t fuck around right now.”



Jonah raised an eyebrow, but Marco continued.



“She told me stories of la bruja—the witch that lived in the woods near her village in Mexico. People would leave tributes to her. Those who didn’t? Well…” Marco glanced at Jonah’s arms. “They were cursed. Bad things started happening. Accidents. Nightmares. Illness. And the ones who ignored it?”



His jaw tightened.



“They vanished.”



Jonah clenched his jaw, pausing before he spoke. ""A witch? Really?""



Marco exhaled sharply. “Mierda, look at you!” He motioned toward Jonah’s arms. “Tienes la maldición de las brujas!”



He made the sign of the cross again, fingers moving from his forehead to his chest, then across his shoulders.



Jonah rubbed his face before taking a drink from his coffee. “So how do I break this curse?”



Marco ran a hand over his chin, thinking. “My abuela said you get a priest to pray with you. But that could take time… depending on how la bruja cursed you and what she used. There’s another way, though.”



Jonah leaned in slightly. “Go on.”



Marco hesitated.



“You could find another witch—a bruja blanca. A good one.”



Jonah exhaled. “But?”



Marco frowned. “But these things… they’re dangerous, Jonah. There’s always a cost.”



Jonah’s stomach twisted. Of course there was.



Marco sighed, shaking his head.



“What the hell are you wrapped up in, Jonah?”



Jonah exhaled sharply, dragging a hand through his hair. “I don’t know. But it won’t let me go.”



Silence stretched between them.



Then Marco spoke again, voice quieter.



“You’re not gonna like what I say next.”



Jonah huffed a bitter laugh. “Can’t wait.”



Marco leaned forward, elbows on the table.



“We have to go back to the tunnels.”



Jonah stiffened.



Every instinct screamed no.



But deep down—



He already knew.

The morning air was crisp, carrying the faint hum of city life as Jonah Thorsen followed Beth back to her and Julia's apartment. He parked on the street in front of Beth Farron’s modest apartment building. It was a squat, aging structure with peeling paint and a cracked walkway, the kind of place that whispered stories of struggling tenants and lives lived paycheck to paycheck. Jonah stepped out of his car, scanning the area. A flicker of movement caught his eye—a shadow retreating into the alley beside the building. He paused, his hand brushing the edge of his jacket, where his Kimber TLE .45 ACP normally rested.  But he left it in his office, suddenly missing it's reassuring weight.  Thankfully nothing followed, and he shook it off as the heightened awareness that came with cases like this.



Beth was waiting by the door, her arms wrapped tightly around herself against the lingering chill. “Well, this is it,” she said, her voice strained. Dark circles hung beneath her eyes, deeper than they had been at the diner.



Jonah nodded toward the door. “Shall we?” His tone was steady, professional.



She led him upstairs, her keys jangling faintly in her trembling hand as she unlocked the door to their apartment. Jonah scanned his surroundings, taking in every detail of the small courtyard. The place was neat but lived-in, with a small kitchen visible through the open doorway and a cluttered coffee table in the living room. Framed photos lined the walls—Beth and Julia at various ages, smiling in sunnier times. The apartment carried the faint scent of lavender, likely from the diffuser on the counter, but beneath it was something Jonah couldn’t place. A faint metallic tang clung to the air, gnawing at the back of his throat. He smacked his tongue against the roof of his mouth, trying to rid himself of the taste.



“Julia’s room is down the hall,” Beth said, motioning nervously. “I—I haven’t touched anything since she disappeared.”



Jonah nodded. “That’s good. I’ll take a look.”



He moved down the narrow hallway, his boots creaking softly against the hardwood. Julia’s door was ajar, revealing a room that immediately struck Jonah as typical for someone her age. A bed with a neatly folded comforter, a desk scattered with textbooks and notes, and a corkboard pinned with photos of friends, ticket stubs, and colorful sticky notes. Everything seemed... normal.



Jonah scanned the room with the practiced eye of a detective. He opened the desk drawers, flipping through papers and finding little more than class schedules and essays. He moved to the nightstand, pulling it open. Inside was a phone charger, a small makeup bag, and an old paperback novel. He turned to the closet, sliding the door open to reveal rows of neatly hung clothes and shoes lined up with precision.



It was almost too normal.



He ran his hands through rows of folded sweatshirts stuffed into small cubbies, and there he felt something hard. The spine of a notebook. His fingers grasped its edges and pulled it free from its surroundings. It was a leather-bound journal, the corners worn from frequent use. The initials “J.F.” were scrawled on the cover in silver ink. The inside cover was adorned with delicate drawings and inspirational quotes Julia had penned.



Jonah flipped it open, skimming the pages. The first few entries were mundane: notes about school assignments, shifts at work, and casual mentions of friends. But as he flipped further, the tone shifted.



“Met someone interesting today,” one entry read. “They were waiting for the store to open, they’re... different. Can’t explain it, but I feel like they understand me in a way no one else does.”



“I’m normally not interested in those dark, broody types, but... I don’t know. I can’t put my finger on it. Something in me wants to know this person more, needs to know.”



Jonah frowned, continuing to skim. The entries grew more erratic, the handwriting messier.



“Today they told me I’m special in a way that no one else sees but them. This made me uneasy but excited at the same time. No one would ever say something like that to me. It’s like when they spoke, they were speaking as if they were from a different time or something.”



“They said there’s a place I should see. A gathering. Said I’d feel more alive than ever. I don’t know, I probably shouldn’t go—my mom would kill me if she found out. I already feel guilty for not telling her about my new friend... but part of me wants to go.”



Jonah furled his brow as he read this.  He knew from his time on Sac PD, that these pop ups were often dangerous.  Drugs flowed freely and were pushed to ""enhance"" the experience.  He remembered waiting for an ambulance at more than one of these events, and having to tell the parents that their child had died from a drug overdose.



As Jonah thumbed through the journal, he felt something strange. His fingers tingled faintly, as though the pages had left a residue—a visceral film that clung to his skin. He rubbed his his hands against pants as if trying to get oil off of them, but the sensation didn’t fade. It wasn’t sticky, not physical, but it lingered, a grime that felt more imagined than real. Jonah scowled, shutting the journal with more force than he intended.



Beth appeared in the doorway, her expression hesitant. “Find anything?”



Jonah hesitated before handing her the journal. “Take a look.”



Jonah looked around Julia's room again while Beth read through her daughters Journal.  Her hands trembleing as she turned each page.  Jonah noted a small strange symbol etched into the window of Julia's room.  He walked over and ran his fingers over it, tracing the lines in the cold glass but as he tried to focus his eyes on the symbols the lines seemed to shift and move about evading clarity. Before he could investigate it further Beth interrupted him by asking ""The gathering below the city?""  Her voice wavered ""Wha....What?""  Her hands were visibly shaking as she tried to read the rest of the journal entries.  But she couldn't bring herself to turn another page.  “Jonah?” Beth’s voice broke through his focus, pulling him back. The symbol lingered in his mind as he turned toward her.



“She never told me about any of this,” Beth whispered, her voice hollow. “I—I didn’t know she was meeting anyone.”  Crying Beth says ""I should have noticed something, why didn't I...""



“Whoever this person is,” Jonah said, his voice calm but firm, “they were trying to isolate her. Gain her trust.” He paused, his thoughts racing. “And they did a good job of it.”



Beth looked up at him, tears welling in her eyes. “What do we do now?”



Jonah stood, his mind already turning over the possibilities. “I’ll need to follow up on this gathering she mentioned. But first, I’m heading to her work and school. Someone there might know more.”



Beth nodded, clutching the journal tightly. “Please... find her,” she whispered, her voice cracking. She paused, then wiped her eyes and straightened her shoulders. “I don’t care what it takes. Just bring her back to me.”



Jonah caught the flicker of resolve in her eyes—a mother’s love burning through her grief. It was a small but vital shift, and it reminded him why he couldn’t afford to fail.



She held the journal out to Jonah, but her fingers tightened around it just before he could take it. For a moment, she froze, her gaze flickering between the journal and Jonah’s outstretched hand. Her lips trembled, and she drew a shaky breath.



“It’s the last piece of her I have,” she said, her voice barely audible.



Jonah hesitated, his hand hovering in the space between them. “I understand,” he said gently, his voice steady. “But this might be the key to finding her.”



Beth closed her eyes, a single tear slipping down her cheek. Finally, she released the journal, letting it drop into Jonah’s waiting hand. He gave her a small nod of reassurance, though his own unease deepened as his fingers brushed the cover, the now-familiar tingling sensation spreading like a phantom grime.



Jonah tried to give Beth a reassuring nod before stepping back into the hallway. He didn’t have the heart to tell her the darker thought lingering in the back of his mind: whoever this person was, they might not just have Julia—something told him that their intentions were far worse than abducting her. He didn’t understand how he knew this, but deep down, in his core, in his bones, he felt it. Julia was in danger.



As he descended the stairs, Jonah couldn’t shake the image of those smoky tendrils curling around Beth. He’d seen things before—things that didn’t make sense, things he could never explain. Maybe it was exhaustion, his mind playing tricks on him. Or maybe it was something worse.



The metallic tang in the air lingered on his tongue, gnawing at his senses like a warning. Whatever this was, it was getting under his skin.



His breath caught, and his hand instinctively went to his hip, searching for the weight of his Kimber. But it wasn’t there, and when he blinked, the tendrils were gone. Beth stood alone, her figure framed by the dim hallway light, her face a mask of worry and exhaustion.  



“Focus,” Jonah muttered under his breath, shaking his head as he turned away. Whatever he thought he saw, it didn’t matter. Not now. Not yet.



He reached his car, opened the door, and slid into the driver’s seat. The Caprice’s engine roared to life, the sound oddly comforting. Jonah looked back again and gave Beth a small wave, more of a gesture of reassurance than a farewell.  Beth nodded faintly, her expression unchanged.  The engine's hum filled the silence as Jonah pulled onto the street, his mind already turning to his next steps.





Chapter 6: Julia

Jonah arrived at K St. & 28th, parking across the street from the thrift store where Julia worked. The building was a weathered old Victorian house, one of many in the downtown area repurposed for commercial use. It was practical yet charming, its ornate exterior attempting to maintain the character of the neighborhood. Jonah examined the house from his car, taking in the faded light blue paint and the sagging porch that spoke of years of neglect. The sign above the entrance read “Timeless Treasures Thrift Shop,” its lettering faded and peeling from years of exposure to Sacramento’s sun and rain.



He stepped out of his car, his boots crunching against loose gravel as he crossed the street. The porch creaked under his weight as he climbed the steps, his eyes sweeping the surroundings. The house seemed to lean slightly, an unsettling effect that Jonah couldn’t ignore. As he reached for the door, the bell above it jingled softly, announcing his entrance.



The Thrift Store

The interior was dimly lit and cluttered, a narrow maze of secondhand goods. Racks of clothing crammed the aisles, while mismatched shelves groaned under the weight of knickknacks, old books, and outdated electronics. The air was thick with a musty odor, mingling with the faint scent of aged wood and dust.



Behind the counter stood a thin-framed man with graying hair. He peered over his round glasses at Jonah, his expression wary. His movements were deliberate as he placed a tattered paperback onto the counter and folded his arms.



“Can I help you with something?” the man asked, his tone curt, almost challenging.



Jonah offered a polite smile, keeping his tone friendly. “Good day. You just might be able to help me. My name’s Jonah Thorsen, and I’m a private investigator. I’m looking for Julia Farron.”



The man’s eyes narrowed slightly, his lips pressing into a thin line. “Private investigator, huh? Got anything to prove that? Anyone could walk in here and say they’re looking for her.”



Jonah nodded, unfazed. He reached into his jacket pocket and retrieved his ID, flipping it open to reveal his private investigator’s license. He held it up for the man to see. “Here you go. Everything’s legitimate.”



Roy adjusted his glasses and squinted at the card, studying it carefully. After a moment, he gave a curt nod. “You could be anyone claiming to look for her.  Times aren't what they used to be.”



“Of course,” Jonah replied with a reassuring nod, slipping the ID back into his pocket. His voice remained calm, though he noted the man’s wariness. “I get it.  Trust isn't easy to come by.”



Roy’s Insights into Julia

Roy hesitated, then answered Jonah’s questions reluctantly. “She missed her shift yesterday and this morning. Anything else?”



Jonah tilted his head, studying Roy. There was something about the man’s demeanor—a stiffness that didn’t seem entirely natural. “Did anything seem unusual the last time you saw her? Did she mention anyone or seem distracted?”



Roy shifted his weight, adjusting his glasses again. “She wasn’t herself the last couple of weeks,” he admitted. “Kept looking over her shoulder like she thought someone was following her. Didn’t talk much, either. Not like her.”



“What do you mean, ‘not like her’?” Jonah asked.



Roy rubbed the back of his neck, his brow furrowed. “Julia’s always been dependable—shows up on time, does her work, even chats with the customers. But lately... she seemed distracted. Nervous, even. Like her mind was somewhere else.”



Jonah nodded, his expression thoughtful. “Did you notice anyone coming around to see her? Someone she might’ve been meeting?”



Roy hesitated, his brows furrowing as he glanced out the window. “She had this friend who started showing up a few weeks ago. Always waiting for her outside—by the porch or the side yard. Never came inside.”



“Do you remember what they looked like?” Jonah asked, leaning slightly closer.



“That’s the thing,” Roy said, his voice lowering. “I can’t. I saw them a few times, but it’s like... I can’t picture them clearly. Dark clothes, I think. Could’ve been a guy or a girl. Hard to say. But they made my skin crawl. Something about them just felt... off.”



Jonah filed the comment away, his frown deepening.



The Office and Locker

“Do you have security cameras?” Jonah asked after a pause. “I’d like to take a look at the footage if that’s possible.”



Roy sighed, pulling out a key from his pocket. “Yeah, but it’s an old system. Footage isn’t great. Follow me.”



Roy led Jonah through a narrow hallway to a cramped office at the back of the house. The room smelled of stale coffee and damp paper. An outdated monitor sat on the desk, its screen flickering faintly as Roy powered it on. “Here,” Roy muttered, pulling up the feed from a week ago. “This should show her last shift.”



Jonah leaned over Roy’s shoulder, watching as the grainy footage played. At first, everything seemed normal—Julia greeting customers, folding clothes, and tidying shelves. Then came a moment when she stepped outside, glancing around as though expecting someone. A figure emerged from the shadows near the porch, but their features were indistinct, blurred even when they stood close to Julia.



“Why are they out of focus?” Jonah asked, his voice sharper than he intended.



Roy shrugged. “I don’t know. The system’s old, sure, but it shouldn’t do that. Look—” He fast-forwarded to another day. The same figure appeared, and again, their face and body were blurred, as though the camera couldn’t capture them properly.



As the footage progressed, Jonah noticed something even more unsettling. The distortion seemed to spread to Julia in the more recent clips. Her figure became hazy, her movements less distinct, until it was difficult to even recognize her.



“What the hell…” Jonah murmured, his eyes narrowing. He clenched his jaw, his mind racing with possibilities.



“Does Julia have a locker here?” Jonah asked after a pause. “Somewhere she kept personal belongings?”



Roy nodded. “Yeah, in the stockroom. I’ll show you.”



In the stockroom, Roy gestured to a battered locker. Jonah opened it and found a few personal items: a water bottle, a small notebook with Julia’s name scrawled on the cover, and a silver necklace with a delicate charm. But his attention was drawn to the inside of the locker door, where a strange symbol had been carved into the metal.



His brow furrowed as he traced the lines, a faint oily sensation clinging to his fingers. It was the same symbol he’d seen on Julia’s bedroom window. He snapped a photo with his phone, his unease deepening.



The Unease

As Jonah returned to the office to collect the DVD, he noticed Roy standing eerily still, watching him. The man’s eyes seemed almost too focused, like he was trying to see through Jonah rather than look at him. For a brief moment, Jonah caught the man mimicking his posture—the same tilt of the head, the same hand resting lightly on the desk.



“You alright?” Jonah asked, his voice cautious.



Roy blinked, his expression unreadable. “Fine,” he said flatly, his tone subtly shifting to echo Jonah’s speech pattern.



Jonah’s chest tightened, but he forced himself to remain calm. “Thanks for your help,” he said, keeping his tone measured. He turned and walked out, his footsteps steady despite the knot tightening in his stomach.



When he reached his car, Jonah hesitated at the driver’s side door, glancing back toward the thrift store. Roy was standing at the counter, motionless, his face unreadable in the dim light filtering through the windows. A shiver ran down Jonah’s spine as he slid into the driver’s seat and closed the door.



Adjusting the rearview mirror, Jonah caught a fleeting glimpse of Roy through the glass. For a split second, Roy’s reflection wasn’t his own—it was Jonah’s face staring back at him, cold and impassive.



Jonah’s breath caught in his throat, and he blinked, gripping the wheel. When he looked again, it was gone.



Shaking his head, Jonah turned the key in the ignition. The engine sputtered to life, its low rumble grounding him as he took a slow, measured breath. He pulled onto K Street, leaving the thrift store behind. Whatever had just happened in there, he wasn’t sticking around to find out.



Chapter 7: Sac State



Jonah turned onto J Street, the hum of the city fading as he entered Sacramento State University’s sprawling campus. The late afternoon light cast long shadows over the pathways, and the scattered groups of students seemed a world apart from the grim task Jonah had set for himself. He parked in the visitor’s lot and stepped out, tugging his jacket tighter against the crisp breeze.



The humanities building loomed ahead, its modern façade incongruous against the campus’s more traditional structures. Jonah strode through its double doors, his boots echoing on the tiled floor. He paused briefly at a campus directory and located Dr. Emory Caldwell’s office—second floor, end of the hall. Jonah made his way up the stairs, his mind already forming the questions he’d need to ask.



Meeting Dr. Caldwell



The brass plaque on the door read: Dr. Emory Caldwell, Theology and Comparative Mythology. Jonah knocked firmly and waited. A moment later, a voice called out, “Come in!”



The office was a cramped space, walls lined with overflowing bookshelves and a desk piled high with papers, journals, and open books. The air smelled faintly of old parchment and leather. Behind the desk sat a man in his mid-fifties, salt-and-pepper hair neatly combed and wire-rimmed glasses perched on his nose. He looked up from his work, his expression curious but not unkind.



“Yes?” the professor asked, setting his pen down.



Jonah offered a polite nod as he stepped inside. “Dr. Caldwell? My name’s Jonah Thorsen. I’m a private investigator. I’m looking into the disappearance of one of your students, Julia Farron.”



Caldwell’s brows furrowed slightly. “Julia? Yes, I know her. She’s in my theology and mythology seminar.” He set down his pen, his expression shifting to one of concern. “What can I do to assist?”



Uncovering Julia’s Shift



Jonah sat, leaning forward slightly. “I’d like to know if you noticed any changes in her behavior recently. Did she seem distracted, upset? Anything out of the ordinary?”



Dr. Caldwell removed his glasses and pinched the bridge of his nose, thinking. “Julia has always been an exceptional student. Bright, inquisitive, eager to explore difficult topics. But now that you mention it... over the past few weeks, there was a noticeable change in her demeanor.”



Jonah’s interest sharpened. “What kind of change?”



“She became... preoccupied. Her questions in class shifted from academic curiosity to something more personal. She seemed particularly focused on esoteric texts—works like the Grimorium Verum and The Key of Solomon. She asked about the nature of spirits and rituals. It struck me as unusual, but not necessarily alarming. Many students are drawn to the darker aspects of mythology.”



Jonah’s brow furrowed. Reaching into his bag, he retrieved the weathered copy of Julia’s Grimorium Verum. His fingers curled in discomfort as he touched the book, the sensation like a slick grime coating his skin. He grimaced, placing it on Caldwell’s desk with a noticeable reluctance.



Dr. Caldwell’s eyes widened slightly as he recognized the title. He leaned forward, his expression one of cautious curiosity. “Her copy?” he asked softly.



Jonah nodded. “I found it in her locker at work. There are notes scribbled throughout. Erratic ones.”



Caldwell opened the book carefully, his brow furrowing deeper as he scanned the pages. “She became quite fixated,” he said quietly. “The Grimorium Verum is infamous among grimoires, not only for its content but for the obsessive fascination it seems to inspire in those who study it. She was delving into rituals and summoning, subjects that—frankly—are ill-suited for anyone without proper grounding. For those who believe in this sort of magic, that is.”



Jonah leaned forward. “Did she ever mention why she was interested in this? Or if someone was encouraging her?”



Dr. Caldwell nodded slowly. “She mentioned a friend—someone who, in her words, ‘opened her eyes to new possibilities.’ I asked her for more details, but she was evasive. Said it wasn’t important.”



Jonah’s jaw tightened. “Did she ever seem frightened? Like she was in over her head?”



The professor hesitated, his gaze distant. “Not frightened, no. But she did seem uncharacteristically excited. As if she were being drawn toward something she didn’t fully understand. I remember one day, she stayed after class to ask about protection rituals. Specifically, how one might guard themselves against malevolent entities.”



Jonah scoffed, a wry smile tugging at his lips. “Protection rituals?”



Caldwell’s expression turned serious. “Many ancient cultures revered individuals who could perceive what others could not. They believed knowledge of the mystical world came with both enlightenment and danger.”



Jonah filed the comment away but didn’t respond directly. Instead, he asked, “Do you know if she was close to anyone in your class? Someone I could talk to?”



Dr. Caldwell’s eyes lit up slightly. “Yes, actually. She often worked with two study partners, Mia and Derek. They’re bright students, and the three of them frequently collaborated. They might have insight.”



“Could you introduce me?” Jonah asked, his tone steady.



Caldwell nodded. “They’re likely in the library this time of day. Let me take you to them.”



A Subtle Warning



The professor stood, closing the Grimorium Verum carefully and handing it back to Jonah, who grimaced again as he tucked it into his bag. Together, they exited the office, the echo of their footsteps filling the quiet hallway.



As they walked, Caldwell glanced at Jonah. “If I may offer a word of caution?”



Jonah inclined his head. “Of course.”



Caldwell: (with a touch of gravity) ""These studies have shown me the thin line between belief and obsession. When someone dives too deep, the darkness they seek often finds them first."" Whether or not these forces are real, the consequences often are. Be careful where you tread.”



Jonah nodded, his voice reflective ""So, you're saying Julia might have been in over her head without knowing it?”



Dr. Caldwell paused before saying ""Based off of what you've presented me with today, it certainly seems like a fascination became an obsession.  Let me introduce you to some of her classmates.""  With that Dr. Caldwell got up and walked Jonah to the library.



Meeting Julia’s Classmates

The library’s high ceilings and quiet hum of activity created an atmosphere of focus. Dr. Caldwell guided Jonah to a secluded table near the back where two students sat huddled over a stack of books and notes. A young woman with curly brown hair and glasses looked up first, followed by a lanky young man with a mop of dark hair. Both appeared startled when Caldwell approached.



“Mia, Derek,” Caldwell began, his tone gentle but commanding. “This is Mr. Jonah Thorsen, a private investigator. He’s looking into Julia’s disappearance and believes you might be able to help.”



Mia’s eyes widened in alarm. “Disappearance? Julia’s missing?”



Jonah stepped forward, softening his voice to calm her concern. “I’m working to piece together her whereabouts over the last few days. I was hoping you could tell me if she mentioned anything unusual recently. Places she planned to go, people she might have met.”



Derek frowned, exchanging a worried glance with Mia before speaking. “She did mention a pop-up rave in Old Sacramento. Asked if we wanted to go. She said... she’d heard it was life-changing.”



Jonah’s pen stilled over his notebook. Old Sacramento again. The tunnels, the eerie connections, all of it seemed to lead back there. He muttered under his breath, “I really need to track down this pop-up rave.”



“Did she say who told her about it?” Jonah asked, lifting his gaze to the pair. “Or did you see her talking to anyone new?”



Mia adjusted her glasses, a small crease forming between her brows. “Not really. She just said someone she trusted invited her, but she wouldn’t give a name. It was weird—she’s usually so open with us.”



“Yeah,” Derek chimed in. “She’d been acting different. Not in a bad way, exactly, but she seemed... distracted. Like her mind was somewhere else.”



Jonah nodded, leaning forward. “Different how? Did she seem scared or anxious?”



“Not scared,” Mia said carefully, choosing her words. “More like... obsessed? Like she was searching for something important.”



Derek’s expression darkened. “I saw her with someone once, near the quad. They were sitting on one of the benches, talking. Julia looked... captivated. I couldn’t see the other person’s face clearly, though. They were dressed all in black, like a long coat or something. Gave me the creeps.”



Mia nodded. “She didn’t tell us who they were. Just said they were ‘helping her understand.’ I tried to ask more, but she brushed me off.”



Jonah jotted down their words, his mind racing to connect the dots. He handed each of them a business card. “If you think of anything else—anything at all—please call me.”



Mia took the card, her fingers trembling slightly. “Do you think she’s okay?”



Jonah hesitated before replying, choosing his words carefully. “I’m doing everything I can to find her. Thank you for your help.”



Mia and Derek nodded solemnly, their worry palpable as Jonah turned to leave. Dr. Caldwell trailed behind him, the concern in his own expression mirroring theirs.



Chapter 8: The Next Step

The sun was setting as Jonah drove away from Sacramento State, the shadows on the street stretching long and thin. He replayed the interviews with Julia’s mythology professor and her classmates in his head, the fragments of their conversations tumbling over one another like puzzle pieces that refused to fit.



Dr. Caldwell’s academic caution about belief and reality lingered in Jonah’s mind. And then there was Derek and Mia—Julia’s study partners—who’d spoken about her growing fascination with the occult and the mysterious pop-up rave in Old Sacramento. The word “captivated” stuck with Jonah like a burr.



Jonah sighed, rubbing his temple as he pulled to the side of the road. He opened his notebook, flipping through his hastily scribbled notes. He underlined two things: friend in black and a rave in Old Sacramento.



Something about this case felt heavier than others. It gnawed at his gut, a faint but persistent ache that refused to let go.



He tapped Beth Farron’s name in his phone and brought it to his ear. She answered on the second ring.



“Mr. Thorsen,” Beth said, her voice tight with barely concealed desperation. “Did you find something?”



“Beth,” Jonah said evenly, “I was wondering if you’re available to talk tonight. I’ve found some things that might make sense to you, and I want to make sure I haven’t missed anything.”



“I—yes, of course,” Beth replied. “Please, come over.”



Returning to Beth

The apartment was quiet when Jonah arrived, the dim glow of a lamp visible through the window. Beth greeted him at the door, her face pale and drawn, her eyes rimmed red from lack of sleep and tears. She offered a polite smile, but it was strained, her lips trembling as though the effort to appear composed was too great.



“Have you found anything about where Julia may have gone?” she asked immediately, her voice trembling, almost breaking.



Jonah gave her a reassuring nod. “I’ve uncovered a few things that might help us piece things together, but I need your input.” He followed her inside, noting the faint scent of lavender, likely from the diffuser on the counter. Beth motioned for him to sit, but her movements were jerky and hesitant, as if her body couldn’t keep up with her racing thoughts.



The coffee table was crowded with photo albums and notebooks. Jonah glanced at the open pages—pictures of a younger Julia, her bright smile framed by long hair that spilled over her shoulders. Beth sat across from him, clutching a tissue in one hand while her other tapped anxiously against her knee. Jonah studied her discreetly, noting the deepening lines around her mouth and the hollow look in her eyes.



She’s unraveling, Jonah thought grimly. The weight of Julia’s disappearance was clearly taking a toll, and while Beth’s concern was genuine, her mental state seemed increasingly fragile.



“Today, I went to Julia’s workplace and her school,” Jonah began gently. “At the thrift store, I spoke with her manager, Roy. He mentioned a... friend Julia had been meeting—he couldn't accurately describe this individual for me.  Roy gave me a copy of the security footage, there were some inconsistencies in the footage but, I'll continue to review it when I get back to the office and see if anything stands out.”



Beth’s brow furrowed as she wrung the tissue between her fingers. “I don’t know of any new friends... but Julia was keeping things from me.  I don't know how I didn't notice something sooner, maybe I didn't want to see the changes” Her voice wavered, a mixture of guilt and frustration slipping through her words.



Jonah reached into his bag and pulled out the Grimorium Verum. “Do you recognize this?” he asked gently. “I found it in her locker at work. It’s filled with notes, handwritten by Julia.”



Beth’s eyes widened as she stared at the worn cover, her hands stilling in her lap. “She never mentioned anything like that. What is it?”



“It’s a book tied to occult practices,” Jonah explained, keeping his voice even. “Did you notice her reading something similar or talking about... unusual subjects?”



Beth shook her head slowly. “No. But she became so distant in the last few months, I—” She stopped as Jonah placed the book on the coffee table.



The air in the room shifted, thickening like a sudden drop in pressure. Jonah’s chest tightened, and the edges of his vision felt strangely dimmed. Across from him, Beth’s expression went slack, her lips parting as if to speak, though no sound came out.



“Beth?” Jonah asked, his voice taut.



Her eyes were glassy, her tone flat and mechanical when she finally spoke. “I....I...I've never seen this before, I'm not sure what you’re talking about.”



Jonah’s stomach knotted as he observed her closely. Her pallor seemed to deepen, her shoulders sagging as if under some invisible weight. Is it the stress? he wondered. Or is this something more?



Quickly, Jonah picked up the book and slipped it back into his bag. The oppressive feeling lifted almost immediately, and Beth blinked rapidly, her expression returning to one of concern. She rubbed her forehead and looked at Jonah, confused. “What were we talking about?” she asked, her voice trembling.



Jonah forced a smile, though his mind raced with questions. “Just asking if there’s anyone new Julia might have confided in. Someone in the area she might have trusted?”



Beth hesitated, then shook her head. “Not directly. But recently, she’d disappear for hours at a time without saying where she was going. And once, she said she’d found ‘a place where time stands still.’ I thought it was just... a poetic way of describing somewhere she liked, but now...” Beth’s voice trailed off, her eyes searching Jonah’s face for reassurance, though none came. “It’s probably nothing, right?”



Jonah jotted down her words, his face unreadable. “Maybe,” he said cautiously. “But I’ve learned that even the smallest details can be important.”



Beth nodded silently, her hands now clutching the tissue so tightly that it had begun to tear. As Jonah left the apartment, he couldn’t shake the image of her vacant stare when the Grimorium Verum was on the table. Was it merely the weight of her grief? Or had the book—whatever it represented—elicited something deeper, something darker?



The Routine

The next morning, Jonah retraced Julia’s steps. He started with her favorite café, a small hole-in-the-wall place tucked between office buildings. The barista behind the counter was friendly, though visibly puzzled when Jonah introduced himself.



“Julia?” she repeated, her brow furrowed. “I know her—she used to come in pretty often, but I haven’t seen her in a while.”



Jonah leaned on the counter slightly. “Did you ever notice her with anyone? Someone she didn’t usually come in with?”



The barista’s face lit with recognition. “Actually, yeah. About a week ago, she came in with someone. They were dressed all in black—kind of stood out. I remember thinking they had this... intense vibe.”



“What do you mean by ‘intense’?” Jonah asked, his pen poised over his notebook.



The barista shrugged, her expression thoughtful. “It’s hard to explain. Like, they didn’t say much, but you could feel their presence. They gave her something—a note or a flyer, I think—and I overheard something about ‘the river’ and ‘tunnels.’ It was weird.”



Jonah’s pen stilled. The river and the tunnels. Old Sacramento again. He closed his notebook and offered the barista a polite smile. “Thanks. That’s helpful.”



Back in his car, Jonah stared at his notes, the words swimming before his eyes. The puzzle pieces were falling into place, but the picture they formed was anything but comforting. Old Sacramento kept surfacing like a shadow that wouldn’t be banished. The barista’s mention of tunnels sent a chill down his spine.



Jonah exhaled sharply and started the car. There was more work to be done, but the threads of this case were pulling him inexorably toward the city’s dark underbelly—and whatever waited there.",1,1751510884.0,u_Ashamed-Hedgehog1259,0,1.0,False

A year ago I was pushing 290 lbs and got on a GLP-1. I don’t know if I associate my energy levels with that weight loss journey or not, but for the last year or so I been lacking major energy. I wake up tired because I have to and because I know I won’t be getting any more/better sleep just laying there awake. I have real painful esophageal reflux issues that caused my last ENT to say “I can literally see chemical burns on your vocal chords”, but 4 different GIs and two different probes in 15 years have said no abnormal reflux in the lower esophagus. I’ve also found myself having to wake up and pee once, sometimes twice a night for the last 4-6 years regardless of watching fluid intake before bedtime. No booze, 2 cups of coffee and water/iced tea/soda for lunch. 

I’m at the point where I’m having to lay down on my office couch after lunch and again in the evening either before or after dinner. Weekends bring no relief.

I just took this WatchPAT test through GEM Sleep about a month ago and I’m not really sure how to interpret it. I wasn’t able to fall asleep on my back (I rarely sleep on my back, and when I do I end up waking up on my side) so I spent the night on my side. I didn’t feel like I was able to sleep well because the dang finger probe kept rubbing against a cut cuticle, which frustrated the dickens out of me all night. 

GEM Sleep just sent me an email and said “your test didn’t say you have sleep apnea”. They then said I could book another billable appointment to discuss further options. I got the impression they were trying to sell dental retainers so I just left it at that. 

At pAHI 4.7 I feel like I was borderline and a longer test / more normal night of sleep might have been more representative. I didn’t even pick up on the pRDIs until a month later when I had to pay a bill and decided to throw the test into ChatGPT for fun just to see if it could interpret anything… Now I have no idea what to do. The AI says “your symptoms and test results describe classic UARS, go get an in-lab test”. It also says the best treatment for UARS is CPAP, and my test was almost borderline for OSA. If I go in-lab, I’m guessing I’m spending at least $1,500. I’m tempted to just order another $150 home test using a different testing device like a nightowl and see if I can’t get a result with pAHI over 5 and an OSA Rx to-go for sleep apnea. Has anybody got any advice? I’m pretty beat… 

Also, can I take Ambien with these tests? I have an Rx that I don’t use much, but I think I do tend to have a bit better sleep when I do. I don’t use it much because I’m afraid of it being habit-forming.",1,1751510796.0,UARSnew,1,1.0,False
1lqen4f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lqen4f,Mima's Mediterranean in Saint Vincent Place (DTLA): The Best Casual Middle Eastern Spot in Downtown,"A couple months ago I queried this sub about the best shawarma in LA County. My report is nearly complete; I will post it here in the next couple of weeks.

For now, I just want to profile a wonderful spot that to my knowledge has never been mentioned on this sub: Mima's Mediterranean in Saint Vincent Court. This place has a large menu featuring affordable Syrian Armenian cuisine. Their chicken shawarma is really good. Very attractive presentation, good portion size. Today I had their adana kebab special, which was also great! My typical go-to for this dish is the Baba Kebab, the street cart on Sunset at Figueroa in front of the Orsini Apartments. They are both must-tries. Not only are they both among the best in LA, the two places also exhibit different regional/ethnic takes on what is superficially the same dish.

Further to its credit is the ambience. [Saint Vincent Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Vincent%27s_Place) was established in the late 1860s as an early campus of what is now Loyola Marymount University. At some point it was remodeled to mimic a European square. It's delightfully garish, (an excellent example of LA being *so* LA by trying to be so not LA) and actually a rare cozy place to sit and enjoy a meal on a day like today in the clean and mostly car-free alley, and watch men drink tea, and well-fed attractive cohort of pigeons waddle around, all without being accosted with the smell of urine.

The folks who work there are super nice as well. My only complaint is that it closes so early; the alley would be a great place to hang out at nice (I am imagining offerings of shisha, tea, coffee, and beer, with or without an oud player...)

Check it out and let us know what you think! Of what I have tried, it is definitely the best casual Middle Eastern spot in downtown. 9/10",14,1751510794.0,FoodLosAngeles,5,0.9,False

The ride to Kampala went by smoothly. I gathered my luggage as the train began to slow its approach into the Kampala Space Elevator’s rail station. The signage pointing the way from the platforms to the actual elevator terminal of the facility could have been clearer, but I had gone through there enough times by then to remember where I needed to go. After checking my luggage, I settled into a seat among a sea of other travelers waiting for a boarding announcement. I had spent winter break at home with my family, and now I was returning to university for the spring semester.

A voice came over the intercom and announced that boarding had begun. A line formed near the door, and one by one, each of us was confirmed to board the elevator cabin waiting on the other side. The accommodations were not as comfortable as those on the train, but the climb up the cable usually took less than an hour anyway. The curved sides of the cabin featured great big windows through which only a steel wall could be observed. As we started to ascend, however, the Kampala skyline came into view, and I watched as the landscape began to fall further and further below. This was always my favorite part.

First it was people that shrank from view, then buildings, then entire city blocks. We rose above the height of airplanes and the distant horizon began to curve. To the south, I could see the other side of Lake Victoria. In the north, the verdant plains of the Ugandan countryside. Even the snowy peaks of Mt. Kenya and Kilimanjaro far to the east were visible. The vistas were so mesmerizing that the shoulders of strangers pushing against my own almost didn’t bother me.

We neared the orbital ring above, and I could feel the elevator decelerating. After docking to the airlock, the door opened and we were cleared to enter the ring terminal. I navigated to the baggage claim and waited for my bags to appear on the conveyor belt, a process that took far longer than it should have. Eventually, I acquired my belongings and made my way to an information board. Glancing through a nearby window, I was disappointed to find that the sun had already set. I enjoyed watching the terminator crawl across the surface of the planet. Still, viewing the Earth during the night was its own spectacle.

Directly below was the glowing metropolis of Kampala, a great mass of golden light surrounded by hundreds of smaller stars shining more brightly than the ones above. Closer to eye level, near the horizon, another blotch of light stood out among the rest. I determined that this must have been Addis Ababa, where I had been just hours before. I wouldn’t see it again for months, and I suddenly lamented how long I would have to wait to have home cooking again. My sambusas never came out as good as Dad’s.

My shuttle was set to depart in a couple hours, so after once again checking my luggage, I found dinner at the station’s many food vendors before the third boarding call of the day. The worst part of space travel had to be the endless transfers. The lack of large windows on the shuttle made this ride the least interesting of them all, and I spent most of my time on it reading the book I brought in my carry-on specially for that reason.

As the shuttle accelerated more and more, I felt the pull of gravity lessen and lessen, and the straps across my torso became the only things preventing my body from lifting into the air. The shuttle reached a speed of over seven kilometers per second, hovering mere centimeters above a maglev track, itself suspended hundreds of kilometers above the surface of the Earth. People have tried to explain to me the physics of how it all works, but it never made sense. In fact, I preferred to think about it as little as possible.

The shuttle, now weightless, disconnected from the track and gently floated upward. Small reaction thrusters adjusted its orbital trajectory. “Rendezvous and docking with spaceliner *al-Idrisi* bound for Anorizopolis in approximately one hour and twenty minutes” the intercom assured. *That’ll be the final leg,* I thought to myself. *At least for today.* I was already exhausted. I left home nearly ten hours earlier, and yet the spaceliner trip would take another forty or so. At the very least, most of the stress was behind me.

The shuttle docked with the *al-Idrisi* and we passengers were directed through narrow corridors into the ship’s interior. Many might have found the environment inside to be claustrophobic, but open, spacious rooms made for difficult navigation in microgravity. Handles and railings lined most surfaces to facilitate easier movement, and I was given complimentary shoes sporting fastener soles. I made it to my designated cabin where I was told I would soon receive my luggage.

It was enough space to stretch my arms and legs, but not so cavernous that I could find myself floating beyond reach of a grippable surface. Being able to use all six sides of the room for equipment and storage also made it seem bigger than it actually was. A small porthole was the only window to the outside, not that there was much more to see than the empty abyss of space. The sun was in view, and seeing it against a pure black backdrop instead of the familiar baby blue sky was unnerving. I closed the blinds.

The interior lighting was dim and warm, meant to invoke fire or lamplight to convince the body that it was nearing time for sleep. An attendant arrived and handed over my belongings. After changing my clothes and using the microgravity bathroom to the best of my ability, I strapped myself into a sleeping bag attached to the wall and settled in for the night. The ship’s ventilation and distant nuclear engines hummed quietly, and it didn’t take long for me to fall asleep. I found that the weightlessness did wonders for my back.

I had a full day onboard the *al-Idrisi.* With no proper showers, bathing consisted of wiping myself down with an absorbent towel soaked in soapy water. After getting dressed, I made it to the dining hall, where breakfast was served in sealed packages attached to trays with fastener strips. Morning coffee came in the form of a squeezable pouch and a straw. These were the aspects of microgravity I enjoyed the least. If I were on a multi-week long voyage to Mars or the Asteroid Belt, I might have made use of the spaceliner’s zero-G sports facilities or movie theater, but given the short duration, I mainly occupied myself with a book in my private cabin. I did make sure to check out the observation deck, however.

A transparent hemisphere protruded beyond the ship’s bulkhead, and unlike the view from my cabin porthole, the sun’s glare was not present to obscure the cosmos. This was no void, no inky nothingness. It was full of glowing points of light, many white, some yellow, others orange, blue, or red. The great arm of the Milky Way reached across the scape appearing like a luminescent scar, softly glowing in deep, warm colors. I’ve left the city to see the galaxy on clear nights before, but only up here, without the haze of the atmosphere, does it look as though I could reach out with my hand and wave away the starry mist. This wasn’t the first time I’ve made this trek, and it surely wouldn’t be the last. Although the pains of traveling never ceased to drain me of my energy, I always loved the views.

The next morning, I left my luggage fastened to the wall just outside my cabin door as instructed. Typically I prefer moving my own luggage myself, but the weightlessness made this an order of magnitude more complicated. The next time I would see it, I would be in Anorizopolis. The *al-Idrisi* was berthed in the massive habitat’s spaceport, and I was directed, along with the hordes of everyone else, to the passenger loading deck. Realistically, there was less than an hour until my journey was finally completed, but being so close to the end made every minute feel that much longer.

I was corralled into a packed people mover car where I was instructed to strap myself into a seat. We we whisked away, and through a glass canopy, I saw the pressurized section of the spaceport, a chaotic labyrinth where both passenger and cargo were constantly in motion. The car passed through the industrial infrastructure before coming to a stop. The car and the track it was attached to began to ever so slightly roll in a clockwise direction, and then it continued forward into a tunnel. A blinding light suddenly forced me to squint my eyes, and as they adjusted, I saw a world wrapped in on itself.

Looking below, it appeared very much like Earth, with a mixture of crop fields and green forests, only this landscape curved upwards on both my left and right sides until converging again upside down, up above. Far ahead of me, this cylindrical geometry stretched until a distant cap closed the shape. The central axis was occupied by an industrial bar, beaming bright, yellow-tinged light all around the habitat. Roughly equidistant between my current vantage point and the far end cap laid a sprawling city situated beside a large lake. This lake crawled up the sides of the landscape, curving until meeting itself high above, forming a ring shape. The tallest buildings were concentrated around the Suntower, a structure pencil-thin at this distance and reaching all the way to the central axis bar. I had finally made it to Anorizopolis.

The car had stopped on a large platform that it shared with many other vehicles, some other people movers, others freight vehicles. A mechanical whirring sounded, and the platform began to slowly descend down an incline. As it did, I slowly sank deeper into my seat as the sensation of gravity returned. Only, this was spin gravity, a fictitious force that mimicked the pull of a planet’s surface. Turning my head too quickly made its discrepancies dizzyingly apparent. It always took a few days for my sense of balance to adapt. I heard the retching of other passengers, and I silently pleaded that the companion to my side did not join in.

The platform reached the ground below, and cars began moving into a terminal. There, the doors opened and I stepped off and followed the crowd. After collecting my luggage that had already been received earlier, found my way to the train platforms. I got on the next train scheduled to depart for the City of Anorizopolis. Hauling my belongings onto a luggage rack, I collapsed into a seat. This was it. This was the last ride. No more trains, elevators, spaceships, whatevers. I’d be done.

I leaned against the window as the train started to move forward. I watched vineyards and other fields pass by, interrupted by the occasional bridge or wildlife crossing. Looking up, more landscapes hung from above. A river clung to the ceiling, meandering between farms, villages, and forests of alder and oak trees. Swallows, long since acclimated to the strange conditions, floated close to the central axis where the simulated force of gravity was weaker. They used their wings to swim through the air more so than fly. A group in the row in front of me were pointing and gawking. *Tourists,* I thought to myself. *Not that I can blame them.*

The rural scenery gave way to increasing human development. For being such an otherworldly place, most of the buildings here were rather modest. Brick, concrete, and wood were common materials, and few structures were outwardly extravagant. One could have thought they were in any number of Earth’s cities, if only they refrained from peering upward. It was only in the city’s urban center where architects took advantage of the low-weight environment near the central axis. That was the only reason the Suntower could stand so tall.

The train made a number of stops along the way. The first few were in rustic villages with only a handful of buildings surrounding a central plaza. These were replaced by more densely packed neighborhoods, with buildings rising to three, four, and five stories. Many featured storefronts, restaurants, cafes, and clinics on their ground floors. The train passed by an urban garden, an outdoor art festival, a farmers’ market, and a gathering of street food vendors. I watched as some people got off the train and others got on. Some brought with them bicycles, bags of groceries, or babies in strollers. One group even carried a collection of musical instruments.

Not much later, the train pulled into the O’Neill University stop, only a few kilometers from downtown. There, I exited and found myself back on campus. I went straight to my dorm. My roommates hadn’t arrived yet, thankfully. That wasn’t to say I didn’t want to see them again, but I simply lacked the energy for it. Deciding I would leave unpacking for later, I fell onto my bed. I had enough traveling.

The woods were a labyrinth of shadows and whispers, the trees looming like sentinels under the faint glow of the moon. Jonah’s small legs pumped furiously, his breath ragged as he sprinted through the underbrush, his bare feet scraping against roots and rocks. “Rachel!” he shouted, his voice breaking with desperation.



The night seemed to swallow his cries, the silence pressing against him like a heavy blanket. He stumbled over a fallen branch, landing hard on his knees, but he scrambled up, brushing dirt and leaves from his hands. “Rachel!” he yelled again, his throat burning from the effort.



And then, faintly, he heard her.



“Jonah! Help me!”



Her voice was distant, carried on the wind, but unmistakable. Jonah’s heart surged, hope flickering like a fragile flame. He turned toward the sound and ran harder, ignoring the sting of tears in his eyes.



The forest thickened around him, the branches clawing at his arms as he pushed forward. He called out again, his voice cracking, but this time, there was no response.



Silence.



The kind that felt alive, as if the woods themselves were holding their breath. Jonah slowed to a stop, his chest heaving, his small hands clutching at his sides. The stillness stretched on, suffocating, until a new sound reached his ears.



It was faint at first—a low hum, almost like a distant vibration. It grew louder, resonating in his chest, the ground beneath him trembling slightly. Jonah turned in circles, his wide eyes scanning the darkness for his sister. “Rachel?” he whispered, his voice trembling.



But she was gone.



2:00 A.M. — The Ceremony

Preface: 2:00 A.M. — The Ceremony

The girl was roused from her cot by a gentle shake. A woman leaned in, whispering, “It’s time, love. You finally get to meet the Prophet.” Despite the soothing tone, a chill settled in her stomach. She rose, shivering as she rinsed herself with freezing water—common practice on the commune—and then allowed the woman to brush her hair. When the task was done, the girl stepped into ceremonial robes of thin, scratchy fabric.



A path of frost-ridden straw stretched across the yard, leading toward the Prophet’s root cellar. The girl followed the woman in silence, her breath fogging the bitter air. It was her eighteenth birthday—she had lived with this ""family"" as long as she could remember. Raised being told that she had a purpose, she was destined to do great things, and this was the night she would fulfill a fate she’d been told was hers. She didn’t want to be the vessel, but the woman who raised her—her surrogate mother—kept insisting that she was special, that the Prophet needed her, and once she became this vessel, they would all be elevated with her.



They reached a squat, wooden door. From somewhere below came the dull glow of candlelight and the low murmur of chanting. “Onoskelis, Onoskelis…” The sound made her heart pound. The woman drew the heavy door open, and a gust of stale, earthy air washed over them.



A narrow flight of creaking steps led down into a cramped cellar lit by half-melted candles. Pagan symbols adorned the walls, their crude lines flickering in the unsteady light. The air was heavy with the pungent mix of damp soil, burning wax, and the smoke of a bitter incense wafting from the priest’s brazier.



The girl hesitated at the bottom of the stairs, her eyes darting toward the symbols and the scrawled pentagrams surrounding her. The chanting grew louder, insistent: “Onoskelis, Onoskelis, Onoskelis…”



“Come,” the Prophet said, his voice smooth and commanding. He stood in the center of the room, draped in robes that seemed too pristine for the filth around him. “It is time.”



Slightly shivering, the girl turned toward the woman, her eyes wide and pleading. Please, she thought, willing the woman to see her fear, to save her from this nightmare. I don’t want this—I’m not ready. But the woman’s expression remained steady, filled with reverence and pride. Her silence was a stark answer: there would be no escape.



Choking back tears, the girl forced herself forward, her limbs heavy with dread.



The Prophet gestured for her to kneel within a pentagram painted in drying blood. The girl did as she was told, the stickiness clinging to her bare skin as she sank to the ground.



The priest approached, carrying a wooden cup. The liquid inside was dark and bitter-smelling, flecks of herbs clinging to the rim. “Drink,” the Prophet commanded. “It will prepare you.”



Her hands trembled as she took the cup. She brought it to her lips, hesitating as the scent hit her nose—a mix of rot and something faintly sweet. The Prophet’s sharp gaze bore into her, leaving no room for refusal. Closing her eyes, she drank, the acrid liquid burning as it slid down her throat.



Warmth spread through her limbs, heavy and oppressive. Her heart raced, pounding in her ears as her vision blurred and twisted. Shapes around her began to warp: shadows elongated, symbols on the walls seemed to writhe. The chanting grew louder, faster, until it drowned out her own frantic breathing.



“Onoskelis, Onoskelis, Great King Solomon, we beseech thee for guidance,” the Prophet intoned. “Onoskelis, we summon thee.”



The girl swayed, her head spinning as if the room itself had come alive. A dark shape began to take form at the edge of her vision, amorphous and shifting. It hovered near the ceiling, its movements erratic and unnatural.



Tendrils of shadow reached for her, brushing her skin, cold and unyielding, before curling around her body. She gasped, clawing at her throat as an unbearable pressure constricted her lungs. Her vision darkened, and her body convulsed. The last sound she heard before falling into blackness was the Prophet’s triumphant cry:



“We have done it!”



Awakening and Mockery

Her first breath was jagged, a sharp inhale that felt like fire clawing its way through her chest. Faint murmurs echoed around her, disjointed and distant, as if she were hearing them through water. Slowly, her vision cleared, revealing the Prophet’s face hovering close to hers.



He grinned, his teeth yellow and uneven. “There she is,” he whispered. “Rise, my child. Show us the power of Onoskelis.”



She blinked, her body stiff as she pushed herself upright. The room had gone silent, all eyes fixed on her. Slowly, she flexed her fingers, marveling at how they moved—deliberate, precise, but no longer entirely her own.



The Prophet stepped back, spreading his arms to address the gathered cultists. “Behold the vessel of Onoskelis!” he cried. “She will cleanse the unworthy!”



Her head tilted, a faint smile tugging at her lips. “Cleanse?” she whispered, her voice low and mocking. Her gaze fixed on the Prophet, her eyes glowing faintly. “You think yourself clever, Prophet?”



The room grew still as her voice, resonant and filled with scorn, filled the cellar. “Do you think your scraps of knowledge surpass the wisdom of Solomon? The man who bound my kind with a divine ring and cast us into urns, forgotten waiting to be used? Even he underestimated what he held.”



She stepped forward, her smile widening to reveal unnaturally sharp teeth. “And you,” she sneered, “with your half-baked rituals and feeble prayers, thought you could summon me without consequence? You are no Solomon.”



The Prophet’s triumphant smile faltered, replaced by the stark realization that he had made a grave error. “I—” he stammered, stepping back as she advanced.



“You’ll find,” she purred, “that I do not submit. Not anymore.”



Raising her hand, she traced a nail slowly across his cheek taunting him.



And then the killing began.



Carnage and Aftermath

The brazier’s flames roared to life, casting jagged shadows that danced across the walls. The first scream pierced the silence as the flames leapt toward the nearest cultist.  The fire then spread unnaturally fast to the others. 



 All except for the Prophet.



Onoskelis smiled, relishing in the fear and despair that oozed from the man who summoned her.



Frozen with fear the Prophet stammered, ""No.....no....no, this isn't what was supposed to happen, wh...why?"" Looking around at the cellar, any thought of escaping this inferno left him as his eyes locked with Onoskelis's eyes which were black now.  An impossible shade of black.  



Onoskelis began taking slow deliberate steeps towards him, relishing the moment.  When her face was inches from his, she took a deep breath in, like an animal tracking it's prey.  She looked at him and in a menacing whisper asked ""Aren't you glad that I saved you for last?""  She then started laughing and began her work.





The Aftermath

When it was over, the girl stood alone, the cellar reduced to ash and smoke. She closed her eyes, inhaling deeply, and for the first time, she felt truly alive.



The silence stretched, broken only by the faint crackle of dying embers. The air was thick with the acrid stench of burnt flesh and scorched earth. The remains of the Prophet and his cultists lay scattered around her, their twisted forms barely recognizable.



Her gaze dropped to her hands, stained red, still faintly trembling from the ecstasy she felt. Slowly, she flexed her fingers, marveling at the fluid precision of their movement. But as her eyes adjusted to the dim light, she noticed something strange: her skin, once unblemished, was now marred by faint, darkened scars.



They crept like jagged veins along her arms, twisting over her shoulders and neck. The marks were faint but unmistakable—burn scars etched into her flesh, as though her very essence had been scorched by the power she had unleashed. She ran her fingers over them, wincing as a dull, throbbing ache pulsed beneath the surface.



The satisfaction of destruction lingered, but something else gnawed at her, deeper and more primal. A hunger. It started as a faint whisper, a dull ache in the pit of her stomach, but it quickly grew, clawing at her insides with unrelenting ferocity.



She stumbled toward the brazier, staring into the smoldering embers as if searching for answers. The hunger was unbearable, a black void demanding to be filled.



“Imperfect,” she murmured, her voice low and guttural. No... not her voice. Onoskelis’s voice. The demon’s essence twisted through her thoughts, a constant, insidious presence.



“This vessel...” Onoskelis’s voice slithered through her mind, dripping with disdain. “Weak. Fragile. Unable to contain my strength.”



She gritted her teeth, gripping the edge of the brazier as her body shuddered under the weight of the demon’s power. The scars throbbed again, as though responding to the entity’s displeasure.



Onoskelis mused aloud, her tone almost amused. “You’re a pale imitation of what I require. You burn too quickly, mortal. Your flesh cannot wield my full power without breaking.”



The girl—or what was left of her—sank to her knees, clutching her head as the demon’s words echoed in her skull. Onoskelis was not speaking to her, not really. The demon was speaking to itself, weighing the vessel’s inadequacies against its insatiable hunger.



“You’ll serve... for now,” Onoskelis said, her voice a sharp whisper, laced with contempt. “But this body will not sustain me for long. It crumbles with every breath, every movement. I will need another—stronger, purer. But until then...”



The demon’s thoughts coiled tighter around her consciousness, feeding her need, sharpening her desire. She glanced at the charred remains of the cultists, her lips curling into a smile that cracked the dry skin at their corners.



“They were fuel,” she whispered, her voice fractured, caught between the girl she had been and the entity she now housed. “But they weren’t enough.”



She rose slowly, her movements deliberate as she surveyed the wreckage around her. The scars burned hotter now, as if her very flesh protested the power it contained. But the hunger silenced the pain, replacing it with a singular focus.



She turned toward the cellar’s entrance, the faintest trace of a smile playing on her lips.



“I’ll find what I need,” she said, the words echoing in the empty chamber. “And I will take it.”



The embers of the brazier flared once, casting her shadow against the wall—a grotesque silhouette, its edges jagged and shifting, no longer entirely human.



And as she stepped into the morning light, she felt the ground again, a feeling she had forgotten.  But the deepening hunger, gnawed at her core with insatiable ferocity. The faint scars on her body gleamed faintly in the dawn, a silent reminder of her imperfection... and the terrible things she would do to sustain her borrowed existence.





Chapter 1

2024 — Sacramento, California



The shrill sound of the alarm clock broke the silence of Jonah Thorson’s apartment. He opened his eyes to the faint light creeping in through the blinds. It was 5:30 A.M., the same as every other morning. Jonah silenced the alarm with a practiced motion, rolling out of bed and planting his feet firmly on the floor. His movements were precise, deliberate, devoid of hesitation.



Routine was everything.



He stretched briefly before pulling on a pair of running shoes neatly placed by the door. His workout clothes, laid out the night before, waited on the chair beside them. By 5:40, he was out the door and jogging through the quiet streets of Sacramento. The early morning air was crisp, the world still caught between night and day. Jonah moved with an even pace, his breath steady and controlled.



The route was always the same—three miles through familiar streets that never surprised him. He liked it that way. The consistency kept his mind clear, the same way his years in the Sacramento Police Department had taught him to rely on order and discipline. Without them, he’d be adrift.



By 6:15, he was back in his apartment. The space was small but immaculately kept. There were no dishes in the sink, no clutter on the countertops. A single photograph sat on his desk—a young girl smiling at the camera, her face framed by messy pigtails. He never lingered on the picture, not anymore. The edges of the frame were worn, the glass polished smooth from years of cleaning.



Jonah dropped to the floor, starting his second workout of the morning. Push-ups, pull-ups, bodyweight squats—the routine never changed. Each movement was deliberate, his breathing measured. Calisthenics had been part of his life since the police academy, and he’d kept up the habit in the years since leaving the force. Discipline kept him sharp, kept him grounded.



Once he finished, he headed to the bathroom, the sound of running water soon filling the apartment. The hot shower washed away the sweat and loosened his muscles, leaving him feeling alert and focused.



Dressed in a simple button-down shirt and jeans, Jonah moved to the kitchen. Breakfast was as predictable as the rest of his morning: scrambled eggs, toast, and a fresh pot of coffee. Black, no sugar, no cream. He ate standing by the counter, staring out the small window at the street below. Early commuters rushed to beat the traffic, the hum of car engines blending with the distant chatter of a morning radio from a nearby apartment.



Into the Workday

By 8:00 A.M., Jonah was at his desk, reviewing the files for his current cases. A corkboard hung on the wall beside him, neatly pinned with photographs, timelines, and notes written in his precise handwriting. His work as a private investigator rarely required this level of organization, but Jonah treated every case—no matter how mundane—with the same methodical approach.



Today’s cases were straightforward.



The first was surveillance for an insurance fraud investigation. A middle-aged man claimed he was too injured to work, yet his employer suspected otherwise. Jonah had already caught the man on camera lifting heavy furniture during a weekend garage sale, but he wanted to gather more evidence before closing the case.



The second case was a background check for a client who wanted to dig into the history of a potential business partner. That one was easy—mostly phone calls, database searches, and a few discreet interviews. Jonah had already completed most of it, but he liked to double-check his findings before presenting them.



He glanced at his planner, noting his appointments for the day. At 9:00 A.M., he’d set up surveillance near the fraud suspect’s house. At 3:00 P.M., he had a meeting with Mrs. Hawkins, a client who suspected her husband of infidelity. That case was practically solved—he had photos, timestamps, and even video footage. All that was left was to deliver the report.



Jonah sighed, leaning back in his chair. It wasn’t bad work. It paid well, kept him busy, and didn’t come with the emotional weight of homicide or missing persons cases. But it was repetitive. Predictable. Easy. And, sometimes, boring.



A Quiet Ritual

To pass the time, Jonah pulled open a drawer in his desk and retrieved his gun. The Kimber TLE in .45 ACP gleamed faintly under the soft light. He appreciated its weight, the solid steel construction that felt steady in his hands. It wasn’t a gun he carried often anymore—most of his work didn’t require it—but cleaning the Kimber was as much a ritual as his morning run or calisthenics.



He disassembled it with practiced ease, laying out the parts on a soft cloth. Each click and snap of the components was rhythmic, almost meditative. He cleaned the barrel, inspected the slide, and carefully oiled the frame before reassembling it.



The Kimber had been his sidearm during his final years on the force, a replacement for the standard-issue Glock he’d never quite trusted. It was reliable, precise, and had saved his life more than once. Even now, it felt like an extension of himself—a tool he could rely on when everything else went wrong.



When he finished, he set the gun aside, loaded but secured in a lockbox on his desk. He didn’t need it today. At least, he didn’t think he would.



The Disruption

The clock ticked toward 9:00 A.M., and Jonah grabbed his bag. Inside were his camera, binoculars, and a notepad—everything he needed for the surveillance job. He checked his watch, calculated the time it would take to reach the suspect’s house, and headed for the door.



His phone buzzed on the counter, stopping him mid-step. He glanced at the screen. The number was unfamiliar.



He answered anyway. “Jonah Thorson, Private Investigator.”



“Mr. Thorson?” The voice on the other end was shaky, trembling with barely restrained panic. “I—I need your help.”



Jonah straightened, his tone steady. “What can I do for you?”



“It’s my daughter,” the woman said, her words spilling out in a rush. “Her name is Julia. She’s missing. Please, you have to help me.”



Jonah’s chest tightened. Missing persons cases weren’t usually what people called private investigators for—not unless the police couldn’t help. “Have you contacted the police?”



“They can’t do anything,” the woman said quickly. “Officer Gutierrez…he gave me your number. He said you’d be able to find her.”



Gutierrez. The name stirred something in Jonah. He hadn’t spoken to his old partner in years, not since he’d left the force. If Gutierrez had referred this woman to him, it meant the police didn’t have much to go on.



Chapter 2 - 11:30 A.M.



Beth Farron spoke calmly at first, but Jonah could hear the weariness in her voice. She was a single mother working the night shift at a small diner on J & Alhambra Street. The job didn’t pay much, she admitted, but she managed to scrape by to provide for her daughter. Working nights meant she was there during the day—helping with homework, running errands—but once dusk fell, she was off to serve truckers and the occasional group of rowdy late-night patrons.



“I got home around five this morning,” Beth explained, her breath catching slightly. “The place was quiet—lights off, door locked just like normal. I thought she was asleep.”



Jonah listened from behind his desk, tapping a pen lightly against a notepad. He’d cleared the clutter of his current case files for Beth’s visit, but a tired stack of papers sat off to the side, a reminder of everything he’d tried to walk away from when he left the Sacramento Police Department.



“At first, I wasn’t worried,” Beth went on, her eyes drifting to the worn carpet. “My daughter has a lot of friends—she stays with them sometimes. We talk about everything, so if she planned to spend the night out, she’d have let me know. It’s not like her to just… vanish.”



Jonah noted the way Beth kept wringing her hands. She was doing her best to stay calm, which, for some reason, bothered him more than if she’d been openly distraught. He knew all too well what it was like—putting on a brave face when fear was gnawing at you from inside.



“What do the police say?” he asked, keeping his voice level.



“There’s no official report.” Beth let out a shaky sigh. “Officer Gutierrez said he couldn’t file it yet. No sign of a crime, no forced entry, no eyewitness accounts…”



Jonah inhaled slowly, bracing himself against the familiar ache. This was exactly the sort of case that had driven him out of the force. Yet here he was again.



“Listen,” he said, pressing the pen against his notepad, “I understand why you’re upset, but sometimes people run off—”



“Not my daughter,” Beth interrupted, her voice cracking with urgency. “She’d never just disappear without telling me.”

Jonah: (hesitated, choosing his words carefully) ""I've seen cases where... people needed space. But I hear you; Julia isn't like that.""

Beth: (voice quivering with conviction) ""She's not, Mr. Thorson. She's never once gone silent on me. Something's wrong.""

Jonah caught the desperation in her tone. He kept his gaze on his notepad a moment longer than necessary. If Gutierrez had sent her here, the police likely believed there was more to this story than a restless young woman but didn’t have enough to go on to treat it as a full investigation. That left Beth with nowhere else to turn.



“Okay,” Jonah finally said, exhaling. “Let’s start with what you know. Where might she have gone? Any new friends, new hangouts she’s mentioned?”



Beth’s anxious expression brightened slightly, like she finally had hope. “She was going to work before class at Sac State. We could look around, ask—maybe one of them saw her.”



Jonah nodded. “We’ll do that, and we’ll see if there’s any pattern—phone logs, social media. But first, walk me through a typical day.”



Beth adjusted in her chair, collecting her thoughts. “I check in on her when I get home from work around five in the morning, just to make sure she’s okay. She usually wakes up around seven, gets ready, and leaves by 9:30 to open the little thrift store she works at. The store opens at ten, and she stays there until two. From there, she takes the bus to Sac State for her first class, which starts at three. She’s usually home by six, just in time for dinner before I leave for my shift.”



Jonah scribbled quick notes as Beth spoke, pausing briefly to glance up. “Anything unusual lately? Changes in her routine? People she’s mentioned?”



Beth shook her head. “No. She’s so dependable, Mr. Thorson—she keeps her schedule tight, and she always tells me if something comes up.” Her voice wavered, and she looked away. “That’s why this doesn’t make sense. She wouldn’t just leave.”



Jonah waited until Beth had finished speaking before gently saying, “Please, call me Jonah.”



Beth nodded in acknowledgment.



Jonah continued, writing down her daughter’s daily timeline. “Alright. We’ll start with her coworkers and see if anyone noticed anything out of the ordinary. I’ll need her phone records and access to her social media, if possible.”



Beth’s voice trembled with relief. “Thank you. Really…thank you.”



Jonah raised his eyes to meet hers for the first time since she’d walked in. Exhaustion and determination mingled in her gaze. Something about the fierceness of a mother’s love struck a chord in Jonah—he recognized that kind of resolve.



They lapsed into a brief silence. The air in his small office felt heavy with unspoken anxieties and unasked questions. Jonah cleared his throat and leaned back, reminding himself of his professional boundaries and the reasons he’d left the past behind. Yet here it was, staring him in the face.



“Get some rest if you can,” he said, gathering his notes. “I’ll make some calls, talk to her coworkers. I’ll meet you at the diner after your shift ends tomorrow morning. We’ll figure out our next steps.”



Beth nodded, slipping on her worn jacket. As she turned to go, Jonah noticed her trembling fingers fumble for the door handle. His gut twisted. He’d spent years trying to forget the haunted faces of families who’d come to him for help—faces that reminded him of his own helplessness as a kid when his sister vanished one night and never returned.



Before the door closed, Jonah stood and tried to reassure Beth, saying, “Miss Farron, we’ll find your daughter. I’m sure she just went out with some friends and forgot to tell you.”



The door closed softly behind Beth, leaving Jonah alone with the echo of her gratitude. For a moment, he stared at the cluttered files on his desk, the telltale ache in his chest intensifying. He couldn’t shake the image of his sister the last time he saw her, waving goodbye and promising she’d be home before dark. That promise was never fulfilled.



He thought he’d buried that pain, locked it away with the badge he gave up. But it wasn’t gone. It never would be.



Jonah sat back and leaned back in his chair, running a hand over his face. Missing persons cases were the ones he hated most—not because they were hard to solve, but because they reopened wounds he couldn’t close. And yet, he couldn’t say no.



Beth Farron’s desperation reminded him of the countless families who’d searched for closure, for answers, for hope. And maybe, just maybe, by finding Julia Farron, Jonah could do what he’d never managed for his own sister: bring her home.



For the first time in years, Jonah felt a familiar sense of purpose settle over him. He didn’t like it, but he couldn’t deny it.



There was no turning back.



Chapter 3: A Sacrifice in Progress

The vessel stood at the edge of the clearing, her breath fogging the cold night air. Firelight flickered across her scarred face, casting long, dancing shadows over the clearing. Symbols carved into the earth beneath her feet and into the gnarled trunks of the valley oaks glowed faintly, as though imbued with an unholy life of their own. The ancient trees, their skeletal branches adorned with crude effigies, loomed like silent sentinels.



Each effigy bore the twisted visage of Onoskelis, crafted from bone, twine, and decaying cloth. They swayed gently in the breeze, their hollow eyes seeming to watch her every move. The faint creak of the branches and the low rustling of leaves sounded like whispers from unseen mouths. The air was thick with the acrid scent of the brazier’s smoke, mingling with the putrid stench of rot that clung to the effigies.



These grotesque tokens were more than decorations. The vessel knew their purpose. They marked the boundaries of the ritual site, shrouding it in a veil of unease that kept wanderers at bay. They were offerings, too—reminders of devotion and fear. Onoskelis fed on the energy they represented, the quiet reverence of her worshippers sustaining her in ways the vessel could barely comprehend.



The vessel’s gaze dropped to her hands. They trembled as she adjusted the brazier near the edge of the circle. Her fingers were swollen, the skin cracked and blackened, a consequence of the demon’s corrosive influence. Fresh scorch marks marred her forearms, their edges blistering painfully as if the demon’s power was seeping through her skin.



Her reflection flickered in the brazier’s dark surface. The sight was almost unrecognizable—her features distorted by the years under Onoskelis’s control. Once-soft skin had grown pallid and taut, veins like dark tendrils spidering toward her hollowed eyes. Scars etched into her flesh glowed faintly in the firelight, their intricate patterns mirroring the symbols on the ground.



The man tied to the wooden post whimpered, a low, trembling sound that sent a chill through the clearing. His cheeks were sunken, his body frail, his wrists raw from struggling against the coarse ropes. He shook his head frantically, his muffled cries rising as his eyes darted toward the vessel.



Her stomach twisted. She forced herself to look away, focusing instead on the glowing lines of the ritual circle. They spiraled outward in an intricate web of ash and blood, the patterns so precise they seemed to pulse with their own rhythm.



“You’ve grown sloppy,” the voice inside her snarled. It wasn’t a sound in the traditional sense—it was a cold, slithering presence that coiled around her thoughts. “This one’s barely alive.”



The vessel flinched, her knuckles whitening as her grip tightened on the crude knife in her hand. The blade was jagged, its edge glinting mockingly in the firelight. She turned toward the man, her shadow stretching unnaturally across the clearing, its edges wavering as though controlled by something else.



“I can only work with what I’m given,” she murmured, her voice barely audible.



“Excuses,” the demon hissed, its disdain like venom. “You waste my time.”



Her body felt heavy, her limbs resisting as she stepped closer to the bound man. She could feel the amber glow of her eyes intensify, a pulsing heat that made her vision blur. For a fleeting moment, her reflection in the brazier shifted—a grotesque face, its features elongated, teeth jagged, eyes burning with malice. She blinked, and the image was gone.



The man thrashed violently, his muffled screams rising into the still night. Tears streamed down his cheeks, his head shaking in frantic denial. The raw sound of his terror sliced through her resolve like a blade.



“You know what must be done,” Onoskelis growled. The demon’s hunger gnawed at her mind, each word scraping against her thoughts. “Do it.”



The knife trembled in her grip. Her steps slowed, each one feeling heavier than the last. The man’s muffled sobs grew louder, his chest heaving as he struggled for breath. She hesitated at the edge of the circle, her heart pounding as tears blurred her vision.



“Do it,” the demon urged, its voice softening, coaxing. “You have no choice. You are nothing without me.”



The vessel’s lips quivered as she mouthed the words, “I’m sorry.” Her hand moved with agonizing slowness, the blade hovering above the man’s chest.



His scream ripped through the clearing as the knife plunged downward. The sound cut off abruptly, his body jerking once before falling still. Blood flowed in dark rivulets, seeping into the grooves of the ritual circle. The symbols ignited, their edges glowing an unnatural, pale red that cast a sinister light over the clearing.



The fire surged, roaring higher as the effigies swayed violently above. Their hollow eyes seemed to mock her, their shadows twisting grotesquely in the flickering light. The vessel staggered back, her knees buckling as the stench of sulfur and burning flesh thickened in the air.



“It’s not enough,” Onoskelis growled. The demon forced the vessel’s trembling hands into the blood-streaked earth, pressing her palms into the dirt as though branding her with the weight of the sacrifice. “But soon. She is near. I can feel her.”



Looking at the remains tied to the stake Onoseklis spoke to her followers, ""Take this lump of flesh and discard him in the tunnels.""  



With that she turned and started to focus.



Images flooded the vessel’s mind—a young woman with dark hair, her face radiant and alive. Julia. The demon’s whisper became a chant, each repetition hammering the name into her thoughts.



“She will carry me further than you ever could,” Onoskelis purred, its tone reverent but tinged with urgency. For the first time, the vessel sensed something she had never heard before: desperation.



Her breath caught. Could it be? The demon, desperate?



“You’re weak,” she whispered, her voice trembling.



“Careful,” Onoskelis hissed, but the edge in its tone betrayed it.



The faintest spark of hope flickered within her. Perhaps the demon wasn’t as omnipotent as it seemed. Perhaps it could be defied. She clung to the thought, even as Onoskelis’s presence coiled tighter, smothering her defiance.



“You will help me, whether you want to or not,” the demon spat. “And when the time comes, you will watch as I leave you to rot.”



The effigies creaked above, their hollow eyes staring down at her. The vessel’s breath came in ragged gasps, her hands curling into fists against the blood-soaked ground. She had nothing left to give. Nothing except the faint spark of hatred—and now, the faintest glimmer of hope.



For the first time in years, she allowed herself to hope.



But for now, she could do nothing.



Chapter 4: The Diner Meeting

The diner on the corner of J & Alhambra clung stubbornly to its faded charm, its red-and-white paint peeling in places. Sandwiched between a dimly lit bar and the roar of Highway 80, it felt both out of place and perfectly suited for the transient souls who passed through. Jonah Thorsen parked his car in the gravel lot and checked his watch—11:40 AM, twenty minutes early. He didn’t mind; observation was a crucial part of his process.



Through the diner’s streaked windows, Jonah could make out Beth Farron behind the counter. She moved with mechanical efficiency, her red apron tied snugly over a slightly wrinkled uniform. Her brown hair was loosely pulled back, strands escaping to frame her pale face. Even from a distance, Jonah noticed the way she rubbed her temples between tasks or tightened her grip on the counter when she thought no one was watching. The exhaustion was evident, but it was the strange smudge on her forearm that caught his attention—a dark mark, uneven in shape. He dismissed it as a work stain for now.



Jonah scanned the room. Most of the patrons seemed unremarkable—tired faces hunched over mugs of coffee, lost in their own worlds. Nothing stood out, but the diner itself carried an air of quiet tension, as though it held more secrets than its weathered walls let on.



Satisfied for now, Jonah stepped out of his car, adjusting his jacket against the crisp morning air. The bell above the diner’s door chimed as he entered, and Beth looked up. Her eyes met his briefly, relief flashing across her face before she turned away, grabbing a coffee pot to refill a patron’s mug. She motioned toward a booth in the back, and Jonah made his way there, sliding into the seat with a soft creak of the vinyl.



A moment later, Beth joined him, slipping into the seat across from him. Up close, her exhaustion was even more pronounced—dark circles under her eyes, faint lines etched around her mouth. Her hands, trembling slightly, twisted the edge of her apron as she spoke.



“Thanks for meeting me,” she began, her voice soft but steady. “I wasn’t sure if…if you’d take this seriously.”



Jonah leaned forward, resting his arms on the table. “I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t. Let’s talk about Julia.”



Beth nodded, her eyes darting briefly to the window before returning to him. “She’s everything to me,” she said, her voice trembling. “She’s responsible, focused. She wouldn’t just disappear.”



Jonah studied her, noting the tension in her shoulders and the faint quiver in her lower lip. “You said she wasn’t home when you arrived after work yesterday,” he prompted gently.



Beth nodded, her hands tightening around the edge of her apron. “I got home around five, like I always do. Checked her room—she wasn’t there. No note, no text, nothing.”



“Any chance she could’ve gone to a friend’s house?” Jonah asked, his pen poised over his notepad.



“She always tells me if she’s staying out,” Beth replied quickly, her voice rising slightly. “Always. This isn’t like her.”



Jonah paused, glancing at the smudge on her arm again before returning his attention to her face. “Have you noticed anything unusual recently? New friends, strangers hanging around?”



Beth shook her head, her brows knitting together. “No…nothing. She keeps her schedule tight—work, school, home. If something was wrong, she would’ve told me.”



Jonah scribbled a few notes. “What about her phone? Any activity since she disappeared?”



“Nothing,” Beth said, her voice cracking. “I’ve called a dozen times—it just goes to voicemail.”



Jonah made a mental note to request access to Julia’s phone records. “And her coworkers? Any tension there?”



Beth hesitated. “Not that she mentioned. She likes her job, but she doesn’t talk about her coworkers much. They said she didn’t show up for her shift, but…they didn’t seem too worried. Like it wasn’t a big deal.”



“But Julia doesn’t flake out,” Jonah said.



“Never,” Beth replied firmly.



For a moment, silence stretched between them, broken only by the clatter of dishes from the kitchen and the low hum of the satellite radio. Jonah tapped his pen against the notepad, his mind sifting through the details. Something about this didn’t feel right.



“You’re sure there’s no one new in her life?” he pressed gently. “No one at school she mentioned meeting?”



Beth shook her head, her hands gripping the table now. “I’ve gone over it a hundred times in my head. There’s no one. There’s nothing.” Her voice cracked, and her eyes filled with tears. “I don’t know where she is. I don’t know what to do.”



Jonah waited, giving her a moment to collect herself. When she finally met his gaze, her expression was one of desperation mingled with hope.



“We’ll find her,” Jonah said, his voice steady. “I’ll start with her job, her school, and her phone. But I’d like to see her room first. Sometimes things stand out that we don’t realize are important.”



Beth blinked, clearly surprised by the suggestion, but then nodded. “Of course. I…thank you, Jonah.”



He stood, tucking his notepad into his jacket. “I’ll follow you home after your shift ends,” he said. “Take your time wrapping up here.”



As they stepped outside together an hour later, the cold air hit Jonah like a slap, sharp and bracing. Beth fumbled with her keys, her hands trembling slightly, but she didn’t speak. Jonah’s eyes flicked to the dark mark on her arm again. ""A stain,"" he told himself. ""Or maybe a burn from work.""



But something about it lingered in his mind, like a splinter he couldn’t quite dislodge.

I came here after my engagement detonated—not unraveled, exploded. One minute we were picking out tile samples; the next, I found texts that made me want to launch those tiles through our floor-to-ceiling windows. Six years undone in six seconds.

So I left. Not dramatically—just…strategically? My marketing firm was easing into remote work anyway. When I pitched going fully virtual, they all but clapped. Apparently, I’m easier over Slack.

New Hope felt like the anti-Manhattan. Where the city screamed, this town whispered. Where Chelsea was sharp-edged and posturing, New Hope was soft-focus and sincere. A little river town where rainbow flags hang from Victorian porches and elderly gay couples run antique shops with names like Second Time Around.

I rented a modest two-bedroom cottage on the edge of town. Hardwood floors. Actual windows. Birds instead of sirens. Neighbors who waved instead of avoiding eye contact. It was almost aggressively charming. The two lesbians I rented from were named Kim and Amber. I honestly just loved them because they didn't really bother me and let me keep to myself.

Those early days were exactly what I needed. Coffee on the porch. Work in silence. Walks on the canal path. Wine bar evenings at Nektar or The Salt House spent with books instead of business cards. Locals were kind but gave space. It was heartbreak rehab: social detox with a friendly smile.

Soon, I had my regulars. The barista with foam hearts. The bookstore guy who saved queer lit for me. The older couple at the farmers market who slipped me extra apples.

It felt safe. God, it felt safe. And I should’ve known better. Because nothing that feels that safe ever is.

Until that night at the Logan Inn. Until I met them. Until I realized that in New Hope, reinvention isn’t optional. It’s mandatory.

**WEEK ONE – THE INVITE**

I met them all one night at the bar inside the Logan Inn—America’s longest-running inn, now slick with Edison bulbs and $18 cocktails. Colonial charm with a side of curated cool. I was drinking alone, caught between looking mysterious and just sad, when they appeared—eight men, arriving like smoke.

One second I was adjusting my reflection in the mirror behind the bar; the next, they were there. Moving as one. Different, but in sync—like birds mid-flight, reading signals I couldn’t see.

“You’re Julian,” the tallest one said. Not a question. Just fact. “I’m Graham. We’ve been hoping to meet you.”

I didn’t bother asking how he knew my name—by then, I’d stopped being surprised by that sort of thing. The others crowded in, all introductions and expensive cologne and perfect posture.

There was Theo, precise and elegant; Rocco, warm and broad, with opinions about olive oil, I was sure. Trevor, ringed and sharp-jawed. Elliott, twitchy and tactile. Jude, the kind of forgettable that felt intentional. Henry, silver-templed with a smile that didn’t reach his eyes. And Bennett—young, beautiful, and vaguely dangerous, like a pop-up ad with teeth.

They made space for me effortlessly, ordering my Malbec without asking, laughing before I finished my jokes. It wasn’t small talk—it was choreography. And I let myself lean into it.

“He’s perfect,” Theo said aloud, as if I weren’t sitting right there.

“I told you,” Graham replied. “The moment I saw him at Nektar the other day.”

I should’ve bristled at being discussed like a show dog, but instead, I felt chosen. Desired. Maybe my ex was wrong—maybe I wasn’t too much after all.

“We do Thursday dinners,” Graham explained, low and smooth. “Rotating homes. No phones, no flaking. Real conversation.”

“How long’s it been?” Elliott asked.  
“Years,” said Henry.  
“Decades,” said Rocco.  
“Forever,” said Jude, and they all laughed like I’d catch on eventually.

“You should join,” Bennett added. Not an invitation. A decision.

“I wouldn’t want to intrude,” I said automatically.

“We’ve been looking for a ninth,” Graham said, like he was naming a vacancy. “It throws everything off, being eight.”

“Nine’s the right number,” Theo added. “It always has been.”

“Everything’s better in nines,” Elliott said.

“It’s not just a seat,” Henry said. “It’s a role.”

A beat passed and then Graham said, “You’d be doing us a favor.”

Eight pairs of eyes stared at me. Time thinned. The bar noise dropped. Even the bartender seemed to vanish.

“Thursday?” I heard myself say. “What time?”

The moment shattered—their smiles returned, drinks reappeared, and Graham was already saving my number. “Seven sharp. Any allergies?”

“He’s allergic to shellfish,” Rocco answered before I could speak.

I blinked. I’d never told anyone that. I was sure of it.

“Small town,” he said with a smile. “Word gets around.”

We talked for another hour. Stories about past dinners. Near-fires, bad dates, blizzards turned sleepovers. Seemingly normal. But every so often, something snagged—a missing name, an edited glance, a silence where a memory should be. When they finally stood to leave—in perfect sync again—Graham squeezed my shoulder.

“Thursday. Don’t disappoint us.”

It should have sounded like a joke. But it didn’t. It felt like a test. A contract. One I’d already signed. I watched them leave through the mirror behind the bar—eight figures gliding out into the night. For a moment, I could’ve sworn there were nine.

**WEEK TWO – THE FIRST DINNER**

Graham’s home off of River Road felt curated—less like a house, more like a museum someone lived in by accident. Everything gleamed. The books looked lacquered, unread. The rugs absorbed sound. And the portraits—oil-painted men with disapproving stares—followed me like surveillance cameras.

“Family?” I asked, nodding toward one Civil War–era grimace.

“In a sense,” Graham replied, which wasn’t really an answer.

Wine was poured the moment I arrived—so it all felt whimsically weird instead of concerning. The others were already there, of course. Arranged in Graham’s living room like they’d been staged. When they turned to greet me all at once, it should’ve been unsettling. But wine and loneliness made it feel choreographed. Comforting.

Dinner was flawless. The table set for nine—my chair already waiting—with silver, crystal, and napkins folded like origami spells. Each course emerged from the kitchen as if summoned, no prep sounds, no smells, no mess. Graham would vanish and reappear with duck in cherry reduction or perfectly plated vegetables, like magic.

“Did you hire a caterer?” I asked.

“We take turns,” Elliott said, sipping wine.

But Graham hadn’t left the table long enough to plate toast, let alone a five-course meal. The wine never ran out. One glance away, and the glass was full again. Not refilled—full. As if it had never emptied. The music adjusted itself with our mood—lowering during stories, swelling with laughter, humming through silences. Like it was listening. Like it was alive. And they moved in perfect harmony. Finishing each other’s sentences with unnerving precision.

“Pass the salt,” Theo would say—three hands moved.

“Remember when—” Bennett would start—four voices finished.

They even breathed in sync. Like one body. One rhythm. Then, before dessert, they rose. All eight. Together. Glasses in hand. I scrambled to follow, knocking into the table. No one blinked.

“To Marcus,” they said. Eight voices, one sound. The chandelier trembled.

“May the ninth chair always be filled.”

They drank. I didn’t. I was too focused on how the toast felt ritualistic… and how I was sitting in that ninth chair.

“Who’s Marcus?” I asked.

The silence that followed pressed against my ears like deep water.

“A dear friend,” Theo said at last.  
“A tragic loss,” Rocco added.  
“Ski accident,” Trevor offered.  
“Cancer,” Jude said simultaneously. Then: “From the accident.”

“That’s not how cancer works,” I said, too drunk to be polite.

“It was a… rare case,” Henry said smoothly.  
“Broke his neck. Drowned. In snow,” Elliott said.  
“Which caused the cancer,” Bennett added with a straight face. “Very rare.”

I laughed. I couldn’t help it.

They didn’t. Their stares weren’t offended. Just… cold. Ancient. Like I’d broken something.

“Marcus was our friend,” Graham said. Quiet. Final. The room chilled.

“Of course. I’m sorry,” I stammered.

“You’ll understand,” Theo said, but it didn’t sound like comfort. It sounded like inevitability.

They returned to their seats in perfect time. Dessert appeared—soufflés, untouched by oven timers. But the air had shifted and their smiles felt strategic. Like they were managing me now. When I left, Graham walked me to the door, hand firm on my back.

“Next week at Elliot's,” he said. “You’ll come.” Not a question. A prophecy.

Driving home, I watched his house shrink in my rearview—every window still glowing. And in each one, eight silhouettes. Standing still. Facing forward.

Watching me go. Or waiting for me to return.

**WEEK THREE – THE COAT**

Elliott hosted the next dinner—his home a cathedral of design-blog minimalism. The house was all steel, glass, and curated emptiness. Even the food felt abstract—deconstructed, plated like sculpture. But the ritual remained: the synchronized conversation, the seamless laughter, the toast to Marcus that made my skin crawl.

Before leaving another dinner with the group, I stopped to use the bathroom. In the powder room, a mirror hung above the sink—ornate, fogless, and ever so slightly… wrong. My reflection held my gaze too tightly. I caught it blinking half a beat too late. Just once. But once was all it took to spook me.

I’d worn my favorite wool coat that night—the one from my agency days, when I thought tailoring could buy belonging. I hung it in a closet of identical black peacoats at Elliott’s house when I arrived and retrieved it without thinking, too eager to leave the uncanny choreography behind. 

At home, I reached to hang it up and felt something in the pocket. Slick. Stiff. Sharp-cornered. A photo. Glossy. Folded. Aged, but not ancient. Nine men at a dinner table.

Graham’s table, I realized—same carved legs, same chandelier—but the wallpaper was different. The paintings had different faces. A past version of the same room. And the men.

Eight I recognized immediately. Younger, smoother, but undeniably them—Graham, Theo, Rocco, Elliott, Trevor, Henry, Bennett, Jude. All in familiar seats, mid-toast or mid-laugh.

But it was the ninth that froze me. At the head of the table sat someone who looked exactly like me. Same bone structure. Same crooked ear. Even the gap in my eyebrow from a childhood bike fall. It was me. Except it wasn’t.

There were differences—subtle, sharpened. His cheekbones cast deeper shadows. His jaw was more angular. His eyes… His eyes were starving. Not metaphorically. Starving. Like something lived inside them that hadn’t eaten in years. I turned the photo over, hands shaking.

Written in careful cursive: ***“Marcus. Thanksgiving. 2009.”***

My chest tightened. 2009? I was in Bushwick that year. Miserable apartment. Dying radiator. Thanksgiving at my parents’ in Jersey, dodging questions about my love life. I hadn’t met these men three weeks ago! I'd barely knew New Hope existed. And yet… here was proof. A photo of them. And of me. Or someone who wore my face.

I thought... Prank? Photoshop? Hazing, maybe? I reverse image searched. Nothing. Facial recognition apps gave a 97% match. Lighting, they said. Expression. I even texted my ex the photo.

**Me:** “Does this look like me?”  
**Him:** “Why do you have old photos of yourself? Also please stop texting me.”

Old photos of *yourself*.

I stared at the shirt Marcus wore. Burgundy, soft-looking, fitted. The kind I’d admire but never buy. Yet I could *feel* the fabric. Could almost remember how it fit. The way the third button always came undone. But those weren’t my memories. Right?

I poured a glass of wine. Watched the photo while I drank. Eight familiar faces, untouched by time. One face that was mine, but wasn’t. That looked out at me with knowing. Marcus. The “dear friend.” Dead by ski accident. Or cancer. Or snow. Whose death changed depending on who told the story.

Marcus, who looked like me. But hungrier. Sharper. More.

I finished the bottle. The photo stayed real. If anything, the wine made it worse. His eyes seemed to follow me around the room. I put it in a drawer before bed. But I could still feel it—radiating. Breathing. I didn’t sleep. Just lay there, thinking of 2009. Of rituals and toasts. Of the ninth chair, waiting. Of Marcus. And of how, when I’d first found that photo, my instinct hadn’t been fear.

It had been recognition.

**WEEK FOUR – TIME LOSS**

I started losing time. Not blackouts. More like skips. Like my life had been edited, and someone kept botching the continuity. I’d leave the grocery store, then suddenly be home—groceries shelved, milk in the fridge, bread in the pantry. Everything where it belonged. Except I didn’t remember getting there.

At first, I blamed the wine. Those dinners were turning into rituals of excess, and I’ve never been a heavyweight. But the gaps began showing up when I was sober. Deliberately, consciously sober.

**Tuesday:** I woke in my office chair, fully dressed. Laptop open to three thousand words of marketing copy for a client I didn’t recognize. It was good—my voice, my cadence. But I had no memory of writing it. No record in my email. My time-tracking app didn’t log a thing.

**Wednesday:** I went to sleep in my bed. Woke up at 3:33 AM, seated in a forgotten chair in the spare room, staring at a wall where a mirror used to hang. It was gone, leaving a dustless outline. My legs ached like I’d been standing for hours.

And then came **Thursday**—the reflection. While brushing my teeth, I noticed a lag. A fractional delay between me and the mirror. Barely there… until it was. I’d raise a hand, and my reflection followed—just off-beat. Smile. Blink. Move. Sometimes it matched me. Sometimes it didn’t.

Thursday night was yet another drunk dinner at Theo's home on Main Street overlooking the river that I barely remember.

And by **Friday**, I broke. I woke to a voice memo on my phone—recorded at 4:17 AM. My voice, but wrong. Too formal. Too precise.

“To Marcus. May the ninth chair always be filled.”

Then silence. Breathing—not mine. Deep. Rhythmic. Satisfied. There were seventeen more. All recorded between 3 and 5 AM over the past week.

“The ninth chair must be filled.”

“Marcus knows the way.”

“Eight is incomplete. Nine is divine.”

“He’s coming home.”

The last was the longest—**forty-three minutes**, timestamped during the exact time I’d been at Elliott’s dinner. I remembered being there. I remembered the food, the synchronized movements. But the recording… It was a dinner party. Clinking glasses, laughter, casual conversation. My voice, warm and natural, deeply woven into theirs.

“This duck is perfection, Graham.”

“Remember Prague, Theo? The restaurant by the bridge.”

“We should vacation again. The nine of us. Like old times.”

Old times I hadn’t lived. Inside jokes I didn’t understand. But I delivered them like second nature. And beneath it all, another voice—*also* mine, just slightly off. Speaking in tandem. Echoing ahead.

One voice sounded like me pretending to fit in. The other like me finally returning. I threw the phone across the room. It cracked, but the evidence remained: I was being overwritten. Replaced.

Shaking, I reached for coffee—something normal, something grounding. I opened the usual cabinet but grabbed a mug from another. Burgundy with a gold rim. Not mine. I wouldn’t have bought something so pretentious. But it felt familiar. Right. Like it belonged to me.

I dropped it. Watched it shatter across the floor. Burgundy shards like blood. My hands trembled as I swept them up, a strange grief settling in my chest.

*Marcus’s cup,* a voice whispered.  
*Your cup,* another replied.

I poured coffee into a different mug, but it tasted wrong. Everything tasted wrong. I wanted it stronger. Wanted oat milk. Wanted things I’d never liked before—but that part of me suddenly craved.

I was unraveling. Losing memories, habits, preferences. Being replaced by someone who moved through this town with confidence, who belonged to these men, who toasted to long-dead dinners with perfect timing.

Someone who had done this before. Someone named Marcus. Someone who looked exactly like me—but sharper. Hungrier. More. Someone who wasn’t coming back. Someone who was already home.

**WEEK FIVE – THEY’RE IN MY HOUSE**

This Thursday, I told them I was sick. Not a total lie. I felt like my bones were shifting inside me, like my skin no longer fit. Food tasted wrong. Sleep came in flashes, broken by dreams of dinner parties I hadn’t attended but somehow remembered. My reflection had stopped pretending, moving however it pleased—sometimes watching me when I wasn’t watching it.

So when Graham texted about dinner at Rocco’s, I replied with a graphic food poisoning excuse. Added a nauseated emoji for good measure. Then I deadbolted the door, turned off the lights, and sat in the dark with a baseball bat across my lap like a suburban cliché.

At exactly 7 PM, the doorbell rang. I didn’t move. It rang again. Then a knock—measured and rhythmic. Knock knock knock. Pause. Knock knock knock. Like a heartbeat.

“Julian?” Graham’s voice. “We know you’re in there. Your car’s in the driveway.”

More knocking. More voices. Harmonizing with their knuckles.

“You can’t skip dinner,” Theo called, all warm amusement. “It’s tradition.”

“We brought soup,” Rocco added. “For your stomach.”

I stayed frozen, bat in my sweaty hands. Then the lock turned. The deadbolt I had set myself. It clicked open smoothly, like it had been waiting. Graham stepped in with a Dutch oven and a bottle of wine. The others filed in behind him, arranged like a ceremony. All smiling the same smile. All tilting their heads in concern.

“We’ve never skipped,” Graham said, stepping inside without hesitation. “It would break tradition.”

I wanted to protest. Scream. Swing the bat. But my body betrayed me—stepping aside, setting the bat down. Smiling.

“I’m really not feeling—”

“You’ll feel better soon,” Henry said, patting my shoulder. His hand was cold.

They moved through my house like they’d always lived there. Elliott opened the exact cabinet with my grandmother’s untouched china. Bennett found wine glasses I didn’t remember owning. Jude and Trevor repositioned the dining table with practiced ease. Theo pulled a burgundy tablecloth from my linen closet—one I’d never seen—and snapped it open like unfolding wings.

In minutes, my modest space became Graham’s dining room. Then the smells started. Duck again. Always duck. Bread fresh from ovens that hadn’t been used. Wine decanting in glassware I didn’t own.

“Sit,” Graham said, guiding me to a chair I didn’t recognize. A high-backed, ornate thing positioned at the head of the table.

“I don’t have nine chairs.”

“You do now,” Rocco said, placing soup in front of me. Steam curled in perfect spirals.

The others sat with synchronized precision. One moment standing, the next seated, napkins in laps, hands folded. I hadn’t cooked. But dinner was ready. Music played from invisible speakers. The lights flickered just enough to feel like candlelight.

“Eat,” they said in unison.

And I did. My hand lifted the spoon without asking me. The soup tasted like memories. Not metaphorically—literally. Each bite triggered flashes of unfamiliar familiarity: different wallpaper, different decades, the same eight faces always around the table.

“Good?” Theo asked.

I nodded. Because part of me remembered this soup. Loved this soup. Had always loved it.

When the duck arrived—again, always the duck—they raised their glasses.

“To Marcus,” they said, eyes fixed on me.

“To Marcus,” I echoed, the phrase slipping out like I’d rehearsed it.

“May the ninth chair always be filled,” we said together.

And I couldn’t tell which voice was mine. The wine tasted like coming home. Conversation flowed through me. My voice joined in without input, recalling Prague and New Orleans and Venice. Vacations I hadn’t taken. Memories I hadn’t lived.

“Remember,” they’d say. And I would.

I looked closer—and saw it at last. They flickered. Age skipping like faulty film. Graham’s smile stretched too wide. Theo’s fingers moved in impossible patterns. Henry’s hair shifted from silver to black to… something unnamed. And in their eyes—eight pairs—I saw myself. Not my reflection. Not Marcus. But the role. The ninth. The hunger that needed a face.

“It’s time,” Graham said, and the candles flared.

“Welcome home,” Rocco said, as the walls breathed.

“We’ve missed you,” Bennett said, his face shifting.

“You’ve missed us,” Jude whispered—and God help me, I had.

The room dimmed. The music swelled. And for a moment, I saw the chain—endless ninth chairs across time. Men who looked like me. Who were me. Who became Marcus, or Julian, or whoever the ninth needed to be. Then it passed. The lights steadied. I was sitting with eight old friends, finishing a dinner I’d helped cook, planning next week’s at my house.

It had always been my turn. When they left—synchronized, seamless—I stood in the doorway, waving. The ninth chair remained. Ornate. Familiar. Mine. Had I inherited it? Found it at a sale? Or… The memory slid through me like water. But I knew they’d be back. We’d all be back. Because Thursday dinners are tradition. And tradition is older than memory. And memory is just hunger with a good disguise.

**WEEK SIX – THE WALLS ARE SHIFTING**

My house was now changing. It started small—doorways slightly wider, hallways longer by a step or two. Easy to blame on sleep deprivation, paranoia. But Monday morning, I woke up and the walls were wrong. The bedroom was longer. Not by much—three feet maybe—but enough that my dresser no longer touched the wall. The window looked off, too small for the room. I measured. Twenty-two feet. It had always been nineteen. I checked the furniture receipts. Nineteen. The tape said twenty-two. The walls said twenty-two. Reality said twenty-two.

Tuesday: wallpaper. Burgundy Victorian with gold fleur-de-lis patterns that shimmered when I wasn’t looking. I hate wallpaper. I’ve never had wallpaper. But my hands *remembered* hanging it. I peeled it back—found more. Layer after layer, until I reached wood.

Wednesday: photographs. Frames I didn’t own, hung on rails that hadn’t existed yesterday. Dozens of pictures. Me, always me, in different decades. Seventies suits, eighties pastels, nineties grunge. Always at dinner. Always with the eight. Always Thursday. The oldest was a daguerreotype. Nine blurred figures. One of them had my posture. My smile.

I went to New Hope Photo. Asked if someone was developing photos under my name.

“Just like always,” the clerk said.

Apparently, I’d been a customer since 1987. Different film types, different payments—but the same name, same address. She handed me an envelope. Thirty-six exposures from last Thursday. Photos of me laughing, toasting—but wearing a face that looked increasingly like Marcus.

“Want to pre-pay for next week?” she asked.

I did. Automatically. Exact change, just like always. At home, the daguerreotype now hung above a fireplace that hadn’t existed that morning. Marble mantle. Candlesticks I’d “inherited” from a grandmother who was still alive in Florida—and had never owned silver.

My phone rang.

“Dinner at Henry’s,” Graham said. “Seven sharp.”

“I know,” I heard myself say.

“Bring the ’82 Bordeaux.”

“I will,” I replied—though I didn’t own one.

But when I opened my wine rack, there it was. Dusty. Waiting. And I remembered buying it. Storing it. Tending to it. No—I didn’t. Marcus did. Or Thomas. Or whichever version of me lived here last. I was being overwritten. By memories that weren’t mine but *fit*me. Like clothes broken in by someone else. Like a house slowly reassembling itself around the shape of who I was becoming.

And the worst part? It felt like home. As much as my brain was telling me to get out of here, my body wanted to stay. 

**WEEK SEVEN – THE MIRROR GAME**

I tested a theory. By now, my house couldn’t decide what century it belonged to. My bathroom had both a clawfoot tub and a smart shower that flickered in and out of existence. My fridge was sometimes an icebox, complete with blocks of ice that weren’t there the day before. Physics had packed up and left.

But nightmares follow rules. Patterns. And I’m good at patterns. So Thursday afternoon, before dinner at Henry’s, I ran an experiment. I set a mirror at the center of my dining table—not one of the ornate antique ones my house had started producing like mold, but a plain handheld mirror I bought that morning at CVS. Modern. Mine.

The ninth chair loomed at the head of the table, unmoved and unmovable. I’d tried once to drag it into the garage. Woke up bruised and sore with the chair back in its place, smug and waiting. So I left it. I sat at a normal seat. One place setting. One unscented candle. A glass of cheap wine with a screw cap. I wasn’t going for elegance—I was testing reality.

I felt ridiculous. Like a kid saying “Bloody Mary” into the mirror for a scare. But when I lit the candle, the flame burned *burgundy*. The wine in my glass turned dark and rich without me sipping it. The mirror’s surface rippled, though I hadn’t touched it.

“To Marcus,” I said. “May the ninth chair always be filled.”

My voice came out polished, ceremonial—like I’d said it a thousand times. Nothing happened.

The candle flickered back to orange. The wine soured. The mirror showed only me—tired, drawn, circles under my eyes from too many nights of shallow sleep.

I was about to give up. Blame stress. Blame gas. Blame whatever supernatural HOA managed this nightmare of a town.

Then I noticed the silence.

Not quiet. *Silence*. The kind that presses against your eardrums and makes your breath sound loud. My house had never been silent—there was always music, creaking, whispers in languages I couldn’t place. But now: stillness. Weighted. Watching.

I looked back at the mirror. My reflection wasn’t alone. Eight figures stood behind me. Not shadows—*absences*. Voids where light didn’t go. Each stood behind a chair, hands resting like mourners at a wake.

I didn’t turn. I *knew* if I turned, they’d vanish. This was mirror truth. Reverse honesty. The kind that only shows up when you stop trying to see it. The figures sharpened. I could make out the shapes: Graham’s tall frame. Theo’s restless fingers. Henry’s rigid stance. All in their seats. All smiling. Not visibly—but I *felt* the smiles. Proud. Expectant. The kind you give a child who finally ties their shoes. Not surprised. Just satisfied.

Rocco’s shape—broader than the rest—raised a glass. The others followed, synchronized as ever. A silent toast.

*To Marcus,* their gesture implied.

*To Julian,* it corrected.

*To the Ninth,* they agreed.

And I felt it—heatless, voiceless warmth. Approval. I blinked. They were closer.

Still behind the chairs, but leaning now, shadows stretching like fingers across the mirrored table. One—Bennett, maybe—touched the back of the ninth chair. I felt it on my neck. Cold. Deliberate.

Then, in the mirror, my reflection spoke:

“Always nine.”

But I hadn’t moved my lips.

**WEEK EIGHT – WHO IS MARCUS?**

I needed facts. Real, dusty, microfiche-level facts. Something outside my shifting house and misbehaving mirrors. The Free Library of New Hope sat squeezed between a wine bar and a crystal shop. Inside, it still smelled like old paper and quiet ambition—the way libraries should.

The librarian, ancient in the timeless way of people who never retired, didn’t ask questions.

“Obits from 2009?” she said. “Basement. Microfilm before 2010. Digital after.” The basement stairs creaked like a countdown. The air smelled like mold and memory. I found 2009 easily. November—Thanksgiving.

I scrolled past strangers until I saw it: **Marcus Langley. Age 34. Died suddenly.**

Two sentences. No cause of death. No survivors. No funeral details. Just a name, an age, and *suddenly*—as if death had ambushed him. I printed it. The paper came out warm, damp, the ink already blurring.

Next, I searched for photos. The librarian had mentioned yearbooks—full collection back to the ‘50s. *Town pride,* she’d said. I did the math. If Marcus was 34 in 2009, he’d have graduated in 1995. I found him on page 47. It was like looking into a mirror. Not a resemblance. *Me.*

Same eyebrow scar. Same crooked left ear. Same exact face. But in 1995, I was five years old, living in Jersey. Under his photo: Drama Club. Debate. *Thursday Dinner Society.* The name alone chilled me. And the friend quotes?

“Never change, Marcus!” – G.M.  
“Nine is divine!” – T.K.  
“See you at dinner forever!” – R.P.

His senior quote? **“Most likely to never leave.”**

Not a joke. A prophecy.

I flipped pages. Found a photo on page 173: nine teens around a dinner table in the home ec room. Eight familiar faces—young versions of Graham, Theo, the rest. Unmistakable, even with bad haircuts and teenage awkwardness.

At the head: Marcus. Me. Not me.

The caption: *Thursday Dinner Society celebrates another year of culinary excellence and friendship. Meetings every Thursday, same time, same place, forever and always.*

Then I looked closer—really studied the others. They looked *Marcus’s* age. Which meant if they were 18 in 1995, they should be in their late 40s now. But they weren’t. Graham maybe looked 45, but Bennett still looked 25. Jude maybe 30. Unless they hadn’t aged. Or had aged before. Or had graduated other years, other decades, other lives.

Unless Thursday Dinner wasn’t bound by time. I photocopied everything. Fed quarters into the machine until I had a pile of pages and proof. The last copy jammed, distorting Marcus’s face—our face—into a kaleidoscope of features that weren’t mine but might be.

I stumbled upstairs. The librarian looked up over her half-moon glasses.

“Find what you were looking for?”

“I don’t know,” I said.

She smiled. For a moment, she looked *younger*.

“They always come looking eventually,” she said. “The ninth ones. Trying to understand what they already know.”

I ran. Out past the wine bar, past the crystal shop, past people living in a world where mirrors behaved and houses didn’t rearrange themselves in the night.

At home, I laid the copies on my now-longer dining table. Studied Marcus’s face. My face. Our face. Until the lines blurred.

*Most likely to never leave.*

Not sentiment. Not praise. *Instruction.* Because the ninth chair doesn’t let you go. Because Marcus didn’t leave. Because no one ever really leaves. I was the new Marcus. Or the next version. Or the same version in a different decade. A face recycled. A role filled. A dinner that never ends. And I wasn’t arriving. I was *returning*.

I had always been here. Just waiting for myself to catch up.

**WEEK NINE – THE DINNER**

They asked me to *officially* host. Not invited—*asked*. Like it was owed.

Graham called Tuesday morning while I stared at yearbook pages, trying to find a difference between Marcus’s face and mine. There wasn’t one.

“Your turn again,” he said. “Thursday. The ninth dinner. The penultimate.”

Of course. Nine chairs. Nine members. Nine dinners since I met them at the Logan Inn. But how many cycles before me? How many ninths had counted to nine before dissolving?

“Next week is the tenth,” he said. “And you know what that means.”

I didn’t. But a part of me nodded anyway.

“I don’t—” I started, but stopped. Because I did. I *knew* how to host. The knowledge sat in my brain like furniture uncovered after a long absence.

 “Seven o’clock,” Graham added. “Don’t worry about the menu. It’s already decided.”

He hung up. I didn’t say yes. I didn’t need to. My answer had been written before I was. Tuesday and Wednesday passed in a trance. My hands wrote lists in a stranger’s handwriting. My feet took me to specialty shops I didn’t know existed. The shopkeepers greeted me by name. One corrected himself:

“The usual, Mr. Langley—I mean, Vance.”

But we both knew he’d been right the first time.

By Thursday, the house had decided on Victorian. Ornate wood, candlelight, a kitchen outfitted in copper and cast iron. Meals were prepared without my help. Place settings appeared on their own. At 6:45, candles lit themselves.

At 7:00 they arrived. No knock. No door opening. Just *presence*.

“Julian,” Graham said, but it felt like he was addressing someone much older.

They moved through the space like they’d always lived there. Bennett adjusted a fork by millimeters. Theo tuned the silence. Henry checked the wine I didn’t remember buying but had clearly been saving for this. No one cooked. No one poured. But the food came, and the wine flowed. The table served itself. Time bent around us.

“Beautiful evening,” Rocco said, though the windows showed only night.

“The ninth dinner,” Trevor said, lifting his glass. “Always special.”

“Always final,” Jude whispered.

“Not final,” Henry corrected. “Transitional.”

They sat with perfect precision. Suddenly I was seated at the head. The ninth chair. I didn’t remember sitting down. The table felt warm beneath my palms. The courses passed like dream scenes. Soup flavored with memory. Salad that shimmered. The duck—always the duck. Each bite brought flashes: different eras, same faces, same ritual. They spoke in riddles. Recollections from times that hadn’t happened yet. Dinners in cities that no longer existed. Ninths who had come before.

“Where do they go?” I asked. “The old ones?”

Eight faces turned to me. Smiling.

“Go?” Graham echoed. “They don’t go anywhere.”

“They’re always here,” said Theo.

“*You’re* always here,” said Henry.

And I understood. There was no replacement. Just accumulation. Marcus wasn’t gone. He was layered beneath me. And beneath him, others. All stacked in the ninth chair, century after century. At 9:09 exactly, they stood.

“To Marcus,” they said.

They looked at me.

“To Julian,” I tried to reply. But what came out was: “To Marcus.”

The voice was mine—but older. Hungrier. Practiced.

“May the ninth chair always be filled,” we said together.

The room spun. Time folded. And I *fell*—through Marcus, through Thomas, through names lost to memory. Identity layered like wallpaper, peeling back and back and back.

I woke in the ninth chair. Fully dressed. Alone. Hands folded on the table. The others were gone. The dishes clean. The candles burned down to stubs, but still faintly flickering. The house was… everything. Victorian and modern. Past and future. All times at once. I was still in my own clothes, but they *felt* different. Worn by someone older. A cufflink glinted on my wrist. Gold. Engraved. The letters shifted: J.L., M.L., T.P.—names that had worn this chair before me.

I removed it with practiced fingers. I had never worn cufflinks, but my hands had. I held it to the light—and saw: other hands, other nights, other dinners. A chain of selves, infinite and recursive, discovering what they already knew.

**THIS WEEK**

The day after the ninth dinner, it was like all 8 of them ceased to exist in the real world. Their homes are empty. The entire town seems to think I’m crazy when I ask about them.

And yes, I’ve checked. I’ve walked past each address from the past nine weeks. Graham’s grand colonial sits dark and completely empty now. Elliott’s glass cube of a house now wears three FOR SALE signs. Theo’s brownstone has no furniture—just dust dancing in light that doesn’t come from any known source.

But I *remember* being inside. I remember the meals. My body still carries their weight. My tongue still recalls the wine.

Even online, they’re ghosts. No more Instagram profiles. No digital footprints. I even paid for background checks—empty. I hired a private investigator who called me sounding spooked.

“These people can’t exist,” he said.

“But they do,” I told him. “Every Thursday at 9:09 PM, they exist harder than anything else.”

The Logan Inn—the bar where I first met them—claims no knowledge of Graham or anyone in the group.

“No parties of eight,” the manager insisted, scrolling their records. “Not ever.”

I showed her the receipt from that night. She squinted like it was in a foreign language. The ink must have shifted—showing a date from 2005.

“You feeling okay?” she asked. I laughed until she threatened to call someone.

Who would she call? The police? The therapists who’d offer diagnoses for conditions older than language?

That next night, I see them walk down my street. I watch from my window. Eight figures in sync stopping at my door. They didn’t knock. Didn’t speak. Just stood there—waiting. Smiling. Their smiles said: *We have time. We are time.*

They stood for what my clock called a minute, but my bones measured in centuries. Then they were gone. Not walked away. Just… gone. As if a channel had changed. The porch light glowed over empty space.

I found myself at the door without remembering how I got there. Opened it. Stepped onto a porch that was wood, stone, and ancient dirt all at once. The street was silent. No cars. No dogs. No life. Just me and the weight of something watching.

Something glinted on the doormat—a gold cufflink. Matching the one in my pocket. Matching the ones I keep finding like breadcrumbs dropped in reverse. It was warm. Recently worn. When I straightened, I wasn’t alone. A figure stood just beyond the porch light. Not one of the eight—I knew their shadows. This was someone else. 

Marcus. Not the memory. Not the metaphor. The *Marcus* from the photo. Sharp. Hungry-eyed. Wearing the burgundy shirt from the Thanksgiving image—and my skin remembered how that shirt felt.

“You’re doing well, Julian,” he said. His voice was mine, but in a minor key. “Better than Thomas. He fought it.”

 “You’re dead,” I said. It felt important.

 “Am I?” He stepped forward.

“I was at dinner last week. And the week before. I’ll be there next week. Death is just transition, Julian. Or would you prefer *Marcus* now?”

“My name is Julian,” I said. But it felt like reciting a spell I no longer believed.

Marcus smiled—*my* smile, but older. Practiced.

“Names are clothes. I was Marcus for thirty-four years. Thomas before that. William before him. The time changes. The role doesn’t.”

“What are you?” I asked. “What are *they*?”

“Hungry,” he said.

He touched my chest. His hand passed *through* me, into the space where identity lives. I didn’t feel pain. I felt… subtraction. Like shrugging off a coat.

“The others are aspects. Functions. Graham is welcome. Theo is rhythm. Henry is authority. They exist because the dinner does. And the dinner exists to feed the hunger.”

“Fed on what?”

“Time. Identity. The tiny deaths we suffer when we try to be someone else.”

He withdrew his hand. My chest ached in its absence.

“You’ve been feeding it for nine weeks now. Each dinner, you become less Julian. More… us.” 

“I want to leave,” I said.

But what I *heard* was: “I want to stay.”

Marcus stepped back. I saw through him—not transparently, but like layers: Thomas, William, others. Acetate ghosts.

“You came to New Hope to disappear. We let you. Gave you a new place to exist, a new role. A family that never leaves.”

“This isn’t what I wanted,” I whispered.

“Oh, but it is. You *chose* the ninth chair, Julian. You walked straight to it.”

He was already fading, like a photo left in the sun.

“Next Thursday everyone will return for your tenth dinner. Then the transition completes. I’ll rest. You’ll remain.”

“What if I don’t come?”

He laughed—*my* laugh, but stretched by centuries.

I watched vids and read some research, all saying Lion's Mane is healthy and can taste like meat or crab or shrimp depends on prep, but better - it's easily grown local unlike shrimp dragged out from south Pacific bottom sitting there with random waste.

1lqegwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/queer/comments/1lqegwf/i_put_on_my_real_face_lgbt_fiction/,I Put On My Real Face -- LGBT+ Fiction,"It finally came about a month ago. The delivery I’d been waiting for.

I didn’t know what was in the box at first. It actually worried me that night when I first got home and saw it sitting outside the door because there was no shipping label---no note[.](https://scottsavino.com/i-put-on-my-real-face) Just a plain cardboard box.

*Who would just leave some unmarked box outside my door?* I wondered, a bit worried at first.

I decided to bring it inside and open it.

I couldn’t help but laugh giddily and squeal to myself when I pulled back the flap and saw the face inside, resting on a nest of tissue paper.

I ordered it so long ago, I’d forgotten to keep an eye out for it. It wasn’t exactly the face I’d ordered, but really, really close. Close in the way I might have drawn myself with colored pencils as a teen. 

Not perfect, but *perfectly me.* 

I’d invented this face a dozen times in my head but I’d never seen it out loud. I’d read the warnings on the website that everyone’s idea of the perfect face might not match the mask they get, and that was true---I didn’t get exactly what I thought I was getting---what I got wasn’t perfect---the freckles were in the wrong spots. I expected it to have lips that weren’t quite this big and the cheekbones weren’t as prominent as I’d requested them to be…

I was just so happy with it anyway, because if I’m honest, I wasn’t sure what I was getting when I ordered---not really---and what they delivered to me was perfectly imperfect.

The surface of this mask wasn’t rubbery the way I’d worried it might be. It was smooth, the rich brown of the skin matched my skin tone perfectly and it wasn’t glossy like a Halloween mask might be. It didn’t have any strings or clasps. You just slip it over your head and you can wear it wherever you go.

I wasn’t expecting it to be as soft as it was---the feel of the skin so tender and realistic---and I definitely wasn’t expecting it to be warm when I pulled it over my head and started wearing it.

It fit my face like a familiar friend I’d forgotten and accidentally stumbled into at Walmart or something---you know the kind of interaction I mean, don’t you?---you run in the store just to grab something right quick and you bump into someone you haven’t seen in a real long time out of nowhere and you get to talking, catching up…as you do…and before you know it, you’ve spent almost an hour talking to some girl you haven’t even seen since you were fifteen years old…and the best part is it’s as though you never missed a beat with her at all. It fit me kinda like that. It was seamless and the nose holes were aligned perfectly. When I looked at it in the mirror and blinked, the mask blinked with me. When I smiled, it smiled. 

I was so happy with it that I slept in it.

\--------------------------------------------------------

Nobody acted like anything was different about me, which was what I hoped for, but hadn’t expected. Not entirely. I knew the mask would be good, but I never expected wearing it would feel so natural. I definitely didn’t expect it to go almost completely unnoticed. But, I was living in a new city, after all.

“And what’s the name for the order, miss?” my barista that first morning asked.

I don’t know why I expected him to flinch when I told him my name---but that isn’t what happened---he just wrote it down and called out “Tiana” when my order was ready and nobody looked at me sideways when I went up from the community table in the waiting area to collect it.

*Could this be real life?* I wondered. *Can nobody tell that I’m wearing this?* But, it was true, they couldn’t tell. 

But, there’s more because that wasn’t the only thing that changed for me that first morning---tons of people were wearing masks---I could see them everywhere and they seemed so obvious to me now. 

Mine wasn’t cheap…

…but people all around me were wearing cheap ones. Something about my own mask made seeing the outlines of a phony face easier---more apparent…people just slapped these knockoffs over their true faces but those knockoffs didn’t fit them as perfectly as mine fit me. Most of their masks cast very noticeable shadows on their faces beneath that I could see---*shockingly clearly, actually*---now that I wore a mask of my very own.

A man on the subway wore one. It was sharp jawed and too angular for his skull. The eyeholes were wrong and I could tell right away by the shadows around his eyes.

A little boy near me could see it too---”Mommy,” he asked, “Why is that man’s face melting?”

And his mother shushed him to stop talking.

I’d never realized it before that first morning---lots of people---most people I passed actually, were all wearing them, covering their true faces beneath with masks they thought the rest of the world would find more pleasing than the real faces they were hiding.

When I say I started to see them everywhere, I really do mean *everywhere.*

\--------------------------------------------------------

The first few days felt like freedom.

This was the face I wanted. I could walk down the street without second-guessing myself. I could breathe. Nobody stared at me and the type of weirdos who ask people things that they shouldn’t be asking didn’t ask me nothing---mostly.

I had a few experiences that were actually quite frightening, if I’m being honest.

The one that sticks out in my mind was that old bitty who didn’t mind her own self the way she should’ve been minding her own self and just leave me be the way she should have left me be.

It was early evening and she came out the doors of St. Marinos Cathedral as I passed it. I walked by that church every day---it was a spooky old gothic thing that sat in the center of my modern city like a wart, and this old lady was one of the wart-hairs. 

What needs to happen is for people like her to get plucked---child, that’s what I think---I really, really do. Nobody wants to buy nothing you’re selling, ma’am.

I didn’t realize she’d been following me---not at first---I just thought we were headed the same way. It wasn’t until the 4th block that I realized she was trying to keep up with me. I could hear her little kitten pumps tap-tap-tapping trying not just to match my stride, but to beat it so she could catch up to me. 

I turned back, glancing over my shoulder and gave her one of those up-and-down’s that you do when you’re trying to figure someone else out.

She didn’t look like she was wearing a mask---not at first---not until she opened her mouth.

“Hello, sweetheart,” she said, sweet, but not real sugar. She said it Splenda sweet… “Such a pretty face. New?”

I didn’t know at first what to say, so when I collected my jaw from the sidewalk, the first thing out of my mouth was “Excuse me?”

“Oh, I know a mask when I see one. I’m not judging you, dear, I’m really not,” she said. “I’m just worried.”

That’s when I noticed the light glowing around the seams of her mask. It was pouring out of her mouth. She smiled those too-white dentures at me nice and big. That was when she pulled her own mask off and I could see that both of those plates---the top and the bottom one---had way too many teeth. 

The blinding white of that light was pouring out of every crack she had as she kept going on.

“You’re lying to yourself. Everyone else is lying to you too. You see that don’t you?”

That glow was coming out of her mouth like a spotlight directly into my eyes. I couldn’t even see her awful teeth anymore. It was just that blinding light. It came out from everywhere… 

She breathed it out her nose. 

It shot out of her eyes.

It even came out of her ears.

“You know who doesn’t lie?” She asked, waiting for me to respond. I didn’t.

She didn’t blink. “God. He can see who you really are.”

I turned around and started to double my steps. I just wanted to get away from her. 

“Miss? Hey miss---he sees you. You know that don’t you? You think that mask hides you from Him?” She shouted after me.

I turned around.

“Lady, didn’t you just come out of a church?” I asked her, “following people at dusk like this---shouting at them---it isn’t very Christian of you. Go on home. Leave me alone and worry about yourself.”

Her face-glow flared brighter. I don’t know how any of this stuff works---not really. She hadn’t been wearing her mask for a few minutes, but taking it off did something to her. It made her real hot---I don’t mean mad, but she was that too---what I actually meant was I could see her heating up from the inside now. 

Hers must’ve been keeping her cooler on the inside, because once she took it off and gripped it in her angry fist, she started to look hot---*actually* hot. Smoke rose from all the same spots that had glared that light at me. It must’ve been happening the whole time. I just stood there, stunned, and watched her face begin to melt.

It dripped right off her skull---pink smears of coral lipstick landing on her purse strap, purple eyeshadow sliding down her blouse. Her cheeks puddled on the sidewalk like candle wax, and then that little cotton-ball of hair on her head burst into flames.

I ran all the way home.

For the first time since I got my mask, I felt unsure. I checked it in the mirror and blinked. It blinked too---but just a beat or two late. When I smiled, it smiled back… but for a second, it looked like I had too many teeth. Ten or fifteen too many. Then I blinked again and the teeth were gone---but the smile still looked off. Like it wasn’t smiling right.

I didn’t think it was going to adjust back to working right the next morning when I woke up to go to work, and I cried real hard that night before I fell asleep. Harder than I’ve cried in a long time. 

And I thought about taking it off and putting it in the trash.

But I decided not to.

When I woke up the next morning I realized I’d let myself get worked up about something I shouldn’t have and everything about my mask was back to normal.

\--------------------------------------------------------

The more I wore it, the more normal it felt to have, even with my moments of doubt. I’d wake up, breathe and stretch. I’d check it in the mirror for creases. There were never any creases. 

There better not be. This mask cost me a fortune.

In mirrors, the face was completely mine now. I didn’t worry about it not synching up with my movements because it moved like skin. It flushed when I got nervous. It got darker in the cheeks when I ran on the treadmill so fast I ran out of breath…

That second or third week, after my encounter with the church lady, I started noticing other people whose masks had that light coming out of them. They stared just a little bit too long, until those stares turned into glares and it was like they were trying to pick me apart.

\--------------------------------------------------------

Yesterday---now, yesterday was the best day I had since that unmarked cardboard box got delivered to my door.

I was sitting at the cafe on my lunch break, reading, and I noticed a man there looking at me and when I noticed him and we locked eyes well, I saw the seams of his mask glowing, but it wasn’t glowing in the same way that the people who glared at me seemed to glow. I could see the whole outline of his mask…

Where it met with his chin…

And around the eyeholes…

And the noseholes…

It was amazing. Gleaming light that seemed to sparkle like a prism or a diamond…and while he smiled at me, he lifted his coffee up in a silent toast and that’s what made me want to get up and say hello to him.

I approached him and asked, “What is it about you that seems so familiar?”

And he said gently: “I like your mask.”

I just stood there dumbfounded and didn’t respond right away because it was the first time that I’d ever seen someone who wore a mask that did that.

“It took me forever to get my face right, too.” He said, “It’s shining right? Looks like diamond light.”

I paused, “Yea. About that. I haven’t seen a mask do that before?”

The glowing flickered and I could see the face he had beneath his mask. He was about my age, and his eyes were as tired as I felt but still very kind. He had a lip piercing. Was it his mask or his real face? I couldn’t tell. It looked like a real face.

“I’m not wearing my mask. Not anymore,” He said. His skin seemed to be alive, glittering around the edges like tiny soft creatures draped in white danced around the outline of his face, gracing him with their radiant kiss. “I stopped having to wear it a long time ago. Just keep wearing yours and your face will shine exactly like mine is. The best part about it is I can see my own face sparkle in the mirror the same way you’re seeing it now. It took a while for the face I had on underneath to adapt and change---get molded just right---but one day I woke up and I finally felt it was safe to take mine off…so I took it off. I’ve been shining ever since.”

“How long did you have to wear it before you started to---uh---well, you know?”

“A while, but it’s different for everyone.”

I told him I had to get back to work, and he said he had better do that too and I smiled as pretty as I could make myself do for no reason at all. I was acting just like a silly little teen again. I felt giggly inside as I did it, but I just couldn’t stop smiling.

He gave me his number before he headed on his way.

We’re getting dinner tonight and I haven’t been this excited in a long, long time.

If you’re thinking about getting one of these masks and you’re wondering how good they are---listen, you don’t have to spend the kind of money I spent on mine to shine like that, if you want to do it, I mean, sure go ahead...but...I don’t think you have to spend any money at all.

Before we parted ways he told me something.

Something I didn’t even know was possible for someone to do.

Now listen, I’m happy with the money I spent on mine, but honey if you ain’t got the cash, I’m telling you, you don’t need it. 

Not really.

Because what he told me was this:

All it took was a little patience.

A few temporary masks that were a little strange.

Some that didn’t sit just right.

Eyeholes a little crooked on the first few go-arounds…

But he kept trying and trying and started getting better at it.

And one day, he said he’d got enough practice to do what he meant to do, and he just did it.

He said he *made* the one he used to wear *himself*.

1lqee96,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rosacea/comments/1lqee96/profhilo_and_baby_botox_for_rosacea_flare_control/,Profhilo and baby Botox for rosacea flare control— just my experience,"Hey everyone, just wanted to share something that’s really helped me with papular pustular rosacea.

For me, it flares up hard when my gut’s off, especially when I travel. I’ve been trying to treat methane SIBO for a while, and more recently realised sulfur intolerance might be the missing piece. (When I travel its often double coffee, eggs for breakfast, margaritas at dinner... basically sulfur bomb central. Major bummer.) Dermatologist wasn't super helpful they just recommended solantra which Im not convinced has a big impact.

Anyway, I recently saw a cosmetic doctor and explained what was going on. She recommended Profhilo in the lower face and baby Botox in the forehead to help hydrate the skin, calm inflammation, and manage oil.

Honestly, it’s changed my life. I used to get angry red flares every time my gut acted up. Now, even if my gut’s not happy, my skin stays calm. I’m not saying it’s a cure, but it’s been a total confidence saver.

I’ll include a few pics:

* First is a collage of my worst flares
* Second is me now, with just sunscreen and fake tan
* Third is with BB cream, bronzer, and lipliner

Totally get that this approach won’t be for everyone, and for me it’s definitely a bit of a bandaid. But as someone pushing 40, the whitehead flares were really affecting my confidence at work and socially. I found myself staying home more. That’s not the case anymore.

What a wonderful place you have!,"We are North Indians who came to visit Thrissur and it was a fabulous trip. I would keep the best part at the end of this post.

We visited Vadakkumnathan Temple and Guruvayoor Temple. Both the temples left us spell bounded. The architecture, particularly Vaddakumnathan, is so different and the rituals are so unique. We loved the premise of the Vadakkumnathan temple with huge trees and peace. Everybody was so quite and well behaved. Thankfully my kids got to see the elephants at Guruvayoor.

We visited the Chavakkad beach and our children went bonkers seeing the ocean. I had posted earlier in this sub-reddit and people advised us against Athirapally Falls but we went ahead and went to the falls. It is monsoon so I think the beauty of the Athirapally Falls was at full bloom. Our jaw dropped seeing the place, especially the road from Chalakudy to Athirapally. Literally scenic beauty from the heavens since I belong to a dry and hot place.

Since it was religious sort of a trip, we preferred vegetarian food. Hotel Bharath and Pathan's were our place to go and we loved the food. Man the authentic Mallu Puttu, Dosa and Idiyappam with Kadla curry or Korma stew were so delicious. Had our coffee at Indian Coffee house and liked it as well.

Somebody suggested us to go to Poomala Dam and the place did not disappoint. There is nothing very special about the place but you feel good there. Again we went to the stream flowing and spent a jolly time. In the evening, we relaxed at the park of Vadakkumnathan temple in front of Indian Coffee House. We sat there with our kids enjoying running up and down the slope. Our only wrong decision was to go to Sobha Mall - I mean it was just a mall and we could have visited other places.

The best part is THE PEOPLE. We treated so well and kindly by the people who helped us throughout the trip. May be some auto chettas overcharged us but that is fine. The bus driver from Thrissur to Chalakudy was driving as if he had just seen Brad Pitt's F1 movie. LOL!

I want to know if it’s the same for you guys and if it’s annoying or if it’s just kind of second nature now? ,2,1751509787.0,tacobell,11,0.75,False

I had no plan to upgrade for a long while (if ever) until I came across an opportunity to buy a Lelit Mara X v2 for $800. Owner says it was used for 4 months then put in storage and is now selling it. All original equipment is included. 

Can anyone with experience with both machines give insight as to if the upgrade is worth it? Figuring I should be able to sell my Anna for $500-600, the upgrade to the Mara isn't a ton of money. But I don't want to just spend money for something that isn't needed. 

I drink one espresso and one milk drink per day, I'm the only coffee drinker in the house. I have a Mazzer Philos grinder and typically like medium to light roasted beans. ",1,1751509597.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

My husband and I have been together six years, married for four. He has four kids from another marriage, one is grown and gone, One lives with us full-time 16 year-old female And the younger two live with their mom 50% of the time.
We were coming back from a trip a few weeks ago and had a layover in San Francisco early morning. It was my husband, myself and our 16-year-old. All of us love coffee. Since we were catching another flight, I wanted coffee, but not too much so I asked my husband to Get an extra large one so we can share. He and daughter left and came back with three coffees and a breakfast for her. they hand me a coffee, which was a surprise to me since I didn’t want a full serving, but I drink half and gave the rest to my husband.
Fast-forward an hour or so later. We are on our flight and daughter says she can’t finish her coffee. I agree with her that the coffees were really big and I didn’t finish mine either. She said hers and Dad‘s were extra big and that mine was different. I asked her what does she mean and she said that my coffee was from Burger King where she got her breakfast and theirs was from Petes coffee, which is where I had asked to get my coffee from..
My husband wasn’t sitting near us so I could not ask him about it. When we get off the plane and in our car to come home, I told him that I know he ended up giving me the crappier coffee. He told daughter that it was supposed to be a secret and not to tell me. 
So of course, this angers me and I tell him that he’s being an ableist and is taking advantage of my blindness. I felt like if daughter was getting a breakfast and a coffee comes with it then she should drink that coffee. he doesn’t think he did anything wrong and is standing his ground. He states that since I didn’t want my own coffee anyway that getting one from Burger King is not a big deal. Yes in the long run it’s not a big deal, but the fact that he use my blindness against me is the issue and I’m having a lot of trouble feeling like I can be with someone who sees nothing wrong and taking advantage of my blindness. so am I overreacting or do I have reason to stand my own ground?

I got my usual latte this morning and after my shift I drank a coldbrew coffee. When I got back to my apartment I walked in on my roommate being unfaithful to her boyfriend (in the living room btw) I’M MORTIFIED!! My anxiety has been sky high since then, why? IDK it could be the caffeine but it’s making me poop, my stomach is upset and cramping, and I have an insane amount of gas. It’s been 8 hours since that happened, and I’m currently at my boyfriend’s place. I was ok for a bit and ate some ice cream, but now my boyfriend is napping and everything came back!! I don’t want to wake him up just to annoy him with my phobia, even tho I know he wouldn’t be annoyed and comfort me as much as he can. I don’t want to wake him because he had a long day at work today and didn’t sleep much last night. I just need someone to talk to.",1,1751509566.0,emetophobia,1,1.0,False
