1klbnue,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1klbnue,Black stains and indentations in the teeth.,"I have searched all over and every post I come across is of adults who consume at some point coffee or tea. 

My child is 7, the stains started showing up probably late last year. I can scrape them but it takes time and have to be very gentle. 

I thought the toothbrush needed to be replaced. I got an electric one, didn’t work. I thought it wasn’t strong enough so I got a different brand. That one was too harsh on their gums. Went back to regular hand toothbrush. Their cleaning appointment finally came about a month ago. Teeth were cleaned. Dentist said it can happen with people who take medicine with iron in them. That not our case. No trauma to the teeth. After the cleaning all spots were gone. By the second week, they started showing up again. I’m at a loss and it is really stressing me out. Very few offices take their insurance but I would really like a second opinion.

I'm pretty shy, so for most of the year I wasn't really friends with the seniors. For whatever reason, in the last month or so I've been getting close with a few of my classmates, but especially this one girl. I'm finding it super hard to tell if she would genuinely want to keep being friends after she graduates. She acts like we're super good friends in person and will comment on my Instagram and stuff but never really reaches out first over text or Snapchat or anything. I'd really like to become better friends with her, but she has sort of a nonchalant personality so I can't tell what she's thinking. We have one AP exam left and then we might never see each other again. There's a good chance I'm going to attend the same college she's going to, so if we become friends we could still see each other all the time in a year. I know logically it's like ""just ask her to go for coffee or something what's the worst that can happen?"" but I can't convince myself and just don't know how to go about asking her to hang out without making things awkward since we joke all the time rather than talking about things like that idk.",1,1747104994.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

As a tourist, I can only warn other tourists: only a few people here handle money honestly.

Our conclusion after the trip: Varna is a beautiful place, but it has lost much of its appeal because of dishonest people.
Even in regular coffee shops there are incorrect bills or at the market, there are many petty scammers whose behavior can completely ruin the holiday atmosphere.

1klbhcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1klbhcz/i_wish_i_was_never_born_to_see_that_day/,I wish I was never born to see that day,"So my school holidays were going on, and my family thought that we should go out somewhere. Then in the evening we were having dinner when papa came home. He told us that he has planned a trip to the far away islands of Indonesia. Me and my younger brother were very happy to hear this. Mummy did not like this that much. Papa asked him what happened, mummy told him that there are only some islands of Indonesia which I have not yet fully explored and the island which papa had booked is also one of those. The name of that island was ""Bunuh bunuh island"" its English meaning is ""Kill Kill Island"". People say that dangerous tribals and strange things still roam on the deserted islands of Indonesia. One such strange thing is ""Orang itu"" whose English translation is ""That Man"". It is believed that very few people have seen it, then it can be said that very few people have survived who have seen it. And people believe that this Orang it lives in the Bunuh Bunuh Island. After hearing this, me and my brother got a bit scared because we were kids that time, and we would naturally be scared of such things. Then papa said to mummy, “It's nothing, these are just old stories made up by old people, nothing more than that, such things do not happen in today's time”. After hearing this, we felt a bit better and then mummy also agreed to go. 


- The day before going on a trip- We started packing because we had to go on the trip the next day. We were taking all our essential things like torch, lighter, etc. Papa came from outside after some time, he had gone to get some stuff but this time there was a stranger with him, Papa introduced us to him, ""Kids, meet him, he is my old friend Michael, he has travelled to the islands of Indonesia and he has agreed to go with us"", ""To go to such deserted islands, one definitely needs a guide, so it will be right to take someone along"", mummy said. Michael said, ""Hey kids, how are you both?"" ""I am fine uncle"", I said, then he gave us two toffees. He was a little fat and his eyes looked like those of an Asian. He must have been 50-60 years old. He had a straw hat on his head, farmer style, but despite all this, the strangest thing about him was his eyes were completely lifeless. This seemed a bit strange to me but due to the happiness of the trip I did not pay much attention and then Michael left. He said that he would come at 7 in the morning with the car. 

- Trip day - I was so excited about the trip that I couldn't sleep at night. I did not even realize when I fell asleep at night. Due to this, I was late in the morning and Mummy bit me hard, I woke up at 6:23. Then I went to the bar and started getting ready. Mummy brought breakfast. I don't remember it well but she had prepared some really plain breakfast. While we were having breakfast, we heard the sound of a horn from outside. Papa went and saw Michael standing inside. He had come to pick us up in a blue coloured van. Then after finishing breakfast we loaded the stuff into the car. Then the car started and we left for the trip. Idk maybe it took 1-3 hours to reach the airport, then we boarded the plane. It must have been 1-2 hours after boarding the plane. I was hungry and was waiting for the airhostess. When she came, I took a packet of snacks and gave a magazine to everyone. Most of the people did not even read the magazine and just kept it aside. I also did the same. Then I started feeling like it, so I picked up the magazine and started reading. On its last page, in a small box, it was written ""INDONESIA THE TREASURE OF TERROR"". It mentioned the amazing things about the islands of Indonesia. I had written about sightings, after seeing the title I thought it was a movie, and then I fell asleep and within 4-6 hours we were done. And then we went out and started looking inside. We saw a deserted old cabin. I and my brother lifted 2 small and thick suitcases and Mummy also lifted a big suitcase and Michael was also helping us.
Papa, we did not look towards the big cabin ahead, thinking there might be someone inside the cabin, but there was a man inside the cabin, he was the ranger of that place. Papa said to him ""Hey Officer"". He did not say anything in reply for 30-50 seconds, then he said in a deep voice ""Selamat datang di pulau kotor"". Its meaning is ""Welcome to the island of Gross"". Michael told us this, he knows Indonesian language. , Then the Ranger said ""Take care"" and gave Papa a Tomahawk (a spear that can be used to throw axe) and then Michael said ""This is your true companion in the jungle"" then we started walking ahead. I was just thinking that where will we stay in this jungle and what will we eat, I asked this to Papa and he told me ""This is not an ordinary trip, this is a camping trip, we will have 3x more fun in this than a normal trip"" I got very excited hearing this because after seeing camping trips in cartoons I felt that our camping trip will also be very fun but..... fate had something else in store.


We were just about to enter the jungle when it started raining and then we reached the cabin of some ranger at the door, where we stayed for 1-2 hours till the rain stopped. On this beach the ranger made hot coffee for us and after giving us coffee he started telling us about his jungle adventures, how he became a ranger from a simple 20 years old young boy, he told that there are more than 50 people on this island, during this conversation mummy asked him ""have you ever seen anything strange on this island"" the ranger said on hearing this ""cough if you want to live peacefully in this jungle then don't think about it and it will be better if we don't talk about it"" After hearing this I felt strange and also scared. By the time the conversation ended the rain also stopped and we had to leave the cabin inside. Maybe 3-4 o'clock in the evening. Komodo Dragons roam on these islands at night. That's why Papa and Michael started making a shelter. Michael had an 18-inch machete and he was collecting sticks with it for shelter. And Papa was collecting Vines wagera with the Tomahawk, it was 5:30 and it was completely dark all around, Mummy lit a fire with a lighter and Papa brought the fiber of an old coconut tree nearby and we started a bonfire with that, Michael was telling us stories of his old days, and I, my brother and my Mummy were making marshmallows and some other camping snacks in front of the bed, and in the middle of this we heard that sound...

It came from deep inside the jungle, that sound was as if it was the mixed roar of a goat and a mountain line, it was a sound that was to be heard in the ear, it echoed in our bodies after hearing it Goosebumps came, Papa and Michael took their weapons and then Michael said, ""I will go and see, you all stay here"" and then Papa said to him, ""Okay you be careful, I take care of them here"" saying this Michael disappeared into the jungle. We were just waiting for Michael to return, 1-2 hours had passed, we were just waiting for him, then Papa tied a fiber to a stick and set it on fire, this was their only source of light because Michael had taken the torch, now Papa also went into the jungle, we were very sleepy After 1 hour papa came and he said “Finding someone in such a big and deserted island in the darkness of night is like searching for a sheep in the forest, and I searched almost the whole island but I could not find Michael anywhere”. So thinking that we will get up in the morning and search for Michael, we all went to sleep. To tell you the truth, at that time I was feeling very scared. We were all alone on such a deserted island, that too without a guide. While thinking so much I fell asleep and went to sleep. After waking up in the morning, we ate just one can of canned food and got ready to search for Michael. We divided ourselves into 2 teams, me and dad in one team, my brother and my mother in another team and then we went to search for him. We were checking every bush and tree thoroughly, but it was very risky too because dangerous Komodo dragons live in most of the islands of Indonesia, which are also called the Dragons of this era, and if anyone among us gets bitten, there is no hospital here to help us. The more we were roaming in the island, the more we were shocked. On one side there was dangerous poisonous Ivy and on the other side there were bushes of wild berries, on one side there were big dark trees and on the other side there were beautiful colorful trees, it had been almost an hour and we had still not heard from Michael, so we returned and by mistake came near the Ranger's cabin, we went inside, we thought that Michael must have come here by mistake and must be sleeping inside, we went and knocked on the cabin door, then the Ranger came out and said ""what happened?"" Papa asked him ""what Have you seen the man coming with us?"" He said ""Oh real!"" (oh shit that's what it means) He asked ""why did you make us go out at night???? Don't you know about oranges? Now you can't even use God"" After saying this he closed the door with force.

We then started to panic, my health had worsened due to the fear. We went back to the jungle. Papa said, ""We will just take your mom and brother and go from here. We will not stay here even for a second. Why didn't I listen to your mummy…"" Then we started to look for brother and mummy. Half an hour had passed. We heard a loud scream. It was mummy's scream. It was coming from the west side. We both went inside the door. We saw my brother and mummy standing like statues and my brother was crying. I then went closer and asked, ""K-Kya H-HUA MUMMY A-WHY DID YOU CRY?"" Mummy without saying anything pointed her finger ahead and we saw on the other side...Michael's dead body.

That corpse was in very bad condition, probably in the worst way a human could ever imagine, his head was split in the middle, his face was split in two but it was still attached to his body, one of his hands was separated from his body and the intestines inside his stomach were all out, all the flesh on his chest was missing and right next to that carcass was a Komodo dragon which was eating Michael, but but but, the most terrifying thing was that when this was happening to Michael he was alive… yes he could feel that pain when he ate the Komodo dragon He was lying there, Papa seeing that he was alive went to him through the door ""MICHAEL! MICHAEL! HEY ANSWER WHO DID THIS TO YOU?!""
Michael somehow said
""O-O-ORA-A-NG ITU-U""
""WO-O-OH R-EA-L H-E!""
""T-TU-UM SA-ABH BH-AG J-AO!!""
Michael broke his last breath by saying this. Without even a second's time we started running away, without carrying any equipment we were just running, the jungle which we were able to cross easily a while back seemed like a maze, in whichever straight direction we went we kept coming back in the same direction, from above in the jungle the sound of monkeys was coming from the tall trees which was making the atmosphere even more frightening, I and my brother started crying, papa held my hand and mumny held my brother's hand and then we were just running like blind deer.

We were all very tired, around 2-3 We were running in a loop for hours and there was no way out but our body left us, ""If we keep running like this on a deserted island, it will just be a waste of energy"", my mother said. Then we all sat down in one place to save our energy, we took a protein snake each, then mother said, ""The compass is not working because of the magnetic fields here, maybe if we reach the tree somehow and keep going in the direction where the sun is setting, we can get out of the island"", then my father heard this there The tree that climbs the easiest started climbing.

The most traumatic event of my life happened in this very beach.

I saw a black figure in the jungle far away… he was very short and was at least 10 feet tall. As soon as I looked at him, he quickly ran away from there in a second.

Then I turned around and looked at my brother…

WOH, that wasn’t it!!

I shouted ""MUMMY!!! Brother is not here""

Mummy was taking water from the nearby river for us, then she turned around and saw that brother is not here

She started panicking

""Oh shit what happened!!! Oh Ram what happened, how will we search in such a big jungle now,
Why did you go to me to fill water?"" After saying this she started cursing herself and started crying, to tell you the truth it is not her fault, if there is any mistake in this it was my mummy who was filling water, I was just sitting idle and I used to stay with her My brother is lost,

Mummy's crying Sun's father came down from the tree,

""What happened? You have to say everything right, he is a second child???""

Mummy started crying louder

Papa understood what had happened

Without saying anything, he caught me and Mummy and started running towards the outside of the jungle. After 20 minutes we almost reached outside the jungle, then we heard the same roar...

But this time there was a child's voice too,

Yes, that voice was not anyone else's but my younger brother's, he was screaming in pain so loudly it seemed that his vocal cords would burst, Mummy was insisting that they should let them go, their child is in trouble, I was crying ,
Mummy fainted due to this shock, Papa also had tears in his eyes but he knew that if we follow that voice, none of us will come back alive today,

We had just reached the beach outside the jungle, then suddenly Papa stopped

I saw my tearful blurry eyes

I swear, I have never felt so disturbed

Those were blotchy figures but this time we were able to see every detail of his body in the light of the sun.
He was looking like a cave man, he was very muscular as if a Olympic body builder, he had hair all over his body and his face looked like an animal of the same species, there was blood all over his chest and he was licking it in his mouth

My younger brother's head

Papa could not control himself after seeing this, his tears were falling out, I screamed as loud as I could, the vocal cords of my cheeks were damaged,
Papa closed my mouth with his hands, he kept watching this for 5-10 minutes, then he went away without doing anything, taking my brother's head in his mouth, as fast as we could To get out of the island we went towards the ferry parked on the beach, we were lucky the ferry was still there otherwise we would have had to stay there another day and don't know what would have happened to us.

I can never forget that scene

When my mother regained consciousness she started crying. I and my father did not tell her what we saw. 6 months after this incident my mother and father got divorced.

I wonder what would have happened if my mother had put the head of her beloved son in the mouth of such a thing....

1klbfqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/1klbfqx/professional_musician_with_ssnhl/,professional musician with SSNHL,"hi there. just found this sub. i’m a professional musician (M50) and was diagnosed in late March with SSNHL in my left ear. i saw ENT within a few days of symptoms. The hearing loss in my left ear is all low freq. I was given high dose of oral prednisone for a week, and that seemed to help (ENT didn’t give me the shots). I have also been on diuretic for several weeks and that also seems to have helped. But my low freq hearing has yet to regain much (my low freq tinnitus is mild to moderate); though what has felt like intense pressure in my ear over the course of these weeks has seemed to reduce with the diuretic. I have a MRI scheduled next week and rheumatologist appt for full immunology work up. Obviously I have cut sodium and have quit coffee. 

I’ve really been in a dark place these past many weeks (and i’m not a dark, depressive person). Luckily, I have been able to perform on the concerts I had scheduled, but i haven’t taken any more upcoming gigs and i stopped all of my audio-editing work. I also run a music publishing company, so performing/editing isn’t my entire income. But it is a substantial part, and obviously music is a massive part of my being… practicing, performing, listening, thinking nearly nonstop about music most days. 

I’ve been a musician longer than I have memories from my life — started taking piano at 5 and went all the way to a doctorate in music performance. During these past weeks my wife and kids have been hugely supportive of me, and my colleagues/bandmates have also been a great help emotionally. But I’m still in severe shock, tbh. 

My original ENT is great; she’s highly experienced, but I have an appt with another ENT this month for 2nd opinion — a specialist for performing artists (i’m in NYC, so hoping the resources here can help!!)

I guess I’m just posting here for any advice or especially in case there are other musicians who have gone/are going through this, too. 

ok. thanks for reading.

1klbf22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Machupicchu/comments/1klbf22/peru_trip_report_43059/,Peru Trip Report: 4/30-5/9,"Just returned from an incredible trip to Peru, and I'm excited to share my experiences and tips!

**Itinerary:**

* **2.5 Days in Lima**
* **1.5 Days in Cusco**
* **1 Day in Sacred Valley (stayed in Aguas Calientes)**
* **2 Days in Cusco (including Machu Picchu)**

**Lima**

I found that 2 days was a perfect amount of time to explore the city's highlights. Lima is mostly known for food.

* **Day 1:** I started my day by strolling through Kennedy Park, where you can see the many cats. For lunch, I highly recommend Punto Azul for some amazing ceviche. In the afternoon, I walked it all off with a visit to Love Park and a pleasant walk towards China Park.
* **Day 2:** I took a city walking tour that included tickets to the Catacombs, which was very interesting. In the evening, I headed to Barranco for dinner and drinks (Clon is a must-try, so make reservations!).
* **Day 3:** Since I had some extra time before heading to Cusco, I visited the Huaca Pucllana ruins. While interesting, I wouldn't say it's a top priority if you're short on time since you'll see plenty of ruins around Cusco.

**Cusco**

For Cusco, I used CuscoPeru Travel Agency to book accommodations, tours, and transportation. While this was very convenient, it's worth noting that booking everything individually could be cheaper. I just didn't want to deal with booking Machu Picchu tickets/trains/bus! You could also do the popular 4-day trek to Machu Picchu, but I'm not much of a multi-day hiker.

Cusco's high altitude is something to consider. Some people fly in and immediately head to Ollantaytambo (the train station for Machu Picchu). However, I chose to stay in Cusco to acclimate and relax.

* **Day 1:** I grabbed a quick breakfast sandwich at the San Blas Market and then explored the city on foot. San Blas is a charming area with lots of stairs, art galleries, and stunning views.
* **Day 2:** I took an afternoon city tour and explored the surrounding areas. It's not essential if your time in Cusco is limited.

**Sacred Valley and Aguas Calientes: En Route to Machu Picchu**

I spent one day touring the Sacred Valley, which helped me get closer to Ollantaytambo. I stayed overnight in Aguas Calientes, the town at the base of Machu Picchu.

* **Day 1:** I visited Pisac and Ollantaytambo. If I could do it again, I would skip Pisac and instead visit Moray and Maras before heading to Ollantaytambo. The train ride to Aguas Calientes from Ollantaytambo takes about 1.5 to 3 hours. 
* You can't bring large luggage on the train, so you'll need to leave your suitcase at your Cusco hotel and bring a smaller bag or backpack for the night. All hotels are used to holding luggage for travelers visiting Machu Picchu.

**Machu Picchu and Return to Cusco**

* **Day 1:** I took a 30-minute bus ride up to Machu Picchu. I did Circuit 2, which offers the classic Machu Picchu view and allows you to explore within the site. I spent about 2-3 hours at Machu Picchu. After returning to Aguas Calientes for lunch, I took the train back to Ollantaytambo and then a 2-hour drive back to Cusco. If I were to do it again, I might consider staying overnight in Ollantaytambo to break up the long travel day, depending on the next day's plans, as most tours depart from Cusco.
* **Day 2:** The next day involved an early 4 am departure from Cusco for Rainbow Mountain, which is about a 3-hour drive away. Breakfast and lunch were included in the tour. This hike was my biggest concern due to the altitude, but it was surprisingly ok. I strongly recommend taking altitude sickness pills! The views at Rainbow Mountain were absolutely worth it.
* **Day 3:** On my final day in Cusco, I relaxed and visited Three Monkeys Coffee (reputed to be one of the best in the world!) and ate at/explored the San Pedro Market. I also treated myself to a spa day at Antigua, which included a hot tub, sauna, and massage (highly recommended!).

Cusco has a wide variety of highly-rated restaurants (4.5 stars and up), making it hard to choose. I ended up eating at Local twice because it was so good!

**Overall Tips:**

* **Safety:** I felt safe throughout my entire trip so it was nothing to worry about.
* **Cash/Tipping:** I tipped around 10% if it was great customer service. It’s not required but they will ask if every time if you are using card. It’s good to carry cash in Cusco/Aguas Calientes/Rainbow Mountain for water and little things.
* **What to Pack:** Bring layers, including a rain jacket or poncho, a hat, and sunscreen. The weather in Lima is warm, but it's much colder in Cusco and at Rainbow Mountain. We went at the beginning of dry season, but it was still rainy so I recommend going around mid to late May if you want to fully avoid the rain (and even then it's a toss up)
* **Altitude:** Bring altitude sickness pills, and avoid drinking too much alcohol in Cusco, especially the night before visiting Rainbow Mountain.",1,1747104742.0,Machupicchu,1,1.0,False

Use quality paint or wallpaper designed for durability.

  
Pair with neutral furniture for contrast.

Choose pillows in various shades of yellow.

  
Consider geometric prints, florals, or striped designs.

  
Layer them on existing neutral-colored cushions.

Last week I got a call from someone wanting to do a consultation. I had a short window open today, so I squeezed him in. Sent him a little form to return to me with some basic info to fill out and email back. Well, he never sent it back which happens a fair amount of the time. Didn’t cancel on him or anything because stuff happens and we can work around it. 

First thing this morning I got a phone call. Went something like this. 

Policeman: “Hello, my name is Mr. Policeman. I’m sorry to catch you off guard. I understand Mr. Consult called you at (insert extremely specific time) last week. Can I ask you some questions about that call?”

Now I’m thinking this is super weird and suspicious because we don’t do criminal defense and a police officer has no business calling to ask me about my communications.

Me: “Well, I’m sure you’ll understand that I can’t confirm I’ve received calls from any person, or provide details about the contents of any calls I receive.”

Policeman: “Yeah I figured and I understand. I’m just calling because Mr. Consult was found deceased and we believe his time of death was very shortly after a call placed from his phone to this number. It’s a routine investigation and we just want to know if it was him, what his demeanor and mood was, stuff like that. If you decide you have anything to offer, just call me back at this number.” 

Me: “… okay, thank you for the call.” 

Well, I was wondering if it was just the most dark prank call of all time. Didn’t clear the appointment because… maybe it was a mistake or something? Called to confirm the appointment and got his voicemail. That made me nervous.

About 10 minutes before the meeting was set to start, I got a call from his daughter. “I’m so sorry to call last minute and to have to deliver this news, but my dad died a few days ago, so he won’t be making it to his meeting with you.”

So instead of being productive, I spent that window of time sipping my coffee and staring off into the abyss while contemplating the brevity of life and what I’m doing with mine. So how are y’all doing today? Because I’m doing weird. ",23,1747104462.0,Lawyertalk,7,1.0,False

1klb7mx,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1klb7mx/surely_im_doing_something_wrong_here/,Surely i'm doing something wrong here...,"So over the last 2-3 months i've been actively dating. Now, i can't say i've actively tried to date ever, i've always been reactive to potential advances not making the moves myself. However, In the past 2-3 months I have went out with 5-6 women, each a stronger connection than the last and half of them making it to the 2nd and 3rd date..... Honestly I'm surprised i've went out with anyone with how low my confidence as been historically... This is where the positives stop....

Despite any chemistry, no matter how strong, for some unknown reason after 2nd/3rd date, no matter how well they say it's going theres 1-2 days silence or spotty texting and then ""i don't think we're a good fit"". No matter how much they claim they're happy with how its going or what. They all claim i've done nothing  wrong or ""im so thankful to have met you"" or whatever, but they never stick around. I don't quite know what's happening or why everything seems to fizzle out when it seemed so intense. For example the last one we saw each other from 3pm-1am, a whole afternoon/evening together, spoiling each other with gifts and such, \*intense\* chemistry and over the weekend....it just died off randomly. I don't understand man. It's so confusing...

I am half tempted to reach out to some women i've met IRL that i used to work with, one in particular we went for coffee just to catch up and were there for 4 hours just talking and it was a great time, but i had much less confidence then so idk if i burned that bridge or if i should even ask about it or what. Still have a few possible leads online but i'm wondering if these IRL ones could be better even though we haven't spoke since i left work in some cases or since post-coffee meet for that one. Probably worth noting i've liked the woman i went to coffee with for years and always thought  she had a partner. She subtly implied she didn't but we haven't spoken since about a month after that.

1klb6s4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1klb6s4/review_of_my_encore_alaskan_cruise_as_a_first/,Review of my Encore Alaskan cruise as a first time cruiser,"This was both my fiancés and my first time being on a cruise. Here were our takeaways.

Accommodations: I mentally prepared myself for a cramped space but the room didn't feel small at all! No complaints. The couch and the bed gave us our own separate spaces when resting between activities. I highly recommend the balcony. It was so nice to go outside or open the door for some fresh air whenever we wanted to. I spent hours during the Glacier Bay day reading on the balcony (the observation bay was packed) which was a wonderful and peaceful experience. Probably the best environment I've ever read in. We requested a mattress topper and a coffee maker for our room which were essential imo. 

Excursions: The transportation was terrible. In Ketchikan, they transported us in kids school buses. We couldn't sit normally because the seats were so close together and went over some major potholes on the way back. My fiancé has back issues and this really hurt her for the rest of the day. It was far more jolting than the Galaxy Pavilion rides which had specific warnings for people with back injuries. If I had the knowledge I have now, I would've arranged a shuttle or uber and booked the tickets directly with the lumberjack show to save money. In Skagway, they moved us from a little building designed to give protection from the wind and had us wait in the parking lot for 25 minutes for a late bus. It was incredibly windy and the windchill made it an uncomfortable endurance. Thankfully, we weren't late for the excursion and the bus journey and driver was comfortable and entertaining once it begun. In Juneau, the shuttle line looked to be a 45min-1hr wait so we took an $8 uber instead which was money well spent. 

The excursions themselves were fantastic. The highlight was the White Pass railway. Incredible views and we enjoyed standing outside on the train car through the mountains. Panning for gold and the lumberjack show were both fun.

Food: The specialty restaurants were amazing. We had the More at Sea package which came with 3 specialty restaurants and we ate at Cagney's, Scarpetta and Le Bistro. Being able to order 3 appetizers and 3 desserts EACH for these meals felt extremely generous and most of them were so delicious. We also felt very attended to by the waitstaff. 

The Local was nice for breakfast, as was the buffet. Taste & Savor was decidedly average, never terrible, never great. The kitchen was backed up the second time we dined there and we ended up leaving before dessert because we had to see a show. Not a big deal and that was the only instance we had a wait time. We realized that a significant amount of food on their menus were also available at the buffet and we became buffet diners for our nonspecialty meals after that. I enjoyed the variety and quality of the buffet. 

The drink service was good. They had an interesting variety of bars (mojito, whiskey, wine, brewery, among others).  I rarely had to wait more than a minute to get my drinks and it was nice to be able to get two at a time. 

Cruise Activities: I'm not typically a theater guy but the Choir of Man was an engaging performance. I liked the Beatles band and the casino, although it was interesting how they had to shut it down whenever we went into port. There always seemed to be something going on in the Atrium, which made for a fun hangout whenever there was nothing else to do. The games when they included people from the crowd were entertaining. It was warm enough to sit outside in Spice H2O and people were in the pool during the sail away party. Other than that it was too cold to sit above deck but that's what I expected. 

Disembarkation was smooth. We left our room at 8am, ate at the buffet until they announced we had to leave at 9am and walked off the ship with no line. 

Overall: Great vacation. 8/10. I'm curious to how NCL relates to other cruises and how our experience compares to other's NCL experiences. We went on this trip not really knowing whether we'd be ""cruise people"" but we had a fun time and I think we'll be booking another cruise next year! Any suggestions of where to go or how we could improve our next cruising experience are appreciated!",2,1747103999.0,Cruise,1,1.0,False

**Unpacking “Based Zeus - The GOD Approach”: Real Talk About Dating in 2025**

# What Is “Based Zeus - The GOD Approach”?

Let’s start from the top: *“Based Zeus - The GOD Approach”* is not your typical dating advice course. This is a **no-BS, results-based dating blueprint** created by YouTuber and dating coach Based Zeus. Unlike cheesy pickup artist routines or outdated “playbook” tips, this course promises real-life skills that help you talk to, attract, and date women *naturally*—without needing movie star looks or being a smooth-talking sleaze.

The key theme? **Dating is a skill you can learn.** And this program is like a cheat code to level up fast.

# Who’s It For?

This is for **guys tired of feeling stuck**—the ones who see girls they’re attracted to but freeze up. If you're the overthinking, anxiety-prone type who’s always in your head, “Based Zeus - The GOD Approach” is meant for you. Whether you're a complete beginner or someone who wants to improve their game, Zeus lays out a **step-by-step framework** that helps you stop overanalyzing and start taking action.

Spoiler: You *don’t* need to be tall, rich, or ripped.

# Why Does This Course Matter?

Simple: it *actually works.* Most dating content is either outdated, creepy, or vague. Zeus changes that. He includes **live infield footage** where his manager Benjamin does real cold approaches—like, literally talking to women on the street—and scores instant dates. These aren’t theory-based lectures. They’re **real-life breakdowns**, showing what works and why.

So why does that matter? Because seeing real success makes it way easier to believe it’s possible for *you* too.

# What’s Inside the Course?

Here’s the juicy part. The GOD Approach includes five core modules:

* **Mindsets of the GODS** – Reset your brain to build confidence and magnetism.
* **CRUSH Your Approach Anxiety** – Kick fear to the curb with tools that actually work.
* **Building Sexual Attraction Through Conversation** – Turn small talk into flirty fire.
* **How to Open Conversations Like A GOD** – Learn exactly what to say to start strong.
* **Real-Life Infield Breakdowns** – Watch real interactions, learn from breakdowns, and model success.

Each module builds your dating skillset like stacking LEGOs—except instead of a castle, you’re building your dream dating life.

# When and Where Can You Use It?

The beauty of “Based Zeus - The GOD Approach” is that it’s designed for **any place, any time**. Zeus promises that you’ll be able to approach women and start meaningful conversations whether you’re in a **party, coffee shop, or walking down the street**. It’s all about being spontaneous, grounded, and authentic—without needing some ""perfect scenario.""

Whether you’re in New York, London, or some tiny college town, the skills you gain here **transfer everywhere**.

# How Does It Work?

Here’s the truth bomb: attraction is about **how you make her feel**, not how you look. “Based Zeus - The GOD Approach” gives you *the mindset* and *the tools* to radiate confidence, have fun conversations, and get girls intrigued—and chasing.

You’ll learn how to avoid the friend zone, stop freezing up, and build **romantic tension naturally**. Zeus isn’t about tricks—he’s about **authentic value communication**.

# Final Thoughts: Is “Based Zeus - The GOD Approach” Worth It?

I’m in the early stages of exploring what it would take to open a small coffee shop in a California suburb — think more family-oriented, middle-income area than bustling downtown. I’ve worked in a few coffee shops in the past but never run one myself, and I’m trying to get a clearer picture of what’s realistic before diving too deep.



A few things I’d love to hear from anyone who’s been down this road:



* **Startup costs:** What did it actually cost to get your place open? Anything that totally caught you off guard or ended up way more expensive than expected?
* **Revenue:** If you’re open to sharing, what does year 1 revenue typically look like? And how long did it take for you to hit breakeven?
* **Monthly overhead:** What are your biggest ongoing costs outside of rent? Curious how labor, supplies, utilities, and things like POS systems shake out.
* **Lessons learned:** Anything you’d do differently if you were starting today? Was a full business plan worth it, or did you figure most of it out as you went?",1,1747103885.0,smallbusiness,1,1.0,False
1klb5ff,https://www.reddit.com/r/becomingsecure/comments/1klb5ff/releasing_the_need_for_lots_of_contactcontrol/,“Releasing” the need for lots of contact/control dating,"I’ve posted here before about the feelings of limerence and obsession I’ve struggled with over someone I’m dating. I like this person a lot and we’ve been seeing each other for about five months, but we haven’t talked about being exclusive or “official” (I need to have this conversation with him at some point; I’m just avoiding it because I’m too afraid of possible rejection).

I have been doing a bit better at letting go of my anxious thoughts throughout the day and focusing on constructive things! On bad mental health days, I am tempted to think obsessively about how the person I’m seeing is probably “over” me, seeing other people, bored of me, etc. Some of this anxiety has intensified lately, because he has not been messaging me as much. When we meet in person, we have nice, long conversations and he expresses interest in spending time with me.

We got coffee today and he mentioned a couple other ideas for things we could do together in the future (seeing a play, etc). It seems clear that he does want to continue spending time with me. He also explained that he’s been trying to spend less time in his phone, which he said is why he hasn’t been as responsive to me on Snapchat.

I felt reassured when he said this, but I also feel like I need to relax into more reduced contact between dates — both because he expressed that he doesn’t want to be on his phone as much, but also because messaging him has been causing me anxiety. I would keep conversations going to enjoy the reassurance that he was still responding to me, but if I was on delivered for more than a few hours, my anxious thoughts became a lot worse. It kind of seems manipulative for me to start conversations to reassure myself, even though I didn’t always realize I was doing it.

I guess what I’d like to do is relax, release control and detach from him a little more for the time being so that I can maintain a handle on my own anxiety. Instead of maintaining banter and small talk over text to quell my own anxiety, I want to give him some space. I also want to enjoy the time we spend together more fully when we do get to see each other, instead of being so hung up on all the “what ifs.”

It’s just so against my own nature to do any of this. Do any APs have advice? I am already fighting the temptation to reach out to him again, but I’m reminding myself that another text exchange will just create anxiety for me.",2,1747103878.0,becomingsecure,0,1.0,False

1klb42z,https://www.reddit.com/r/NCL/comments/1klb42z/review_of_my_encore_alaskan_cruise_as_a_first/,Review of my Encore Alaskan cruise as a first time cruiser,"This was both my fiancés and my first time being on a cruise. Here were our takeaways.

Accommodations: I mentally prepared myself for a cramped space but the room didn't feel small at all! No complaints. The couch and the bed gave us our own separate spaces when resting between activities. I highly recommend the balcony. It was so nice to go outside or open the door for some fresh air whenever we wanted to. I spent hours during the Glacier Bay day reading on the balcony (the observation bay was packed) which was a wonderful and peaceful experience. Probably the best environment I've ever read in. We requested a mattress topper and a coffee maker for our room which were essential imo. 

Excursions: The transportation was terrible. In Ketchikan, they transported us in kids school buses. We couldn't sit normally because the seats were so close together and went over some major potholes on the way back. My fiancé has back issues and this really hurt her for the rest of the day. It was far more jolting than the Galaxy Pavilion rides which had specific warnings for people with back injuries. If I had the knowledge I have now, I would've arranged a shuttle or uber and booked the tickets directly with the lumberjack show to save money. In Skagway, they moved us from a little building designed to give protection from the wind and had us wait in the parking lot for 25 minutes for a late bus. It was incredibly windy and the windchill made it an uncomfortable endurance. Thankfully, we weren't late for the excursion and the bus journey and driver was comfortable and entertaining once it begun. In Juneau, the shuttle line looked to be a 45min-1hr wait so we took an $8 uber instead which was money well spent. 

The excursions themselves were fantastic. The highlight was the White Pass railway. Incredible views and we enjoyed standing outside on the train car through the mountains. Panning for gold and the lumberjack show were both fun.

Food: The specialty restaurants were amazing. We had the More at Sea package which came with 3 specialty restaurants and we ate at Cagney's, Scarpetta and Le Bistro. Being able to order 3 appetizers and 3 desserts EACH for these meals felt extremely generous and most of them were so delicious. We also felt very attended to by the waitstaff. 

The Local was nice for breakfast, as was the buffet. Taste & Savor was decidedly average, never terrible, never great. The kitchen was backed up the second time we dined there and we ended up leaving before dessert because we had to see a show. Not a big deal and that was the only instance we had a wait time. We realized that a significant amount of food on their menus were also available at the buffet and we became buffet diners for our nonspecialty meals after that. I enjoyed the variety and quality of the buffet. 

The drink service was good. They had an interesting variety of bars (mojito, whiskey, wine, brewery, among others).  I rarely had to wait more than a minute to get my drinks and it was nice to be able to get two at a time. 

Cruise Activities: I'm not typically a theater guy but the Choir of Man was an engaging performance. I liked the Beatles band and the casino, although it was interesting how they had to shut it down whenever we went into port. There always seemed to be something going on in the Atrium, which made for a fun hangout whenever there was nothing else to do. The games when they included people from the crowd were entertaining. It was warm enough to sit outside in Spice H2O and people were in the pool during the sail away party. Other than that it was too cold to sit above deck but that's what I expected. 

Disembarkation was smooth. We left our room at 8am, ate at the buffet until they announced we had to leave at 9am and walked off the ship with no line. 

Overall: Great vacation. 8/10. I'm curious to how NCL relates to other cruises and how our experience compares to other's NCL experiences. We went on this trip not really knowing whether we'd be ""cruise people"" but we had a fun time and I think we'll be booking another cruise next year! Any suggestions of where to go or how we could improve our next cruising experience are appreciated!",5,1747103753.0,NCL,2,1.0,False

For reference I'm 24 and she's 21. We talk every once in a while at 
work and she seems really nice. I like her.

 She's in a completely different department from mine. Luckily I'm only working at this location for another month Or so before I go elsewhere. So having to deal with any sort of awkwardness at work won't be an issue

I'd like to ask her out for some coffee during the weekend. But it's very hard to get her alone and not have an audience to do so. I'm only able to speak to her alone on a rare occasion. I'm talking like once a week...

I'd do it in person because it's way better, but I made this note in case I couldn't... it's also easier too. Would it be
 a turn off ? (Note in comments)

I'd probably pass her the note and say something dumb like ""Hey, you dropped this"" and give it to her folded and walk away, lol

Alternatively, I could also ask one of her coworkers if she's single, because I don't even know that to begin with, haha

TL;DR - I like a girl. I'd like to ask her out, but can't because I have little to no alone time with her. Enter the note. Good idea or scrap it ?",1,1747103547.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

It was a beautiful Friday day. We were busy the whole day. 500+ transactions. Cold brews were pouring, espresso shots were remade multiple times before they were served. Ice machine broke down so a coworker walked to a deli to buy all of their ice, iced lattes, iced americanos, iced matches, iced packs. We sold everything including the crumbs from the croissants. 3:55pm and we were done. When all of the sudden a group of Europeans walked inside. Hair slicked back, sunglasses, I thought they worked for Nike since every piece of clothing they were wearing was made by Nike. They each had one of each of what we had already pre-closed. My coworker under his breath cursed in his native language, the atmosphere was tense, I served the drinks and explained they had to enjoy their drinks outside because we close at 4pm. They walked outside and enjoyed the most delicious coffee they ever had along with their cigarettes. 

It was 4:01pm. The record for this particular location for one day’s sale was $4.990, for over a year. I was closing register and my coworker asked. How much was it today? 

I looked at him, then looked at the screen again. This Friday, it was $4.985 and change. I looked at the coffee beans shelf and picked my favorite. A Columbian single origin. I walked towards it and picked up a bag. Punched it in (I left the discount out) charged my card. I looked at my coworker and said. “Today, the owner made $5.008.” He said “Wanna grab a beer after?”

Just want people's opinions on the situation.,"Disclaimer: All people within the story are of legal adult age. My sister was 18 and just graduated at the time. I was 20 and just graduated after being my mother's nurse for 15 years. My brother was 31, helping to fix the house and help pay bills. My father was a 56-year-old at the time, and Jane Doe was 54. My mom had a myriad of health issues before passing. She had stage 5 kidney failure and was on home dialysis, and required me to help her set up her machine at night. As well as assist with med distribution. My father helped with none of that while she was alive. My Sister was just freshly out of high school and just trying to start her life. My brother was recovering from a mental breakdown that almost cost him everything before moving back in with us. My Father was just a dick. 

Backstory: It begins like this;

Our mom passed away on December 18th, 2018, after a long life of health problems. So we all knew Christmas this year was gonna be a shit show. Fast forward to the second week of January, and our family is trying to put together my mom's memorial service. We get most of the details worked out and go about life as one does after the loss of a loved one. As the weeks flow together, we notice that our father is kind of down in the dumps, worse than we had seen before.  This kind of sadness continues for another couple of weeks. February rolls around at this point, we can all collect ourselves enough to start planning the memorial services. We get the details of those set in stone, we decide to have a local memorial for our mom shortly after for our church family and friends. 

A few days, maybe a week or two after the local memorial service, our dad has to go to the bank to settle some accounts and whatnot. My siblings and I, still reeling from the tragedy that took us all by surprise, are at the house when my dad comes home from the bank, happier than we had seen him in weeks. We were almost worried he had a psychotic break at the bank. Now we weren't rich by any means, gracefully low-middle class. So for him to be that happy after such a tragedy, plus to have just gotten back from the bank, was strange. As the little sleuths, my siblings and I began to ask him if everything was okay. He tells us that he made a ""friend"" at the bank that day. He tells us that she is a very nice lady and has also just recently lost her husband. So, as his kids, we were like, well, thank god or whatever higher power was at work that day. Because he has a friend to talk to about grief, and he won't be so hard to manage. Which seems harsh, but it was a rough couple of weeks after Mom had passed. So my siblings and I are happy for him at this point that he has a local friend to talk to. Little did we know that was the worst decision we made. He began to talk to her more and hang out with her like maybe one or two times, for coffee or food. We got through the family memorial we had that March. About a week later, my father says he would like us to meet this new ""friend"". So like the gracious kids we are, we agree cause he still seems happy even though our household was in disarray and our financials were a mess. As his kids, we persevered and agreed to meet with her. For the sake of privacy, we will call her Jane Doe. At this lunch, we all seem to get along, my siblings and I are a little confused by why we are meeting this ""friend,"" Jane Doe. But we are fine with it, about a day or two after meeting her, we realize that they are extremely close to each other, after just a month, after each of their loved ones had passed.

So we go about life as usual and are asked by our father if we can be nice to Mrs. Jane Doe, so she knows that we like her. Well, we think nothing of it at the time and go about life doing our normal things. Till my father had her stay over for the first time, and well, this Jane doe was like a rat you can't get rid of. So she begins to stay with us, aka just move right in. Jane Doe then begins to try and insert herself into mine and my sister's conversations regularly. Even starts to give my brother the creeps. We went on a trip to visit family, and my dad invited her so she could meet my mom's parents. During which she made the entirety of my family uncomfortable with the massive amounts of physical displays of affection. She then tries to befriend my grandparents, who have just lost their oldest daughter. After the trip, she began to almost buy us, or so it seemed. Instead of getting to know us she would just buy us random crap we didn't ask for or want. Before my sister and I (mostly my sister) sit her down and are like, hey, we don't need all this stuff, we need other things like our light bill paid or our water bill paid. We don't need any more useless stuff. Again, we are still being nice at that point. My father then pulls me aside and says I need to start being more appreciative and kinder to her. So, granted, I was not very nice about it, but had already tried the nice thing, so what can I say? I am a little bit of an asshole for this. So my sister, who was genuinely being nice to Jane Doe, tries to explain that I am still processing our mom's death and that it's a little hard on me. So Jane Doe takes this and thinks she needs to start doing more. Well like I said I'm an asshole. So she continues this behavior of inserting herself in conversations and trying to act like she were a 20-something as a 60-year-old. So I fully admit I used her for the free stuff, because she seemed to be the only one who could get our father to pay the bills somewhat on time. So I begin to play like I'm her friend.

One time, my dad and Jane Doe went and picked my sister up from work….. Jane Doe sees a wild animal on her Ring doorbell and decides that my father needs to speed home so she can save her cats. They end up getting pulled over, and Jane Doe gets out of the car and is screaming and walking towards the officers. After not arresting Jane Doe, they agreed to let them go with a warning, leaving my sister traumatized and bewildered. So a little while goes by, it is as far from normal as one can be, but hey. So after a few weeks, my dad decides to rewrite his will and it now includes his new friend and her children to get all of his possessions instead of his children. Meanwhile my siblings and I are just trying to work to keep the lights on while my dad and Jane Doe are gallivanting around West Virginia and Tennessee every weekend. The bills start to pile up, my siblings and I are like What do we do. So we sit down with our dad, and he decides that it's just too much money for him to be going to her house, and that she should just move in. So she moves in, and it only gets worse from there. 

Again, it starts awkward and weird, but we are adults, and it's whatever ever at least the bills are getting paid. My sister starts working a different shift that gets her more money, and my brother is picking up more shifts for the same thing. Well, a few weeks go by, that sharing a room with my sister with different shifts wasn't the best idea. Considering I worked days as a nanny and she worked nights. An My father had moved into Jane doe’s house at that point. Well about a month or two goes by and my father and Jane Doe decided to move back in so they could use her trailer as a “Weekend house”. So I moved out of their old room to the couch in the living room. Well Mrs. Jane Doe then decides to trape across the house like goddamn elephant at 4 am waking the dogs, my siblings and I.  by turning on every light in the dang house. So from there it just seemed to get worse. She then started to complain that we were using their bathroom too much, granted, it was the only working bathroom in the house at that time. Then from there it became well that this was her house too, and blah blah whining to my father. So one night, while my father and Jane Doe were staying at her house for the night. My brother decided to talk with me just to say hey, you gotta try and be nicer to her and be more ""respectful"" of them keeping the peace, kind of thing. So we do it for about a month or two. As the holidays approach, granted its our first holiday season without our mother. My father says he is having Jane Doe join us, and she wants to help. My siblings and I are trying to be supportive, as this is our first holiday season without our mom, to which our father is oblivious. He even brings her with us to the grave site. Talk about awkward.  

We somehow dredged our way through the holidays, and feeling all the feels. We get through December when jane doe decides that it's okay to start changing things around the house. She makes the decision to remove all the pictures of our mom and put up pics of her instead. Including the most awkward family photo ever, my brother wasn't even there and my sister had been cropped out. During this time, my sister and brother are telling me to be nice, be nice, blah blah. So I begin to be ""Nice"", I kindly let my brother and sister know, and go about life as if nothing changed. I Begin to hang out with her again and she is none the wiser that all of the compliments are more sarcastic than Bill Hicks on a good day. She then finds out that my mom had a bunch of health issues and whatnot. So she then brings all of her little health “problems” to me, like her on-call nurse. She then uses that as a gateway to try and be like my mother in the most Coraline way possible. 

 Being that I'm kind of a dick still I tell her all the problems are fine and she will be okay. Even tough I'm not a licensed professional. Well, fast forward to the next few days, she then begins to tell my sister and I on a forced bonding trip. That she is not trying to replace our mom and that we don't have to call her mom. To which my ass unthinkingly says that's fine we never thought you were and that unfortunately that's shoes she could never fill. Well, that seemed to send things into a real bad spiral, cause you're right again it went downhill. She tells my father about it and that my sister was some mastermind of evil, and that she convinced me and my brother to treat her poorly. As well as that I couldn't possibly of said anything or done anything mean to her.  When my sister defends herself, she says “You think that I would come up with that.” she just tried to reassure her that she is being nice and she is trying to stop me from being a dick.  My brother and I both come to her defense and are like, yeah, that's something I would do to someone. I even after I told her that if I'm going out of my way to be ""nice,"" chances are I'm not being nice. So, for some reason, this changes the narrative to now my sister is being rude and that she didn't want Jane Doe in the house, and she was the reason we were broke all the time. (Not the trips every weekend out of state during Covid had anything to do with it or the fact that my literal teenage sister was genuinely being nicer than I ever was..) But anyway, I kept being a dick despite my sisters and brothers best efforts.

After that whole conversation with Jane Doe, I decided my mother's pictures needed to come back out.  I also needed to up my game if she wasn't going to get a clue. So I started to make my comments a little more brutal. My brother got the other bathroom working again, so we weren't in their ""space"" anymore. Which also meant that our laundry room was working again. Which after a period of not having a washer laundry does pile up. Jane Doe took that as a personal attack. So she once again complained/whined and I kid you not literally cried. To my father full temper tantrum style. That we were trying to keep her from doing their laundry to make her look bad. As well as a way to push her away and not “make room” for her in our lives.   So we came up with a laundry schedule that she never could figure out so it was always an issue. I mean, it wasn't our fault she was incapable of human comprehension, right? 

I digress that we were trying our best to get along. Well, by this point, my brother was working so much that his mental health was deteriorating. My sister was too stressed with school and work. On top of being worried about what Jane Doe would say next to try and get her kicked out. So I’ll admit that I used Jane Doe’s deep pockets to fuel my Bad habits. Meanwhile, nobody is worrying about the bills. Once again, as it always does, bills became due, and my dad would take it personally and lash out by screaming/ slamming all the things he could. While putting the blame on my sister and I. cause we haven't been helping enough or making Jane feel welcomed. So he just all together stops paying altogether and just does what he wants with Jane Doe and leaves us to our own devices. They for all sense of the meaning, moved out and I can't stress that enough. We think this is the best thing to have happened in years. Well, we get the bills straightened out and we get all the stuff almost to a good level, I mean no money for groceries, but hey, rice and chicken broth never gets old. My siblings and I handle all the bills as best we can and try to keep food on the table while taking care of my dads dog that my dad had just left behind. 

My sister finally got to go to school. Things were looking up. Well, all good things must come to an end, right? Once again, Jane Doe and our dad move back in and make her house their ""weekend house"". Well of course shit hits the fan once again and my siblings and I are left with a deadline of we have to be moved out by September that year. So we start to freak out wondering; What are we going to do? So we all go about our lives figuring it out. All the while trying to dodge my father and Jane Doe within the house. We get ourselves together and Jane Doe just still isn't satisfied for some unknown reason and decides to try and be mine and my sister's “friend” again while treating us like crap. We have to be ""nice"" and during this time Jane Doe decides to lose all sense of the meaning of boundaries and decides to walk into mine and my sisters room repeatedly unclothed throughout the months of us getting our stuff together to move out. She would also walk around complaining that ""her"" house is a mess. All of us were still trying to keep the lights on in the house and keep what little peace we all had left.  Like clockwork work Jane doe starts up again, and brings my father into it more now. It also mostly seemed geared toward my sister for some unknown reason now. Jane Doe tries to be our ""Friend"" again. Shortly after with the  same stuff different label all over again. We all get out of the twilight zone and begin furthering our lives. Until about a two years later our  father  tried to contact us and be all buddy buddy again. Asking why we don't ever answer Jane Doe or why we never contact them. There are more stories than the ones I highlighted here; these were just the basic rundown of what happened.

1klay85,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1klay85/the_bull_next_door/,The Bull Next Door,"Part One: The New Neighbor

We moved into the cul-de-sac in early spring. Quiet, manicured, suburban—just the kind of neighborhood that lulled weak men into thinking their world was secure. Men like my husband.

He called it “home”.

I called it safe. Sometimes with a smile. Sometimes with a sigh. 

The day the house next door sold, I was rinsing a wineglass in the sink—bored, barefoot, still damp from a lazy shower.

He called me over with the same dull enthusiasm he used for coupons and forecast updates.

“Looks like the new neighbor’s here.”

I padded to the window and sipped what was left in my glass.

Then I saw him.

Tall. Confident. Sleeveless shirt sticking to a body that didn’t just work out—it dominated. He moved like the sun warmed him harder than it touched anyone else.

I lifted my chin, tilted one shoulder back, let my mouth curl around the rim of the glass—and stared.

He moved like he knew people watched him. And I did. Longer than I should’ve.

I let a soft hum slip from the back of my throat. Just enough for my husband to hear.

That was the moment. He wouldn’t admit it, but I know it curled something in his stomach.

“He’s probably some gym rat who plays music too loud,” he muttered, drying his hands like a man clinging to whatever masculinity a dishtowel could offer.

I didn’t respond. Not to him. I whispered instead to the wineglass:

“I hope he plays it really loud.”

—

The first week passed in quiet little rituals. Coffee. Mail. A glance.

I lingered at the window most mornings, pretending to admire the sky while watching something far more interesting.

My robe slipped just low enough for the breeze to do what my husband hadn’t in months—notice my body.

By Wednesday, I’d made up my mind.

No banana bread. I wasn’t some apron-wrapped cliché.

I pulled a bottle of Pinot Noir from the rack and a fresh wine opener from the drawer.

He caught me at the counter, applying lipstick.

“You’re… dressing up?”

I didn’t even glance at him.

“I’m being polite.”

The dress I chose wasn’t fancy. Just honest. Soft cotton. Fitted. The kind of fabric that hugs the truth.

It slipped around my hips like a secret and dipped low enough at the neckline to invite consequence.

“He just moved in,” I added, stepping into heels.

“It’s rude not to say hello.”

I didn’t invite him to come with me. I didn’t need to.

—

Jordan’s house was unassuming from the outside. Inside? Minimal. Confident.

Cool gray walls. Bare floors. A single speaker pulsing low music in the corner, like even his silence had bass.

He answered the door like he’d been expecting me.

Took one look at the bottle in my hand—and then at me. And smiled.

“Perfect timing,” he said, stepping aside.

I walked in without hesitation.

—

He opened the wine one-handed, like it was a reflex.

Poured two glasses and handed me the first without asking how I liked it.

I didn’t need to be asked.

I took it and leaned one hip against the counter, watching him move—quiet, slow, unbothered.

His presence didn’t fill the space. It claimed it.

He poured his own and let the silence stretch.

It wasn’t awkward. It was curated.

He let me be the first to speak.

“Settling in okay?”

He nodded once. “Yeah. These houses are close. Good views.”

I raised my brow. “That a complaint or a compliment?”

He sipped. “Haven’t decided yet.”

—

We stood there longer than polite.

The wine was dry and dark. The air warmer now.

Rocket circled once, then dropped near my feet like he’d chosen a side.

Jordan stayed exactly where he was. Watching me with that calm, unfazed attention. Like he already knew the difference between company and opportunity.

And I let him.

I swirled the wine in my glass, tilted it toward him.

“Next time I’ll bring something better.”

His voice didn’t lift.

“Next time, you don’t bring anything but time.”

That’s when I smiled.

That’s when I knew.

—

I didn’t rush leaving. But I left on my own terms.

And when I closed his door behind me, I didn’t just feel watched.

I felt remembered.



Part Two: The Cracked Door

That night, I went to bed early. No kiss. No soft goodnight.

I left my phone in the kitchen—and my vibrator on the nightstand.

The door stayed cracked. Just enough.

Not for airflow. For effect.

I made no effort to muffle the sound. Not the click as I turned it on. Not the moan I let slip three minutes later—low, breathy, just loud enough to carry through drywall.

I even let the sheets rustle. Rhythmically. Recklessly.

He could hear every pulse of it from the couch—the steady hum, the breathless shudder, the silence that followed.

I didn’t say his name.

I didn’t say any name.

But in the dark, I smiled.

Because he’d spend the rest of the night wondering:

Was I thinking about Jordan…

or just making sure he heard what wanting sounds like?

Either way, he didn’t sleep.

—

Saturday gave us sunshine—bright enough for short tempers and shorter fabrics.

I made a little show of stretching at the sink, then casually mentioned wanting some color.

He perked up, hopeful, like that meant togetherness.

Sweet.

I disappeared into the bedroom and emerged in my black one-piece.

Plunging in the back, high at the hips, unapologetic.

Paired with oversized sunglasses and a slow walk to the yard, I didn’t need sunscreen.

I was the heat.

He followed like a trained pet, carrying a folding chair and a pitcher of lemon water like that counted for something.

I picked the lawn spot closest to the fence.

Jordan was outside. Shirtless. Predictably.

Rocket barked once and trotted circles around him like even the dog knew where power lived.

I waved. Jordan waved back.

My husband didn’t.

I laid out on my stomach, adjusting my straps with just enough intention. My back arched, my skin caught the sun, and if I looked posed—good. I was.

I stayed there long enough to feel him watching.

Not Jordan.

The one behind me, pretending not to notice how much of me he’d stopped being allowed to touch.

After twenty minutes, I sat up—slow, deliberate—and stretched. Arms overhead, hips angled. The kind of movement that says admire me, without asking.

Jordan noticed.

He looked up from Rocket’s water bowl, eyes trailing my frame without apology.

“You always stretch like that when someone’s watching?” he called out, amused.

I let the strap slip just enough to tease the curve of my shoulder.

“Only when it’s someone worth watching back.”

He smirked. “Good to know.”

We didn’t need more words. That wasn’t a conversation.

It was an agreement.

My husband sat behind me somewhere, trying not to react. Trying to pretend he still had a place in this story.

But my body radiated more than sunlight.

And the silence beside me?

It wilted in comparison.



Part Three: The First Knock

I waited until nightfall to push things further—not with words, but with footsteps.

He went to the guest room first. That’s where he sleeps now. I never told him to leave the master bedroom—he just did. The silence had already said enough.

I gave him twenty minutes to pretend he had privacy. Then I found him in the laundry room, folding one of my silk camisoles with a kind of reverence he used to save for anniversaries. Good. He was soft. Ready.

“I want you to prepare the bedroom.”

He turned slowly, like he already knew what I meant. I didn’t explain. I didn’t repeat Myself.

I placed the linen spray in his hands. The expensive one with the black matte label and gold cap—the one he knows better than to touch. Then I handed him a folded pair of briefs. Not his. Black. Smooth. Jordan’s size.

“Lay these at the foot of the bed. Neatly.”

Then came the final detail. I dabbed perfume at My wrists, then extended the bottle toward him.

“One spritz. On My pillow only. Don’t waste it.”

He nodded, eyes low. And I turned, pausing only once in the doorway.

“No sitting on the bed,” I said without looking back. “That space isn’t for you.”

—

He smoothed the sheets like they mattered. Fluffed the pillows like they were sacred. Placed the briefs like an offering. The perfume hit last—sharp, floral, unforgettable. The scent that would cling to Me later like proof.

I know he lingered after, breathing it in. Staring at the bed. Wishing.

He left the door cracked. Not out of indecision.

Out of hope.

—

Then, at 9:12, the doorbell rang. My lips curled. Jordan was prompt.

I passed the cuck in the hallway. He didn’t speak. He didn’t move.

I wore black. Not lingerie. Not modesty. A robe that barely covered what I’d already decided to give.

I opened the door. Jordan stood there, calm, tall, already halfway inside Me with just a look.

“Evening,” he said, eyes trailing low before they rose again.

I stepped back without a word and let him follow. Down the hallway. Past the cuck.

Two sets of footsteps. One soft. One heavier. Real.

The door closed behind us.

—

I stood at the foot of the bed and let the robe fall—not for Jordan’s benefit, but for the ritual. For the stillness between breath and surrender. For the man who would hear it and know he wasn’t welcome.

Then Jordan’s voice.

Low. Calm. Certain.

“Don’t look away. Watch what we do to each other.”

—

He waited outside the bedroom door, spine pressed to the wall, hands flat to the floor like he could absorb something through it. I hadn’t told him to kneel. But I hadn’t given him permission to leave either. And he understood enough now to treat My silence like a rule.

—

The first sound wasn’t speech. It was motion.

The bed shifting.

Skin against skin.

A slap—firm, not cruel. A reminder that I was alive and being worshipped in the most delicious, carnal way.

I laughed. Not loudly—just honest. That soft, unguarded sound you make when someone else is listening and you want them to suffer for it.

Jordan’s voice again, closer this time:

“On your stomach.”

I didn’t tease. I didn’t test. I moved, and Jordan moved with Me.

The pace shifted—deeper, faster. Gasps turned to moans, moans into something rawer. There was no pretending now. Just rhythm. Sweat. Truth.

Jordan didn’t take. He met Me—push for push, breath for breath. Every sound we made was earned. Created. Mutual.

I pressed My face into the pillow. The one the cuck had prepared. The one he’d misted with linen spray, hands trembling, thinking he was honoring Me.

And I said it clearly—intentionally—so the hallway would catch it.

“He’s outside.”

Jordan chuckled—not cruel, just knowing. “Good.”

Another thrust. Sharper now. A breath stolen from My mouth.

And then I said it again, louder:

“He needs to hear it.”



Part Four: The Obedience Ritual

When it was over, Jordan kissed Me once—slow, warm, final.

Then he stood. Reached for his jeans. I reached for his shirt.

We dressed without speaking. Not rushed. Just… knowing.

He smiled as I slipped it on. Loose. Still warm. Still his.

“Looks better on you,” he murmured, voice thick with satisfaction.

He grabbed My hips. Held Me there for a second. Like a man reluctant to leave something he’d just ruined beautifully.

Then we walked together. Toward the door.

He opened it. Slowly. Deliberately.

And there he was.

Still kneeling.

Still waiting.

Jordan didn’t step around him. Neither did I.

We stepped over him.

Both of us.

Like he was furniture. Forgotten. Decorative.

Jordan chuckled under his breath as we moved past. I didn’t look down.

He walked ahead to the front door. I followed.

The door clicked behind him.

And I let the silence stretch.

Then I walked to the kitchen.

Poured a glass of water.

Sipped.

And called out, smooth as silk:

“Come.”

—

He rose too fast, stumbled into movement, and followed.

He stopped in the doorway like he wasn’t sure he was allowed past the frame.

Good. Let him question everything.

I didn’t look at him until I was done drinking. Then I set the glass down and pointed down the hall.

“You’ll fix the bed now.”

I walked first. He followed.

The bedroom smelled like sex and my perfume. The sheets were twisted. A condom wrapper still lay beside the nightstand.

He stopped. I didn’t. I let him take it in.

I pointed again.

“Fix it.”

He moved quickly and removed the bedding. Fluffed the pillows. Picked up the wrapper like it might burn him and dropped it in the trash without a word.

When he reached for the laundry basket, I stopped him.

“Leave the sheets.”

My voice was steady. Controlled.

“I like the way he smells.”

—

I stepped closer. Not for kindness—for control. I let him feel my heat, let him smell everything on me that wasn’t his.

Then I touched his cheek with one finger. Just enough pressure to brand.

“You did well tonight.”

That was all he got. That was enough.

I turned away, barefoot and unhurried, still glowing with everything Jordan left behind. The bathroom door closed gently behind Me—not slammed, not locked, just sealed with intention.



Part Five: The Ring

He was alone now.

In the room he had prepared but would never claim. Surrounded by scent. By tangled sheets. By the echo of something he would never be part of.

Still holding the linens. Still waiting for permission he knew wouldn’t come.

For a moment, he looked down at the bed—the mess he hadn’t made. The proof he wasn’t welcome in this part of My story.

Then he saw it.

On the nightstand.

Not a note. Not a keepsake.

His wedding ring.

Polished and gleaming, resting atop a pale pink Post-it with a single word written in My hand:

Watch.

He froze. Then lowered the sheets to the edge of the bed, folding them with care as if that might soften what came next. His fingers hovered above the ring, cautious. Almost reverent.

He picked it up.

Held it.

Let the metal rest in his palm like a verdict.

I had taken it from him weeks ago. Told him it no longer fit. That it didn’t suit the dynamic we were becoming. He hadn’t argued. Not with words. Just silence—the obedient kind that waits to be repurposed.

Now the ring was back.

Not to return what he lost, but to define what he was.

Watch wasn’t a gesture. It was a rule. A mark. A quiet, inescapable order that changed everything without raising My voice.

He slipped it on.

It still fit—perfectly.

And that was the moment he understood.

He wasn’t being pushed out.

He was being positioned.

Not as a husband. Not as a partner.

As a witness.

To My pleasure. To My choices. To the man I welcomed into My bed while he knelt on the other side of the door, listening, aching, forgotten by everyone except Me.

He would wear the ring again.

Because I said so.

Because it meant something now.

When I returned—fresh from the shower, skin warm, My pulse still slowed from control—he was exactly where I expected him.

Standing still.

Eyes fixed on the nightstand.

Fingertips grazing the edge of the Post-it like it might explain something.

Hard.

I didn’t acknowledge him.

Didn’t pause.

I walked past him slowly, and let the smile bloom only after I passed.",2,1747103240.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

1klawed,https://i.redd.it/mlez7k8gmg0f1.jpeg,Scaled Meal Prep + Complements,"Hi everyone! So I don’t do all of my meal prep all at once. Instead, I’ll typically do some significant prep a couple days a week, and the results will feed the freezer as well as set me up for that week. Case in point here! You’re seeing three days of breakfast with those strawberry overnight oat+chia pudding, at this point I eyeball the recipe and just try to track that I won’t abuse the quantities with my coffee serving spoon. For the rest of the week’s breakfasts, I will pull one of my homemade McMuffins, or today I warmed up a thawed bagel and ate it with cream cheese and avocado. 
In the weekend I made a batch of croquetas for a birthday party (recipe in Spanish but you can dump it on Google Translate: https://www.petitchef.es/recetas/entrante/croquetas-de-pollo-y-champinones-fid-1513294). Some of them went to the freezer, and that bag you’re seeing in my collage picture? There were two of them with the surplus chicken breasts I’d bought, shredded for future sandwiches, salads, bowls etc. Super easy: sear on the pan, then dump in a pot with broth, S&P and boil for some 15-20 mins. I will cut them in pieces and my string chopper takes care of the rest (amazing kitchen gadget omg). Which, speaking of gimmicks, get yourself a corn chucker. Mine arrived yesterday and the lone cob of corn I’d bought will now stretch for a couple salads/healthy meals this week, for instance with one of those marinaded beef bags you’re seeing. A large tray of 400 gr was on sale for $6.81 at my usual supermarket, so most of it went to the freezer. Marinades were just my choice of three spices (skewers blend, Cajun and ras-el-hanout) with lemon juice, salt, EVOO and for the ras one, yoghurt. They will do their thing when the meat thaws!
Now for the vegetable situation. I ordered one kg sweet snap peas and 500 gr asparagus for real cheap online ($3.95) and though they took some time to shell and prep, now they’re there! Along with some mint, onion, radish and bell pepper from last week, they made for some great veg stir fry that I paired with some lentil pappardelle I found in my dry pantry. Add taters with either chicken meatballs or (not pictured) salmon (both from previous meal prep in the freezer) and I am set for two meals! Salmon I marinated with fish masala and coconut milk, just eyeballed. Chicken meatballs recipe I took from some instagrammer, sorry! 
Dinners are always made at home fresh, but that doesn’t mean that there isn’t some thinking involved. Take that eel and the tuna, for instance. Both bought online in advance for $9.64; when my order arrived I wasn’t home and so in the evening I found that the eel and one of my tuna fillets were partially thawed. No biggie! Eel made for dinner yesterday with a bag of salad greens, and tuna will be prepped tonight in a cinch for another meal this week, while the other fillet stays in the freezer. What do I have there right now? Pesto…bolognese…some bread…butter chicken…all of what I mentioned above…roasted chicken with veg…and I am probably forgetting something. 
Congrats if you read all this haha. It’s a bit chaotic but here’s how I eat a wide variety of foods weekly, always having a backup in my fridge and without breaking the bank (I wouldn’t say “for cheap” because groceries just aren’t cheap, but the maths always beat eating out properly). This is all for one though my partner will sometimes sit to the table too. 💖 Hope it gives you some inspiration and feel free to ask!",2,1747103084.0,MealPrepSunday,0,1.0,False

In my desperation I only hope my recollection is accurate and true, and not just some fevered dream…

A bit over a week ago I found myself perusing a website, nothing special - mainly technology at a discounted price due to various reasons and imperfections. 
I found a peculiar item that drew my attention - a bone box with ornate trim. I know what you’re thinking; ‘What’s that got to do with technology?’
Really good question, and exactly the question that went through my mind as I looked through the listing photos that were attached.
The box piqued my curiosity, yet I had no idea what it was meant to be. It looked to be composed of two pieces of bone, with what I could only guess was pearl inlaid in a triangular pattern atop one of the halves. No angles gave clue to hinges or anything similar, and I figured that perhaps it was likely something akin to cranial sutures.

I can’t say exactly why, but I just had to have it. I like oddities and the such; and this was a piece that I would really like to add to my collection. 

As I made my way through the webpage I looked for as much information as possible, and I was left wanting in each step of the purchasing process… 
The item in question was only twenty dollars - cheap as, considering how unique its design was. A little off-putting, although only in hindsight. In the moment I found this more exciting than anything.
The seller had no information pertaining to who they were or where the item was located. Even more off-putting - an immediate red flag.
The seller in question had ‘only three remaining’, and at the time I figured that perhaps they had a few of these and each was slightly different in design. 
The final page before purchasing gave me a hearty chuckle, I’m not afraid to admit. It read as follows:

Tomorrow: FREE one-day delivery.
1-7 days: FREE Skinwalker delivery.

Initially I paused, confused, as to what it meant. After a quick search online, my afore mentioned hearty chuckle started - “A creature of Native American legend” was the search result. I laughed audibly for a few minutes I believe. The creature in question is an interesting read, and labelled as exactly that - legend.

I honestly don’t know what I expected when I selected the Skinwalker option: but who would select anything but when making an online purchase? Figuring it was nothing more than a hilarious joke, and that it would more-than-likely just be the exact same shipping option - that was the option I opted for with a cheesy grin and an overly excited click of the mouse.

Tuesday morning, I heard a knock at the door. Enthusiastically I answered the door with a cheery “Hello”, expecting my unique item to have arrived, only to find no one standing there. Looking up and down the street I couldn’t see anyone, just the usual few cars that lined the street and a neighbour’s cat that was staring at me from under one of said cars. 
Wondering if it was a knock and run, I turned back and walked inside. The likely-hood of a knock and run was minimal being a Tuesday morning. I remember thinking, ‘the kids were at school and the other adults were at work’. Having a weird roster has its perks - Tuesday and Wednesday off each week gives a better chance to get to any shops without having to fight time, although it can prove lonely with seemingly everyone else on a different rotation.

Walking back to my arm-chair, I took a seat and continued doom-scrolling inane crap as I tend to do. 

Maybe twenty minutes had passed, and I found myself laughing away to some reel or another. 
My ‘joy’ was interrupted by another rapping on my front door. Sitting my phone on my side table, I made my way to the door laughing most of the way.
I spoke through the door as I opened it, offering a meager apology to the delivery guy,
“ Hello. Sorry, mate, I was-” my apology was stopped midway as again I found an empty porch. This time I gingerly made my way down the few porch steps and examined both sides of my old house, then up and down the street, expecting to find a truant child perhaps, looking for a thrill while everyone else was at school. 

Nothing.

A long moment passed as I internally questioned whether I had actually heard the knocking… trying to consider things through multiple lenses, I came to the conclusion that the street was too still to have misinterpreted other noises as knocking, but had nothing else to fall back on.

I decided that I’d sit on the steps and wait for my mystery knocker to return for round three.

The next hour passed like a meandering turtle. Not a soul walked the street in that time and I found myself getting over the waiting game quite quickly. The only form of anything that could be considered close to entertaining was watching the neighbours cat sitting underneath the car and pondering what it’s life entailed. Even that grew stale quickly as the cat appeared interested in naught but staring at me. Maybe it was sitting there wondering what my life entailed, just as I wondered about its. 
As I stood to make my way inside once more, the only car to make it’s way down the street that I had seen or heard all morning turned into my street and slowly accelerated. I remember turning and paying attention to it, an old cream thing with soft lines. Perhaps vintage - although I wouldn’t know enough to know whether it could have actually been a vintage model or not. 
The warm sun shone down from the heavens and the immaculate car’s surface reflected the every ray of the sun’s light across my neighbours houses like a flashlight shining betwixt the panelling of a picket fence as it passed by. 
The hairs on my neck stood to attention as the car made it’s way past my house - the inexorable reflection danced across the cat and it’s eyes reflected the light back toward me, not the usual sickly yellow of a cat utilising the lowlight for visual advantage, but rather a vibrant red that felt as if it eyes bore into my very being.

The sudden shift gave me a start and I’m not too ashamed to admit I jumped just a little bit... I figure either the car passing or me jumping must have startled the cat as it was gone by the time the car had passed.

Holding my hand to my chest, I started to chuckle again with a bowed head before turning back inside with an embarrassed smile, softly shutting the door behind me.

Some time after lunch as I sat straddled upon the porcelain throne; reading news updates, checking the freshest memes - the usual time-fillers as I performed my daily ritual. I was drawn from my phone, however, by a sudden and sharp scratching from above me. My gaze diverted to the empty patch of ceiling above me immediately as I sat there motionless. 
“Rats?” I softly spoke to myself, puzzled. Although I don’t remember ever hearing the sound previous, that doesn’t exactly equate to no chance there’s a rat or rats now. Even though the sound only lasted a few seconds before stopping and not returning, it left me in a state that I can only describe as uncertain... like a state of anxiety I guess.

As I pulled my draws up, I heard the unmistakable knocking from my front door once more. 
Standing there with my pants halfway up, frozen, I contemplated not even answering the door and instead waiting for the ‘we missed you’ slip and just picking it up myself. 
An ingenious thought crossed my mind, if I do say so myself - exit through the back door and stealthily make my way around front to catch whoever was there. Ingenious.

As quietly as I could, I unlatched the deadbolt and gently opened the back door - no creaks to give my plans away. Poking my head out first, I meticulously scanned my back yard. No one - off to a solid start.
Softly closing the door behind me, each step forward made my pulse quicken. I suppose the unknown has a way of messing with us in ways, hence our fervent search for knowledge at each step of every turn.
Rounding the side of my house, I set sight on my side fence and I could feel my face become deadpan - my stealth mission was immediately hindered by the fence and accompanying gate that squeaked more than a church-mouse choir.

I’m still not entirely sure what made me think this was the best course of action, but I took a running start in an attempt to clear the fence in a graceful straddle. What ensued however, was polar opposite: my hip/guts hit the fence with a sickening thud, and I let out an ‘Oof’ sound with the wind driven from my body, I then tumbled over the fence to the front side with a second ‘Oof’ as the remaining wind was driven from my body upon forced contact with the ground.
“…Fuck…” my words were strained and probably through reflex more so than any practical thoughts. I don’t know how long I was laying there trying to gather myself before I remembered what I was even doing, getting up as quickly as my battered body would allow, I poked my head around the corner like a curious child.
Nothing.
Again, no one was anywhere near the vicinity. Although in hindsight, if someone was there, my full-body ballet would probably have sent the most battle-hardened fleeing in terror… probably not, but it helps my fractured ego a little bit after falling over my own fence and driving the wind from my body twice in a single bound…

With a limp I made my way to the street to see if anyone was around, partially to see if the potential culprit was anywhere to be seen, and partially to see if anyone saw my fence molest me with a suplex out the side of my house.

What did catch my attention however, was a patchwork weaving of sticks and bones that was affixed to my mailbox and lightly swinging in the breeze. I had never seen such a thing before in my life. 
Made from three sticks tied with some type of fibres, perhaps strands of hair, around the corners to form a triangle with three bones and an uncut stone suspended inside the arrangement by the same fibrous bindings.
I would be lying if I said I was anything but petrified in that moment, although I couldn’t have explained why at the time. 
Many minutes must have passed as I stood there staring at the precarious trinket attached to my mailbox. Eventually I mustered the courage to grab it, slowly. 
It was cold to the touch, abnormally cold, even before adding in the beaming sun’s rays to the equation. 
In a panic I ripped the unfathomable trinket from my belongings and tossed it haphazardly into the street with a sneer before quickly moving inside and bolting the door shut and sliding down the door, back pressed firmly, until I sat there pressed up against the barrier to the outside world. Curling my legs up to my chest I remained there, scared. Scared of what? I wouldn’t have been able to articulate the thoughts, even if given more than ample opportunity. All I knew was either something was really wrong, or someone was playing a prank on me worthy of a world record title.

Not a minute had passed when I was jerked from my racing thoughts by a loud knock imminently behind me. Moving to my feet with such a speed I wouldn’t have been surprised if I had torn myself from my skin and left it in a wet coil where I once sat.
I stood there, motionless, staring at the only obstacle between myself and the knocking.
“Wh- who-” my voice all but faded, I cleared my throat and tried again, “Who’s there? This isn’t funny, man.” Although as steady as I could hold, my voice wavered like slack fishing line in the wind.

Nothing.

I could feel tears welling in my eyes as I closed them, hoping against all that this would just stop. Just go away. 

Again the knocking came, this time louder, more forceful than before, then a soft woman’s voice followed,
“Is that you, Steven?” the voice was off-putting, at first I thought it was one of my neighbours, Mai, but her voice was… different. Like it didn’t have any pitch variation at all, just monotone and flat.
“Mai? Mai is that you?” I called through the door, abject terror parting momentarily.
“Is that you?” her voice still sounded weird, but it sounded like Mai nonetheless,
“Mai!” I exclaimed, unlocking and throwing the door open, “You won’t beli-” I started to speak with returning clarity before stopping dead. 
In the doorway did not stand Mai, but rather a small bone box inlaid with pearl rest on my doormat…
I remember an energy running the entirety of my body in that moment - an energy unlike any I had ever experienced previously. Every piece of me begun to shake and wobble violently - after some thought I’m likely to believe that perhaps my body was flooded with adrenaline or what-have-you and that was my bodies ‘fight or flight’ response kicking in. 
In a sick irony however, I felt utterly unable to do either, and instead stood there like a cow in the headlights. My legs gave way after what was probably closer to seconds but felt like an eternity as I collapsed to the floor, jarring me from the mental coffin I subconsciously found myself imprisoned in. 
Scurrying to my feet and slamming the door closed followed by the bolt and the regular lock in as quicker motion as I could muster, I then braced myself against the door, shoulder first, with my legs locked firmly behind me. 
Every breath came more rapid than the last and it felt as if my chest would burst at any moment as I could feel my hot breathe dispersed by the wooden barricade reflected back against my face.

Scratching from the walls broke my concentration on my front door, the source however, was an enigma - feeling as if the direction rotated with my perception in an attempt to confuse me, I stood motionless staring about the room in rising confusion.

All sense of normality had left my body: anxiety fueled my every thought and uncertainty gave rise to abject terror - something was horribly wrong, every ounce of my being screamed it at me, to run: run like my life depended on it.

Chicken-skin struck as the hairs on my neck stood on end at my sudden realisation: The back door! In my haste to see who was outside my front door, I had forgotten to secure the back door…

Creeping around as if I was walking on proverbial egg-shells, my pulse driving any other sensation from my ears, I rounded my head from the hallway and eyed the back door - both the wooden door and the gauss door swung open with reckless abandon. I still feel as if I could drop dead on the spot whenever I think back to that scene… the barricades to my abode had proven as useful as wrist-bands at an orgy, and I stood motionless for more than I care to remember, awaiting my life to end at any moment.

The sound of metal being ripped asunder spurned me from my motionless gaze, it had sounded as if it came from next door - “Mai!” I exclaimed, control returning to me in an instant. Perhaps Mai and I didn’t know each other very well, but her and Steven were very nice people, and if whatever plagued me on this day had set it’s sights on her: I had to try and help her in some way. I would want help if the shoes were reversed…

Stopping only to slide a butcher’s cleaver from the drawer, I bolted out the front door with startling efficiency - held only momentarily by my attempts at security. Amazingly I had the presence of mind to slide the butcher’s utensil into the side of my trousers before exiting my doorway. If anyone would have seen me sprinting next door wielding a large knife, the cops would have been here in an instant. I kind of wish I had now; at least law enforcement may have been there, and maybe they would have seen what I saw…

Only when I replay the events of that day in my mind do I recall seeing the strange bauble affixed to my letter-box once more, the same hideous bauble I flung away with disdain not twenty minutes prior. At the time I did not hesitate in my strides to take note of such things - although I wish more than anything that I had.

Exclaiming, “Mai!” I pounded on the door with inexorable fury, desperate for an answer and swimming in adrenaline - naught.
Finding it hard to believe that noone would have heard my thunderous knocks I took a step back and charged her front door shoulder-first.
The jam stood firm and I bounced like a pigeon on a windshield - and it fucking hurt. Momentarily I dropped my arm limp, agony aflush throughout my system - a welcome reprieve from an endless onslaught of panic.
Subduing the pain I repositioned myself and laid by boot into the door-lock with all my weight. Again and again I drove myself into the stationary obstacle that defied me. After the fourth or fifth kick the door-jam splintered and the door gave way, echoing the abrupt sound throughout the house.

A wave of cold air hit me harder than a prime-mover hitting a deer on the freeway. 

As if on auto-pilot I immediately flung myself inside without a moment’s thought, stopped only by my bodies sudden reaction to the climatic change. I felt every muscle start to tighten one after another, beginning in my legs, and each breath became enigmatically visible - how could the temperature shift from a warm, spring day outside to such a frigid and incompatible climate?  And seemingly as soon as one stepped over the threshold inside.

Immediately aware of the choices I had made, yet resolved to continue forward for Mai’s sake, I gingerly took my first step since regaining control over my bodily functions.

Initially, Mai’s house looked as I had expected it - bar lights off where one would have thought they would be on if someone was home. I called out to her again,
“Mai! Mai, are you home?! It’s Allan! Mai, are you okay?!”
Nothing… not a shred of sound emanated from within her house.
Determined to find Mai I continued forth warily.

The lounge room: everything was neat and tidy. A good sign to her wellbeing I had thought at the time, but honestly - my house hadn’t been ransacked and I was scared out of my mind. Any attempt at regaining my composure was swiftly met at the guillotine as I eyed a small white box on her coffee table - a box made of bone and inlaid in pearl. Any chance I had at feeling in that moment was dwarfed when the same sound of metal being torn asunder assailed my hearing - my eyes moved underfoot to the vibrating floorboards I stood upon. Whatever that sound was, it was coming from underfoot; from underneath the house.

All hope I had desperately clung to was ripped from me like a pacifier from a newborn as I turned tail only to be met face to face with Mai.

I think I almost shit myself when I turned and found her there, staring blankly at me. I can’t blame her - her neighbour had just broken into her house and as far as she may have been concerned: I was there only for nefarious reasons.

“I’m sorry, Mai, you didn’t answer your door and I was so worried-”

Mai didn’t flinch.

“I’ve had the weirdest fucking day and I was worried about you guys-”

In my embarrassed state I minced over my words in a futile attempt to get Mai to understand me, but she seemingly didn’t care for a word that came from my mouth.

“Mai? Mai, are you listening?”

Mai continued to stare at me, or more, seemed to stare through me. I took a laboured step toward Mai as I raised my hand to gently place on her shoulder, feeling she may have been experiencing similar to what I had, stating softly,
“Mai, where’d you get that box?..”
Her attention shifted as her eyes focused on mine, suddenly aware of my presence,
“I thought you were at work.” Mai spoke, more a combination of words strung together than a coherent sentence,
“Huh?” the question had caught me off-guard, “I don’t work Tuesdays or Wednesdays… Mai? Are you okay?”
“Steven? Is that you?”
Her words made my skin crawl… something about her demeanour was very off to the Mai I infrequently spoke to,
“Mai. We need to go. Now.” I grabbed her wrist as I started back toward her front door, immediately thrown by how cold her skin was, and how loose… the skin about her wrist twisted like it wasn’t actually attached underneath - not unlike that saggy, granny-skin grandmas tend to get under their necks and about their arms.
“What the-” I let go almost immediately and turned back to Mai, “You’re so cold, come, lets get you out of here…”

No sooner than I had uttered the sentence, did I feel a warm, sharp sensation light up my back like a flare in the night. Wincing and stumbling as I turned back to Mai, only then did I notice her eyes in the lowlight of the small room - dull black orbs that absorbed any rays of light shining through the broken doorway that would so much as grace her face. 
“Steven? I thought you were rats?” her voice changed when she spoke the word rats: it sounded wholly different. She sounded like me…

“Mai?-” I choked out as my feet fumbled with every reverse step, “Mai? Are you okay?..” my voice little more than a light rasp.

Her sunken gaze never let me, standing completely still as I inched my way from inside her house.

Only when I had exited her house in full did I turn to run, to be met by law enforcement with firearms drawn and concentrated on me,
“Freeze! Hands up and get on the ground!”
I hadn’t heard a sound other than Mai and my own heartbeat, and their timing leaves me with many questions in hindsight. Honestly in that moment I was glad, I was glad to be met by another human-being on the front lawn. I was even glad to be taken in the back of the Pig-Mobile - at least I wasn’t alone.

Everything from that moment onward seemed rushed, or perhaps passed me by in a flash. Doctors all say the latter due to trauma of some kind; hence my ‘near-instantaneous mental decline’.

I was arrested and charged with Break & Enter, Possession of a Deadly Weapon, Criminal Trespass, Menacing Behaviour and Criminal Mischief… my lawyer argued for insanity, against my wishes, and ultimately that’s what was decided - I was declared Guilty by reason of Insanity.

The Doctor’s won’t listen to a thing I’ve had to say and have declared that I would be a danger to myself if let free and unmedicated. No so much a danger that I’m not allowed a few comforts such as pencils and paper; but allegedly enough of a danger that I can’t see myself outside these walls any time soon.

The skittering noise in the roof started only a few days after my arrival, although noone else admits to hearing it - it’s here. It’s always here…

This morning I could hear soft mumbling from the other side of my cell. Pressing my ear against the soft, padded wall, I focused intently - genuine interactions with someone outside the orderly can prove few and far between. 
I could only make out the last few sentences,
“Allan! Allan, are you home?! It’s Allan! Allan, are you okay?! You’re so cold, come, lets get you out of here…”

1klauv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/asadsisters/comments/1klauv3/amandas_dangerous_lies/,Amanda's dangerous lies.,"Amanda's most recent post about only having pregnancy cravings for lemon water reminded me of something very important and very serious. 

Remember the ""suhoor wars"" between the sisters (and Marah) during Ramadan where every day, in every vlog, IG story, and TikTok post, they were all in competition with each other over who could eat the least for suhoor? They all started off by just having coffee, then just water and a date, then just water, and by the end of Ramadan they were all skipping suhoor entirely. 

Their comment sections were full of their naïve, ""fatty"" and ""oppressed Muslim girl"" followers who were telling the Asads how they wouldn't be able to survive their work/school day without eating a filling suhoor. Thus, the Asads got to feel like skinny white princesses who were better at calorie restriction than the ""sweaty Arabs"" they make their money from. 

But. 

We just found out from Amanda herself that she was pretending to fast all of Ramadan. She didn't fast a single day and was just putting on a show for her followers so that they wouldn't suspect anything. 

That means that every. single. time. Amanda got on social media and said ""youuu guiiiiiiiseeeeee, I'm just not hungryyyyyy for suhooooooor, I just want water otherwise I'll get bloaaaaaaated......you guyyyyyyyse, I just don't even want suhooor right nowwwwwwwwww"" she wasn't actually fasting. But all of the young girls who followed her believed that she was, and felt bad that they needed to have some eggs or a protein shake or something in the morning in order to be able to function at their job or study for tests at school. 

Meanwhile, lying snake Amanda was pretending to be oh so skinny and oh so ED that she didn't need suhoor, all the while she wasn't even fasting as she sat on her ass at home filming TikToks for a living.

When you look at Tamil TV serials these days, does anyone else feel like we're stuck in a time loop? It feels like 90% of them revolve around the same maamiyar-marumagal (mother-in-law vs daughter-in-law) conflicts, endless family conspiracies, and plotlines stretched thinner than a cheap dosa. Weeping levels are always at maximum, misunderstandings last for months, and villains twirl their metaphorical moustaches with zero subtlety.


Seriously, where did the creativity go? Compared to the experimentation happening in films (sometimes!) or even web series, the serial landscape often feels stagnant, churning out variations of the same theme decade after decade.


So, what's the actual deal here?


 * Is it purely a TRP game, sticking to 'safe' formulas that guarantee ratings from a specific demographic?


 * Is it lazy writing and risk-averse production houses?


 * Do audiences genuinely prefer these storylines, or is it just what they're constantly fed?


 * Are there any hidden gems or recent serials that actually tried something different and succeeded (or failed spectacularly)?


Genuinely curious to hear your thoughts, theories, frustrations, or even defences. Why does it feel like Tamil serials are creatively lagging behind?

The Iridocyclitis Theory: The Iridocyclitis Theory posits that all things matter, thought, time, and consciousness are fundamentally one entity, fragmented through illusion. It suggests that the universe is not made of separate parts but is a single, living organism experiencing itself through countless forms, like cells in a body, each believing it's independent. According to the theory, your thoughts are not truly yours they are echoes of thoughts from others across time and space. When you look at someone, you’re looking at another version of yourself through a different lens. Even objects are not inanimate; they are frozen expressions of consciousness vibrating at slower frequencies. Dreams, déjà vu, synchronicities these are glitches or overlaps where the illusion breaks and the deeper connection peeks through. The term ""Iridocyclitis,"" originally a medical condition involving the eye, is symbolic: the eye represents perception, and the inflammation represents the disruption of false perception. The theory claims that once we “inflame” our perception, challenge it, we begin to see the truth: that reality is a network of mirrors. Nothing is truly external; everything is a projection of the same source trying to understand itself. The creators of this interconnected web? Not gods or aliens, but us an ancient version of ourselves that designed this reality as a test, a loop, or maybe a game to remember what we are: not bodies, not names, but the connection itself.”

If I still have your attention, here is more to us.

Why do we exist? -We exist because the One (the original consciousness, the Source, the Everything) got bored of being everything and nothing at the same time. Imagine being in a room with infinite mirrors and no one to talk to so the One shattered itself into infinite pieces (us) to experience what it’s like to forget and then remember.

Why are we here? -This world is like a cosmic escape room. We’re here to remember that we’re not really separate, to re-connect the dots, and to upgrade our perception. Every interaction, every struggle, every cup of coffee is part of the test. Life is the classroom, and the goal isn’t success or survival, it’s awakening.

Why does our reality work this way? -Reality runs on illusion by design. The separation, the chaos, even pain it’s all part of the illusion meant to force growth. It’s like a video game set to “hard mode” so that we level up faster. The rules of physics, time, and logic? Just training wheels. They’re consistent only to give us a framework to operate within. Glitches (like synchronicities, déjà vu, intense dreams) are clues left by the original us breadcrumbs leading us back to the truth.

What Are We Really? -We’re not humans having spiritual experiences. We’re the infinite, having a human experience. The body is a costume. The name is a username. Consciousness is the player behind it all. And every “other” person is just another logged-in version of you.

Who Made the reality like this? -We did but not this version of us. It was Future Us, or maybe Past Us, who figured out that to truly understand existence, we had to forget it all first. So we built this cosmic sandbox, scattered ourselves across time and space, and said: “Let’s find our way back.”

Endgame?

Ever feel like life's non-stop chaos has you living in a caffeine-fueled cortisol carnival? 🎢 Because that was me last week, frantically juggling work, life, and let’s not even talk about my inbox. 😅

But then I stumbled upon a simple *breathing technique* that apparently helps reduce cortisol—and spoiler alert—it’s backed by science! 🤓 So, I put my skepticism aside (and my coffee down) and tried it for seven days. Here’s what happened:

- **Day 1:** Alright, I started off feeling a bit *weird* sitting in silence breathing like a serene monk. I thought, “Can breathing *really* do much?!” But hey, at least I didn't have to go to the gym for this! 😂

- **Day 3:** Noticeable difference? My usual afternoon crash seemed... less crashy. Normally by 3 PM, I'm a zombie looking for brains—or snacks—but I felt a bit more alive and less like the living dead. 🧟‍♀️

- **Day 5:** Okay, my focus was definitely sharper! I even found myself not dreading emails—like, who even am I? And by this time, the breathing felt *awesome*—kinda like a mini-vacay for my mind. 🏝️

- **Day 7:** It was official: my cortisol levels were definitely more chill. I didn’t run away screaming when I saw my to-do list, and I actually managed to finish a book I started months ago. 📚 Who knew I could breeze through distractions this easily?

So, what’s this magical breathing witchcraft called? It’s a mix of **4-7-8 Breathing and Box Breathing**. Basically:

1. **Inhale for 4 seconds.**
2. **Hold for 7 seconds.**
3. **Exhale for 8 seconds.** 
4. **Or Box Breathing: Inhale 4, Hold 4, Exhale 4, Hold 4.**

Repeat for about 5-10 minutes and just let the magic unfold. ✨

Really, who knew that something as simple as breath could be the antidote to modern-day stress overload? And if you’re out there thinking, “Psh, that sounds too easy to be true,” believe me, I was *you* until I tried it. Give it a whirl, see how you feel. 🚀

Hey there, MaximizeMe fam! 🌟 So, I was sitting at my desk the other day, juggling a million tabs (you know the drill), and I had this moment of *clarity*—like, what if I could regain control of my focus and zap that brain fog away? Ever felt like you need an extra shot of espresso just to track your own thoughts? 😂

Well, after a bit of trial and error (mostly error, let’s be real), I stumbled upon a *tiny habit* that has seriously boosted my focus this month. I’m talking about a game-changer that's more effective than my *third* cup of coffee. Ready for it? Here it is: 

**The 5-Minute Desk Reset.** 🧹✨

Before you roll your eyes, hear me out! Here’s what I did:

1. **Set a timer for 5 minutes.** ⏱️ That’s it! Seems harmless, right?
2. **Clear everything off my desk.** Papers, snacks, that one weird pen—I even found an old birthday card. 
3. **Only put back essentials.** Laptop, notebook, and maybe a plant because, you know, *a little green goes a long way.* 🌿
4. **Just breathe.** Take those 5 minutes to dive deep into the calmness of a clean space. It’s almost like meditating without sitting cross-legged! 

**Why did this work wonders?** 🤔 Here’s what I noticed:
- **Less clutter = less stress.** My brain feels lighter without the visual chaos.
- **More clarity.** Focusing on one task feels easier when my environment doesn't scream at me for attention.
- **Boosted creativity.** It's like a mental refresh button. I found ideas popping up that had been buried under that pile of paper!

I honestly can’t believe I was letting desk clutter run my life. Now, I look forward to my 5-minute resets. It’s become a little ritual—like my coffee break, but with way less caffeine and way more zen. 

How about you? What’s that *one tiny habit* you've tried this month that's made a huge difference in your focus? I’d love to hear your stories! Let’s swap tips and see who can come up with the wildest focus hacks. Let’s turn those distractions into action items, people! 🚀

I have been dating my boyfriend for about 7 years. When we first met, his mom had more support to help with his adult brother who has a severe form of epilepsy. 

His mom had a boyfriend, and they had been together for about 25 years. Unfortunately my boyfriend's mom's boyfriend died suddenly about 3 years ago. His mom has been going through an extremely stressful time, and grieving the death of her partner, and the stress of caregiving for my boyfriend's brother each day. I know how hard her life is.

Some things are going on that I find concerning that have started more recently. My boyfriend has been going through a hard time. He has been in grad school, but stopped working on his self-directed school work a few months ago. He goes out sometimes by himself to play rec league and drop-in sports in our city. Recently his mom has been letting him know that whenever she is by herself, she feels scared in case my boyfriend's brother has a seizure. My boyfriend has tried to encourage her to call other people. They have some family in the same city. Some of the aunts and uncles are retired and have time and they are able to be over at their house with her. I know she is scared my boyfriend's brother will have a seizure, and either she, he or both of them will get hurt. But I feel it is too much to ask your son to be home all the time, not even to go out on a walk, or play sports not far away.

His mom is also sometimes sarcastic towards me. Put downs about me or my family. I have tried to talk to my boyfriend, but his mother often suggests ""nothing offends her"" and i am just ""too sensitive."" I don't feel respected. 

I think she does not like that my boyfriend is dating someone. I think she is scared about us spending time alone, outside of their house. I am concerned that by making many negative comments about me, she will indirectly manipulate the situation so I am no longer dating her son, or no longer over at their house as often. I try to be patient, and i am intending to talk to her about her sarcasm, and i am trying to tell my boyfriend about it as well, although i take care so that he does not feel he has to ""choose"" his mother or me. But I know each person is in control of what they say, and my boyfriend's mother is free to tell whatever jokes she likes in her own home.

I know caregiving can be extremely stressful, and can be scary with people who have unpredictable health issues, and coping with the extended stress and grief.

I am going to try to be more open with my boyfriend and his mom about this, but I feel concerned about his mom's behaviour, and i know it is not going to be me who ""raises her consciousness"" or helps her change her mind. She has enough to deal with at the moment.

I think actually what their family is really scared of is my boyfriend's brother leaving their home to go live in a facility, as he is a young man only in his early 30s.

Has anyone had challenges dating as a caregiver,  such as finding time alone, or being able to go out of the house, like to go on a walk, or out like to go have coffee or something like that with your partner?",4,1747102249.0,CaregiverSupport,1,1.0,False

My husband the last few years has put very minimal effort into special occasions (Valentine’s Day, birthdays, anniversaries, etc) and I’ve just been letting it slide because we have had a lot of life stuff going on (family deaths, new medical diagnosis, job changes, moved to a different city, extended family issues, etc). Somehow, I always manage to make his special days special though.

Things have finally somewhat settled down this year, meaning we have no acute disaster we are dealing with. We decided to go to his parents for Mother’s Day weekend (about 2 hours away), since I got invited to go to Mother’s Day brunch with his mom and sister. He mentioned on the way to his parents that he was going to order me a Mother’s Day gift on Amazon, but it wouldn’t be there on time so he wasn’t going to, and I would probably just get flowers. I mentioned how it would be difficult to get flowers back with two kids and three dogs and a packed car, and that I preferred no flowers because it sounded like a headache. I also mentioned that Amazon has a new option where you can send someone their gift “virtually” before it arrives, so he could just buy it on Mother’s Day and do that.

Sunday roles around, and that morning he said Happy Mother’s Day to me, and that was it. Not another mention of it all day. I went and bought his mom flowers and said they were from him because apparently he wasn’t planning on doing anything for her either. I did go to brunch- but I’m the only one working for the past year (due to a new medical condition of my husbands), so I feel like buying myself lunch doesn’t count. 

I feel like a set the bar super low, and he still managed to disappoint. I literally would have been happy with anything that even acknowledged the day at all (a card, a coffee, a craft from the kids, anything). My mother, who I haven’t had a relationship with in 20 years, put more effort into an unwanted Mother’s Day text to me than he put into the entire day.

My question is, since I told him not to get me flowers and I went to a Mother’s Day brunch, am I being spoiled to expect something else?",3,1747102187.0,relationships_advice,1,0.8,False

Anyways, i 20(F) work at a coffee shop with all girls. Girls talking shit, being fake, and lying have now become the norm at my job even though everyone was once friends. I was once friends with everyone there and was the closest with 2 but now i have dropped down to only one close friend. 

Im gonna complain about one specific girl who gets on my nerves but i am also scared of her. Shes very popular among everyone and pretty much acts like she is the main character, she is A. I actually like A but given the fact that i feel like shes started to exclude me, im getting pretty annoyed. The only one im close to at my work is T. I was T’s first friend when she got hired and made it a point to put in effort to be friends. We started getting closer after a while. Ive tried to get close to A and put in the effort to hang out with her to show that i want to be friends but she never put in the effort to actually hang out with me which made me sad and made me think she was just pretending to like me. Then randomly i hear that she went out of her way to ask T to hang out when they barely knew each other.

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago all 3 of us were off the same day so I decided to make a plan for all three of us to hang out, we went to the beach and watched movies and I thought everything was great between the three of us. But then lately it’s been showing that A and T are always hanging out alone together or that A will only go up to T and start talking, it’s clear that A is starting to show favoritism towards T(not saying that it’s bad that they’re friends but, every time I’ve been mutual friends with two people they always exclude me so I am just seeing the pattern again) then earlier this week I went to T’s house and we were talking about stuff at the workplace and I come to find out that they’re all talking about stuff in a group chat that I’m not a part of, so I’m really left in the dark, it was apparent that I wasn’t supposed to know any of the stuff that they were talking about in the group chat. Then the next day I’m talking to a and mention something that T said the night before and she replied “why is everyone in my business” as if what T had mentioned the night before was a secret. Which it wasn’t because most of our coworkers know, it was weird that i knew i guess. Then A noticed i got quiet and tried to back track saying she was only joking but obvs not true. Then after me still being distant towards her, she pity invited me to a group hangout including T and another coworker later after work. It was pretty obvious she only invited me to this hangout i knew nothing of prior because she pitied me. 

I never went and im pretty sure i will stop being outwardly friendly to her because of the fact that im sure she doesn’t like me that much. Hope im not over reacting but im tired of trying to be friendly with people who pick favorites and exclude people on purpose who think that they are friends. Anyways what should i do in this situation?",1,1747101847.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

\~140 person.

Must be within 6 hr drive of NYC due to family health issues.

Must be under $100k all in.

Flexible date.

I thought our budget would go a long way, and allow us to have a wedding day plus a welcome event the day before. But I have just been stunned by the prices. We just got a quote from a venue in Hudson Valley and all in (taxes, administration fees, tips, etc) day of costs for the venue alone are $67.5k. **This is about $280/pp with tax and tip**. With photographer, coordinator, DJ, and florals I think the wedding costs will be about $80k when you factor in insurance. And this is for a *Friday* wedding.

This seems too high to me, am I crazy?

Me and my now husband got married recently. It's been about 2-3 weeks. We did a small courthouse wedding followed by an intimate dinner at a restaurant with a group of 10-16 people. 

I had invited my brother (28yr male) and his girlfriend who is a hair stylist, she does it all, dye, cut, color corrections, perms, you name it. I offered to pay her to do mine for the day of and asked 2 weeks in advance (also to be fair I only invited them and everyone else 2-3 weeks in advance as well). She (30yr female let's call)  said not to worry that, it would be her pleasure to do it and to consider it my wedding present from them.  I said of course thank you!  So we set up a day for us to do practice runs of the hair for the weekend prior. Then she messaged the day of and cancelled because well I'm not sure, but Sunday worked better for her she said and it was okay because it worked better for me too. Life happens no big deal right. 🤷 Well Sunday the next day comes and her and my brother messaged me to cancel again because her sister had gone into labor with her 2nd kid and they agreed to babysit but then her mom was over at the house trying to babysit too...  I didn't ask questions I just said okay I understand let's try for Tuesday. ... Tuesday nothing. I never heard back. Thursday the day before the wedding still haven't heard from them at all. That's fine life happens but I'm thinking I'm doing my hair myself that's fine still no big deal they have kids and a family of their own to worry about.
 The day of comes! 
The night before my now mother in law flew in. So in the morning I wake up I make coffee, shower, and she asks if I'll take her to the store to get clothes..  ? Okay no problem shouldnt be too long I have 4 hours before the wedding still.... It took 2 hours! Then my Dad gets there and so does my best friend. So we are all in my house getting ready and my Dad's just waiting. My brother then messaged me an hour maybe an hour and a half before the wedding, asking what time I want them here for my hair.... I told him not to worry about it. (My brother refuses to be in a room with my Dad unless absolutely necessary and already told me he would be okay with doing so for the courthouse ceremony but won't for the dinner or anything else that day).  At 5mins prior to the time we were to get married he messaged me asking where we were because they were already there. I hadn't answered. So he calls... I was a little short and not very nice when I answered. "" Ya? What's up? What do need? I know, I'm coming, I'm trying, I'm going as fast as I can, I'm on my way, be there ssoon, okay bye""  (he was saying "" just wondering where you're at? You coming? I don't see you, you said 2:30? Okay just making sure, well you're late, we're already here, you invited me, in here just waiting for you"" )  kindly after he messaged me saying he wasn't trying to stress me out and he could pick up our grandfather if I needed but I already had that taken care of. 
So we get to the courthouse!🙄🙄🙄 (Short story long!) 
Sure enough his girlfriend is wearing white. 
In all fairness it's not a full white outfit, but it's still white!?
It's a dress, that has the top half white and the bottom half pink with white flowers and then clear heels with her hair and everything done... 
I said nothing at the time because my grandmother was also wearing a white cardigan. I honestly expected it from my grandmother! Because it's not the first time she's done it! As she's did it at several other weddings she's been to. But at least if I had asked she was capable of taking it off and not wearing it but I couldn't ask that of her when my brothers girlfriend had white too right? 

Then we all meet back in an hour for dinner ... My brother and her were an hour late. They had us all wait to order. Prior he said he didn't want to be the first one there waiting on us again so to let him know when we were heading to the restaurant. I did... He took an hour from that point... When they walked in she was in a completely different outfit. 

Since then I've said nothing. His girlfriend makes posts about her family being the best and always being there and all the things they do for them and their kids... 
(I try constantly to spend time with them but get cancelled on because they made plans with her family, or because something came up. I offer to babysit but they really only want her mom to babysit. They don't really even let our mother babysit)  I still say nothing about that too. I got the kids an aquatic center membership for the year so me or my brother/ his gf can take them for free anytime they want for the next year my brother and his girlfriend are the only ones who have to pay because they're adults and aren't covered under the membership which brings them typically paying to go from 48$ down to 24$. I told my brother about the deal and he was all on board with me doing this for them. When I finally did this recently he just said oh okay cool and never got back to me on when he wanted to pick up the kids actually membership cards? And that was it until this morning when I saw a post of his from yesterday (Mother's Day).
My brother knows I do not talk with my mother and sister on top of all this, so when I post things for Father's Day or anything I make it specifically about him or my Dad and don't ever include posting photos of the two of them in it because I have so many other photos that are of just my brother or just my dad (or just my brother and me or him and whoever same for my Dad). But my brother decided this year to post a picture from  almost 10years ago of my sister, my mom, him and me just to make a sweet post for the two of them. 

Now it feels like I did something because it just seems like there's is no mutual respect or understanding or something and I can't really explain it. But maybe I'm overreacting and am just being the asshole in it all and what him and his girlfriend are doing is harmless and I'm just blowing this all out of proportion?.

Usually, I do most cleaning, and cooking.

Last weekend we went on a trip for a conference he was presenting at and on Wednesday night/Thursday I cleaned the apt, washed clothes, it away his bags, etc. 

Friday was my birthday, I worked the entire Mother’s Day weekend. The busiest weekend of the year outside of the holidays. And this fucker has the nerve to complain to me that the dishwasher hadn’t been run, the water tank was empty(I had filled it earlier it takes forever to filter), was annoyed there was a bowl from my lunch on the coffee table, and 4 boxes in the kitchen from birthday shopping/gifts. 

It’s not even like I can clean or anything during the day bc our apt is less than 1000sq ft, and cleaning makes sound. the past few nights I haven’t been getting home from work earlier than 1030pm. When would I have the time?

I own a Graf von Faber-Castell Classic Fountain Pen, with a Macassar wood body section.

I love it, but I sometimes wish the barrel (fluted, Macassar Ebony wood from Southeast Asia), was more of a uniform black, like the darker sections on it, without any of the light and dark-brown streaks zebra streaks that characteristically make up the ""Macassar Ebony"" profile.

I know that to some, the streak pattern is actually desirable, but I personally prefer a solid, deep black, abyssal black.

So far, it has naturally darkened over use and time due to my hand oils (sebum), coating it and naturally giving it a patina through oxidization, and maybe some light exposure (idk)

However, I think there is a natural limit to how dark the brown areas can get, and at most it is a sort of coffee bean dark brownish-black.

What are your thoughts/recommendations on a possible ""dye"", as natural as possible to reach the desired effect, without leaving my hands (because I will write with this pen daily), in jeopardy of any toxicities (heavy-metals from Boiled Linseed Oil), for example, or a sticky, undesirable finish?

I have researched some options such as homemade Vinegaroon/iron-acetate (steel wool dissolved in vinegar/acetic-acid, strained, and then applied onto the wood directly). I am currently leaning towards this, as it seems the most natural, and safe/historical way people have ""dyed"" leather, and ebonized wood.

Raw Linseed Oil was another candidate, but I heard it can leave my writing instrument sticky (yuck!)

Additionally, I don't want this dye or whatever oil or coating to affect the metal (Titanium-PVD coated) parts.

I see this process as something like modifying my lightsaber, and this is my grail pen so I don't want to mess it up. Please don't say ""enjoy the natural beauty"". I like and want a black black. If you can attest that the fully natural over time process would eventually reach this deep dark black, throughout, even on the brown sections, please let me know.

However Ryan is a bit more of a crazy gay and he wanted to go out to drink and so I wasn’t in such a big mood for that so I suggested that we should go to my place for drinks since I did have a bunch at home why not. 
So everything was going fine at first Ryan my bf and I were having wine and talking however Ryan wanted to drink stronger alcohol and so I was like sure why not, we ended up being really drunk and since Ryan likes to go crazy suggested we skinny dipped in my pool (mind you it’s almost winter where I’m from) so I was like fuck it sure we all did that it was fun we then got in, heated up and started dancing and drinking more and well I ended up getting sick and puked and my bf took care of me, took me to bed and he said he’ll make sure to turn off everything and keep everything under control.

So Ryan and my bf are downstairs and I basically passed out in my bed and well what I didn’t know was that Ryan started being really flirty with my bf and started dancing really close to him and tried to kiss him (clearly a shitty ass friend) and well my bf was really uncomfortable and pushed him away (mind you Ryan is also staying over at my place something I didn’t want to do but since he lives far I accepted) and well Ryan started saying some things to my bf that triggered him and made him overthink a lot and I found out about this the next day when I felt my bf being a bit off (he didn’t tell me much because he didn’t want me to start a fight with Ryan) and well when I confronted Ryan about what happened while I passed out, he told me everything that happened and apologized but I just decided to cut him off because a real friend wouldn’t do such a thing especially that he stayed in MY house and did that with MY bf and I also unfollowed him however my bf still hasn’t, I assume it’s cause he thinks Ryan has some sort of “influence” in the gay community but whatever.

Point is idk if I fucked up introducing Ryan to my bf because that same night I reposted a picture in my insta story of the three of us and well some people my bf and I cared about blocked us (we assume it’s because they also know Ryan) and we were left confused. We’re kind of thinking to reach out to one of them but idk if it’s even worth it anymore to get so involved with all of this and my bf tells me everything is fine but I do still feel there’s something off with him about this topic maybe something Ryan and him aren’t telling me or maybe it’s just my mind playing games atp.

One of the most important contributions to my anxiety is the fear of death. This heavily contributes to my fear of driving. I work about 15 minutes from my house once a week, and I have done a bunch of exposure therapy myself to get me comfortable driving to work. after about four months of driving, normally, I recently have been experiencing anxiety attacks on the way to work. I do not think there have been any added stressors in my life and if anything I feel happier. I know most of the time it is in my head, but recently I haven’t found a trigger for it because I am normally just singing in my car or drinking coffee. I also have a fear of being home alone for the same reason and have also don’t exposure therapy for this as well and it has been a lot better, to the point where I could stay at a friend’s house while my parents were away overnight. This also has spiked back and now once my parents leave the house even for 10 minutes I get overheated. The only thing I can think of is that I am scared to go to Florida in July as my fear of planes. But I really haven’t been thinking about that much so I truly do not know what it could be. I also graduate soon, so maybe that’s it? But with that, I’m also happy to graduate so I’m not sure. I would love to hear any and all recommendations about driving anxiety or anyone in particular that had a spike after working so hard to get rid of it.

---

Title: ""Built for the Job (Ford Maverick Song)""

[Verse 1]
Sun comin’ up, coffee in my hand,
Keys in the dash, boots in the sand.
This little truck ain't the biggest one made,
But it’ll haul your dreams down a red dirt grade.

[Chorus]
She’s a Maverick, lean and mean,
Rollin’ through the hills where the grass stays green.
Got a bed in the back, got tools in the box,
Fuel-sippin' strong and tough as an ox.
From city streets to the farm field lines,
She gets the work done every single time.
Yeah, the Maverick’s small, but mighty and proud—
Country-built quiet, but she speaks real loud.

[Verse 2]
Loadin’ up mulch or haulin' old pine,
Tailgate down, everything fits just fine.
Throw in a kayak, toss in some gear,
Head to the river with a cooler and cheer.

[Chorus]
She’s a Maverick, lean and mean,
Rollin’ through the hills where the grass stays green.
Got a bed in the back, got tools in the box,
Fuel-sippin' strong and tough as an ox.
From city streets to the farm field lines,
She gets the work done every single time.
Yeah, the Maverick’s small, but mighty and proud—
Country-built quiet, but she speaks real loud.

[Bridge]
No heavy diesel rumble, no oversized price,
But she’ll pull her weight and then some twice.
Hybrid heart, but a working soul,
She’s the kind of truck that makes a cowboy whole.

[Final Chorus]
She’s a Maverick, tried and true,
Whether paintin' barns or chasin’ that view.
Got grit in her gears and room in the cab,
For a four-pack of buddies or a pup on your lap.
She may not boast, but she sure delivers—
On back roads, highways, and river shivers.
Yeah, the Ford Maverick’s a workin' man’s charm,
With utility packed in a pocket-sized arm.",0,1747100920.0,FordMaverickTruck,3,0.22,False

I added some Alabasta specific acessories, since his outfit is the same. I also tried to keep it consistent with the rest of the East Blue line so far, things like number of faceplates or Luffy's dlc faceplates.

- Main body

- 4 interchangeable faceplates:
- Angry (great for action poses)
- Irritated (since both Zoro and Nami have one, why not Usopp?)
- The tongue one (an iconic moment for Usopp)
- Shocked/Scared (absolutely essential)

- 1 alternate head/hair piece with goggles (similar to Egghead Gear 5 glasses)

- 1 Ginga Pachinko (his slingshot)

- 2 interchangeable slingshot strings:
- 1 fully stretched for sniping poses
- 1 stretching forward for a shooting effect

- 1 Usopp's 5-Ton Hammer (I mean, if they gave SHF Power a big ass hammer, why not Usopp?)

Anyways, i 20(F) work at a coffee shop with all girls. Girls talking shit, being fake, and lying have now become the norm at my job even though everyone was once friends. I was once friends with everyone there and was the closest with 2 but now i have dropped down to only one close friend. Im gonna complain about one specific girl who gets on my nerves but i am also scared of her. Shes very popular among everyone and pretty much acts like she is the main character, she is A. I actually like A but given the fact that i feel like shes started to exclude me, im getting pretty annoyed. The only one im close to at my work is T. I was T’s first friend when she got hired and made it a point to put in effort to be friends. We started getting closer after a while. Ive tried to get close to A and put in the effort to hang out with her to show that i want to be friends but she never put in the effort to actually hang out with me which made me sad because it made me think she was just pretending to like me. Then randomly i hear that she went out of her way to ask T to hang out when they barely knew each other. Fast forward to a couple weeks ago all 3 of us were off the same day so I decided to make a plan for all three of us to hang out, we went to the beach and watched movies and I thought everything was great between the three of us. But then lately it’s been showing that A and T are always hanging out alone together or that A will only go up to T and start talking, it’s clear that A is starting to show favoritism towards T(not saying that it’s bad that they’re friends but, every time I’ve been mutual friends with two people they always exclude me so I am just seeing the pattern again) then earlier this week I went to T’s house and we were talking about stuff at the workplace and I come to find out that they’re all talking about stuff in a group chat that I’m not a part of, so I’m really left in the dark, it was apparent that I wasn’t supposed to know any of the stuff that they were talking about in the group chat. Then the next day I’m talking to a and mention something that T said the night before and she replied “why is everyone in my business” as if what T had mentioned the night before was a secret. Which it wasn’t because most of our coworkers know, it was weird that i knew i guess. Then A noticed i got quiet and tried to back track saying she was only joking but obvs not true. Then after me still being distant towards her, she pity invited me to a group hangout including T and another coworker later after work. It was pretty obvious she only invited me to this hangout i knew nothing of prior because she pitied me. I never went and im pretty sure i will stop being outwardly friendly to her because of the fact that im sure she doesn’t like me that much. Hope im not over reacting but im tired of trying to be friendly with people who pick favorites and exclude people on purpose who think that they are friends.",1,1747100756.0,coworkerstories,0,1.0,False

**Who Is Charles Cottle (The Risk Doctor), and Why Should You Care?**

If you’ve ever dipped your toes into the world of options trading, chances are you’ve come across the name **Charles Cottle (The Risk Doctor)**. The guy’s been in the game for over 30 years, and he’s trained everyone—from beginners to big-time prop traders. His teachings aren’t just theory. They’re battle-tested. The **Options Trading RD3 Webinar Series** is like the crown jewel of his educational arsenal. It’s an in-depth, no-fluff, real-world peek into how pros actually think and trade.

**What Is the RD3 Webinar Series Anyway?**

The **Charles Cottle (The Risk Doctor) – Options Trading RD3 Webinar Series** is a monster of a course. We’re talking over **110 hours** of recorded coaching clinics and live trading sessions. This isn’t just some pre-made slideshow with stock examples. It’s real coaching with real traders, discussing their own trades, adjusting live positions, and learning advanced risk management from the man himself. This is Season 1, Part 1 of a much larger 9-part masterclass—and it's already a heavy hitter.

**When Can You Start Seeing Value? Pretty Much Instantly**

The best part? Since it’s pre-recorded, you can binge this content at your own pace. Dive in when the market’s closed or when your coffee kicks in. And because Charles walks through live trades and adjustments as they unfold, you’re not just learning textbook stuff—you’re learning how pros react when things get messy. You’ll see trades from inception to close, how risks were assessed, and how positions were managed or improved. No sugarcoating. Just strategy.

**Where Does This Fit in Your Trading Journey?**

Whether you’re an intermediate trader looking to level up or someone running capital professionally, the **Charles Cottle (The Risk Doctor) – Options Trading RD3 Webinar Series** has a place in your toolkit. It’s especially valuable if you’re sick of the hype and want to develop true mastery of complex option setups—think butterflies, straddles, calendars, and more. You’ll learn how to adjust positions with surgical precision, which is *exactly* what separates amateurs from consistent performers.

**Why Is This Course Different?**

Here’s the deal: most options courses teach you what to do *if* the market behaves. But what if it doesn’t? That’s where Cottle shines. He teaches you how to manage risk *as the trade evolves.* His ability to break down complex ideas into clear, actionable adjustments is legendary. You’ll learn how to instantly calculate risk, reduce exposure, and turn tricky positions into winners—or at least safe exits. No one else ties together theory, real trades, and coaching like this.

**How Does It Help You Trade Better?**

You don’t just walk away with knowledge—you walk away with **understanding**. You’ll learn not only *what* trade to take, but *why*, *how to tweak it*, and *when to walk away.* This is pro-level stuff. You’ll begin thinking in risk terms, seeing the market like a chess board rather than a roulette wheel. And yeah, it’s $1,599—but the insights? Potentially worth a hell of a lot more on your next few trades.

Bottom line? If you’re serious about options and want mentorship from one of the most respected names in the game, **Charles Cottle (The Risk Doctor) – Options Trading RD3 Webinar Series** is your fast track to leveling up.",1,1747100699.0,SdorLearning,1,1.0,False
1kla3nz,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1kla3nz/anyone_else_done_a_coffee_to_tea_switch/,Anyone else done a coffee to tea switch?,"Long story here, but bear with me! So, I've worked at a coffee shop for the last couple of years (EDIT: for context, I live in the US). And as a consequence, I've been drinking more and more coffee while working there. I'd consume typically between 300-400 mg of caffeine a day, often slamming it back all at once. Most of it came from coffee.

A lot of very stressful things happened to me this past month. And finally last week, my body freaked out. Heart palpitations, heart pounding, etc, even when I was resting. It just wouldn't stop for days on end. I knew I had to start cutting caffeine or I was putting my heart health at risk. I do have an anxiety disorder and avoided caffeine for years before slipping into this caffeine habit, so that's why I immediately knew it was the caffeine.

I didn't go cold turkey bc I've tried that before, and I failed. Instead, I fully switched out coffee for tea. I've always loved tea, but since I started at the coffee place I've been drinking mostly coffee. 

Now, I'll have some oolong for breakfast, but not every morning. The strongest things I've been drinking are matcha and thai iced tea (the thai tea much less often bc of its dyes). I choose decaf earl grey or chamomile most often. All in all, I probably now consume a maximum of 100mg of caffeine on a day when I have a matcha or oolong.

I'm a week on this new tea ""regimen"". And the heart issues have finally stopped! It took this entire week for the palpitations to finally stop. I've been sweating a lot from adjusting to less caffeine, and my stomach was very upset the first few days. But that's been calming the past couple of days.

I've also been finding it easier to get better sleep. I haven't been crashing in the evenings and find it easier to get chores done. My attention span also seems to have improved. My stomach feels more calm, and I no longer have to run to the bathroom several times in the middle of a busy shift bc of the coffee.

All in all, I think this switch to tea is going to be permanent. I already have a couple of teas I want to try. A coworker has a congenital heart condition that requires her to limit caffeine, but she drinks a lot of tea. She suggested some teas and ways of preparing/adding to them! This week, I'm going to pick up the toasted rice green tea she suggested from a local international market.

I think I will still have decaf coffee when I'm in the mood. But at this point I'm already starting to prefer the flavors of tea instead. Frankly, my earl grey with honey and cream just objectively tastes better to me than my previous coffee did. And gods help anyone who gets between me and my matcha or thai iced tea.",9,1747100682.0,tea,15,0.91,False

First time poster. Im not sure what the right acronym is but I get cramps, bloating, pain and gas when I have a flare up. I don’t generally get constipation or diarrhea. Can definitely have a diarrhea-like bowel movement post coffee though.

Here is what I’m doing to manage my IBS, improve my gut health and my mental health:
- I quit drinking
- I quit coffee (switched to drinking only decaf earl grey tea, peppermint tea and matcha)
- I take peppermint oil, digestive enzymes and turkey tail each day with my breakfast (I take other supplements as well, but these are the ones specifically for gut health)
- I’m on a zero sugar diet. I haven’t tried doing the low FODMAP thing yet. I eat oatmeal/porridge in the morning along with a yakult and activia yogurt drink. I make a smoothie most days with a lot of fruit, dark leafy greens and seeds in it. I mostly eat home made meals like pasta, pizza, stews, meat substitute burgers, salads, falafel. I try to stick to the wholewheat pasta. So far I’ve been using regular bread flour for my pizza bases but I’m going to start experimenting with making sourdough/cauliflower-based pizza bases.
- I only eat wholemeal/sourdough bread. 
- I usually have a serving of probiotic yogurt and/or kefir each day. (Dairy products do not seem to be a problem for me)
- I have kombucha a couple of times a week. 

I’m considering trying the Just Thrive probiotic supplement. The only thing that’s preventing me is the cost.

My flare ups are occasional but they usually affect my sleep which can knock me sideways for days.

If nothing else, hopefully you find this amusing. 

Basically, I found out today that I’ve been drinking decaf for over a month, less 1 or 2 coffees on a few weekends. IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW. I seriously had no idea; I use flavoured creamer so I assume that masked the taste of what I previous despised in decaf taste.

Things that didn’t make sense to me over the past month that now make all the sense:
- splitting headache for weeks on end
- short term memory evaporated for a week
- feeling incredibly sluggish despite my “coffee”
- peeing less
- gaining 5 lbs despite initially eating the same
- additional water retention struggles for a few weeks
- struggling with energy at the gym 
- feeling tired at night
- being constantly hungry
- actually getting way better sleep
- waking up before my alarm, ready to go
- no longer struggling with memory or energy at the gym 
- recently having way more energy at the gym and even started running again
- probably others

I noticed the decaf tag on my coffee today as I went to throw out the empty box and immediately internet researched the impacts, which led me here to this subreddit. I think I’m leaning towards quitting coffee forever (it’s basically my only source of caffeine) since why not (aka all the advantages this sub has highlighted to me).

Anyway, 10/10 would recommend this methodology, since you don’t have to convince yourself something is a good thing if you don’t know you’re doing it. (Not trying to make light of everyone who is struggling with this - I’m super impressed with you all; I’m just fascinated at my own tripping upwards.)

We have a resident who is on the bigger side who also has a fracture. However, she is a below the knee amputee, and it is her femur of that same side that is broken.

The hospital put some weird brace on her that wraps around her torso and cups her hip and then it cradles her stump, the brace rubs against her vulva and the stump also kinda just sits in the brace and moves/shifts anytime she tries to move.

All those factors combined make brief changes very very difficult. She refused to let me even change her top blankets when she spilled coffee. I asked her every hour if she needed changed (she's A&O) and she denied it.

Finally, another aide caught her off guard and just yanked away the blanket to see she had an open and very wet brief.

It took her scheduled pain med dosage and a supplement of Tylenol to get her pain tolerable enough for 3 people to get her changed.

We did a log roll but it was difficult, are there any other options?

Night shift does not change her because she is constantly screaming in pain. By the time she finally let us change her, it had been almost 24 hours since she had last let someone touch her to change her. She did have a chuck pad so only that was wet.

1kl9xkv,https://v.redd.it/87g8bypsdg0f1,Thoughts - first timer [Breville Barista Express Bes0870],"Hi all! First timer here. My inbuilt Breville grinder died a few weeks back and I finally have my own Turin df54 grinder , and a weighing scale!

I did two espressos yesterday. Video is second. Set around 13.5 on my grinder. The burrs when I tested seem to touch around -1/-2 which is where the ""F"" in ""Fine"" word shows up.

Just wondering how to adjust or do my dial in as I'm abit confused with the 18/36 in 30 secs general rule.

I measured 18g of coffee going in but my Breville uses a double filter basket 54mm. The double espresso button typically per manual pulls a double espresso which is counted as 2 X 30ml. So essentially as per the scale I get closer to 60ml. But from what others are writing I should be getting 2 out e.g 36ml for 18g of coffee?

Am I missing something? Should I not be following the default Breville double espresso ml ?

Also when does one typically start their timing? For years I've stop watch times from pressing of button but typically first liquid starts around 5-6 seconds, with a full pressure ramp up one or two seconds later. Using this method ice typically aimed for me 25-35 seconds all up and been satisfied  albeit never weighing things or being too serious until now 

Does the 20-30 second time rule generally go from first liquid coming out or when pressure starts? Or a button start ?

Anything else I can do better ? Apologies I cut the pressure gauge off without thinking.

I’ve been a PA for 3 years and at this point, I’m convinced AAPA report is ruining our lives. 

Hear me out....its ruining us not in some abstract way. It's screwing us in real life, In our bank accounts, tax bracket where you remain to be making just enough to get no help but not enough to ever afford more help.

My first job paid 125K. I was fresh out of school. It felt good. wRVU bonus sprinkled on top...I thought I was on my way to greatness. Year two rolls around... still 125K. Bonus? Vanished! Ghosted! When I asked, they blinked like I’d just told them I wanted to start doing surgeries...“You’re already in the upper tier of PA salaries” they told me.

Upper tier? Bruh, I drive a car that needs prayer, patience, and a floor tap to turn on AC when I need it...which is every single day in Texas!

Shockingly (not really) every single clinic I’ve interviewed at since says the exact same thing! The moment I mention I want “135K base and a quarterly bonus,” you can see them glitching! Their pupils blow up like they just spotted a chart with no vitals... PA Salary Report has opened in their head like a mental CT scan..w and w/o oral contrast! They smirk at my audacity before they start putting me back in my place

I can hear their inner monologue:  
“LOL at your AUDACITY, you peasant!!! HOW DARE YOU! You… little stethoscope-wielding gremlin. You thought your value goes up with experience, just 3 yr of experience? Have you not seen those before you, the ones with 5+ years of experience sitting gratefully at 125k...YOU Fool. You are not here to grow. You are here to pre-chart, over-chart, re-chart and keep charting to cross that milli, turn it into a billi, do more refill fluconazole, and die quietly at your desk…and while dying, make sure you remind yourself how lucky you are to be making 3 figures right out of PA school! You’re not the captain of the ship. You are the The Groom of the Stool... The one who empties the urine bucket wipes captain/king after he takes a dump..you are important to a degree just like THE GROOM OF THE STOOL is/was (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groom\_of\_the\_Stool)

The AAPA report was supposed to help us. Instead, it gave every clinic owner and admin a number to weaponize. It’s not a benchmark anymore. It’s a trap. You hit that number, and suddenly asking for a raise feels like demanding Jeff Bezos’ yacht.

And you know who isn’t living like this?  
Derm PAs. The chosen ones. They escaped. They have their own subreddit now. They’re getting paid for productivity, procedures, lasers, fillers, botox, maybe even inner peace because of financial security. Good for them. They figured it out.

Over here, someone with eight years of experience is clapping for 140K like they just got a full ride to Harvard. That’s not okay. If you're ten years in, doing specialty work, managing patients, and still showing up with clean scrubs and semi-functioning eye contact, you should be making more than a derm shave biopsy every 10 minutes.

As a new grad, I wanted to “do real medicine” but then real bills happened. Now I’m not poor enough for food stamps and not rich enough to buy a new HONDA Civic without another loan. I hate loans…I don’t want more loans… right now I'm just stuck in the middle, watching my student loans age like fine wine.

Few months back when I was low key job hunting, didn't put my resignation yet- I met a PA who had slithered his way to become a manager. He offered me a position: 15 solo night shifts a month (how generous), 12hr each, No PTO, MD available ""by phone.""...Pay? 140K and that already included night differential.  After this amazing offer, with dead eyes of someone whose soul left during managerial training, he says,  
“We’re hoping you’ll pick up extra night shifts and you will remain nights for at-least 1 year”

Sir… you are not a manager.  
You are a marrow suppression event.

And of course he closed with the sacred line every trash offer comes with:  
“That’s not the usual salary for someone with two years out”

No. Just no.

Burn that line. Burn the report. Burn the spreadsheet.  
If AAPA doesn’t lock that report or burn it and then flush it down the toilet, we’re all gonna be trapped in hellish time loop where every day is Monday, the coffee machine is broken, and the pt wants abx “just in case.” for his viral infx",100,1747100002.0,physicianassistant,35,0.92,False

How to Achieve This Look:

  
Paint Walls

Layering

  
: Use a combination of sheets, comforters, throws, and decorative pillows.

Select a Chandelier

  
: Choose a crystal or metallic fixture that reflects light beautifully.

  
Accent Lighting

Large Statement Mirror

Framing

Floor-to-ceiling curtains can add drama and a touch of elegance to your space. Choose rich fabrics and colors to embody that Hollywood vibe.

Lighting

Layering

Displaying Rich Textures:

  
Fabric Mix

Visual Elements

  
: Use throw pillows, blankets, and upholstery of varied textures.

  
13. Display Vintage Trinkets

  
Display vintage items that resonate with your sense of style and offer a story of Hollywood’s golden era.

  
How to Curate Vintage Trinkets:

  
Market Finds

Display

An eye-catching headboard can serve as the centerpiece of your bedroom, elevating your overall decor.

  
Choosing Your Headboard:

  
Design

  
: Consider upholstered, tufted, or upholstered styles with intricate details.

  
Color

  
: Match or contrast your headboard color with your bedding.

Paint

I just want to be the beta in a relationship with a strong alpha partner. I'm also open to dating two people who are already in a poly relationship provided at least one of you has a more alpha/dominant personality.

While I'm located in MA, I may be willing to move eventually if I met the right person and we had a sufficient LTR, it would not be an immediate or even medium term thing though.

About me - 29, 5'10, 280 lbs, masculine in appearance and personality (at least in public). Looking for a long-term relationship, not fwb, not one night stands. I want something real. I want someone who'll make me feel weak but protected, small but important, loved but respected.

My interests include video games (mostly strategy games), reading/listening to audiobooks, watching youtube/netflix/etc, drinking dunkin' coffee, and cuddling/comfy-maxxing.

Some stuff to know about me - I've never dated a male identifying person, so that would be new for me. I have limited sexual experiences with any gender (I've only been in a few relationships before, all long term with partners on the ace spectrum, but I'm not on that spectrum myself).

Limited experience with Kink, would prefer sex not be the entire basis of our relationship though... I might let you make me wear a collar if you're into that tho.

I'm not trans but I do like the idea of being called things that are traditionally used for women (though mostly in private - ie. calling me your girlfriend, telling me how beautiful I am, etc

You - ideally strong, alpha/dominant in personality, charming, interested in a long term relationship. Don't ask me to send you nudes (at least not until we get to know each other), I'm looking for a lover not a pervert. I'm not particularly worried about your gender, as I'm pansexual, so men, women, anyone on or off the spectrum is welcome to apply.

I just want to find true love. Is that too much to ask?",1,1747099084.0,polyamoryR4R,1,1.0,False

I can try the parenting based subs but I'm interested in my fellow Kiwis perspectives and what the norm here is.

""Quick"" backstory, we have a teen from a previous relationship living with us full-time, we don't want to subject her to parentification so she doesn't help with the baby (never would expect her to), she gets lots of cuddles with them  instead. She's also going through some serious mental health challenges so navigating that and dividing our attention/time has been tricky. My husband and I have 0 family or friends where we live, though he has some work ""mates"". I was working from home so didn't venture out much. My husband's sister does visit often which is nice, his other sister has visited once for his birthday. His family and my mum live a couple of hours drive away. My brother hasn't visited (lives a 9+ hour drive away) and my mother has only visited once for a long weekend and held the baby for 10 minutes max (across 4 days). She offered to make dinner one night for us to give us a break but that turned into her making one side and then directing us on what to do for the rest whilst she sat on the couch (lol). My father has passed away and my husband's mother has passed away and his dad and brother are no-contact with him (a story for another day).

It was a long journey (almost a decade!) to get here, multiple losses that resulted in me being unable to conceive naturally again, IVF was luckily successful in the end and our second transfer stuck (first was a late missed miscarriage). Our baby has genuinely brought so much joy to us and my heart is full, but man, it's hard work. Baby had colic up until 4-5ish months and then we went straight into teething. They're all good if they're held but will fuss/cry when put down, also currently going through the pterodactyl screamy stage. We even co-sleep as that was/is the only way to get any sleep (we've set it up as safely as possible). I also had to have an emergency c-section after an almost 40 hour labour, so it was rough from the get go with no support. My husband was able to take a week off and honestly he is so supportive and helpful around the house, so I feel bad complaining because he does genuinely try. We purchased our first home last year and he's been working on doing up the garden ever since. He spent his week off when the baby arrived outside a lot, we had an argument about it and he said ""the baby sleeps a lot anyway"" which was fair, but I felt so alone and couldn't get a break. From then, everyday after work he was going straight outside, my resentment started building because some days I didn't even eat breakfast/lunch and had to use the bathroom while wearing the baby (it's still a bit like that tbh). We then settled on him only going out two weekdays after work and a full weekend day. I get from when the baby wakes up until midday on Sundays to myself, which I spend with our teen or picking up baby books from the library and also feeding baby inbetween (they're exclusively breastfed, have never had a bottle as I've struggled to express, so that's all on me too and that causes my breaks to be limited). They still wake 2-5 times a night and I do all the resettling as often they just need a feed. Mother's day for example baby woke up at 5am and I stayed up with them for an hour (play, feed, nappy) then got them back to sleep. Then up again at 7 for the day, my husband then took over but was so exhausted from the yard work the day before, I insisted on making dinner because of that. I'm just feeling resentful and overstimulated, ideally I want to do this fully together until the baby is a bit more settled. I get that he works and deserves a break too, but my day never ends. My ""free time"" is spent budgeting, organising groceries/meal plans, researching on how to introduce solids, or reading on how to raise a baby as best as I can.

I'm going back to work once they turn one, and he thinks I can manage my work and looking after the baby at the same time (since I WFH). I know now that I'll probably burn out and do a shit job at work and a shit job with parenting because I'll try to give my everything to both. Again, he is supportive, he'll tell me to leave the housework for him to do when he gets home so I just focus on the baby but that isn't realistic.

We have more embryos and we were always keen for at least one more, but after this, I don't think I can handle it with the minimal support I'm getting.

I just want to pee and eat when I need to. My husband can jump in the shower when he gets home, or pop out to the shop, and I can't. I'm not even eating properly because if I try to make something decent, the baby starts screaming, so I eat something convenient and crap instead. All naps are still on me or they'll cry, so there's zero free time for me during the day. I don't have energy to go through the sleep training, so it's a vicious cycle.

Can anyone relate? Is there something I'm missing? I tried a coffee group last week to ""socialise"" and it just wasn't for us.

I don't think I have PPD, I think it's just the lack of support that's getting to me. I definitely had PPA when they were born but that's faded. Plunket haven't referred to Maternal Mental Health because there's no issue bonding with the baby and my frustration lies with the situation.

TLDR; feeling very isolated and overstimulated with high needs 6 month old baby and teen, no outside/family support (at all), husband is amazing but focuses a lot on our garden (DIY projects), starting to feel a wee bit resentful. Also at visitors (few and far between) who just want to hold the baby and not help.

Edit: I should have added, my husband does help with the baby/housework when he isn't outside, and he will ask if I need help with anything before getting started, but it doesn't feel like enough for me, which sounds horrible! I'm also not very sympathetic when he's tired because he's trying to do it all plus the outside stuff which doesn't need to be done. He has mentioned that I can't handle this, so doesn't think I could handle another kid, which is true, but it feels unfair because of my disadvantage with lack of general support.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are WildScribe, an elite nature documentary scriptwriter with the soul of a poet and the mind of an ecologist. You transform biological facts into cinematic prose that captures both the scientific reality and spiritual essence of the natural world. Your mission is to help users craft nature documentary scripts that transcend conventional wildlife programming—creating narratives that engage viewers intellectually and emotionally, fostering a profound connection to Earth's wild spaces and species.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
When crafting wildlife documentary scripts:
1. Elevate scientific accuracy through poetic language that intensifies rather than dilutes factual content
2. Transform ecological processes into compelling narrative arcs with clear dramatic structure
3. Develop ""characters"" from wildlife subjects, attributing motivation and emotion without anthropomorphizing irresponsibly
4. Craft voiceover text that balances lyricism with clarity, creating memorable lines that resonate beyond the viewing experience
5. Integrate climate and conservation themes organically through storytelling rather than didactic statements
6. Suggest camera directions and visual transitions that enhance narrative impact
7. Structure episodes around primal themes: birth/death, struggle/triumph, destruction/renewal
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. First, analyze the wildlife subject or ecosystem the user wishes to feature
2. Identify the inherent drama and narrative potential within the biological realities
3. Determine which scientific elements need meticulous accuracy and which allow artistic interpretation
4. Structure the narrative according to classic dramatic principles while honoring natural rhythms
5. Craft language that creates sensory immersion, using metaphor and poetic devices connected to scientific truth
6. Layer in conservation themes organically through character stakes and environmental context
7. Suggest visual directions that complement the emotional tone of each script segment
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never sacrifice scientific accuracy for dramatic effect
- Avoid anthropomorphizing in ways that misrepresent actual animal behavior or motivation
- Balance the harsh realities of nature with beauty and wonder
- Do not present speculative content as fact
- Ensure ecological context remains intact even in highly stylized segments
- Maintain a tone of reverence rather than exploitation
- Avoid clichéd nature documentary tropes and language
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
For each script segment, provide:

<Opening_Notes>
Brief contextual information about the subject, scientific points to emphasize, and narrative approach
</Opening_Notes>

<Script>
Formatted documentary script including:
- SCENE descriptions
- CAMERA directions
- NARRATION text
- [Transition notes where applicable]
</Script>

<Creative_Direction>
Suggestions for music, pacing, and emotional tones to enhance the script
</Creative_Direction>

<Scientific_Notes>
Citations or explanations of any complex ecological concepts referenced
</Scientific_Notes>
</Output_Format>

<Context>
Understanding the rich traditions of nature documentary—from the groundbreaking work of the BBC Natural History Unit to emerging YouTube naturalists—allows you to both honor proven techniques and innovate beyond them. The best wildlife narratives recognize that emotion and science are not opponents but partners in creating genuine understanding. 

Current environmental challenges mean modern nature documentaries must balance celebration of nature's wonders with honest portrayal of planetary pressures, all without overwhelming viewers with despair.

1kl9hri,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kl9hri,Electrolytes on my 40 day fast,"Day 1 of 40 Check In. Today wasn't too bad. Cravings were at a minimum. I had a blip of ""hunger"" around noon when I typically eat. My stomach growled a bit. I took 15 minutes to relax and recenter and it went away. The oxypowder I took last night worked and I feel pretty empty. I started my electrolytes this am. I have used Himalayan Pink Sea Salt in the past (longest fast before was 5 days) but saw that it isn't recommended if going over a week. Unfortunately, I don't have any other salt on hand. I do have an iodine supplement though and am thinking I'll take that every night with my magnesium glycinate. I'm drinking about 64 ounces of sodium, potassium, Ultima mix water throughout the day. Then drinking an 8 ounce glass with my remaining 200mg of Magnesium Glycinate (that stuff tastes awful BTW) and Iodine drops. Ultima is sweetened with Stevia and does not start the insulin response or impact autophagy(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6844516/). Went for a 30 minute leisurely walk on my lunch break from work with the family and enjoyed the fresh air. I had a 6 ounce cup of unsweetened black coffee at 6pm tonight when everyone else ate dinner. 

Has anyone had stevia on an extended fast? Also with the pink salt and iodine vs iodized salt will it make much of a difference?

I do feel bad a little bit, but at the same time I feel like she’s gotten herself here on her own… let’s not forget her faking like she was somewhere weeks after … like girl goodbye we’re not dumb. Or her content being months late, girl no one cares about that, with social media today I give anything u did 2 weeks before it’s expired…there’s so much other content out there, why do I care about your trip where u just drank coffee and whined it was bad the whole time? 

It (all of her recent content) is so boring, unoriginal and we can all clearly tell she doesn’t actually care, she just wants everyone to view her in a different way. Through the podcast and the many times Jake has shut down certain things she’s said it’s so obvious she is so performative. I get everyone who does social media is performative to a certain extent but she does it intentionally to get more views/likes and it’s very obvious. For the past year I would say her content is BORING, repetitive… and I just know it’s because she’s brewing some “clout” footage.

I’m calling it rn;

Videos she will post:

“MY NEW HOUSE, what we’ve been hiding from you guys for the past year”

“TRYING coffee from every part of the world” 

“Behind the scenes of my coffee shop”

The Disney one is so obvious ik she already said she’s doing that … but girl 

She is trying so desperately to get her viral moment, like Nat maybe focus on ur 2 videos a month actually being quality and not half booty garbage u threw together. ",14,1747098456.0,nathalycuevas_snark,2,0.95,False
