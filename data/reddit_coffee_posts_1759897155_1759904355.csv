1o12pgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perimenopause/comments/1o12pgj/the_fan_game_perimenopause/,The fan game perimenopause,"“The Fan Game”
(A Spoken Word Story on the Heat of Perimenopause)

Every morning, I sit at my desk, eight hours deep in the same routine.
It’s me, the keyboard, the coffee, and the fan—
my loyal, temperamental companion in this never-ending game of too hot, too cold.

Click.
The fan hums on, cool air brushing my face like a promise.
For a moment, it’s perfect—
the kind of balance you don’t dare move in, afraid to break it.

But then it shifts.
The chill creeps in, goosebumps rise,
and I turn it off.
Round one—done.
It’ll be back. It always is.

All day, I toggle between comfort and chaos,
trying to focus on my work,
trying not to focus on the furnace living inside my skin.

And when the clock finally releases me,
I go home to a different rhythm—
Dinner sizzling, kids chattering,
the smell of something good in the air,
the warmth of love,
and yet… the sweat.

It begins subtle—
a bead under the arm,
a glisten at the hairline,
the quiet betrayal of a body I used to know.

The kids are bundled in blankets,
complaining about the cold—
but I’m standing in a 68-degree sauna,
shirt clinging,
bra damp,
underboob soaked like I’ve run a marathon in place.

I crack a window.
Crisp autumn air rushes in,
and I sit there like a queen before her wind,
basking in the chill of relief.
For a moment, it feels divine.

Then—
“Mom, it’s freezing!”
I sigh, pull the window just enough to hush them,
leave an inch for my sanity.
I scoot my chair back, chasing the breeze like a cat chasing sunlight.

I sip my wine.
I try to lose myself in the show glowing on my iPad,
but even the laughter on the screen can’t drown out
the slow trickle of sweat down my neck.

I grab a paper towel.
Then another.
And another.
By the time the episode ends,
the pile beside me looks like a battlefield.

Eventually, I give up.
The night’s lost.
I crawl into bed, stripped bare,
fan blasting, no covers,
just me and this inferno in disguise.

It’s not passion.
It’s not pleasure.
It’s perimenopause—
the cruelest kind of comedy.

My joints ache,
my body burns,
my mind spins in circles.
Sleep becomes a mirage—
close enough to see,
too far to reach.

And when it finally comes,
it’s thin, fragile,
like tissue paper wrapped around exhaustion.

Morning comes too soon.
The alarm cuts through my fog,
and I wake—
sweaty, sore,
half-delusional,
but still here.

The cool shower hits my skin,
and I breathe—just breathe—
because today,
I’ll do it all again.

I’ll sit at that desk,
play the fan game,
pretend I’m fine,
and focus hard enough
to forget
that my body’s rewriting its own story—
one hot flash at a time.

1o12mpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BangaloreSocial/comments/1o12mpp/best_budget_food_places_in_bangalore/,Best budget food places in bangalore,"So glad I’m talking about this because honestly, finding good budget food in Bangalore is basically a survival skill when you’re grinding those crazy tech hours. 😄

After 5 years of living here, I’ve found some absolute gems. First up – VV Puram Food Street (also called Thindi Beedi). Dude, this place is insane!

 It’s like a 100-meter stretch full of street vendors serving the most amazing vegetarian food. You can literally eat like a king for under ₹200. The dosas, bajjis, and chaats here are next level. Pro tip: go on a weekend evening when it’s buzzing, the vibe is unreal.

For classic South Indian breakfast, Vidyarthi Bhavan is iconic. Their ghee masala dosa is legendary, and it won’t burn a hole in your pocket. I’ve lost count of how many Saturday mornings I’ve spent here with colleagues, just chilling over crispy dosas and filter coffee.

If you want something slightly fancy but still budget-friendly, check out Truffles in Koramangala. It’s a super popular burger joint that’s always packed with the techie crowd. Their burgers are massive, prices are reasonable (around ₹300-400), and honestly, perfect for team lunch outings.

What I love about Bangalore is you can spend ₹50 on amazing street food or ₹500 on a decent sit-down meal, both equally satisfying.

Always on the lookout for new spots though. What’s your go-to budget place in the city?

My top recommendation would be the banana caramel smoothie paired with a fresh Caesar salad — a perfect combination of flavors.

For fellow food lovers, a brunch for two would typically cost between ₹2,500–₹3,000, and in my opinion, it’s worth every rupee for the experience.

In the last 5 years I’ve drunk every night with the odd night here or there where I COULDNT drink, not so much ‘didn’t’.

The first 3 days were the hardest, and getting through the weekend of beautiful crisp autumn weather, my favourite time of year, pushing the cravings away or distracting them by going for a walk, reading, watching trash tv, it’s been a struggle but I’m so proud of myself that I’ve made it this far. I really didn’t think I could. 

My sleep has been incredible, I’ve been waking up before my alarm and getting up. I used to snooze it until the last possible moment and every morning was a foggy rush full of dread and regret. Here I am sitting quietly ready to jump in the shower with plenty of time, enjoying a coffee. 

I’m so early in my sobriety, I really hope this sticks. I need to remember this feeling. I can’t wait for double digits!

1o12jcy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1o12jcy/im_clinically_diagnosed_for_bipolar_disorder_and/,"I'm clinically diagnosed for bipolar disorder, and I have concerns for caffeine intake to function.","Hi, this is probably not as  important as other questions in this sub, but I just need an expert's take on this.

I (23F) am clinically diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder for 2 years, and although I have taken meds in the previous year, this year I cannot afford insurance and so my doctor and I eased me off medication before I leave until I can afford insurance again. It is alright at first, but lately I've been finding myself unable to properly function as a person. I get irritable, moody, but most of all I start having trouble focusing and completing projects in a timely manner. This is a major issue because I work remote and rely on my own time management, which is deteriorating quickly. I found that drinking coffee in the afternoon helps tremendously with mood and energy, and I have felt focused. However, I know very well the effects of caffeine addiction, and I know this will not last forever as I get used to the caffeine. 

I don't want to rely on caffeine to function, because it is unreliable after a while. I've been taking it only sporadically (I don't take more than 1 cup every 48-72 hours and have to get proper sleep in between cups), but I'm in a pretty high pressure field and require the extra energy more and more often. I've done all the usual fixes the internet usually suggests (exercising regularly, taking B12 vitamins, going to sleep properly, eating proper nutritious food, drinking a glass of water every hour, getting breakfast, establishing a routine, taking breaks, replacing it with green/black tea/matcha). 

When I bring this to my doctors, they laughed and said I was just making a big deal out of caffeine addiction. But as a high school student, I did firsthand research on caffeine addiction and its effects. It's not as detailed as medical students and professionals do of course, but as part of the data gathering, I see firsthand what caffeine consumption looks like in long term, how whole adults cannot function without 3-6 cups of coffee either first thing in the morning or thru the day, and them not seeing an issue with it because it's so normalized. I also consumed a bunch of caffeine during this period from stress, and also saw firsthand what it does to my own body. And above all else, I felt firsthand that the effectiveness will wear down eventually; I experienced the withdrawal in real time as I was writing the paper. I know I'll just be back to square one with ""caffeine addiction"" as an extra ailment. Caffeine was and always will be my last resort because of it.

I'm currently at loss of what to do. I need the extra energy, I don't want to get addicted to caffeine, medication is out of question until I get insurance. What do I do? Is there something I'm doing wrong? Am I wrong at all, about the caffeine addiction part?",1,1759903125.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1o12ggt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Moist_Resist_4011/comments/1o12ggt/top_5_benefits_of_buying_a_home_in_dubai_online/,Top 5 Benefits of Buying a Home in Dubai Online,"Dubai has changed so much in the last few years, and so has the way people buy property here. The city is now one of the biggest real estate hubs in the world, and everyone from locals to foreigners wants to buy a house here. The thing is, you don’t even have to be in Dubai anymore to buy your dream house. With everything online now, you can literally buy a home in Dubai sitting in your living room, sipping coffee.

Not long ago, the idea of [**buying property online**](https://majesticlivingproperties.com) sounded a bit weird or risky. Most people wanted to see the place in person or meet the agent face to face. But now, the process is smoother, safer, and honestly much easier than before. If you are someone thinking about investing or moving to Dubai, here are the top five benefits of buying a home online that you should really know about.

# 1. You can do everything from anywhere

The best part about buying a home in Dubai online is how simple and convenient it’s become. You don’t have to drive around for hours or meet ten different agents. Just open your laptop or phone, and you’ll find hundreds of properties listed with all the details you need.

Websites like Bayut, Property Finder, or Dubizzle show you photos, videos, prices, and even the area map. You can use filters to select what you want – such as price range, number of bedrooms, community, or whether it’s off-plan or ready.

If you live outside the UAE, this is a huge advantage. You can buy a home in Dubai from India, the UK, or literally anywhere, without having to travel. You can shortlist properties, talk to agents on WhatsApp, do video calls, and even finish the deal online. It saves time, travel costs, and all the hassle of running around.

# 2. You get more transparency and real data

Let’s be honest, traditional property buying used to be full of confusion. You never knew if the listing was real, if the price was fair, or if the photos were fake. Online property platforms in Dubai have changed that completely.

Most listings now are verified. That means the portal checks the property and the agent before publishing it. You’ll find real photos, actual prices, and even RERA license numbers. This makes things way more trustworthy.

Plus, you can compare different areas in one go. For example, if you’re not sure whether to buy in Marina or Downtown, you can just look at the price per square foot, amenities, and ROI data on the same page.

The transparency is what gives buyers confidence now. When you buy a home in Dubai through a trusted online platform, you know you’re getting proper information, not just marketing talk.

# 3. Virtual tours make life easy

Another big reason people are buying homes online now is because of virtual tours. You don’t even have to visit the property to see what it looks like. Most developers and brokers offer 360-degree video walkthroughs. Some even do live video calls from the property, showing you around the kitchen, balcony, or pool view while you ask questions.

It’s actually pretty cool. You can check how sunlight hits the living room, how big the bedrooms are, and how the layout looks — all from your screen. This gives you a realistic idea before you decide.

Developers like Emaar and Damac even let you choose your unit, make bookings, and sign documents online. So if you’re sitting in another country, you can still buy a home in Dubai and complete the paperwork digitally.

For busy people or investors who don’t have time to visit each site, virtual tours save a lot of effort and time.

# 4. Online buying is secure and government-backed

Many people still worry that online buying isn’t safe. But in Dubai, that’s not really an issue anymore. The Dubai Land Department (DLD) has made sure everything is regulated and transparent.

They’ve introduced apps like Dubai REST, which let you check ownership details, verify titles, and even register the property online. Payments go through official escrow accounts, which means your money is protected until the sale is complete.

Also, all licensed agents and developers have to be registered under RERA. This reduces the risk of scams or fake listings a lot.

So when you buy a home in Dubai online, as long as it’s through registered agents or official developer websites, your deal is legally protected. It’s actually safer than handing cash or documents to some random broker.

# 5. You get better deals and exclusive offers

Another great part about buying a home online in Dubai is that you can find special online-only offers. Many developers run promotions for digital buyers — like discounts, 0% commission, or flexible payment plans.

Because online listings cut out middlemen and office costs, developers can offer better prices directly to buyers. And since you can see multiple listings at once, it’s easier to compare and negotiate.

For instance, if you’re eyeing a two-bedroom apartment, you can check how much similar ones cost in JVC, Business Bay, or Creek Harbour. This gives you a real edge in bargaining.

Some developers even let you reserve a property online with a small down payment. You can pay a token amount to block the unit, then complete the full payment later. That’s something you can’t usually do through offline brokers.

Online, you’ll also see new off-plan projects before they’re fully launched. If you act early, you can secure units at pre-launch prices — which means better ROI later.

# 6. You learn more about the market while browsing

Here’s one more bonus benefit people don’t think about much. When you buy a home in Dubai online or even browse regularly, you actually start to learn a lot about the market.

All these portals have price trends, community guides, and even rental yield charts. You’ll understand which areas are growing, which ones have higher returns, and what new projects are coming soon.

If you spend some time researching, you can easily spot the best opportunities — maybe a villa in Dubai South that’s undervalued or a waterfront flat in Palm Jebel Ali that’s set to rise in price later.

You also get to read real estate blogs, developer updates, and news articles, so you become a more confident buyer.

Buying a home in Dubai online is no longer just a trend — it’s becoming the new normal. With all the technology, verified platforms, and legal systems in place, it’s safe, simple, and super fast.

For someone who’s living abroad or too busy to do in-person visits, this is a total game-changer. You can explore, compare, verify, and even finalize your deal — all online.

Dubai’s real estate market is still booming, and digital property buying has opened it up to the whole world. Whether you’re looking for a small apartment to live in or a luxury villa as an investment, it’s now easier than ever to buy a home in Dubai online.

It saves time, reduces stress, and helps you make better choices with more information. Plus, it’s kind of exciting to know you can own a piece of one of the world’s most glamorous cities — with just a few clicks.

So if you’ve been thinking about it for a while, maybe don’t wait too long. Open your browser, check out the listings, and who knows — your perfect Dubai home might just be waiting there for you.

The best dating icebreakers matter more than ever because online conversations move at swipe-speed. If you can’t spark instant vibes, you risk getting ghosted before the convo even begins. Think less slow-burn rom-com, more “we click or you’re skipped” energy. **Meme conversation starters** work like a charm these days. 

**Top 5 icebreakers for Gen Z + Examples  -** 

**Pop culture stanning –** When you both obsess over the same character or show, the ice breaks itself. DMs like - Team Conrad? Omg finally someone with taste 👏 can seriously define relationships. 

**Wholesome memes –** Soft energy always wins, it's cute and low-effort. Memes like Bubu Dudu or a sleepy Kuromi could do wonders. **Brainrot humor –** Nothing says soulmates like finishing each other’s “Lalalala / Okokok.” Bonus if you both know the latest trending audios by heart.

**Pick-up lines  –** Not cringe, just clever. Pro tip: Schmooze’s - a meme-based dating app has a built-in AI that helps generate fresh pick-up lines so you don’t embarrass yourself 

**Relatable reels –** Corporate humor, student memes, or just a “Monday got me like…” reel. Trauma bonding is the real flirting in 2025.

**Quick takeaway.**

**Best dating icebreakers in 2025** aren’t about forced charm. They're about shared vibes. These types of icebreakers work because they reflect *you*. Keep it casual, funny, and real. Remember: it’s less about impressing, more about connecting

The **HP Stream 14** continues to dominate the entry-level Windows laptop space in 2025 — not because it’s powerful, but because it’s *purpose-built*. This isn’t trying to compete with high-end ultrabooks. It’s designed for students, remote learners, and light users who want reliability, Office 365 integration, and battery life that doesn’t quit halfway through class.

I’ve tested this model (the **HP Stream 14 N150**) in real academic and work-from-home scenarios — streaming, note-taking, browser multitasking, and cloud-based productivity. For what it costs, it genuinely holds its ground. It’s not for video editors or gamers, but for study sessions, Google Docs, and Zoom calls, it performs far better than most Chromebooks in the same price range.

# Who the HP Stream 14 Is Really For

If you’re a student, freelancer, or parent buying a dependable homework laptop — this one’s built for you. Its biggest advantage is balance: low power draw, quiet operation, and optimized integration with Microsoft’s **Windows 11 S Mode**. It doesn’t slow down easily when handling lightweight multitasking like Spotify, Google Drive, and Word simultaneously.

That said, it’s not built for heavy-duty workloads or creative software. HP clearly targets this as a **cloud-centric device** — meaning most of your workflow lives online, in Office 365, OneDrive, or browser-based platforms.

# 

# Design, Display, and Build Quality

# Portability and Form Factor

At just **3.17 pounds (1.44 kg)**, the HP Stream 14 is easy to carry in any backpack. The polycarbonate shell has a matte finish that resists fingerprints surprisingly well. The build feels solid for a sub-$300 laptop — no flex around the keyboard deck or screen hinge.

One thing HP nailed here is design minimalism. The **14-inch size** sits in the sweet spot — larger than a Chromebook, smaller than a full laptop. It’s ideal for dorm desks, coffee shops, or remote work setups.

Keyboard travel is decent for long typing sessions. I wouldn’t recommend it for professional writers, but for students typing essays or taking notes, it’s comfortable.

# HD BrightView Display and Webcam Experience

The **HD BrightView display** is exactly what you expect at this price — 1366x768 resolution, but surprisingly crisp when you’re viewing documents or streaming Netflix. The colors pop more than you’d think on paper, especially for an LED panel of this tier.

The **720p webcam** performs well for online classes and Zoom. It’s not cinematic, but it handles lighting better than many budget competitors. HP’s built-in **noise reduction mic** adds clarity to voice calls, which makes it genuinely practical for hybrid learning setups.

# Performance, Connectivity, and Real-World Use

# CPU, RAM, and Storage Breakdown

The 2025 **HP Stream 14 N150** ships with an **Intel N4020 processor**, **16GB RAM**, and **288GB combined storage** (64GB internal + 256GB expansion). For basic workflows — Microsoft Word, Edge, Spotify, and Chrome tabs — it runs smoothly.

Here’s the truth: this isn’t a multitasking powerhouse, but HP’s optimization in **Windows 11 S mode** makes performance surprisingly fluid. Boot times are quick, the OS stays responsive, and apps open without lag.

Storage feels limited, but it’s offset by **1TB of free OneDrive storage** (included for a year with Office 365). You’re clearly meant to work in the cloud here.

# Windows 11 S Mode and AI Copilot Integration

HP’s integration with **Windows 11 S Mode** keeps things streamlined and secure. Apps are downloaded only through the Microsoft Store, which dramatically reduces malware risk — a big plus for student environments.

The addition of **Copilot AI integration** (yes, there’s even a dedicated **Copilot key** on newer models) is surprisingly useful. It helps summarize articles, generate quick outlines, and manage browser sessions efficiently. For students juggling assignments, this feels like a real productivity edge.

Switching out of S Mode is optional, but for most users, I wouldn’t bother. It’s lightweight, fast, and you avoid Windows bloat.

# Wi-Fi 6, Docking Station Options, and Everyday Usability

Connectivity is another win here. You get **Wi-Fi 6**, **Bluetooth 5.3**, **HDMI**, **USB-C**, and dual **USB-A** ports. Pair it with an **HP Stream docking station set**, and it can handle dual monitors without choking.

The Wi-Fi 6 chip gives stable performance — I tested it on a 500 Mbps fiber line and maintained over 300 Mbps consistently. That’s impressive for a sub-$300 machine.

If your workflow involves streaming, video calls, or cloud-based editing, you’ll have no issue. Just don’t expect it to crunch through Photoshop or handle 20 Chrome tabs at once.

# Battery Life, Office 365 Integration, and Student Workflow

Battery life is easily one of its biggest selling points. I averaged **10.5 hours** during mixed usage — browsing, writing, and streaming. For classroom days or travel, that’s more than enough.

Every purchase includes a **one-year Office 365 subscription**, meaning full access to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. It’s a perfect match for students who rely on cloud-syncing and document collaboration.

I also like how quiet it runs — fan noise is minimal even under load. For study halls, libraries, or lecture halls, that’s a subtle but important win.

If you’re buying for school or casual work, this setup feels nearly tailor-made. You’ll rarely touch your charger before the day’s over.

# Frequently Asked Questions

# Is the HP Stream 14 good for students or work-from-home tasks?

Yes. It’s optimized for lightweight productivity, cloud work, and Office 365 use. Students, remote workers, and freelancers will find it reliable for daily tasks.

# Can I upgrade the HP Stream 14 RAM or storage?

No, RAM is soldered. Storage can be expanded with a **microSD card** or external SSD via USB 3.0. That’s usually enough for school use.

# How does the HP Stream 14 compare to Chromebook models in the same price range?

It’s more flexible thanks to Windows 11 S mode and Office 365. Chromebooks still boot faster, but the Stream wins on app compatibility and offline productivity.

# Does the HP Stream 14 support Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3?

Yes, the 2025 version does. That’s one of its biggest upgrades over the older N4000 series.

# How does the HP Stream 14 handle multitasking with 16GB RAM?

For web-based tasks and Office apps, perfectly fine. Just don’t push it into photo or video editing — the processor is entry-level.

# What are the limitations of Windows 11 S mode on this laptop?

You can’t install non-Microsoft Store apps without switching to standard Windows. But the trade-off is speed and better security.

# How long does the battery last with typical student use?

Around **10–12 hours** depending on brightness and app usage — genuinely solid for a full day of classes or remote work.",1,1759902280.0,JoanMarketing,0,1.0,False
1o12a5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/BarndosAndCabins/comments/1o12a5x/farmhouse_style_barndominiums_designs_interiors/,Farmhouse Style Barndominiums | Designs & Interiors,"Exploring the Charm of Farmhouse Style Barndominiums: Design Elements and Features
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Farmhouse style barndominiums combine the rustic charm of traditional farmhouses with the modern appeal of barn structures. These unique homes showcase a blend of practical living and inviting aesthetics, attracting many homeowners who desire a lifestyle connected to nature while enjoying contemporary comforts. Let's explore the design elements and features that make these homes so appealing.

### Open Floor Plans

One of the standout features of farmhouse style barndominiums is their open floor plans. This design choice promotes a sense of spaciousness and flow between different areas of the home. Instead of cramped rooms, you’ll find large, airy spaces that weave together the living, dining, and kitchen areas. An open layout is perfect for entertaining and allows families to interact easily while cooking, dining, or relaxing together.

### Rustic Materials

Farmhouse style barndominiums embrace materials that express a rustic integrity. You’ll often see elements such as:

- **Wood Beams:** Exposed wooden beams add character and warmth to the space, emphasizing the natural beauty of the structure.
- **Reclaimed Wood:** Using reclaimed wood for flooring, walls, or accents creates an eco-friendly appeal while contributing to the farmhouse aesthetic.
- **Metal Accents:** Steel and iron elements, whether in stair railings or light fixtures, offer a touch of industrial style complementing the warmth of wood.

### Neutral Color Palettes

A calm and welcoming color palette serves as another defining characteristic. Farmhouse style barndominiums often feature neutral tones, such as whites, creams, and soft grays. These colors create a soothing atmosphere and act as a blank canvas, allowing you to add pops of color through furniture and decor. The use of natural hues fosters a connection to the outdoors and enhances ambient lighting.

### Large Windows

Natural light plays a crucial role in farmhouse style barndominiums. Large windows provide panoramic views of the surrounding landscape and allow sunlight to flood the interior. This feature not only brightens the space but also promotes energy efficiency by reducing the need for artificial lighting during the day. Picture yourself sipping coffee by a big window, looking out onto an open field or a garden—you'll feel connected to nature.

### Cozy Fireplace Features

A farmhouse style barndominium wouldn’t be complete without a cozy fireplace. Whether it’s a traditional wood-burning option or a modern gas unit, the fireplace becomes a focal point within the living area. Imagine curling up with a good book in front of the fire, creating heartfelt memories with family and friends. The warmth and ambiance it provides enhances the overall charm of the home, making it a perfect gathering spot.

### Functional and Stylish Kitchens

Farmhouse kitchens are designed to be both functional and stylish. They often feature:

- **Large Islands:** An expansive kitchen island serves as a food prep area, dining space, and additional storage.
- **Shaker Style Cabinets:** These cabinets maintain a clean aesthetic while offering ample storage for kitchen essentials.
- **Farmhouse Sinks:** A deep apron-front sink not only looks great but also adds practicality when washing dishes or handling large pots.

### Outdoor Living Spaces

Farmhouse style barndominiums often incorporate outdoor living spaces, reflecting the need for a connection with nature. Patios, porches, or decks made of wood or composite materials create a seamless transition between indoor and outdoor areas. These spaces are perfect for barbecues, family gatherings, or simply enjoying a peaceful evening under the stars.

### Personal Touches Through Decor

Decorative elements play a significant role in defining the character of your farmhouse style barndominium. Personal touches can include:

- Wall Art: Family photos or local artwork can infuse personality into your home.
- Textiles: Cozy throws and cushions in natural fabrics can soften the atmosphere.
- Antique Finds: vintage pieces can add a sense of history and charm.

Farmhouse style barndominiums offer a captivating blend of modern and rustic design. With open spaces, natural materials, and thoughtful features, these homes provide an inviting atmosphere for you and your loved ones. Whether you’re building from scratch or renovating an existing structure, embracing the farmhouse aesthetic can create a warm haven that feels just right.

Interior Inspirations for Barndominiums: Blending Rustic and Modern Styles
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to designing your dream barndominium, blending rustic and modern styles can create a stunning interior that feels both homey and chic. Embracing farmhouse aesthetics adds warmth and character while implementing modern touches ensures the space feels fresh and up-to-date. Here are some inspiring ideas to help you create the perfect interior for your barndominium.

### Open Concept Living Spaces

One of the most appealing features of a barndominium is its spacious layout. An open concept design allows for a seamless flow between the living room, dining area, and kitchen, making the space feel larger and more inviting. Consider using large windows to bring in natural light, enhancing the airy atmosphere. This openness is ideal for entertaining and family gatherings.

### Rustic Elements

To add that rustic vibe, incorporate natural materials and textures. Here are some elements that work beautifully in barndominiums:

- **Wood Beams:** Exposed wood beams on ceilings create a traditional farmhouse feel. Stain them in a deep brown or leave them natural for a contemporary twist.
- **Stone Accents:** Use stone for fireplaces, accent walls, or kitchen islands to bring a touch of the outdoors inside.
- **Reclaimed Wood Furnishings:** Furniture made from reclaimed wood adds character and sustainability, giving your space a cozy feel.

### Modern Touches

Balance rustic elements with modern features to make your barndominium feel current. Here are some great modern updates to consider:

- **Sleek Appliances:** Invest in stainless steel or black appliances that contrast nicely with wooden features.
- **Minimalistic Decor:** Choose simple furniture designs that do not overcrowd the space. A few carefully curated items can make a big impact.
- **Neutral Color Palette:** Stick with whites, creams, and soft grays as your base colors, allowing rustic elements to stand out without overwhelming the space.

### Cozy Textiles

Textiles play a significant role in the overall ambiance of your barndominium. Choose fabrics that are both inviting and stylish. Soft wool throws, cotton cushions, and natural fiber rugs can enhance comfort while also supporting your aesthetic. Mixing patterns can add interest; think stripes with florals or checks with solids. Layering different textiles can help you achieve a warm and welcoming feel.

### Nature

Connecting your interior with the surrounding landscape can amplify the peacefulness of a barndominium. Large potted plants or a vertical garden wall can bring a splash of greenery indoors. Choose low-maintenance plants, like succulents or snake plants, which add life without requiring constant attention. Floor-to-ceiling windows not only let in light but offer unobstructed views of nature, bridging the gap between indoor and outdoor spaces.

### Unique Lighting Fixtures

Lighting can dramatically change the mood of a room. Consider using industrial-style pendant lighting or vintage chandeliers that highlight the rustic charm of your space. Dimmer switches also allow you to adjust lighting according to the occasion, making your barndominium feel inviting day or night. Don’t forget natural light—maximize window space to take advantage of sunlight during the day.

### Personal Touches

Your barndominium should reflect your personality. Incorporate art pieces that speak to you, family photos, or items with sentimental value. Unique décor choices, such as hand-painted ceramics or locally sourced art, can elevate your space and tell a story. When you infuse your personal style into your design, it transforms the barndominium into a true home.

Blending rustic and modern styles in your barndominium creates an inviting and gorgeous living space. By thoughtfully considering materials, colors, and design elements, you can achieve a harmonious atmosphere. With these interior inspirations, your barndominium can become the perfect blend of comfort, style, and individuality.

### Conclusion

Embracing the farmhouse style in barndominiums brings a unique charm that seamlessly melds rustic elements with modern living. The design features, such as exposed beams, reclaimed wood, and spacious layouts, create an inviting atmosphere that celebrates simplicity and functionality. These architectural details not only enhance the aesthetic appeal but also reflect a lifestyle that values comfort and practicality.

When it comes to the interiors, the blend of rustic and modern styles offers endless possibilities for creativity. You can curate spaces that switch between cozy and chic, mixing vintage pieces with contemporary accents. Opting for muted color palettes with earthy tones can enhance the rustic feel, while bold decor elements can add a dash of modern flair. Lighting fixtures, furniture choices, and even the layout can play significant roles in creating a harmonious balance between the two styles.

Choosing farmhouse style barndominiums means investing in a living space that tells a story. Each corner can be a reflection of personal style and heritage, merging the charm of the countryside with today’s conveniences. Whether you’re designing a cozy family home or a weekend getaway, these structures promise a warm and inviting environment, perfect for making lasting memories.

With thoughtful design and interior inspirations, your barndominium can become more than just a house—it can be a sanctuary that embodies the spirit of farmhouse living while accommodating the demands of modern life.

1. We've been together for 2 years, I didn't have Insta back then and recently made one months back. This is my first relationship and I have strict parents. They are conservative.
2. I'm young and busy studying mostly, I have like 3 followers and only post when I'm bored (it's basically chill)
3. Bf never posts me/us. Otherwise he's perfect and literally amazing, all his friends and family know of me and we've talked as well (not in person, though)

I don't think he's lying or something, but it irks me in a weird way. His feed is filled with old teenage posts of random school friends, family and even brother's ex.

If I ask him, he says he's outgrown that period of life and my parents might find out (my mom is very strict and saw us talking once, it was bad).

However, he posted a story for his bestfriend (M) from that party. And when we meet, sometimes I take a cute pic where identity isn't visible like just legs and coffee or a flower, but he never posts those either saying they're girly and romantic.

Once, I was about to put our pic on Instagram, but couldn't cause of parents, so he put us in profile pic. However, when I asked him recently how come you don't post us even without identity, he said I did in profile pic when you told me to. But I never told him...I don't even open Insta more than once a week.

In the rabbit hole once again. I am simply looking for the best cup possible, coming from a semi-automatic before, with my next purchase. 

As I understand, the Z10 is pretty much the endgame in jura’s lineup and in the general superautomatic industry. 

But I came across a deal for the GIGA10, which is to my understanding, the same machine, but with dual hoppers/grinders, and a better/bigger touchscreen. Can provide a mix of both grain so pretty nice if I prefer decafs in the afternoon, or half cafs. Bigger screens is always better also, as the user experience becomes better. 

Price difference is about 400$ tax in… So outside of these nice perks, and the size of the machine, anything I might also consider ?

With that kind of money applied to a coffee machine with a « buy it once » mindset, the difference seems to worth it, but I don’t know what I don’t know…. So please share your experience, knowledge and point of view!

Comp is good but is it worth it?,"I started a C-level role for a startup this year because I wanted to increase my income so I can invest even more. It’s fully remote. Base is $250k, bonus is $125k, so total pre-tax cash comp is $375k and equity is 2% (unclear if this will materialize into anything and the vesting is very long term). I think this is decent comp on paper. But I resent my work so much with how many hours I have to work and all the growing pains of this startup that I end up problem solving for on a daily basis. It’s driving me crazy and I’m so unhappy. 

I am investing 50% of my after-tax base salary and likely almost all of my after-tax bonus too other than a few vacations here and there. 

Anyone else in the same situation? How do I deal with this terrible mental space I’m in?

I want to take a lower stress and lower commitment role but will it really be less hours for the potentially high pay cut and lower investing ability?

I talk to some friends and they work a decent amount too and they are 5 days in the office but I from what I’ve sensed, I likely make 2x in cash comp as them. So it’s like what is this balance I’m trying to find and does it even exist? I never want to go back to working in an office. But my remote work looks a little like some days I don’t even get to go outside for a walk with how nonstop it is. I’m essentially the opposite of the remote workers on Instagram reels who are at the beach or coffee shop, or somewhere international.

The only thing that could reset my mental state right now is a month+ off of work with how much burnout I am experiencing and I can’t really do that with how busy we are at work. 

TLDR: I make decent comp but I work so much that I feel underpaid, overworked, and I’m hating life right now. Feeling like this is unsustainable but I like the investing rate I can achieve with these numbers. ",3,1759901394.0,FIREyFemmes,7,0.8,False

# 1. Photographing the Night Sky by Alyn Wallace

This is a stunning book, and it can be enjoyed for the beautiful photography alone. Talk about the perfect ‘coffee table’ book. 

Alyn Wallace is one of the best landscape astrophotographers in the world and someone I am proud to call a personal friend. Alyn reached out for one of my photos of the Heart and Soul Nebula, and I am honored that it made it into the book.

This book, which took Alyn 4 and a half years to complete, is a whopping 570 pages long. It truly is the encyclopedic guide to landscape astrophotography, and I think astrophotographers of all skill levels will enjoy it.

# 2. The Practical Astronomer: Explore the Wonders of the Night Sky by Will Gater

This offers a comprehensive guide to discovering and understanding the solar system and beyond. This was one of the first astrophotography books I purchased and was really motivating for me early on. 

The Practical Astronomer is excellent for aspiring astronomers as well as for beginners. This book is well-presented, easy to follow, and full of information. It is a complete introduction to observing and understanding the night sky.

# 3. Inside PixInsight Book

This book is like a personal mentor for astro-imaging. At first, PixInsight felt super intimidating, but the step-by-step explanations made it click. I learned not just *how* to use the tools, but *why* they work. Some parts were tricky, but seeing my raw images turn into clean, vibrant shots made it so worth it. If you’re serious about astrophotography and patient enough to follow along, this book will seriously level up your skills.

These charts contain stars down to 9th magnitude and over 2,000 deep-sky objects plotted in their correct size and shape, including many nebulae not commonly found in sky atlases.

This book contains many pages with an abundance of useful information on photogenic targets. It is evident that Charles Bracken is very educated and has extensive imaging experience.

This book is an excellent atlas that highlights many key aspects, such as:

* 416 emission nebulae and supernova remnants
* 171 reflection nebulae
* 146 planetary nebulae
* 52 dark nebulae and molecular clouds
* 792 galaxies
* 38 galaxy groups
* 108 globular clusters
* 309 open clusters

The tabular index contains important details on each object, including a description, the best time of year to capture it, and the required field of view.

With information on nearly every possible photographic target in the night sky, The Astrophotography Sky Atlas will help you choose your targets and plan your imaging.

Be sure to also have a look at [The Astrophotography Planner (2020-2021 Edition)](https://amzn.to/3gul9xF). 

  
Although the majority of astrophotography research and education takes place online, sometimes it is nice to have a physical book to read like those above.

This is especially true when using a resource guide such as *Inside PixInsight* or browsing objects in the garage using the *100 Best Astrophotography Targets*. 

All of the astrophotography books on this list can be a valuable resource for you and propel your interest in the hobby further.",2,1759901354.0,pixel_galaxy,0,1.0,False

This is all real,"Every day since i started my job- this is week three/ more and more crazy shit comes out of my bosses mouth. Not only that but … week three and i know nothing lol she doesn’t know process, she hasn’t really explained anything i do , and the company is using printed paper in binders for records. Just gonna start there 

*cue the law and order theme song*
This is my story 

It’s also a transcript from a voice note / so bear with me, the translation isn’t great. But maybe laugh with me , not at me. Or like , that’s fine. Laugh at me And LMK if you’d like to hire a fashion designer to work on your branding. As after this experience, I’m ready to end my 14 year run in this industry and maybe start an anonymous TikTok 

I guess I should just make a whole list of things that my boss says that is pretty unhinged so let's take it from the top first thing that she said to me that was unhinged was that when people make her bleed, she will make sure they bleed out. Bleed out. This is in response to someone who “stole” her designs and booked her a car for the wrong time to go somewhere.. She also is very positive that people are reading her emails and not only reading her emails, but deleting them, deleting her emails. because literally, she thinks people have time for that. And she also thinks that. that people are are stalking her LinkedIn from her other job. Like, she thinks it to be true so much so …. she tried to sue LinkedIn because she thought that they were they were looking at her profile, I guess.. I don't know. I don't know, I don't know. You know? I don't know. Um, yeah. She also told me that her old job put $10,000 in her 401k, because they're trying to get her to come back. And then when I asked her if they had also contacted her and she just wasn't answering, she said no., so like - why would they do that? Ok. next fucking weirdo thing that she did, is that she told me that her fortune teller? Yeah, her fortune teller. Um, her fortune teller tells her things, like, tells her that she's that she's had really bad luck. And, um her bad luck is supposed to end this fall. So I'm apparently at the end of her bad luck, but I have bad news. I am definitely her worst nightmare. She also has a son, and he is 17, and she complains about having to make his lunch every day. At 17, my mom was giving me money for lunch or I was making my own. And she told me that he wants to go to NYU because he just wants to be in New York City, but he's not smart. And then today, she mentioned him again because she said sometimes she forgets that she has a son. She gets home and she forgets she has a son, which is... wild to me. Okay. And then some other unhinged things that she has said is, like, today, every time I was going to ask her question, she got up to make a cup of tea. She must have made six different cups of teas to literally avoid answering my questions. Questions on things of, like, that she should know. Like, I was like, hey, how do I get fabric? We work for a clothing company. There should be a pretty standard process. There is not. She also told me today that we had to do polka dots, and I was like, that's kind of random. Like, where did you get polka dots from? She said she was sitting in her office, in her office, like INSIDE. and she heard a meeting outside, and she heard them say polka dots. Now.. eavesdropping is something that I love. I love listening to conversations. I love overheard New York. I love all of that. But here's the thing. You cannot eavesdrop on a meeting at work and then use it, especially when the meeting had nothing to do with you, nothing to do with your brand. She literally just eavesdropped on someone else's meeting, and was like, ""Oh, we should do that, too.which is the exact thing that she's complaining about, about the guy that she doesn't like. ..,

Which we should also get to. She doesn't like a guy at work, 'cause she says that he stole her ideas, which, like I said, is exactly what she did today. However, for some reason, it's different. And for some reason, she has decided to call him the jerk, in conversation. Within earshot of him. Calls him the jerk. She asked me the other day if I was going to the Christmas party. I don't know how I would know about this. It's December 2nd, she tells me. There has been no info sent so … no. I don’t know. 

But of course there’s reason. Like the other multiple hours she’s spent sitting in my office saying how busy she is , there is of course her favorite motivation. Opportunity to talk about the person she doesn’t like, ""Well, I won't go because the jerk orders all the food. 

I'm sorry. What? 

She also told me that I need to go talk to him, as she doesn’t like him- even though she's a director and he's a director and they are both directors and they should be working together. We are ADULTS. AAND THIS IS WORK. I’ve also told her “this is work. My feelings don’t get involved” to which she replied :

“I like revenge. 😳 “

Right now she needs information on something that he did once before. She won't ask him. She's asking his whole team and then buying them coffees if they listen to her. It is bribery at its finest, and you know what? That's the kind of hustle that I can at least get behind. 

…But she's batshit crazy. And she's also said some pretty other unhinged things, such as the CEO likes pretty white girls in the showroom. She's also told me that his wife is Chinese and has a lot of plastic surgery. 

She's also chosen to not go with certain candidates we have  for the job that we're interviewing for because of what they look like. Also doesn’t read resumes or look at portfolios. Just looks for company names she likes. Not to mention she asked me to interview someone in my first hour of being there. 

My first day. Literally i didn’t even know where the bathroom was. Why am i interviewing people? But also why is she still cc’ing a designer that left and won’t put me on emails- introduced me to two people and then had THEM introduce me to the rest of the office to avoid speaking to the person she calls said “jerk”. As well as telling me that after three years she doesn’t know anyone’s names. 

today, we had a girl come in to meet with the CEO, and her advice to her was literally like unbutton a button and put your hair behind your ears so it doesn't look messy. And like, that's not something that you should be telling anyone. Anyone. Let people present themselves in the way that they feel that they want to present themselves and let the creepy old men deal with it if people don't want to show a little skin. 

Okay? Thanks. yeah.. There is just so many things, 

SO. many things that are unreal that she says.

 she'll come in and talk to me for hours on end and tell me that she's not crazy, which is usually the pretty telltale sign that someone's crazy. And she'll tell me that she doesn't lie. And she'll tell me that if she lies, it's because she forgot. And she says her sister gets mad at her because she forgets a lot. Now, for my own experience, I would go ahead and guess that she doesn't forget at all, and that it is just lies. Every question I ask her is replied to as “ yes and no” that is her answer to every question. 

And so now I've started responding “is it, yes or no, because both of those are not an answer together. Those are contradictory””

The answer is “sorry i have to go make tea, which btw - is not in the kitchen. Because then she would have to pass “the jerks” office. She has a full kitchen set up in her office 

She's also said some things that are interesting. Like she said that there's a guy in tech that she loves. She calls him her work husband. I've never seen them speak more than a couple words to each other. But she said that she and him laugh about how they think that the owner is maybe senile and thinks he's in the club and like puts his hand on girls' backs and stuff because AND I QUOTE “he gets excited. And forgets here he is”

And yes, this is the shit we're dealing with. This is the level that we're dealing with. This is out of control. Yeah, this is insane, 

Also, no HR. how else would this keep happening lol

but I'll just keep coming back here and adding more as I think of it because it is insane. Oh, yeah. Today I actually said to her, like, don't you think it's a little crazy that you asked me to interview someone on my first day? Like, literally, my first day. And then she's still interviewing people for this associate designer position that she's trying to fill and fire the only person who knows what's going on in the line. 

She brought someone in today because she liked her name. And when I was asking her if she looked at people's portfolios, she said, no. And so I said, how are you deciding on who to pick? And she said, I look at the resumes and I see their names and I see the companies that they've been at. And I was like, you know that that could all be a lie? And you need to physically see that someone can do the work. 

She said she bases it on feelings. 

And so I was fighting for one girl because she had a tech pack, which, by the way, I shouldn't be fighting for anyone. This is not somewhere where anyone should work. But she wouldn't see her because she said she had plastic surgery. But then she came in today and she definitely did not have plastic surgery. And she was great and she's actually coming back. 

So there's that. 

She also told me the other day that she's very depressed, that she's 50, that she feels that her life is over, that she hasn't accomplished anything. She's also told me several times that she doesn't like her husband, doesn't know her husband and doesn't know her sister. Whatever the fuck that means. 

But she DOES  know her fortune teller who is $150 an hour for 15 minutes. And he's also on TV, apparently, very famous in Korea. So I will be going on a rabbit hole looking for him now.

My mom 83F is a hermit. If she was a child of this day of this age she would be diagnosed as autistic.  Even when we were  growing up was emotionally distant.  She is extremely private about her life including money and health.  She is very smart and was a leading scientist in microbiology. 

My father has long past. There is 4 children.  I have one sibling (A) who I haven’t seen in years. No issues but no one in the family is close with him. I have an another (B ) who tries to stay close to mom by phone but lives thousands of miles away. I have sibling (C) who lives states away who is a compulsive lier and severe mental issues. I am estranged from this person after 20 years of hell. He runs a successful business and money is not an issue for them.  Then there is me. I’m a stay at home wife.  We do fine financially. . I live close to my mother, her POA and manage her care.  Mostly CNAs to come in and help her with activities of daily living.  

I am moms POA for medical and will be for Finachial  as well. To be frank my mom has the wrong trust an we are just now getting her into the lawyer and changing everything but it’s a mess. There is many different sources of money some with even my  grandparents name on it who died 30+ years ago.  

I was doing a group text every time my mother changed things money wise.  I thought I was doing the right thing.  sibling C then sent a group text saying no one trusts me and eluded to the fact I was abusing my mother financially.  That since I don’t a tone of money she must be giving me her money.  The C said they don’t believe that the trust is divided 4 ways equally.  It is.  Then eluded that when mom can’t speak for herself that the sibling will step in and call APS.  She is very well taken care of.  Heck her cat just got a diabetic pump put in.  Mom is living a good life. A small life but a good one. She wants it that way.  She sits in the sun petting her cat each day and sipping coffee.  Should I stop updating them?  Can the trust company  help with this or the lawyer? My mother is sacred of this sibling.   I have tried to convince my mother to be more open of finances to all the siblings but she is always afraid of confrontation. 

I feel like when I’m updating them that I’m giving them information to sue me later.  I’m not doing anything wrong but also feel like I can’t win.  I just want to take care of my mother and not have to deal with this sibling ever again but I know that isn’t the right way to handle it. What should I do? What professional help do I need.

1. We've been together for 2 years, I didn't have Insta back then and recently made one months back. This is my first relationship and I have strict parents.

3. Bf never posts me/us. Otherwise he's perfect and literally amazing, all his friends and family know of me and we've talked as well (not in person, though)

I don't think he's lying or something, but it irks me in a weird way. His feed is filled with old teenage posts of random school friends, family and even brother's ex.

If I ask him, he says he's outgrown that period of life and my parents might find out (my mom is very strict and saw us talking once, it was bad).

However, he posted a story for his bestfriend (M) from that party. And when we meet, sometimes I take a cute pic where identity isn't visible like just legs and coffee or a flower, but he never posts those either saying they're girly and romantic. 

Once, I was about to put our pic on Instagram, but couldn't cause of parents, so he put us in profile pic. However, when I asked him recently how come you don't post us even without identity, he said I did in profile pic when you told me to. But I never told him...I don't even open Insta more than once a week.

My hobbies include running, baking, reading, and watching true crime. I do have some relatives here, but I’d really like to make new friends and build my own circle.

Chapter 1 

I had a fragile Omega sister who had suffered from depression since childhood. The wolf doctor said she couldn’t withstand any stimulation. 

Consequently, my entire life was switched to “mute mode.” 

To avoid upsetting her, I never dared to laugh or cry at home. I wasn’t even allowed to cry out in pain when I got hurt. 

My parents would always hug me with apologetic looks. “You’re the sensible one, Claire. Lyra’s illness requires the whole family’s effort. You’re healthy and strong. Can you please give in to her a little more?” 

That day, I accidentally knocked over a glass. The loud noise sent my sister into an instant emotional 

meltdown. 

My Alpha father hit me for the first time. “Can’t you be more careful?” he roared. “Do you have to push her 

until she breaks?” 

He shoved me to the floor. my head whipping back against the sharp corner of the table. A sharp, blinding 

pain erupted, and I felt the warm trickle of blood before I saw it. But no one glanced my way. The whole 

family was gathered around my screaming sister. 

I lay on the cold floor, my consciousness slowly fading. 

In their eyes, my sister’s emotional well-being was all that mattered; my own injury was a mere 

inconvenience that could be addressed later. 

But they didn’t know that a brain hemorrhage… waits for no one. 

I lay on the icy floor, a dull throbbing pain radiating from the back of my head. 

Warm blood trickled down my neck, forming a small, dark red puddle on the floor. 

“Can’t you be more careful? Do you have to push her until she breaks?” My father’s furious roar made my 

ears ring. 

The blood flow seemed to intensify. 

On the sofa, my sister Lyra was curled into a ball, hands clamped tightly over her ears, emitting piercing shrieks. “She did it on purpose! She wants to kill me! Make her go away! Away!” 

Mom knelt before her, stroking her back and murmuring comforts. “It’s okay, sweetheart, it’s okay. Mommy’s here. The bad sister is gone!” 

I tried to push myself up, but a wave of dizziness washed over me, sending me crashing back to the ground. 

The edges of my vision began to darken, shadows slowly consuming my awareness. 

“Dad… Mom…” My voice was a faint whisper, barely audible. 

No one turned to look at me. 

My sight grew blurrier. Memories started flashing before my eyes. 

That day I won first place in the STEM competition. I practically ran home with the trophy. 

“Mom, I have great news…” I pushed the door open, bursting with excitement, but before I could finish… 

Mom snatched the trophy from my hands, a panicked look on her face, and quickly hid it in a drawer. 

“Claire, don’t let Lyra see this,” she whispered, her voice low. “You know how seeing you succeed upsets 

her.” 

I stood frozen in the doorway my arm still extended from handing over the trophy, the smile stiff on my

You’re our responsible girl.” Mom patted my hair, her eyes full of guilt. “Lyra’s illness requires the whole family’s effort. You’re healthy and strong. Could you do this for the family and let things slide a bit more?” 

I nodded and went back to my room, choking down the bitterness of unfairness. 

The pool of blood on the floor was spreading. 

My breathing became rapid and shallow. White spots flashed before my eyes. 

“Mom, it hurts!” I stretched out a hand, struggling. 

Mom finally turned her head, frowning. “Claire, stop making a scene. Can’t you see Lyra is unwell? We’ll deal with you later.” 

My sister’s screams intensified. “Make her get out! Throw her out!” 

She grabbed a glass from the coffee table and Hurled it against the wall. Shards flew everywhere. 

Dad immediately rushed over and hugged her, treating her like the most precious thing in the world. 

“Lyra, sweetie, Daddy’s here. It’s okay,” Dad’s voice was unbelievably gentle. “Daddy already sent the bad sister away. No one will hurt you!” 

My fingers feebly scraped across the floor, leaving a faint trail of blood. ",1,1759900968.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

I nodded and went back to my room, choking down the bitterness of unfairness. 

The pool of blood on the floor was spreading. 

My breathing became rapid and shallow. White spots flashed before my eyes. 

“Mom, it hurts!” I stretched out a hand, struggling. 

Mom finally turned her head, frowning. “Claire, stop making a scene. Can’t you see Lyra is unwell? We’ll deal with you later.” 

My sister’s screams intensified. “Make her get out! Throw her out!” 

She grabbed a glass from the coffee table and Hurled it against the wall. Shards flew everywhere. 

Dad immediately rushed over and hugged her, treating her like the most precious thing in the world. 

“Lyra, sweetie, Daddy’s here. It’s okay,” Dad’s voice was unbelievably gentle. “Daddy already sent the bad sister away. No one will hurt you!” 

My fingers feebly scraped across the floor, leaving a faint trail of blood. ",1,1759900963.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1 

I had a fragile Omega sister who had suffered from depression since childhood. The wolf doctor said she couldn’t withstand any stimulation. 

Consequently, my entire life was switched to “mute mode.” 

To avoid upsetting her, I never dared to laugh or cry at home. I wasn’t even allowed to cry out in pain when I got hurt. 

My parents would always hug me with apologetic looks. “You’re the sensible one, Claire. Lyra’s illness requires the whole family’s effort. You’re healthy and strong. Can you please give in to her a little more?” 

That day, I accidentally knocked over a glass. The loud noise sent my sister into an instant emotional 

meltdown. 

My Alpha father hit me for the first time. “Can’t you be more careful?” he roared. “Do you have to push her 

until she breaks?” 

He shoved me to the floor. my head whipping back against the sharp corner of the table. A sharp, blinding 

pain erupted, and I felt the warm trickle of blood before I saw it. But no one glanced my way. The whole 

family was gathered around my screaming sister. 

I lay on the cold floor, my consciousness slowly fading. 

In their eyes, my sister’s emotional well-being was all that mattered; my own injury was a mere 

inconvenience that could be addressed later. 

But they didn’t know that a brain hemorrhage… waits for no one. 

I lay on the icy floor, a dull throbbing pain radiating from the back of my head. 

Warm blood trickled down my neck, forming a small, dark red puddle on the floor. 

“Can’t you be more careful? Do you have to push her until she breaks?” My father’s furious roar made my 

ears ring. 

The blood flow seemed to intensify. 

On the sofa, my sister Lyra was curled into a ball, hands clamped tightly over her ears, emitting piercing shrieks. “She did it on purpose! She wants to kill me! Make her go away! Away!” 

Mom knelt before her, stroking her back and murmuring comforts. “It’s okay, sweetheart, it’s okay. Mommy’s here. The bad sister is gone!” 

I tried to push myself up, but a wave of dizziness washed over me, sending me crashing back to the ground. 

The edges of my vision began to darken, shadows slowly consuming my awareness. 

“Dad… Mom…” My voice was a faint whisper, barely audible. 

No one turned to look at me. 

My sight grew blurrier. Memories started flashing before my eyes. 

That day I won first place in the STEM competition. I practically ran home with the trophy. 

“Mom, I have great news…” I pushed the door open, bursting with excitement, but before I could finish… 

Mom snatched the trophy from my hands, a panicked look on her face, and quickly hid it in a drawer. 

“Claire, don’t let Lyra see this,” she whispered, her voice low. “You know how seeing you succeed upsets 

her.” 

I stood frozen in the doorway my arm still extended from handing over the trophy, the smile stiff on my 

of this is my first championship!” My voice trembled. “The teacher said I could apply for early 

ission….” 

You’re our responsible girl.” Mom patted my hair, her eyes full of guilt. “Lyra’s illness requires the whole family’s effort. You’re healthy and strong. Could you do this for the family and let things slide a bit more?”

I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

1o11x8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/redbull/comments/1o11x8l/red_bull_fucked_up_my_life/,Red Bull fucked up my life,"I have been a moderate addict of Red Bull products for the better part of the last 20 years.

My consumption pattern was to drink between two and three standard cans every day—weekdays and weekends alike. I always hated coffee, and Coke never really managed to keep me awake.

Around the middle of 2017, I began to develop symptoms of unspecific lower back and abdominal pain. These pain patterns kept moving around my body over time. Over the course of the last eight years, I must have visited at least 30 different specialized doctors. I’ve had at least 10 MRIs, 2 CT scans, and undergone six different courses of orthopedic physiotherapy—none of which improved my overall level of pain. Classic pain medications like ibuprofen or aspirin had almost no effect.

Around 2021, some doctors assumed that my pain was mainly psychosomatic, so I also began psychotherapy. It didn’t help at all. My psychiatrist eventually dismissed me after six months because he too concluded that my pain wasn’t primarily psychosomatic.

I had been living with these pain patterns ever since. About eight weeks ago, I developed symptoms of a kidney infection. My urologist examined my kidneys and found some small stones. Naturally, the therapy consisted of drinking lots of water.
Since I suspected that Red Bull might have been a factor in developing the stones, I decided to go cold turkey about seven weeks ago.

The pains I carried with me for the last eight years are basically gone. I still have some minor issues from the moving stones, but they are manageable and nothing compared to the usual back and abdominal pain. I also had severe hip issues that occasionally left me bedridden. Except for some very mild soreness in the areas that used to hurt for years, I now feel essentially healed.

I’m aware that this might be an isolated metabolic issue that I personally developed. But if you feel unwell and are a moderate yet steady consumer of Red Bull or similar energy drinks, just try quitting for a few weeks and see if you get better.

Here is the 5th episode and it will be around the last episode of the first season. It be about when and what exactly caused Tyler to hate Wednesday that he didn’t show her any mercy at all and went on obeying Thronhill.


Tyler is still confined in his cage especially after what happened outside during his free time.

Fairburn comes to Tyler.

Fairburn: What do you want to tell me Galphin, make it quick!

Tyler: Whoa, what's this tone? What about being gentle...

Fairburn: Especially what you did yesterday the gentle way won't work for Hydes like you.

Tyler: I am ready to talk about everything Laurel did. Whatever I know I am willing to tell you. 

Fairburn: The sudden change of heart? Any reason behind it?

Tyler: I want to make a deal.

Fairburn: I am not going to send you outside unchained and without shocks anymore!

Tyler: Nope. I don't want that. I want something else. I have 2 demands:

Fairburn: Go on.

Tyler: I want a book to read about Hydes. When I hyde out I had no idea what to do. This is basic rights.

Fairburn: You think we will pass a Hyde guide on how to make it more dangerous?

Tyler: You really think I am capable of causing damage especially with such security and the way my limbs have been chained and my neck is strangled with unpredictable waves of shock!

Fairburn: Tell me the truth! What do you want the book for?

Tyler: I am feeling strange and unusual. It's something both mentally and physically. It's hard to explain. I need to know what's happening with me. Something is wrong with me!

Fairburn: (concerned) This is why, talk with us. Maybe we can help.

Tyler: Maybe? There is no guarantee you can. I am just asking for a book about Hydes. It won't make much difference if you think about it. Laurel Gates already unleashed my full potential as a Hyde. You are my psychiatrist you are supposed to understand me.

Fairburn: Weren't you the one who killed Kinbott?

Kinbott: Kinbott died because of Laurel's orders but now she is not here to give me orders. I have no reason to kill you!

Fairburn: (sighs) What is your second demand?

Tyler: I want to meet Wednesday Addams.

Fairburn: You really think she will come here to meet you, especially after you had a role in almost killing her and her friends?

Tyler: Look I can tell you everything Laurel did. Think about it. And Hydes can change their mind fast. So quick!

Fairburn: Lucky for you Wednesday has applied for permission to meet you. I have gotten permission from the court. It's up to her whether she will meet you or not.

Tyler: (smiling) I am not surprised. I will take the 2nd part of the deal as a yes.

Fairburn: So now let's get going Galphin. Tell me everything you know. Tell me how Wednesday Addams found out your truth and whatever Laurel Gates did! Whatever you know of.

Tyler: How about my book?

Fairburn: That will take time to arrive. I will let my assistant Judi know.

Tyler: Okay fine.

Tyler recalls how he thought about the kiss between him and Wednesday and how she ran away right after that. He was working in the cafe.

Tyler: (in his mind) It was going so good. Such a beautiful moment and we just started our relationship. Why did Wednesday run away like that?

As Tyler ended his shift he found Laurel waiting for her.  Tyler tried to ignore her but Laurel grabbed him by his arms and made him sit in her car.

Laurel: Tyler, now listen to Mama carefully.

Tyler: I already killed Kinbott. What else do you want from me?

Laurel: Tyler I noticed you have been distant from me. Especially after going to my house. What happened?

Tyler: I found that you preserved parts of the dead bodies of the victims I killed. So this is why you became my master, so you can get people killed and then you can do some black magic?!

Laurel: It's not black magic! It's for the sake of humanity whatever I am doing!
I am collecting body parts to resurrect Joseph Crackstone. This is the only way for revenge for victims like your mother and my brother.

Tyler: Whatever it is I do not want to be a part of it.

Laurel: What caused the sudden change of heart?

Tyler: Wednesday Addams. I am in love with her. I cannot betray her like this.

Laurel starts laughing like an evil maniac.

Laurel: I was such a fool! I should have seen this coming when you saved her at the festival, and you even risked your own life when she went to my house. You really think Wednesday Addams will accept you after she finds out you are a Hyde? The monster that killed people in Jericho and harmed one of her friends.

Tyler: Wednesday will understand my situation. Only she will understand.

Laurel: You are being delusional Galphin. 

Tyler: I have a request. Please do not contact me.

Laurel: You will regret your decision Tyler. I don't have to order you, you yourself will come to me willing to help. Remember one thing no one will accept you, the way I did. Once Wednesday finds out, you will come begging to me wanting to kill her!

Tyler leaves the car angrily.

He went home and lay down. He thinks a lot about whether he should tell Wednesday or not. Should he pretend he was never a Hyde? Should he tell her the truth? But what if it becomes dangerous?

Just then Tyler gets a message from Wednesday via Thing. He was relieved to see Thing alright after the injury. Thing runs as soon as Tyler takes the note.

Wednesday: Meet me outside Crackstone's crypt at 8pm.

Tyler smiled seeing a message. He was indeed thinking too much.

It was night.
Tyler went outside Crackstone's crypt and waited for Wednesday. It was a chilling night. After some time, Wednesday comes there.

Tyler: Thing gave me your note. I was surprised you wanted to see me again after you ran out the other night. So uh, is this a date?

Wednesday: It's a surprise.

Tyler chukles and comes close to her for a kiss but she walks away from him.

Wednesday: When I came to Nevermore, romance was the last thing on my mind. 

He looked at her.

Wednesday: But when you kissed me, you opened my eyes and suddenly it all made sense.

Tyler got thinking. He did not like where this was going.

Wednesday: Xavier warned me about you, but I didn't listen.

He did not like it whenever she spoke in Xavier's favour. It was one of his trigger points. 

Tyler: Ironic now, huh?

Wednesday: Ironic would be framing Xavier for murder and the real Hyde helped me put him away.

Tyler's smile changed into a frown.

Tyler: Wait you don't think I am -

Wednesday: (interrupts) I don't think. I know. Kinbott probably discovered your secret during one of your sessions and unlocked you. I thought Hydes were typically loyal to their master. Why did you kill her?

Tyler: Wednesday, seriously this is nuts!

Wednesday tells him how on Outreach Day, he knew she would be going and the Hyde turned out to be there. Then during the Rave'N dance how he heard her and Eugene discussing the woods and he warned Kinbott. And then Eugene saw her torching it so she sent him to clean up the mess. 

Wednesday: I have to hand it to you Tyler, wounding yourself at the Gates mansion, that was a master stroke of misdirection.

Tyler: Okay stop! Do you know how insane you are sounding right now?! I'm not the monster. And if you think I was, why would you risk bringing me to the woods alone?!

Wednesday: Who said I was alone?

As Tyler looked behind he saw some of the outcast students coming there. He could sense there were sirens including Bianca, a gorgon -  Enid's boyfriend Ajax and a vampire.



Tyler: Okay, I don't know what kind of sick joke you are playing Wednesday but I am out of here.

Bianca: Actually...you're coming with us.

It was her siren that got him influenced and he went with Wednesday and the gang.

He heard a snap and then he opened his eyes and found himself chained. It was almost like when Laurel chained him for the first time when he supposedly hyded out.

He then looked at all the drawings of his monster version. His eyes started to water. The truth had to be out eventually.

He looked in front and found Wednesday.

Wednesday: Welcome back!

Tyler: Where am I?

Wednesday: Where someone can not hear your screams.

Tyler: What's with the chains?

Wednesday: Don't ask stupid questions.

Tyler: (lying) Wednesday, that's crazy! I am a normie.

Wednesday: That's the half-truth.

Wednesday showed a picture of the fencing team of Nevermore that included his mother.



Wednesday: Recognise her? Had I not been so distracted by my own mother hogging the photo I would have recognized yours earlier. Your father fell in love and married an outcast.

Tyler: Fine, my mom was an outcast. That doesn't make me a monster.

Wednesday showed him how he got his mother's reports via Thing and that her postpartum depression triggered the Hyde in her.

Tyler: My mom had severe bipolar disorder.

Wednesday: We both know that's a lie. Your mom was a Hyde. And your dad was living in dread unsure if she passed on her condition to you!

Whatever Wednesday said hurt him. It was the truth but he didn't expect her to expose him like that in front of everyone.

Tyler: Are you all going to stand there and let her do this to me?!

Ajax: Uh guys?! Enid just texted. Thronhill is suspicious.

Tyler started thinking that what Thronhill/Laurel said was turning out to be true. 

Ajax: How long until he morphs into that thing?

Tyler: I'm not a monster!

Wednesday: You are. I saw it in a vision in Weathervane.

Tyler: Wait you are basing all this off a vision you had after we kissed? I mean that's something you can trust?

Wednesday takes out a knife.

Bianca: Wednesday what are you doing?

Wednesday: Just some light torture. Don't worry I won't leave a mark.

She was preparing a hammer too. Tyler could get flashbacks it was similar to how Laurel did it but worse!

Bianca: Wednesday hold on?!

Ajax: Are you serious?

Wednesday: (brings up the shock generator) There is only one thing a Hyde can understand. Pain.



Wednesday points the shock generator at Tyler's neck and he screams and cries in pain due to the shock.

Even Wednesday's friends found that too much and they left not supporting what she just did!

Bianca: Wednesday, I did not sign up for this. You are on your own!

He was afraid of Wednesday, the very girl he loves, or he used to.

Tyler: (crying) No, don't leave me here with her, please! I am begging you!

He breathed heavily and hurtfully looked at Wednesday who had 2 shock generators on each of her hands ready to give him more pain.

He was always concerned about what would happen if Wednesday found out the truth but he never expected she would react this way. Does that mean whatever happened between them never meant much to her?! Out of everyone, she was the last person he thought would torture him after knowing everything. He could not have been more wrong.

Wednesday:  What is Kinbott or should I say Laurel Gates using you for?

Tyler really didn't want her to know. He did not want to hate her. He did not want the Hyde in him to harm her, and that would happen if he started hating her.

Tyler: (helpless) Wednesday, please...

Wednesday: Tyler, the body parts in the basement of the Gates Mansion what was she collecting them for?

Tyler: I don't understand. Why are you doing this?

He saw her picking up the hammer. It was just getting worse. Slowly his love for her was being overpowered by hate.

Wednesday: Let's test your reflexes!

Just then the police including Tyler's dad turn up.

Donovan: Get away from my son! Drop it! Drop it.

Wednesday drops the hammer and surrenders.

It was at the Sheriff's department. Tyler's father decided to let Wednesday go as she did help him to catch Xavier the presumed Hyde, even though if he wanted he could have pressed kidnapping charges.

Tyler signed the agreement to let Wednesday go and he heard his father and Wednesday arguing.

Donovan: Get out.

Wednesday walked out.

Tyler: We..Wednesday wait.

Wednesday stopped.

Donovan: Tyler! No no, what are you doing?!

Tyler: I need to talk to her Dad! She was my friend. We are in a police station. What's gonna happen?

Donovan looked at Wednesday and then Tyler.

Donovan: Make it quick.

He leaves.

Tyler walks close to Wednesday.

Wednesday: What do you want?

Tyler: To ask a question. What does it feel like?

Wednesday: What does what feel like?

Tyler's expression changes as he smiles evilly.

Tyler: To lose.

Wednesday looked at him shocked as this was her first time seeing his dark side in open except for the time he hyded out to save her.

Tyler: You know at first, I would wake up naked, covered in blood, no idea what happened.

He still recalls how he found himself chained and naked covered in blood.
 
Tyler: But over time, I started to remember everything. The sound of their screams, the pain in their eyes and the fear so primal I could taste.

He then recalls how he often killed people in his Hyde form.

Tyler: And it was delicious!

He came close to her ears and whispered to her.

Tyler: You have no idea what's coming!



His expression changed to a depressed and helpless one. And he walked away sadly looking down as she stood there hurt and shocked.



Tyler sat in his car alone and he started crying. He did not expect to be this wrong! The one person he hoped would accept him and not use him, is hell bent to get him caught! He knows he did wrong, but whatever moments they had together, did not matter to her.

Tyler then recalls how Laurel said Wednesday's family was behind his mother's death. And then how Laurel told him he would regret and come to her himself wanted to kill Wednesday. 

Tyler then smirked and the Hyde personality completely overtook him without transforming. He took out the phone and looked at Laurel's contact. There was no point being the good boy anymore.

Tyler: Where are you? I am ready to help you.

Laurel: That's my boy!

Tyler goes to meet Laurel. 

Laurel: See I was right. You did come back to me.

Tyler: Tell me what you want me to do?

Laurel: Finally it's time. It's time to kill Wednesday Addams.

Tyler smirks.

Laurel: Finally you will get revenge for your mother's death.  Tomorrow I will take my revenge as I will resurrect Joseph Crackstone with the body parts. For that, I needed a living Addams blood because it was Goody Addams who killed Joseph Crackstone. With that blood, we can complete the ritual.

Tyler: Tell me if I have to suck her blood. I will do it as much as I can.

They both laugh evilly. 

The next day,
Laurel instructs Tyler to wait for instructions and do what she says. Tyler obeys her. He was hell-determined to end Wednesday at any cost! Seeing her dead will satisfy him.

It was evening. Just before Laurel's showtime Tyler waited outside the car.

Laurel messages Tyler to come to Crackstone's Crypt.

Tyler walks in and he sees Wednesday chained up and hanging. She was unconscious and there was blood on her left cheek rolling.

Just 2 days ago this was the very girl he was in love with and kissed. And now he hates her with all his heart. It satisfied him to see her like this.

Laurel: We almost got caught. That Principal Weems shapeshifted as you and pretended you were on Wednesday's side.
(laughs evilly)

Tyler looked on. Tyler told himself that if Wednesday trusted him and accepted him, he would have actually been on her side. But too bad she didn't.

Laurel: I thought you really were on Wednesday's side because of your 'love' for her. 

Tyler: Where is Weems then?

Laurel: I dealt with her by jabbing her with poison and by now she must be taken to hell. Now I am going to be out for a while. Watch Wednesday carefully.

Laurel goes.

Tyler stares at Wednesday who is unconscious. He walked around her.



Tyler: You know Wednesday the first time I saw you at Weathervane I didn't know who you were. You were some goth girl that I found likeable. Your mesmerizing way of talking! (touching her face) I knew I had to protect you.

Tyler: I killed Rowan who tried to kill you. I still do not regret it... Laurel told me to look out for you, so I became friends with you. But I despised it whenever I saw you with that long-haired artist Psychic - Xavier. You are either mine or nobody's. If I weren't on order I would have Hyde out and killed that Xavier.

Tyler then walked around.

Tyler: Gradually, I started to be closer to you. Forgetting about Laurel's orders I was developing feelings for you. At one point, I considered disobeying my master only for you, even if it could cost my life! What did you say, a masterstroke for misdirection! (chukles) It was a stroke to protect you, my love!

Tyler: To be sure you would be there for me, I brought you on a date and I thought you would. But I could not have been more wrong. When we kissed...

Tyler comes close to Wednesday almost as close as they were when they kissed. Tears drop from his eyes.

Tyler: That was a moment I cherished. I used to. You completely made me forget the Hyde in me in that moment. I wanted to keep you forever. But then your stupid visions ruined everything!

Tyler moves away. 

Tyler: You know you were right about one thing! Hydes understand one thing and that is pain. The moment you tortured me, the pain you inflicted on me, I hated you. You gave me more pain than Laurel did. Laurel was a bitch but you?! You gave me shocks the thing I feared the most. That moment you proved you just acted to be dark, but in actual you were like everyone else! It didn't matter to you if I was dead, did it?! (screaming)

Tyler: That is when you killed the little goodness Tyler Galphin had! I have to thank you for that because that was what was stopping me from fully obeying my master!

Tyler looked at Wednesday as she slowly opened her eyes. She looked at him with hate.

Tyler: Kind of a deja vu thing, huh?!

Wednesday: Except I won't cry and whine like a child!



Laurel: Tyler, go and wait by the boat!

Wednesday: Yes, listen to your master and be a good little Hyde.

Tyler looked at her and left purposely pushing her.

Tyler waited by the boat. He then recalled his moments with Wednesday. How she fixed the coffee machine, and then her choosing him over Xavier. How she said she would have taken the prank further and accepted his bullying act for Xavier. 
And then how she nursed his wounds when he slashed himself, their date and then their kiss. And then finally how she tortured him.

Tyler: How do I stop thinking about her?! Why the hell did I go soft for her!!

Just then Laurel messages Tyler.

Laurel: Mission successful. Joseph Crackstone is resurrected and he has stabbed and killed Wednesday Addams. Our revenge is complete!

Tyler stared at the phone for some time. Tears escaped from his eyes. He smiled, tried to. He laughed like an evil maniac but tears were rolling from his eyes too and then he wailed like a baby.

He got out of the car and he breathed heavily. He told himself.

Tyler: What have I done! Wednesday...

Tyler walked in the woods and then he saw Wednesday alive!

He came to her.

Tyler: Laurel said you were dead!

Was he dreaming? Or was it her soul haunting him?

Wednesday: I am feeling much better now.

He smiles for a moment and then he recalls he's on order and he aims to kill Wednesday no matter what! 

Tyler: You are like a cockroach!

Tyler comes close to her, angrily.

Wednesday: Please flattery will get you nowhere.

He holds her by her collar close to him desperate to get rid of her for once and all.

Wednesday: This will not end well for you!

The Hyde in Tyler triggers and he transforms from human to a monster completely, and it was the first time Wednesday saw him transforming.

The Hyde roared at her, giving Wednesday jumpscares. He held her by her neck and pinned her to the tree. Just the way Rowan did it. The other time he protected her this time he will be the one to end her off, the task incomplete by Rowan.



As he goes to slash her, he gets attacked. This time by a werewolf. It was a female werewolf with pink hair.



Wednesday: Enid?

Werewolf Enid barked at Hyde Tyler and they both had a showdown. They fought with each other determined to finish off each other.

Wednesday ran to the school.

They both fought for a long time unwilling to give up. He finally got hold of the werewolf and is determined to finish her off but just then he feels gunshots in his body and then he falls.

Tyler opened his eyes and found himself chained and being taken somewhere in a van. He tries to Hyde out in anger till he gets shock.



Tyler gets out of his flashback.

Tyler: I have told everything that I know. I will be waiting for my book.

Fairburn went speechless at whatever she heard and just walked away.

Tyler: Told you no one can handle me! 

Tyler sat down and his evil expressions suddenly changed to a sad and helpless person. He slowly lay in bed and cried himself to sleep.

End of Episode.

We are halfway to the end of this FF. 5 more episodes to go. These next 5 episode will revolve around Season 2 and also a bit on the time skips. Next episode will be entirely about Season 2 Part 1 since Tyler had limited screen space there.",4,1759900745.0,weyler,0,1.0,False

1o11tff,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1o11tff/learning_to_live_after_losing_my_husband/,Learning to Live After Losing My Husband,"Hi everyone,
I’m 55 years old, and I lost my husband, Bal, just this past May. We were married for 32 years. Last September, my children, some relatives, and I celebrated his birthday together—it was bittersweet but comforting to honor his memory that way.

Life has felt quieter and heavier since he passed. There are still days when I expect to hear his voice or feel his presence beside me.

Some days I manage to go through my routine—morning prayer, coffee, visiting my daughter and my three grandchildren in the province, or making candles and watering my plants at home. On those days, I find small bits of peace. But other days, the emptiness hits hard, and I just sit in silence, missing him deeply.

What’s been helping me lately is holding on to my faith, joining early morning prayer with friends, serving in my church ministry, and allowing myself to cry when I need to. I’ve also found comfort in reading others’ stories here—it reminds me that I’m not alone in this journey.

I’m learning that grief doesn’t disappear; it simply softens as love takes new forms. If anyone here has found ways to cope with the loneliness or the quiet moments, I’d love to hear how you’re getting through them too.

Sending love and strength to everyone walking through grief. ",3,1759900501.0,GriefSupport,1,1.0,False

Last night I pulled an all nighter writing my essay for English and finish my AP bio group project. 

Anyway in the morning I got a Trenta Black iced coffee from Starbucks and the whole day I was like shaking and couldn’t focus on anything. I didn’t eat anything bc I thought the caffeine was enough.

I got to practice and I felt rlly tired but like im always tired so I just continued to run. We were doing 6 sets of 2 laps around the track. I kept pushing myself on every lap but I was slower than my usual pace and every time we took our 2 minute standing rest, I kept like almost tripping over bc and I couldn’t rlly walk or run straight. I told my coach I didn’t feel good and I left to get water. I was lowkey struggling to go downstairs cause I felt like I was gonna kind of fall. Anyway so I got back and barely finished the workout.

My coach kept like asking me if I was okay and it would make me so mad like YES im just dizzy it’s not that deep!! He was like “you should go to the nurse blah blah blah” like bro come on

I don’t want the rest of my teammates to think I was like overreacting or whatever bc I really wasn’t I seriously didn’t feel good and the last time I ate anything was the day before. All my teammates are younger than me like most are sophomores and the rest are freshman and I want to be like there role model or older sister yk not someone to make fun of or think is an attention seeker. They definitely think I was doing it for attention.

like its pretty indistinguishable from reality with certain prompts already like a video of grimes doing an interview liek this, or grimes in a car with Katseye kpop members , and you have to specificaly name what clothing brands theyd be wearing mixed together, because then youd actually create something new, putting sora2 to work in the fashion ai art world. and thats right up grimes alley. ya know grimes as a harry potter character with elon as malfoy would be theraputic i feel. then her magic wand shit morphs into player of games. wow justa sking sora to MAKE new player of games but mixed WITH kill v maim, to update her older videos, wow i really hope someone tries all these prompts and ses what sort of grimes ai music video can NOW be created IF you actuyally ask it to remake older grimes music videos.

1o11qaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeTree/comments/1o11qaq/102_big_bang/,10.2 Big Bang,"One afternoon, I suddenly felt a stomach-ache and suspected that Dufferin gang (hostile forces) wanted to kill me and instruct my colleagues to poison my coffee. I went to the police station to report the case, but the police looked at me while I was talking; there is no record, no response. I left the police station and wanted to go to the hospital, but I knew that I would have to wait for more than ten hours to see a doctor in the hospital, which was unbearable, so I went home.

I have been thinking about what happened between me and Troupe Leader Liu, and I think he has not come to tease me since 2004. I have linked together the story of the entire Chapter 2 ""Peach Flower Catastrophe"" (note, but I have not yet recalled the events of Chapters 1 to 3), and I think I have figured out the eight words “Former Generation’s Marriage Factors, Predetermining Fate”. I have always been fascinated by the Buddhist “intelligence of not seeing the top” (i.e. God's Eye), but I didn't expect Troupe Leader Liu to use it on me. I feel like a beast. He is so old and dying of illness. He repeatedly asked people to send me messages to visit him, but I was like a donkey, indifferent, self-inflicted sin, not deserving to live!

**10.2-1 Ileus**

Suddenly, I felt my internal organs moving, and “ill air” were running all over my body. I had practiced meditation when I was a child (see chapter 12), so I didn't find this kind of tactile hallucination strange, but the scale and intensity of the “ill air” shocked me. I quickly lay down on the bed to avoid fainting fall.

I felt a diaphragm section appear under my chest (as shown in Illustration 10.2.1-A), with no air circulation and gastrointestinal tract movement (note, this is called intestinal obstruction in modern medicine). I immediately adjusted my breathing and drove “True Air” down along the Ren Mai to impact the middle section. As soon as the “True Air” touched the section, the section collapsed. Soon, the “Ill Air” reshaped and reorganized, blocking the chest (about the Shan Zhong acupoint, commonly known as the middle Dantian). I continued to adjust my breathing and used the Qi (i.e., True Air) down along the Ren Mai to impact the heavy and cold evil Qi (i.e., Ill Air) blocking my chest. After a few minutes, I opened the Ren Mai, my body and the peristalsis of stomach returned to normal. After I calmed down, I thought to myself: I have never experienced such a temporary palpitation before; I can't let my imagination run wild!

**10.2-2 Big Bang**

After a while, I stopped caring about what happened and started to blame myself again: I am a piece of shit, this is not what a human being does. Suddenly, I felt something moving all over my body, and I quickly lay flat on the bed. My flesh was slightly bumpy and pulsating. The bumpy and pulsating phenomenon was a little more severe. From the Ming Men acupoint (the two kidneys in the lower back), a feeling of electric arcs was emitted along the skin surface, spreading like water ripples; the two arcs collided in the front abdomen. Then, there were multiple large and small electric circles all over my body, which were wrapped around my limbs and my entire body, moving up and down, just like a CT scan, but I was experiencing multiple electric circles moving up and down to scan my body. There were multiple small electric circles moving up and down on my two arms and two legs. Suddenly, Qi (i.e., Air) surged from all parts of my body, accompanied by electric currents, and gathered towards Dantian (as shown in illustration 10.2.1-B) at a speed several times faster than the countdown. After gathering in Dantian, it immediately exploded. With the explosion, the fragmented Qi (i.e., air) spread to all parts of my body.

I thought happily: Oh my! Big explosion, all sutras (i.e., the lines in the acupuncture chart, see figs. 10.2.1) are shaken open! When I was a child, I read the description of this phenomenon in a meditation book, that all the sutras will be opened. However, what was happening was different from the legend. After a few seconds, the whole body, including the flesh on my face, had a clear bumpy up and down phenomenon, like the boiling water surface; my whole body was boiling and vibrating. I said to myself: ""Calm down! Keep calm! Don't panic!"" The bumpy and jumping phenomenon of the whole body continued for a few seconds, and gradually subsided. At this time, I was lying flat on the bed, paying attention to the abnormal movements of various parts of my body.

The air that was scattered all over the body became cool, and as it flowed, it gathered in hundreds of small areas, accompanied by the feeling of electric current, coldness, and uneven beating of diseased air (or evil air). I realized that this was not a good phenomenon! It was not the comfortable and cool feeling described in the book. I felt that dozens of large vagal rheumatic airs did not go through the sutras, but went straight to my heart, gathering as they moved. Some vagal rheumatic airs moved very fast, for example, centimeters per second.

I immediately became nervous. If the vagal rheumatic air invaded the heart, and the heart is a mass of muscle, if it trembled strangely like this, wouldn't it be a myocardial infarction!? I was having a Heart Attack! When I was a child, I heard my grandmother talk about these many times. Once she was angry and fell asleep under the shade of a tree outside. Between half asleep and half awake, she felt as if a stream of air entered her heart. From then on, she suffered from heart disease.

I immediately took action to protect my heart, ignoring other organs. I began to use my “true air” to attack the “vagal rheumatic air” that was close to my heart and moved quickly. Fortunately, those “evil airs” were very fragile, and they dispersed once they were touched by my “true air”. In a short period of time, I defeated more than a dozen “vagal rheumatic air” groups. At this time, I found that several major rheumatic airs moved slowly, and most of the rheumatic airs did not move. I calmed down.

**Note 10.2.2**

Illustration 10.2.1-2 originated from ancient Mexico, indicating that ancient American had a similar theory of “true air” (i.e. acupuncture and meditation theory; cf. chapter 12) as Chinese. Illustration 10.2.1-4 is the coffin cover of Lord Pacal (aka. Gold Boy, Tlaloc, Jaguar) in the seventh century CE, depicting the cause and effect of his falling into hell. The upper part of the picture shows a cross or “philosopher-stone sword” inserted into his abdomen, indicating that he was crucified, was critically ill. At the bottom of the picture, his lion head is in a fire box, indicating that King Pakal fell into the ""fire path"" (i.e. hell, mental illness). Above the fire box is his godfather's coffin, indicating that King Pakal was sent to hell by the information that ""his godfather had passed away"". The coffin is empty, leaving only three pieces of residue left after the corpse exploded (i.e. three pieces of Buddha's bones, human bones), indicating that King Pakal's body exploded after hearing the news of his godfather's death, so he fell into hell, that is, he suffered from mental illness. The coffin is shown with an ejaculating penis that can lift the coffin, indicating that King Pakal's de facto marriage with Chalchiuhtlicue (aka. Jade Girl) is the right way to cure his illness and save him from hell.

**10.2-3 I surrendered.**

I was confused about what Troupe Leader Liu had done to me; but the conflict between me and him was that I disagreed with his decision that ""I, Luyan, is Eve Liu's husband"" (cf. v. 8.2 ""Die with Eyes Open""). I had very little “true air” left (note, gathering and transporting “true air” requires a lot of physical strength and time), but my whole body was full of rheumatism. I was already facing death, surrendered.

I knelt on the bed and swore: ""Eve Liu is my wife; Troupe Leader Liu is my father-in-law; I will pursue her and marry her."" I kept muttering: ""Eve Liu's father is my father-in-law; Eve Liu is my wife."" I know that oaths have a strong control over people's thoughts. Mumbling out loud like this helps me concentrate my thoughts and energy and is very helpful in preventing loose consciousness from conflicting and destroying my main consciousness and eliminating psychological contradictions.

I found the acupuncture sutra map I collected. The “true air” will move faster, smoother and stronger in the sutras. I first planned the route of “true air” flow on the sutra map, the shortest and most powerful angle to hit the rheumatism, then used “true air” to attack the rheumatism. After breaking up a few more clusters of rheumatism, I found that the vagal rheumatism moved slower. I moved “true air” along the “Shou Shao Yin heart sutra” (as shown in Figure 10.2.1-C), wrapped my heart with “true airs”. In this way, the weak vagal rheumatism would not have the opportunity to get close to my heart.

At this time, I thought that I must eat well, sleep well, and stay healthy to fight against the vagal rheumatism in my body. If my physical health deteriorated, I might develop rheumatic heart disease at some point, and I would become a disabled person even if I didn't die. I said goodbye to my wife and children, but I didn't say it clearly, they didn't understand. I was afraid that I didn't know to protect my heart in my dreams, so before going to bed, I took a hot bath to balance the body temperature and reduce dreaming. I lay in bed, regulating my breathing and concentrating my intention, then extinguished the preconscious and handed over the control of the mind and body to the unconscious (anciently known as God-sense; reference case 1.4.2 Well-Sun Difficulty). The Buddhist scriptures say that in this state, people have extremely strong healing power, equivalent to Gods and Buddhas.

**Note 10.2.3**

The symptoms described in the previous three sections are called Conversion Disorder in modern medicine (as shown in Figure 10.2.3-1), which is a rare mental illness. In the process of fighting rheumatism in the following years, I continued to study and now believe that this disease is caused by this. I have been in awe of Troupe Leader Liu since I was a child and wanted to worship him as my teacher (a yearning that I don’t even know myself). In Chapter 8, after meeting Eve Liu, I had a deep “Gratitude Resentment Love and Hatred” relationship with Troupe Leader Liu. Subsequently, my “Gratitude Resentment Love and Hatred” relationship with Troupe Leader Liu continued to develop for another six years, but I never met him, so in my mind he was a ball of white mist. The mist is the “Present Quantity” (see 11.4.5 Sense Node), representing Troupe Leader Liu, and is the object of my attachment to all my feelings and memories of Troupe Leader Liu. When I realized that he had passed away, this information was received by my unconsciousness (anciently known as God-sense), the ball of mist disappeared, because the unconscious only processes “Present Quantity”, and Troupe Leader Liu is no longer the “Present Quantity”. In this way, all my feelings and memories towards Troupe Leader Liu lost their attachment, which caused great confusion and resulted in the ""conversion disorder"" mentioned above.

The illness described in the previous three sections is an extreme form of Hysteria (anciently known as Ghost Illness), called the Holy Ghost. Illustration 10.2.3-2 is from ancient Mexico and is a Tlaloc (Gold Boy) who was in hell. The top of the statue is the ancient Mexican representation of the Holy Ghost. On the front of the statue, the Holy Ghost is attacking Tlaloc with many penises representing vagal rheumatism. The penises represent that the cause of vagal rheumatism in Tlaloc is his marriage dispute with Chalchiuhtlicue (Jade Girl). Illustration 10.2.3-3 is the “Philosopher-Stone Pestle” in Buddhism; the top of (4), (8), and (9) are sculptures representing the Holy Ghost. The essence of the Holy Ghost is shame; in front of Troupe Leader Liu, I always feel ashamed and am a sinner.

The first three sections describe the phenomena of the ""Die with Eyes Open"" curse erupting in me. Later I found that it had the same meaning as the ""three unforgivable curses"" mentioned by Westerners. I learned that the three unforgivable curses mentioned by Westerners, ""Avada Kedavra, Imperius, and Cruciatus”, are exactly the descriptions of the phenomena caused by the “Die with Eyes Open”.

Love the podcast by the way, didn't think I would be here to share something of my own. I 26 female work for a pretty decent company and have a close relationship with almost all my coworkers. Like any other place you'll have those people who aren't very nice? i guess that's the word i can find. This particular coworker, idk his age but definitely 60+ Male, has a tendency to just say whatever whenever and he doesn't really think about the consequences that may come with it. So just over a month ago, I lost my extremely close first cousin, we grew up together with a lot of other first cousins all in the same home. This obviously had me broken and I still cry every other night when i think about him.

The day i returned to work it was 2 days after we had buried him, This coworker said to me ""oh, so you just got back from holiday"", being blindsided by this comment and just cooling down i asked him if he knew why i was gone? Since if he didn't know then that would have been fine and would just explain why i was gone. He said he did know and giggled, i said ""So burying my brother is a holiday to you?"" (since we grew up together we all consider each other brother/sisters), he said ""it was still a holiday though"". Now, I'm not too quick to get mad and it would take A LOT to build me up, but when it comes to those i love you better be ready, because he's not all that bad of a person he just doesn't know to watch his mouth, i gave him a warning to never say that to me again or i would without a doubt have no remorse for what my hands and steel cap boots will come into contact with, all though it much colorful language.

Today we were all speaking about how we are surprised there's not any violence around our workplace since it is quiet safe and I just mentioned that I was close to it last month with him and he said ""yeah because you were on holiday"".... So i threw by hot food at him and was close to throwing coffee on him until my supervisor stopped me. So now I'm at home wishing i threw that coffee and just got in trouble, because at least i would have left satisfied. I have now told my other first cousins in our group chat and they are fuming, they are suggesting things i should do, especially to his car which cause minor inconvenience, not things soo far as to damage it, they are also asking if they can do it on my behalf since he was all our brother and we feel trampled on. Part of me feels maybe i should let it go, but he not only insulted me and my family, he did it 3 times, ignored my warning and disrespected my brother who's passed on.

Would i be the AH? Should i let this slide and just hate him? He is bound to say something to make me want to fight him another day.....I'm not too sure what to do, i know it's probably my own fault for bringing it up again, but does that make it right for him to still say to me it was a holiday? BTW if i told my boss they would do absolutely nothing about it except maybe ""don't do that again"", literally impossible to get any punishment here so i should have thrown the coffee. If you have any advice, i would very much appreciate it.",2,1759900162.0,TwoHotTakes,3,1.0,False

**10.1 News of Liu’s Death**

In May 2011, I went to work in the laboratory of Golder Associates Inc. Golder is a publicly traded international geotechnical engineering firm. I only worked in the lab, not went to the job site, had little contact with people. The lab manager, Mary, had a long name that I couldn't spell. When I was interviewed, she agreed to let me call her Mary. She was from a country I didn't know where. She explained again; I still couldn't figure it out, so I was too embarrassed to ask again. After working for a while, I realized that people called her Maria, Mario, or whatever, and again asked what I should call her. She replied that that was how it was in her life; different people called her different names and got used to it. I often observe her. She is a standard, strong white woman of European descent. She behaves in a dignified and proper manner, has a traditional Western worldview, a leisurely personality, no local accent, and no ethnic or regional characteristics. I cannot analyze where she is from.

The first two months were fine, but at work, I met people and business from Davroc and Dufferin, and gradually my schizophrenia worsened. I had conflicts with my colleagues, and I became more and more worried about the black society. Eve Liu studied soul reincarnation and hired black society people. If those mafias failed to get tasks done, lost face, or someone lost their composure, there might be murders.

**10.1-2**

One day during a coffee break, I listened to my colleagues chatting. Afterwards, for some reason, I recalled Mary's talk about the video she watched in the meeting. Eve Liu answered the person sent by Sal Fasullo to investigate me: ""Luyan's psychological social environment is different from others. When he was a graduate student, the person he shared a room with was arranged by my father. They lied to him together; he believed it.""

The investigator asked, ""Where is your father now?""

Eve Liu replied, ""Dead! What my father did has nothing to do with me. I was not in China at that time, I was in the United States studying for my doctorate!""

The investigator asked, ""Then why didn't you tell Luyan?""

Eve Liu replied, ""My dad said that Luyan was very stubborn. If he didn't see it with his own eyes, he wouldn't believe anyone who told him, so he could only think about it when others chattered next to him or people on the road chattered, and he heard it. Little by little, he figured it out, and then he was fine.""

The investigator asked, ""What did your father want Luyan to do?""

Eve Liu replied, ""He said that I had no husband in my life, and that no one else would do except Luyan. He said that I am not his daughter and Luyan is his son. He then wanted me to marry Luyan. My dad said he can't see me marry Luyan, he dies with eyes open. You see! I am not superstitious and don't believe in this.""

After I recalled what Marry said, felt strange: If this was something I had thought about before, and imagination was confused with reality, then there shouldn't be something I didn't know. I recalled the story of ""Peach Flower Catastrophe"" in Chapter 2 of this book, which my mother told me. She didn't remember the eight words “Former Generation’s Marriage Factors, Predetermining Fate”. So where did Mary's eight words come from (Note 2)!? And Mary spoke English; her word usage was completely different from my English verbal habits. I recalled and analyzed that Troupe Leader Liu had not done anything to me for five or six years, thought he was dead.

I thought that Troupe Leader Liu had really passed away a long time ago. I was in a very bad mood and seemed to be sick for two or three days. I suspected that Eve Liu bribed my wife and entrusted someone to take care of my children. I always found that they were changing.

Note 10.1-2, after the environment is formed, the related language will appear. In the previous chapter 2, when I was two years old, I didn’t understand such words and I had very little memory, but now there is a related environment, so the words pop up.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

The chair keeps the shape you left.  
The bed leans toward a vanished weight.   
The doorknob holds the heat of a last decision.
The bath runs hot enough to summon a face; steam writes what the mirror will not keep.  
A coffee ring dries into a small brown halo. Paperbacks bow where a thumb once paused between sentences.  
The window seam keeps our weather like a thin scar.  
The thermostat favors your weather, teaching the walls you’re late, not gone.  
The glass learned my name and would not give back a face.  
Pride polished silence and called it mercy.
Keys in my pocket rehearsed leaving.  
The door knew which way the weather would go.  
I keep the cup: I rinse the ring.  
I keep the key: I drop the mask.  
I keep the door: I lose the myth.  
If the room warms without a word, that’s truth showing.  
What we were once fed a black rose till it opened for the night.  
Now shadow blooms in a vase of air.  
Comfort visits while the words are mine, then thins when I press “post.”  
The city sells single use vows: I keep the ordinary warm.

Yesterday I was playing truth or dare with my three buddies since I've known since Highschool, and eventually they found out during a Truth of mine that I had a huge crush on a girl named Stefany in middle school. And they know that I was pretty much a simp for her and she and the whole school knew about my crush. But I was of course out of her league since she was one of the popular girls and I was a loser tbh.

They then dared me to contact Stefany, and when I told them I never got her number, they told me to message her through Facebook since we were friends there. 

I was nervous and didn't want to do it, but then again I didn't want to lose the game and have to pay for the pizza. So I texted her and luckily she never responded when I was with them.

Just about an hour ago she texted me back and responded to me. She just Hey how's its going? I tried to act cool but for some reason I was getting nervous, even though its been ages and I've grown since then.

I told her that I saw photo of her in the middle school yearbook and wondering what she been up to. She told me that she was just finishing up college, and then we had a talk about what we were majoring in.

Eventually she said she had to log off for the day, but she would be willing to get some coffee with me in the morning. When she said this my heart was racing, and when I told my friends they just kept teasing me and told me to say yes to her.

Of course I would love to say yes, but Im so skeptical. She really wanted to meet me that easily, we weren't even friends in middle school just acquantices. And whenever I did run into her in the halls she would always tease me, her and her friends. I don't know whether I should go get coffee with her or not.

TLDR : Messaged my middle school crush because of a dare, eventually she responded and we texted and now she wants to meet up for coffee. Don't know what to do.",0,1759899802.0,makemychoice,7,0.5,False

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I am his first girlfriend and basically his first everything if you know what i mean.. I’ve had 2 boyfriends before him but the relationships were shorter than 3 months and we did nothing but kiss.

Now, this boy is one tear younger than me. We are at a music school together. I’m 18, he’s 17. Since he is one year younger than me he is in a different class and in this class there is this girl…let’s call her Emma. Emma is that type of girl that is so naturally pretty, attractive, godly beautiful, literally perfectly built. Blonde, blue eyes, tall and a very very good singer. Nick and Emma know each other since they were 11. They have got through difficult times together, with their family situations that are similar: drunk fathers, beaten mothers and just conflicts. They have always been there for each other. He also had a crush on her from grade 5 to 7. He used to have her contact in his phone by “emma<33” 😐 They got presents for each other for Christmas, i mean not ordinary presents but expensive perfumes and stuff.

I met him in may 2024. We have chatted for a little bit (like 2 weeks), then we fell for each other and  poof-  relationship. I have asked hum about this girl because i had such a strong gut feeling that there is something off about nick and emma, but he told me that there is nothing going on between them so i trusted him. Now they remained friends on social media, she sends him memes on tiktok and he does too. They sit next to each others in class, sometimes go to coffee together (with another classmate too). I started to get pretty mad about this. Don’t get me wrong, he is very affectionate with me and told me that he does not have any feelings for her but i just feel that this is not the truth. For example, something that really pisses me off so bad and i told him about this too is this: whenever she gets huge news she calls him. For example, she went to the preselections to this big national competition for singing. She signed a confidentiality contract  to not tell anyone informations or “spoilers” about the show and guess what she did. She called nick and told him right after she found out and it was also during an important recital for me🫥

After talking with him about this and telling him that i am not ok with all of this bs, and told him straight in the face that im gonna break up with him if i catch him sitting next to her in class again, guess what he did today? - he sat next to her, and his excuse was that the only choice he had was the first bench in class that is basically nearest point to the teacher. He always uses this stupidd excuse.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

So I did some research and found a 3D-print pattern for a 2-cup sized dosing ring and stand. I asked my friend to print this for me:  
  
[https://www.printables.com/model/322064-2-cup-moka-pot-stand-and-funnel-for-bialetti-moka-](https://www.printables.com/model/322064-2-cup-moka-pot-stand-and-funnel-for-bialetti-moka-)  
  
Except when I received it the hole for the stand was too narrow for the basket funnel stem. So I asked him to make the stand have a 1.5cm diameter hole, and he made another stand for me with the adjusted dimensions. It was quite inexpensive and I am very happy with the dosing ring and funnel as I now no longer spill coffee grounds on the counter when I make coffee first thing in the morning (and am not yet fully awake). If you do use the pattern above, please check the diameter of the basket funnel stem and discuss with your friendly 3D printer before having it printed.   ",4,1759899374.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

1o11g1g,https://i.redd.it/i71w0feujttf1.png,Meet Heather Lane,"**Headline: Captivating Eyes, Adventurous Spirit: Ready for a Deep Connection and Shared Journeys.**

Hi there, I’m Heather. You might be drawn in by my eyes in my photo, but I promise there’s a whole lot more to me than meets the lens! I’m a woman who approaches life with a blend of confidence, curiosity, and an unshakeable belief in the power of genuine connection. I believe in living authentically, embracing challenges, and finding beauty in both the grandest gestures and the simplest moments. I'm often told I have a strong presence, which I like to think comes from being truly passionate about what I do and who I am.

Professionally, I channel my creativity and eye for detail as a freelance Art Director. It’s a role that allows me to combine my aesthetic sensibilities with strategic thinking, bringing concepts to life for various brands and campaigns. I thrive in dynamic environments where innovation is key, and I genuinely love the process of turning an abstract idea into something tangible and impactful. It keeps my mind sharp, my imagination flowing, and gives me the freedom to pursue other passions outside of work.

Beyond my career, my world is rich with diverse interests. My love for aesthetics extends deeply into my personal life. I'm a frequent visitor to art galleries, finding endless inspiration in different forms of expression, from classical masterpieces to edgy contemporary installations. I also have a keen interest in photography and design, often losing myself for hours in independent bookstores, flipping through monographs or architectural guides. I appreciate the beauty in thoughtful design, whether it's in fashion, interiors, or even the perfect plating of a gourmet meal.

But don't let the appreciation for refined tastes fool you – I'm equally at home letting my hair down and seeking out exhilarating experiences. You’ll often find me exploring new cities, whether it’s a spontaneous weekend trip to uncover hidden gems in a charming town or a more meticulously planned adventure abroad to immerse myself in a completely different culture. I’m a big believer in collecting experiences over possessions, and I crave those moments of discovery – from savoring street food in an unfamiliar market to hiking a trail with breathtaking views. I love live music, from the soulful rhythms of jazz to the raw energy of an indie rock band in a intimate venue. Fitness and well-being are also important to me; I enjoy staying active, whether it’s through a challenging Pilates class, a brisk walk through a scenic park, or even just dancing the night away.

Friends would describe me as loyal, fiercely independent, and someone who always speaks her mind, but with kindness. I value honesty, integrity, and a witty sense of humor above all else. I believe true connection comes from being vulnerable and authentic, and I’m always striving to grow and learn, both individually and within my relationships. I appreciate a partner who is emotionally intelligent, can engage in thought-provoking conversations, and isn't afraid to challenge me (gently, of course!).

What am I looking for in a partner? I'm hoping to find someone who shares my zest for life and my appreciation for both depth and adventure. I'm drawn to confident, intelligent men who have a strong sense of self and purpose. Someone who is kind, respectful, and knows how to truly listen. A great sense of humor is non-negotiable – laughter is my favorite sound, and I believe it's essential for navigating life's ups and downs. I’m seeking a true partnership, built on mutual respect, open communication, shared passions, and a desire to support each other's dreams. Whether it's exploring a new corner of the world together, having deep conversations over a delicious meal, or simply enjoying a quiet, cozy evening in, I want to build a life filled with shared joy and unwavering connection.

My ideal first date is something that allows for genuine conversation and a natural flow. Perhaps an evening visit to a museum or art installation, followed by drinks at a unique cocktail bar with a great atmosphere. Or maybe exploring a farmers market or a charming neighborhood together, grabbing coffee, and seeing where the day takes us. I believe the best connections are sparked when two people can truly be themselves and find common ground while also celebrating their differences.

If you’re a passionate, intellectually curious man with a kind heart, a sense of adventure, and you’re ready to delve into a meaningful relationship, I’d love to hear from you. Tell me about an experience that fundamentally changed your perspective, or the last exhibition or concert that truly captivated you. Let's see if our paths are meant to intertwine.",1,1759899210.0,issheai,0,1.0,False
1o11ftl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nitc/comments/1o11ftl/purpose_of_human_life_and_civilization_nayena/,purpose of human life and civilization - Nayena,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",2,1759899189.0,nitc,0,1.0,False

1o11dhy,https://i.redd.it/20ylrvt5jttf1.jpeg,Meet Jenny Well,"**Sunshine Seeker with a Zest for Life, Looking for My Equally Vibrant Adventure Partner!**

Hi there, I’m Jenny! If you’re reading this, you’re probably wondering a little about the person behind the smile, and I’m genuinely excited to share a glimpse into my world. I’m a firm believer in living life to the fullest, embracing every sunrise with a sense of optimism and a readiness for whatever beautiful experiences come my way. I’ve often been described as radiant, warm, and someone who finds joy in both the grand adventures and the quiet, cherished moments. My philosophy is pretty simple: collect moments, not things (though a beautifully designed outfit or a unique piece of jewelry always brings a little spark!).

By day, I channel my creativity and strategic thinking as a Marketing Director for a growing tech company. It’s a role I love because it challenges me, allows me to innovate, and keeps me constantly learning in a fast-paced environment. I thrive on collaborating with talented people and bringing exciting ideas to life. But when the laptop closes, my adventurous spirit truly takes flight. You’ll often find me planning my next getaway, whether it’s a spontaneous weekend trip to a charming coastal town to discover local artisan shops, or a meticulously planned international excursion to immerse myself in a new culture. There’s something truly invigorating about exploring unfamiliar streets, savoring exotic flavors from street food to Michelin-starred dining, and discovering hidden gems. I live for those moments where the world opens up, reminding me how vast and wonderful it truly is, and how much more there is to see and experience.

Beyond my professional life and my love for travel, I’m deeply passionate about connecting with people on a meaningful level. I thrive on engaging conversations – the kind that spark new ideas, make you laugh until your sides ache, or simply offer a comforting sense of understanding and connection. I’m a loyal friend, a supportive family member, and someone who always tries to see the best in others. My interests are pretty varied; one day I might be perfecting a new, complex recipe in the kitchen, the next I'm exploring a contemporary art gallery, or finding my zen in a dynamic yoga class. I also confess to a love for a beautifully crafted cocktail at sunset and getting lost in a captivating book on a quiet evening. Maintaining a healthy and balanced lifestyle is important to me, which means I appreciate both an invigorating hike through nature and a relaxing spa day designed for rejuvenation. My personal style reflects my personality – confident, elegant, and always ready for a good time. I believe that presenting your best self is a form of self-respect, and it brings me joy to express myself through fashion.

What am I seeking in a partner? I’m looking for someone who shares my enthusiasm for life, who is kind, intelligent, and possesses a genuinely good heart. A great sense of humor is absolutely non-negotiable; laughter is my favorite sound, and I believe it's the glue that holds everything together. I’m attracted to ambition, not just in career, but in life – someone who is always striving to be their best self and isn't afraid to chase their dreams. Emotional maturity, open communication, and mutual respect are foundational for me. I’m hoping to find a true partner, someone who can be my best friend, my confidant, and my biggest cheerleader. Someone who isn’t afraid of a deep, committed connection, and who sees the beauty in building a life together, filled with shared experiences and unwavering support. Whether it's exploring a new city hand-in-hand, sharing stories over a delicious meal, or simply enjoying a quiet night in with a movie and a cozy blanket, I want to experience it all with the right person by my side.

My ideal date isn't necessarily about grand gestures (though those are lovely too!). It's about genuine connection and shared discovery. Perhaps we could start with a leisurely coffee or a walk in a beautiful park, allowing for easy conversation to flow naturally. Or maybe exploring a new part of town that neither of us has visited before, finding a cozy spot for dinner, and discovering common interests and passions as the evening unfolds. I believe the best connections are built on shared laughter, genuine curiosity, and a mutual desire to truly get to know one another, rather than just going through the motions. If you're someone who values kindness, adventure, and meaningful conversations, and you're ready to embark on a beautiful journey together, I'd love to hear from you.

So, if you’re a passionate, driven individual with a kind spirit and an adventurous heart, send me a message! Tell me about the most unforgettable trip you’ve ever taken and what made it so special. I’m excited to discover if our paths are meant to intertwine. Let’s create some amazing stories together.",2,1759898972.0,issheai,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1759898886.0,GMAT_INDIA,0,1.0,False

1o11ahf,https://i.redd.it/fxsc2rvdittf1.jpeg,BlueTokai/Instamart appreciation post,"I ran out of coffee beans yesterday- the most unimaginable horror to a caffeine and coffee addict. The ones I ordered are still on their way even after planning my deliveries to a T.


So what do you do when you want espresso and not be depresso?


Because if you go to a cafe or a retail outlet, chances are you will only get fresh roasts or only get old roasts- the good rested ones are generally gone. And I, among other people, have had bad experience with ordering whole beans from instant grocery delivery platforms like Instamart: sometimes they’re overly fresh and sometimes they’re overly stale. 


This time, however, the beans delivered to me yesterday were absolutely right on time- 15 days rested- the best time for starting using beans for medium roast espressos in my opinion. Things just fall into place some days.


I did not pick up any of the flavour notes mentioned on the pack though, however… I recently changed my OPV spring in my GCP to a 9 bar spring and the machine may still be dialling in or maybe I just suck… who knows, who knows… I got my much needed caffeine dose yesterday without any bitterness (Americano)- I was happy.

1o118uj,https://i.redd.it/yn5gj3sshttf1.jpeg,Kenna Stone in The Tides Between Them,"The sky was the color of soft gold when Alina stepped onto the beach that morning. Waves lapped gently at the shore, and the air smelled like salt and sunlight. She had always loved early mornings by the sea — they felt like a promise that the day could become anything.

She spread her towel near the dunes, dropped her bag, and stood for a moment, letting the breeze tangle her hair. She was lost in the quiet rhythm of the water when she heard a voice behind her.

“Hey — are you planning to steal my spot again?”

She turned to see the same face she’d seen almost every morning that summer — a tall, easygoing stranger with sunburned cheeks and a surfboard tucked under one arm.

“Oh, please,” she said, laughing. “If I remember right, *you* were the one who stole my perfect sunrise view last week.”

He grinned. “Then I guess this makes us even.”

And just like that, another morning turned into a conversation.

They began meeting without meaning to. At first, it was coincidence — both of them drawn to the same quiet stretch of sand before the tourists arrived. Then it became routine — two towels, two cups of coffee, and endless conversations about everything and nothing.

His name was Theo. He was a marine biology student who’d grown up by the coast and could name every type of shell scattered along the shore. Alina worked as a photographer, chasing light and color wherever she could find them.

“You see beauty,” he told her one morning as she snapped pictures of a tide pool.  
“And you understand it,” she replied. “That’s why we get along.”

As the weeks passed, they learned each other’s rhythms. She was impulsive, full of energy and laughter. He was patient, thoughtful, grounding her when she drifted too far into her dreams. Together, they balanced each other — like the sea and the shore, constantly meeting, parting, and finding one another again.

When the weather turned colder, they traded the beach for coffee shops. On rainy days, Theo would bring her shells he’d found, each with a story. “This one’s from a storm tide,” he’d say, placing it in her palm. “You can tell by the smooth edge.”

Alina kept them all in a jar by her window.

One evening, near the end of summer, the two of them sat on the pier, watching the horizon melt into pink. The waves beneath them shimmered with reflected light.

“I don’t want this to end,” Alina said quietly.

Theo looked at her, the corners of his mouth lifting. “It doesn’t have to.”

“I mean… the mornings, the talks, the calm,” she said. “I’ve never met someone who feels like home before.”

He smiled softly. “Then maybe this isn’t about endings. Maybe we just found the part of our lives that keeps going — no matter where we are.”

She rested her head on his shoulder, and for a while, neither spoke. The sea moved around them, eternal and forgiving, carrying their laughter into the wind.

Years later, when they looked back on that summer, they couldn’t quite remember when strangers became friends — only that it happened gently, like the tide rising without you noticing.

Because sometimes, the best kind of love isn’t the one that begins with fireworks or confession. It’s the quiet kind — the kind that grows in trust, shared silence, and sunlight.

The kind that never has to be named to be real.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

That’s the first thing I remind myselfwhen the memories crawl back at night,when my brain starts stitching togethera timeline that never officially began.

We never dated,yet you were everywhere.In my mornings,in my midnight calls,in my half-written texts I never sentbecause I didn’t want to seem too much.Funny how I became too muchfor someone who never even called me theirs.

We never dated,but you told me you loved me.You said it softly,like you didn’t want the words to make noise,as if love whispered was somehow saferthan love said out loud.I believed you anyway.I always did.

We never dated,but you knew how I liked my coffee,what side of the bed I slept on,how my voice cracked when I was tired.You knew me in wayspeople who date for years never learn.

We never dated,but I spent a weekend at your housepretending the world outside didn’t exist.I fell asleep in your arms,woke up to your lips brushing mine,the kind of closeness that makes promiseswithout saying a word.

We never dated,but we were exclusive,like love on mute,quiet enough to deny,loud enough to destroy me.
And so I’m left here,trying to grieve somethingthat technically never happened.
How do you mourn an almost?
How do you bury a maybe?
How do you explain the acheof losing someoneyou were never allowed to claim?

I replay it all like evidence in a trial,searching for proof that it was real.Every memory a clue,every silence a verdict.
But the story collapses on itself,
a puzzle missing too many pieces,a book with chapters ripped out.
Still, 
I read it over and over,hoping the ending will change.
Because it feels like a breakup,even though there was nothing to break.It feels like loss,even though there was nothing to lose.And I hate that I still measure my daysby how long it’s beensince we last spoke.

We never dated.That’s what I tell people when they ask,and I smile like I’m fine.
But inside,I’m still untangling us,the love that wasn’t supposed to count,the goodbye that was never said.

*Where Tennis Meets Tomfoolery*

---

**Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game**  
Let’s cut through the noise with some cold, hard math. Liudmila Samsonova is the slight favorite at decimal odds of **1.61** (implied probability: \~62%), while Sofia Kenin sits at **2.25** (\~44%). But here’s the rub: those numbers ignore the *psychological warfare* Kenin wields. Samsonova’s odds suggest she’s the “safe” pick, but Kenin’s head-to-head dominance (2-0, including a 2023 straight-sets thrashing) adds a layer of *mental Mayhem* that stats alone can’t quantify.

Both players are hard-court journeymen, but their records read like a bad breakup text: “We’ve tried, but neither of us can beat anyone ranked top 40 lately.” Samsonova’s 4-5 mark and Kenin’s 4-6 ledger over the past three months scream, “Please, just let us find our rhythm!” Yet Kenin’s recent first-round survival—saving **two match points** against Anastasia Zakharova—proves she’s the tennis equivalent of a cat with nine lives. Samsonova, meanwhile, eked out her win over Emiliana Arango by converting 4 of 11 break points, which is like acing a math test by guessing every answer.

---

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Grit, and Glorious Chaos**  
Samsonova’s path to Round 2 was a nail-biter. She served just **one ace** and committed **three double faults** against Arango—a performance so erratic, it makes a yo-yo look stable. Yet she rallied from a break point deficit in the second set, proving she’s got the heart of a warrior and the serve of a person who forgot their coffee.

Kenin, though, is the real-life protagonist of this story. Her first-round match was a three-set thriller where she saved two match points in the second-set tiebreak and closed the door in the third. If you’ve ever w

Yesterday, had my first colonoscopy, no prep instructions were sent so I got to wing drinking the goop thanks to the internet and family who’ve had the procedure. I woke up several times during the procedure (I can’t go into details, it’s been a traumatic 48 hours) only to leave with a stack of papers that included my diagnosis and names of meds… which were not ordered properly and I had to wait an extra day for.

So, I’m piecing together that I’m in the midst of a flare and will be on 2 meds for the next 30 days, including nightly enemas.

Aside from feeling completely neglected by the GI clinic, I am terrified. Is this as good as life gets now? Have you been happy in remission? I realize how different we all are, so what works for one may not work for another, I’m massively overwhelmed about what to put in my body.

Let’s say I’m in remission. How frequently do flares arise? Do I need to be worried about stealing a fry from someone’s plate or having a cup of coffee? Are you able to enjoy yourself in moderation, or do you find yourself adhering to a strict diet?

I’m not a huge drinker but enjoy cocktails socially, love my AM coffee, am already dairy free and try to eat well. I occasionally have sweets or snacks like chips, though lately fruit or veggies and hummus are a go-to. Can I have a slice of my birthday cake in a few months, or have a “comfort” meal every now and then? 

Also of note, this is the third autoimmune disease I’ve been diagnosed with, in addition to migraine, anxiety/depression, and chronic sinusitis. I can’t help but feel this inflammation is all linked.

He is amazing, does his very best to support me after he comes back home after work. We did not anticipate that it would feel this lonely. I am on maternity leave currently.

1o115w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/firstmarathon/comments/1o115w4/first_one_done_milwaukee_lakefront_marathon/,First One Done (Milwaukee Lakefront Marathon),"**TL;DR:**  
Ran my first marathon — the **Milwaukee Lakefront Marathon** on **October 5** — finishing in **3:55:37** and hitting my sub-4 goal despite heat and humidity. The race had great scenery, a friendly crowd, and a brutal bridge climb at the end. If you’re debating whether to run your first marathon — do it. You’ll learn more about yourself in 26.2 miles than you expect.

**Background & Motivation**

I grew up playing soccer, then lacrosse in high school, and picked up rowing in college — which I still do as my main sport. I was acquainted with running but recently it had been just cross-training: occasional 5Ks, done inconsistently, and usually followed by soreness.

In fall 2023, I decided to take running more seriously. I bought a proper pair of shoes and joined a local run club as a social outlet and cross-training tool. The consistency helped — I got used to the motion, soreness faded, and I started enjoying it.

By November 2024, I ran a half marathon in 1:43:50 (\~7:55/mi) and realized I liked the structure of training. I had a goal to run a marathon in 2025 but wasn’t sure how to fit it in with rowing. A gap between seasons — mid-July through October — opened the door. It gave me roughly a 10-week block, short but manageable, and I decided to give it a go. I didn’t sign up right away; I wanted to see how my body responded first. When things held up, I registered about 2–3 weeks before race day.

**Training & Preparation**

I used my Coros watch’s marathon training plan as a framework. It initially projected a **4:02 finish** and capped the fastest target time at **3:51**. My stretch goal was 3:45.

The plan was decent, but I quickly realized it didn’t fully account for my rowing volume — 4–5 hours per week — which kept me aerobically fit but made strict adherence tricky. When I missed a run, Coros would automatically lower my “running fitness” score, even though my overall fitness (tracked in the app) was improving.

I adapted by:

* **Making long runs more linear:** Coros ramped up long runs too slowly early on and too aggressively near the end, so I smoothed the progression myself.
* **Balancing fatigue with rowing:** If I was drained from a hard row, I’d skip or shorten a run. That flexibility kept me injury-free.
* **Focusing on efficiency over volume:** I averaged 3 runs/week, usually 23–24 miles total, which were comprised of an easy run, a medium run with some speed intervals, and a weekend long run.

Long runs built up from 9 → 12 → 15 → 20 miles. I took a vacation during week 8 for hiking at elevation, which knocked my running fitness down a bit. My 20-miler right after that was a grind — hot, dehydrated, poor fueling — and I had to walk the final mile. But it got done, and that mental win mattered. I followed that up the very next week with a strong 14-mile tempo run at \~8:32 pace, which assured me that I am capable of more than what I experienced in the 20-miler.

Over the course of the training block, my average pace hovered in the **mid-9s**, mostly zone 2. I did most short runs without music, saving easy/funny audiobooks like *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy* for long runs — great mental distraction.

**Fueling & Nutrition**

Electrolytes: Mortal Hydration (Salty Mix) for daily runs, LMNT for long ones — both tasted good and sat well.  
Carbs: I trained my gut to handle 100 g/hour using homemade gels (a Maurten ""copycat” recipe). I’d take a swig every mile, and chase it with water or electrolytes.

Recovery: I used creatine at night to aid water retention and muscle repair, plus BPN's tart cherry and  amino acids recovery to smooth out to help with recovery. I'm going to continue using creatine but I'm not fully sold on the tart cherry hype.

In race week, I went all-in on carbs — **500–600 g/day** for the two days before, with variety: pasta, bread, crackers, bananas, dates, hummus, and plenty of fluids. My stomach handled it great.

Hydration: I ran with an 18oz water bottle that I refilled on the course and mixed more electrolytes into. Around mile 22, I started grabbing **ice at aid stations**, stuffing it in my hat — huge help in the rising heat.

**Race Day Experience**

To prep for the early start, I trained my wake-up time all week, setting alarms an hour earlier than usual. On race morning, I woke up 2 hours before gun time, had coffee, a white-bread-and-jam sandwich, a few dates, and a packet of caffeinated Skratch gummies 15 minutes before the gun.

It was warm and humid — mid-60s at the start, climbing into the 70s. My ambitious goal was 3:45, but with the forecast, I joined the 4:00 pace group to stay conservative. They went out fast (\~8:40/mi instead of 9:09), which combined with the humidity, heat, and adrenaline, spiked my heart rate early. I settled into rhythm by mile 3, right on the edge between zone 2 and zone 3, and kept that effort through mile 15–16.

The only hiccup I had on race day was that one of my two gel flasks fell out early in the race, cutting my carb supply in half (from \~400g to \~200g). Luckily, I supplemented with on-course gels and avoided bonking.

The course was diverse — neighborhoods, shaded parks, and eventually forested trails. Around mile 12–16, I hit my stride with some 8:30 splits. I skipped music early to soak in the crowd and scenery, saving my headphones for the last 10 miles when motivation tends to fade.

By mile 20, I felt strong — way better than during my 20-mile training run — thanks to better fueling and carb loading. But after mile 22, the heat took over. Temps rose to 72–73°F with full sun exposure. I grabbed ice at every stop, stuffed it under my hat, and took water whenever possible.

The Hoan Bridge loomed in the distance near the end — beautiful but daunting. The climb was tough but steady; the descent didn’t bring as much speed as I hoped, but by then, I was just focused on finishing.

Crossing the line at **3:55:37** felt surreal. I didn’t hit the 3:45 stretch goal, but I crushed the sub-4 and felt proud of how controlled and steady the race was. I found my girlfriend right after, took a few deep breaths, and let the moment sink in.

**Gear:** Nike Alphafly 3s + Bombas socks. Only a tiny blister on one toe — noticed it post-race, not during.

**Takeaways & Next Steps**

The experience was incredible — the crowd, the volunteers, and the shared sense of effort were genuinely inspiring.

I'm glad that I listened to advice and adjusted my plan and expectations to account for the sub-optimal conditions. Had I sent it at the start, my pace would have been much less steady

This year, I've run **278 miles total**, including the marathon, so I definitely walked the fine line between “prepared enough” and “risking injury.”

Next time, I’ll:

* Extend training to **14–16 weeks** with more mileage.
* Integrate **speed work and tempo runs**.
* Treat vacations and rest as part of the plan.
* Make running the *priority* sport for the training cycle.

I’m absolutely doing another marathon. There’s more speed in me — and now that I know what to expect, I’m excited to see what I can do with more focus.

If you’re training for your first marathon: **listen to your body, respect the distance, but don’t underestimate yourself**. You might surprise yourself with how much you can handle when you just keep moving forward.",3,1759898276.0,firstmarathon,0,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I've been obsessing over wool sweaters lately, and I thought I'd share my recent discoveries about the latest trends and styles. Trust me, this isn't your grandma's old scratchy sweater we're talking about!

I've noticed that this season's wool sweaters are all about combining comfort with modern aesthetics. The newest designs feature oversized silhouettes with subtle geometric patterns - think minimal Scandinavian vibes. What really caught my eye was this amazing merino wool sweater I found at https://athometouch.com/wool-sweater. The quality is incredible, and it's so soft you wouldn't believe it's wool.

The hottest trend right now is definitely the mock-neck style. It's like a turtleneck's cooler, more laid-back cousin. These sweaters look super polished for work but are cozy enough for weekend coffee runs. The ribbed detailing at the cuffs and hem is also huge this season - it gives that extra touch of structure while keeping things modern.

I've also noticed a lot of color blocking in new wool sweater designs. Instead of traditional solid colors, designers are playing with two or three-tone combinations. Navy with cream, charcoal with burnt orange - these combinations are fresh and super wearable.

Something that really impressed me about modern wool sweaters is the technology behind them. Many brands are now using treated wool that's machine washable (goodbye, dry cleaning bills!). Plus, they're incorporating temperature-regulating properties that make these sweaters perfect for layering.

For anyone looking to upgrade their winter wardrobe, I'd seriously recommend checking out https://athometouch.com/wool-sweater. They have this amazing selection of contemporary styles that perfectly balance tradition with modern design.

One trend I'm particularly excited about is the return of the cable knit, but with a twist. Instead of the traditional busy patterns, designers are opting for single statement cables or asymmetrical designs. It's like they took everything we loved about classic wool sweaters and gave them a modern makeover.

The sustainability angle is also worth mentioning. Many new wool sweaters are being made with responsibly sourced wool, and some brands are even using recycled wool in their collections. It's pretty cool to see fashion moving in a more eco-conscious direction.

Pro tip: When shopping for these new styles, pay attention to the wool blend. The best ones I've found combine merino wool with a touch of synthetic fiber for durability. This combination gives you the warmth of wool with better shape retention and easier care.

If you're thinking about getting one, now's actually a great time. Many retailers are launching their new collections, and there are some really innovative designs out there. Just make sure to check the care instructions - some of these modern pieces are surprisingly low-maintenance!

Chapter 1
At our class reunion, my husband lost a game of truth or dare and was dared to call the person he regretted most in his life.
I listened as a woman's voice came through the phone.
She asked, ""If I get divorced now, will you give me a place to call home?""
Marcus answered confidently, ""Yes.""
An awkward silence filled the room.
Everyone expected a dramatic response from me, but instead, I calmly took off my wedding ring and walked away.
He returned home late again that night.
I handed him the divorce papers I had prepared beforehand, ""Marcus, let's end this marriage.""
Upon hearing this, Marcus tugged impatiently at his tie, ""Frances, this is absurd. Over such a trivial thing, you’re making a scene and daring to bring up divorce? You've really grown bold!""
He had just pledged himself to another woman, in front of everyone, yet accused me of overreacting.
No surprise there. My endless tolerance over the years had led him to see me as a pushover—someone he could manipulate at will, not even worthy of expressing anger.
I chuckled at myself, ""I'm willingly stepping aside for her; shouldn’t that make you happy?""
Marcus's brow furrowed; I noticed the displeasure in his eyes.
""Stop being irrational, will you? It was just a game. Livia is a friend; do you expect me to reject her outright and embarrass her? Frances, you shouldn’t be so selfish.""
I nodded, ""Yes, you’re right, which is why we should separate.""
This was my second time mentioning divorce, and Marcus, usually composed, showed a flicker of panic. But he quickly regained his calm.
""Frances, don’t use divorce to threaten me.""
""Apologize to Livia properly, and I might reconsider. Otherwise, I don’t mind changing the role of Mrs. Kelley.""
It was utterly laughable.
Three years of marriage, and Marcus's heart had always belonged to Livia.
I was foolish not to see it clearly until today.
I said nothing more, simply tearing up the only photo we had together.
It was taken at our wedding, only after I had begged Marcus persistently; he reluctantly agreed.
In the photo, he showed no hint of joy, starkly contrasting my own expression.
I had cherished this photo once, but now, under Marcus's shocked gaze, I slowly tore it to pieces.
""Marcus, we're getting divorced.""
After a brief moment of disbelief, Marcus spoke coldly, ""Frances, don’t regret this!""
He stormed out, leaving behind a floor covered in torn fragments.
This was how he always treated me.
Any time I did something that displeased him, he'd punish me until I begged for forgiveness, then he’d generously pardon me.
He forgot that today was our third wedding anniversary.
I had originally prepared a big surprise for him.
But I didn't expect that he would call Livia at the party, and when she asked that question, he agreed without hesitation.
My last illusion about him was completely shattered.
Three years of marriage, and I finally realized I couldn’t win his heart.
So I decided to let him go and free myself.
---
The next morning, I was about to book a ride on my phone when I saw Livia's post on Facebook.
""No matter when, if I look back, you'll always be waiting there for me.""
The accompanying photo showed fingers intertwined, with Marcus wearing the watch I had custom-made for him on his birthday. It had our initials engraved on it.
When Marcus put on the watch, he said he was willing to leave the past behind and try with me.
Hearing those words made me ecstatic, foolishly believing that three years of devotion hadn’t been in vain, and he finally noticed me.
That night was also when we consummated our marriage for the first time.
My hand instinctively went to my belly.
Yes, I was pregnant.
Last night, I intended to share the good news, but now, it was unnecessary.
I blocked Livia.
I went alone to the hospital to schedule an abortion. As the cold instruments entered my body, I cried with pain.
How liberating!
From now on, the last tie to Marcus was completely severed.
During my hospital stay, Marcus never called.
Due to the damage to my body, the doctor said it might be difficult for me to have children in the future.
Saying I wasn't saddened would be a lie, but more than anything, I felt relief.
At least my child wouldn't be like me, pathetically yearning for Marcus's occasional scraps of affection.
""My dear, you finally woke up. That jerk Marcus doesn't deserve you.""
""Don't worry, once you're divorced, I'll hire a team of male models just for you. Why stick with one bad man when you can have a whole entourage?""
My only close friend, Isabelle, wholeheartedly supported my decision to divorce.
Seeing her exaggerated expression, I couldn't help but laugh.
She looked at me with utmost seriousness and said, ""Frannie, this time, make sure you don't go back to him.""
I nodded, ""I won't.""
After the divorce, I'll leave this city behind once and for all.

Chapter 2
I spent two weeks in the hospital, and Marcus didn't call me once. When I was finally discharged, I returned home. As soon as I stepped inside, I saw Livia lounging in one of Marcus's white button-down shirts, her bare legs on full display.
She tilted her head provocatively, revealing a suspicious red mark on her neck. ""Marcus can be so intense; I told him to take it easy,"" she mused.
I wasn't bothered by the mark; it was the emerald necklace around her neck that caught my attention. ""Who gave you that necklace?"" I asked.
Livia smirked. ""Oh, this? I mentioned I liked it, and Marcus gave it to me,"" she replied casually.
I reached out to take it back. ""Give it to me.""
That necklace was the only keepsake my mother left me, and Marcus knew it perfectly well, yet he still gave it to Livia.
""No way, Marcus gave it to me, so it's mine now,"" Livia retorted with a smug smile. ""Oh, I remember, this was your dear mother's auction prize, right? Stylish choice, but it's mine now.""
""You and your late mother are destined to lose to me!"" she taunted.
Rage boiled inside me, and I lunged forward to reclaim my mother's heirloom. Livia swiftly changed her tune. ""Sis, I've already explained—I spilled coffee on my clothes and had to wear Marcus's. Why are you acting like this?""
""Cut the nonsense and give me back the necklace!"" I snapped.
Just as my hand neared the necklace, Marcus rushed out and shoved me aside. Unable to dodge, my waist slammed into the edge of a table.
The sharp pain nearly buckled my legs, and I clung to the table corner to stay upright. Sweat beaded on my forehead from the agony, and my face turned pale.
Marcus sneered, ""Frances, stop playing the victim. You come home just to harass Livia!""
""Really, pulling that schoolyard bullying act again? Let me tell you, as long as I'm here, you won't lay a finger on Livia!""
""Schoolyard bullying?"" I echoed, looking at Livia. ""Is that what you told him?""
A flicker of panic crossed Livia's eyes, but she quickly shifted her demeanor, feigning fear as she clung to Marcus's sleeve. ""No, Frances didn't bully me; I was just rambling...""
She shed a few tears, instantly dispelling all of Marcus's doubts.
He shielded Livia with his body, saying, ""Livia, don't be afraid. I'm here, and nobody can hurt you!""
Marcus glared at me with disdain, ""Even Frances can't.""
Even though I was set on divorce, his loathing gaze felt like a dagger through my heart. I remembered years ago when Marcus held my hand and earnestly promised, ""I'll always protect you.""
And indeed he had. He was gentle and caring, carrying me to the hospital when I was ill. His kindness made my heart flutter irresistibly.
But everything changed when Livia appeared.
Livia was my father's illegitimate daughter. She always played the victim, winning Marcus's sympathy. He accused me of being heartless, claiming I vented my grievances from past generations on innocent Livia.
What he didn't know was that his so-called innocent Livia led the bullying against me in college. She locked me in the bathroom, forcing me to drink toilet water. She pressed a heated curling iron against my back, scorching my skin until I nearly passed out. Only when they realized things had gone too far did they call an ambulance to take me to the hospital.
The first thing I was made to do upon waking was to sign a letter of forgiveness, coerced by my father.
He said, ""Livia was just confused; as her elder sister, you shouldn't hold it against her.""
It wasn't as if he hadn't seen the bloody and raw state of my back. But his heart had already tipped entirely in Livia's favor.
I thought at least Marcus would understand me. So I sought him out myself, only to be met with his cold and ruthless gaze.
""Frances, I never expected you to be so cruel!""
But what had I done? It was me who was the victim, yet everyone sided with the perpetrator.
From that moment on, everything shifted. At home or outside, I became the least welcome presence. I was like a villain in a soap opera, always cast aside.
Taking a deep breath, I reached out my hand toward them. ""Give me back the necklace; it's my mother's heirloom.""
Marcus's eyes momentarily showed a hint of guilt. He knew. My father despised my mother and burned all her belongings in a fit of rage after she was gone. That necklace was the sole heirloom she left me.
He seemed to hesitate. ""Livia, just return it to her. I'll get you something prettier later.""
""But I really like it,"" Livia pouted, giving me a nasty look despite her docile façade as she reluctantly removed the necklace.
Just as my hand was about to touch the necklace, she suddenly let it drop. It hit the ground and shattered into pieces!
Without hesitation, I slapped Livia across the face.
The next moment, Marcus shoved me down with force. ""Frances, haven't you had enough? You dare bully Livia right in front of me—how come I didn't see this side of you before!""
I fell onto the shards of emerald, blood staining my hands. Marcus's eyes flickered with a pang of guilt, but ultimately, he clenched his fist. ""Frances, you brought this upon yourself for bullying Livia.""
How laughable. My husband held another woman in his arms, blaming me, his rightful wife, for being heartless.
""Yeah, this villain should have stepped down long ago. So, did you sign the divorce papers yet?""
Since he'd already brought his mistress under our roof, I assumed he had signed the divorce documents. But for some reason, Marcus seemed furious at the mention of it.
""Frances, do you really want to divorce me that badly?""
Livia feigned sorrow, chiming in, ""Sis, please don't fight with Marcus because of me. I should be the one to leave.""
She said that, yet clung to Marcus, pressing herself as close as possible. Her intentions were clear to anyone but Marcus.
""Livia, you don't have to lower yourself to her level. I'm here; she can't bully you,"" Marcus assured her, throwing me a disdainful look as he added, ""Frances, don't think I don't know what you're up to. Threatening me with divorce, huh? I hate being threatened more than anything!""
I chuckled coldly. ""Marcus, you're overestimating yourself.""
""A man compromised like you is of no use to me anymore.""
""You like her, right? Then she's all yours.""
""You...""
Livia's eyes lit up at the mention of divorce from Marcus. She wrapped herself around his arm, pretending to plead, ""Sis, you're really misunderstanding. Marcus and I aren't like that; I just returned to the country and know no one else...""
""Oh, so your father has already passed, and you have nowhere else to go, huh?""
Marcus probably didn't expect me to be so blunt. He angrily scolded, ""Frances, look at yourself—do you have any resemblance to the woman you once were?""
""In your eyes, only Livia deserves to be Mrs. Kelley. So let's get divorced.""
""Can you stop bringing up divorce every other sentence?""
""Isn't that exactly what you want? My future brother-in-law.""
I deliberately emphasized the words ""brother-in-law,"" and Marcus predictably flew into a rage. He pulled out the divorce papers from the table, signed them right in front of me, and tossed them over.
""Are you satisfied now? Let me tell you, even if you beg me, I'll never forgive you!""
I carefully checked the signature on the papers, feeling relieved. ""Rest assured, I won't.""
As I reached the door, I seemed to remember something. ""Oh, by the way, tomorrow we'll finalize the divorce certificate. Don't be late.""
All I received was Marcus's cold command to ""get out!""
Livia watched with a face full of smug anticipation.
But she didn't know—everything here, including Marcus, was already meaningless to me.",1,1759897680.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False
1o10za4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1o10za4/how_to_be_happily_ever_after_with_avoidants/,How to be happily ever after with avoidants!,"So, I just learned through an online assessment that I am disorganized.  No wonder that’s my attachment type, it was developed as a means to survive!  I’m not going to bore you with how I got here, but let’s just say that I am a very smart female 57 years old, Hispanic and used to being discriminated and abused (sexually, emotionally and physically since I was 5 years old, maybe earlier, but that’s as far as I can remember).  Well, so here I go.  I end up with a few avoidant men.  And I am finally seeing the similarities.  Wow!  This last relationship that ghosted me, I know this!  Aha!  So I’m dealing with the same type of man.  Like the one I gave my virginity to(well if can say that because I was messed around with when I was 6-8 years old).  The same type of man I was pregnant by later at 29, and it turned out he had a wife in another state. But wait!  Were these 2 guys avoidant?  Well, love bombing at the beginning, slow burn out phase, breadcrumbing, discard, and then back several times until I told them to Fckoff.  🤔 Yeah, avoidant!
Well, I’ll tell you , both of those guys were back and I manipulated the heck out of them.  The one that took my “virginity” been married twice and will come back to me and cheat on whomever he is with at my beck and call.  And the one who was married ended up divorced through my doing and has had a couple of wives since then because he is my daughter’s father and I refused to engage with him further.
But then, when my daughter was 7 and I was 37, I refused to engage further with these 2 clowns and I started dating another avoidant, of course.  This one I was married to for 13 years and had sex with only 5 times in those 13 years. Why? Well another avoidant!   Fear of intimacy.  We ended up getting divorced and I’m free to date again.  Guess who I find?  Another avoidant, who is single, never been married, no children and 59.  I’m 57 now.  So for 6 weeks he ghosted me after an 8 month relationship, and I sent the right text 2 weeks after ghosting and waited and now what?  This last one is back after 6 weeks no contact trying to connect but so is the ex husband who is back in town and moved nearby for good because he wants to rekindle our marriage.  😂 But also my daughter’s father got divorced and we have been having coffee dates here and there, although I’m less inclined towards him because there is my daughter who is now about to get married herself. And oh, well, the one that took my virginity in early 20’s is also lurking.  And I’m wondering, am I just a magnet for avoidants or do I just know how to manipulate all of them?
So what did I do to all these men?  I let them leave when they wanted to, never chased and moved on to someone else, engaged them in conversation and light bantering when they came back, but gave them a diminished role in my life because I had moved on. I was calling the shots when they came back.  And I will continue doing what I am doing.  So far, I have a pick between 4 avoidant men that I loved between 24 and 57 years old.  Can’t get better than this! I have who I want when I want now. And they’ll never get too fearful and scared off because they feel that I am a fleeting love.  Always moving, always on my way out between the 4 of them.  I’m on a dating app to find the 5th.  I think I finally got over the last one when I realized recently that they were all avoidants!

I loved his work and chatted with him about it from time to time, sometimes he opened about his personal life too. Eventually, some of the conversations became flirty and sexual. I was single and so was he. We flirt for a bit and I suggest we have fun in person but we lived in different cities so for it to happen was slim. We still talked about his work and what he had planned. He said he'll make me protection charms because he cared about me. I started to feel like he's getting attached and it's only been a few weeks of talking about surface level topics.

Eventually I become too busy to chat with him daily because I landed a new job. I would still respond to him whenever I could but he started to update me every other hour, every day about his life. It would be like:

""Its raining again"" 7 hours ago
""I need to go to the market"" 7 hours ago
""Time for coffee"" 4 hours ago
""I'm so tired"" 1 hour ago
""I'm hungry"" 10 mins ago

And I'd be at work or asleep when he messages me. I didn't know how to respond to the constant, monotonous updates most of the time. I felt guilty sometimes because I could not keep up with his chats. I tried to distance myself slowly but I got fed up because he'd often send stickers of lonely or waiting characters by the phone. 

After seeking advice from my friends, I told him we're friends but I don't need to hear his daily updates of his life and I apologized for even suggesting we meet up for sex. He apologized and never messaged me again.

A few months pass and I was curious about his work that he spoke about before and wanted to ask when he'd post about it again. He never responded anymore.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

Ladies, encouragement to pursue health and fitness. Slow but soooo rewarding.

B belly to ab definitions. 1.5 years of consistency. 5’0 feet and 57 kgs. 36F.

Still need to recomp as I still have fat around my arms and upper back (nowhere else. So bizarre). Last 5 kgs of fat to go. 💪

Since so many of you are asking:

Diet: 1400-1600 kcals, depending on my workout intensity 

- Protein - 100 g (mainly from plants and fish)
- Fibre - 30 g. Chia seeds, fermented foods, veggies, nuts, resistant starch (when you consume refrigerated simple carbs like bread or rice)
- Essential fats - as needed
- Carbs - I eat rice daily but restrict it to less than 150 gms. Other carbs are mostly from plants, legumes, nuts, etc, which also contain essential fats and fibre. So, win—win. 
- 3 litres of water. Plenty of veggies, legumes and nuts. 
- I take care of my gut. So, I consume a lot of different types of veggies and nuts for variety of soluble and insoluble fibre. 
- No restrictions. I’m a pescatarian. I eat desserts, sugar, biryani in moderation (meaning once or twice a week). So, I’m not punishing myself. 
- Also important to note is I naturally have excellent food moderation habits by genes and habit. I don’t have food noise. If you have food noise or addiction to food, please be gentle with yourself and get a hormonal check. You can do this. 
- important: I don’t eat after 6.30 pm. My first food/drink (coffee) is generally at 7.30 am the next day. First meal at 9.30 am or so. So, I do have a lot of gut rest and natural overnight fasting. But, if I feel low on energy or hungry, I eat some protein or fibre. This allows your gut to rest and reset. 

Routine:

- I put on muscle slowly. So, I workout accordingly. 3x a week moderate intensity strength training. I don’t go full intensity unless I feel like it. For my goals and body, moderate intensity is fine. Load bearing exercises destined for bone density maintenance and increase. Push, pull, core - split across 3 days. 1-1.5 hours. I like core and leg days. 
- 5x a day walking. 8K steps. Again moderation. If I feel like walking more, I do. 
- I move around a lot. I work mainly from home but I make sure to take a break every once in a while to move around for 5 mins and then get back to work. I have long work hours. So, this is important. 
- I make sure to get adequate sleep. It’s a struggle because I’m prone to high stress and I’m a c-suite corporate woman. CxO. So, I have to do this intentionally. I journal and talk to friends to wind down before bed. Read something. And then sleep. Mental health is very important. Protect it at all costs. 

There you go. It’s a lot. But, it’s necessary. ",134,1759897205.0,TwoXIndia,46,0.97,False

I don’t want to be with you/I don’t even have a relationship with you. Yet every now and then I feel like a small child with a strange familiarity of what it was like then.
