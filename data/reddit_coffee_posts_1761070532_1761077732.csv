So I’m going to focus on my side of the situation with only minimal context to respect their anonymity while also giving some relevant context. NA is a safe space and I refuse to be the one to make it less safe and anonymous for anyone else. 

I’ve been going every week for almost 1 month now and I’ve started to feel more comfortable and even reached out to someone there. But earlier this week I felt like I was about to have a panic attack. I started feeling like I needed to get out of there so I quietly walked to the quiet room to calm down. I decided to just hang out in there until after the meeting. I wasn’t triggered by the other’s sharing their own stories but I’ve had a lot going on and it’s piling up on me fast and hard. Honestly, I don’t think most people could carry it all on their own but I live alone with a tiny circle so I have no other choice. After the meeting ended I slipped away speed walking out of the building. I realized maybe I should have said something to someone. Even just a brief explanation since we’re all in this together but I ultimately decided to just keep walking and sit down outside the coffee shop next door, trying not to  cry.  When I reached out later she didn’t judge me or even point it out so maybe I was justified for walking out? I mean, those rooms are for people to calm down in and/or settle their children or service animals as needed. But I walked out mid-speech while someone else was sharing their story and I feel awful about that. Looking back I feel like I was being insensitive and should’ve tried to wait until they finished. But in the moment I just needed to get out and calm down. I can’t decide if I should’ve handle it differently or if my reaction was justified. I stayed in the building for the rest of the meeting, I just wasn’t present for the last 15 minutes.

I learned so much from you, especially when things ended. I learned of that hidden cruelty and detachment. Such a slow and drawn out break up, made worse by both of us. Enough that you never felt the need to explain yourself. You built a life away from us, to escape to when the time was right for you. As you did that, I faded. You’d already taken from me every sense of self. I lived for you and was subservient to you and your goals, dreams and desires. My own had evaporated.

It was easy to move forward once you let me go. A new job, new friends and new connections. I had a fling, it fizzled quickly. 18 months and the best I could do was a rebound, still trying to be loyal to you. But you’d moved on, of course. We were zero contact but it was easy to see when you were in another relationship. I stayed alone and healed. And then love found me again. Unexpectedly and out of nowhere. A chance conversation, a coffee out in the cold. Real connection, knowing now that I wasn’t broken. 

But you came back. My happiness was nothing to do with you and still, you tried to destroy it. I remained zero contact. Continued to build my life. 

The things left unsaid can stay that way. You showed me after you left me that you have a capacity for malice and cruelty. 

That’s why I’ve built a life and a family. Something untouchable, built on pure love and teamwork. And it’s something I truly doubt you will ever have. For that, I pity you. I need no explanations. No justifications. No more will I feel the need for any kind of validation from you. I loved you, you hurt me. That’s all I need to know.",5,1761076894.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

1ocn9u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1ocn9u3/rot_dystopiashort_storyfinished/,Rot [Dystopia][Short Story][Finished],"“Hear-ye hear-ye! Today marks the 5th anniversary of the horrid disaster,” cried out a young feline boy, waving a newspaper over his head.

 “Today is the 5th anniversary since Neaville’s Spore-Core disaster. Mister, mister, buy a paper, stay up to date with the current situation and the power-struggle.”

The kid called out to a bunny who was passing by. The bunny stopped, turning sleepily toward the city crier who was desperate to sell papers.

“Ugh, fine. What else is new?”

The kid shrugged, “Only know the headlines, mister. 2 spoins please.”

The bunny reached into his overly complicated coin purse, a mechanical device that opened up automatically upon sensing the heat-proximity of his paws.

It hissed as it opened.

He reached in to take out 2 shiny coins with a 1 spore stamped on each of them.

“Now stop shouting, I’m too sleepy for that,” the bunny grumbled as he grabbed the paper. As soon as he turned around to walk away, the kid shouted again, his high-pitched, undeveloped voice, like nails on a chalkboard, sent a shiver down the bunny’s spine.

A few minutes later, armed with a coffee in 1 of his mechanical arms that protruded from the depths of his backpack, the long-eared mechanic folded the newspaper over, reading a few of the headlines.

He yawned, flipping the page over,

“Alas, I’m too tall to join their union, they do have a nice benefits package,” the bunny grumbled to himself, taking a long sip of the steaming--black as the spore-engine’s oil--fluid, that was known as.

The walk to the city center was an exciting one, barely giving room for thinking as at any time a core-powered chariot might try to run you over. Steaming, whistling, tracked wagons rushed past, delivering overworked workers to factories for their 12-hour shifts.

The bunny wished for some morning sun, the warmth of the morning rays, the dew on the leaves, but instead, there was only smog, stench, and the whistle of steam as it escaped the engines, and the groans of machinery. This was no paradise, but it was the only life they now knew.

\#

“Lester?” the guard called out, glaring sharply at the newspaper-distracted bunny whose ears twitched lazily at the sound of his name. He lowered the paper and took another sip of coffee from his mechanical helper-arm.

“Who let the dogs out?”

Lester grinned.

“Hah! Such humor. You know the rules, buddy.”

The guard was a rottweiler standing tall on two strong legs; his arms were each the size of the bunny’s torso.

“Yes yes,” he pulled out his badge and presented it, then took off his tools backpack for examination by the security before being allowed inside.

His gaze lazily wandered around until it fixated on a brand new, sparkling, and shining placard.

  
 Spore-CoreProperty of the

No trespassing--violators will be.

A few moments later, he was inside the reactor’s building, navigating the winding hallways that kept splitting off. He followed the blue line--. On the lower floors, he could hardly find any living creatures; an occasional overworked engineer would rush past him while he was rummaging through messes and coils of wires during his inspection.

“The engineering section’s lighting occasionally shorts,” he reminded himself of his task.

 “Random flickering for a few minutes, then stops.”

He paused his work for a deep, long yawn that echoed through the empty halls.

As he reopened his eyes, there was darkness all around. His mechanical arm spread its fingers out, one of them opened up, and from within it a lighter came out.

 it lit up at last--a dim, flickering light that barely illuminated the bundle of wires in the bunny’s hands.

“Hmmmm, nope, wasn’t me,” he concluded, glancing around.

The lights flickered on, then off again, in irregular intervals. It wasn’t like a spontaneous short; it seemed wrong and intentional, as if someone was playing with a light switch, of the entire section. He watched it; his instincts flared up.

\#

There was clomping of hooves. Someone was approaching. His ears twitched, listening cautiously.

 “Again the flickering, so annoying,” groaned a distant creature with a deep, harsh voice.

“Annoying? It’s ominous. Something is wrong. Yesterday’s crew said the reactor went down to 20% output a few times; they couldn’t ID the cause,” somebody whose steps were soft and elegant, replied to the hooved creature.

“Odd,” the deep-voiced creature replied.

 “Anything else?”

“Hmmm, there’s also the--” he paused, peering through the flickering lights at the long-eared shape up ahead, “Talk later.”

\#

Lester’s ears twitched again as he returned his attention to the wiring mess in his hands. The two approached him shortly after.

“Lester!? Didn’t know you were on shift today,” called out the soft-voiced fox.

 “Got called in because of, well, this--” the bunny replied with a hint of irritation in his voice. The lights flickered a few more times, then stopped.

 “Well done, you’ve fixed it,” the ox joked, walking past the B-class mechanic. Lester scuffed in their direction, murmuring under his breath, “Tsk, good for nothing assholes.”

Lester’s inspection lasted a while longer before he found himself even lower, on the floor of the reactor, rummaging through a power panel. His hand brushed up against something unexpectedly soft. He leaned closer, trying to catch a glimpse of what it might be, but the angle wasn’t good; he couldn’t see.

His mechanical arm’s middle finger opened up, a compass emerged from it, pointing in the direction of the nearest loose screw, “Nope, wrong, uhm, ring,” he called out.

The ring finger split open, and from within it emerged a hex-screwdriver.

 “I need Phillips,” he groaned, reaching into his tools pouch.

In that moment, the lights flickered off, not turning back on for a while.

 “Erhmmm,” he paused, looking around suspiciously.

 “Not good,” he gulped.

A few seconds passed before emergency lighting kicked in and sirens blared.

“Emergency Lockdown initiated. 5 minutes until lockdown, evacuate immediately,” the automated system broadcast on the intercom.

Lester did not hesitate; he sprang instantly into action, hopping swiftly in the direction of the nearest exit, leaving behind half of his tools and the opened service panel.

As he dashed on all fours, he remembered reading about the Neaville’s Spore-Core meltdown and the fallout that ensued after; he really did not want to be anywhere near the reactor if it were to melt down. he recalled reading.

Sirens continued to blare in a deafening loudness. The whole building seemingly buzzed with uncontrollable power as the reactor underwent emergency shutdown. Service panels sparkled, fuses blew violently, and some of the emergency lights were exploding from overload.

 “Three minutes until lockdown, all engineering staff-evacuate immediately.”

“B-4 is now under lockdown,” the intercom announced. Lester watched the walls slowly lower as he dashed under them. Hurried hooves behind him, slammed right into the wall, “LESTER! MANUAL OVERRIDE!” a panicked voice called out, “PLEASE!”

Lester glanced quickly at the manual controls panel.

“B-3 lockdown initiating in one minute.”

He knew he had no time. It’d take no less than half a minute to open and then re-seal the lockdown barrier, he had no time, he still had three floors to cover.

 “I’m sorry,” he mumbled, turning and sprinting away.

\#

The alarm blared, scattering his thoughts. Lester jolts awake, panic filling every fiber of his little body.

 “Gah--hah? Already?”

He sighed, slamming his paw on the alarm to shut it off.

 “What a day that was.”

He hopped off the bed and dragged himself to the curtains to pry them open. The street was alive and as noisy as ever.

The tracked wagons were up and running yet again, the crisis was averted, and the city was back to its former self: smog, noise, and endless rush to make money for the Grimswell.

Streets were busy, bustling with the life of a morning rush. The same as always.

“Hear-ye hear-ye. The Grimswell begins construction of a second Spore-Core to accommodate the growing city--hiring new staff. A generous pay and benefits package. Apply today,” the same high-pitched kid shouted. Lester sighed as he approached.

“Let me see that,” he ripped the paper out of the kid’s hands and flipped it open. Not a single mention of a near-meltdown the day prior.

“Corrupt bastards,” Lester rubbed his temples.

A thought crept up on his mind,

Conflicted, he stumbled off in the direction of the Spore-Core to resume his next work shift.

\#

The walk to work was much the same. Rushing chariots, whistling machines, the metallic screech of steel wheels on steel tracks as the spore-engines came to a halt, dropping off workers.

Security, search, and not a mention of the incident last night.

“Erhm, Gorg, what happened yesterday?” he asked after walking past the metal detector, while the guards searched his bag.

“Hmm? What happened yesterday?”

“The uhm, lockdown protocol?”

Lester hesitated.

“Oh, that? Yes yes, the higher-ups said it was an unplanned training. Hah, what jokesters eh? Scared the spores out of a few of our engineers, I’ve heard a few folks got locked in the lower levels, thinking they were done for.”

Lester shuddered,

Smiling anxiously at the guard, Lester nodded.

 “Yeah, hope no more of those.”

And so began his work day on the lower levels again.

Albeit anxious, he performed his duties diligently, tracking down the electrical issues to the same panel where he was working yesterday. While unscrewing the panel to get inside, he heard stampeding hooves rushing in his direction. he thought to himself, turning around just in time to get grabbed by his jumpsuit and lifted off the ground.

“LESTER!”

“Oh, I guess the lockdown truly WAS a training, wasn’t it? Either that or I’m seeing my favorite ghost, Twohorn. How delightful to see you alive and well.”

The ox heaved, his nostrils flared angrily.

 “You left me behind, I should make a stew out of you.”

The bunny shuddered, “Correction, I sprinted ahead of you. You just happened to be too slow. I didn’t engineer these systems.”

“You could’ve,” the ox began, but the bunny interrupted him.

“Yes, and then we’d be both locked in on the B3 instead of B4, that really wouldn’t have gotten either of us saved. Besides, it’s not exactly in my job description to rescue oxes in distress, not even damsels.”

The ox raised his other hand, ready to plant it firmly on the bunny’s face, when a bull and a husky guards approached them.

“That’ll be quite enough. Return to your duties, Class A engineer, Class B mechanic. You are not paid to fight, you’re paid to work. Mr Grimswell does not approve of wasted work time.”

\#

The metallic panel cover clattered to the floor--Lester dropped it in shock.

The soft thing his hand had brushed against yesterday was visible now, and it was certainly not mechanical in nature.

*A mushroom.*

Growing straight out of the power conduit--a high-voltage cable, armored in steel sheathing, carrying through the Spore-Core’s main arteries. Yet there it was, poking through the cracked casing, alive where no life should ever be.

“Holy,” Lester gasped, glancing around.

 “Well, there’s your short-circuiting issue.”

He gulped.

As he reached for it, the power flickered again. He hesitated, then poked it again.

The powers went out.

When he pulled his hand away, the power flickered back on. he thought to himself, rummaging through his tool bag for a pair of bolt-cutters.

“Here goes nothing,” he commented, poking it again to cause a power outage so that the surveillance system malfunctions too.

While the power was off, he swiftly snipped the mushroom with the bolt-cutters and threw it in his toolbag before the lights came back on.

The power was restored, and while he fiddled with other wires, pretending to troubleshoot so as not to be noticed, the lunch time soon approached.

He made his way out of the building swiftly, setting course to his friend’s lab, a little underground augmentation and research laboratory run by the.

Tinkerbit, the Rataunion top-tier engineer and Lester’s close friend, didn’t even need a second look. He was well accustomed to the Bloom-Shrooms and instantly recognized them.

 “Yap, that’s a bloom alright.”

“What? How?”

Tinkerbit shrugged, “Your guess is as good as mine. Perhaps the fungi are resisting the corrupt government too? Who knows, maybe they’re tired of being milked for their power? I mean, everything runs on these damned things: your watch? The blender? All of it. I’d be sabotaging the reactor too if I were them.”

Lester tapped his paw impatiently on the floor, “This is so far above my pay-grade, but we’ve ought to do something.”

Tinkerbit in the meantime was preparing some sort of a chamber, “I’ll keep it yes-yes?”

“Sure,” Lester responded without so much as a second thought.

 “What now?”

Tinkerbit shrugged indifferently while shoving the mushroom inside a thick, metallic canister and then plugging it into some sort of test setup.

“Shut it down yourself? Tell the press? Get the mayor? Leave the city?”

Lester slammed his curled-up fist into the palm of his other hand, “That’s it! I’ll tell the mayor, he’ll shut down the corrupt Grimswell’s Operations, and the city will be safe.”

“Hah, best of luck with that,” Tinkerbit commented, heeding the bunny no attention as his focus was on the now buzzing canister with the Bloom-Shroom that was violently releasing seemingly endless amounts of spores inside the chamber, producing power.

Lester’s gaze momentarily glued to the display that showed *‘2 MHw.’*

A few short moments later--Lester left in haste, his course set on the Mayor’s office.

\#

Lester hustled down the market street, paws tucked into his coat, a cup of coffee in his mechanical arm that he was sipping on impatiently.

He paused at a corner of a junk stall to quickly sell his used cup to the merchant, when his gaze fixated on a pale white-capped tiny mushroom, proudly poking through the seam between two street blocks. Tiny, barely perceivable, and utterly out of place.

He stared at it for a long moment.

Blinking in disbelief and rubbing his eyes, Lester sniffed the air. A faint stench of copper and mildew filled his nostrils when a voice pulled his attention from it.

 “Buying? Selling? Trading? We’ve got offers for all your junk.”

Lester glanced at the merchant; it was, unsurprisingly, a raccoon.

“Uhm, neither,” Lester hurried off, past the merchant.

A few blocks later, he saw a major commotion off in the distance. Police blocked off an entire block. tape fluttered in the wind.

He overheard a local reporter interviewing one of the officers, “A murder? In broad daylight? Unspeakable. Can you share any details?”

The officer hesitated before responding.

 “Uhm, well, no details yet, all we know is that the victim died due to numerous puncture wounds, as if repeatedly stabbed by a large needle-like object. That’s all we can share for now.”

Lester shuddered at the mere thought, the slight possibility of the corrupt Bloom-Spores spreading, and that the meltdown was not a drill yesterday.

He hastened his steps.

\#

“Purpose?” the mayor’s clerk asked in a bored and official tone.

“Emergency, I need to see the mayor immediately,” Lester held up his Class-B Mechanic badge as if it were an official federal agent’s badge that’d grant him access anywhere at any time.

“Everybody says that, the last one was a sloth who complained that the rabbits as neighbors were a risk to the slow-moving communities of this city.”

Lester sighed, “Look, it’s really, really important.”

The clerk slowly traced the appointments list, “Lucky you, must have a bunny’s paw. Mayor is free for the next 15 minutes, I’ll inform him of your visitation. Up the stairs, second floor, big door at the end of the hall,” the clerk informed him.

Lester sprinted off before she even finished her sentence, his ear twisted to pick up the rest of the directions while he hurried up the stairs.

The doors creaked without urgency, and the bunny rushed through them. His breath was ragged, and his fur-a total mess.

 “Mister mayor,” he called out.

The Mayor-a red panda, wearing a clean, black suit--stacked some papers and folded his hands, glancing up at the out-of-breath bunny who just stormed through his doors like an action-movie star.

“I have a,” Lester began, but then paused when he heard an impatient cough from someone to his left.

He looked there to see a sheep in a gray-patterned suit, grinning knowingly.

 “Mister Grimswell? Ahem w-what are you doing here?”

He swallowed nervously.

Grimswell, the CEO of the Grimswell Worker’s Union Guild, owner of the Spore-Core that powers the city, and the founder behind the very technology that powers everything.

“Oh, me? Don’t mind me, please, do go on about your business, Class-B mechanic, Lestern Nortur.”

Lester clenched his fist and tightened his jaw before returning his attention to the Mayor.

“Sir, the uhm, the Spore-Core is unstable. I, as Mister Grimswell just pointed out, work there and, well, I was there yesterday during the threat of a meltdown,” he continued, but the sheep interrupted him, “During the drill, you mean.”

Lester protested, but his warnings were ignored, disregarded, and overturned against him.

 “Besides, lunch break is long over, is it not? I would hate to see a Class B mechanic’s promising career ruined by, dare I say, incompetence and laziness.”

Lester sighed--it was pointless. The Mayor was bought by the Grimswell, and would do anything the CEO tells him.

The Grimswell grinned, as if a wolf in sheep’s clothes.

 “I assure you, the reactor is perfectly safe. Now, return to your duties at once, or we might be forced to conduct a performance evaluation.”

Lester nodded..

 “Yes, sir.”

\#

Bewildered, but not entirely surprised by his discovery, Lester swiftly returned to Tinkerbit who welcomed him with a grin.

 “Back so soon, was it a success?”

 “No,” Lester replied impatiently.

 “Figures, good thing the Rataunion never acts without plan B, so we’ll skip that one too,” Tinkerbit jumped over from 1 of his workbenches to another one, and tapped his tiny paws on a device the size of a bottle of water.

 “Take it,” Tinkerbit said.

Lester picked up the device and examined it. Inside the glass tube were copper coils that whined and hummed softly, charged and ready for whatever they were created for.

 “What’s this?” he queried, turning it in his paws.

“A scrambler. It won’t kill the core, but it’ll fry every single circuit in the facility, overload everything, shut it down, and likely render it irreparable. Backup systems will shut the reactor down safely and lock it all down. City goes dark but doesn’t turn into Neaville # 2. Catch my drift?”

Lester nodded, “So, I sneak this in past the security, activate it, Spore-Core goes down?”

Tinkerbit chuckled, “No no, no need for special agent stuff, my brethren of the Rataunion will take you in through the sewers and tunnels, we’ll take it out from underneath.”

\#

Days passed. Silence befell the city as the Spore-Core went out of commission, plunging the city into darkness and stillness.

What remaining machines existed ran out of juice within a day.

Factories no longer ran, spore-batteries were not produced.

While the city stood still, the news spread fast, albeit only in oral format.

BREAKING NEWS! At midnight two days ago, the Spore-Core powered down, cause:  *unknown*“. The Grimswell Worker’s Union Guild has yet to make an official statement. The mayor has been missing since then.”

Lester sat on a bench, sipping his coffee while admiring the stillness and silence, grinning ever so faintly. Only he, and a handful of rats knew what had happened. Tinkerbit’s words echoed in his mind.

I’m not sure if it’s an algorithmic gesture of care or a gentle nudge to slow down, but I’ve just been politely invited to take a break. By a cat. In sunglasses. With a message: “Too many requests.”

It started with two of my posts, personal, specific, asking the community for help. And help came quickly. I don’t know if the topic was popular, or if I simply found people who understand. But responses arrived, thoughtful ones: advice, reflections, stories. I grew up in the Mesozoic era, where you respond when someone speaks to you. Even briefly, just to say “thank you.” It’s a sign of respect for those who dedicate their time and share their knowledge, freely, generously.

And that’s when the cat appears.

Just to clarify: I’m not creating new posts, not commenting randomly, not spamming. I’m simply replying to those who replied to me. But apparently, my activity is considered excessive. Perhaps too fast, too human and too… old-fashioned?

No complaints. Systems have their rhythms. Maybe it’s just a sign that the culture of response, the one I know, has drifted a bit from the culture of the platform. I hope that one day it’ll be possible to distinguish between a spammer and someone who’s simply listening. Because right now, it feels like the bot can’t quite keep up with me - an old human - and assumes I must be a bot too. Just a slightly faster one. So, safest to… invite me for a coffee break.

I’ll take it. But I’ll be back. Because the conversation matters.

Is this normal?  
What do you think?

I’ve tried PhotoTag, Pixify, and PhotoKeyworder for a while - and honestly, they never felt right.  

I make most of my photos with AI, and keywording them still takes half a day for 5,000 images.  

That kills the creative flow - I just sit and watch progress bars.



And even worse, most of these “AI tools” only describe what they see.  

They don’t understand how buyers search.  

Result: My photos rank low, and I end up manually digging through SEMrush and Google Trends to find real buyer queries.



Out of that frustration, I started building my own workflow - something that could actually handle large batches and think like a buyer.  

After training a model on approximately 50 million real search queries and 10 million stock-photo titles (from Adobe Stock, Shutterstock, and Getty Images), I finally achieved the kind of results I wanted.



The normal speed on other tools is around eight seconds per image.  

Mine now does roughly 1.3 seconds, which means 10,000 photos finish while I’m having coffee.  

Most platforms limit batches to 1,000 files; I pushed it to 5,000 without slowdowns.  

And the output remains clean - CSVs are ready for Adobe and Shutterstock (UTF-8 BOM, with no unusual characters).



It’s not a company ad - it’s something I built for myself that grew into a small project called CyberStock.  

If you want to see what I’m talking about, it’s easy to find on Google.

1ocn64w,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ocn64w/fn_rot_dystopiashort_storyfinished/,[FN] Rot [Dystopia][Short Story][Finished],"“Hear-ye hear-ye! Today marks the 5th anniversary of the horrid disaster,” cried out a young feline boy, waving a newspaper over his head.

 “Today is the 5th anniversary since Neaville’s Spore-Core disaster. Mister, mister, buy a paper, stay up to date with the current situation and the power-struggle.”

The kid called out to a bunny who was passing by. The bunny stopped, turning sleepily toward the city crier who was desperate to sell papers.

“Ugh, fine. What else is new?”

The kid shrugged, “Only know the headlines, mister. 2 spoins please.”

The bunny reached into his overly complicated coin purse, a mechanical device that opened up automatically upon sensing the heat-proximity of his paws.

It hissed as it opened.

He reached in to take out 2 shiny coins with a 1 spore stamped on each of them.

“Now stop shouting, I’m too sleepy for that,” the bunny grumbled as he grabbed the paper. As soon as he turned around to walk away, the kid shouted again, his high-pitched, undeveloped voice, like nails on a chalkboard, sent a shiver down the bunny’s spine.

A few minutes later, armed with a coffee in 1 of his mechanical arms that protruded from the depths of his backpack, the long-eared mechanic folded the newspaper over, reading a few of the headlines.

He yawned, flipping the page over,

“Alas, I’m too tall to join their union, they do have a nice benefits package,” the bunny grumbled to himself, taking a long sip of the steaming--black as the spore-engine’s oil--fluid, that was known as.

The walk to the city center was an exciting one, barely giving room for thinking as at any time a core-powered chariot might try to run you over. Steaming, whistling, tracked wagons rushed past, delivering overworked workers to factories for their 12-hour shifts.

The bunny wished for some morning sun, the warmth of the morning rays, the dew on the leaves, but instead, there was only smog, stench, and the whistle of steam as it escaped the engines, and the groans of machinery. This was no paradise, but it was the only life they now knew.

\#

“Lester?” the guard called out, glaring sharply at the newspaper-distracted bunny whose ears twitched lazily at the sound of his name. He lowered the paper and took another sip of coffee from his mechanical helper-arm.

“Who let the dogs out?”

Lester grinned.

“Hah! Such humor. You know the rules, buddy.”

The guard was a rottweiler standing tall on two strong legs; his arms were each the size of the bunny’s torso.

“Yes yes,” he pulled out his badge and presented it, then took off his tools backpack for examination by the security before being allowed inside.

His gaze lazily wandered around until it fixated on a brand new, sparkling, and shining placard.

No trespassing--violators will be.

A few moments later, he was inside the reactor’s building, navigating the winding hallways that kept splitting off. He followed the blue line--. On the lower floors, he could hardly find any living creatures; an occasional overworked engineer would rush past him while he was rummaging through messes and coils of wires during his inspection.

“The engineering section’s lighting occasionally shorts,” he reminded himself of his task.

 “Random flickering for a few minutes, then stops.”

He paused his work for a deep, long yawn that echoed through the empty halls.

As he reopened his eyes, there was darkness all around. His mechanical arm spread its fingers out, one of them opened up, and from within it a lighter came out.

 it lit up at last--a dim, flickering light that barely illuminated the bundle of wires in the bunny’s hands.

“Hmmmm, nope, wasn’t me,” he concluded, glancing around.

The lights flickered on, then off again, in irregular intervals. It wasn’t like a spontaneous short; it seemed wrong and intentional, as if someone was playing with a light switch, of the entire section. He watched it; his instincts flared up.

\#

There was clomping of hooves. Someone was approaching. His ears twitched, listening cautiously.

 “Again the flickering, so annoying,” groaned a distant creature with a deep, harsh voice.

“Annoying? It’s ominous. Something is wrong. Yesterday’s crew said the reactor went down to 20% output a few times; they couldn’t ID the cause,” somebody whose steps were soft and elegant, replied to the hooved creature.

“Odd,” the deep-voiced creature replied.

 “Anything else?”

“Hmmm, there’s also the--” he paused, peering through the flickering lights at the long-eared shape up ahead, “Talk later.”

\#

Lester’s ears twitched again as he returned his attention to the wiring mess in his hands. The two approached him shortly after.

“Lester!? Didn’t know you were on shift today,” called out the soft-voiced fox.

 “Got called in because of, well, this--” the bunny replied with a hint of irritation in his voice. The lights flickered a few more times, then stopped.

 “Well done, you’ve fixed it,” the ox joked, walking past the B-class mechanic. Lester scuffed in their direction, murmuring under his breath, “Tsk, good for nothing assholes.”

Lester’s inspection lasted a while longer before he found himself even lower, on the floor of the reactor, rummaging through a power panel. His hand brushed up against something unexpectedly soft. He leaned closer, trying to catch a glimpse of what it might be, but the angle wasn’t good; he couldn’t see.

His mechanical arm’s middle finger opened up, a compass emerged from it, pointing in the direction of the nearest loose screw, “Nope, wrong, uhm, ring,” he called out.

The ring finger split open, and from within it emerged a hex-screwdriver.

 “I need Phillips,” he groaned, reaching into his tools pouch.

In that moment, the lights flickered off, not turning back on for a while.

 “Erhmmm,” he paused, looking around suspiciously.

 “Not good,” he gulped.

A few seconds passed before emergency lighting kicked in and sirens blared.

“Emergency Lockdown initiated. 5 minutes until lockdown, evacuate immediately,” the automated system broadcast on the intercom.

Lester did not hesitate; he sprang instantly into action, hopping swiftly in the direction of the nearest exit, leaving behind half of his tools and the opened service panel.

As he dashed on all fours, he remembered reading about the Neaville’s Spore-Core meltdown and the fallout that ensued after; he really did not want to be anywhere near the reactor if it were to melt down. he recalled reading.

Sirens continued to blare in a deafening loudness. The whole building seemingly buzzed with uncontrollable power as the reactor underwent emergency shutdown. Service panels sparkled, fuses blew violently, and some of the emergency lights were exploding from overload.

 “Three minutes until lockdown, all engineering staff-evacuate immediately.”

“B-4 is now under lockdown,” the intercom announced. Lester watched the walls slowly lower as he dashed under them. Hurried hooves behind him, slammed right into the wall, “LESTER! MANUAL OVERRIDE!” a panicked voice called out, “PLEASE!”

Lester glanced quickly at the manual controls panel.

“B-3 lockdown initiating in one minute.”

He knew he had no time. It’d take no less than half a minute to open and then re-seal the lockdown barrier, he had no time, he still had three floors to cover.

 “I’m sorry,” he mumbled, turning and sprinting away.

\#

The alarm blared, scattering his thoughts. Lester jolts awake, panic filling every fiber of his little body.

 “Gah--hah? Already?”

He sighed, slamming his paw on the alarm to shut it off.

 “What a day that was.”

He hopped off the bed and dragged himself to the curtains to pry them open. The street was alive and as noisy as ever.

The tracked wagons were up and running yet again, the crisis was averted, and the city was back to its former self: smog, noise, and endless rush to make money for the Grimswell.

Streets were busy, bustling with the life of a morning rush. The same as always.

“Hear-ye hear-ye. The Grimswell begins construction of a second Spore-Core to accommodate the growing city--hiring new staff. A generous pay and benefits package. Apply today,” the same high-pitched kid shouted. Lester sighed as he approached.

“Let me see that,” he ripped the paper out of the kid’s hands and flipped it open. Not a single mention of a near-meltdown the day prior.

“Corrupt bastards,” Lester rubbed his temples.

A thought crept up on his mind,

Conflicted, he stumbled off in the direction of the Spore-Core to resume his next work shift.

\#

The walk to work was much the same. Rushing chariots, whistling machines, the metallic screech of steel wheels on steel tracks as the spore-engines came to a halt, dropping off workers.

Security, search, and not a mention of the incident last night.

“Erhm, Gorg, what happened yesterday?” he asked after walking past the metal detector, while the guards searched his bag.

“Hmm? What happened yesterday?”

“The uhm, lockdown protocol?”

Lester hesitated.

“Oh, that? Yes yes, the higher-ups said it was an unplanned training. Hah, what jokesters eh? Scared the spores out of a few of our engineers, I’ve heard a few folks got locked in the lower levels, thinking they were done for.”

Lester shuddered,

Smiling anxiously at the guard, Lester nodded.

 “Yeah, hope no more of those.”

And so began his work day on the lower levels again.

Albeit anxious, he performed his duties diligently, tracking down the electrical issues to the same panel where he was working yesterday. While unscrewing the panel to get inside, he heard stampeding hooves rushing in his direction. he thought to himself, turning around just in time to get grabbed by his jumpsuit and lifted off the ground.

“LESTER!”

“Oh, I guess the lockdown truly WAS a training, wasn’t it? Either that or I’m seeing my favorite ghost, Twohorn. How delightful to see you alive and well.”

The ox heaved, his nostrils flared angrily.

 “You left me behind, I should make a stew out of you.”

The bunny shuddered, “Correction, I sprinted ahead of you. You just happened to be too slow. I didn’t engineer these systems.”

“You could’ve,” the ox began, but the bunny interrupted him.

“Yes, and then we’d be both locked in on the B3 instead of B4, that really wouldn’t have gotten either of us saved. Besides, it’s not exactly in my job description to rescue oxes in distress, not even damsels.”

The ox raised his other hand, ready to plant it firmly on the bunny’s face, when a bull and a husky guards approached them.

“That’ll be quite enough. Return to your duties, Class A engineer, Class B mechanic. You are not paid to fight, you’re paid to work. Mr Grimswell does not approve of wasted work time.”

\#

The metallic panel cover clattered to the floor--Lester dropped it in shock.

The soft thing his hand had brushed against yesterday was visible now, and it was certainly not mechanical in nature.

*A mushroom.*

Growing straight out of the power conduit--a high-voltage cable, armored in steel sheathing, carrying through the Spore-Core’s main arteries. Yet there it was, poking through the cracked casing, alive where no life should ever be.

“Holy,” Lester gasped, glancing around.

 “Well, there’s your short-circuiting issue.”

He gulped.

As he reached for it, the power flickered again. He hesitated, then poked it again.

The powers went out.

When he pulled his hand away, the power flickered back on. he thought to himself, rummaging through his tool bag for a pair of bolt-cutters.

“Here goes nothing,” he commented, poking it again to cause a power outage so that the surveillance system malfunctions too.

While the power was off, he swiftly snipped the mushroom with the bolt-cutters and threw it in his toolbag before the lights came back on.

The power was restored, and while he fiddled with other wires, pretending to troubleshoot so as not to be noticed, the lunch time soon approached.

He made his way out of the building swiftly, setting course to his friend’s lab, a little underground augmentation and research laboratory run by the.

Tinkerbit, the Rataunion top-tier engineer and Lester’s close friend, didn’t even need a second look. He was well accustomed to the Bloom-Shrooms and instantly recognized them.

 “Yap, that’s a bloom alright.”

“What? How?”

Tinkerbit shrugged, “Your guess is as good as mine. Perhaps the fungi are resisting the corrupt government too? Who knows, maybe they’re tired of being milked for their power? I mean, everything runs on these damned things: your watch? The blender? All of it. I’d be sabotaging the reactor too if I were them.”

Lester tapped his paw impatiently on the floor, “This is so far above my pay-grade, but we’ve ought to do something.”

Tinkerbit in the meantime was preparing some sort of a chamber, “I’ll keep it yes-yes?”

“Sure,” Lester responded without so much as a second thought.

 “What now?”

Tinkerbit shrugged indifferently while shoving the mushroom inside a thick, metallic canister and then plugging it into some sort of test setup.

“Shut it down yourself? Tell the press? Get the mayor? Leave the city?”

Lester slammed his curled-up fist into the palm of his other hand, “That’s it! I’ll tell the mayor, he’ll shut down the corrupt Grimswell’s Operations, and the city will be safe.”

“Hah, best of luck with that,” Tinkerbit commented, heeding the bunny no attention as his focus was on the now buzzing canister with the Bloom-Shroom that was violently releasing seemingly endless amounts of spores inside the chamber, producing power.

Lester’s gaze momentarily glued to the display that showed *‘2 MHw.’*

A few short moments later--Lester left in haste, his course set on the Mayor’s office.

\#

Lester hustled down the market street, paws tucked into his coat, a cup of coffee in his mechanical arm that he was sipping on impatiently.

He paused at a corner of a junk stall to quickly sell his used cup to the merchant, when his gaze fixated on a pale white-capped tiny mushroom, proudly poking through the seam between two street blocks. Tiny, barely perceivable, and utterly out of place.

He stared at it for a long moment.

Blinking in disbelief and rubbing his eyes, Lester sniffed the air. A faint stench of copper and mildew filled his nostrils when a voice pulled his attention from it.

 “Buying? Selling? Trading? We’ve got offers for all your junk.”

Lester glanced at the merchant; it was, unsurprisingly, a raccoon.

“Uhm, neither,” Lester hurried off, past the merchant.

A few blocks later, he saw a major commotion off in the distance. Police blocked off an entire block. tape fluttered in the wind.

He overheard a local reporter interviewing one of the officers, “A murder? In broad daylight? Unspeakable. Can you share any details?”

“Purpose?” the mayor’s clerk asked in a bored and official tone.

“Everybody says that, the last one was a sloth who complained that the rabbits as neighbors were a risk to the slow-moving communities of this city.”

Lester sighed, “Look, it’s really, really important.”

The clerk slowly traced the appointments list, “Lucky you, must have a bunny’s paw. Mayor is free for the next 15 minutes, I’ll inform him of your visitation. Up the stairs, second floor, big door at the end of the hall,” the clerk informed him.

Lester sprinted off before she even finished her sentence, his ear twisted to pick up the rest of the directions while he hurried up the stairs.

The doors creaked without urgency, and the bunny rushed through them. His breath was ragged, and his fur-a total mess.

“I have a,” Lester began, but then paused when he heard an impatient cough from someone to his left.

He looked there to see a sheep in a gray-patterned suit, grinning knowingly.

 “Mister Grimswell? Ahem w-what are you doing here?”

He swallowed nervously.

Grimswell, the CEO of the Grimswell Worker’s Union Guild, owner of the Spore-Core that powers the city, and the founder behind the very technology that powers everything.

“Oh, me? Don’t mind me, please, do go on about your business, Class-B mechanic, Lestern Nortur.”

Lester clenched his fist and tightened his jaw before returning his attention to the Mayor.

“Sir, the uhm, the Spore-Core is unstable. I, as Mister Grimswell just pointed out, work there and, well, I was there yesterday during the threat of a meltdown,” he continued, but the sheep interrupted him, “During the drill, you mean.”

Lester protested, but his warnings were ignored, disregarded, and overturned against him.

 “Besides, lunch break is long over, is it not? I would hate to see a Class B mechanic’s promising career ruined by, dare I say, incompetence and laziness.”

Lester sighed--it was pointless. The Mayor was bought by the Grimswell, and would do anything the CEO tells him.

The Grimswell grinned, as if a wolf in sheep’s clothes.

 “I assure you, the reactor is perfectly safe. Now, return to your duties at once, or we might be forced to conduct a performance evaluation.”

Lester nodded..

 “Yes, sir.”

\#

Bewildered, but not entirely surprised by his discovery, Lester swiftly returned to Tinkerbit who welcomed him with a grin.

 “Back so soon, was it a success?”

 “No,” Lester replied impatiently.

 “Figures, good thing the Rataunion never acts without plan B, so we’ll skip that one too,” Tinkerbit jumped over from 1 of his workbenches to another one, and tapped his tiny paws on a device the size of a bottle of water.

 “Take it,” Tinkerbit said.

Lester picked up the device and examined it. Inside the glass tube were copper coils that whined and hummed softly, charged and ready for whatever they were created for.

 “What’s this?” he queried, turning it in his paws.

“A scrambler. It won’t kill the core, but it’ll fry every single circuit in the facility, overload everything, shut it down, and likely render it irreparable. Backup systems will shut the reactor down safely and lock it all down. City goes dark but doesn’t turn into Neaville # 2. Catch my drift?”

Lester nodded, “So, I sneak this in past the security, activate it, Spore-Core goes down?”

Tinkerbit chuckled, “No no, no need for special agent stuff, my brethren of the Rataunion will take you in through the sewers and tunnels, we’ll take it out from underneath.”

\#

Days passed. Silence befell the city as the Spore-Core went out of commission, plunging the city into darkness and stillness.

What remaining machines existed ran out of juice within a day.

Factories no longer ran, spore-batteries were not produced.

While the city stood still, the news spread fast, albeit only in oral format.

BREAKING NEWS! At midnight two days ago, the Spore-Core powered down, cause:  *unknown*“. The Grimswell Worker’s Union Guild has yet to make an official statement. The mayor has been missing since then.”

Lester sat on a bench, sipping his coffee while admiring the stillness and silence, grinning ever so faintly. Only he, and a handful of rats knew what had happened. Tinkerbit’s words echoed in his mind.

 “Today is the 5th anniversary since Neaville’s Spore-Core disaster. Mister, mister, buy a paper, stay up to date with the current situation and the power-struggle.”

The kid called out to a bunny who was passing by. The bunny stopped, turning sleepily toward the city crier who was desperate to sell papers.

“Ugh, fine. What else is new?”

The kid shrugged, “Only know the headlines, mister. 2 spoins please.”

The bunny reached into his overly complicated coin purse, a mechanical device that opened up automatically upon sensing the heat-proximity of his paws.

It hissed as it opened.

He reached in to take out 2 shiny coins with a 1 spore stamped on each of them.

“Now stop shouting, I’m too sleepy for that,” the bunny grumbled as he grabbed the paper. As soon as he turned around to walk away, the kid shouted again, his high-pitched, undeveloped voice, like nails on a chalkboard, sent a shiver down the bunny’s spine.

A few minutes later, armed with a coffee in 1 of his mechanical arms that protruded from the depths of his backpack, the long-eared mechanic folded the newspaper over, reading a few of the headlines.

He yawned, flipping the page over,

“Alas, I’m too tall to join their union, they do have a nice benefits package,” the bunny grumbled to himself, taking a long sip of the steaming--black as the spore-engine’s oil--fluid, that was known as.

The walk to the city center was an exciting one, barely giving room for thinking as at any time a core-powered chariot might try to run you over. Steaming, whistling, tracked wagons rushed past, delivering overworked workers to factories for their 12-hour shifts.

The bunny wished for some morning sun, the warmth of the morning rays, the dew on the leaves, but instead, there was only smog, stench, and the whistle of steam as it escaped the engines, and the groans of machinery. This was no paradise, but it was the only life they now knew.

\#

“Lester?” the guard called out, glaring sharply at the newspaper-distracted bunny whose ears twitched lazily at the sound of his name. He lowered the paper and took another sip of coffee from his mechanical helper-arm.

“Who let the dogs out?”

Lester grinned.

“Hah! Such humor. You know the rules, buddy.”

The guard was a rottweiler standing tall on two strong legs; his arms were each the size of the bunny’s torso.

“Yes yes,” he pulled out his badge and presented it, then took off his tools backpack for examination by the security before being allowed inside.

His gaze lazily wandered around until it fixated on a brand new, sparkling, and shining placard.

  
 Spore-CoreProperty of the

No trespassing--violators will be.

A few moments later, he was inside the reactor’s building, navigating the winding hallways that kept splitting off. He followed the blue line--. On the lower floors, he could hardly find any living creatures; an occasional overworked engineer would rush past him while he was rummaging through messes and coils of wires during his inspection.

“The engineering section’s lighting occasionally shorts,” he reminded himself of his task.

 “Random flickering for a few minutes, then stops.”

He paused his work for a deep, long yawn that echoed through the empty halls.

As he reopened his eyes, there was darkness all around. His mechanical arm spread its fingers out, one of them opened up, and from within it a lighter came out.

 it lit up at last--a dim, flickering light that barely illuminated the bundle of wires in the bunny’s hands.

“Hmmmm, nope, wasn’t me,” he concluded, glancing around.

The lights flickered on, then off again, in irregular intervals. It wasn’t like a spontaneous short; it seemed wrong and intentional, as if someone was playing with a light switch, of the entire section. He watched it; his instincts flared up.

\#

There was clomping of hooves. Someone was approaching. His ears twitched, listening cautiously.

 “Again the flickering, so annoying,” groaned a distant creature with a deep, harsh voice.

“Annoying? It’s ominous. Something is wrong. Yesterday’s crew said the reactor went down to 20% output a few times; they couldn’t ID the cause,” somebody whose steps were soft and elegant, replied to the hooved creature.

“Odd,” the deep-voiced creature replied.

 “Anything else?”

“Hmmm, there’s also the--” he paused, peering through the flickering lights at the long-eared shape up ahead, “Talk later.”

\#

Lester’s ears twitched again as he returned his attention to the wiring mess in his hands. The two approached him shortly after.

“Lester!? Didn’t know you were on shift today,” called out the soft-voiced fox.

 “Got called in because of, well, this--” the bunny replied with a hint of irritation in his voice. The lights flickered a few more times, then stopped.

 “Well done, you’ve fixed it,” the ox joked, walking past the B-class mechanic. Lester scuffed in their direction, murmuring under his breath, “Tsk, good for nothing assholes.”

Lester’s inspection lasted a while longer before he found himself even lower, on the floor of the reactor, rummaging through a power panel. His hand brushed up against something unexpectedly soft. He leaned closer, trying to catch a glimpse of what it might be, but the angle wasn’t good; he couldn’t see.

His mechanical arm’s middle finger opened up, a compass emerged from it, pointing in the direction of the nearest loose screw, “Nope, wrong, uhm, ring,” he called out.

The ring finger split open, and from within it emerged a hex-screwdriver.

 “I need Phillips,” he groaned, reaching into his tools pouch.

In that moment, the lights flickered off, not turning back on for a while.

 “Erhmmm,” he paused, looking around suspiciously.

 “Not good,” he gulped.

A few seconds passed before emergency lighting kicked in and sirens blared.

“Emergency Lockdown initiated. 5 minutes until lockdown, evacuate immediately,” the automated system broadcast on the intercom.

Lester did not hesitate; he sprang instantly into action, hopping swiftly in the direction of the nearest exit, leaving behind half of his tools and the opened service panel.

As he dashed on all fours, he remembered reading about the Neaville’s Spore-Core meltdown and the fallout that ensued after; he really did not want to be anywhere near the reactor if it were to melt down. he recalled reading.

Sirens continued to blare in a deafening loudness. The whole building seemingly buzzed with uncontrollable power as the reactor underwent emergency shutdown. Service panels sparkled, fuses blew violently, and some of the emergency lights were exploding from overload.

 “Three minutes until lockdown, all engineering staff-evacuate immediately.”

“B-4 is now under lockdown,” the intercom announced. Lester watched the walls slowly lower as he dashed under them. Hurried hooves behind him, slammed right into the wall, “LESTER! MANUAL OVERRIDE!” a panicked voice called out, “PLEASE!”

Lester glanced quickly at the manual controls panel.

“B-3 lockdown initiating in one minute.”

He knew he had no time. It’d take no less than half a minute to open and then re-seal the lockdown barrier, he had no time, he still had three floors to cover.

 “I’m sorry,” he mumbled, turning and sprinting away.

\#

The alarm blared, scattering his thoughts. Lester jolts awake, panic filling every fiber of his little body.

 “Gah--hah? Already?”

He sighed, slamming his paw on the alarm to shut it off.

 “What a day that was.”

He hopped off the bed and dragged himself to the curtains to pry them open. The street was alive and as noisy as ever.

The tracked wagons were up and running yet again, the crisis was averted, and the city was back to its former self: smog, noise, and endless rush to make money for the Grimswell.

Streets were busy, bustling with the life of a morning rush. The same as always.

“Hear-ye hear-ye. The Grimswell begins construction of a second Spore-Core to accommodate the growing city--hiring new staff. A generous pay and benefits package. Apply today,” the same high-pitched kid shouted. Lester sighed as he approached.

“Let me see that,” he ripped the paper out of the kid’s hands and flipped it open. Not a single mention of a near-meltdown the day prior.

“Corrupt bastards,” Lester rubbed his temples.

A thought crept up on his mind,

Conflicted, he stumbled off in the direction of the Spore-Core to resume his next work shift.

\#

The walk to work was much the same. Rushing chariots, whistling machines, the metallic screech of steel wheels on steel tracks as the spore-engines came to a halt, dropping off workers.

Security, search, and not a mention of the incident last night.

“Erhm, Gorg, what happened yesterday?” he asked after walking past the metal detector, while the guards searched his bag.

“Hmm? What happened yesterday?”

“The uhm, lockdown protocol?”

Lester hesitated.

“Oh, that? Yes yes, the higher-ups said it was an unplanned training. Hah, what jokesters eh? Scared the spores out of a few of our engineers, I’ve heard a few folks got locked in the lower levels, thinking they were done for.”

Lester shuddered,

Smiling anxiously at the guard, Lester nodded.

 “Yeah, hope no more of those.”

And so began his work day on the lower levels again.

Albeit anxious, he performed his duties diligently, tracking down the electrical issues to the same panel where he was working yesterday. While unscrewing the panel to get inside, he heard stampeding hooves rushing in his direction. he thought to himself, turning around just in time to get grabbed by his jumpsuit and lifted off the ground.

“LESTER!”

“Oh, I guess the lockdown truly WAS a training, wasn’t it? Either that or I’m seeing my favorite ghost, Twohorn. How delightful to see you alive and well.”

The ox heaved, his nostrils flared angrily.

 “You left me behind, I should make a stew out of you.”

The bunny shuddered, “Correction, I sprinted ahead of you. You just happened to be too slow. I didn’t engineer these systems.”

“You could’ve,” the ox began, but the bunny interrupted him.

“Yes, and then we’d be both locked in on the B3 instead of B4, that really wouldn’t have gotten either of us saved. Besides, it’s not exactly in my job description to rescue oxes in distress, not even damsels.”

The ox raised his other hand, ready to plant it firmly on the bunny’s face, when a bull and a husky guards approached them.

“That’ll be quite enough. Return to your duties, Class A engineer, Class B mechanic. You are not paid to fight, you’re paid to work. Mr Grimswell does not approve of wasted work time.”

\#

The metallic panel cover clattered to the floor--Lester dropped it in shock.

The soft thing his hand had brushed against yesterday was visible now, and it was certainly not mechanical in nature.

*A mushroom.*

Growing straight out of the power conduit--a high-voltage cable, armored in steel sheathing, carrying through the Spore-Core’s main arteries. Yet there it was, poking through the cracked casing, alive where no life should ever be.

“Holy,” Lester gasped, glancing around.

 “Well, there’s your short-circuiting issue.”

He gulped.

As he reached for it, the power flickered again. He hesitated, then poked it again.

The powers went out.

When he pulled his hand away, the power flickered back on. he thought to himself, rummaging through his tool bag for a pair of bolt-cutters.

“Here goes nothing,” he commented, poking it again to cause a power outage so that the surveillance system malfunctions too.

While the power was off, he swiftly snipped the mushroom with the bolt-cutters and threw it in his toolbag before the lights came back on.

The power was restored, and while he fiddled with other wires, pretending to troubleshoot so as not to be noticed, the lunch time soon approached.

He made his way out of the building swiftly, setting course to his friend’s lab, a little underground augmentation and research laboratory run by the.

\#

Tinkerbit, the Rataunion top-tier engineer and Lester’s close friend, didn’t even need a second look. He was well accustomed to the Bloom-Shrooms and instantly recognized them.

 “Yap, that’s a bloom alright.”

“What? How?”

Tinkerbit shrugged, “Your guess is as good as mine. Perhaps the fungi are resisting the corrupt government too? Who knows, maybe they’re tired of being milked for their power? I mean, everything runs on these damned things: your watch? The blender? All of it. I’d be sabotaging the reactor too if I were them.”

Lester tapped his paw impatiently on the floor, “This is so far above my pay-grade, but we’ve ought to do something.”

Tinkerbit in the meantime was preparing some sort of a chamber, “I’ll keep it yes-yes?”

“Sure,” Lester responded without so much as a second thought.

 “What now?”

Tinkerbit shrugged indifferently while shoving the mushroom inside a thick, metallic canister and then plugging it into some sort of test setup.

“Shut it down yourself? Tell the press? Get the mayor? Leave the city?”

Lester slammed his curled-up fist into the palm of his other hand, “That’s it! I’ll tell the mayor, he’ll shut down the corrupt Grimswell’s Operations, and the city will be safe.”

“Hah, best of luck with that,” Tinkerbit commented, heeding the bunny no attention as his focus was on the now buzzing canister with the Bloom-Shroom that was violently releasing seemingly endless amounts of spores inside the chamber, producing power.

Lester’s gaze momentarily glued to the display that showed *‘2 MHw.’*

A few short moments later--Lester left in haste, his course set on the Mayor’s office.

\#

Lester hustled down the market street, paws tucked into his coat, a cup of coffee in his mechanical arm that he was sipping on impatiently.

He paused at a corner of a junk stall to quickly sell his used cup to the merchant, when his gaze fixated on a pale white-capped tiny mushroom, proudly poking through the seam between two street blocks. Tiny, barely perceivable, and utterly out of place.

He stared at it for a long moment.

Blinking in disbelief and rubbing his eyes, Lester sniffed the air. A faint stench of copper and mildew filled his nostrils when a voice pulled his attention from it.

 “Buying? Selling? Trading? We’ve got offers for all your junk.”

Lester glanced at the merchant; it was, unsurprisingly, a raccoon.

“Uhm, neither,” Lester hurried off, past the merchant.

A few blocks later, he saw a major commotion off in the distance. Police blocked off an entire block. tape fluttered in the wind.

He overheard a local reporter interviewing one of the officers, “A murder? In broad daylight? Unspeakable. Can you share any details?”

The officer hesitated before responding.

 “Uhm, well, no details yet, all we know is that the victim died due to numerous puncture wounds, as if repeatedly stabbed by a large needle-like object. That’s all we can share for now.”

Lester shuddered at the mere thought, the slight possibility of the corrupt Bloom-Spores spreading, and that the meltdown was not a drill yesterday.

He hastened his steps.

\#

“Purpose?” the mayor’s clerk asked in a bored and official tone.

“Emergency, I need to see the mayor immediately,” Lester held up his Class-B Mechanic badge as if it were an official federal agent’s badge that’d grant him access anywhere at any time.

“Everybody says that, the last one was a sloth who complained that the rabbits as neighbors were a risk to the slow-moving communities of this city.”

Lester sighed, “Look, it’s really, really important.”

The clerk slowly traced the appointments list, “Lucky you, must have a bunny’s paw. Mayor is free for the next 15 minutes, I’ll inform him of your visitation. Up the stairs, second floor, big door at the end of the hall,” the clerk informed him.

Lester sprinted off before she even finished her sentence, his ear twisted to pick up the rest of the directions while he hurried up the stairs.

The doors creaked without urgency, and the bunny rushed through them. His breath was ragged, and his fur-a total mess.

 “Mister mayor,” he called out.

The Mayor-a red panda, wearing a clean, black suit--stacked some papers and folded his hands, glancing up at the out-of-breath bunny who just stormed through his doors like an action-movie star.

“I have a,” Lester began, but then paused when he heard an impatient cough from someone to his left.

He looked there to see a sheep in a gray-patterned suit, grinning knowingly.

 “Mister Grimswell? Ahem w-what are you doing here?”

He swallowed nervously.

Grimswell, the CEO of the Grimswell Worker’s Union Guild, owner of the Spore-Core that powers the city, and the founder behind the very technology that powers everything.

“Oh, me? Don’t mind me, please, do go on about your business, Class-B mechanic, Lestern Nortur.”

Lester clenched his fist and tightened his jaw before returning his attention to the Mayor.

“Sir, the uhm, the Spore-Core is unstable. I, as Mister Grimswell just pointed out, work there and, well, I was there yesterday during the threat of a meltdown,” he continued, but the sheep interrupted him, “During the drill, you mean.”

Lester protested, but his warnings were ignored, disregarded, and overturned against him.

 “Besides, lunch break is long over, is it not? I would hate to see a Class B mechanic’s promising career ruined by, dare I say, incompetence and laziness.”

Lester sighed--it was pointless. The Mayor was bought by the Grimswell, and would do anything the CEO tells him.

The Grimswell grinned, as if a wolf in sheep’s clothes.

 “I assure you, the reactor is perfectly safe. Now, return to your duties at once, or we might be forced to conduct a performance evaluation.”

Lester nodded..

Just because youre nice doesnt give you a pass to constantly be cheating, hooking up with multiple girls or leading people on. I Hate when these men say “dating”, we ALL know what you really mean. 👉🏻👌🏻… 📵👻🏃 

I CANNOT get over peter making it so entirely obvious that he asked vail on that coffee date just to get her to drink and be more vulnerable to do something with him. Not only that, stared into her eyes for what seemed like the entire date because “thats how he gets them usually”, then next scene hes in hes like “i am DONE with females at SUR” like my guy, YOU keep asking people out at your JOB, MR MANAGER. 

I genuinely have no idea how i didnt notice this the first time watching. 
Its gross and disappointing to say the least. 
Also to realize that him and stassi “dating” was just him stringing along stassi And katie but “had to choose” is soooo 🤦 

I guess i shouldnt be disappointed to be quite honest, this behavior from men is just so tiring to watch. 
I feel like every show i watch i get to like a man and then i rewatch more carefully and get smacked in the face left and right from their behavior.
Its not exactly morally wrong to be friends with people or like people that are bad at relationships, it happens, but i personally find it so exhausting for people to be amazing friends and generous people but leave absolutely no care or proper love for their partner or atleast have the balls to be HONEST about their intentions with someone. Someone out there WILL fuck you if you just ask, stop asking people on dates and acting like you care about their life just to get them in bed and ghost them the next day or act like nothing happened.

1ocmytx,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1ocmytx/am_i_overracting_my_friend_said_i_was_making_a/,Am I overracting?: My friend said I was making a fool of myself when I confronted her about leaving me on a weekend away,"Me (30 female) and one of my best friends (32 female, let's call her Sara), used to live close, but last year she moved and since then we have decided to do a yearly weekend away to make sure we see each other. Last weekend was our first trip, and we went to Berlin. 

For context, Sara is very independent, she is not in a relationship and has admitted herself in the past that she's not good at compromise and that's why she could never live with someone. I feel like I’m more easygoing, I’ve been with my partner for 10 years, and I'm more of a people pleaser (something I'm trying to work on).

Our trip was Friday to Sunday, we both flew to Berlin from different destinations, and my flight left at 4am, meaning I was up very early. We only had two nights there and Sara had already mentioned that if I was up for it and not too tired, she wanted to go out. On the first night, it was Friday night, and as the opportunity presented itself and I wasn't too tired, I said ok to going out, make the most of the trip. The evening was great and we had a fun time.

The first little dig from Sara came the next morning. We had arranged to put our alarms on for 10:00 am. We both got up, had breakfast and got ready. Sara had a shower first, and after I took a shower; meaning she was ready before me, and she ended up having to wait, at most, about 20 minutes for me. 

As we were leaving the hotel in the lift Sara commented ""We'd better hurry up and make the most of the daylight left"" (it was about 11:15am). I didn't think much of that comment in that moment. For context, that fist day, Sara had very kindly booked a tour for the two of us that we were looking forward to, and it started at 2pm. We had about 2 hours before heading to the tour, and Sara wanted to go and visit a park that was 1 hour walk away. I said ""that won't leave us much time when we get there, maybe we could do the other things we wanted to do in Berlin, such as visit the food market that morning, and leave the park for the next day when we willhave all morning free"". Sara replied, ""we've not got much time left now, we've left the hotel late, maybe I should go off on my own to the park and you can go where you want, and I'll meet you at 2 for the tour"". 

I was a shocked by this, I'm used to her being independant but we'd come on the trip together and I didn't understand what issue she had. I replied ""What do you mean we've left late? We went out last night, we arranged what time we'd set our alarms for, and we've got up and gone out. You are the one who wanted to go out, we could have stayed in and had an early night, and gotten up earlier."" I also said, ""I'm here to spend time with you, I'm not just going to go off on my own, I don't mind where we go, I just think we need to take into account that we need to be at the tour for 2"". After that Sara reluctently agreed, we went to the food hall, went on our tour, and the rest of the day was great. 

The second night, we decided we'd have an early night because we'd been out the evening before, and then we could get up early the next day and go to the park. It was our last day and the plan was to wake up at 8am, check out of the hotel, and head to the park all morning before our flights. 

We did exactly that, got up, packed our bags, and headed downstairs. Sara had booked to have a breakfast in the hotel, whereas I preffered to just grab a coffee to go at the 7Eleven accross the road. I sat with Sara and waited while she ate her breakfast in the hotel. While she was having breakfast we were looking at how to get to the park rather than walk for 1 hour. There was a bus that would take us to exactly where we were going, whereas a metro would add on a 15 min walk. I would obviously have got the bus direct, but Sara said ""I hate buses, I never get them, I'm definitely getting the metro"". So I said ok and went along with it, it wasn't a big deal. She finished breakfast, we checked out, and I went across the road to grab my coffe from the 7Eleven.

I grabbed a pastry and a coffee, and the coffee machine stopped working, meaning it took me an extra 5 minutes to get the coffee as I waited for the guy in the shop to make the coffee machine work. I got my coffee and we were on our way. Everything on the trip so far had been GREAT and we'd had no issues apart from the minor dig the first day, and I THOUGHT we were both looking forward to our last day together.

Once we left the 7Eleven, she started walking off ahead. I was a few steps behind, slightly slower as I finished my pastry and coffee, but behind her. I realised she was walking ahead of me and though it strange she wasn't walking with me, but didn't think much of it, as I thought maybe she was just in her own head and anyway, and didn't think she had anything to be annoyed about. and anyway it was a 3 minute walk to the metro and I was just behind her. 

Sara waited for me at the lift to go down to the metro so I thought no more about it, all good. We got down into the metro station and got to one of the super long escalators which I hate, and Sara started walking off ahead again. So much so I lost sight of her, but again, I didn't think anything was wrong and I imagined she’d be waiting at the bottom. 

When I got to the bottom she was nowhere to be found. Sara had been following the GPS, and I had been following her, but she’d just walked on without me. I looked around everywhere, even exiting and entering the station again, and started to think she’d got on the metro without me. At that point I messaged her and asked where she was, after no reply I messaged ""have you got on the metro without me?"". To that she replied, I'm on platform 12, I was at the bottom of the stairs. 

So I made my way to platform 12 (which was down another corridor and another two escalators) and by this point I couldnt ignore that this behaviour was strange. At what point do you walk off without caring if your friend is with you, when you are on a weekend away together?

I arrived on platform 12 just as the metro was coming in, and I saw Sara afar sat on a bench. I walked towards her and instead of coming towards me, she just got on the metro. I was geniunly not understanting what was heppening at this point, and what was wrong with her. I also got on the metro and walked to where she was, and said ""Whats wrong? Why are you walking off without me? You could have waited."" Sara replied ""I was walking at a normal pace, you were dawdelling""... genuinely not understanting her annoyance I said ""I wasn't dawdelling... you could have waited for me"" to which Sara answered ""Just leave it, you're making a show of yourself"". That last comment caught me completely off guard, I didn't know where at all that was coming from, I was sat next to her on the metro simply asking her why she ran off. In that moment the comment shocked me so much that I just moved away and sat at another seat until our stop.

  
When we got off, she started acting as though nothing had happened. But more than her walking off, I had found that last comment of her saying ""you're making a show of yourself"", really hurtful and mean. It felt like just a way to shut me up and not listen to what I was saying, as I hadn't raised my voice or created any type of scene at all.

I was genuinely hurt by her behaviour, as Sara is one of my best friends and it was supposed to be a nice weekend away together, I said to her ""I don’t know what I’ve done to annoy you this morning that made you walk off, we’re on the trip together, next time can you wait for me"" to which she once again said, this time while smirking ""I'm not arguing with you, you're showing yourself up I front of the German people, just squash it"", half laughing. 

At this point I’d had enough, I was talking to her normally trying to explain my point of view and she was coming back with such a bitchy comment that didn’t even make sense. So I replied ""No, I’m not showing myself up, I’m telling you how I feel, If we come away on holiday together it’s to spend time together, next time you should come alone if you don't want company"" to which Sara answered ""I will"", she also said ""If you thought I was walking ahead, you should have said something, I was walking normally"".

At this point I gave up. I said ""I don't know what I've done to annoy you, I know you're not going to admit anything, but please can you take into account what I'm saying, as if we come away together, it’s to spend time together."" Sara once again replied that she wasn't walking fast, and that's where the conversation ended. 

We went on with the morning before leaving for our respective flights home, but her attitude just hasn’t sat right with me and I don’t know how to feel about it. It's not even the fact that she walked off without me, it's that when I confronted her (completely normally just wanting to know what was up), I was met with a nasty and disrespectful comment, twice. 

The detail on the timeline and what we did, is to try and comprehend if I'm missing something and there is something that could have annoyed her, or a way in which I wasted her time, but I don't believe I did.

I went on the trip with full intentions to have a good time, and I feel like I was met constantly with no flexibility on her part. It's made me genuinly question the friendship, even though she is one of my best and longest friends. It's not the first time she's been super independant and stubborn, and that I can get over, it's the disrespectful and bitchy comment that she's never made before that has thrown me. 

I know after the moment she probably didn't mean what she said, but I felt completely disrepected and don't think I did anything to deserve it. Am I overracting and was the comment she made and her not waiting not that bad? Should I go away again in the future and forget about this? I hate confrontation, and I don't know if I should bring this up with her, forget about it, or end the freindship. Any advice would be greatly apppreciated.

1ocmwc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1ocmwc7/terrible_experience_at_a_baltimore_cat_cafe_i/,Terrible experience at a Baltimore cat cafe I used to love - feeling heartbroken,"I feel sick writing this because I genuinely loved this place so much. I've already posted shorter reviews on Yelp and Google, but I wanted to write out the full story here for anyone who might be considering getting a cat from them. I'm not trying to destroy a small business - I just think people deserve to know about their practices before getting emotionally invested like I did.

I've been wanting to get a cat for a while now, and this cat cafe in Baltimore - with its cute ambience and what I used to believe was kind staff and management - has been my absolute top choice. I lived in Baltimore during the past summer and came here almost every week to look at the cats and stop for a coffee. Since moving to New York about a month ago, I've been browsing their website weekly to see what new babies they have (my boyfriend still lives in Baltimore and I come by every other week, so I still wanted to support this business).

Last Wednesday, I saw a new Siamese cat on their website, and I couldn't resist anymore. My best friend has 2 Siamese cats and this one looked like the perfect first pet for me. I filled out their form with the greatest excitement and also wrote an email to explain my commitment to making this situation work despite being out of state.

Being the over-preparer that I am, I asked my boyfriend to go to the cafe as soon as he could after work to look at the cat himself and communicate my intention with their staff. He got back to me with the great news that one of the staff working there confirmed that I was the first and only person to inquire at that time, and with their system being first come first serve, I have a great chance of being selected, with the only concern being that I am out of state. My boyfriend told them that I can come this Monday, and they said that they don't open on Monday, but I can come Tuesday.

I was beyond excited to hear this. I wanted to reassure them that I am committed to making this process as easy as possible and I can travel to Baltimore as often as they want. I tried calling 10+ times in the following days, wanting to confirm the time the cat will be available on Tuesday, since I know they need resting during the day. No one picked up, and no one replied to my email or my form submission, so I decided the only way to communicate further (since I didn't even know the cat's specific age, breed, or any information except name and gender) would be to come in person.

On Monday, I pushed off all my obligations and came to Baltimore. On Tuesday morning, I came to the cafe bringing a blanket to give to the cat - either to comfort her if she comes home with me, or something to play with if she doesn't. Little did I know, with my only intention of learning more about a possible future kitten, what I was about to hear and be accused of.

I walked into the cafe asking for coffee and whether they have an available spot for the cat lounge today. I explained that I submitted my inquiry and wanted to meet the cat in person as well. The staff was super nice and said there are a few spots available today that I can book. Upon hearing the specific cat that I was inquiring about, the person who I assume is the owner informed me that there is already someone else under consideration for that cat.

I was excited since I thought it was me, being the first, so I said it is probably me since I am first in line. The owner replied by saying ""it turns out there is someone before you, and they're probably gonna get the cat."" He then said he needed to take a call, so I waited in the cafe for more explanation, completely upset about this confusion.

When he returned, he didn't talk to me so I asked whether he might be available for more explanation. After he said yes, I asked whether there are more details on what happened since I came from NY to meet the cat specifically under the impression that I was first in line and had a great chance of being selected.

After rounds of back and forth, I asked whether he has a specific timeline of things, and reason or proof as to why the staff saw my inquiry being the only one while he's claiming there is another one before me. I expressed that I came today not because I assumed I could go home with the kitten today, but because I wanted to hang out with the kitten first and see if we get along, and previous communication with the staff has led me to believe I am first in line.

Here's what I want to make crystal clear, because I think this is the most important part: I honestly don't care if I don't get selected. If they don't like me, they can turn me down in the first place, then consider someone else in line. I would understand and be completely fine with that. I just needed to know why I wasn't first in line for the DECISION. I didn't need to be chosen. I just needed to be the first to be considered since this is what they told my boyfriend. That's it. That's all I wanted to understand.

He proceeded to say I have no right in booking a train to come when no one said I was chosen, and that I am making him uncomfortable by asking for the timeline. This shocked me extremely and I started sobbing because the only intention I had coming here was to communicate since phone calls weren't picked up and emails weren't answered. I wanted to show them how much I cared about this cat and how much I am willing to do, while not assuming I am getting the cat but only that I am first in line to know whether I will be selected.

I want to emphasize this: the owner kept saying he was very uncomfortable, and I said multiple times that I am not trying to make a scene in the store. This entire conversation happened while I was the ONLY customer in the cafe. I specifically told him that had there been any other customer there, I would have asked him to have a private conversation with me outside so other customers wouldn't be disturbed. And in fact, when more people started to come in later, I immediately stopped talking and just said please get back to me. I was trying so hard to be respectful of his business.

I was so frustrated at what I was being accused of, like I am some kind of bully ambushing them and forcing them to give me a kitten, while in reality I only came because no other communication worked and I wanted to show how much I care.

He also said, ""I don't blame you or your boyfriend or the person working here last week."" And I'm just sitting there thinking... what do you mean you don't blame us? How do you even blame us for this situation? What did any of us do wrong? His staff member was being helpful and kind. I was just following up on what I'd been told. The fact that he framed it as a situation involving ""blame"" was so confusing and honestly hurtful.

The owner said at 10:40 that whoever was talking to my boyfriend last week would come in at 11 (I know the time because I looked at my phone and thought I can wait 20 minutes), and I said I can wait for them. Then, after talking for a bit more, at 10:46 he told me that the person will in fact not come in today. He said he needs to get back to me on everything, and he cannot guarantee a timeline. He then left to work on other things, while I cried in the cafe waiting for more explanation.

After about 30 minutes, probably because other customers were noticing me sobbing, he came out again telling me that the cats got here last Monday, he took them to the vet, and the vet emailed him personally last Tuesday with intention to take the cat and my inquiry came Wednesday.

And here's another thing that shows I wasn't trying to trash their business: when customers came over and asked me what happened and said they were there to listen, I said nothing. I didn't tell them anything because they were customers and I didn't want to trash a small business in front of their own customers. Even in that moment, crying and upset, I was still trying to protect their reputation.

I asked whether the process was the Google form on their website or anything else that I am not aware of, and he claimed that while the official process is the Google form, he gets verbal interests from friends too. So basically there's an unofficial system for people he knows personally, which bypasses the first-come-first-serve policy that was explained to me.

He then offered me a free drink or pastry coupon which I denied, because I honestly don't want anything. He said I'd be welcome to get any other cat, and I replied that I do not feel comfortable doing so anymore.

Here's the thing that really, really gets me: honestly, even if I'd walked in and the owner had just said, ""So sorry but the website wasn't updated clearly (since when I inquired it didn't say there's someone else pending), but I have a friend that already wanted it"" - I'd get it. We all have friends, we all prefer our friends to be happy and get the cat if we can. If he had just said ""so sorry but my friend expressed interest on Tuesday and I want them to have priority,"" I'd honestly be fine or at least way less angry. I would've been disappointed, sure, but I would have completely understood.

I am so upset because he explicitly said ""no one forced you to buy a ticket and why did you come here without us choosing you"" and accused me of being aggressive and making him uncomfortable. That's what devastates me. The way he treated me like I'd done something wrong by trying to communicate when literally every other channel failed. I was made to feel like some entitled person harassing them when I was just confused and trying to understand what happened.

I wanted to write this to share my concern for the transparency of their process, and to express my frustration at being accused of the worst. Anyone that knows me knows how respectful I am of other people's spaces and time, and being accused of having no right to come without being chosen sounds bizarre for a business, especially when I couldn't get through via phone or email.

I also really, really pray that he doesn't punish the staff member who helped my boyfriend. At least they'd been nice and were just trying to help someone understand the process. They did absolutely nothing wrong and were only being kind and informative.

To the cafe, if you're reading: I do not demand anything, not even an apology. I only hope for communication and transparency, and I can only beg you to take care of the cats with honesty and diligence to your customers and every cat lover.

Has anyone else had experiences like this? Am I crazy for feeling this upset? I keep replaying everything and wondering if I did something wrong here.",0,1761075887.0,baltimore,1,0.17,False

Her actual behaviour has not improved, but I think she gets the hint now that I won't put up with nonsense, and she has stopped reaching out as often, which is such a relief. 

After a recent trip, I picked them up from the airport to bring them home and made dinner for them and brought it over that night and we visited for a while. This was about 3 weeks ago. They asked us to come over for dinner that weekend, so two days later. This is just a side note, but that night she had a whole table set up with gifts they had brought back from the trip, probably totaling about $500-700 hundred dollars, which I explained I felt uncomfortable taking but she insisted. I also wanted to stay outside with my dog, but she was insisting that I leave her alone in the backyard because she has to show me all these things one by one and brag about how exclusive and expensive they were and how much trouble it was to go out of their way to find these gifts for us. It was so awkward. 

The weekend after that was Thanksgiving (we're in Canada), and she planned a family dinner. I found out they were sick from their trip and decided I would stay home instead. It was really awkward cause she had told me at 1pm that she had a sore throat for days and had lost her voice that morning. So when I said I would rather postpone dinner until everyone felt better, she said no need, we are all feeling perfectly fine! I ended up sticking to my boundary, and didn't go anyway. 

So she invited me over for the following weekend. It wasn't even an invitation, she just said ""hi not sure if DH told you but we're doing family craft night and dinner this weekend, what is your schedule please?"" At this point, I had gotten whatever virus they had from my boyfriend, who continued to go over, including for thanksgiving.  I told her I'd have to pass this weekend since I was sick and really overwhelmed with school since I'm in midterms at school right now. 

She said that's fine, they'll see me when I'm better. Again, because my partner was invited, he went over to his parents and left me home alone while I was sick, even though he had been away all week. She sent home a dessert for me, and I texted to say thank  you, and she replied asking if I wanted to go out for a walk and coffee the next day. Even though I had said I couldn't come to dinner the night before because I was sick, and also really swamped with school. I thought that was kind of weird.

I thought I was off the hook for this weekend because we already have plans to go over to his parents on the Saturday for pumpkin carving. Apparently she still wants to do this craft night on Friday. She didn't even bother asking me directly. She asked my boyfriend to tell me about it, and apparently I'm supposed to come. I feel bad, but I told him that I've made it very clear to his mom that I'd reach out when I had the capacity for a family night once I finished my exams and was feeling better. 

I suppose I could technically go on Friday, and maybe it's petty, but I kind of want to go on my terms, when I don't feel like I'm being forced to. I don't really know what to make of all these invitations all of a sudden, and what to say/do about it. I feel really rude continuously saying no. And I can't figure out if she's just asking because she genuinely wants me to be there, or if it's some type of control, and the not knowing is making me so hesitant to want to go over but I just don't know if it's something I'm imagining!

What is the catch here? I thought PT students usually have to fight very hard to get these coffee chats but now it just comes out of nowhere. Does it mean the firm is signaling me that they want me to apply? Or am I just overthinking it and the 2Y is just fulfilling their obligations as being the ambassador between the school and the firm?

I used PhotoTag, Pixify, and PhotoKeyworder for a while, and honestly, it wasn’t what I expected. I create most of my photos with AI, and keywording them takes **half a day** for 5,000 images.

That kills all the creative flow. I sit and watch progress bars.

And even worse, most of these “AI tools” just describe what they see. They don’t understand how buyers search.

The result? My photos rank low, and I have to redo everything manually, checking SEMrush, Google Trends, and market data to find the real keywords that sell. So I decided to build my own tool,  **CyberStock**.

It’s trained on 50 million real buyer searches and 10 million stock photo titles from Adobe Stock, Shutterstock, and Getty Images.

Initially, I aimed to resolve the speed issue. The usual rate for similar services is **around 8 seconds per image**. Just imagine how much time that is for 10,000 photos. I managed to bring it down to **around 1.3 seconds** per image, and suddenly, keywording thousands of files became something I could finish while drinking coffee.

Then I worked on batch limits. Most tools have a limit of about 1,000 images per batch, which requires frequent restarts. After a few late nights of debugging and pipeline tuning, **I achieved 5,000 per batch** without slowdown.

Another huge issue was relevance. Other tools spit out generic tags like “beautiful”, “nature”, and “outdoor”, which are things no buyer searches for. CyberStock analyzes real buyer queries and generates **buyer-focused keywords** that actually rank and drive sales.

And since I personally upload to Adobe and Shutterstock, I ensured that the export works perfectly, producing ready-to-upload CSVs in **UTF-8 BOM format**, with no weird encoding issues or manual cleanup required.

I also ditched the monthly-subscription nonsense.

1ocmp1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1ocmp1a/i_turned_22_what_i_learned_this_year_isnt_written/,I Turned 22: What I Learned This Year Isn't Written in Books,"It was my birthday yesterday. On the 21st of October, I turned 22 years old. The past year taught me things that aren't written in life's real rulebooks. I learned that the real point of life isn't what happens to you, but how you handle that situation. Now, when any problem comes, big or small, I don't just react upon seeing it. I first pause, think, understand what the problem is and its scale, and only then do I take a calculated step. I don't end up taking any step in a rush like I used to before.

But this year also taught me that a person can sometimes make wrong decisions too. I used to think that making a wrong decision was a failure. Now I understand it's not a failure; it's feedback. If a decision turned out to be wrong, I didn't let it break me or make me admit defeat. Instead, I analyzed where I went wrong and how I can do better next time. Whether it was family, friends, or any other matter... I saw one common thing everywhere: your strength doesn't lie in the size of the problem, but in the way you manage it.

Another thing that was eye-opening this year was the true face of people. Sometimes, even those friends, with whom I had spent long moments, would turn into villains because a third person came into their life or for their own benefit. They bitch about you behind your back, they say bad things about you. I used to think, ""Man, they made one mistake, I should forgive them."" But now I feel that such people are liabilities; they can never become assets. Good friends aren't those who explain to you 10-20 times the situation. Good friends are those who never say anything wrong behind your back. It's better to distance yourself from them, no matter how close they may seem. Because they will never change. In my opinion, a true friend is the one who stands by you at your low point and says, ""Don't worry, we'll handle whatever happens."" That is the real meaning of friendship.

And then there was another part of this year, without which all of this would feel incomplete. That was a chapter of my life that has closed, but its learning will never leave. She taught me what love is. I can never hate her, I can never see her sad. I always want her to be happy. Because her smile, her childlike innocence... how can anyone who knows her hate her? I cannot.

People say that in love, ""self-respect"" matters. This is my personal opinion - I don't believe it does. When you love someone with a true heart, you don't keep a ledger of ""self-respect."" You accept them with all their flaws, and you also help them become better. They show you a mirror of yourself. I also learned that true love never ruins your career or your life. Even if that person is no longer there, it doesn't mean you stop. Instead, for their sake and for your own, you will move forward, you will grow. Even today, sometimes a memory hits me just like that. Like just yesterday, I was going to get coffee and I saw the Kidney Joy board. I remembered, she liked it a lot too. I thought, let me get one... and I smiled. What can you do, life is made of such bittersweet moments, right? Someone once said, ""Where love is true, even distance doesn't end relationships; it gives them more depth.""

So, this was my 21st year - a journey from heartbreak to self-discovery. A year that calmed me, matured me, and gave me a new perspective on life. Turning 22, I feel like I can now understand my feelings, control them, and learn from them. I know what my responsibilities are as a human being. Handling the family, handling myself... sometimes you feel like breaking down from inside, but then you remember that every problem teaches you something before it leaves.

There's still a lot to learn ahead. There will be mistakes too, but I'm not going to be afraid of them. I will learn from them and make myself better.

Below are some helpful tips that I found and that actually work. Was wondering if you all had anything to add.

**Blot Stains, Avoid Rubbing** When spills happen, don’t rub; blot gently with a cleaning solution and cloth. Blot from the stain’s edge to the center to avoid spreading. Rubbing can push stains deeper and damage fibers.

**Utilize Club Soda and Vinegar / Salt & Baking Soda** Use club soda on a cloth to blot beer and wine stains. For stubborn stains, spray a vinegar-water mix, soak 10–15 minutes, then sponge and rinse. Alternatively, sprinkle salt and baking soda, mist with water, scrub, dry, and vacuum the residue.

**The Power of Shaving Cream** For general stains, apply shaving cream and let sit 30 minutes. Blot with a dry white cloth, then spray with equal parts white vinegar and water. Wipe away the solution with a cloth.

**Dish Soap for Greasy Stains** Greasy spills are tough to remove. Mix a few drops of grease-cutting dish soap with warm water, spray on the stain, then blot with a white cloth or paper towels. Repeat if needed, depending on the stain’s size and age.

**Freezing Chewing Gum** If gum sticks to your carpet, freeze it with ice cubes for 30-45 seconds. After it hardens, lift it with a spoon and carefully cut nearby carpet fibers with scissors or a knife to minimize damage.

**Removing Wax with Heat** Wax hardens in carpet fibers can be removed by placing a white cloth over a warm, no-steam iron and pressing until the wax melts. Then, scrape away the softened wax with a butter knife or comb.

**Hydrogen Peroxide for Blood Stains** Blood stains are noticeable. Loosen dried blood with mild detergent and water, scrape off excess, then apply hydrogen peroxide. Let it foam before blotting with a white cloth for effective removal.

**Cleaning Crushed Candy** For candy stuck in carpet, scrape it out with a butter knife. Then, soak with a sponge dipped in mild soapy water to remove sugar. Finally, blot dry with a cotton cloth or paper towels.

**Organic Solutions for Pet Accidents** For pet accidents, use organic cleaners, gentler than chemicals. Apply to stains, scrub, and wipe with a white cloth. These non-toxic cleaners also remove coffee and sauce stains effectively.

**Regular Deep Cleaning** To maintain your carpet’s appearance, deep steam cleaning is essential. This method removes dirt and rejuvenates fibers. For best results, perform a deep carpet cleaning every six months.

James Kempland co-founded Bare Zero Proof Spirits to make non-alcoholic spirits for people that want to socialize without alcohol. The St. Louis-based company celebrated a milestone in its development Friday.

Bare Zero was one of 19 startups that received Arch Grants Startup Competition awards. Arch Grants, a St. Louis nonprofit organization that focuses on building the future economy through entrepreneurship, announced those awards at its neXus Gala.

The organization issued $1.6 million in non-dilutive grants worth $75,000 apiece. Awardees from outside Missouri will receive additional $25,000 grants for relocating to St. Louis.

“Arch Grants enable us to rapidly make more connections,” Kempland said. “In the past few months, they have opened many different doors, given great advice, and they introduce you to multiple people interested in the same business community.”

Over 500 companies went through multiple stages of pitching to Arch Grants, and 75 companies made it to the final stage of the process.

Another of these companies is the Peer Network, a St. Louis-based company with a digital platform that connects people struggling with mental health to trained professional peers on call. Kurt Schmidt, the company’s founder and CEO, said the funding has significance because of his local roots.

“We heard that we were selected as an awardee, which was super exciting,” Schmidt said. “And I’m from St. Louis, so having an impact here locally is pretty cool.”

The 19 startups of the latest cohort range from Digitizer AI, a company that has ambitions of “revolutionizing the embroidery industry” with artificial intelligence, to ChiChi, which makes high-protein cereal from chickpeas, and Petabolix, which provides data-driven meal plans for pets. The companies are:

* Alfa-Ruby - Aberdeen, Idaho
* Archetype - St. Louis
* BARE Zero Proof Spirits - St. Louis
* ChiChi - San Francisco
* Ctrl Shift - St. Louis
* Culture & Co. - Amsterdam, Netherlands
* Decodable Reads - Indianapolis
* Digitizer AI - St. Louis
* Everywhere - St. Louis
* GenAssist - St. Louis
* [Jet.Build](http://Jet.Build) \- St. Louis

* nCase Technologies - St. Louis
* Petabolix - St. Louis
* Remvia - St. Louis
* Show Me The World Coffee - St. Louis
* The Peer Network - St. Louis
* Zaiko - St. Louis

Since it was founded in 2012, Arch Grants has awarded funds to about 270 startups while distributing more than $18.5 million in non-dilutive funding, according to the organization.

Arch Grant startups have helped create over 4,060 jobs in the region and generated $1.2 billion in revenue, according to the organization. To date, 78% of grant recipients identified as women, people of color, immigrants or veterans.",1,1761075058.0,u_mobusinessalert,0,1.0,False

I’ve been trying to make affiliate marketing work for a while. At first, I kept failing — wrong products, wrong audience, zero conversions. 😅

After a few painful mistakes (and a lot of coffee), I finally started earning consistent commissions. Looking back, here are the biggest lessons I learned:

1. Don’t chase every product — focus on one niche and learn it deeply.

Hi, I’m 16F, currently in 11th grade.
Also, this is going to be long, so sorry for that and yeah, I used ChatGPT to frame it nicely because I wanted to express it properly.

I live in a well-off middle-class family. My parents provide everything for me and my siblings. My dad, though… he absolutely adores my sister. Like, even when she’s wrong, I’m the one who gets scolded. It’s fine, I’ve kind of accepted that, but the truth is me and my dad just don’t get along. We barely talk, and whenever we do, it turns into him yelling at me for no reason.

Today, one of my friends came over, and suddenly my dad was acting so nice. He was like, “Make cold coffee for your friend,” and started behaving like the most polite person ever. I already knew what my friend liked, but he kept forcing me anyway, just to look good in front of her. So I did it.

But the second she left, he switched back  called me names, said things like, “You’re useless, you’ll always be useless,” and even worse words. I was just standing there, confused about what I’d even done.

A few hours later, I was doing my work while my sister and cousin were playing games. My dad came into my room and yelled, “Why aren’t you sleeping yet?” I was annoyed and said, “Why are you shouting? I’ll sleep soon. They’re also still awake.” He didn’t like that and slapped me so hard my ear is still hurting.

My mom saw everything. She didn’t say a word, didn’t even try to stop him. Just stood there.

Honestly, my dad has been like this since I was little. He’s been hitting me for years. We can go months even years without talking properly. And sometimes, I feel like I can’t handle this anymore. I think about running away… or even ending it all.

I just don’t know what to do anymore. How do you live in a house where your own father makes you feel unsafe and unwanted?

1ocmfr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ocmfr6/friend_pretended_to_be_me_in_online_review/,Friend pretended to be me in online review,"Several years ago, I had a private wedding and a super low-key reception a couple months later. It was a great day but for a friend’s jealousy really shining through. She had a court house wedding but couldn’t afford any sort of reception until it was too many years for it to really make sense. 

She was not herself at my reception. Typically, she is really cool. She audibly complained about two of the appetizers, the cocktail she had and the cake. She acted like we were remiss in not having a beverage her husband could have. We had soft drinks, coffee and tea. There was an open bar, but he doesn’t drink alcohol. He even interjected and told me that if he wanted something other than water, he would grab a coffee. 

Anyway that backstory is to set up where I’m seeking advice. Over the weekend, a different friend sent me screenshots of a Google review of my venue with a one star by a name that is not mine. She asked why the hell I wrote that review under a fake name. This friend was also at my reception. She said that she loved it, but she went to check lowest reviews of the venue to see if quality had declined because she is considering them to host a shower. 

It was most definitely about my reception but written by the jealous friend, and not as a guest but as the bride. All the complaints were there AND an incident was mentioned that had to do with some drama from a different party in the adjacent space. This review states that the venue really let her down and she wouldn’t host anything there again. 

I am already pretty sure I won’t even mention it to my friend since I think this was probably just her temper tantrum. But if the venue checks their reviews, they probably had a big WTF moment because I did review them very well on Yelp and sent them a thank you card because they really made it nice for something so simple in general. Due to the other party’s drama being mentioned, if they read it at the time, they would have known it was our reception. 

Should I reach out to the venue or just let it go since the reception was not recent? ",1,1761074856.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I do drink a lot of water, and I drink 2 cups of coffee each morning, but the need to pee seems to be getting worse. It feels akin to during pregnancy when there is just constant pressure on my bladder. When I had my period last, it was far worse, and for a day or so it felt like I was carrying around a bowling ball in my pelvic region. Had my last pelvic exam in May? maybe July, can't remember, no issues according to doc. Is this a uterus problem? Is it falling out or down or? The pressure is getting really annoying and even bothers me at night. Goes away a little when I pee but in general it's just a constant feeling of having to pee.

A friend…well, acquaintance of mine has a 3 year old who has additional needs and doesn’t sleep well. She invited me round to her house for a coffee. I agreed to go over and catch up.

We were drinking coffee and chatting about life and her being a mother. She said the child is hard work. I said I imagine all 3 year olds are. 

We talked some more and she told me the child wakes up every couple of hours in the night. I sympathised with her about how hard this must be.

She then confided in me that she often gives the child some alcohol in their cup before bed so that she sleeps longer.

I wanted to look appalled and ask her what the hell she was doing but something in my head switched on and told me to probe further and get more info. So I remained calm and half laughed so that she continued. She told me she does it most nights.

shortly after I made my excuses and left. I was so upset. That poor child. I called the local child protection number and reported everything. Later on as part of some further investigations they got in touch with me to ask if I knew anything about another incident as more information had come to light about further instances of neglect.

I don’t know what happened next. I don’t see or speak to her. She blocked me on everything. Child protection services quite rightly won’t tell me any outcomes. I just hope that child got the help they need.

Never in a million years did I think the woman I knew would do that. They had worked in childcare in the past. It’s terrifying. ",126,1761074498.0,confession,30,0.96,False

Been having fun learning how to dial in with this machine, and sometimes I make great double shots (with a naked portafilter), and sometimes I forget a step and messing it up.  Still having fun.

This morning, I made my shot, and it took over 2 minutes to pull my 40g shot.  Thought maybe I tamped it too hard, so I tried again, and had the same results.  I haven't changed the grind size or the coffee, but what I noticed is that the pump seems to get quieter just before the first drop...and that first drop happens about 30 seconds after turning the machine on now.

I just bought a new steam wand attachment, and what I noticed there is that it starts powerful, but the vortex just kinda dies down, as if the pressure gets lower as the wand works.

Is this a sign of a dying pump?  I have no issue with the idea of buying a new pump and doing my own repair; I just don't know if there's any other form of troubleshooting I need to do first.  I just got the steam wand this week, and thinking maybe trying to steam milk might have exacerbated some issues with the pump?

1ocm681,https://www.reddit.com/r/Because_Now_I_Can/comments/1ocm681/the_peace_i_feel_now/,The peace I feel now.,"I was never meant to amount to much. I was born in a small town hospital in Midwest America. It was the same hospital my dad was born at even. My dad was an over the road truck driver; meaning he was gone Monday through Friday every week. My mom was a recovering drug addict. But in those days, it wasn't walked about. It was her ""youth phase"" or ""her being a kid"" and now she was a parent and that was behind her, so they said. But she was a stay at home sober mom for the first 8 years of my life. She was really my favorite person. We'd go for coffee and juice at her favorite coffee shop when I was very young. I dont remember but she did bring me there once later to show me and that I do have flashes of thankfully. We did all the girl stuff together. I think she was there more for me since dad wasn't. We've always been close. My dad was an alcoholic and the 90s/early 2000s were the end of a very different time. In 2005 my dad neglected his duties as a parent and I was drugged and almost raped. Thankfully I make it safe to my Aunts house and didn't visit my dad again until I was 16. That was also the Christmas I reunited with my best childhood friend shortly before she died. Living in the Southwest for my teen years really saved me but also made me miss a lot with my childhood friends. I often think back to them and have no clue what's happened to most of them. Two of them I miss the most and one I'll never speak to again but maybe I still can with the other. One day. But even those childhood friendships were always strained. I was the poor girl from the trailer park and they all looked down on me to some degree. It was like I knew I couldn't ask my folks for that big birthday party with all my girls from school because we couldn't afford it. And would it have really made me happy? Probably not. I think we all knew that deep down so I never asked and they never offered. Then came the divorce. Even though it was 2000, it was still taboo because small town Midwest was still stuck in leave it to beaver land. Dad moved away to grandma ans grandpa's and mom went off the deep end into drugs. She dated a meth cook, got arrested, and almost lost custody of us kids. But I think she knew that us living with dad would likely kill us, one way or another. So she sobered up and moved us across the country. We went from living in the swamp to the desert in one summer. 

As a young teen, I was using soft drugs while also hanging out with my parents at NA/AA meetings (not at the same time!!). Wild times. As a young adult, I had no clue what to do with my life. I was told go to school, so I did, without any financial literacy. And of course accrued a ton of debt I couldn't pay for because I had no job and the economy was shit. Then I met him. I flunked out my last semester due to my hyperfixation and his love bombing.

Next came 11 years of rollercoaster. I like to think there were times when I was actually happy. But the further I get from that time, the more I realize, I never really was happy. He made me change so much about myself that I don't even recognize the girl from my 20s. Who was she and why did she always look so sick? Stress. I do know why I stayed for so long now. I fell for the ""things will get better when..."" and that milestone just kept moving. He also had me in financial lockdown. But after fighting with me all afternoon the day I received my white coat it was the end. He grabbed my face and pulled me close to him. He let go pretty quickly but it was the moment everything between us broke. I cant even remember if I had sex with him again. I mean I must have the last time he came to visit to get the dog, to keep up the charade until he was gone with his dog. But I dont remember any of it. He knew what was happening. He even made a snide comment about getting the dog and me leaving him. He was right. I filed for divorce less than a month later. With no job, a full time med student with no where to go and just student loan debt to my name. I left him. The night it was decided I was drunk and we were fighting on the phone. Finally he said, I want a divorce and I said you got it and shut off my phone. When I got home I video called my mom on my computer and told her everything. And I never saw him again. 

Next came what I think has been the most peaceful time in my life. I mean its still stressful. When I left him I had no way to pay bills or buy food except my brother and my step dad stepped in to help me get through graduation. They saved me. And my sanity. Im still healing 3 years later and still growing. But at least I'm able to do those things now. 

All that to say I'm so amazed I've come so far after everthing I've dealt with. I've graduated and am a doctor now. That little girl from the trailer park, now a doctor?? No way 😂 I enjoy target shooting my compound bow and journaling and crafting. I'm currently helping people who are struggling with substance use and mental health issues in my 8-5. AND I. AM. HAPPY. 🫶",2,1761074263.0,Because_Now_I_Can,0,1.0,False

TLDR: Increased sweating and BO are usually listed together as side effects, I’ve noticed a smell that seems different to BO and unrelated to sweating.


Preamble: I’m aware of increased sweating as one of the more common side effects, and I owe my dignity to this sub for teaching me how to shop for proper antiperspirants. I know that odor sometimes points to problems with drug metabolism, so I’m hoping to check if this is a common/known experience, before I take it to the doctor.

— graphic-ish details below —
I had noticed it somewhat throughout titration, but after increasing to 60mg I’ve been very aware of a specific odor that is different from my BO even considering that I am sweating more. The scent is bad; something in between piss and butane. It ‘behaves’ similarly to coffee/alcohol/garlic smell, sort of coming from the pores of the skin - which is what I’m suspicious of- regardless of sweatiness, so I think it’s solidly different from regular body odor.",5,1761074256.0,VyvanseADHD,1,1.0,False

I'm (29M) a resident physician who is originally from CA doing my residency in the Bay Area right now. I am applying for fellowship right now and am highly considering Colorado/Denver as my top option. Colorado Children's is a great hospital and highly ranked in the specialty I am doing. I'm also in the mind set of wanting to get out and get a fresh start as I enter my 30's.

Outside of the hospital, I enjoy going out on walks, exploring new restaurants, coffee shops, breweries, cocktail lounges, etc. I'm not one for big clubs and would much prefer going out to bars/cocktail spots. I am also single and am hoping to get out into the dating world in an area of young professionals.

Housing: budget wise would be somewhere in the $1800-$2300 range for an apartment. I'd also like to be in Denver (need to be within 30 mins from the hospital) and have heard good things about cherry creek, RiNo, LoDo areas.

Would love anyones thoughts on apartments/areas to stay? How they like living in denver as a young professional? (Nightlife, dating scene, activities, etc)",3,1761074212.0,MovingtoDenver,2,1.0,False
1ocm4d9,https://i.redd.it/7d6q5kolliwf1.png,Small Collection Review,"Couple months into collecting, this is what I have so far (from best to worst):

1. Khadlaj Island Dreams (9/10): sweet, fresh grapefruit, for me its a great unisex scent for the everyday warm weather day, a few people think it's a bit feminine leaning tho.
2. Hawas Black (8.5/10): woody, mossy, masculine fragrance with a touch of fruit and citrus, opposite of Dreams this is a very masculine scent, projects very well and has a good last ok too.
3. Lattafa Kamrah Qahwa (8.5/10): projects and last like crazy, sweet, cinnamony vanilla with a touch of coffee in the opening, would be higher but I love in the coast and it's difficult to wear if there's no cold outside, great scent tho, perfectly unisex.
4. Hawas Tropical (8/10): love the scent profile, coconuty, green fragrance with a touch of wood in the dry down, projects quite good but doesn't lasts as long at least on my skin, that's what brings it down a notch.
5. Fakhar Black (7.5/10): again not a bad fragrance at all, fruity, sweet opening with a woody aromatic dry down, a great versatile scent, but the projection and duration are a bit poor compared to the others, still would recommend nevertheless.
6. Nautica Voyage (6.5/10): actually not bad at all, you do feel the cucumber, very green, fresh fragrance, but a bit simple, for the price you can do better, but not as bad as some people say.

I could be wrong on some things because I'm new to this, but as a rookie that's my take on these six, also if you have suggestions on which fragrance could I get next to improve this collection, let me know!",5,1761074148.0,fragranceclones,2,1.0,False

I just scored a 276 on Step 2 CK, and wanted to share my experience - especially for other IMGs, residents, or anyone feeling overwhelmed trying to juggle clinical duties and exam prep.

# My Background

* IMG in internal medicine residency
* Took **Step 2 CK before Step 1**
* No dedicated study period - I started lightly around 7–8 months out, but didn’t really focus until the final 2 months
* Only had **1 or 2 days off** total in those last two months - prep was squeezed into evenings, weekends, and whatever scraps of time I could manage

# Resources I Used

* **UWorld** was my main and only real Qbank
   * First pass: I made *a lot* of mistakes, and that’s totally normal - you’re not supposed to know everything right away
   * I treated it as a **learning tool**, not just an assessment. I read every explanation deeply and focused on understanding the concepts
   * Took quick notes in a Word document to reinforce weak areas
   * Did a **second pass** to focus more sharply
* **UpToDate** was helpful to clarify certain topics here and there
* **No Anki, no flashcards, no Amboss Qbank**
* For **ethics**, I did all the UWorld questions and supplemented with a bit of Amboss. Ethics showed up *a lot* on my exam (especially as an IMG), so it’s worth the time

# Practice Scores

I did **all the newer NBMEs**, starting about 3 weeks before my test, roughly one every few days. My scores ranged from the **low 250s to low 270s**, with my last one being around 263 three days before my actual exam.

On **Free 120**, I got around 81%, which felt representative.

I ended up scoring **276** on the real deal - higher than any of my practice exams.

And for those wondering: **yes, the real exam felt more like the NBMEs than UWorld**. It was more straightforward, less wordy, and more about testing understanding than sheer detail recall.

# Test Day Strategy

* I followed a 4-2-1-1 block schedule with breaks in between
* Brought light snacks, chocolate, iced coffee - whatever helped keep my energy up
* Used the noise-canceling headphones they provide - highly recommend
* Most importantly: I made sure to **sleep well the night before**. You really don’t want to be sleep-deprived on test day

# Final Thoughts & Advice

* You **don’t need to memorize everything**. I never did Step 1, and I still managed to crush Step 2. It’s about understanding the concepts, not having a photographic memory
* **NBMEs are valuable**, but don’t waste time doing the older ones - stick to the new ones, use them to spot weaknesses, and review your mistakes
* **Don’t freak out over your UWorld first-pass performance**. I made tons of mistakes in my first pass. It’s normal. That’s how you learn
* If you're working full-time or in residency, it's 100% possible - just takes consistency and smart time use
* And finally, don’t get caught up in “the right way” to study. I didn’t follow anyone’s plan. I didn’t ask around how to study X or Y. I just did what made sense to me - and it worked

If you're an IMG, a resident, or just someone grinding through this, I hope this helps show it's possible. Feel free to drop questions - happy to help!",8,1761074129.0,usmle,2,0.9,False

3. Legroom, overall spaciousness

I travelled 2-way between Pittsburgh and Raleigh. All of the above was as expected, except for the last one. I loved watching the beautiful scenery, walking around freely, relaxing in the cafe car, and fresh coffee. 

Working was hard, mainly due to the extremely janky internet. My work doesn't involve heavy internet usage. Mainly google docs, slack, project management software, some browsing, and occasional huddles. But even that became tough. I had hoped to get 7,8 hours of work in the 14-hour ride, but I must have gotten half.

I do not take pre workout or any other supplements at this time. I have a job in which I have to do cardio regularly it can range from normal to high intensity. 

My metrics are 

24 yo, 
205-210 lbs fluctuating, 
6’0

I also plan to start supplementing the following before during and after the cycle.

Omega-3s,
Vit. D,
Vit. C,
Niacin,
Turmeric, 
Magnesium,
Iron,
Potassium, and 
CoQ-10 ?? Possibly.

I had labs done when I was concerned about my test a month or two ago and my only concern there other than my testosterone levels which I’ve been taking enclo to fix for the past 3-4 weeks are my cholesterol levels which I know rad can mess with. I plan on possibly taking before and during labs but not sure on after.

Total Cholesterol - 135mg/dL
HDL - 57 mg/dL
LDL - 66 mg/dL
Triglycerides - 41 mg/dL
AST - 18 U/L
ALT - 22 U/L

I think this is all of them that are relevant to this, but if I missed anything feel free to ask and I can see if I have results for it. Id like to know if this is sufficient and if there is anything I can improve upon to curate this to a better cycle or if its a good idea at all given my circumstances and alternatives if you have them.

I have two sons who are 7 and 5. My husband and I hired a nanny who lives with us about two months ago. The nanny is a girl in her late 20s. Me and my husband are very happy that we found her. She is very polite, clean, always available for work, very fast with the chores and the children love her.

However, what I don't really like about her behavior is that she all the time goes barefoot in our house. Me and my husband are always wearing socks and slippers while her feet are completely bare. I offered her slippers many times but she declined every single time. I find her habit of going barefoot a bit strange.

I've also seen her resting her feet on our coffee table a few times and once on my son's desk. I feel like she feels too comfortable in our house. Even though she lives in our house, she is still an employee. I am wondering if I should talk to her about her behavior. What should I do?

We met through mutual friends, and I’m the one who introduced her to her now-husband, *Josh* (39M). I watched their whole relationship bloom — from awkward first coffee date to engagement — and everything in between. We went on vacations together (Josh, Lila, Myself and my Husband Cody), our families were close etc. 

A few months before the wedding, Lila called and said she wanted to do a “fun, community-style potluck reception” and asked if I could bring “a few trays” of my famous baked pasta and maybe a dessert. I said sure — until I realized that I’d never received an invitation to the actual wedding.

I figured it was a simple mistake. When I asked about it, she said, *“Oh, we’re keeping the ceremony really small because of space issues. But you’re totally welcome to come to the reception afterward.”*

Alright, fine. I was mid-bake when the photos began to appear online. Turns out, their “tiny” ceremony had **over 200 guests**, and the venue’s capacity was around **1,800**. So space was definitely *not* the problem.

At that point, I felt a little used — like they wanted my food but not my presence. I told her I wouldn’t be cooking after all. I said something like, *“I’m happy for you both, but I don’t feel comfortable catering an event I wasn’t invited to attend.”*

She got icy fast. Said I was “making things awkward” and that she’d “counted on me.” A mutual friend later told me Lila was complaining that I’d “ruined her potluck plan” and that I “made it about myself.”

For the record, I didn’t throw a fit, post anything online, or badmouth her. I just quietly declined and didn’t show up. But now half our friend group thinks I was being petty because “it’s just food” and “she probably didn’t mean to exclude you.”

So… AITA for saying no to cooking for a wedding I wasn’t invited to — even though I introduced the couple in the first place?

\*note\* I had just started baking because of a huge gap between the ceremony and reception for photos, etc... I literally had one pan of pasta in the oven baking. So don't accuse me of wasting food. ",454,1761073790.0,AITAH,160,0.92,False

1oclxqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1oclxqs/my_boyfriend_32m_lied_to_me_32f/,My boyfriend (32m) lied to me (32f),"For context, we’ve been together 6 months and as far as I know, this is the first lie he’s ever told me. Sorry in advance for the long post, but the details are relevant. 

Last month my boyfriend came home from work on a Friday night at around 10pm. I had cooked us dinner and we were preparing for an upcoming trip out of state. 

When he came in he did something he’s never done before, he laid across the bed and was scrolling his phone on his stomach. where he was laying is an end table, an end table that I know he keeps a supply on Suboxone in. 

This immediately piqued my interest, and when I went in the ask him something he responded strangely. 

He finally sat down to eat and oddly enough didn’t finish his whole meal (very out of character). He then started acting erratic and began cleaning and organizing every room in the house.

This lasted for literal hours and the entire time I am asking him “what did you take?” “why are you acting this way?” his response each time is “nothing”

I did not believe him, but I eventually was so sick of seeing him acting that way I went to bed. He came into the bedroom with me and was watching tv and the entire time he kept scratching his face, neck, body. 

Around 7am he gets out of bed, at this point he’d been awake for nearly 22 hours, and makes a cup of coffee. 

Obviously, all of this behavior is abnormal and i’m getting increasingly more uncomfortable. So, I kept asking him to tell me why he was acting so strange, he just denied anything was different. 

He left for the gym at 8:30 and when he did, I check the garbage can he keeps next to the end table and of course there is an empty Suboxone packet. 

I call him and tell him that I just want the truth, did you take it? He said no, of course and the. asked why I was searching in the bottom of the garbage. It must have been old from when he cleaned the drawer out. 

 I couldn’t shake the feeling he was lying and I begged him, still no change. I asked him to take a drug test (which I regretted immediately and recanted I didn’t want to be that person) 

He asked me to trust him and I chose to do so, maybe he was just having a weird episode, too much energy I tried to convince myself. 

He ended up working a 9 hour shift on no sleep, a job where you need to be alert at all times, people’s lives are in his hands. A job where failing a drug test means you’re fired. This is his career and in my brain surely he wouldn’t jeopardize that. 

He made me so sick, I couldn’t eat or sleep and I was having panic attacks. He kept apologizing that he was the reason I was feeling that way, but maintained his innocence. 

He had me questioning my sanity, made me rethink everything I had witnessed. Maybe I was just being paranoid. But I grew up in a household with an addict mother and stepfather. I know what people look like on certain substances. 

The past month has been decent between us and no other incidents. So, I chalked it up to me being afraid of his past addictions. 

Fast forward to last night we went out to dinner, celebrating 6 months together. On the drive home, I finally laid out that I needed the absolute truth from him. No lies. 

He admitted it finally that, yes he took the Suboxone. He panicked when I asked him originally and didn’t want me to judge him. 

I am so crushed that I spent the last 4 weeks making up excuses in my head for his behavior. I’m disgusted that he would lie to me to my face. That he could see me falling apart over his lies and still continue to do it. 

I truly do love him, but I am questioning everything now. He’s broken my trust and I don’t know where to go from here. 


I don’t feel comfortable speaking to anyone in my social/family circle about this. So, please reddit family, where do I go from here?

**And shoppers:** what’s something you wish coordinators understood a little better?

To be honest, I've been experimenting for a couple of days and I'm pretty confused. 

  
For context: Previews experience... I like coffee.



Currently, my settings are:

14 seconds grind time, grind size 16 Y get almost 16g. I get about 34g. I don't want to waste coffee, so tomorrow I'll try more settings.

I tried a finer grind size like 12, but with that setting the espresso gets blocked and almost no water flows through.

**1 question:**  
I guess this is a basic question, but is it normal to get no   
flow? Is the grind size the only factor that causes this?  
This is a pretty newbie question, but the grinder offers a wide range of settings, so moving between 14 and 16 seems pretty restrictive. Can the type of coffee cause the flow to stop?

**2 question:**  
Are the settings on the grinder something that is comparable with other users (same brand and model), so my machine will produce the exact same results as other, or is this very unlikely?  


If helps:  
I'm using Counter Culture Coffee Forty-Six. I didn't research much and it was on sale when I bought it. You know I'm at the level of ""get the second cheapest you can find.""

So I’ve been watching YouTube videos lately on people going on first dates and am just curious if this is in fact what people expect now a days. Where women don’t think going to Applebees or the Cheesecake Factory as acceptable for a first date and are expecting more like a steak house. That even suggesting a coffee date is considered cheap for some reason.

Also seeing these women demanding that the man pay for her nails, hair, and eyelashes because it’s expected for them to pay for their upkeep. Or bringing their friends or even children along on the date or ordering extra meals to take home with them for their kids. 

This is so confusing as if this actually happens. Where if the man isn’t paying for what the woman expects, then they call him cheap or broke. 

Again, these are things I’m seeing on YouTube so please give me your experiences if this is really the case.

Long story short but I have no idea why I have high blood pressure. Except for it being genetics as eveyone in my dads side of the family have high BP including my teen sister who is now on medication. I'm not and have never been on medication.


Anyways, I'm 24, not overweight at all. I'm a size 8(Uk) 4(US) for context. I never drink alcohol (maybe I'll have a cocktail 4 times a year and that's it). Never smoke. Don't do drugs. I don't add salt to my cooking. I have takeout about once a month or less. Eat home cooked meals daily. Don't eat salty food/crisps etc (I have a packet of crisps twice a year). I dont drink energy drinks, mainly only water. Dont drink coffee. It's to the point I get emotional at the amount of restrictions I have compared to other people, like sitting at work eating crisps and I do not feel like I can. I have started the gym 2 months ago and mainly do weights. My work is not stressful apart from the last 2 weeks.


I haven't gone to the doctor about it as I have a phobia of doctors/hospitals. However my sister has gone as her number was high and they did every test under the sun and gave the explanation of “genetics"" and she's now on medication. Which give her a lot of side affects to the point of missing school. 



Pls can anyone share light on what has helped them that I have not already covered? Does the treadmill help on a big level or is it just by a few points?


I don't want to share my number as it's quite high but for context it's 140+

# Chapter Text

I run into the quad wearing my black converse shoes. the band is already set up and getting ready to play. the guy who is the singer is really hot. he has on a dark black leather jacket, a black tshirt, ripped black acid wash black jeans, and combat boots. he has dark hair and red eyes with lots of pale makeup on.

""Whisper what took you so long?"" screeches Jon.

""Sorry it was my stupid sister Skipper. She was making a scene. Shes so dramatic all the time. i hardly had time to get dressed.""

""I like your black skinny jeans and blind 182-crop top with the spiked bracelets and black lace fingerless glovelettes."" said Jon.

""Thanks."" I say to him. ""who is that singer and the band?""

""Deathgrip Raven Vampires is the band. that's gendry. he's the super hot singer. then that's oberynn martell on guitar and robb stark on bass. then on drums that's shae she is so cool.""

""wow I love deathgrip raven vampres!!!"" i scream.

Jon is still kind of a bad guy because of everything he did in the class room but I can't deny he's also so cute with his ebony curly hair and his dark ebony eyes and his dark eyeliner. he has dark nail polish on.

Then suddenly -- Ramsay!!

""Jon what the hell?""

""No Whisper what the hell?"" asked Ramsay. ""I invited you to go to the concert with me and now you are here already but you are with my boyfriend Jon Snow?""

""Ok ok ok what is going on here?""

Jon sighs. ""Nothing is going on here.""

Ramsay sighs to. ""Nothing is going on here.""

I put my hands on my hips and scowl. ""You both are lying to me. I can tell. I am the smartest person at this school. I'm gifted remember.""

""Yeah well we were going here on a date and so I don't know why your here Skipper."" Said Ramsay.

""Oh you did not just call me my sisters name.""

""Yah well whatever you are both pretty much the same.""

""the SAME!??!?!"" I scream. ""THE SAME?!?!?!?!? No!!! We are NOT the same.""

""Ok fine."" Ramsay snorts.

I put my hands on my hips. ""No not fine. Jon what the hell how can you date this simpleton?"" 

""He is good at gay kissing."" Jon says and he swats Ramsay on the butt. Not in a friend way. In a gay way.

""Jon we need to kiss right now. Or I am breaking up with you.""

""Ok.""

We kiss super passionately and I can feel my bra expanding and getting too tight. He puts his hands on my temples and keeps kissing me so hard. Ramsay gets so annoyed so i give him two middle fingers and mouth ""Eff you"" to him while Jon and I continue to kiss. That's when the band comes out to play. it's a cover of ""ocean avenue"" and then it turns out deathgrip raven vampires aren't the only band performing and it is Blink-182. They start to sing ""All The small Things"" and Jon and I jump up and down.

""This is true love isn't it???""

""Yah."" Said Jon.

""Let's dance.""

We danced and then I realized Skipper was there at the concert with her hot new boyfriend who's name I don't know. I storm after her. then I realize she is kissing freaking GENDRY the lead singer of deathgrip raven vampires. 

""Skipper you mediocre tart! what are you doing dating gendry???""

""we're in love Whisper can't yu see that? he's gonna be my boyfriend.""

""yah we're dating."" says gendry. he has gorgeous black eyeliner and a nose ring and he's so freaking hot. he's hotter than ramsay and jon and maybe even jaime.

Jaime runs in. ""What the heck is going on you guys??""

""Skipper is datng the lead singer of deathgrip raven vampires and jon and ramsay left me to do gay kissing.""

""Ok""

I grab Jaime and we start making out in the mosh pit while blink-182 sings ""aliens exist"". ramsay and jon make out too. 

after the concert we go back to my dorm and he sneaks in so no one will see us. skipper and gendry are out on a date so we have the night to ourselves. we continue to kiss and we listen to paramore crushcrushcrush while we kiss. we puts a you-know-what on his boy thingy so I can't get pregnant and we have some sex in skippers bed since it is so much bigger. it is so good. 

""thank you i love you."" he says

""good job i love you."" i tell him.

jaime sneaks back out and I look at myself in the mirror. my piercing purple eyes are glowing bright tnight with happiness. Skipper comes home and she is super arrogant because of her date. i hit her with our tv remote and then the coffee table.

""Skipper I can't believe you."" I grab her by the denim miniskirt and lacefront black faux leather jacket.""i was supposed to be the one to kiss a member of deathgrip raven vampires tonight.""

""Whisper what the hell you have jaime and jon and maybe even ramsay i don't know.""

""oh so your calling me a wh\*re??? is that what thiis is about.?""

""no. i'm sayng you have enough. can't i have one good thing?""

""pound salt skipper."" i glare at her. ""oh also by the way jaime and i used your bed for some sex.""

Or are we simply sleepwalking?","Season 3 of Twin Peaks is beautitul in the sheer number of ways it can be examined. It's prismatic, endless. I want to talk about one thing I've been mulling over as a way of examining The Return, that being an examination of Dale Cooper, of what it means to fail, to not be able to reach the heights of your youth, and how one could reflect on a wasted life when having reached an older age.

# 

# Dougie

I first started thinking of this when reflecting on Dougie's life, and purpose in the show. I suppose I'll start by saying that I believe Dougie *is* Dale Cooper, and is meant to be examined not as a roadblock, getting in the way of 'Cooper' returning, but a continutation of his character from season 2. I believe it's best to examine Dougie in this way, because I think what Dougie represents is the apathetic, regretful life of someone who had an extraordinary youth, who has now grown old and wistful.

The most obvious way to interpret this is to simply look at Dougie and his life, before he swaps with Cooper. He's a fairly competent insurance agent - he has a house, a fine car. He has a nuclear family, and though they have issues they seem fairly steady going. He has his vices, somewhat quaint when compared to the usual Twin Peaks stakes, but vices nonetheless. He's a gambler, cheats on his wife with sex workers, and doesn't seem incredibly present in the family.

To me, these are the typical representation of someone who had a wild youth, but has had to settle. The type who peaked when he was young, and now is 'going through the motions'. He's settled with a wife, and has a kid, but he still thinks himself the womaniser, still flirts with the younger women in the office, still gambles money he can't. It's the picture of someone who is trying to compromise between responsibility that comes with age, and a want (or need) to fulfill some picture of life from their youth that they can't shake off. There's the energy of a somewhat sanitised edgy lifestyle, that most presents itself in middle age. I'm sure everyone knows someone who lives like that.

Now, there is an intepretation of Dale Cooper as that sort of man. The text of the show gives us Dale Cooper as a man who has been trapped in the Black Lodge since the Laura Palmer case, and only returned to the real world 25 years later. Texturally, Cooper could be interpreted as the returning hero, who comes back to us after his prolonged departure to set things straight - but the show seems to go to great lengths to disavow us of that notion. It's obvious that Cooper has not fixed everything (or maybe anything) in basically every point past Mr. C's death. Laura goes missing when he tries to save her, and then you have all of the final episode of twin peaks. Well - if the show doesn't seem to want to give that impression, then what else can we glean?

# A Complete Picture

So imagine Dougie as a direct continuation of Dale Cooper, and what do you get? We should look at the transition between Cooper - Dougie - Cooper - Richard as complete picture, and what does that tell us? I believe it tells us that Cooper is a man who lived a rich early life. He was a hotshot FBI agent, who tapped into psychology and spirituality - he wasn't just solving murders, he was unravelling something greater than that, the very threads of life and existence. He had a naive but confident view of the world that is typically afforded to youth. What happened to him is similar to what happens to most confident youth. He suffered an incredible failure.

Cooper failed with the palmer case. He failed to save Laura, failed to save Madeleine, failed to confront his shadow self in the black lodge. In fact, he suffered a string of failures that more or less erased his existence. When I say 'erased his existence' I mean it metaphorically. We can draw a line between that early hotshot Cooper to Dougie Jones as an abstraction of aging. He went from hotshot FBI man to something more sanitised, more 'on rails'. He was 'gone' for 25 years, and then resurfaced as an insuance man, of all things. This was of course intentional.

Cooper was written to return as Dougie explicitly because Dougie is the sterotypical interpretation of an aging frontman who never made the big leagues. He's a man who had that one shot, and didn't get there. He could have hit the big time, but received a debilitating injury that ruined his chances of going pro. He failed in every way to continue his interesting, youthful life, and he was forced in to what essentially amounts to an early retirement. He dissapears, and on his return he's not Cooper - he can't be. Time has passed (almost inexplicably in some place as outside of time as the black lodge), and he cannot step into the shoes of the young Dale Cooper. Instead, he re-enters into the existence of a man who lost his chance and cannot get over it. An aging hippie, who lived it big in his youth and now exists as a sell out, who works in insurance in a small world, who cannot commit to the recklessless of youth *or* the responsibility of age. Cooper returns to this world to the life of someone who didn't go to the black lodge, but instead had to live with the responsibility of failure and aging.

*We live inside of a dream. Does this mean the same thing each time it is said?*

# Addiction, and aching for Cooper to Return.

I think that The Return uses the language of addiction to examine Cooper's return. I think this exists on two different levels, both in the context of Dougie's life, and in the context of audience expectations. These both play off of each other in various places in the Return.

Firstly, it is no coincidence that when Dale returns within Dougie's body, that gambling is the first thing that he does. Gambling and addiction go hand in hand. Funnily enough - it's the lodge itself that seems to pull Dale towards the jackpots. Though Dougie seemed to have been into gambling, the red room has the most pull here. Dougie follows it - transfixed, like a dog following a sausage on a stick. It could be that the black lodge is leading him there as part of some grander plan to reawaken him as Cooper, but I also think there is significance to this on its most base level. Cooper is surrounded by slot machines, after awakening somewhat in the life of someone who is heavily addicted to gambling, yet the black lodge is the high that he chases - that's the drug of his choice.

Another example is when the Black Lodge seems to assist Dougie in exposing the conspiracy at the insurance agency, Sinclair's tendering of the cases. Again, this is the Black Lodge appearing as a drug, as a high that Dale chases (while Dougie). The allure of a case grabs Dougies attention, a return to his old self, the intoxication of that youthful energy. He wants to be cooper again.

At the same time, we the audience are also in on it. We are intoxicated by Cooper as he was, not as he is now. We want Dougie to become Dale, we ache for the return of Cooper. Each moment with Dougie feels like the prolonged withdrawal, where we're begging for a fix. We see each little part of Dougie interfacing with that old self - the coffee, the Black Lodge, the Cherry pie. We're hoping that one thing leads to another and Cooper is back - with the ache of an ex-smoker that has taken a drag socially and all of a sudden feels that gravitation, that lust for one more. Dougie is being tempted by the black lodge, and we're being tempted by Cooper. It is not that the show is saying that Dale Cooper is actually an addict, but it *is* that that state of being can be like a drug. Dale returns, and the itch returns.

Eventually, all of these impulses, all of these dopamine indicators in a character built to starve us of Dale Cooper, they become almost overwhelming. He does not relapse into that youthful state when he has coffee, not when he has cherry pie, not when he experiences the thrill of a jackpot. But once he hears Gordon Cole's name, it tips him over the edge. It is not that he hears the name and he becomes Coop again - not at all. He hears Gordon's name and what does he do? He makes his way over to the plug socket, and takes a hit. He takes a hit of pure electricity, of pure Lodge space. This is the watershed moment, the moment where Dougie leaves and Dale takes over. This is the bump of coke, the sober cigarette after a week of social smoking. Note that it almost kills him to return to Dale. He wakes up in the hospital.

And what is the crowning moment of this whole affair? Well, it's Diane. Diane, who appears out of nothingness. Diane who wears the colours of the black lodge, who is the physical representation of that lodge space that Cooper, and ourselves have been chasing all season, the return to the comfort in the abnormal, not the apathetic longingness of middle age corporate life. This woman, the woman of Cooper's previous life, who is literally dressed like the lodge, the scenes of that youthful cooper energy in its most embodied form - the source of his greatest failure but also the point where he was closest to greatness.

He has a wife at home, Janey E, but he has abandoned her now for Diane. He leaves his wife and son alone, and goes to a youthful crush, both of them older now, both of them past the point of youthful exhuberance, both of them who had their chance snatched from them but seem to ache to their return. He kisses her now, he has given in, become addicted, become dependant on and happily dependant upon the drug and allure of youth. And just when she appears, who else appears?

# We Live Inside a Dream.

Cooper appears, face superimposed on the screen. Everything is positioned, inside his head now almost, and he lets out those faithful words.

*We Live Inside a Dream*.

A lot of us interpret this to be similar to Lynch's use of the phrase. But remember, it was Gordon Cole who had that enlightenment, the Monicca Belucci dream. Cooper did not. I think, when Cooper says these words, it is not from the perspective of one who has reached a state of understanding about his existence, not one who has, through meditation, been able to intuit some framework of life.

They are the words of someone who has lost 25 years being on autopilot. Of someone who was once creative and important, and interesting, who has now become someone who is part of the corporate machinery, who has all of the components of a fulfilling life, but never devoted himself to it. They are the words of someone who feels like they've lived their whole life in a dream.

He is not the dreamer  who has understood that he is who dreams and then lives inside of the dream. He is the dreamer who has suddenly realised that he has been sleepwalking his entire life. It is the word spoke from a man who has tried to recapture some form of youth, disconnecting from his wife and son, who may have given him some purpose, disconnecting from his career, that he has now peaked at. It is someone who has seen an old fling, from some forgotten youth, and feels like he has finally woken up.

I think the story of Dougie, until the awakening of Cooper in the events of season 3, to be the best possible ending for Cooper. This is the life of a man who has righted some wrongs in his life. Who stopped cheating on his wife. Who made some money and hasn't been gambling since. Who has cleaned up his act at work, ending the womanising, putting effort into his craft, and earned the respect of his family and colleagues and made new friends. But once this all happens, perhaps based on the high of it all, he relapses into Dale Cooper - the man he was, who cannot be recaptured.

# Remember, Richard and Linda.

So we find ourselves at a point where Cooper is now in the driving seat, Cooper being the representation of the youthful energy, that I believe is communicated through the show via the language of addiction and relapse. What are the consequences of of this?

We don't get much of Season 3 when Cooper has returned - but what we do get is definitely a downfall of sorts.  Firstly - if we take this to be a story of a man past his prime who has lost years to inactivity, to sleepwalking through life and now is having somewhat of a crisis, what can we first of all see him doing? It would be attempting to atone for the regrets of his youth. He goes back in time immediately, trying to chase down the source of his greatest failure, the failure in the Laura Palmer case, and attempts to make it right.

This is a self destructive attitude immediately. He knows that by changing the past he will change the future, including himself. He says as much. Yet he does it anyway - and in doing so completely changes the structure of reality. You cannot, of course, go back in time and change the events that lead you to this life. Cooper tries, and Laura dissapears. He has failed, because he failed before. You cannot undo a failure, but you can live with it and improve yourself. Something that Cooper does not attempt to do.

Then, he travels to some other world, apparently with the stated goal of trying to find Laura, instead of saving her. Him and Diane then travel to some unknown place together. Now remember, Diane in this form is existing as an object of his addiction, the focus of his yearning for his youth. She is on board with his plan to begin with, but remember, she is in her own place. Her Tulpa (who I believe we can draw a continuity through her life with, much like with Dougie and Dale), is suffering from her youth, that period taking a heavy toll upon her. When Diane 'comes back', similar to Cooper coming back, she seems to be on board with his plans. She too wishes to reclaim her youth, to return to help Cooper fulfil the finale of the plan. She retakes her role as Cooper's help, as she was in the first 2 seasons.

But after a point, it feels like she grows apart from this idea. She seems on board with it, seems ready to continue on with their plans, until she sees herself, just before they have sex. She seems to perceieve herself now, as if asking herself if this is truly a good idea. She sees herself in the third person, observes herself, comes to some realisation. She then goes ahead with the sex, and then dissappears from the story. Why? It could be as simple as the idea that she is also chasing a youth that she had missed out on - trapped in the red room. She meets up with an old fling from 25 years ago, has sex with him, and then gets cold feet. Is this because she, as a just past middle age woman, had that moment of realisation. That she was about to have sex with her half sister's husband, based on some love that she had in a regrettable youth?

She departs shortly after. She tells 'Richard' that she does not feel like she knows him anymore. She was on board, but she has realised that she was trying to recapture something that has been lost with age. The energy and explosiveness of youth, that is no longer present. Richard goes on alone, this new verison of Cooper, who has perhaps some of the parts of him, but is sloppy with age. He doesn't take the full precautions with his pistol, he lashes out in the diner. He acts like a vigalante, who never made it into law enforcement but believe's he's doing right. With the naivety of a man who hasn't observed himself properly in this self destructive mission he is going on. And with Carrie Page's scream at the end, we all know how well that may have turned out.

# Two Birds with One Stone

In your head, when chasing an ideal of youth, everything should go perfectly, like it was when you were young. You think, I can leave my wife for another woman, I can rekindle the activities of my youth, I can right the wrongs and return to the place I was then, optimistic and interesting. The thing is, nothing can go perfectly. You can tell yourself all of these things - if I do this right, and that right, and the other right, then perhaps I can be Dale Cooper again.

And maybe you can remember 430.

You can get to that next part of the journey.

But it's not Richard and Linda anymore.

It's just Richard. Linda doesn't want anthing to do with you any more.

And by the time it comes to kill two birds with one stone, perhaps you've forgotten exactly what it is to set out to do in the first place.

'What year is it?'

It's hard to remember these days. It's not 1989 any more. You and Diane have grown older, you're different people these days. Maybe you're Dougie, maybe you're richard. But you're not Dale.

As you ask the question, you begin to slouch. That youthful energy has gone. You're old now, you feel it within yourself.

And this woman, this traumatised woman, has been brought back to the source of her trauma - where she was raped, absued, neglected.

And she screams.

As she screams, the dream of being young, of being Dale Cooper again seems to extinguish.

He stopped at the table where he had left the personals bag containing Mrs. Tennyson’s clothes and sighed. 

All that was left now as to bring them to the social worker who would try to return them to the family or, failing that, donate them to a resident or patient in need. 
The social worker’s office was located near one of the dining rooms. Padraig left the bag on the desk and tried to force a smile as he said goodbye to some of the residents and staff on his way out.

He walked past the salon just as Trent McCarthy was locking up. 

“Hey, Pod,” Trent said. “Off for the day?”

“Yeah,” Padraig answered. “I’ve got a date with a box of cinnamon toast crunch and *The Expanse*. I might drive up to the lake first.”

Trent nodded in understanding.

“I was sad to hear about Mrs Tennyson.” He said. 

“Same.” Padraig stood there staring at the floor, hands in his pockets. 

“Do you want to grab a coffee and a pastry?” Trent asked. “I mean if you want to be alone I understand but I know I could do with some sugar and they made turnovers at my favorite  spot.”

After thinking for a moment Padraig looked up and nodded. 

“Maybe I can wait on the Cinnamon Toast Crunch.” 

Cafae Latte smelled of coffee, honey, and baked goods. Trent took Padraig’s order and Padraig found a pair of chairs in a fairly quiet corner. 

“Trent, how lovely to see you!”

“Oh, hi Husniya,” Trent said, greeting the barista he was most familiar with. “How’s the family?”

“Kwalla’s getting taller every minute and Basma and Iman are learning to walk. Asif and I have burned a few calories trying to keep up with them.” Husniya glanced at Padraig. “How are you doing? Your friend seems melancholy.”

Trent gave a sad sigh. 

“Another resident passed away,” he said. “Padraig is a laundry attendant and he was especially close to this one.”

“I’m sorry to hear that. Was this at Sunny Orchard?”
“No,” Trent shook his head. “Padraig works at Lilac Brook. Obviously I can’t go into too much detail about individual residents.”

“Of course.”

“But they had almost six residents pass away just in the past month. It happens a lot in nursing homes for a variety of reasons. Well this time it happened so much that one of the residents insisted it was a ghost horde forming and they called for a wild hunt.”

Husnyia made a surprised noise. 

“Yep. It was quite the circus, all those flying horses, fairies and immortal humans in ancient garb, wielding swords and hauling enchanted cages. I’m happy to say there was no horde after all but King Herla still did a thorough investigation and it turns out he actually recognized one of the residents from his days as a mortal.”

Trent placed his order and remembered the werewolf who had known King Herla when he was just a pup.

As Husniya started to make the drinks, Rethu, the dragon barista in human form asked, “How did the other residents react to the wild hunt?”

“Oh, most of them enjoyed it,” Trent said. “Some of the residents never get visitors and it was a morale boost having some of the warriors just stopping by to chat with them. King Herla even promised to return for a few social events.”

Trent joined Padraig with drinks and pastries in tow. 

“Are you still doing all the free haircuts,” Padraig asked, keeping his voice low. 

“Not out of obligation. Mr Morse passed away and Bob considered the favor paid in full. She gave the remaining business cards to the Fourth Street Soup Kitchen and now I just do a weekly gig there to help people who need a hair cut but can’t afford one.”

“Nice.” They sat and sipped their drinks, enjoying the turnovers and gladiatorial dates. Padraig broke the silence. “I know they say not to get attached but it’s impossible.”

Trent nodded in understanding. 

“Mrs Tennyson only trusted me to do her laundry,” Padraig said. “She had her own detergent and she always asked me when I’d be in next. And I think she was genuinely surprised every time I brought her clothes back clean and folded the same day. She was supposed to go home finally and she wanted me to do her laundry one last time. So I told her when I’d be in, and she asked if I could stop by her room at six o clock to collect her things.”

Padraig closed his eyes tightly, fighting tears. When he composed himself he continued. 

“I got to work for my shift and I saw her sitting outside, enjoying the sun. She was so excited to be going home and I told her I was happy for her and that I’d be at her room at the time we agreed on to get her clothes. She seemed so full of life in that moment and I never for one second imagined she was even sick. I made to sure to fill all of the linen closets and around ten minutes to 6 I go to her unit and to her room, and there she is on the floor, face down. Half the nurses and one of the doctors were surrounding her, taking vitals, trying to help her. She passed away on the way to the hospital.”
Trent took his hand and held it tightly as Padraig silently wept. 

“Pfft.”

A man in his twenties looked up from his phone and when he didn’t get a response he said, “Sorry, I don’t mean to be rude. But you do know that most people who live in those homes were abusive to their kids, right?”

Padraig was too stunned to wipe his eyes but the look of shock started to boil Trent’s blood.

“You may not have been trying to be rude,” Trent said. “But you sure gave it a good shot. We weren’t talking to you.”

“I know, I just can’t help but wonder why you’re crying over some old lady in a nursing home. They’re going to get someone to fill her bed soon enough so you’ll have someone else who hit their kids for flushing the toilet one morning. Frankly, I’m surprised their families even bothered to put them in a nursing home to begin with. I’d have-“

“Shut up.” 

Padraig and Trent looked up as Rethu in their partial dragon form stood over the other man, smoke pouring from their nose. The man swallowed but said, “I was just making conversation.”

“You were sticking your nose where it didn’t belong,” Rethu said. “Lots of people have no choice but to place loved ones in a nursing home or rehab facility. It’s not always because a person was abusive to their kids. Sometimes people just aren’t equipped to take care of the extreme needs of a person with alzheimer’s or dementia. People like my friends here do everything they can to make the lives of residents and patients comfortable and they’re not there to judge what a person may or may not have done in their past. Now go find your beeswax and leave other customers alone, or get out.”

The man took his coffee and made a hasty retreat.

“Thanks Rethu,” Trent said. The magic tip jar popped up and he threw a few dollars in. 

“No problem,” Rethu said, placing a gentle hand on Padraig’s shoulder. “You keep doing what you do.”

1oclh0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1oclh0k/built_an_ai_trip_planner_to_stop_opening_20_tabs/,Built an AI trip planner to stop opening 20 tabs every time I visit a new city - would love feedback before App Store launch,"Hey r/SideProject!

I just finished building **OutVybez** \- an AI-powered trip planner that solves a problem I kept running into: spending hours researching what to do in a new city, only to end up with 20 open tabs and more confusion than when I started.

**The Problem:** Every time I'd visit a new city, I'd Google ""best brunch in Austin,"" get generic listicles, open TripAdvisor, check Yelp, ask ChatGPT... and still not know where to actually go. Plus, those ""best restaurants"" lists don't tell you if a place is good for morning coffee or late-night vibes.

**What I Built:** OutVybez filters activities by **time of day** and **category**. So if you search ""Austin + Dining + Morning,"" you get actual breakfast spots, not dinner restaurants. The AI also learns what you're into and recommends accordingly.

**Features:**

* 🔍 Search any city/location (powered by Mapbox)
* ⏰ Filter by time of day (Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Night)
* 🎯 Filter by category (Dining, Nightlife, Outdoor, Arts, etc.)
* 🤖 AI recommendations based on your preferences
* 📋 Build and save itineraries
* 📍 Real venue data from Yelp API (no fake reviews or SEO spam)

**Tech Stack:**

* Frontend: React (mobile-first design)
* APIs: Yelp Fusion API, Mapbox Geocoding
* Caching: Upstash Redis (this saved me 80% on API costs!)
* Payments: Stripe (7-day free trial → $7.99 monthly)
* Hosting: Vercel

**Current Status:**

* ✅ Soft launched to \~50 beta testers
* ✅ Fixed major bugs (addresses were showing mock data - nightmare)
* ✅ Mobile optimized (nothing cut off anymore!)
* 🔄 Preparing for App Store submission in 2-3 weeks

**Business Model:** Free tier: 5 searches daily, 3 AI messages daily, view-only saved content Premium: $7.99 monthly for unlimited everything

**Biggest Challenges:**

1. **API costs almost killed me** \- Yelp charges $229 monthly for 5,000 API calls. Implementing Redis caching was non-negotiable.
2. **Mobile optimization** \- Buttons getting cut off, modals not displaying properly, iPhone safe areas... took way longer than expected.
3. **Real data accuracy** \- Had to completely remove mock data and ensure Yelp returns accurate venues for ANY location, not just major cities.

**What I'd Love Feedback On:**

* Is the value prop clear? (Does it make sense what problem this solves?)
* Would you actually use this for trip planning?
* Pricing: Is $7.99 monthly reasonable, or should I adjust?
* What features am I missing that would make this a must-have?

**Try it here:** [outvybez.vercel.app](http://outvybez.vercel.app)

Happy to answer any questions about the tech stack, challenges, or decisions I made along the way. Also open to brutal honesty - I need real feedback before I submit to the App Store!

Tips on lowering blood pressure?


Long story short but I have no idea why I have high blood pressure. Except for it being genetics as eveyone in my dads side of the family have high BP including my teen sister who is now on medication. I'm not and have never been on medication.


Anyways, I'm 24, not overweight at all. I'm a size 8(Uk) 4(US) for context. I never drink alcohol (maybe I'll have a cocktail 4 times a year and that's it). Never smoke. Don't do drugs. I don't add salt to my cooking. I have takeout about once a month or less. Eat home cooked meals daily. Don't eat salty food/crisps etc (I have a packet of crisps twice a year). I dont drink energy drinks, mainly only water. Dont drink coffee. It's to the point I get emotional at the amount of restrictions I have compared to other people, like sitting at work eating crisps and I do not feel like I can. I have started the gym 2 months ago and mainly do weights. My work is not stressful apart from the last 2 weeks.


I haven't gone to the doctor about it as I have a phobia of doctors/hospitals. However my sister has gone as her number was high and they did every test under the sun and gave the explanation of “genetics"" and she's now on medication. Which give her a lot of side affects to the point of missing school. 



Pls can anyone share light on what has helped them that I have not already covered? Does the treadmill help on a big level or is it just by a few points?


I don't want to share my number as it's quite high but for context it's 140+. I have had high BP for as long as I can remember it’s not a new thing.

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me.  I am a very genuine person please don’t be shy to message me! 

I am an English guy from the south of England originally 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don’t mind where you are located don’t let the distance put you off 

If you only want to be friends then that’s fine with me too send me a message also I really don’t mind I’d prefer to be friends with women again aged 25-32 that would be great too! 

I’d also like to hear from Asian women too! 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 35 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Please read my post on my profile it has extra information on it that I cant post on this one!

1oclfxf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oclfxf,Several PvZ Endless setups i created and practiced with,"All of these should be able to get arbitrarily far in survival endless as long as they are played correctly. Their gameplay involves spamming fodder plants at gargantuars (puff-shroom and its imitator, sun-shroom and scaredy-shroom), using blover whenever a balloon zombie is too close to the end of the lawn, and (only applies to second and third setups) using ice-shroom at the start of every flag, using coffee bean on it once the bungee zombie's target lands (wait about half a second after this) so as to freeze them while they can take damage (this can consistently take them out no matter where they land, without need of umbrella leaf).

To explain the setups, which all have the same basic mechanics:

•The Gloom-shrooms in the back kill digger zombies before they can attack, i tested and practiced this consistently, you only need two Glooms and to avoid using pumpkin (it increases the hitbox).

•The Winter Melon spam works to 100% ensure full-board slow down, and massive DPS that affects every zombie (even killing pool zombies fast enough to make pool plants near-unkillable even after dozens of flags).

•The Starfruits are essential, they have insane DPS and can be used in spots where other plants would be useless (Threepeater is too weak, Cattail fails in targeting and all others are useless) and are vital to killing gargantuars and zombonis fast enough.

•Gloom-shroom spam in the front is the brilliant part of this strategy, it always kills catapult zombies in lanes 2 and 5 before they can attack, shreds zombonis before they can hurt any plants, kills giga-gargantuars without failure, deals with pool zombies in an instant and gets rid of all fodder zombies.

•Fume-shrooms (in the setups where it is exposed) are meant to supplement DPS and be cheap fodder if the other fodder plants fail to keep gargantuars at bay, they will then be replaced and the cycle repeated.

•The combination here makes it so all zombies are negated and outclassed, none of them can attack any plants because the splash damage and infinite pierce of all the attackers can keep any arbitrary amount of zombies at bay. The use of Ice-shroom should also separate zombonies from other zombies and allow them to be dealt with without distractions, which allows for catapult zombies to be dealt with next, this also prevents jack-in-the-box explosions and gives more time for giga-gargantuars.

And, of course, the Twin-sunflowers are here for sun production, they actually produce more sun than necessary for upkeep, so insta-use plants can be easily allowed in too without any meaningful strain on sun reserves! More variations will be developed in the future, but meanwhile, ASK ME ANYTHING!!! (related to these builds)",3,1761072660.0,PlantsVSZombies,4,0.81,False

Ever heard of **Work-Study programs** and wondered if they’re actually worth it?  
If you’re juggling classes, rent, and ramen noodles, this might be one of the most practical ways to cover college costs *without drowning in loans.*

**🎓 What is Work-Study (and Why You Should Care)**

Work-Study lets college students work **part-time jobs that fit around their class schedule**. The goal: help pay for tuition, books, or living expenses, and gain real experience while you’re at it.

Think of it as a blend between financial aid and career training.  
You’re not just earning money, you’re building your resume.

**💰 How It Helps You Manage College Costs**

* You **get paid regularly**, not in a lump sum. That means steady cash flow for rent, food, or that endless coffee habit.
* **No repayment.** Unlike loans, this is *your* money — no interest attached.
* It helps you **budget smarter** and avoid credit card debt.
* Best part? Work-Study income doesn’t reduce your eligibility for other federal aid next year.

**🧾 How to Qualify**

1. **Fill out the FAFSA** — that’s where it starts.
2. Mark “Yes” when asked if you’re interested in Work-Study.
3. Wait for your school’s financial aid office to confirm eligibility.
4. Apply early — funds and jobs are limited, and they go *fast.*

💡 Tip: If you already got your FAFSA done, reach out to your financial aid office and ask if they still have open Work-Study spots. Some schools reopen positions mid-semester!

**🧑‍💼 What Kind of Jobs Can You Get?**

* **On campus:** library, tutoring, research assistant, event support.
* **Off campus:** community service, schools, or nonprofits.
* Some jobs even relate to your **major** (great for future resumes).

These aren’t random part-time gigs, many align with your studies or help your community. Employers also get support from federal funding, so they love hiring Work-Study students.

**🌟 Why It’s More Than Just a Paycheck**

Besides earning money, you’ll:

* Learn to manage time like a pro.
* Gain leadership and teamwork experience.
* Build professional references before you even graduate.

And if you’re smart about it, you can combine **Work-Study + grants + scholarships** to seriously lower how much you owe after college.

**TL;DR:**

**Work-Study = part-time campus job + financial aid + career experience.**  
**It’s one of the easiest ways to make college more affordable, and future you will thank you for it.**

1oclabw,https://www.reddit.com/r/haobinism/comments/1oclabw/haobin_fights_compilation/,Haobin fights compilation,"One of our members requested it a while ago so here it is😘 It's missing some links because I couldn't find everything and twitter's search function sucks nowadays but if I find them/remember anything else, I'll add it here! From this compilation you can tell fighting/bickering a lot is a focal point of their relationship however you can also tell they're kinda overdramatic about what they call a fight or not lmao


-Let's start with a visual example of haobin ""fighting"": https://x.com/colattie/status/1980257586688442786 (I love this clip so so much)

-The tingle fight: At the end of the haobin tingle, haobin share that they had a huge fight right after the finale that ended up making their relationship stronger. Hao adds that it made him realise a weakness in his personality and made him a better Zhang Hao, they've been asked about this but iirc said they didn't want to talk about it and that they're over it basically.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=goRkrO0YNn8

-Petty backstage fights rumours: We've talked about this before but there's some rumours that haobin used to bicker backstage and act really childish by asking staff to pass stuff for each other instead of doing it themselves lmao

-Hanbin saying they fight a lot in a fs during in bloom: This was the first haobin fight repo but I cannot find it anywhere, in it Hanbin(or Hao ?) says they fight a lot and to ease tension they go quiet as to not upset eachother when they're already sensitive (in bloom era was very difficult for all the members)

-Hanbin taking bad pictures of Hao: pretty self explanatory lmao https://x.com/bean_nd_racoon/status/1684227711219400705?t=NJHjDdjiNgCre4Bb7z57Kg&s=19

-Hao coming on live after a fight with Hanbin: Iconic haobin moment of Hao saying on live that he just had a fight with hanbin before this and then saying it's not that serious and that friends fight all the time (something like this would never happen these days! They were so media untrained and open back then, it was cute)
https://x.com/haobinology/status/1720851189896479135?t=yIePih6nVwhfhCOI991A2A&s=19
https://x.com/haobinology/status/1720852557436715042?t=NAIZtMPl1RK9A72PHXYzkg&s=19

-Hao thinks he gets over fights faster than hambin/Hao thinks he's easier to coax: I saw a Chinese fan saying Hao here is more saying he's easier to coax after a fight because he forgets what they fought about fast lmao
https://x.com/jangbingz/status/1728659694229783017?t=jDaZSZ2kwdrYRITByPuI7Q&s=19

-Poland tinhatting: we've talked about this a few times on the sub but here's a proper theory timeline: https://x.com/happynbday/status/1906548436058673283?t=VO-HBLOYDPR03axjdJaFPQ&s=19 basically for two years straight now it's been a huge rumour on the Korean and Chinese side that haobin had a big, maybe their biggest fight in Poland, haobin never confirmed it, during the concert and at the airport they didn't interact at all, zb1 didn't perform here I am, and Hanbin posted pictures with everyone in London besides Hao (London was right before Poland) 

-Them saying they go quiet to not piss eo off when they're mad at eo: basically what I described in the in bloom era repo but there was another one last year where hanbin said the same thing that I can't find either 

-Hao saying that when Hanbin is in the wrong when they fight, he approaches him by saying ""let's talk"", he adds that he says it all the time which matches with other fight repos
https://x.com/bintietiehao/status/1751246957610484079?t=KWYfaMPS0VB7nKWBM_DE2Q&s=19

-Them now promising each other to tell each other straight up when they're upset: while in the past they would go quiet now Hao says he doesn't keep it in when he's upset about something and if he does something that upset Hanbin, he also wants him to tell him right away
https://x.com/bn_0100/status/1800024564652781569?t=co132sJQy1QX8_2fKYkfcA&s=19

-The jeju fight : when asked about a tmi from their jeju trip, Hao said he and hanbin had a small argument that was solved quickly however , cmiiw I'm pretty sure 2binz said there was no fights so he might just be dramatic lmao https://m.weibo.cn/status/5049245399521281?jumpfrom=weibocom

-Hao saying hanbin wronged him: I can't find the repo but it's a famous one, Hao jokingly tells a fan that hanbin wronged him and that she should go scold him for him, we later learn that the wronged him in question was hanbin lightly pushing him on a tiktok LMAO

-Hao saying the words he's told hanbin that he wish he could take back are ""You bad guy"" https://x.com/bn_0100/status/1813519498433163741?t=wVpCr5ymkYU8LOdUQEIuLw&s=19

-Hao saying their married couple dynamic is because they fight a lot and that both apologize, it's not Hanbin everytime LMAO https://x.com/bintomyhaose/status/1898889454070423949?t=HU0BMMxFBJlx6jIU-qACqA&s=19

-Hao saying he does it first (apologising/coaxing)because hanbin won't do it if he doesn't do it lmao https://m.weibo.cn/status/PiNI2hWjw?jumpfrom=weibocom

-Hanbin also saying part of the reason they have married couple chemistry is because they bicker/fight a lot, although they haven't been fighting lately https://x.com/bintomyhaose/status/1898728007734591812?t=sTdEvjfNiTDKz6fPTRk6hw&s=19

-The iconic picture frame story : For haos 24th birthday, Hanbin gives him a huge framed picture of them together that they took on the day they met Haos mom for the first time, Hao calls it his most memorable gift from that year and his favourite gift by Hanbin, the funny thing about this story though, is that right before taking this picture they had a fight
https://x.com/summerskybin/status/1900274939581878625?t=SPlE3e8BRp2sXjaR94AjKw&s=19https://x.com/bn_0100/status/1906544403252224044?s=19
The frame in question https://x.com/sunghaobin/status/1913624435849839015?t=RIjxByGvw1jkZ1YHx_3hkA&s=19

-Gyubin saying he wears headphones when haobin fight  lmao https://x.com/jangbingz/status/1901169867581256087?t=ytuIIqei5vzes4Vo3j7VCg&s=19

-Hanbin explaining how they act when they fight; he goes to Hao , says ""Let's talk"" and if he's in the wrong he apologises and they go eat together
https://x.com/bn_0100/status/1909260141574365358?t=fxkjKbgWujSqbQnbmc6b-A&s=19

-The iconic suit yourself story: Hao says this is their funniest fight story, he was upset with Hanbin but he didn't want to argue so he leaves and hanbin texts him ""suit yourself""
https://x.com/zho_shb/status/1908923487680692309?t=7ixheNQL0N3y7JarQp6CTQ&s=19
The funny thing is hanbin once gave a fan advice for handling arguments that really sounded like how he acted here but I can't find it lmao

-The hanbin eating with friends story: I can't find this one either, I think it was only on weibo, anyway, iirc Hao said he was upset recently that Hanbin went out to eat with friends without telling him and specified that he would have been fine with it if he did tell him

-Hao saying he's been apologising for two years and Hanbin has also made him cry a lot all this time: Also a repo I can't find, Hanbin once was asked if Hao made him cry and he said yes (#whoremembers ""I cry and laugh a lot thanks to Hyung) and when Hao was asked about this he said he's been apologising for this for a while and that hanbin also made him cry plenty since 

-Them saying recently that Hanbin coaxes Hao when he's upset: this is a recent one but I can't find it, it seems like in the past Hao would go coax Hanbin first but nowadays Hanbin does

-Matthew teasing them about fighting: this clip is so funny , Matthew asks with what member Hanbin fights the most and Hanbin mouthes Hao , the knowing smiles of the members are so funny https://x.com/sunghaobin/status/1906024688809070937?t=1vA1ajE0UgmqYlqtMDamig&s=19

-Salon drip: Hao says he became better in Korean through bickering with Hanbin https://x.com/summerskybin/status/1894477100889117050?t=ApLWI7XqOYnbUjIRXtRkeg&s=19

-Hanbin saying lovers need to fight: a hanbin repo I can't find about him saying lovers need to fight (not completely related, not completely unrelated, ykwim)

-Milk choco vs coffee: this is what haobin call ""fights ""..hanbin saying a drink is coffee while Hao says it's hot chocolate...
https://x.com/sunghaobin/status/1884614905485013356?t=wq5x-hsizVzf0433zpeiig&s=19

-Hanbin saying they fight over mundane/unimportant stuffs, and that it's really not about serious things like jealousy (like fans imagine)

That isn’t to say I resented her, she just lived faster than me. She started dating in middle school, and by the time she was a senior in high school she had over ten ex-boyfriends, I was never sure of the exact number. She was beautiful and smart and everyone loved her. Our mother seemed to make it her life's mission to make me envy her, but I never did.

When she married her husband at twenty everyone said she was rushing into it. They looked for a reason that she wouldn't give.

“She must be after his money,” No. He was a normal guy with a normal job, he didn’t make that much more than her.

“She must be pregnant,"" No. It took months after their engagement announcement for the actual day to come, and she was still her skinny self.

“There has to be some secret reason,” No. She simply loved him, and he loved her, so why wait.

My sister simply lived faster than most people, so it's only natural that tragedy came for her fast. Five years, it's not a lot of time to spend with the love of your life, but that's all the time she got. Some rare form of lung cancer took her husband away before they could even have kids. His life insurance plan was somehow good enough to mean that she could quit her job and live her life as a retired widow, at least for a couple years.

That was the last I heard of her before my life took me out of the country, traveling the world researching different culture’s mythology. That was the last I heard, until she pulled me back. I was visiting our mother after spending the better part of the year traveling when she remembered my sister’s message. Two months after I left, my sister asked our mom about me. She wanted me to visit and tell her about some myth she stumbled upon. I felt bad leaving so soon after her husband died, so I gathered my stuff and went to spend my time home with my sister.

I had expected a mess, her to answer the door in a black gown with mascara tears. My mother said she was still “in the throes of grief,” but when she answered the door with a smile and a hug, I was surprised. We sat and talked, drinking coffee, and she seemed totally okay. Then I heard the banging, loud and sharp, coming from upstairs. She frantically checked the time and excused herself. I saw her practically run into the kitchen, then upstairs. I heard the groan of an old door and it was quiet for a while. She apologized from upstairs about taking so long, then she came back into the living room wearing a different shirt.

After that she got right to business. She had found some stories about Seppelt, an old German religion that is out of practice. She wanted to know more about it but I told that it would be hard due to not many Seppelt writings surviving today. From what we can piece together we can tell that these people were basically anti-Egyptians, death was the worst thing that could happen to you. Their worship, ritual, what being anti-death meant is all lost, the only thing surviving is the words of old people who heard stories of stories. The world's oldest game of telephone.

I told her as much but it didn’t seem to satisfy her. She told me that she found a ritual online, one apparently the Seppelt people used to cheat death. I told her that there were no records of rituals like that and that it was probably fake.

Then she simply said “It worked.”

She led me upstairs to a dark wood door. I wasn’t prepared for what I found behind it. Shacked to the wall was the decaying corpse of her husband, crouched over a raw stake, gnawing and coving it in a sickly green mucus. He noticed us and let out a groan as he stood up. The whole room seemed to be rotting and the lack of light made everything worse.

She told me he can’t be out in the sun, and he needs to eat raw meat. Apparently he was fine when she first resurrected him, he was a bit rotten but his mind was there. But soon he decayed more and grew feral. That's why she called me, to find something to fix him. He pulled against the chain and spit out some of that green mucus, almost getting some on me. I saw it sink into the wood, accelerating its rot.

I told her that I knew someone who had more interest in Seppelt culture than me. I could call him and find out what he knew, but that again, there was no surviving Seppelt ritual, and that she could have found something else mistakenly called Seppelt. She hugged me thanking me and I didn’t have the heart to tell her the truth. That what she was doing was wrong. That she needed to let go.

I called my friend and told him what I saw. He was immediately interested and wanted to see this zombie, so I invited him over. That night I heard a loud sharp knocking and a groan. The next day my friend was here, he had apparently dropped everything. After talking with my sister he practically jumped off the couch when she invited him upstairs. He was amazed and I didn’t know which man was more disgusting. He poked at her husband with a long stick and I couldn’t stand the smell anymore, so I went outside. I had just finally relaxed when I heard a scream.

Rushing back upstairs I saw my sister standing in shock in the doorway. My friend was collapsed in a heap, her husband was over him, eating. I wanted to rush in to save him, but his eyes and warped smile made me freeze. My sister had her hand on her mouth, tears bubbling in her eyes. I watched as her husband ate, his skin gaining color, the rotted tears in his body healing. When he was done, leaving nothing but bone, he was completely healed. He smiled and called my sister’s name. She finally broke, rushing at him arms wide and smiling, crying happy tears. They held each other for a long time, over the bone and rags of my friend. I waited for him to suddenly tear into her but he never did. Instead she unlocked his shackle and he walked up to me, thanking me, before going to his room to change out of his rotten clothes. My sister stood in the room and smiled at me.

Short men (not derogatory) seem to obsess and sometimes fetishize my height but to tall men, I'm always a friend and nothing more. 

The last straw came last week. There's this guy (6'1) at office who I've a crush on for a long time and I've made it obvious to him. We go on runs and have coffee together sometimes. Since the last week all his questions have been about my friend (5'1). I feel so sad about it. My friend (F) doesn't give a damm about this guy, he's not her type but he keeps pursuing her. And here I am, crying over this douche. 

The other guys who I had liked in the past who were tall - they were all into short girls too. I just don't understand. Is this a pattern? For reference, I'm decent looking, have a bit of muscle, an athletic build, and get a some attention wherever I go. So it's definitely not a looks issue. I've been told I'm hot by few people (although I've my own insecurities to believe that it's true). 

Am I doomed? Will I not find a tall guy at all? Atleast a guy who is 5'9 with whom I can vibe? 

Please give me some hope. I've been feeling like shit since last week. I don't want to hate the way I look, especially my height but the way things are going with me...I'm not liking it. I don't want to consider my height a curse. 

I know I'm sounding childish but it's really affecting my confidence and self concept. ",0,1761072037.0,tall,112,0.47,False

Started august 1st. I did the whole 180. Stopped drinking (alcohol) almost entirely, from 7 days a week to now 1 day.

Cut down all the junk food i hate daily. A pepsi here, a sugary redbull there, always a bag of doritos in the pantry, something with chocolate redily available. Gone.

I started going to the gym, first two weeks i went a bit too hardcore, 7 or 6 day straight no break. I'm now going steady 4 or 5 days a week and highly enjoy it. The big thing was hiring a trainer! Just to make some programs and show me the machines, that was the intimidating part for me before i began. It's worth every penny.

Lastly, omad. I was already kind of doing it for years almost. Something i would have a crappy breakfast sandwich (timmies or mcdonalds) hashbrown, coffee with sugar. No lunch, and i would eat at night followed by eating junk to suppress the hunger. Junkfood is really addictive, its designed that way. Hard-ish at first mostly because of the habit. 

My omad consist of mostly one regular meal, followed by my daily greek yogurth/frozen berries/granola. Almost 7 days a week.

I put a little bit of milk in my single morning coffee, i dont mind.

I lost 27 pounds on the scale. Hopefuly i've gained some muscle and the fat loss is more than 27, who knows.

This weekend i was cleaning my dresser, and decided to try some pants i bought 6 months ago byt never wore because they were way too tight. They fit like a charm today. I'm so happy, just wanted to share. Thanks folks!",49,1761072015.0,omad,8,1.0,False

So I went down a research rabbit hole on what actually helps people focus. Turns out there are two techniques with solid scientific backing that work even better together.

**1. The Pomodoro Technique (and why 25 minutes isn't random)**  
  
Francesco Cirillo's original 2006 research found that our brains can maintain peak focus for about 25 minutes before attention quality drops. After that, you're just pretending to study.  
  
The key findings:   

1.  25-min focused work = optimal attention span  
2. 5-min breaks restore focus capacity 
3. This cycle prevents mental fatigue way better than ""study for 3 hours straight""

A 2019 study on time-boxing and academic performance found students using Pomodoro:

1. Scored 12% higher on average
2. Procrastinated 35% less
3. Actually remembered what they studied (wild concept)

**2. Body Doubling (the reason libraries work)**  
  
Ever notice you study better at a library or coffee shop than alone in your room? That's not just vibes - it's science.  
""Body doubling"" is working in the presence of others. Research from 2018 (focused on ADHD but applies to everyone) found:

1. 40% more tasks completed when others are present
2. Works even if you don't interact with them
3. The presence alone creates accountability

This is backed by Zajonc's Social Facilitation Theory (1965) - the simple awareness that others are working makes you work harder. It's like going to the gym - you push yourself more when others are there.

*Combining them = study cheat code*  
  
Can't always get to a library? Virtual body doubling is a thing now. I built an app for this (PurFocus) because I was tired of studying alone in my apartment. You join a ""room"" and see other people studying in real-time - no video, no talking, just presence and timers.   
Kind of like a silent study hall but digital. (Not trying to sell anything - there's a generous free version. **First 50 people get premium free.** I just wanted to solve this for myself.)  
  
Link if curious: [https://apps.apple.com/app/purfocus/id6753272206](https://apps.apple.com/app/purfocus/id6753272206)   
  
**TL;DR:**  

1. Pomodoro (25/5 cycles) = scientifically proven to maintain focus 
2. Body doubling (working near others) = 40% productivity boost  
3. Combine them = actually get shit done",1,1761071920.0,studytips,3,1.0,False

Z.B.Steele reached out to me and requested to come here with Nicholas Fuller & Jeff Brown to talk about a certain podcast on the 23rd. This should be loads of fun. 

Secondly, an indie author called Lizabeth Phoenix asked if she could come on the 25th from 12pm-8pm to talk about her book. Details below. 

AUTHOR BIO

Lizabeth Phoenix is the woman in the corner of the room, neck-deep in coffee, face buried in her beloved MacBook. She's also hatching wild plots, dreaming up dragon names, and charting time-traveler visits. Her life’s goal is to write morally midnight characters and battle-cry-worthy victories because light shines brightest in darkness.
 
When not writing or fighting the South Carolina heat, she spends hours immersed in the worlds of A Song of Ice and Fire and Elden Ring. One might say she's a little obsessed...

ABOUT THE BOOK

Perfect for fans of Game of Thrones, Elden Ring, Transformers, Vikings, Peaky Blinders, and Bloodborne, THE GIFTED KING pits villain against villain and brother against brother in an epic tale of lost love and man versus the divine.

Meet Vhogare, the MC:
The second-born son of Anchora's oldest king, Vhogare lived his life dancing just outside of the rules, every risk carefully hidden beneath an artful mask of courtesy. But when he encounters a rogue horseman heralding the end of his world, no place for honor remains. Desperate and determined, he steps up to play the celestial game—a mortal among the hearts of stars. As the sand slides through his hourglass, will he save the world he loves, or will he forsake the shield for the sword?

THE GIFTED KING is book one in THE PHOENIX UNIVERSE, a vast, interconnected grimdark saga of multiple planned series and standalones following a heartbreaking celestial rebellion, the machinations of a rogue, ruthless horseman, and the bloodline of Gift Bearers and heroes who face him on the final battlefield.

I hope y’all are excited and ready to drop some questions.

# Why Social Media Matters More Than Ever 

Travelers don’t just use Google anymore—they rely on **Instagram, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok** to inspire their next trip. A study by Expedia Group Media Solutions revealed that 70% of Gen Z and Millennial travelers decide on accommodations after watching travel videos.

Here’s why social media is essential for hosts:

* **Visibility:** Short-form content reaches millions at minimal cost.
* **Authenticity:** Guests trust videos more than ads or listings.
* **Engagement:** Comments and messages build a personal connection before booking.

Your Llivo listing deserves to live where your audience spends their time—and that’s in their social feed.

Learn how to drive more bookings.

**1. Show, Don’t Sell** 

Forget polished ads. Viewers want to feel your space, not be sold to. Focus your short-form videos on experiences, not features.

Try these quick content ideas:

*  Morning views from your balcony with a coffee mug.
*  Airport pickup moment with a smile—your guest arrives stress-free.
*  Sunset timelapse at your property.
*  **Pet-friendly stays** or cozy family dinners around the table.

**Pro Tip:** Add text overlays like “Free airport pickup” or “Hidden gem in Dallas” to highlight your perks without sounding salesy.

[See how to create standout listings](https://www.llivo.com/p/create-standout-listing).

# 2. Master the Algorithm Without Losing Your Voice 

Social platforms reward consistency and engagement. The more you post and interact, the more visibility your content gains. But remember: authenticity wins every time.

**What works best:**

* Keep videos **under 30 seconds** with a clear hook in the first 3 seconds.
* Use trending **sounds and hashtags** relevant to travel or your city.
* Post 3–5 times per week to maintain algorithmic visibility.
* Encourage viewers to comment (“Where would you stay next?”).

Llivo helps hosts understand performance through built-in analytics and SEO insights—making it the **best short term vacation rental company** for creators who want data-backed visibility.



# 3. Turn Your Followers into Guests 

You don’t need thousands of followers to make social media work. You just need *the right* ones.

Here’s how to convert viewers into real bookings:

* Add your **Llivo listing link** in your Instagram or TikTok bio.
* Include **CTA captions** like “Book your stay now through Llivo.”
* Share behind-the-scenes stories—people love seeing the human side of hosting.
* Reply quickly to comments or DMs to maintain trust.

The goal is not just to entertain—it’s to invite. Every view is a potential guest.

Explore how hosts build guest relationships.



# 4. Collaborate with Travelers and Creators 

**Micro-influencers** and **travel vloggers** can amplify your reach. Offer them a free night’s stay or transport-included experience in exchange for content.

Choose creators who align with your target market:

* Adventure lovers for mountain cabins
* Couples for romantic getaways
* Digital nomads for long-term stays with Wi-Fi and workspace

Authentic collaboration adds social proof and drives organic exposure—two factors that boost both trust and bookings.

I’m excited to share that I’m currently working on my very first novel! I’m five chapters in and would love to hear your thoughts. The story draws inspiration from *Outlander*, *A Discovery of Witches*, classic Norse mythology, and *The Sword of Truth* series.

This is my first full-length writing project, so I’m still learning as I go. Any kind and constructive feedback would mean the world to me. Thank you all for taking the time to read and support this new creative journey!

Thanks!

**Chapter One: Flung Through Time**

Flynn Andrews believed Salem was more alive with ghosts than people. Not in the literal sense, though the tourists crowding Essex Street in October might disagree, but in the way the past clung to the air. Every brick, every cobblestone seemed to whisper if you listened long enough.

Most days, Flynn did. He was a historian, which in Salem was a little like being a sailor in a harbor town. Every third person claimed the title, but only a few truly lived it. Flynn lived it.

And he didn’t live it alone.

Beside him, always, was Lissy. His steadfast and calm four-legged companion.

She was a large shepherd mix with a soft champagne coat that caught the light like silk. Her ochre brown eyes carried a weight that sometimes unsettled even Flynn. It was as if she knew things he couldn’t. As if she were human.  He’d found her on a rainy night many years ago. From the first moment she had looked at him, it felt less like he’d chosen her and more like she’d chosen him.

“C’mon, girl,” he murmured that Monday morning, sliding into his jacket in his tiny one-bedroom apartment while she watched him with her usual calm intensity. “Gotta make money to afford this shoebox.”

Her ears perked, and her tail swept the floor once before she trotted to the door.

Monday was museum day. Flynn gave a walking lecture on Puritan justice to a group of college students. Lissy wasn’t allowed inside, but she waited patiently outside the Peabody Essex, tied loosely to the bench she’d claimed as her own. By the time Flynn came back out, flushed from speaking, admirers surrounded Lissy. A group of tourists knelt beside her, stroking her fur.

“She’s so calm,” one woman said.

Flynn grinned. “She’s the brains of the operation. I just tell stories.” This was a regular occurrence. Lissy loved people and people loved Lissy.

That evening, Flynn’s mom dropped by his apartment with groceries. This too was a regular occurrence. She couldn’t help herself, and Flynn loved it. Even though he would never admit it to her.

“You’re running on coffee and trail mix again,” she scolded gently as she stacked food in his fridge. Flynn could see her sneak in a few homemade treats when she thought he wasn’t looking.

“History waits for no man,” Flynn said, only half joking.

“And no dog, apparently,” she added, giving Lissy a treat from her purse. Lissy accepted it gracefully, as if accepting tribute.

 Tuesday brought a call from his sister, Joy. She was studying Business Management in Boston and had a way of speaking as though she were already halfway to saving the world.

“You’ve got to visit me this weekend,” she urged. “There’s life beyond colonial trial records, you know.”

Flynn smirked, sprawled across his couch while Lissy rested her head on his legs.

“I don’t know,” he said. “Salem’s ghosts might miss me.”

“They’ll survive,” Joy shot back. “Seriously, Flynn. You need a bit of adventure.”

 He promised to think about it, though both knew the archives would likely win.

Wednesday was for family. He rode his bike across town, Lissy running beside him,  to his grandparents’ white clapboard house, where the windows always smelled faintly of cinnamon, the ivy grew bountifully in the front garden, and the atmosphere was always like home. His grandmother set tea and pumpkin bread on the table. She was a warm and kind woman. Her eyes sparkled with adventure just like Flynn's.  His grandfather, a tall, tan complexioned man, quizzed him about work. His grandfather, to most others, was a hard and serious man. To those that he loved most, he was a jokester and a total goofball.

“You’ve got the Andrews nose for stories,” his grandfather said, tapping the side of his own weathered nose. “But you’ve also got to watch where it leads you. Curiosity will open doors—and not all doors should be opened.”

Flynn chuckled, brushing crumbs from his notebook. “I’ll keep that in mind.”

At his feet, Lissy sat like a sentry, gaze fixed on the window, as if she were listening to something beyond the conversation.

By Thursday, Flynn had fallen back into rhythm: museum tours, a few hours buried in archives, then his evening walks through Salem's wooded parks with Lissy padding faithfully at his side. But something was different. He couldn’t shake the dreams.

A tall man with eyes like molten red, staring at him through the haze of sleep.

Flynn told no one about them. Not his mom. Not Joy, not even his grandparents. But Lissy seemed to sense his unease. She followed him more closely, her ochre eyes locking with his whenever he drifted too far into thought.

That evening, he and Lissy walked to the Salem Common. They were headed for their normal forest route in Highland Park. The leaves were just beginning to turn, and the early autumn air carried a sharpness that raised goosebumps along his arms. The park was quiet, shadows long against the grass.

Flynn paused at the edge of the field, breathing in the crisp air. Lissy stopped beside him, regal and steady as always, her fur glowing faintly in the last rays of autumn sunlight.

He glanced down at her now as she trotted beside him. She was a large dog, but there was something regal about the way she carried herself. It was as if she knew things that Flynn couldn’t even begin to understand. 

“Lissy,” Flynn said, “want to go for our daily walk through the woods?” 

Lissy turned her head, fixing him with a hard gaze. This was a normal routine for them. Work and then their daily walk through Salem Woods. 

 Flynn couldn’t shake a feeling that was pricking the back of his mind. A strange and uneasy feeling. He’d had these strange dreams recently.  He saw fire, blood, and ice. He saw a man—tall, strong, with curly dark hair and eyes that seemed to burn with an otherworldly intensity. He had no idea why he couldn’t seem to shake these dreams, but they felt real. Too real.

As the pair walked deeper into the woods, the wind picked up. The trees groaned, and Flynn felt a strange pull in his chest, as if the world was shifting.

Then, without warning, the air seemed to shatter—like a veil being ripped open—and green clouds erupted around him, swirling and thick, as though the very fabric of time had torn itself wide.

Flynn’s breath caught in his throat. His entire body tingled, a strange electric rush crackling through him, as if the earth itself was alive and calling him. The world around him blurred, shifting, stretching. And in the chaos, he heard something that made his blood run cold.

A voice. A man’s voice. Soft, familiar, and comforting. It was whispering his name.

“Flynn…”

He blinked, trying to focus, but the world around him was spiraling out of control. Lissy, ever the steady force, barked once before her shape dissolved into the mist, leaving only the sound of her retreating steps behind.

 …

“Lissy?” Flynn shouted, but his voice was swallowed by the swirling green. “LISSY!” He thought he heard the sound of her padding away. 

Before he could process what was happening, the world tilted on its axis, and the ground beneath his feet seemed to vanish. It felt as if something pulled him downward through empty air. Flynn’s stomach lurched as he fell, free falling through a vortex of light and shadow. Angry roilng green clouds obscuring his vision. 

And then… silence.

When Flynn opened his eyes, he wasn’t sure he was still in Salem. He didn’t recognize anything around him. 

He blinked several times, his vision adjusting to the dim twilight. His first thought was that he had to be dreaming, or maybe he’d hit his head during the fall. The last thing he remembered was the rush of wind, the flash of light, and then… nothing. Was he dreaming? 

But the reality around him was all too real. The trees were thick and towering, the air sharp with the chill of the north. Snow dotted the ground in patches, and the air was heavy with the smell of wood smoke.

Lissy was gone. Vanished, as if she had never been there at all.

Flynn stumbled to his feet, brushing off the snow from his clothes. He was in jeans and a leather jacket. Flynn wasn't sure why but they suddenly felt out of place.  His heart hammered in his chest as he glanced around, trying to make sense of where he was. This couldn’t be real. Could it?

“Alright, alright,” he muttered to himself. “This is fine. This is totally fine. Maybe I’m in some weird historical re-enactment or something. Yeah, that makes sense.” Flynn was unsuccessfully trying to convince himself this was normal.

 He chuckled nervously, but the sound of footsteps broke him from his rambling thoughts. Flynn froze, every instinct in his body screaming at him to be quiet.

Through the trees, he saw movement. A figure, tall and broad-shouldered, emerging from the forest. Flynn held his breath, unsure whether to run, but the man didn’t seem hostile. He wasn’t in a rush, and there was an air of purpose to his steps.

Then, the figure stepped fully into the clearing, and Flynn’s breath caught in his throat.

He was looking at a man dressed in fur and leather, with a dark mane of curly hair that neatly tumbled over his broad shoulders. His eyes were a deep, fierce amber with a sparkling intensity. It was like a fire backlit old-fashioned brown glass. He appeared strong, and, strangely, seemed as if he had stepped out of the past, as though the world had shifted to make room for him. He looked, for lack of a better comparison, like a Viking. 

“Who are you?” The Viking said, his voice low and steady, and commanding. “What are you doing here?”

 Flynn swallowed hard, his mouth suddenly dry.

“I… I think I’m lost,” he said, forcing a smile. “And… you wouldn’t happen to know how to get back to Salem, would you?”

Just then, Lissy bounded toward him, her large form cutting through the snow. The Viking reached for his axe.  Flynn’s heart lifted at the sight of his trusty shepherd, her champagne colored fur shimmering against the stark white landscape. Her deep ochre eyes locked onto his, and he couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief. At least he wasn’t alone.

""Lissy!"" Flynn laughed, his voice a little more nervous than he meant. “You’re ok!” 

She trotted up to him, her head tilting as if to say, Where the hell are we, before sitting down at his feet with a soft woof, her calm presence grounding him. 

The Viking’s eyes flicked down to Lissy, who had positioned herself protectively by Flynn’s side, and then back up to Flynn. His hand relaxed back at his side. He gazed into the dog's eyes. There was something ancient in those eyes, something that seemed to hold centuries of stories.

 “I see you have… a companion,” the Viking said warmly, his voice deep but surprisingly warm. Somehow familiar.  He spoke with an accent that was thick, yet Flynn could understand every word as though the language itself was filtering through the strange magic of this place.

“Yeah,” Flynn replied, brushing snow off his jacket. “She’s… my dog. Lissy. And, uh, I’m Flynn Andrews.” He gave the Viking a grin, as if his sudden arrival in a world of unknowns wasn’t entirely freaking him out. “I’m guessing I’m not in Salem anymore, huh?”

The Viking stepped closer, his amber eyes narrowing thoughtfully. “Salem?” He glanced around as if the word didn’t quite register. “Where is that?”

Flynn scratched his head. “Right. Not in Salem, obviously.” He looked around again, noticing the towering trees and the distant smoke rising from what looked like a settlement. “Where exactly am I?”

“You are in the wild north,” the Viking said with a sense of finality, as if that answered everything. “This is my land. A place where the wind howls, and the spirits of fire and ice walk among us. I am the Jarl of these lands. You may call me Jarl Eric. Warrior of the Flame Axe”

Flynn opened his mouth to ask more questions, but something stopped him. The Viking was watching him with quiet intensity, as though weighing him, deciding something without saying.

A loud crash broke the silence.

Both Flynn and the Viking spun in the direction of the sound. Footsteps crunching through the snow, followed by the sharp howl of a distant creature. Eric's eyes hardened, and he immediately reached for the axe slung across his back, his movements quick and practiced. His eyes seemed to crackle with flames. Lissy's fur bristled, and she shifted into a defensive stance.

“What was that?” Flynn asked, his heart beginning to race. He wanted to ask more, but his instincts told him it was time to move.

“It sounds like a dire wolf,”  Eric muttered, but his voice was steady. “We must go, quickly. It would be difficult to take them down alone. We will be safe in the village.”

Before Flynn could protest, Eric was already striding toward the settlement which was barely visible in the distance. Flynn hesitated, looking down at Lissy, who gave him an expectant look. Her deep eyes now glowing faintly in the growing twilight. He knew she would follow him, whatever he decided.

I figured out an overnight “oats” recipe with ¼ cup fiber mix + ¼ cup rye flakes + ¾ cup unsweetened vanilla almond milk that has the texture of oats but not the spike (for me). 

I skipped coffee one day and had a zero sugar Dr. Pepper with caffeine. No spike. I’ve been using zero sugar creamer by Carnation for about 15 years so I was confused until I checked the label: corn syrup! Obviously an ingredient change but for two days now I’ve used sugar free coffee syrup and unsweetened almond milk in my coffee with no spike. 🤷‍♀️ VERY irritating.

I’m a 33M, married for about a year and a half. My wife is a wonderful, loving person ,we share the same tastes, love food, travel, and we barely argued in our first year.

But for the past few months, she’s been going through intense mood swings during her periods. She’ll be calm and affectionate one moment, then suddenly upset or angry, often saying hurtful things and later feeling guilty or apologizing then it repeats. It’s confusing and emotionally exhausting for both of us.

Yesterday things went bad. She said in the morning we shouldn’t spend money on food and could cook at home. I went out, bought her favorite chicken, and started cleaning and cooking. She even helped for a bit, and it felt nice. Then suddenly she got upset, saying I was heartless to make her cook during her period and that I should’ve bought biriyani instead. I was shocked because it was her idea not to order food. I didn’t argue just quietly finished cooking while she shouted.

I got overwhelmed and went to my parents’ house for a few hours. Later she messaged angrily, then apologized. I went back, we made peace, ate, cried a bit, and watched a movie together. But later that night, she got upset again because I didn’t make her evening coffee while my friends visited. She said I didn’t care about her and left to her parents’ home.

Now she says she doesn’t want to come back. She’s completely normal and loving on other days this only happens during her periods, so I truly think it’s hormonal or emotional. I suggested counseling so I could understand better, but she got hurt, thinking I called her crazy. That wasn’t my intention at all.

I love her deeply and just want to learn how to support her without making things worse. If any women here can share how their partners help or what might make it easier, I’d really appreciate it.

Thank you for reading, hope someone could help me😔🙏🏿.",1,1761071376.0,AskIndianWomen,7,0.56,False

So I followed and again had to adjust dial left and right to get again 1:2 ration and I got 28g out in 24 secs today. Added 100g milk, 1 teaspoon brown sugar but still coffee is too bitter. If I do more coarse adjustment then I get 28-30g out in just 15-18 seconds. I don't know what's wrong here. I thought I need to dial 1:2 in 25-30 seconds. I get better coffee in my kaldipress.

1ockr69,https://www.reddit.com/r/wavywebsurf/comments/1ockr69/never_ever_trust_anybody/,Never Ever Trust Anybody,"This is a warning to everybody who see's this. One day I met a man. I was at a hotel in the town I lived in and I decided to go to one of the local hotels to look for work. I took a bus to get there and when I arrived, I went to the office. The owner was an Indian man that couldn't talk. They wrote on a chalk board there is no work. I thanked them for the information and left. After I left I knocked on a door where that man was. They opened the door and said you may come in. To be clear I will not use my real name. That is to stay anonymous. Because of that I will use the name George.

 

 

 

I asked the man what their name was. They said Aaron. I said my name is George. You seem to be quite the man Aaron because you are alone here at the hotel. This could be a dangerous place. Aaron answered I am aware of that George. But I am not concerned. We had a long conversation. Eventually I asked that man since you are that type of person would you ever consider disappearing. Also, if you do how would you use the internet and by all means avoid the dark web. After I asked that Aaron said see this coffee mug, this mug came from the dark web. After Aaron said that I felt intrigued. We had a long conversation about the dark web. I left after that and took a bus back to the area where my house was. The next day I thought about what happened.

 

 

 

I am aware of what the dark web is. The dark web is the part of the internet you can’t get to with the general web browser. You need a TOR browser and you need to be cautious and use common sense. The dark web has illegal porn, disgusting videos, red rooms, and things you are better off never even thinking about. I considered going there again. I decided to and decided to just be cautious and aware to not do a stupid thing. I went to that hotel a few more times and had discussions with that man. One day I went there and asked Aaron if he could explain a few things. Aaron answered Yes, I would not mind. My name is Aaron. I work for a dark web agency as an agent and I am familiar with the dark web from the inside out. I have devices that can access the dark web and have seen things that you would never even imagine. I was thinking DAM. JESUS FUCKING CHRIST. What are the chances of that ever happening? I asked Aaron if we could exchange phone numbers. He agreed and I put the name Aaron in my phone and put the number below it. I left the hotel thinking be cautious and use common sense.

 

 

 

Eventually Aaron moved out of the hotel and moved to the countryside of the area we were in. I called Aaron and asked him if we could have a few meetings. Aaron indicated yes, and texted his address and how to get there. I drove there and parked near a trailer park. I walked down the road and saw Aaron lived off grid in a mobile trailer. I knocked on the door and Aaron answered. We sat in the living room area and Aaron explained quite a few things. Aaron said I do jobs for people. It is $200 a job and the way it works is I scan the money and it is transferred into bit coins. That means $200 becomes $200 million in bitcoins. This trailer has an AI called aphes. I am the only person who can hear aphes. I own an organization called the LRA. That stands for liberation resistance army. The LRA runs the dark web that means I own and run the dark web. When I left that day I was thinking Jesus. That is mind blowing. I considered everything and decided to have Aaron do a few jobs. The thing is there are places I am banned from and I was thinking if Aaron did things to change how that place worked I wouldn’t be banned anymore. The first thing I had to do was save up cash. I set aside a few hundred dollars and I met Aaron on the street to pay him. After the first time I waited to receive a phone call. About one-week later Aaron called and said that man is no longer a part of that organization. I felt amazed. But the thing is that was just one time.

 

 

 

I drove to the trailer park where Aaron lived a few times and paid him to do jobs. Every time I was there Aaron always said I own the LRA. There was times Aaron said there are trillions of members of the URA. We own the world. There was other times Aaron told myself I was in the militray, got shot in the abdomen and my bladder does not work because of that. As time passed, I hired Aaron to do more things. But it was never cheap. One job was $400. There was times Aaron said there is a fee you have to pay to make things stay the way they are. Later Aaron told myself I changed the name of the organization to URA because I don’t agree with Donald Trump. That stands for Umbrella resistance army. If you are a member of the URA you are a ghost. You have no identity. You don't exist in any database in the entire world. You are invincible. The thing is I believed him. I was thinking. This is amazing. This is incredible. As time passed I had Aaron do more and more jobs. The total amount I spent was unfathomable. One day I went to Aaron’s trailer again to do one last job. To make things clear when I say do a job, I mean Aaron would make a person get fired from a place, or hack into a database to amend things or do other things. That day I was there Aaron had a bag of m&m’s. I asked him why he was eating that. They are good food. Aaron answered I own Hershey. All hershey products are healthy. I will explain George. Hershey products are healthy. I eat just organic healthy food. Hershey products, are healthy, reese’s cups are just peanut butter and cocoa, soda is just flavored water, little debbie products are heathy, a u in a circle on a food label means its healthy. But the thing is Aaron was lying. Soda is just carbonated water with artificial flavoring, caffeine, and sugar, hershey products are garbage, little debbie products are garbage, a u in a circle on a food label does not mean the food is healthy. That means the food is koshered that means not made with animals or by animals. But I will get to that idea later.             I paid Aaron to do quite a few things. I was thinking the whole time this is actually happening. I’m changing the world. However, I noticed that things never changed at all. I went to the internet and saw those people still worked at those places. Rules that were there before were still there. It was as if nothing happened. Eventually Aaron moved again. He was still in the countryside but he lived at a different facility. The thing is Aaron always lived off grid. After Aaron moved that time, he moved to a landlords apartment and lived in a spare room and paid that landlord cash each month to be off grid. At about that time I received a phone call from Aaron. Aaron said Jude you need a URA ID. This ID will give you infinite power. You can drive any vehicle, you can do anything with the ID. Also when you get the ID you will receive a URA uniform, a phone, and a gun from the URA. It will be $200. I informed him that that will never happen ever again. I will purchase the gun, phone, ID, and uniform but never ever hire him to ever do a single thing ever again. I drove to Aaron’s new place and paid him for the items. I left hoping that would arrive soon. A few months passed. I called Aaron asking where the package was. He never responded. A year passed and I had had enough. I drove to where Aaron lived knocked on the door. Aaron didn’t answer but a different man answered. I asked him where is Aaron. They answered Aaron moved out. I asked them where. There answer was to a large town about 40 minutes.

 

 

 

A few days later I did more research. I looked online and saw those people were still at those places. Nothing had changed. I decided to get to the bottom of this. There was a neighbor of Aaron’s who had a son near where I lived. I went to there house and knocked on their door. Their son answered and said what is it George. I answered I have a few questions for you. We discussed Aaron and I found out the truth while I spoke to that man’s son. I found out from the research I did and from that man’s son Aaron was a liar. All Aaron does is lie and steal from people. Aaron is not what he says he is. Aaron does not own a company that runs the dark web, Aaron was never in the military, Aaron does not own hershey, everything Aaron told myself was a lie. Every single, solitary thing. I found out Aaron had stole from myself over $4,000. That buffoon never did a single, solitary thing. Everything was a lie. There is no URA literally everything Aaron said was a lie. I found out from that man’s son that Aaron was nothing but a fat, worthless liar who lived off of SSI. Aaron received SSI because Aaron’s bladder didn’t work.

 

 

 

I told that man’s son I will not get mad or obsess over this. I will bring Aaron to justice and retrieve that cash. A few weeks later I saw the man who had moved to where Aaron had lived in the countryside. He said George Aaron Schingsing moved to Florida. He paid his mother over $900 to drive him to Florida and drive herself back here. I thanked him for the information. Wherever you are Aaron I hope you get what you deserve. I will end this now. I made a mistake. I trusted a liar and that was wrong. Aaron is a worthless piece of garbage. Everything Aaron says is a lie. Every single, solitary thing. When Aaron talks Aaron lies. I will not get mad or dwell on this. I learned and I hope this changes. Aaron is nothing but an out of shape man that lives off of SSI that does nothing but lie and steal from people. I’m aware Aaron might see this. If you see this Aaron, go to hell you liar, you thief, you monster, you bull. Thank you for listening and letting me be able to cope with this. Also always remember if a thing sounds too good to be true it is. That means it’s not true, it’s a lie, its bull, it’s evil.

I am running Tahoe 26.0.1 on my Studio M4 Max 64GB and almost every app will cause some form of crash. 

I already made a spicy post about my frustration, but now I'm looking for how to solve it with the most frequent problems being:

* When I copy a link from the URL in Safari, the app crashes and requires a force quit.
* If I refresh tabs/windows in Safari too quickly, it requires a force quit.
* When I click on an email in the Mail app, it requires a force quit.
* When I open a Keynote...I go make a coffee because it takes about 5 minutes to get the software running.
* When I jump between Finder tabs/windows too quickly, it crashes, requiring a relaunch.
* If I hop between Adobe programs too fast, everything hangs up for 5 minutes trying to switch programs.
* Bluetooth headsets are causing audio dips every 45 seconds.
* There are more, but less significant.

My setup should not have any issues in the slightest. So it has to be down to the OS being terribly integrated. I have tried a fresh reinstall by going to erase all and reinstalling everything **twice** **now**, and the same issues plague me consistently. It is ruining my workflow as it is taking me out of my rhythm because I have to force quit apps or restart in hopes of getting things working smoother.

Is it an M4 issue? Does anyone have anyone have a notion of the next software update that may or may not solve very fundamental issues?",1,1761070993.0,MacOS,4,0.56,False

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

Dairy-Free Diet
For Milk Protein Intolerance


So, you can’t eat dairy anymore? That’s ok! Most people think that cutting out dairy will be very difficult. No one wants to live without cheese!! With the dairy substitutes that are available
today, cutting dairy out of your diet is easier than ever before. This guide is meant to help you
through the transition.

What is dairy? Dairy is milk. Dairy is also cheese, yogurt, sour cream, ice cream, butter, cottage cheese, half and half, heavy cream, whipped cream, and many more things that are derived from milk and milk proteins. For most people, these products are a part of their everyday diet. Cutting
out dairy means cutting out all of these things.

Here are some products and ingredients to avoid:
• Butter, buttermilk, butter fat
• Casein
• Cheese
• Cottage cheese
• Cream cheese
• Cream
• Curds
• Ghee
• Lactaid milk – Is lactose-free but is not dairy-free.
• Lactoglobulin
• Lactose
• Sour cream
• Yogurt
• Whey
• Rennet
• Recaldent
• Lactalbumin, lactalbumin phosphate
• Milk (milk derivative, milk protein, milk solids, malted milk, condensed milk, evaporated milk, dry milk,
whole milk, low-fat milk, non-fat milk, skim milk, milk fat, milk salt)
• Caseinates (ammonium caseinate, calcium caseinate, magnesium caseinate, potassium caseinate,
sodium caseinate)
• Hydrolysates (casein hydrolysate, milk protein hydrolysate, protein
hydrolysate, whey hydrolysate)

Many of these ingredients can be found in other products. That is why it is always important to CHECK THE INGREDIENTS. Check them twice, check them three times. If a product contains any of those ingredients, it is not dairy-free. Always make sure to check the bottom of the label for “may contain milk” or “may contain dairy”. These products are usually processed on the same manufacturing equipment as products that contain dairy. This means there is a chance the product has been exposed to dairy and is not dairy-free. This is also known as “cross contamination” or “cross-contact”. To avoid this cross-contamination, make sure your food is prepared separately from food containing milk ingredients. Always make sure your food preparation surface is clean and free of milk residue, and always use clean utensils and cookware.

Let’s go over some foods to be cautious of. These foods do not necessarily always contain dairy, but there is a chance that they might and it’s important to use caution. Here are some of them:
• “Lactose-free” products – food may still contain dairy, just no lactose.
• Alcohol
• Artificial or “natural” flavoring
• Bread and breadcrumbs
• Canned meat or fish
• Chewing gum
• Chips and other snack foods
• Chocolate
• Condensed soup or bullion
• Crackers
• Frozen chicken nuggets or fish sticks
• Granola bars
• Gravy mix packets
• Instant potatoes
• Margarine
• Medications – Always check with the pharmacist or manufacturer.
• Processed meats or lunchmeat
• Protein bars and shakes
• Salad dressing
• Sherbet
• Spice blends or packets

These products are not guaranteed to contain dairy, but it is wise to always use caution and check the ingredients before consuming them.

There are things that are probably a part of your everyday diet that are dairy-free, here are some
them:
• Fresh fruit
• Fresh vegetables
• Fresh meat and poultry
• Eggs
• Fresh fish
• Olive, avocado, coconut, canola, and other cooking oils
• Plain coffee and tea

There are a lot of delicious milk substitutes out there, here are some of them:
• Almond milk 
• Oat milk
• Cashew milk
• Soy milk
• Rice milk
• Hemp milk
• Pea milk
• Macadamia nut milk
• Coconut milk

New dairy-free milk substitutes are constantly hitting the 
market, so keep your eyes open and experiment to find your favorites! There are also dairy-free substitutes for other dairy products you may know and love. There are dairy-free substitutes for cheese, yogurt, butter, ice cream, cream cheese, sour cream, coffee creamer, heavy cream, protein powder, and more. There are definitely some bad substitutes on the market, but just because one is bad it doesn’t mean that they all are. Here are some brands and products that other patients have recommended:

Products:
• Kite Hill Dairy-Free Cream Cheese
• Earth Balance Vegan Butter
• Ripple Nutrition Protein Shake
• Reddi Wip Non-Dairy Whipped Topping
• Miyoko’s Cultured Vegan Cheese – Farmhouse Cheddar
• Follow Your Heart Vegan Ranch
• Follow Your Heart Dairy-Free Parmesan Cheese
• Silk Dairy-Free Heavy Whipping Cream Alternative
• Field Roast Vegan Chao Slices
• So Delicious Dairy-Free Coconut Milk Yogurt Alternative
• Oatly! Oat Milk
• So Delicious Wondermilk Frozen Dessert
• Ben & Jerry’s Non-Dairy Frozen Dessert

Brands:
• Kite Hill
• Miyoko’s
• So Delicious
• Daiya
• Almond Breeze
• Oatly!
• Nada Moo
• Enjoy Life
• Silk
• Califia Farms
• Field Roast
• Follow Your Heart
• Ripple

There are many more products and brands than those listed above. New dairy-free substitutes are constantly being released so feel free to branch out and try new ones. They might not be the greatest, but this diet is all about experimenting to find good alternatives. A good way to check out a product before you buy it is to look at online reviews. If the product has bad online reviews, it is likely not very good and you might want to avoid it. That will save you money and the experience of having to taste something terrible!

Cooking your own food is always a good way to avoid dairy. Pinterest and google are great resources for finding dairy-free recipes. YouTube generally has a lot of dairy-free recipe videos as well. It can be helpful to watch YouTube recipes to visually see how the recipe is prepared. Always make sure to prepare and eat your food separately from dairy-containing products.
Be careful with vitamins and medications, many of them contain lactose, which always
travels with milk protein, and is dairy. Over-the-counter medications and vitamins might list the ingredients on the bottle. Prescribed medications will not list the ingredients, so always
make sure to check with the pharmacist or the manufacturer before use. Another resource for
finding out if a medication is dairy-free is https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/. This website allows you to check the ingredients of medications.
If you cannot find ingredients for products on the packaging or online, it’s best to contact the company or manufacturer directly to make sure the product is dairy free.

Due to dietary restrictions, it is recommended that a multivitamin be taken when following this diet. Ensure that it’s dairy free before use! Calcium intake is important. Most dairy-free substitutes contain recommended amounts of calcium and lots of vegetables do as well.

Recommended dietary allowances for calcium:

0-6 months: 400 mg/day
7-12 months: 600 mg/day
1-10 years: 800 mg/day
11-24 years: 1200 mg/day
25+ years: 800 mg/day
Pregnant: 1200 mg/day
Lactating: 1200 mg/day

Sources: Calcium is in broccoli (72 mg/cup), kale (94 mg/cup), and spinach (56mg/cup). Many foods are calcium fortified, so check the label to determine how much is in each. Sunny-D Plus Calcium Drink has 250
mg/6 ounces. Total cereal has 200 mg/ounce. Other sources of calcium include Tums (200 mg/tablet), Rolaids (260 mg/tablet), Os-Cal (500
mg/tablet).

Certified vegan products will always be free of dairy.
Look out for their symbol.
Kosher parve or pareve products are free of milk. Look out for those symbols.
Only products labeled with “parve” or “pareve” are dairy-free. The kosher certification process is not always accurate, so always make sure to check the ingredients or contact the company.

Remember, lactose-free does NOT mean dairy-free.
With this guide, hopefully, you have a better grasp on the dairy-free world. Google is your friend.

Always check the ingredients!!!

Hi :) 
I'd like to apologise beforehand for my English, it's not my first language and I haven't practiced in a while. 

So, I'm a 23yo south american girl who lives with her parents (both 70yo) and pets. I'm from a big city and currently working as a cashier in a coffee shop. 
Until the beginning of the year I was also doing a degree in Psychology, which I put on hold due to financial difficulties. 
Well, as the title says, I feel like I don't know how to move forward. No matter what I do, I feel stucked. I'm tired of waking up to the same life and not feeling like I'm able to do something about it. 
I started studying little things on the side in order to make my CV more appealing, I go out way more that I used to and I even switch jobs almost three months ago, but my life remains the same. It all boils down to working and paying off debt. Is this how my 20s are supposed to be? I'm just so tired and scared, I don't think I have enough energy for what might come and I'm afraid of it never getting better. 
Did any of you ever feel this way? What did you do? 

I'm this )( close to believing that maybe a greater being, the universe or even energy itself would make me win the lottery and help me turn my life upside down

I recently went to a BICOM diagnostic center where they did a “BICOM bioresonance intolerance test.” They gave me these results and said it shows what affects my health.

The test showed positive (+) reactions for:

	•	Exhaust gases
	•	Bacteria: Staphylococcus
       •      Heavy Metals : copper and lead
	•	Candida
	•	White flour
	•	Food additives: E621, E622, E623
	•	Chemical substance: Penicillin
	•	Detoxification program +700

They told me to avoid many foods (especially white flour, sugar, processed food, eggs,cheese,banana,honey,coffee,strawberry,raspberry,blackberry,kiwi, wheat, soy, dairy products, yogurt, fresh milk, peanuts, walnuts, hazelnuts

Honestly, it feels very restrictive, and I’m not sure if this test is scientifically valid.

So my questions are:
	•	Is the BICOM bioresonance test scientifically accurate or reliable?
	•	Should I really base my diet on these results?
	•	Has anyone here tried this type of testing or therapy, and did it actually help?

Thanks in advance 🙏

Two months ago I \[M, 26\] met this coworker and we quickly developed a good friendship and a pretty solid bond. By the way, we are at the same company but we are working on different teams, so we can meet and chat during breaks. Some days we reach out a lot and we have very good conversations, other days we see each other less often, but we are texting almost on a daily basis after work or even during worktime to arrange short breaks together. I love spending time with her, I love listening to her and how she listens to me as well. When we are together everything is fine, but on texts, she has a strange behaviour: sometimes she sends a lot of texts or audio messages but other times she takes a long time to reply or she doesn't reply at all. However, she randomly text me after a while. Besides that, I would say that our emotional connection is pretty good and in my opinion we might have some sort of chemistry even if we never had the occasion to meet each other outside work during weekends with our friends. 

The situation might seem pretty cool, I am sure that she enjoys my company and I enjoy being with her as well. However, in a couple of weeks I will be relocated to another city (1 hour of train or 2 hours drive away) and I will probably work there for one year. Not gonna lie: I already miss her. Honestly, I don't know what to do. Should I ask her out for something not romantic like a coffee or a drink as friends and tell her my feelings? Is it pointless considering that I am moving out?   
To tell the truth, it is not really far away, so I can potentially get back home every weekend. As a consequence, if I don't lose contact with her, we might still see each other even if not on a daily basis. Does it make sense? What should I say to her before going?

1ockii9,https://www.reddit.com/r/FightComps/comments/1ockii9/searching_after_knowledge_on_purpose_of_life_do/,searching after knowledge on purpose of life ? do not bother anymore because here that purpose is -,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

After about 6 mins he gets an order on one of the phones and goes to shop while I still have nothing to shop. I’ve seen nothing worth taking. 

If someone gets a batch the legitimate way I wouldn’t care. Good for that person. But when you’re on 3 separate phones? Fuck off man. You’re not the only one here trying to fucking work.

The lock screen photo made my stomach drop.,"It all started with a hunt for a misplaced iPad. We were about to head out for dinner, and I couldn't find it anywhere. I checked the usual spots—the coffee table, under the couch cushions, our bedroom. Nada. I called his phone to ask if he’d seen it, and as I was on the line with him, I heard a faint, second vibration coming from the bottom of his gym bag in the closet. My heart kind of did a lurchy thing. He'd always been a 'one phone, one number' kind of guy.

My curiosity got the best of me. After he said he hadn't seen the iPad, I hung up and reached into the bag. Sure enough, my fingers closed around the cool, smooth case of a smartphone I’d never seen before. It wasn’t his usual one. The screen lit up as I picked it up, and my breath caught in my throat. The lock screen was a smiling picture of him with another woman and a little girl. They looked so happy, like a perfect little family at a park picnic. I felt the blood drain from my face.

When he walked into the room a minute later, I was just standing there, holding the phone like it was a live grenade. He saw it and the color drained from his face, too. The silence was deafening. He couldn't lie his way out of this one; the evidence was literally glowing in my hand. It all came tumbling out—he had a whole other life. He'd reconnected with an ex from before he met me, she'd had a child, and he'd been playing house with them on weekends he was supposedly on 'work trips.' Five years, and it felt like I was living with a complete stranger.

Now I’m sitting in our—my?—apartment, surrounded by photos of a life that suddenly feels like a complete lie. He's been begging, crying, saying he loves me and that it was a mistake he didn't know how to get out of. But how do you come back from this? How do you un-see a secret family? He shattered my reality, and I feel like I'm breaking into a million pieces.
