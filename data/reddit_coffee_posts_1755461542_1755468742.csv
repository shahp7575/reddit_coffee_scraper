1mt46ry,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1mt46ry/i_need_some_serious_help/,I need some serious help,"I just graduated high school at 18 and I’ve been searching for jobs for the past 6 months. 

I’m not exaggerating when i say I’ve applied literally EVERYWHERE. No matter what i do, every single one of my applications just gets ghosted. I even got ghosted by McDonalds. I’ve submitted over 35 online applications THIS MONTH and have only gotten 2 rejections. The only place i know i cant work at is a cafe because i have a serious coffee aversion, but other than that I’ve submitted an application to every grocery store, fast food chain, retail store, etc.

Ive even talked to my university and i cant get a job there on campus because i don’t qualify for federal work studies (i live in cali), and I’ve applied to every single opportunity at the career center there, and still nothing.

My mom keeps telling me to go down in person and submit an application, but every time I do, i just get told to apply online. 

I’m genuinely losing all hope and i could use some advice on what to do",1,1755468530.0,jobs,0,1.0,False
1mt46pd,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1mt46pd/i_had_a_horrible_demanding_boss_from_my_first/,I had a horrible demanding boss from my first office job so I would do things to get revenge on him without him knowing it,"I worked at an advertising agency 32 years ago. We had a creative director who was incredibly unreasonable, demanding and rude. He would often ask me to do personal errands for him that were not part of my job. He definitely looked down on me.

I was the receptionist and I got half an hour for lunch. In order to take lunch I had to have somebody watch the phone for me. When he would see me leave for lunch he would demand that I order and pick up his lunch on my lunch hour and bring it to him. This would leave me 10 minutes for my own lunch.

He ordered the same thing every time. Grilled cheese with mayonnaise, extra crispy. I started ordering his sandwich wrong. Every time. When he mentioned it was wrong I would say, sorry the restaurant is really busy. They must’ve made a mistake.

He would have me make him coffee and bring it to him. Meanwhile, I had to watch a 10 line switchboard that rang constantly. His coffee was supposed to be black with no sugar. I would often bring it to him in a dirty cup with 3 teaspoons of sugar in it. 

He also asked me to do personal mail outs for him as we had a mail machine that had stamps in it. Things like Christmas and birthday cards and also invitations to parties. One time he gave me several things to send out, and they fell behind our mail machine without me realizing. About a month later, he came to me and said, no one received the cards you sent them. I told him I didn’t know because I had mailed them. There was no way of tracking them. Later, I was cleaning behind the mail machine and found them all. I put them in my purse and went for a long walk after work and threw them deep inside a garbage can. 

Eventually, he stopped, asking me to do personal things for him! I’m sure he thought I was an idiot, but he could not complain because I wasn’t supposed to be doing those things in the first place!

1mt464n,https://www.reddit.com/r/KidneyStones/comments/1mt464n/how_long_can_a_5mm_stone_take_to_pass/,How long can a 5mm stone take to pass ?,"I posted a few days ago wondering how I would be able to deal with the pain without narcotics, turns out I just couldn't.
On the day after I was rushed to the ER with the most painful renal colic in my life, the scan showed that I have a 5mm stone in the distal part of my right ureter.

After the morphine IV did its thing  I was discharged with a prescription for narcotics and flomax and told that the stone would most lilely pass within the next few days, I was instructed to take the medication and urinate in coffee filters to catch the stone and have it analysed before making an appointment with the urologist.
As the stone is small enough to pass, I was told to only go back to the ER of I had a fever or visible hematuria, I have had four more episodes of renal colic since then the longest of which lasted for four hellish hours despite the painkillers.
I feel scared as I've read online that I might be in for a few more weeks of pain before the stone passes due to its size.

I'm stressed, exhausted, discouraged and in between  moments of pain I dread the next attack. To make matters worse I haven't been able to eat normal amounts due to steess and nausea which is concerning because I'm already a bit underweight to begin with.

If you already had a stone this size how long did it take to pass ? I just want to know that this nightmare will end soon.

1mt45kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITH/comments/1mt45kj/raitah_am_i_the_ass_hole_for_breaking_up_with_my/,R/AITAH Am I the ass hole for breaking up with my boyfriend after he accused me of ruining his entire life for the umpteenth time Advice Needed,"TL;DR: Boyfriend and I were in a long-distance relationship, I got diagnosed with a potentially cancerous tumor, he quit his job to care for me, and now he's blaming me for his financial struggles and job loss after I broke up with him. I (19F) met my boyfriend (24M) online,we both are indians and we were in a long-distance relationship. We wanted to settle in Europe so first he moved to in Slovenia after getting a job and after 1½ years later i moved to in Germany for my ausbildung. At my first week in germany, I got diagnosed with a tumor in my hand that could possibly be cancerous. I immediately wanted to break up with him because I didn't want him to feel burdened by my health issues. However, he refused to break up with me and said he wanted to support me(which now he claims is because he thought it was a joke). So as he showed me support and after promissing me he will be there in every step of this journey with me. I asked him if he can come to germany to support me but I didn't forced him he could just say no if didn't wanted to . I might have pushed him a bit to come fast as he can as he promised and said he wanted me in his life and Will always be there. He came to Germany to care for me. I was touched by his gesture, but I felt guilty knowing that he was sacrificing a lot for me.Things have gotten even more complicated. He has some drinking issues, and few times at nights when he was super drunk, he tried to leave Germany and drive back to Slovenia. I stopped him because I was worried about his safety and didn't want him to have an accident. I have cut my wrist due to all the pressure and to stop him going like that after a stupid fight in that much drunk state. This has also lead to something even bad as he started to smoke cigarettes and also blamed on me as if me cutting my wrist have give him so much stress and this is why he is currently smoking and he continued smoking all the way to a new addiction even smoked in our room when I have severe nausea due to chemo. He promised means to quit smoking once he get to Slovenia. And I like to believe it. Now, he's blaming me for stopping him and says I shouldn't have cared if he died. He claims I've betrayed him and his family.he had also hit me during this time and fought a lot with me when he was drunk But I forgave it because he was only like this when he drank and the other moments with him was loving and he cared for me like so much even bathed me fed me and hugged me to sleep Fast forward to when I had to go back to India to continue my treatment as i couldn't bare it alone there with the chemo i needed my parents. He lost his current job and luckily got a new job offer in Germany, and he had to come back to Slovenia to finalize some paperwork when. I thought everything was okay, but after a few months after us trying every he could not get that job he got his visa annuled and came back to India but now he has another job offer in Slovenia but now he's blaming me for ruining his life. He's saying that i have ruined his career and caused him debt. I should have gone back to India immediately without waiting for biopsy results. I'm feeling really guilty and conflicted about the whole situation. I asked him to come to Germany because I needed his support, but I feel like he could have said no. He made those decisions on his own. He's even bringing my dad into our conversations and talking bad about him. I'm at a loss for what to do. Update: Should I finalize the breakup? Despite everything, I still have feelings for him, and I appreciate the help he provided when I was alone in Germany during a really tough time. However, his current behavior is causing me a lot of stress, and I'm not sure if I can handle being in a relationship with someone who blames me like this, especially given his drinking issues. Update 2: i have completed my treatment and is trying to recover from the side effects i have tried to make things work a lot but feel like I should Stop this relationship because I don't want him to feel burdened by my health issues recently few other problems also rose as he wanted me to convert to Christianity which I have already told I won't at the beginning of the relationship and i have to move back to Germany or Slovenia which I don't think is good with my health issues. I have denied both and told I can't do this we should stop this and just be friends and I'll completely help him return to Slovenia like not financially but dealing with paper work and guidances. We tried it for few days like still kept calling eachother and slept talking at night and few days later patched up again. This happened few times but yesterday he got drunk again and had a fight with his dad and things escalated quickly physically. I was mad about it but haven't fought with him either lectured him until he repeatedly pushed me asking what happened that night then he told me he wanted to stop drinking plead help him i suggested that he see a doctor which he agreed to. Then at evening he pranked me saying he have been custodied by police and send me a video of him searching for something tensed without any explanation i got super worried and stressed and when I called him as usual to sleep he told me this whole thing was a prank. Then I told him I feel tensed and feel like going to hospital to check my pressure and can I go to my mom's room to sleep because it can call me down. But he reacted like then why did you call me I know you are like this you always wants to be sleep with your mom you don't care about me and all. Yes it's partially true because I'm not really comfortable to talk to him these days as I'm too stressed to deal with his drama. I have changed the topic to avoid an argument then he bought up something about a boy who was in same class as me in Germany. I told him I have a feeling he is gay as he acts like that he is like a girly girl with girls and kinda touchy with boys as I have once witnessed sitting on lap of another boy in our class then I added he used to sit next to me as our seating is arranged by the teacher and this boy have once drank my coffee and shared a sandwich to me this have angered him as I haven't told him this before as I never felt it important. And he added that he have also heard something bad about from a friend of mine. This is new news to me and it fired all my frustrations against him as I have never once doubted him or blamed him for something another person told me because trust is a big factor for me in a relationship. I exploded with rage pouring out my heart and real feelings about him and this whole situation. I have always let go of his but behaviour to me, all the cussing all the gaslighting and manipulations. He is even claiming that I am the cause of his drinking habit like my diagnosis gave him too much stress and that's why he is drinking. He also says casually that he is ""Cool Lip"" is a smokeless tobacco product that comes in small filter pouches containing tobacco leaves and flavorings like sandalwood oil, spices, and floral essences. It is designed to be placed between the lip and gum which I really am against and when he says so sometimes drunk other time sober and when I get angry or crying he says it's just a prank he haven't done it without any proof which really stressed the hell out of me. I have always stop the files as I thought one person and relationships should let go of the ego and stop the fight and I want a peace and not fighting or arguing. I said sorry even if it was his fault I begged him to stay. Even didn't forgave him for insulting my parents. Everything just because I loved him and what he did for me was huge. Put whenever a fight escalates he always bring up the fact that she have to care of me and he lost everything for me and kind of guilt tripped me. But I have finally came to my senses and stopped endorsing all this silently and have talked back and told him don't try to scare me this time as sometime she have kind of blackmailed me or me that he is going to call my dad and say pay me I took care of your daughter and to insult me but this time I have totally was done and told him to do whatever he wants and I want change my decision because it's really done if I don't know like you have told me this is also for him to but I don't know he will call me later tomorrow and ask me to stay or guilt trip me more Yes I admit that he does this even when he is sober as he always blamed me for every tiny mistakes that I  made carelessly when helping him draft me as his English is not that good and you also accused me of being the person who is making his job and or job opportunity like the chance for him to get the job difficult as I am the only one making mistakes yes I am the only one making the mistakes because I am the only one who is doing something he never does anything even if it's really easy teenager can do it like I have only the qualification of plus two and he is a diploma holder even when I am during chemo he insists that I fill this form I write the mail or stuff like that.
Edit: I'm still dealing with my health issues, and this situation is taking a toll on me. I'm looking for advice or stories from others who might have gone through something similar. How did you handle it? Should I prioritize my own well-being and end the relationship, or is there a way to work through this together?",1,1755468447.0,AITH,0,1.0,False

1mt43x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1mt43x4/my_body_tolerates_alcohol_far_better_than_soda/,"My body tolerates alcohol far better than soda, coffee or tea.","It kinda sucks that here in America as a Gen Z adult, and especially when talking to folks on social media or Reddit, alcohol is sometimes super demonized.  

Ever since I was 13, I always loved collecting and trying various different coffees and teas. This lasted well into adulthood, and even as a 22-23 year old I hardly ever drank booze but loved my coffee rituals. I still have a shitton of coffee beans and tea tins that I’ve never gotten to finish, as well as a full AeroPress setup and various French presses, etc… I even worked as a volunteer barista at my church growing up, and I worked as a barista for a full year 2019-2020. But as I got older and my dysautonomia worsened, it began to backfire on me. As the years went on I’d order half caffe more often or have smaller cups of coffee to ensure I could still try new tastes and blends. But by the time I was 23/24… it began to have disastrous effects on me. 

Now, any time that I have caffeine, I’m basically taking a dice roll on how badly my body will react to it. Dead serious here, I literally have to plan out ahead of time if I want to drink a can of soda and prep for it. I often have to take Levsin to make it possible, too. 

Caffeine for me, results in excruciating visceral abdominal pain and debilitating hyperadrenergic flares. Even freaking decaf is a dice roll on if I’ll tolerate it OK or not. 

So… I was quite miserable the first half of this year. I basically had to give up a favorite lifelong hobby/special interest for my health, because nearly every time I drank it I would be in horrible pain, laying in a hot bath or shower in the fetal position. It also caused me horribly embarrassing moments, like when I drank half a Coca Cola can at Easter dinner with family and ended up throwing up from sheer visceral pain and hyper vagal responses. 

But… I discovered something interesting. I can handle alcohol far, far better than I can any of those other substances. Since discovering this and making fine drinking a hobby, my quality of life has gone up measurably! Now I’m realizing so much cool stuff, I’m collecting rare or unique liquor bottles (particularly tequila/mezcal and whiskey). As long as I keep well hydrated during my drinking and I sip slowly and intentionally and savor the taste, and keep my drinking well within moderate bounds, my body doesn’t freak out like AT ALL. (obvious exceptions being hot or humid days). 

Anyways, yeah, it’s a super neat (pun intended) hobby I’ve developed now. But it always blows people’s minds when I say, “I had to quit coffee and start drinking alcohol instead to get my ‘Consumable Beverages With Origin/Region Stories and Tasting Notes’ fix.” And now I’ve had to let family know that I can’t really handle most coffees or teas anymore (well, I can handle herbal, but that still limits me to like 30% of the teas out there).

1mt41jt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1mt41jt/the_man_i_couldnt_escape/,The Man I Couldn’t Escape,"When I married Frankie, I thought I had found safety. He was magnetic, the kind of man who could pull you into his orbit with nothing more than a glance. But soon, I discovered that Frankie wasn’t just one man. He was many.

There was the soft Frankie, who whispered promises into my hair. The cold Frankie, who vanished into silence for days. And the dark Frankie, the one who slammed doors, broke dishes, and reminded me with clenched fists that love could be a weapon.

Living with him was like living in a haunted house. I never knew which spirit I’d wake up beside. Some nights, his voices overlapped, twisting into arguments I couldn’t follow, and I’d lie in bed staring at the ceiling, praying he wouldn’t drag me into them. My footsteps grew quieter, my words fewer. I became a shadow in my own home.

But shadows can learn to move unseen.

For months, I planned in silence, papers hidden at the back of a drawer, money tucked away in an old coffee can, a spare key copied when he wasn’t looking. I memorized the creaks of the floorboards so I could slip past them unnoticed. Every plan was a gamble, but I had one advantage: Frankie never noticed me unless he wanted to.

The night I left, the house trembled with his anger. He’d been drinking, switching from one version of himself to the next like a man possessed. I waited until his rage burned out, until his body slumped heavy on the couch. My hands shook as I grabbed the bag I’d hidden under the bed.

The front door felt like the final test. My heart pounded so loud I thought it would wake him. But the lock clicked open, and suddenly the night air hit me like a wave. I ran. Down the street, past the corner, until the house was nothing but a dark shape behind me.

By dawn, the divorce papers were signed and sealed. Frankie could keep his ghosts, I wasn’t one of them anymore.

I walked away bruised but breathing, terrified but free. And as the sun rose, I realized I had escaped not just a man, but an entire prison built of his fractured selves.

This was my beginning.

I am so proud of my fiancee. He has had six months of a hellish freak combination of major health issues hitting him back to back that have given him a life long disability and required a major life saving operation that he has had to endure intense rehab to be strong enough to qualify for. He's also had to learn to walk again, which he managed to pull off in slightly less than three months. I am so incredibly proud of him and excited to walk down the aisle with him when we are on the other side of all these hospital visits.

Throughout this hell of a fucking year his family have been mainly focused on how his mother feels about it rather than him. Both he and I agreed early on in our relationship to not wade into each others family issues and to trust each other to handle it. The deal is that I have my partners back and shield him from my mother's nonsense, and he does the same for me with his. I know what it is like to have a mother function like gravitational force that everyone else orbits around; that's why I pop my head in here every once in a while to restore my sense of sanity. The last thing I want to do is stir up extra shit for him to deal with, so I generally bite my tongue. But it has been *so difficult*, especially when I see how he is consistently disrespected and railroaded and how his siblings are such cowards about it. 

This latest hospital stay has been one that's close enough to his mother that she's been able to book cabs to come visit him, so every morning the pressure is on for him to plan her visit for the day. His sister calls only to make sure that he's taken care of it so their mom gets off her back, and any check in on how he's doing is just a pretense for getting information to feed to his mother. The one day he didn't handle managing his mother in time she showed up by pushing her way into the hospital room the minute visiting hours started and started calling all her friends to talk about him and trying to record clips of him to send to them. My partner told me to go for a walk when she arrived because we both knew I wouldnt be able to keep my poker face on. He lasted about half an hour before booking her a cab to leave. And then of course all the phone calls started about my ""attitude"", which both my partner and I anticipated and handled.

It finally came to a head this morning when he had a medical issue that flared up. He was in excruciating pain and had to be given extremely strong painkillers until the doctor on the ward could identify which nerve was affected and why, so I informed his sister and mother and niece about what was happening and that he couldnt have visitors until the doctors could figure out how to fix the nerve signal issue, but that he was safe and there was no risk that it was serious or life threatening, just extremely exhausting and painful. The pain was almost unbearable and went on for a full seven hours before they could identify the issue and resolve it, after which my partner immediately fell asleep from exhaustion. I then started to update his sister via text and she called me sobbing from having to deal with their mom all morning. She revealed to me that their mother has been relentlessly verbally and emotionally abusing her to the breaking point the entire time my partner and I have been in town. I had a long and gentle discussion with her about the cost of enabling narcissism and the type of abuse that oldest sisters often get saddled with in these types of situations, but I knew that this moment of clarity from his sister would be brief. 

What I didn't know was just *how* brief. When I returned to the hospital room my partner was awake and when I told him about the phone call with his sister he immediately called for the nursing staff to tell them that his mother was not to be let into the ward. He then called his sister to tell her what he's done and to tell her to stop answering calls from their mom today to take a break and she (of course) gets upset that he won't just see their mom for five minutes to appease her and calm the situation down.Ten minutes later a nurse tells us that his mother has thrown a fit at the entrance to the ward and is crying and won't leave. So he calls his mother to tell her that no, the hospital hasnt conspired against her, his partner isn't trying to get in the way, it is in fact her own precious baby son that doesn't want to see her today and that she has to respect that or fuck off (spoken in much more polite terms). She then (of course) starts screaming about her rights as a mother and her feelings... 

Y'all. This fucking day. My wonderful partner has been handling so much. I can't believe how stoic this man is. I don't understand how he can handle this shit on top of all the rest and remain so sweet and calm and grounded. After handling his mom he had a cup of coffee and then nonchalantly spent the rest of the the day working on his rehab and joking around with the nurses. I appreciate him and his beautiful gorgeous shiny backbone so much, but it honestly terrifies me how calm he is about it. I am still, hours later, vibrating from the tension of this day. If I was him I would be frothing at the mouth. If that was my mother I would have been seeing absolute red (though to be fair, my mother didn't like when I was sick and never visited me in the hospital, except for the time she broke my hand when I was 10 and spent the entire time at the ER in performative hysterics to avoid being blamed for it while I comforted her).

I am so so so so so fucking tired of moms. If I have to stay in this hospital and get an earful of ""you don't understand what it's like to be a mother"" or something about ""a mother's love"" one more fucking time from his sister, one of my sisters, his mother, my mother or a fucking nurse I'm going to scream. Fuck moms, fuck motherhood, fuck treating your kids like body parts. This isnt empathy, or caring or nurturing. If this fucking bullshit is a mother's love then I'm getting a hysterectomy.

I don't want to elope, but I don't know if I can handle a wedding with this shit. Maybe I can trap his mom and my mom in some kind of pit together and slip his sister a sedative. That's doable, right?",1,1755468005.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

The thing is: I haven’t spoken to her in all this time, and I don’t even know if she’s single right now. I’d like to give it a try, but I’m also worried I might come across as desperate or creepy, which I really don’t want.

1mt3ush,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lavalamps/comments/1mt3ush/the_frankenlamp/,The Frankenlamp,"My prior evening of lava lamps led me to a Sunday morning of scrolling the virtual local marketplace for more luminous movement... a dangerous position when you've just sold a piece of furniture. The cash was sitting on the coffee table. The scroll let me to a vintage yellow grande 45 minutes north of me for $120. He agreed to $100. Off I went to retrieve my second grande- the very first I've invested in with my own adult money (my original came out of my childhood garage, who knows whose it was but it sat for more than a decade at least and it stowed away when I moved out, never to be mentioned again but enjoyed almost daily after its 7 day wax warming and flows like a charm).  
  
The lamp is hurriedly handed to my boyfriend by a young dude who pulled up in a lincoln or something with some ladies in the back- I handed him a crisp hundo- and my boyfriend placed it in front of me in the passenger seat. The seller scurried off after telling me if I have any of these already in a similar condition he'd buy it for like half of what I paid- so let him know, because he restores them!  
  
Upon investigation I was met with what I am calling ""The Frankenlamp"". A cap both too large and too short, a haze in the clear liquid that formerly photographed like it was invisible, per the listing. Sticky (and crusty?) glue all over the cap that is now on my floormats after the jingle from the drive drove its immediate banishment to a softer surface. Then... the cause of the glue!! It hits me as I try to remove the globe from the base- and am unable! Like the sword in the stone, my boyfriend steps back around the vehicle to try from a better point of leverage after my gasp at the possibility. Maybe it just hasn't been used in too long, the humidity made it a little sticky, who knows?! Glue was swiftly confirmed. Is this base from a third lamp? Does restoration generally include rendering the lamp useless once this bulb dies out? Is this bulb even alive? IS THERE EVEN A BULB IN THE LAMP?! Does the plug even work? If theres a bulb, is it the right bulb?! Well. We'll have to see when we get home. In the meantime, I present to you, the lamp I've rescued from the bedroom of Sid himself (toy story), without further ado, the:

p.s. before anyone has a reaction outside the scope of the purpose of this story: this is my genuine reaction as I ride home with this silly yellow benjamin that became mine totally at fault of my own jump to giddy pickup energy rather than question the seller; lesson learned and hopefully not repeated (the lamps meant for me will come to me without struggle) and felt it would be a funny one to share, with an underlying PSA/reminder for all of us who share in the love of the lamps that I honestly needed myself.  
  
Any guidance on what the Frankenlamp is/was/how it could be made safe and more solid (maybe full revamp?). I have now made it home and when plugged in, it turns on so letting it settle from travel and then will try to run it way later maybe? ",1,1755467733.0,Lavalamps,2,1.0,False

1mt3r3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mt3r3s/i_found_an_extra_light_switch_in_my_apartment_and/,I found an extra light switch in my apartment and it ruined my life,"It’s been about seven months since I signed my year long lease for this shithole apartment. I don’t think I’ll be making it another five months. I’m not sure if I’ll even make it another night. My cheapness might’ve cost me my life. 

I was going to make this a short cry for help before I remembered that no one would ever believe me and it would be too late anyway. Hell, I wouldn’t believe this if I stumbled across it. I’ll just take my time here and pour my heart out. 

Seven months ago, I made what I now realise was the worst decision of my life. I moved into this dumpy ass apartment building after finally making the move out of my hometown. I had romanticized the idea of escapism so much. I pictured myself in New York City or something like that, walking down the sidewalk with some overpriced coffee in my hands and my tasteful messenger bag slung around my shoulder. I’d be walking to somewhere idyllic, maybe a get-together with new friends that took an interest in me or something like that - I never made it too far into that daydream. I just wanted to get out of that little rural town. It was one of those towns that was just a road with a bunch of sad old signs along it. Blown out buildings with occasional passing silhouettes that were once somebodies.

Let’s just say I couldn’t afford New York City, but I could afford a small city a few hours from that rotting place of a town. It’s a city with some high rises and skyscrapers but nothing that’s going to put it on somebody's road trip. It’s a pretty lonely place, honestly. It’s old and tired like my hometown, but in a more industrial way. Walkability isn’t much of a reality here unless you want to take your chances with the harsh weather or the rampant mugging - so there went my sidewalk daydream.

Still, I wanted to make the most of the experience. I got an apartment right downtown for a reasonable price and figured life would improve from there on. However, I failed to truly grasp how much of a piece of shit the apartment was until I moved in. I was a little too naive at the time to understand the spectrum of stress caused by a “landlord special”. The door knobs would come right off, the fridge never fully shut, the toilet wouldn’t flush without some sacred jiggling sequence, and a whole mess of other inconveniences or hazards. 

This apartment also has a lot of strange features. The floor plan doesn’t make much sense and anyone with a shred of interior design knowledge or even just self respect would’ve immediately crossed this place off their list. I was so desperate though that I didn’t mind when I entered the apartment and just saw a hallway full of closed doors. I shrugged off how strange it was that each room was contained behind one of those doors, with none of the rooms connecting to one another. The kitchen is its own closed off room, the living room too - the only way to get anywhere in the apartment was to take the central hallway. It honestly looks like one of those hallway chase shots in Scooby Doo or some shit.

For how awful the place is, it’s not small. There are a good amount of rooms, and I actually hadn’t  been able to fill one particular room until recently.

When you walk into the place, there’s the long hallway and then nine doors total. There’s four on the left side, four on the right, and one at the very end of the hallway. On the right side, the doors in order are the living room, a closet, then my bedroom, and then the bathroom. On the left side it starts with the kitchen, then another closet, the dining room, and a second bedroom. The ninth door in the middle is that extra room. I barely had enough stuff just to fill the other rooms and I lacked any sort of motivation to do anything with the extra room for a while. I have a corner unit so all the rooms on the right side of the apartment have windows as well as the extra room. The extra room has these neat casement windows that I like to look out of but offer little privacy. I had thought to make the extra room a sort of reading area or a home theater type deal but I was flat broke.

The extra room is strange. It’s really big and open. It feels like an apartment of its own. One night, I was in there just looking out at the other surrounding high rises when I noticed a light switch that had been painted over right next to the window. I didn’t think much of it. It was clearly just another amenity of my shithole apartment. I left it alone.

As time went on, I found myself in that extra room most nights just looking out the window. I didn’t have the money for any fancy streaming services nor friends to leech off of - so I just looked out that window most nights. It was peaceful and at night the city looked bigger and more lively. I loved seeing all the different lights, the blurry shapes of people in their own world watching their TV or making dinner. It didn’t take long for me to start picking at the paint on that hidden light switch as I watched the world wind down every night.

I’d chip away at the paint little by little with my finger while I was lost in my thoughts. It took a few days to make any sort of progress, but eventually I had peeled off enough paint to see the light switch. It was a different color than the new plain white paint that covered everything else. It was bronze and the switch itself was almost antique looking. It got me wondering how old this building was.

A few nights later the old switch was finally uncovered. It caught the light in an intoxicating way and I flipped the switch on and off a few times to see if it still worked and what it controlled. Nothing changed. 

The next night brought a heavy snowstorm. It was beautiful and you already know I was set up at that window staring out at the world as the brilliant snow fell. At some point, I was reminded of the bronze light switch and I flicked it, not remembering if I’d already tried it the night before. Nothing changed. I absentmindedly flicked it again and noticed something strange out of the corner of my eye. A light turned on in the building across the street. 

It was the rightmost room on the top floor of the neighboring high rise which was quite a bit taller than my building. At first, I just thought it was something new to look at. My hand still on the switch, I craned my neck up and leaned in to watch the new light. I lost concentration and flicked the switch down and the room’s light turned off. That caught my attention. I looked down at the switch and back up at the now dark pane of glass. I flipped the switch up and at that exact moment the room’s light turned back on. 

I continued doing this for probably five minutes - just flipping the switch on and off and watching as the faraway room’s light perfectly matched. The snow began falling even more, but I could still make out the light turning off and on with every flick of the old switch. I was baffled before too long. So baffled that I went right to sleep, convinced I was deprived of logic and reasoning.

The next night came and, at first, I was definitely reluctant to mess with that switch or to even go in that room. I tried staring out other windows but they were cloudy with trapped moisture. I remember thinking I should get a cat or something before I finally caved and walked into the extra room.

There was traffic on the street below from some accident that night and it provided me with enough entertainment to remain distracted from what happened the night before. The standstill row of gray cars could only stimulate me for so long before I was looking at that switch again. 

I flipped it.

Such a harmless action, and so quick too. Flipping a light switch. Usually done by second nature. What’s the harm in it? Why did flipping that switch feel so important? 

The same room from the night before lit up. It was a yellow, more vintage looking tone of light. I tried using some beaten up binoculars from my childhood but all I got was a somehow-fuzzier view of the room. From my vantage, I could only really see the ceiling of that mysterious place.

*That’s gotta be an apartment, right? It looks too big to be a storage closet. Too small to be anything commercial.*

I flipped the switch again and the light turned off in perfect succession.

*Is somebody fucking with me?*

Flip. The light came back on.

*How would they even orchestrate that?*

I sat there for a long time, repeatedly flipping the switch on and off as if the repetition of this would bring more clarity. I stood there flipping that switch on and off like I was a geriatric old man smacking a television set, hoping for a signal.

The traffic jam cleared out and the streets became empty. I sat there, still as I could be, periodically flipping the switch on and off. The light synced every single time. 

Clearly this light switch - for some reason - was wired to that room in the building across the street. As to why, I had no earthly idea.

*What an expensive project, and for what? What purpose does it serve?*

I flipped the switch up and the light came back on. That last flip of the switch activated a - sorry - lightbulb moment within me. 

*What if I found a way into that room?* 

So I waited in the bitter cold, rehearsing my moves. I had counted up from the ground and determined the room which connected to my light switch was on the 31st floor and again it was the corner unit on the right side of the building when viewing from my apartment.

I waited for someone to go in or out of the building. Finally, I saw a woman with a giant coat drag her scrappy little dog towards the door. I was hesitant to actually go inside, but then I gathered some courage, walked right up to that door and casually slid through as she opened it. I had planned some elaborate cover story that my friend wouldn’t answer his phone and all that, but when it came time, I just acted natural and thanked her as I entered.

The halls were green and sickly looking, much like my apartment building. The elevator was questionable at best and creaked a little too much as I stepped into it. There were 33 floors so I was glad I had made note of the correct one. I slowly reached up and hit the circular button for the 31st floor and it flickered on, glowing with a jaundiced yellow.

My hands grew clammy as the elevator ascended at a torturously slow pace. I watched the numbers rise…

11… 12… 13…

*This is a stupid idea, man.*

*This is all in my head.*

*Why am I doing this?*

26… 27… 28…

*Is this even legal?*

*What am I going to do, exactly?*

The elevator finally dinged and bounced to a stop on the 31st floor before I had an actual plan. The doors were reluctant to open, and for a moment, my heart sank thinking I had been trapped in there. 

Those silver doors creaked and warped as they moved out of the way and exposed me to another green hallway. I stepped out and turned left. I could see all the way down the long dilapidated hall, the green lights humming and buzzing. My alleged culprit was the final door on the right.

It was room 3118. I sat outside the door like a maniac, just looking at it. I wondered what to do. I could barely see through the slits on the sides of the door, all I could make out was that the lights were on in there. 

*Do I knock?*

I looked around me and made sure the coast was clear.

*What the hell do I say? Maybe I’m lost? Maybe it’s an honest mistake? If anyone lives in there, I’m sure they’re very confused about their lights turning on and off. But why wouldn’t they take control of their own lights? Maybe they can’t use them - but that doesn’t make any sense. Why would I be able to control their lights but they ca-*

I knocked on the door and startled myself. It felt almost automatic.

Unsure of what to do, I started to shuffle away and make my retreat. Then I decided to stay and wait. I waited for a few seconds. The pause was long and uncomfortable enough for my hand to instinctually rise for another round of knocking. 

A faint and vague sound, dampened enough to even be of my own mind. But it was the sound of dragging, or a thud of some kind with something rolling afterward.

*What was that?*

The sound might’ve continued, or my mind might’ve kept wandering.

*Maybe the neighbors?*

The walls were thin in this place. I could begin to hear indiscernible conversation somewhere down the hall. I could hear the hissing chatter of a TV show somewhere else.

Underneath all that though, in room 3118 - a rolling sound still. Maybe?

*What is that noise?*

I left not long after. I was getting freaked out and I’m sure I would’ve freaked out anyone living there.

When I got back to my place across the street, I felt very paranoid. I felt like I was being watched. I opened the squeaky door to my apartment and the long dark hallway of nine closed doors now made me nauseous with dread. I wanted to leave that apartment behind and run back into my mom’s arms or something - I felt like a child. 

I walked in, though. And I wish I hadn’t.

I took a scorching hot shower. It made me feel a little better, but I was still so paranoid. I kept hearing, or thought I was hearing, similar thudding and rolling sounds in one of the other rooms.

*Old pipes, that’s all.*

It took some more courage to leave the bathroom and enter the cold dark hall. I didn’t know what door to go through next - the kitchen door, bedroom door, or the extra door. My stomach was in a knot but I thought I should probably try and eat something.

It was around midnight by that point and I felt hopeless knowing there were so many more hours of dark left. I looked down at my half eaten peanut butter sandwich and knew this knot in my stomach wouldn’t go away if I didn’t have some kind of closure. I wanted to go into the extra room and turn off that switch for the night.

I braved the silent hallway again and opened up the ninth door into that grand room that turned the faintest sound into a booming echo. I walked up to the big window I always looked out of and, with great caution, looked up at room 3118. 

The light was still on - and there was something up there now.

I couldn’t tell what it was, but it looked like a big shadow. It wasn’t a person, but something boxy looking. Something square or just rigid, really.

*Furniture?*

*Did someone move something around in there?*

I didn’t know what I was looking at, and I honestly didn’t have the mental space to think about it much longer. I flipped off the light.

I flipped it back on.

I couldn’t deny my interest. I was very invested in this whole ordeal now.

The rigid thing started moving, at least I thought it looked like it was slowly changing position. It moved very smoothly and very, very slow. It looked like it was rolling or sliding.

It rolled from the right side of the window to the left. I flipped the switch here and there to see if it made any sort of difference. It didn’t seem to.

I watched it roll along for a few minutes from right to left until I jumped at the sight of the neighboring window’s light turning on. It was whoever lived in room 3116. I saw a person moving around in there and it looked like a more elderly man. He looked like he was listening closely to something, as if there were an intruder in his house.

I didn’t know what to do, but now I felt intrusive watching this man fumble around. I decided to switch the light off in 3118 and try to forget about the whole thing. I wanted to remove myself from this weird nightmare entirely. I decided that the next day I’d try to disconnect the switch and install some curtains. Find a new hobby. That all sounded like something rooted in everyday monotony and I let the comfort of curtain shopping lull me to sleep.

In my sleep that night, I heard the sound of aggressive wind chimes far away. They weren’t very melodic wind chimes, sort of just one tone that reverberated. Then I heard an awful banging sound. It was loud and most definitely not a dream. It sounded distant but it contained a lot of power. It was 3:48AM.

I tossed and I turned some until my bedroom started flashing red. I got out of bed and tried to see what was happening outside from my bedroom window but I couldn’t see through all the gloom trapped in between the glass. I had no choice but to go into the extra room if I wanted to see outside.

There was a large fire truck that was blocking off one side of the road and police were putting up caution tape on the other. Squad cars were rolling in one after the other. A few ambulances were present too but it seemed like no one was in a big rush. They were all circled around, their hands waving about in a casual, conversational way. At some point, one of them looked up and pointed and the others followed along. I followed the trajectory of the gestures all the way to the 31st floor. Room 3116 was now missing its pane of glass.

The curtains whipped out into the open world. The lights were still on and I could make out vague details of the interior.

Back on the ground, a few paramedics moved out of the way long enough for me to see what I was already preparing to see. The old man from room 3116 was laying there in a confusing mess of fabric, flesh, and bones surrounded by a growing puddle of blood. I was shocked.

*What the hell is going on?*

*What did I do?*

*Am I losing my mind?*

*Did I inadvertently kill that man?*

The next few days were a blur. My head was heavy with the endless hum of a thousand different thoughts all saying similar things. I felt an immense weight of guilt even though there was nothing tangible that connected me to the old man’s plunge. In my head, there was an ever growing web of continuity.

I uncovered the old switch, I flipped it incessantly and - in doing that - I created or resumed… something. That something looked like a giant fucking rectangle that rolled around and made a man jump to his death. Or maybe it pushed him out by force?

*But… why?*

*None of this makes any sense.*

*Maybe it’s all just make believe. I could’ve misunderstood what I saw - the rolling rectangle thing - maybe it was just an illusion. That old man, maybe it’s just a coincidence he chose tonight to leap.*

*I know what I saw…*

I no longer was going into the extra room for any reason. The thought of that big empty space with that damn switch made me nauseous. I couldn’t stand sleeping just a few doors away from it. I wanted to move out and get away. I should’ve done that. Reality doesn’t make room for fiction, though. I couldn’t and still can’t afford to break my lease, not by a long shot. That’s three rent payments and a bundle of paperwork in this godforsaken building. The apartment’s obviously outdated so I thought about making a case for lead paint or something toxic that could maybe get me out of here for free and quick but I’m not sure how that’d blow over. I don’t even know how to go about doing something like that.

I chose the route of avoidance. If I could ignore the extra room, the mystery switch, the dead man’s browning blood stain on the road, and the rolling rectangle monster whose whereabouts weren’t known - maybe it’d all just fade away with time. 

A few weeks went by and that strategy was seeming to work. Even in that short time, I was afforded some hindsight of the whole event - how I was jumping to conclusions, being paranoid, and maybe not appreciating my deteriorating vision that was probably making some serious guesswork. 

Still, there was no explaining away the light switch. That switch is undoubtedly connected to room 3118 across the street for some unknown reason. I must’ve tested it hundreds of times. I tried to not let that fact dig too deep when I couldn’t sleep or when I’d think I heard the rolling sounds across the apartment late at night.

Eventually, I had saved up enough money to treat myself with some more furniture. I wanted to reclaim the extra room and make it mine. I started with a thrifted recliner and some shelves. I was planning on making it a home theater after all. I had plans to bury the big casement windows behind blackout curtains.

Earlier tonight, I was moving some new finds into the home theater. The room’s echo was just as booming and awful as when it was empty and I flinched with every screech and scrape the furniture would make when I moved it. As I heaved the new TV stand around, my eyes subconsciously checked on room 3118 - a reflex that must’ve been built into me after all those cold nights. The lights were off as I had left them the last time I flipped the switch.

The lights were on in room 3116.

*Don’t… don’t freak out.* 

*Maybe someone new moved in.*

I watched longer than I should’ve. I don’t know why I’m so nosey. Always trying to get to the bottom of everything.

I watched and waited for any sign of movement in room 3116. I never saw a soul in there.

At some point, the big coat lady came out of the building with her dog and, for some stupid reason, I felt compelled to go talk to her.

*I just need to be sure of something.*

I walked casually down the sidewalk, waiting to “run” into her again. I was going to ask her if she had a lighter and then I was going to ask her if she had any information on room 3116.

Eventually, she reappeared around the corner with her feisty little dog walking on its hind legs, strangling itself with the leash.

I was leaned up on the wall next to the door I had snuck in weeks before, waiting to say my line.

“Excuse me,” I said. “Do you have a light?”

She looked up with confusion. 

“Like a flashlight?” she asked.

I flashed my carton of cigarettes.

“Oh, no honey - I’ve got asthma, sorry.”

“No problem,” I muttered back.

I tried to come up with anything else I could say so I could eventually segue into room 3116. Blanking, I simply stared ahead in disappointment. That’s when I noticed the faded bloodstain on the sidewalk from the old man. I clicked my tongue.

“Terrible what happened,” I muttered. 

The big coat lady turned around and saw what I was staring at, understanding immediately.

“Ugh, I know. I’m up on the 13th floor and I heard the uh - the sound.” She was slowly nodding and now staring at the old puddle of blood herself.

“I heard someone talking about how they already moved a new family into that unit he was in, is that right?” I asked, surprising myself.

“Oh, no. I think they’re letting it sit like they did with the last one,” she said. 

My brow raised. I tried to not act like an insane person and scare her off. 

“The last one?” I asked hesitantly.

“Yeah, it was just a few months ago - or maybe it was a year now - but the young couple that lived right next door to him jumped out the window too,” she said in a flat way.

I could’ve fainted. I felt dizzy and clammy, but I tried to keep my calm demeanor.

“That is, wow, I’m pretty new to the building so I hadn’t heard,” I stammered. I resigned from my niceties and my eyes went out of focus as my mind began jumping to its newest conclusion.

Somewhere in my peripheral, I noticed the lady nodding and looking down at her scraggly dog.

“Well, it sure is hard out here these days,” she said, breaking the silence.

She shuffled through the heavy apartment door which slammed behind her, startling me. Torn from my trance, I quickly retreated back to my apartment.

*Shit… shit!*

*What does this mean? That it - that rolling square thing - lives in that room and… what? Kills people in it and around it? Do the people kill themselves? Does the thing maybe inject them with something that makes them, I don’t know, suicidal? Or maybe they go crazy and just jump?*

I was thinking like a fucking lunatic. Like one of the cracked out vagrants wandering through the abandoned motels back in my hometown. I tried to slow myself down, but now I’d been given perfect evidence to suit my paranoid suspicions. At first, I was just trying to solve this complex series of events, then I remembered I was involved. I remembered the switch plays a role in this whole thing. The light switch in my home theater.

*How far can it move?*

*How far…*

*Could it cross the street and climb the stairs and break in?*

*Maybe it’s quiet or maybe it has some kind of way to silently open my door so I don’t notice. So the neighbors don’t notice…*

I found myself back in the home theater with some cheap whiskey in a plastic bottle. I sipped on it and enjoyed the aromatic sting that made me slowly feel braver with every gulp. I looked up at the 31st floor across the street. The lights were still on in room 3116.

*They’re probably just cleaning it out. You need to calm yourself.*

*None of this is your problem.*

I felt better and braver still with every new swig of the cruel whiskey. At some point, I hovered my hand over the light switch. The dwindling sobriety in me said no. The courageous drunken me said *I’m just curious*. My sight was beginning to sharpen and blur and I could tell I was swaying as I stood in front of those windows. I was drunk enough to where I felt like an observer of a faded memory from the past. I was drunk enough to where any action felt insignificant and all would be fine because nothing mattered. 

I flipped the switch, expecting the lights of room 3118 to blink on. The lights in room 3116 turned off instead.

*Shit!*

I don’t know why, but seeing those lights turn off made me duck and hide below the window. I felt like I woke the rolling thing up and now it could see me.

*Shit!*

*It moved. It fucking moved.*

Logic and reasoning was now out the window. The lights magically switched rooms and I can only imagine it’s because the square rolling thing now occupied - or will now materialize - inside of room 3116.

I continued hiding and thinking horrible thoughts to myself. I then did something I would’ve never done had I not been wasted. I grabbed a hammer and smashed that fucking light switch. I smashed it into a million pieces and then smashed those pieces into dust. I’m sure my neighbors were fuming but I had been quiet as a church mouse up until tonight.

Both room 3118 and 3116 now had no lights on and I had made the drunken assumption that now they were both safe. This all began when I turned the lights on in 3118. Now the lights would stay off forever and I made sure of it. Clearly I didn’t have the self control to stop myself from tinkering with this unknown thing. I doubt anyone else who would live here would have much more discipline. So I smashed the fucking switch into a million pieces.

It wasn’t long before I blacked out.

Something woke me up hours later. It was deep into the night. I was still in the home theater and still drunk but now also hungover. I tried to pull it together enough to figure out what woke me.

I had thought it was a loud sound, but maybe it wasn’t. The air felt like something loud had just occurred, but that was just a feeling - maybe one of paranoia. I looked out the window and half-expected to see another person or persons lying smashed on the ground after diving off the 31st floor, but I saw no such horror. Both 3118 and 3116’s lights were still off.

I rubbed my eyes and looked around the pitch black room. I felt my blood freeze.

There was a light on in my apartment. I could see the thin sliver of yellow illuminating underneath the door of the home theater.

*It’s in.*

I wanted to run at first, but then I wanted to sit still and just listen. So I sat there, waiting for something. Maybe it was waiting for me to make a move.

Then I heard it. Muffled, maybe in the kitchen - rolling. Finally, I could hear the sound in finer detail. The wheels sounded heavy, like the sound of a stone tomb opening. The cheap hardwood floor buckled and cracked underneath those giant rolling wheels which must’ve moved extremely slow and calculated - as if it was listening for my heartbeat.

I was frozen with fear and confused, so confused.

*What kind of nightmare has my life become?*

I wanted to try and make a break for it. I thought about running as fast as I could down my awful

hallway and ripping that front door open. It was only a few quick strides away. I sat up a little too quickly, adrenaline was kicking in. A spring in the shitty secondhand recliner I had passed out on popped causing an insignificant yet audible click throughout the house.

Rolling followed. It was very slow, so slow that one’s ear could lose the deep droning tone after long enough to background noise.

I slowly sat back and the recliner crinkled ever so softly. The thing made a noise so intentionally imperceptible I could hardly make it out. A metallic sliding sound. The sound of a door’s latch being methodically opened. It was leaving the kitchen and maybe it was moving onto one of the other doors now. 

The yellow sliver of light went out and the apartment was now totally dark.

Rolling persisted and I was barely able to perceive the noise. I spent the next few minutes sliding off my recliner with the precision of prey which I undoubtedly had become. Thirty minutes could’ve passed before I had crawled close enough to see under the door’s crack.

I carefully positioned my left eye to where I could see out into the black hallway just enough.

Something impossibly dark. Darker than the natural blackness of night. It was just sitting in the hall - waiting. It was large and boxy, just like that silhouette in 3118. It looked to almost perfectly fit the dimensions of the hall, leaving me sealed in.

*I’m dead.*

*Maybe not. Maybe I can call the police or something and distract it.*

*It’d kill them, though. Right? Then I’d be a murderer, maybe? Or maybe it would roll away. Maybe it isn’t bulletproof.* 

*I can’t have anyone else’s blood on my hands.*

*Maybe I can start a fire somehow and then the fire department will be able to rescue me from the window? Maybe that’s the stupidest thought I’ve ever had.*

*Too much noise. I can’t make any noise. I can’t make a sound or it’ll come get me.*

My thoughts were so frantic and visceral I feared even they would make a sound which could be intercepted by the masterful listener sitting mere feet away.

Another thirty minutes of eternity and I had silently made my way towards the large windows. I was so cautious and so deliberate in my movements as to not touch the tiniest plastic shard on the ground from when I had drunkenly destroyed the light switch.

*Maybe I made it angry by doing that. Maybe, in breaking the switch, the thing reverted back to me? Or maybe I exposed myself to it when I smashed that switch.*

I tried to use my phone and call for help, text for help, fucking email for help. None of it was going through. That damn rolling demon must’ve jammed my signal somehow. I ran out of hope. I froze in place. Eventually, I just started to write all of this. 

I’m still in the home theater, typing all of this out on my phone as quietly as I can, even sipping the last of my whiskey with the most delicate swigs one could imagine.

This whole thing is rather bleak, and I apologize if you stumble across this. I’ve scheduled this post to go up in eight hours, maybe by then the thing will have left and my final words will get out into the world to be forgotten or laughed at. I’m sure you think I’m insane or maybe I’m just a liar - and that’s okay - I know what happened here tonight. I don’t know how or why any of this happened, but I know the rolling thing outside my door is real. 

I don’t know why it’s here, what its motivation is, if it’s manmade or some impersonation of something we’d engineer or maybe it’s the very muse of humanity’s chase for right angles and industrial design. I now understand how those people in room 3118 and 3116 met their fate on the cracked pavement below. I think it wants me to kill myself. Either that or it’s totally content with me killing myself. It’s had me trapped in this room for hours now. It could’ve barged in and flattened me at any point, but it hasn’t yet. Funny how this all started in this damn extra room of mine. Funny how these windows are the ideal design and size for me to throw myself from this hellish place. 

I don’t know anymore. At t this point I’m just trying to buy time and sip more whiskey before the inevitable. I had been distracted in writing this for a few hours and and even began to have hope that when the sun came up, the thing would roll away. All I’d need is a few minutes to get out.

I don’t think I’m so lucky though. The sky is beginning to brighten into a deep blue and onc again I hear that steadDy rolling. so slow and meticulous, itt must only be moving a centimeter every fifteen minutes.

The whisky is is doing job and it’s becoming hard to type, harder to maintain literacy. I thikn I;ll wrap this up here. I’m sorry eveyone. I can only hope this is seen and if you did see this i thank you for keeping me company, in a Way. the suns almost up. I hear rolling and its close. The view from the window is very nice. Its looking like a nice day. I hope it iis a nice day,",3,1755467481.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1mt3q20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mt3q20/asked_a_guy_for_his_insta/,Asked a guy for his insta,"Recently I F(21) approached a guy I had seen around the sports centre when I had my netball training and asked for his insta. We both didn’t know each other. He said yes immediately after I asked, barely giving me time to process his reply and smoothly begun a conversation (eg asked for my name, what sport I played, etc) and later texted me first saying he was surprised and impressed about the move I had made. We texted everyday for a week, and he wasn’t dry, and he would continue the conversation whenever it felt like it was about to end by asking me questions, such as how often I go to training at the sports centre. I tell him that we should meet up sometime for a coffee after our trainings, which he says yes to and we meet up a week later. 

However, when we meet up, he was noticeably quieter than when I had first approached him, less smooth at continuing the conversation (but still would) and sometimes would burst out random questions. He was fidgeting at times (eg with his chin/jaw) and would look away when I asked him a question, or just not look at me much when we were talking, but was still talking and smiling normally. Coincidentally, he knew a girl who was working at the cafe and he was more talkative and bubbly with her but quieter and more reserved with me. I asked if they were friends and he was clear to say that she wasn’t, only a friend of a friend. Later I got a phone call and I left early to pick up my younger brother from school. He asked me if I had to leave and said see you.

It’s been a week now and he hasn’t texted me. I still occasionally see him at the sports centre and whenever we make eye contact, he would flinch and look away, but then look back and awkwardly smile. Did I misinterpret his actions as interest when it was only friendliness? Was he interested in me or was the whole thing only done out of politeness or awkwardness?

1mt3ptm,https://i.redd.it/x360uemuhnjf1.jpeg,Guy calling us “Dipshit Asians” protected by law,"Today, my husband and I had a minor fender bender — barely a tap on the car behind us. The driver, who stepped out smoking a joint, immediately asked for our insurance. As we got back into our car to retrieve the documents, he must have assumed we were trying to leave. He began kicking our car.

We tried to ask for his information, but he refused and kept insisting he only wanted ours. When we said we wanted to call the police, we also started taking photos of both cars. His bumper was already scratched up, while our car had hardly any mark at all — but we wanted evidence to protect ourselves from false claims.

That’s when he turned ugly. He started yelling “dipshit Asians” and spewing racist comments. When we pushed back, he smirked and said, “This is America. Freedom of speech. I can say whatever I want.” Then he threatened us: “Don’t let me see you around.” When my husband asked what he meant, he taunted us, pretending not to hear: “Huh? What did you say? Speak up. What did you say? Huh?”

When the police arrived, they treated it like a routine traffic incident. They told us to exchange information and, if needed, take it to civilian court. We asked about the threats, so they called another unit to handle harassment. But before they arrived, the man simply drove off. The officers shrugged and said, “Yeah, he’s allowed to leave.”

The second unit told us they could file a harassment report — but admitted it would likely go nowhere. They repeated the same line: freedom of speech. Unless he actually hurts someone, the law ties their hands. Their advice? “If you want it changed, take it up with lawmakers.”

I left that interaction shaken. Since when does the law protect aggressors over victims? Since when do police officers shrug at open threats and racist abuse? Freedom of speech was originally established to safeguard dissent, to allow people to speak truth to power without fear of government reprisal. But somewhere along the way, it has also become a shield for people who weaponize their words to demean, threaten, and intimidate — with no accountability.

It reminded me of when I first came to the U.S. in fifth grade. A boy “playfully” spat on me and another Asian girl for two days straight. When our teacher found out, she backed him into a corner and demanded an explanation. From her tone alone, he knew what he did was wrong. There was accountability. There was a clear line.

Today? A man can hurl racist abuse, threaten us, and drive away — with the police themselves saying the law protects him.

1.The Stewarts had just about enough of watching everyone else travel while they are stuck in Tennessee brushing their teeth on camera and choking down frozen meals, so they recruited Kelly Joe to earn her momager check and plan them a babymoon that was within driving distance of Carlin’s doctors, but also way more bougee than anything her sisters have done lately.  Before they skipped town, Carlin filmed herself getting another non haircut and rushed around linking everything in their home studio.  Layla and Zade are left in the dust and dumb and dumber fly off to Florida where the heavy filming and content gathering begin in earnest.  Kelly has an itinerary that includes an overnight stay in Fort Lauderdale and then a 2 hour Uber trip to their final destination… an all-inclusive, adults only retreat that charges upwards of a thousand dollars a night.  Carlin makes reel after reel with Mr. Thumb appearing as a background and side character only.  Carlin rates the trip a 6 out of 10, and says it was only “so so”.  I mean it’s hard to impress someone who has all of this same stuff in her backyard and was in Dubai for the holidays.  Perhaps she would have rated the vacation higher if she wasn’t traveling with Evan.  On the weekly vlog, they refer to each other as “bro”, say they watched a movie together… something they NEVER do… and Carlin actually wanted to have Evan go to dinner alone so she could just have a hamburger by herself.  Ah… young love.  They sit on the couch and prattle on and on about their “birth plan” which is that they have no plan at all.   Carlin is upset that she can’t have 15 people in the room while she gives birth.  Evan points out how the Bates sisters like to all be together at birth bc it’s just “something” about these “girls”. Yes, doofus… it’s a fertility cult.  That’s the “something”.  Anyway, Carlin rambles on about who she will choose to be her 2nd person at delivery, and never mentions the obvious choice… Kelly.  I guess Momma Bates is just another Stewart employee these days.  Evan will be lucky if he makes the cut.  They check out of the resort super early and head straight to the airport where they sit all day until a 9:30pm flight.  Just sitting in an airport for 12 hours, each of them “working”… doesn’t that sound like a little slice of heaven??  Back at the ranch, they give the kids their cheap amazon prizes and its back to work for Layla.  She has to make another “going to the nail salon” reel.  This time the script calls for her to use her tooth fairy money and say her lines while navigating the stairs.  Once again, Layla’s pronounced fake baby talk is back.  She’s almost 6 and says “wee-wy wong” and “so scited” and “pwease”.   Zade clocks in to help sell a new pool jet that turns your pool into a swim lane for exercising.  The whole family is super surprised about dad’s new toy.  The ad features Layla and Zade fighting for their lives against the current, and Carlin says it’s the best because their pool is on the “small side”.  All of the comments are just raving over the children’s skill in the pool.  According to these people, the Stewart kids are the next Olympic gold medalists.
 
 
 
2.Katie Clark’s management team has decided her niche is “young mother” and the Clark family will be “young parents taking on life”.  We see this theme in a reel about the influencer cruise where Katie says she wouldn’t trade anything about her life or the memories they are making.  It’s a voice over style video, but she still struggles with the words.  Katie is back on the Dime skincare along with Carlin, Whitney and Lydia so we get lots of her rubbing the hell out of her face this week and hiding in the bathroom to film.  After linking everything from the cruise, the Clarks head to New Jersey to meet Travis’ brother’s new baby.  They keep telling us that Travis is just buried in school work and has no free time, but here they are on their second trip in as many weeks.  Isn’t this how most students live??  Hailey is doing a great job these days of repeating whatever she is told and that helps mom make a new reel where she says, seemingly on cue, that Katie should get a new baby.  In the weekly vlog, Travis announces that he has a 3 week break coming up, and he is in class from noon-4 every day.  Poor beleaguered Katie having to do it all alone for 5 hours, 5 days a week.  What a super mom she is.  Travis takes the camera to class and films himself in class.  He’s just a young college kid with zero responsibilities.  For some reason, Katie is suddenly being subtitled in the vlog.  Anything she says has a subtitle attached.  Of course, all she really says is how amazing, smart and wonderful Travis is and how he looks like a scrubs model right out of a magazine.  Guess he didn’t want anyone to miss her gassing him up.  Katie brags about how Travis goes over his flashcards with her and quizzes her, so she is learning also.  Such a lucky little Tradwife.  I think that’s how most of the degrees are handed out at the Clark family college anyway…. The vlog is once again sponsored by the online counseling service and once again, they talk about how chaotic life is and how once upon a time Travis had anxiety and he talked to “someone” and that really helped him. These people have never, and will never, use this app.  They will cash the check, though.  In yet another passive aggressive moment, Travis talks about being questioned on his age and how he looks so young… but Katie?  Katie looks much older.  They talk all over themselves to try and cover what he said, but you know what they don’t do?  Edit that out.  Anyway, Katie gets back to linking everything in the house and says she is constantly asked about her skincare routine.  Where?  98% of her comments are about her kids and she knows it too.  The kids sell…. The latest reel of Hailey with the new baby has 3.7 million views and counting.
 
 
 
 
3.Josie Balka got back from her girls trip and homegirl went to work.  Josie has dropped about 9 new reels in one week’s time. She has cameras set up on tripods all around her house and she is even filming in the baby’s nursery now.  She wants us to believe that Baby Miles, at 18 months old, is a little fashionista.  Miles is featured in his first reel, so add him to the officially exploited crew.  For some reason we get a daily reel of Josie in her workout gear, waking up at an ungodly hour, sucking down a grimy protein drink and hitting the Jesus Gym before the sun comes up.  She flies home to make out with Kelton before he leaves and makes the same breakfast for her girls every single day.  The only anticipation was how far can she arch her back while opening a refrigerator and… what day will she finally wash her hair?  Friday is the answer, by the way.  She wraps her hair in the noodle, sweats like a D.O.T. Sign Holder in the Deep South in August, and then goes on about her day without washing that sweat mop for at least 4 days straight.  I don’t care, I don’t care, that’s just nasty.  Of all the reels she posts, guess which one gets the most views?  Miles loving clothes is the clear winner, of course.  Even the influencers who don’t exploit their children fully know that they must sprinkle them in to keep their views up.  Kids sell.  Sadly.  Kelton is continuing to build his plumbing Monopoly and that now includes him screaming into the void on IG while giving away tickets in exchange for 5 star google reviews.  He also took all of his employees to the baseball game where Josie had to mingle with the subordinates, including Tori and Bobby.  In a q and a, Josie says she doesn’t feel robbed of her youth at all and she is living her dream.  She refers to her fourth pregnancy as “fun” and says had Miles been a girl, his name would be Amelia.  She promotes Michael’s shop as the place for baby essentials and spends time replying to comments on her reels to up the engagement.  Not one mention of a supposed new house, but if we don’t hear something soon, I fully expect Warden to show up with his 2x4s to start building those triple bunk beds.
 
 
 
4.The Webster girls were allowed to have some church friends over to swim this week.  A Sunday School mom and her 4 kids, plus the 5 Webster kids all in the pool at one time means that Lurch had to add an extra scoop of chlorine at days end.  Alyssa proudly shows off Rhett holding a matchbox car and titles it “life with a boy”… like, can you even imagine? She is sent a new makeup brush and in order to keep it, she has to promote it, which means she musters up every ounce of joy she can find to go live on her stories.  The kids are absolutely wild in the background, but she just pushes through the noise to whine about her workout routine and how she has only had a few sips of coffee.  None of this has a thing to do with the brush, and I am sorry to whoever decided she was the one to promote it.  She also continues to show Rhett, at 2.5 wandering around in the yard in only a diaper.  Can the kid have a little dignity please?  After featuring another day of the girls stuck at a table with little strips of paper and crayons, the whole crowd heads to the ballpark to cheer on big John Webster at his pretend important softball game.  We see the girls playing badminton and standing around watching while Rhett learns to play dad’s game.  Finally after a long hot summer, it is co-op time again.  The girls are elated to get the heck out of the subdivision once a week, and they all line up with their backpacks and force smile so mom can filter their noses off for posterity’s sake.
 
 
 
5.A month or so ago, Zach and Whitney sat down with the Clarks for an interview.  In that interview Zach Bates said influencing and promoting his “cooking” channel were now his main focus.  Since that time we have seen him, and his wife, hit the influencing hard.  Seriously, Zach has given his sisters a run for their money with the constant content.  He hasn’t mentioned real estate since Katie and Travis signed on the dotted line.  BUT… don’t you DARE say he doesn’t sell real estate.  Man that makes him MAD.  SO mad that he will drive out to a house that’s up for sale and smash a PENDING sign on it and sneer at his camera while he tells you what a GREAT feeling that is.   Now, let’s not talk about the fact that he jumped back in his car, flew home, set up his tripod and filmed his kids in swimsuits helping him wash that car… and we definitely don’t want to talk about the numerous items he and Whitney are slinging links for, including their kids actual education… no, no, he is a REALTOR.  Whitney spends the week telling stories about Dime skincare and her hair vitamins and hoping someone believes that she actually drinks colostrum powder.  She and Zach load the kids up and take them to a local park so they can film them playing and tell everyone how madly in love they are while eating pizza and fighting off mosquitos.  Back at home Realtor Bates makes a Starbucks dupe for a pumpkin spice drink and then cooks pumpkin spice pancakes on the flat top along with what we call “pig candy”.  Its just bacon coated with brown sugar.  Definitely follow him for healthy eating tips.  Whitney hasn’t been to the Jesus Gym in a hot minute, but she does have a code for an at home workout she would like you to purchase.  She also pulls out 2 old fashioned desks and adds them to the play/school room for Khloe and Jadon.  She describes school as fun and entertaining… educational is nowhere in her description.  Baby Lilly turns 2 and she is ripe for their exploitation now.  They have the big kids help them decorate and bake a cake and Whitney manages to squeeze in a few more links before the celebration hits full swing.  This week our mega Real Estate Agent drops a YouTube commercial for a new pizza oven that was gifted to him but will cost you $250, plus accessories.  Right off the bat, our master chef burns the fool out of his hand by grabbing the molten hot stainless steel handle and it is pretty much downhill from there.  Dude and his hyperhidrosis burns most of the pizza he makes and lets his kids wallow all over the ingredients while nary a hand wash happens.   As busy as Zach is selling houses all over the greater Knoxville area, he still finds time to help Gil put a roof on a shed.  Zach is on the roof with Gil making “screw” jokes and Gil ain’t having it.  It was somewhat satisfying to watch dear old dad turn away from the camera and scold Zach about talking that way.  Never forget where you came from, Zach. 
 
 
 
6.Trace and Lydia finally got out of the tiny house this week and headed to Florida with the Romeike family for a week of sunshine, swimming, and handing their kids off to other people.  Before hitting the road, Lydia has a visit with Josie and then has to attempt to keep a straight face while selling a red light mask.  She exaggerates the benefits of the mask but never puts it on her actual face.  Trace manages to squeeze in more boring golf content with Evan.  Who is asking for this from these 2 goobers?  Their rental house for the week has a pool just steps away from the back door, but Lydia’s sisters are all there to keep an eye on Ryker.  The weekly vlog shows them playing pool, playing in the pool, taking Ryker and the newborn to the beach, and cooking fajitas for family lunch.  Lydia does share a reel of their date night where they are full on making out for the camera she sets up in the middle of the street.  Can you imagine walking up on that?  Can you imagine PARTICIPATING in that?  Eek.  Anyway, Lydia has finally hit the big time, and she can thank baby Kaia for that.  Her reel making fun of her newborn losing hair has 5.5 million views and that should help keep Trace from a full time job for a few more months at least.
 
 
 
7.Michael veered away from her weird Christian health recipes and made Zach’s banana nut bread muffins this week.  After taking a walk around her yard, she posts a picture of a common white mushroom and asks for help identifying it.  Reckon Abeka science doesn’t offer a fungi lesson?  In other news, Brandon and Michael are celebrating their 10th wedding anniversary.  She shares lots of pictures from their wedding and says she and Brandon rode out to the church where their ceremony happened.  Earlier this year, they announced an Alaska trip to celebrate ten years, but maybe that was postponed when the foster children came to stay.  Michael calls Brandon “my love” and he stays absolutely silent, per usual.
 
 
 
8.Erin Paine is prepping for the newest miracle blessing’s arrival.  The time is drawing nigh.  In the meantime, we see Brookie and Carles performing at their church’s summer play.  They are the featured soloists for a lighthearted, fun little tune called “Pierced and Bruised”…. The verses talk about how Jesus was beaten to a pulp to pay for their transgressions.  Just something silly for the littles, you know.  Addee is there for the performance, and because Erin needs a stand in near the end of her pregnancy.  She continues to take pictures of baby William wearing nothing but a diaper and continues to praise Chad for being her whole world.  This week’s vlog is about Erin packing her hospital bags.  She shows off her yard sale find rocking chair and the diaper bag given to her by a friend.  She links almost everything, and shares her discount codes, so she is learning how to leverage her YouTube audience for income.  We shall see how long Chad allows her to be the breadwinner this time.
 
 
 
9.Lawson and Tiffany and their insanely cringe worthy content just role on.  He can’t decide if he wants to be nekkid, a country singer, star in a family themed sitcom…. Or all of the above. I guess while they were on their Alaska trip he had Tiffy film him lip synching one of his songs while he gestures wildly from the back of a train so this week we get to see that.  Right after dropping a new song, he drops an old song that talks about a blue eyed girl.  It’s the weirdest marketing push ever and sends Tiffy into a tailspin, commenting “BROWN eyed girl” everywhere she can.  Seems like he would just put that tune in the vault, but then it would be harder to be passive aggressive towards his wife.  They make reels where he crushes a water bottle behind her, then one where he jacks her up on a wall, and he spends a ton of time holding his phone while spinning baby Will around and around.  That kid is constantly jostled and jerked.  Tiffany makes another reel about Lawson’s ex-girlfriends… and this one gets 6.2 million views.  It’s perfect for teenaged girls the world over.  What secure married woman is sitting around discussing her husband’s old girlfriends?  They constantly paint her as the hapless, ignorant, spend happy wife and he is the buff, strong, bread winning husband.  Their reality is probably the exact opposite.  The more viral these reels become, the more they make.  Their last vlog teased a gender reveal coming soon, and they are busy deleting every comment that says “Zach already gave it away”.  They’ve known the gender since she was 10 weeks pregnant, so the secret was bound to slip.  Truly these 2 could keep the Red Flag Guy in business all on their own.

1mt3obz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BringingUpBates/comments/1mt3obz/breaking_down_bates/,Breaking Down Bates,"1.The Stewarts had just about enough of watching everyone else travel while they are stuck in Tennessee brushing their teeth on camera and choking down frozen meals, so they recruited Kelly Joe to earn her momager check and plan them a babymoon that was within driving distance of Carlin’s doctors, but also way more bougee than anything her sisters have done lately.  Before they skipped town, Carlin filmed herself getting another non haircut and rushed around linking everything in their home studio.  Layla and Zade are left in the dust and dumb and dumber fly off to Florida where the heavy filming and content gathering begin in earnest.  Kelly has an itinerary that includes an overnight stay in Fort Lauderdale and then a 2 hour Uber trip to their final destination… an all-inclusive, adults only retreat that charges upwards of a thousand dollars a night.  Carlin makes reel after reel with Mr. Thumb appearing as a background and side character only.  Carlin rates the trip a 6 out of 10, and says it was only “so so”.  I mean it’s hard to impress someone who has all of this same stuff in her backyard and was in Dubai for the holidays.  Perhaps she would have rated the vacation higher if she wasn’t traveling with Evan.  On the weekly vlog, they refer to each other as “bro”, say they watched a movie together… something they NEVER do… and Carlin actually wanted to have Evan go to dinner alone so she could just have a hamburger by herself.  Ah… young love.  They sit on the couch and prattle on and on about their “birth plan” which is that they have no plan at all.   Carlin is upset that she can’t have 15 people in the room while she gives birth.  Evan points out how the Bates sisters like to all be together at birth bc it’s just “something” about these “girls”. Yes, doofus… it’s a fertility cult.  That’s the “something”.  Anyway, Carlin rambles on about who she will choose to be her 2nd person at delivery, and never mentions the obvious choice… Kelly.  I guess Momma Bates is just another Stewart employee these days.  Evan will be lucky if he makes the cut.  They check out of the resort super early and head straight to the airport where they sit all day until a 9:30pm flight.  Just sitting in an airport for 12 hours, each of them “working”… doesn’t that sound like a little slice of heaven??  Back at the ranch, they give the kids their cheap amazon prizes and its back to work for Layla.  She has to make another “going to the nail salon” reel.  This time the script calls for her to use her tooth fairy money and say her lines while navigating the stairs.  Once again, Layla’s pronounced fake baby talk is back.  She’s almost 6 and says “wee-wy wong” and “so scited” and “pwease”.   Zade clocks in to help sell a new pool jet that turns your pool into a swim lane for exercising.  The whole family is super fake surprised about dad’s new toy.  The ad features Layla and Zade fighting for their lives against the current, and Carlin says it’s the best because their pool is on the “small side”.  All of the comments are just raving over the children’s skill in the pool.  According to these people, the Stewart kids are the next Olympic gold medalists.
 
 
 
2.Katie Clark’s management team has decided her niche is “young mother” and the Clark family will be “young parents taking on life”.  We see this theme in a reel about the influencer cruise where Katie says she wouldn’t trade anything about her life or the memories they are making.  It’s a voice over style video, but she still struggles with the words.  Katie is back on the Dime skincare along with Carlin, Whitney and Lydia so we get lots of her rubbing the hell out of her face this week and hiding in the bathroom to film.  After linking everything from the cruise, the Clarks head to New Jersey to meet Travis’ brother’s new baby.  They keep telling us that Travis is just buried in school work and has no free time, but here they are on their second trip in as many weeks.  Isn’t this how most students live??  Hailey is doing a great job these days of repeating whatever she is told and that helps mom make a new reel where she says, seemingly on cue, that Katie should get a new baby.  In the weekly vlog, Travis announces that he has a 3 week break coming up, and he is in class from noon-4 every day.  Poor beleaguered Katie having to do it all alone for 5 hours, 5 days a week.  What a super mom she is.  Travis takes the camera to class and films himself in class.  He’s just a young college kid with zero responsibilities.  For some reason, Katie is suddenly being subtitled in the vlog.  Anything she says has a subtitle attached.  Of course, all she really says is how amazing, smart and wonderful Travis is and how he looks like a scrubs model right out of a magazine.  Guess he didn’t want anyone to miss her gassing him up.  Katie brags about how Travis goes over his flashcards with her and quizzes her, so she is learning also.  Such a lucky little Tradwife.  I think that’s how most of the degrees are handed out at the Clark family college anyway…. The vlog is once again sponsored by the online counseling service and once again, they talk about how chaotic life is and how once upon a time Travis had anxiety and he talked to “someone” and that really helped him. These people have never, and will never, use this app.  They will cash the check, though.  In yet another passive aggressive moment, Travis talks about being questioned on his age and how he looks so young… but Katie?  Katie looks much older.  They talk all over themselves to try and cover what he said, but you know what they don’t do?  Edit that out.  Anyway, Katie gets back to linking everything in the house and says she is constantly asked about her skincare routine.  Where?  98% of her comments are about her kids and she knows it too.  The kids sell…. The latest reel of Hailey with the new baby has 3.7 million views and counting.
 
 
 
 
3.Josie Balka got back from her girls trip and homegirl went to work.  Josie has dropped about 9 new reels in one week’s time. She has cameras set up on tripods all around her house and she is even filming in the baby’s nursery now.  She wants us to believe that Baby Miles, at 18 months old, is a little fashionista.  Miles is featured in his first reel, so add him to the officially exploited crew.  For some reason we get a daily reel of Josie in her workout gear, waking up at an ungodly hour, sucking down a grimy protein drink and hitting the Jesus Gym before the sun comes up.  She flies home to make out with Kelton before he leaves and makes the same breakfast for her girls every single day.  The only anticipation was how far can she arch her back while opening a refrigerator and… what day will she finally wash her hair?  Friday is the answer, by the way.  She wraps her hair in the noodle, sweats like a D.O.T. Sign Holder in the Deep South in August, and then goes on about her day without washing that sweat mop for at least 4 days straight.  I don’t care, I don’t care, that’s just nasty.  Of all the reels she posts, guess which one gets the most views?  Miles loving clothes is the clear winner, of course.  Even the influencers who don’t exploit their children fully know that they must sprinkle them in to keep their views up.  Kids sell.  Sadly.  Kelton is continuing to build his plumbing Monopoly and that now includes him screaming into the void on IG while giving away tickets in exchange for 5 star google reviews.  He also took all of his employees to the baseball game where Josie had to mingle with the subordinates, including Tori and Bobby.  In a q and a, Josie says she doesn’t feel robbed of her youth at all and she is living her dream.  She refers to her fourth pregnancy as “fun” and says had Miles been a girl, his name would be Amelia.  She promotes Michael’s shop as the place for baby essentials and spends time replying to comments on her reels to up the engagement.  Not one mention of a supposed new house, but if we don’t hear something soon, I fully expect Warden to show up with his 2x4s to start building those triple bunk beds.
 
 
 
4.The Webster girls were allowed to have some church friends over to swim this week.  A Sunday School mom and her 4 kids, plus the 5 Webster kids all in the pool at one time means that Lurch had to add an extra scoop of chlorine at days end.  Alyssa proudly shows off Rhett holding a matchbox car and titles it “life with a boy”… like, can you even imagine? She is sent a new makeup brush and in order to keep it, she has to promote it, which means she musters up every ounce of joy she can find to go live on her stories.  The kids are absolutely wild in the background, but she just pushes through the noise to whine about her workout routine and how she has only had a few sips of coffee.  None of this has a thing to do with the brush, and I am sorry to whoever decided she was the one to promote it.  She also continues to show Rhett, at 2.5 wandering around in the yard in only a diaper.  Can the kid have a little dignity please?  After featuring another day of the girls stuck at a table with little strips of paper and crayons, the whole crowd heads to the ballpark to cheer on big John Webster at his pretend important softball game.  We see the girls playing badminton and standing around watching while Rhett learns to play dad’s game.  Finally after a long hot summer, it is co-op time again.  The girls are elated to get the heck out of the subdivision once a week, and they all line up with their backpacks and force smile so mom can filter their noses off for posterity’s sake.

Ive been searching for help for the last few weeks now and this is my last place for help. I tried posting once for help and had nothing but trolls, and not real people who want to help so I took it down. I havent been helped yet and im severely stressed out. Im a mom with a 2 year old at home, im not in the best situation but my car is the only thing that helps me do deliveries through instacart. I havent been able to work since i injured my back really badly a few weeks ago and had to go to the er for it. I am doing better now and can do the deliveries, im just due on the payment for the car as im severely behind and they are letting me just do a small payment for now till I fully get on my feet again.

I managed a coffee shop for a while before my health issues started to get worse and the pay wasn't worth it, so I left and then worked as server for a japanese restaurant for a while till I left when I was having tremor like symptoms in my body and some functions I have issues with. Im getting a neurological appointment scheduled as its something deeper than ive been getting tested for, while this is all been happening ive had my 2 year old boy to take care of.

**Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)**

**Map Your Target Market**

* Pick 3-5 specific job titles you want
* Research 20-30 companies in your field
* Find the hiring managers on LinkedIn (not just HR)
* Create a simple spreadsheet to track everything

**Phase 2: The Application Strategy (Week 2-4)**

**The 48-Hour Rule** Apply within 48 hours of a job posting. After that, you're competing with hundreds more applicants.

**Where to Actually Look:**

* Company websites directly (50% of your applications)
* Industry-specific job boards (30%)
* LinkedIn (20%)
* Skip Indeed/Monster - too much competition

**The Application Stack:**

1. Tailored resume for each industry (not each job)
2. Cover letter template you customize
3. LinkedIn message to hiring manager
4. Follow-up email sequence

**Phase 3: The Network Effect (Ongoing)**

**The Coffee Chat Strategy:**

* Reach out to people doing your target job
* Ask for 15 minutes of career advice (not a job)
* 70% will say yes if you're genuine
* Many jobs come from these conversations

**Sample LinkedIn message:** ""Hi \[Name\], I'm exploring careers in \[field\] and really admire your path at \[Company\]. Would you have 15 minutes for a quick coffee chat about your experience? Happy to work around your schedule.""

**Phase 4: Follow-Up Game**

**The Magic Timeline:**

* Day 0: Apply
* Day 3: LinkedIn message to hiring manager
* Day 10: Follow-up email
* Day 21: Final follow-up

**Most people never follow up. This alone puts you in the top 10%.**

**Phase 5: Interview Prep**

**The STAR Method for behavioral questions:**

* Situation: Set the context
* Task: What needed to be done
* Action: What you specifically did
* Result: Quantifiable outcome

Prepare 5-7 STAR stories that cover different skills.

**The Real Talk Section:**

**What's Actually Killing Your Job Search:**

* Your resume looks like everyone else's
* You're applying to jobs you're 50% qualified for (aim for 70%+)
* You're not following up
* Your LinkedIn is outdated
* You're only applying online instead of networking

**Timeline Expectations:**

* Entry level: 3-6 months average
* Mid-level: 2-4 months
* Senior level: 4-8 months
* Career change: Add 2-3 months to any of the above

**Red Flags to Avoid:**

* Applying to 100+ jobs with same resume
* No follow-up strategy
* Ignoring company culture research
* Weak LinkedIn presence
* Not preparing for common interview questions

**The Bottom Line:** Job searching is a numbers game, but smart numbers. Quality applications + consistent follow-up + networking = results.

We will also cover essential buying considerations and frequently asked questions to ensure you find the perfect 60 ml cup for your specific requirements.

## Key Features Analysis

The modern 60 ml cup isn't just about volume; it's about precision, durability and design. Advanced manufacturing techniques and varied materials have led to a wide array of options, each with its own set of advantages.

**material Composition:** The composition of a 60 ml cup is paramount to its durability, thermal properties, and safety. Cups can be made from a variety of materials including borosilicate glass, stainless steel, porcelain, and BPA-free plastics. Each material offers unique characteristics; for example,borosilicate glass is renowned for its resistance to thermal shock,making it ideal for both hot and cold beverages,while stainless steel is highly durable and resistant to corrosion,ensuring longevity. The choice of material will significantly impact the cup's overall performance and usability.

**Dimensional Accuracy:** A 60 ml cup must accurately hold the specified volume to ensure consistent results.This hinges on precision manufacturing and stringent quality control processes. High-quality cups undergo rigorous testing to guarantee accurate volume measurement, which is especially crucial for applications requiring precise dosing, such as medicine preparation or scientific experimentation.Some cups may even feature etched or printed volume markings for added accuracy and convenience, providing a visual confirmation of the liquid level.

**Thermal Resistance:** Thermal resistance is a significant factor, particularly for cups intended for hot beverages. Cups made from materials like borosilicate glass or double-walled stainless steel offer superior insulation, keeping hot liquids warm longer and preventing external condensation. This feature enhances the user experience by making the cup more comfortable to hold and protecting surfaces from heat damage. Additionally, microwave safety becomes a consideration when choosing materials, as not all materials are suitable for microwave use.

**design and Ergonomics:** Beyond functionality, the design of a 60 ml cup contributes to its usability and aesthetic appeal. Ergonomic considerations include the shape of the cup, the thickness of the rim, and the presence of a handle.A well-designed cup fits comfortably in the hand, making it easy to grip and pour, while a smooth rim enhances the drinking experience. Some cups may also feature non-slip coatings or textured surfaces to improve grip and prevent accidental spills.**Durability and Longevity:** The ability to withstand daily use and repeated washing is a critical attribute for any 60 ml cup. Durable materials like stainless steel and high-quality plastics resist cracking, chipping, and staining, ensuring that the cup maintains its integrity over time. Reinforced rims and sturdy construction further enhance durability, preventing damage from accidental drops or impacts. A long-lasting cup provides excellent value by minimizing the need for frequent replacements.

**Ease of Cleaning:** A cup that is easy to clean saves time and effort and maintains hygiene. Many modern 60 ml cups are dishwasher-safe, simplifying the cleaning process. Smooth, non-porous surfaces prevent the buildup of residue and stains, while wide openings allow for easy scrubbing. For cups with intricate designs or textured surfaces, a dedicated cleaning brush might potentially be necessary to ensure thorough cleaning.

## Core Benefits

The true value of a 60 ml cup extends beyond its technical features,offering significant benefits in various practical applications.

**Precise Dosing:** The primary benefit of a 60 ml cup is its ability to deliver accurate and consistent measurements. This is especially important in medical contexts, where precise dosages of liquid medications are critical for patient safety. A clearly marked and accurate 60 ml cup ensures that patients receive the correct amount of medication, minimizing the risk of adverse effects. Similarly, in culinary applications, precise measurements are essential for achieving consistent results in recipes.

**Portion Control:** For individuals focusing on dietary control, a 60 ml cup facilitates accurate portioning of food and beverages. this allows for better management of calorie intake and helps prevent overconsumption. Whether measuring out sauces, oils, or nuts, the 60 ml cup provides a visual and measurable guide for maintaining portion sizes. This can be particularly beneficial for those with specific dietary needs or weight management goals.

**Consistent Espresso Shots:** Baristas rely on precise measurements to create consistent and high-quality espresso drinks. A 60 ml cup is ideal for measuring double shots of espresso, ensuring that each drink meets the required standards. Using a dedicated 60 ml cup eliminates guesswork and variability, allowing baristas to produce consistently flavorful and balanced espresso beverages. This is crucial for maintaining customer satisfaction and brand reputation.

**Simplified Recipe Preparation:** In the kitchen, a 60 ml cup simplifies recipe preparation by providing a convenient tool for measuring small quantities of ingredients. This eliminates the need for cumbersome measuring spoons or guesswork, making the cooking process more efficient and accurate. Whether measuring vanilla extract, lemon juice, or other liquids, the 60 ml cup ensures that ingredients are added in the correct proportions, contributing to the overall success of the recipe.

**Educational Purposes:** In educational settings, 60 ml cups can be used to teach children about measurement and volume. They provide a hands-on way to explore these concepts, making learning more engaging and interactive.Educators can use 60 ml cups to demonstrate volume relationships, conduct simple science experiments, or teach basic cooking skills.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions can help potential buyers make informed decisions and understand the best use cases for a 60 ml cup.

**What Materials Offer the Best Durability for a 60 ml Cup?**
Stainless steel and high-quality, BPA-free plastic are generally considered the most durable materials.Stainless steel is resistant to corrosion and impact, while high-quality plastic can withstand daily use and washing without cracking or breaking.

**Can I Use a 60 ml Cup for Both Hot and Cold Liquids?**
Yes, it depends on the material. Borosilicate glass and double-walled stainless steel cups are designed to handle both hot and cold liquids without issues. However, some plastic cups may not be suitable for very hot liquids due to potential deformation or leaching of chemicals.

**How Do I Ensure the Accuracy of a 60 ml Cup?**
Look for cups with clear and precise volume markings, either etched or printed onto the cup. To verify accuracy, you can use a calibrated measuring device, such as a graduated cylinder, to compare the actual volume held by the cup against its marked capacity.Also, be cautious of inexpensive plastic cups with inaccurate measurements.

**Are There Any Safety Considerations When Using a 60 ml Cup?**

1mt3by4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArseneaultCorruption/comments/1mt3by4/corruption/,Corruption,"
Last year in April, 12th 2024, an educator came to my business to let me know she had witnessed my son be assaulted physically and verbally by a educator there, she works in the 2 year old room. 
He has (I have all of them) 20 injury reports from this daycare in 1 year. 

The RCMP fumbled this entire thing, they never questioned anyone besides the owner despite educators and parents telling them that the owner Lisa Arseneault (former politician in town and related to Donald Arseneault)  was aware and would not do anything. Other educators had told Lisa and wound up being silenced, bullied at work and Lisa would not make reports of abuse to EECD. 
They also told us parents that the kids were too young to talk. Despite having a worker come forward and give them a list of names of former educators and people who witnessed what she saw but they still didn’t question these people (one being the educator that came forward July 2025) 
The RCMP never communicated with myself or my boyfriend about anything or the process. 

Flash forward to July 11th, 2025 and we have a second worker that came forward to the RCMP to make a statement of what she saw and it backs up what the first educator saw. Physical violence and verbal abuse. 
The officer kept asking all of us parents and educators “well, do you really want to report this, it’s not going to go Crown.”
We said yes we did. That we wanted to make our statements! 

If RCMP had questioned staff at Tic Tac Toe last year, then we wouldn’t be here. 

Then there’s also the tackling of the daycare inspectors that had multiple educators and parents who told the daycare inspectors, Mona Martin and Janelle Aube, what they saw/experienced and they did nothing. Kept no reports at all. 
All educators at TTT and others told me that Lisa the owner and Mona, the inspector will have some coffee, laugh, glance around and that’s it. That’s not a proper inspection!! 

The owner of the daycare Pierre Arsenault (Donald Arsenault’s brother. Our former MLA) and his wife Lisa are telling her friends in town which are other business owners, that we (parents and educators) are all “friends trying to do a smear campaign”. 
For what reason I have no idea. The parents and educators have injury reports, and there’s big changes in our kids. 

I’m beyond frustrated and this is a political family, related to Donald Arseneault. How am I supposed to take that? 
Educators are on statement too stating that Lisa Arsenault and Pierre do favors for people around them and make sure they’re insulated. 
There are also other mothers I’m in contact with who were silenced, disregarded, shunned by the town into silencing or behaving. 
This is victim abuse, gaslighting and really beyond disgusting. 
The system has massively dropped the ball!

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal mens leather book bag balances aesthetics with practicality. Consider the following key features when making your selection:

**Material Quality:** A full-grain leather construction is paramount.

full-grain leather, derived from the top layer of the hide, boasts exceptional durability and develops a rich patina over time, adding character and distinction. cheaper grades like top-grain or bonded leather lack the longevity and visual appeal of full-grain. look for bags crafted from vegetable-tanned leather, which uses natural tannins for an environmentally conscious and aesthetically pleasing result.The thickness of the leather also matters, with thicker hides generally offering greater resilience.

**storage Capacity and Organization:** Internal compartments are key for organization.Different bags offer varying levels of storage and organizational features. Consider your daily carry needs. A dedicated laptop compartment, ideally padded and secured with a strap, is crucial for protecting your device.Internal pockets for pens, phones, wallets, and tablets contribute to effortless organization. External pockets, such as those with magnetic closures or zippers, provide easy access to frequently used items like keys or travel cards.

**Hardware Durability:** Zippers, clasps, and buckles should all be durable.

The quality of hardware components significantly impacts the longevity of a leather book bag. Opt for bags with robust zippers from reputable brands like YKK. Solid brass or stainless steel buckles and closures withstand wear and tear better than cheaper alternatives.Ensure that rivets and stitching are securely fastened to prevent them from loosening or breaking over time. These details, frequently enough overlooked, contribute significantly to the overall lifespan of the bag.

**Carrying Comfort:** Shoulder straps are vital for ensuring comfort.

A pleasant carrying experience is crucial, especially for those who commute or carry heavy loads. Look for bags with padded and adjustable shoulder straps made from breathable materials like canvas or mesh. A well-designed back panel with ergonomic padding can also improve comfort and reduce strain. Consider the weight distribution of the bag when fully loaded. Some bags feature a sternum strap to further stabilize the load and prevent the straps from slipping.

**Aesthetic Design:** Style should align with personal or professional needs.

The aesthetic design of a leather book bag is a matter of personal preference, but certain elements contribute to a timeless and professional appearance. Clean lines, minimalist hardware, and a sophisticated color palette (such as black, brown, or tan) make a lasting impression. Consider the overall silhouette of the bag – whether it's more structured and formal or relaxed and casual – and how it complements your wardrobe and personal style.

Regular cleaning and conditioning will protect the leather from damage and ensure its longevity.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about mens leather book bags:

Minor scratches and scuffs can often be addressed with leather conditioners or polishes. More serious damage, such as tears or rips, may require professional repair. A skilled leather repair specialist can often restore the bag to its original condition or make necessary repairs to extend its lifespan.Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any damage will help preserve the bag's integrity.

1mt38ql,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadanews/comments/1mt38ql/donalds_daycare_arseneault_m/,Donald’s Daycare (Arseneault m),"
Last year in April, 12th 2024, an educator came to my business to let me know she had witnessed my son be assaulted physically and verbally by a educator there, she works in the 2 year old room. 
He has (I have all of them) 20 injury reports from this daycare in 1 year. 

The RCMP fumbled this entire thing, they never questioned anyone besides the owner despite educators and parents telling them that the owner Lisa Arseneault (former politician in town and related to Donald Arseneault)  was aware and would not do anything. Other educators had told Lisa and wound up being silenced, bullied at work and Lisa would not make reports of abuse to EECD. 
They also told us parents that the kids were too young to talk. Despite having a worker come forward and give them a list of names of former educators and people who witnessed what she saw but they still didn’t question these people (one being the educator that came forward July 2025) 
The RCMP never communicated with myself or my boyfriend about anything or the process. 

Flash forward to July 11th, 2025 and we have a second worker that came forward to the RCMP to make a statement of what she saw and it backs up what the first educator saw. Physical violence and verbal abuse. 
The officer kept asking all of us parents and educators “well, do you really want to report this, it’s not going to go Crown.”
We said yes we did. That we wanted to make our statements! 

If RCMP had questioned staff at Tic Tac Toe last year, then we wouldn’t be here. 

Then there’s also the tackling of the daycare inspectors that had multiple educators and parents who told the daycare inspectors, Mona Martin and Janelle Aube, what they saw/experienced and they did nothing. Kept no reports at all. 
All educators at TTT and others told me that Lisa the owner and Mona, the inspector will have some coffee, laugh, glance around and that’s it. That’s not a proper inspection!! 

The owner of the daycare Pierre Arsenault (Donald Arsenault’s brother. Our former MLA) and his wife Lisa are telling her friends in town which are other business owners, that we (parents and educators) are all “friends trying to do a smear campaign”. 
For what reason I have no idea. The parents and educators have injury reports, and there’s big changes in our kids. 

I’m beyond frustrated and this is a political family, related to Donald Arseneault. How am I supposed to take that? 
Educators are on statement too stating that Lisa Arsenault and Pierre do favors for people around them and make sure they’re insulated. 
There are also other mothers I’m in contact with who were silenced, disregarded, shunned by the town into silencing or behaving. 
This is victim abuse, gaslighting and really beyond disgusting. 
The system has massively dropped the ball!

1mt3776,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mt3776,The Manner Hotel (Standard Hotels) SoHo NYC,"The Manner, Soho NYC – weekend stay

Couldn’t find much on here about The Manner so figured I’d share my experience. Stayed for a weekend and honestly, I’d give it a 9/10. It’s probably my new go-to hotel in NYC.

I originally had it booked with points but ended up switching to Amex Hotel Collection (THC) because ~$400/night with $100 credit was a better deal. Hotel nights and incidentals (not the room rate) should post to Hyatt. I’m only Discoverist and check-in seemed more focused on the Amex perks than Hyatt status anyway. We were also able to check in early at noon Friday, which was great. On Sunday we had 2pm checkout and they also let us hang out in “the apartment” and order lunch after checkout until it was time to leave for our train. 

When we arrived they explained the vibe and the “Apartment” amenities. Got upgraded to a high-floor king with a view. For NYC, the room was actually pretty decent — just enough space for two, with a real bathroom door (which shouldn’t feel rare, but in NYC it is). The design is bold and super cohesive: embroidered coasters, matching slippers, some of the nicest hotel glassware I’ve ever seen, and shelves of books instead of a TV. Also the bed was probably the best I’d slept on in years. They have a feather bed on top of the mattress and it’s exceptional. They also have a Bluetooth sound system in the room. 

Would I paint my own place like this? Probably not. But as a hotel vibe, it was fun. The books are all new and thoughtfully picked — I even found one I liked enough that I bought a copy. The books are well curated both in the room and in the hotel in general. People were curious and seemed to be enjoying and reading them. It was kinda cool. (They can bring a tv to the room in a briefcase ala James Bond.)

The vibe and friendliness is what really sold me. No TVs, lots of books, people actually hanging out and reading in the lounge. It gave the whole place a calm, slightly curious, community energy. Staff were great — helpful and nice without being over-the-top. It’s not three forks and a butler. They nail the “if your coolest friend in Soho loaned you their apartment for the weekend” vibe. 

The “Apartment” (guest-only lounge) was the best part: unlimited still/sparkling water, complementary breakfast, snacks during the day, and cocktails in the afternoon. Plus just a calm space to hang out in away from the bustle of New York.

Ordering food either in the Apartment or room service is super casual — no check to sign, just gets added to your bill. They do slap on a 25% auto-grat, which is steep, but probably makes sense given all the free stuff you don’t tip on. Pricing is classic New York hotel (think $15 fries, $20 cocktails). That said, the lunch I had was genuinely good, and it was nice to be able to work in such a quiet, comfortable space. Dinner out on the patio at The Otter was also great — highly recommend the fish & chips and the lemon rice pudding. And the complimentary breakfast wasn’t a token pastry — it was a spread: good pastries, yogurt, granola, and some solid breakfast entrees.

The rooftop is another highlight. During the day it’s guests-only (before 5pm Friday and noon on weekends), and it’s perfect to grab a coffee and a book and take in the views of both 1 WTC and the Empire State. One night we also went up for a nightcap — it was standing room only, but the staff realized we were staying at the hotel and let us sit in a reserved section for about an hour before the party arrived. That kind of hospitality was much appreciated and really made the night.

Couple things people might not love: it’s very Instagram-popular, so the restaurant/bar/rooftop can get busy in the evenings. I got the sense the hotel will always try to take care of guests, but it’s genuinely popular, so go early and/or have them help with reservations. And in true New York fashion, we had a whole video crew filming a commercial in the halls one morning. Honestly kind of cool, very NYC, but also a bit annoying to weave around when you’re just trying to grab coffee.

The location in Soho is fantastic — super fun, great food and shopping around, easy access to the rest of the city. Between the design, the perks, and the little touches, The Manner nails the “stylish, relaxed apartment” thing, and it’s memorable and was really fun. Definitely my favorite spot in the city now.",9,1755466141.0,hyatt,0,1.0,False

\- career choice / choice of study shouldn't be a speculative financial instrument, where you bet on the financial returns that your choice will make you in the future. 

\- talent for a certain high paying profession is given by birj-th and is not something you actually worked for. 

\- everybody's time in life is equally limited. Labor is being payed in return for giving a company your precious time on this planet that you could spend doing sth else. I don't think a garbage man's time (as in a chunk of his life) should be valued less than that of a speculator on the financial markets. 

\- the financial return of someone's labor != the actual value to society - this is a myth of the free market. A nurse's job is very labor intensive and therefore doesn't create a lot of profit per se, but it definitely is as valuable as a programmer's job. 

So in general I think: 

A job is a job and should be paid more or less the same (within a certain interval). If all the jobs are filled you will have to find another one than the one you originally wanted to do. So even in my system, where every job pays the same, not everyone can become a movie star. If all the movie star jobs have been filled, you'll have to find sth else. Long term unemployment is not accepted. 

The rest is back to supply and demand: you are an IT guy who makes bank sipping coffee on his desk and think it would be unfair if a garbage man, sne hauling people's trunks in an airplane would have it 'easy' if everyone made the same income > you just found what you would actually want to do if financial incentives weren't present and can finally go for it in my system. 

The part of the financial value you create that doesn't go to your salary should go to the government who will eg pay better wages to nurses with it and deliver other services. 

The only ways to make way more than the interval I proposed:

\- work more hours

\- start a company (even though i think companies should be taxed more as well than they are now, no need for billionaires)

Finally, I think inheritance tax and property taxes for your first home should be abolished: you own what you own and inheritance provides an incentive for entrepreneurs to work harder so they can leave sth to their children. ",0,1755466003.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,18,0.5,False

Amul Kool Blueberry – 30 bottles (20g protein each)

Amul Kool Arabia Coffee – 8 bottles (10g protein each)

Amul Kool Chocolate – 8 bottles (10g protein each)


What happened:

First delivery was smooth: Amul Kool Arabia Coffee (8/8 bottles) came on time with no issues.

After that, the trouble began. Every single day I’d get the standard Amazon message: “Your parcel is out for delivery”… followed by a failed delivery update at the end of the day with random reasons like:

“OTP unavailable”

“Customer denied package”

“Customer unavailable”


Each time I received a failure message, I tried calling the delivery agent (using the number + extension shared via WhatsApp).

Turns out, Amazon delivery numbers have all unknown calls blocked – so you can’t actually reach them. This feels very unprofessional, and I’ve seen this happen across multiple e-commerce deliveries.


Finally, on Sunday, 17th August, I got a direct call from a delivery agent asking for the OTP. I wasn’t home, so I asked him to leave the package with the security guard.


The shocker:

When I opened the box, it had only 4 bottles of Chocolate Amul Kool.

The rest of the box was stuffed with packing garbage.

At the same time, Amazon also marked my Amul Kool Blueberry (30 bottles) as “Delivered and handed over to resident.”

No OTP was taken.

No call received.

My house was locked at that time.



Now the app shows the entire order as delivered.

Next steps:

Tried calling Amul support – they were closed for the day. Will try again tomorrow, but honestly have very little hope in their supply chain after seeing how fucked up they have this supply chain working

Long-time lurker, first-time poster here. I've been fascinated by Bitcoin and crypto for years, but always just watched from the sidelines. The idea of ""getting in"" felt intimidating and risky, especially with all the crazy headlines.

A little over a month ago, a friend was telling me how they've been using this ""dollar-cost averaging"" strategy with some of their investments. It got me thinking. What if I just took a small, consistent amount of money—something I wouldn't even miss—and put it into Bitcoin every single day? So, on a whim, I decided to go for it. I figured, I spend at least $10 on a coffee or a snack I don't need pretty often, so why not put that money to work instead?

Today marks **day 37** of my personal Bitcoin challenge. Every day, no matter what the price is, I put in $10. I set a reminder on my phone so I don't forget. The goal is to do this for a full year, so I've got 328 days left to go.

It's been pretty wild to watch. Some days it feels like a genius move when the price goes up, and other days I'm just shrugging it off when it dips. Honestly, the daily routine has made me way less stressed about the price swings. It’s not about timing the market; it’s just about consistency.

Anyway, I just wanted to share my little journey. Has anyone else tried something similar? Any tips or thoughts? Wish me luck on the rest of this year-long ride!",83,1755465690.0,Bitcoin,19,0.97,False

## Key Features Analysis

The top maple powder brands of 2025 boast a range of features contributing to their quality, flavor, and versatility. These features are crucial when deciding which brand is best for your needs.

**Source and Processing:** High-quality maple powder starts with ethically sourced, 100% pure maple syrup, often from specific regions known for their superior maple production. The best powders are then processed using techniques that preserve the syrup's natural flavor and aroma,such as low-heat dehydration or spray-drying. Look for brands specifying their source and processing methods for openness and quality assurance.

**Granulation and Texture:** A fine, consistent granulation is essential for maple powder, ensuring even distribution of flavor and preventing clumping. The powder should dissolve easily in liquids and blend smoothly into dry ingredients. Look for ""finely ground"" or ""ultra-fine"" descriptions and consider user reviews regarding texture. Some brands also offer coarser grinds for specific applications.

**Flavor Profile:** The flavor profile of maple powder can vary depending on the grade of maple syrup used. Darker grades, such as Grade B (now Grade A: Dark Color, Robust Taste), typically produce a more intense, robust maple flavor, while lighter grades offer a more delicate sweetness. consider your intended use when choosing a flavor profile; bolder flavors are best for savory dishes, while lighter flavors are suitable for delicate desserts.

**Purity and Additives:** The best maple powders are made from 100% pure maple syrup, with no added sugars, fillers, or artificial ingredients.Check the ingredient list carefully to ensure you're getting a truly pure product. Some brands may include anti-caking agents, but ideally, these should be minimal and naturally derived if any.

Key features to consider:

*   Pure maple syrup origin

As someone who dabbles in everything from sketching to digital photo editing, this little gadget has been an intriguing companion. The model, officially titled “Inspiroy H640P,” piqued my interest right from the unboxing due to its lightweight design and a sleek matte finish that doesn’t scream for attention but quietly says, “I’m here to perform.”

**Compact Design without Compromise**  
Portability meets functionality with this device, and it’s apparent from the moment you lay eyes—or hands—on it. The surface area is just the right size, not too cramped for detailed work but compact enough to slide into my overstuffed messenger bag alongside my laptop. Its lightweight nature makes it easy to carry around to coffee shops or classrooms. Bonus points for being sturdy enough to endure my constant shuffling of gadgets. The six programmable express keys along the top are a dream for shortcuts, saving me valuable time while making my workflow incredibly smooth.

**Digital Pen Performance**  
The pen, which is battery-free (yes, no constant paranoid charging cycles), is genuinely one of its best features. With its 8192 pressure sensitivity levels and 5080 LPI resolution, I’ve managed to create precise strokes, whether working on a delicate watercolor effect or detailed photo touch-ups. The responsiveness is fantastic, with no noticeable lag. The transition between pen and eraser, accessible through a side button, is quick and intuitive, saving me from fumbling with menus. The pen holder, loaded with eight extra nibs, is a thoughtful touch because I might have a habit of wearing nibs down faster than most.

**Advantages**  
Here’s what makes this device truly stand out:  
- Works seamlessly across multiple platforms: Linux (Ubuntu), Mac, and Windows.  
- Android compatibility brings flexibility—using it with my phone to create quick sketches on the go was a pleasant surprise.  
- The included drawing glove eliminated palm friction, making long sessions extremely comfortable.  
- Excellent pressure sensitivity and high pen resolution make for precise and professional work.  
- Versatility in use, from drawing and photo editing to annotating during online teaching sessions via apps like Zoom and Microsoft Office.

**General Usability for Everyday Tasks**  
Its usability isn't just limited to professional-grade artwork; the Inspiroy H640P effortlessly adapts to simple note-taking and diagramming tasks. Remote work and virtual conferencing benefit significantly from it, where annotating over presentations in Zoom or PowerPoint feels natural. As someone prone to switch between creative and analytical tasks, this level of adaptability has been invaluable.

**Drawbacks**  
No product is perfect, and this one isn’t an exception. Here's where it could improve:  
- The lack of multi-touch support might disappoint those accustomed to zooming and panning with their fingers.  
- The express keys, though functional, are a bit stiff initially and require a break-in period.  
- Android integration feels a tad limited; certain features don’t translate as smoothly as they do on desktop platforms.  

**Competitive Options**  
Stacked up against its peers, the Inspiroy H640P holds its ground. For instance, Wacom’s entry-level tablets offer similar performance but typically at a higher price point. Meanwhile, XP-Pen boasts competitive pricing but lacks Huion's battery-free pen feature, something I’ve grown to deeply appreciate. The Inspiroy H640P thrives primarily in its balance between affordability and professional-grade performance, bridging the gap between casual hobbyists and seriously committed artists.

**Affordable Quality**  
Speaking of affordability, the price-to-value ratio is near unbeatable—especially when bundled with extras like the drawing glove and additional nibs. Many competitors don’t include such ""out-of-the-box"" utility. It offers enough features to outshine budget models while keeping pricing approachable for students, beginners, or pros on a budget. You’re truly getting more than what you pay for, which is rare in this segment.

1mt2w34,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenChristian/comments/1mt2w34/asked_to_step_down_from_worship_team/,Asked to step down from worship team,"So about a month and a half ago I posted on here about joining the worship team at my church and wondering if I had made a mistake. If you read it you may remember that I said I auditioned in February and then went through a long process  of waiting and other hoops and hurdles, and had to do a sort of secretive contract, and wondering with me being gay if it was a mistake. A lot of people said that it sounded like a cult. I decided to go ahead and try it out and see how it would go. I've played five times on keys, both Wednesday and Sunday services and sang one time. I even played this morning. 

Before we had done our run through of music this morning before church the pastor came up and talked to me and was asking me how I was doing. I could tell in his look that something was going on. He usually will to say hi to me how am I doing and maybe say a couple things. But he was talking a little bit more to me. He said at the end of our conversation he said hey why don't you come to my office after church today I just want to sit down and talk with you, and said you're not in trouble or anything. I immediately knew something was up. Part of me thought maybe he's just wanting to talk to me to see how my first month of playing has been going and see where my heart was, but the other part of me was like I have a feeling he might be asking me if I'm gay. Of course I ran through other things in my head but I knew I hadn't done anything bad, so that was running through my head while I was playing. It was a big day for service too today because it was a baptism Sunday. There were a lot of people at church today. I played the first two songs, and then we went to our seats. And then we had alter call at the end so we had one more song. Played it, and then ask church was being dismissed and I was putting the cover back on the piano, I saw the worship leader walking up to me. I kind of knew that she was going to come and tell me that there was a meeting for me. She told me there was a meeting, and she told me to just drink some water get my heart ready while I sat and waited for then to come. She said we thank you for all you've done, you've done great playing on keys, and know that whatever happens whatever decision is made we love you. And I was like okay is everything okay. She said yes you'll be okay just go get your heart ready. So I went and sat in the pastor's office. I prayed and asked God to give me strength and for whatever his will was that his will was done. 

The pastor came in, not the worship leader she didn't end up coming, but he said he had a question for me and that it was going to be a little awkward. I told him I knew where it was going. He asked me straight up are you gay? I didn't hesitate I shook my head and said yeah and it kind of defeated low voice. He said the only reason that he was asking me was because somebody in the church knew somebody else that knew me, and they told her that I was gay and she asked the pastor if they knew. He said no I didn't know. I explained to him that I didn't bring it up because while that is part of me, my focus was that my identity was in Christ. I told him that I never went in with any malicious intent, I never wanted to bring any focus on me, and I wanted to make sure that everything I did in worship was honest and leading people into honest true worship. And I did mention that another reason I didn't bring it up is cuz I don't ever introduce myself as hi my name is and I'm gay. Just like I don't go in and ask someone hey are you straight?. We had a long cordial conversation. I did cry a little bit, but I kept my composure. He did ask me how long I had been struggling with it. I said I've been getting my whole life, and to be honest I would never just willy-nilly choose to be gay because of all of the criticism and hate that a lot of gay people get. I told him about how I was bullied in high school after I came out to one person and it went all around the school. I had even been threatened by someone that they were going to end me. So I said I would never choose to go through this criticism this is just something that's part of me, and I didn't feel it was really anyone's business. 

Long story short he told me that I could serve in the coffee shop, or is a door greeter, or on lights and sound, but worship team and preaching were off limits. He said he wanted me to still continue to come, and even said they may reconsider letting me stay on the worship team if I could tell them that I was done with being in same-sex relationships and wasn't going to pursue any same sex relationships. I did explain to him that I haven't been in one in a long time, but that I couldn't guarantee anything. He of course tried to pass it off as love. He said that he loves me and wants me to still come doesn't want me to leave angry, and wanted me to still serve on other teams, but that his love for me and everyone doesn't mean that he has to agree with me. 

Like I said we were cordial in the conversation and I kept calm a lot better than I thought I would. But I am struggling with if I would want to even serve on one of the other teams or continue to attend. I know people would start asking me at some point why I wasn't playing or singing up there anymore, and I feel like it would be hard to explain that without outright saying why I'm not up there. I feel like it wouldn't make any sense for me to say oh the pastor wanted to use me and other places like the coffee shop, as nobody on the worship team has been moved like that, and especially after only being on the worship team for a month. I was really numb for the first hour after church and then it hit me and now I just feel really hurt. Not just hurt by them asking me to step down, but also that someone went out of their way to out me.",2,1755465387.0,OpenChristian,10,1.0,False

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited.

ABOUT
He got the nickname “Barista” from a drug called Pika (a term meaning “title,” often linked to coffee) that he distributes in Southeast Asia. He treats his team like family, showing them true affection — but only to them.

He despises the contradictory nature of humans. He believes that plundering, killing, and hating are human instincts, and that any good deed is usually done only for personal gain.

Because of this, he cannot stand hypocrites — people who act kind to strangers or appear virtuous, but avoid real responsibility and never get their hands dirty.

He particularly hates himself for chasing love, struggling, and trying to be kind. Deep down, he carries guilt for his younger self and for Noah, who died in his place. Perhaps this guilt is why he cannot bring himself to defeat Kim Daegun, who reminds him of those he wanted to forget. In Kim Daegun’s extreme hatred, he sees a part of himself that he had long tried to ignore.",5,1755465282.0,castlewebtoon,3,1.0,False

Even in a visibly clean space, there are all sorts of hidden trash items.. beer bottles and cans under the fallen leaves, broken glass pieces, plastic bags, coffee cups, wires, electronics, batteries etc..

She responded that it is inconvenient for her to go to the store and it is expensive and now she wont have coffee for the morning. my husband thinks I should give her a $10 gift card to go get the coffee she wants. I think in this price point ($120 for a night, that is going overboard. I like to do one extra thing, not lots. I already sourced dry firewood for the firepit since she wanted to have a fire in the summer.

Is it healthy to eat the same things each day, with variations to vegetables/sauces in those meals as long as it caps all my micronutrients? So far I'm eating this:

* Breakfast: Greek yogurt (120g), peanut butter (20g), honey (15g) and oat bran (30g). Instant coffee with a splash of milk.
* Pre-workout: 4 wholegrain crackers, two kiwi fruit and a scoop of [green juice powder](https://www.nuzest.co.nz/products/good-green-vitality).
* Post-workout: Oats (40g), 1 cup of water, blueberries (40g), peanut butter (20g), a banana and half a scoop of protein powder.
* Dinner: Chicken breast (150g) OR pink salmon (170g), peas (30g), chickpeas (80g), kidney beans (80g), baby spinach (40g), 1/3 shredded carrot, mixed nuts (30g), salsa (40g), wholegrain mustard (15g) and olive oil (10ml).
* 8PM Snack: 1.5 scoops protein powder, 1 cup of almond milk and oat bran (15g).

It's 2000 calories, 151g of protein, 165g of carbs, 73g of fat, 38g of fiber and caps out all vitamins/minerals within a healthy range. There are seasonings in my meals too, it's not all bland straight edged, but doesn't affect my totals enough to label them all.

If I swap out vegetables every every 3-4 days, have some miso soup here and there, enjoy a cheat meal on Friday/Sunday and change my dinner proteins to plant based once or twice a week, is it healthy for me to do for three to six months?

When trying to lose weight, what you eat before a workout plays a crucial role in fat burning and energy levels. [Best pre workout meal to lose weight](https://foodmuscl.com/best-pre-workout-meal-to-lose-weight/) can make a significant difference. A well-balanced pre-workout meal helps:

✅ Boost metabolism  
✅ Enhance fat oxidation (fat burning)  
✅ Prevent muscle loss  
✅ Provide sustained energy for exercise

# Key Nutrients for the Best Pre-Workout Meal to Lose Weight and Burn Fat

🥩 **Lean Protein (Build & Preserve Muscle)**

Protein is essential to prevent muscle loss and promote fat burning. It keeps you full and supports muscle recovery.

👉 **Best sources:**

* Greek yogurt
* [Egg whites](https://www.egginfo.co.uk/egg-nutrition-and-health/egg-nutrition-information/white-and-yolk/white)
* Chicken breast
* Cottage cheese
* Plant-based protein (tofu, lentils, chickpeas)

🍞 **Complex Carbohydrates (Sustained Energy)**

Carbs provide energy for workouts and help prevent muscle fatigue. However, refined carbs (like white bread) can cause blood sugar spikes, so opt for **slow-digesting complex carbs**.

👉 **Best sources:**

* Oatmeal
* Brown rice
* Quinoa
* Sweet potatoes
* Whole-grain bread

🥑 **Healthy Fats (Satiety & Endurance)**

Healthy fats help with sustained energy, especially for long-duration workouts. However, avoid high-fat meals right before exercise, as they take longer to digest.

👉 **Best sources:**

* Avocados
* Nuts (almonds, walnuts)
* Chia seeds & flaxseeds
* Nut butters (almond, peanut)

**Timing Your Pre-Workout Meal**

When you eat your pre-workout meal is just as important as what you eat!

⏳ **1-3 Hours Before Workout (Full Meal)**

* Ideal if you’re eating a full meal with carbs, protein, and healthy fats.
* Example: Grilled chicken with quinoa and steamed veggies.

⏳ **30-60 Minutes Before Workout (Quick Snack)**

* If you need a light snack, focus on **easily digestible protein and carbs**.
* Example: A banana with almond butter or a [protein](https://foodmuscl.com/foods-rich-in-protein-to-gain-weight/) smoothie.

**Best Pre-Workout Meal Ideas for Weight Loss**

🥣 **Oatmeal with Protein Powder & Chia Seeds**  
✔️ Provides slow-releasing energy + protein for muscle preservation.

🥑 **Scrambled Egg Whites with Avocado on Whole-Grain Toast**  
✔️ High in protein, fiber, and healthy fats for sustained energy.

🍌 **Banana with Almond Butter**  
✔️ A quick, balanced snack rich in potassium and natural sugars for energy.

🥛 **Greek Yogurt with Berries & Nuts**  
✔️ High in protein, probiotics for digestion, and [antioxidants](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/301506).

🍗 **Grilled Chicken with Quinoa & Steamed Broccoli**  
✔️ A full pre-workout meal rich in protein, fiber, and complex carbs.

🥤 **Protein Smoothie (Protein Powder + Banana + Spinach + Almond Milk)**  
✔️ A quick and easy meal to fuel your workout.

**Foods to Avoid Before a Workout**

🚫 **Sugary Foods & Drinks** Cause energy crashes (e.g., soda, candy, pastries).  
🚫 **High-Fat Meals** Slow digestion and make you feel sluggish (e.g., fried foods, fast food).  
🚫 **Carbonated Drinks** Cause bloating and discomfort.  
🚫 **Too Much Fiber** May cause stomach issues during exercise (e.g., beans, raw vegetables).

**Hydration: The Forgotten Key to Fat Burn**

**💧 Water is essential before workouts!** Dehydration can reduce performance and fat-burning efficiency.

✔️ **Drink 1-2 glasses of water 30 minutes before exercise.**  
✔️ **Best pre-workout drinks for weight loss:**

* **Green tea** (boosts metabolism)
* **Black coffee** (enhances fat oxidation)
* **Electrolyte water** (if sweating a lot)

To lose weight effectively, your **pre-workout meal should include lean protein, complex carbs, and a little healthy fat**. Timing matters—eat **1-3 hours before** for a full meal or **30-60 minutes before** for a light snack.

💡 **Best pick for weight loss?** Greek yogurt with berries & chia seeds or oatmeal with protein powder!

🔥 **Ready to burn fat? Fuel your body right and crush your workout!**

1mt2owa,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1mt2owa/follow_the_white_rabbit/,Follow the white rabbit.,"I used to think the worst part about teaching in the city was the indifference. The fights in the hallways, the drugs hidden in backpacks, the way parents barely showed up to parent–teacher conferences. But I was wrong. Indifference wasn’t the worst thing. It was only the beginning.

I teach English at Southridge High. The school is a cracked brick box that smells of mildew and mop water, tucked between a liquor store and a halfway house. My classroom windows don’t open, and the radiator rattles all winter long. Still, I loved it—or told myself I did. Teaching was my way of mattering in a city that devoured people whole.

The first disappearance was in October. A kid named Isaiah. Fourteen, wiry, sharp-eyed, and always wearing a hoodie no matter the weather. He sat in the back row and wrote these violent, beautiful poems about running through alleyways, blood on the concrete, monsters in human faces.

He didn’t show up one Monday. Then not on Tuesday. By Wednesday, I asked the office if he was sick. The secretary gave me this flat look, chewing her gum. “He transferred out,” she said.

“Transferred?” I asked. “Where?”

She shrugged. “Dunno. Family thing.”

That was it. No announcement. No parent call. No one asked. His desk was simply gone the next day.

A week later, it was Maribel. Seventeen, quiet, always sketching rabbits in the margins of her notebook. She’d leave them on my desk sometimes—black-eyed, long-eared things with human smiles. I thought it was quirky, even sweet. Then one Friday, she just wasn’t there.

“Transferred,” the secretary said again.

Transferred. Always the same word.

By November, six kids were gone.

I tried talking to the other teachers. In the breakroom, over stale coffee and burned bagels, I said, “Doesn’t it seem strange? How so many are leaving?”

They barely looked up from their phones. “Kids move all the time,” one said.

“Families relocate,” another mumbled.

But it was the way they said it—like their mouths knew the words but their eyes were hollow.

I started checking addresses in the school records, calling numbers. Dead lines. Voicemails with cheerful voices that never called back. A few houses I drove past, the windows were boarded up. Families gone. Not moved—erased.

And then there were the notes.

The first one slipped under my door during class. Folded neatly. Inside: Follow the White Rabbit.

I laughed nervously, thought it was some kid’s joke, a Matrix reference maybe. I threw it away. But the second note came the next day. Same words. The third arrived tucked inside a graded essay. Follow the White Rabbit.

By the fifth note, I couldn’t ignore it.

That night I dreamed of Isaiah. He stood at the foot of my bed, hoodie pulled low, face pale and slack. He didn’t blink. He just whispered, “The Rabbit knows.”

I woke up with claw marks on my sheets.

—

December turned bitter cold, and the vanishings spread. Fifteen students now. Always quiet removals, desks cleared out, names scrubbed from attendance lists as though they’d never existed. The strangest part was how no one cared. Parents didn’t come demanding answers. Police never visited. The school board never sent emails. It was like the world folded in on itself, smoothing over the missing with a perfect, uncaring hand.

But I cared. God help me, I cared.

One evening, grading papers alone, I heard scratching at my classroom door. Slow, dragging scratches, like claws over metal. I froze. “Hello?” My voice cracked.

Silence.

Then something slid under the door. Not a note. A drawing.

A rabbit. But not like Maribel’s sketches. This one was taller, its limbs long and bent at impossible angles. Its eyes were black voids. Its teeth stretched too far across its face. Beneath it: He is waiting.

I should have quit then. Should have packed up and left the city. But I couldn’t. These were my kids. And something was taking them.

—

It was the janitor, Mr. Alvarez, who finally broke the silence.

I caught him one night in the hallway, his mop abandoned, his eyes wet and frantic. He grabbed my sleeve. “You’re looking, aren’t you? For the missing?”

I nodded, my throat dry.

His voice shook. “Don’t. Don’t dig. Don’t follow. They chose him.”

“Who?” I asked.

He swallowed hard. His lips barely moved. “The White Rabbit.”

Before I could press him, he backed away, shaking his head, muttering prayers under his breath. The next morning, Alvarez didn’t show up to work. They said he’d retired.

Transferred, I thought.

—

The trail finally broke open in January. I was leaving school late when I saw Maribel. Or what used to be her. She stood across the street under a flickering streetlight. Her sketchbook dangled from her hand, pages fluttering in the wind.

“Maribel!” I called.

She lifted her head. Her face was wrong—her eyes stretched too wide, her mouth an empty O. She smiled, but her lips split at the corners, tearing upward like paper.

“Follow,” she rasped.

She turned and walked into the alley.

I don’t know why I followed. Maybe because I couldn’t let her disappear again. Maybe because some part of me already knew I’d been chosen too.

The alley stank of garbage and rot. At the end was a door I’d never noticed before. White paint peeled, a rabbit scrawled on it in what looked like rust—or blood.

The door opened on its own.

Inside was a stairwell leading down. Far down. The air grew damp, the walls narrowing, until I came to a room. A basement, but impossibly large.

And they were there. My students.

Dozens of them, standing in rows, eyes glazed, bodies twitching in unison like marionettes. Their mouths opened together, releasing a sound like static.

In the center stood the Rabbit.

He was tall, his body wrapped in a filthy white costume that clung like wet fur. His mask was a rabbit’s face stretched grotesque, eyes wide and black, teeth yellow and sharp. But the mask breathed. It pulsed with every inhale.

He turned to me.

“You care,” he said, voice muffled, distorted, like two people speaking at once. “That makes you mine.”

I couldn’t move. My legs rooted to the ground. He stepped closer, the air around him humming. The students’ heads all snapped toward me at once.

“Why?” I whispered.

“Because they listened,” he said. “Because they followed. And you will too.”

The students began chanting then, soft and broken. “Follow the White Rabbit. Follow the White Rabbit.” Over and over, their voices weaving into a hypnotic drone.

I bolted. Somehow my legs broke free, carrying me up the stairs, out the alley, into the freezing night. I didn’t stop running until I was home, my lungs tearing.

—

I tried to report it. Called the police, told them about the basement, the Rabbit. They laughed. One even said, “You teachers stress too much.”

When I returned the next day, the alley door was gone. A brick wall stood where it had been.

But the students kept disappearing.

—

Now it’s February. I don’t sleep much. When I do, I dream of rows of blank-eyed children chanting in the dark. I see the Rabbit’s teeth. I hear his breathing behind me when I walk home.

More notes appear on my desk each morning. The last one read: You’ve already followed. Now it’s time to stay.

I’m writing this because I don’t know how much longer I have. My class roster is nearly empty now. I try to teach to the few who remain, but even they stare at me strangely, as if waiting for something.

Last night, I saw Isaiah again. He stood outside my apartment window at 3 a.m., hood down, face pale and slack. His lips moved soundlessly, but I knew what he was saying.

Follow the White Rabbit.

I don’t know what’s real anymore. Maybe I’m losing my mind. Maybe I already followed too far. But one thing I do know—

The Rabbit is coming for me.

And this time, I don’t think I’ll run.

# Diary

# Sunday

7 a.m.: Despite my best intentions for a later start to the day, I wake up and can’t fall back asleep. After some phone time, I reluctantly get out of bed to brush my teeth and wash my face. My partner G got up before me and is cooking breakfast burritos. I make coffee, grab a burrito, and get settled on the couch for a little bit of reading and snuggling with Henri. My current nonfiction read is *The New Jim Crow* by Michelle Alexander (much more infuriating than expected, everything is bad) and for fiction I’m just starting S.A. Chakraborty’s *The City of Brass*. 

10 a.m.: I break the law (displace Louie from my lap) to get ready for the day. We’re meeting up with friends to bike to the anniversary celebration for the cycling group where most of us met. It’s obscenely humid, so I opt for a lightweight prAna shirt, padded cycling shorts, and bike shoes, and I throw chacos in my bag to change into while we’re sitting in the beer garden. 

11:30 a.m.: Although there was some miscommunication about meeting times, we rendezvous with our friends and arrive at the brewery before it’s slammed by the full group of cyclists. With the heat I’m not interested in beer, and I order two kombuchas on G’s tab, then grab some of the pizza provided for the event. A friend comes by soliciting donations to buy jerseys for people who want them but can’t justify the expense and I send her **$10.00**. 

2:00 p.m.: Our friends regroup to bike to a nearby bar and continue the celebration. I order a cocktail for G and a soda water for myself, totaling **$18.00** after tip. One friend buys another drink for G and then a round of shots for the group; we split the drink and a single shot because we still have to prepare for the week ahead. 

3:30 p.m.: G and I split off from the group to get groceries. Neither of us has much carrying capacity on the bikes we’re riding, but we stop at Trader Joe’s for the essentials to get us through Monday: yogurt and oat milk for breakfast and coffee, vegan meatballs to supplement the pasta ingredients we already have at home, and raspberry star shortbread cookies as a little treat. G and I use a spreadsheet to track our household spending and will settle up on groceries and other expenses at the end of the month; for now, my total is an even **$21.00**. 

Eventually I’d like to set up a shared account for household expenses including meals out and vacation (it feels silly when one of us venmos the other for our anniversary dinner) but we haven’t made that change yet. Once we do, we’ll keep individual accounts for discretionary spending because I don’t need to know what he spends on bike parts and I don’t think he wants to know what I spend on clothes–all of it is within our means, we just prioritize fun money differently. 

6:30 p.m.: G cooks a dinner of bowtie pasta with red sauce, kale, and the TJ’s meatballs while I shower and wash my hair. After we eat, we settle on the couch to continue our *Arrested Development* rewatch and neglect the chores we came home early to do. I’ve been on the hunt for loafers and dressy sandals, and have finally found a brand that makes comfortable shoes that don’t look like orthotics, so I take the plunge. With the promotional discount, my total is **$221.00**.

9:30 p.m.: Just as I’m thinking I’ll head up to bed, Louie cozies up in my lap. I am loath to disturb him and work on some online word puzzles. After an hour it feels like time to go, but he gets even more comfy by flipping onto his back with belly up, and he’s far too cute to even think about moving. I switch over to reading and around 11 he finally gets up and relocates. I head upstairs to brush and floss, do my skincare routine, and finish my current chapter before it’s finally time for lights out. 

Daily total: **$270**

# Monday

6:00 a.m.: I’m groggy when my alarm goes off, but since it’s a remote work day I don’t regret staying up late for kitty snuggles. I do my morning routine, throw on athletic shorts and G’s Sublime t-shirt, and head downstairs for coffee and breakfast. This morning I’m having yogurt and Aldi protein granola I bought last week, which is boring but easy. 

7:30 a.m.: I log on and deal with the emails I received while I was out of office on Friday. After I’ve made sure I’m current on my tasks, I use the YNAB loan payoff simulator to evaluate making another extra payment (I recently used a chunk of savings to help get the balance and lifetime interest down), and decide it wouldn’t affect interest enough to justify taking more out of savings. 

12 p.m.: On Saturday we made NYT’s gnocchi with burst cherry tomatoes (my sister kindly lets me use her subscription), which I reheat for leftovers although it’s much better fresh.

3:30 p.m.: Following a few afternoon meetings, my workday is done. I change for the gym and bike over for a deadlift and bench session, then stop by the grocery store for the items we skipped buying on Sunday: sweet potatoes and sauce for enchiladas, an onion and shredded mozzarella for tonight’s dinner, and some eggs. Total: **$26.53**

5:00 p.m.: G is doing bike maintenance in our garage when I get home; I decline his offer for help with dinner and when I open the fridge to unload groceries I’m confronted with the produce that’s gone bad despite my best intentions. I take them out to the compost, put away the fresh food, pour myself a drink from a growler I’m trying to get through before the beer goes flat, and start dinner. Tonight I’m making a double batch of one-pot farro from Pinch of Yum. I tweak it a little by sauteeing the onions before adding the other ingredients and throw in a can of chickpeas toward the end for extra protein. Because I love myself and G, while everything simmers I decide to dice and roast the sweet potatoes for tomorrow’s enchiladas. 

6:30 p.m.: G cleans up the kitchen after dinner, and I start food and logistics coordination for a group camping trip at the end of the month. One of the friends who’s joining texts me about ordering Kula cloths together. I send her my choice, then venmo her for the cloth and my part of shipping, totaling **$24.61**. I also shorten the camping reservation, which gives me a $150 refund that should show up in the next few days. 

9:00 p.m.: I want to find a two-player board/card game we both enjoy, but until then, tv is our usual evening activity. We watch an episode of *Dopesick* and then one of *Brooklyn 99* as a palate cleanser. G heads up to bed and I do my nighttime routine of shower, skincare, floss, brush, then read some more of *City of Brass* before lights out at 10:30. 

Daily total: **$51.14**

# Tuesday 

6:00 a.m.: My routine is the same as yesterday, except that I add protein powder to my yogurt because deadlifts made me extra hungry, and I’m headed to the office which means wearing real clothes and wearing some makeup (just mascara and eyebrow pencil for me). I choose a wine red sleeveless top and black wide-leg jeans, both of which I recently scored on Poshmark, and gold sneakers that are also a recent purchase. (Most of my discretionary spending has been on clothes lately, as I try to build up a wardrobe I love.) 

My shirt is a little wrinkled and we have neither an ironing board nor much interest in ironing; over breakfast, I confirm that I could get a clothing steamer and also use it to make our new, white bathroom floor extra-clean. I find one on Facebook Marketplace that’s just two miles away and message the seller about picking it up after work. 

7:00 a.m.: Somehow I again find myself running for the train even though I try to leave myself plenty of time to get there. Once I arrive at the office, I take a moment to submit a reimbursement request through my FSA for last week’s therapy appointment, and then start my workday. I could pay directly via FSA but as long as we’re stuck with this cursed system, I may as well get some credit card rewards for paying healthcare bills. 

12:00 p.m.: My office has a strong culture of having lunch together. I heat up leftover pasta and join my coworkers to eat and chat, covering some work topics and also questions like what we’d each do if we won the lottery. When I return to my desk, I work on some contract management tasks, send a few emails, attend a meeting, and prepare slides for presenting at a webinar next week. 

4:00 p.m.: I leave a little early to catch up with a former coworker over beers. He covers the tab, but because of our respective jobs I can’t technically accept gifts over $5. We agree I’ll buy a round or two for him in the future to balance it out. 

6:30 p.m.: I take the train and get home just as G is pulling our sweet potato black bean enchiladas out of the oven. We finish eating and the Facebook seller messages that she’s home. I bike over to pick up the clothing steamer. G and I split the cost and my half is **$10.00**. While I’m gone, G cleans up from dinner prep and puts away the leftovers. 

9:00 p.m.: I finish loading the day’s dishes in the dishwasher and we head upstairs to get ready for bed. I use my phone for too long and then read a little bit before lights out around 10:30.

# Wednesday

6:00 a.m.: Same routine as yesterday! Today’s outfit includes a plum button-down shirt, dark wash wide leg jeans, and the gold sneakers, though I wish the loafers had been delivered so I could wear those. The shirt is wrinkled and I’m delighted to use the steamer on it. It’s infinitely better than ironing and I wonder why it took me so long to make the investment. Getting ready for my commute feels too easy, and only after I get to the train platform (early, for once) do I realize I forgot to pack my lunch. I could go get it and take the next train, but I’m feeling lazy and opt to order out for lunch instead. 

7:45 a.m.: Today’s a light meeting day and my focus is reviewing footage to see if a recent project design change is improving safety as intended. I’ve been dreading the task because the footage is boring and there’s not a way to automate the effort. 

11:45 a.m.: I’d hoped to get a salad from the mini market at work, but all that’s available is sad gas station-style sandwiches. I order an egg sandwich with vegan sausage from a nearby bagel shop for **$13.17** including tax and tip. Today at lunch we discuss the ethics and impacts of generative AI–really light stuff! 

4:00 p.m.: I have to leave early again today, this time for the board meeting of a professional org I’m in. I derive great joy from cruising past stopped traffic when biking over. After the meeting, we walk to a nearby bar for a recruitment happy hour. My table orders deviled eggs and black eyed pea hummus to share, and I have a blackberry no-jito to drink. Food and NA beverages are covered by the org, so my total is $0. 

6:30 p.m.: Time to bike home! Yesterday my friend B texted from Costco to ask if we wanted anything while she was there and she’s dropping off the food shortly. My preferred protein bars were on sale (as a vegetarian I do ok with eating enough protein, but it’s nice to have some help), so she got two boxes, plus the cheese that we favor for our frequent quesadilla nights as well as pea crisps. We make plans to ride bikes on Saturday, and I venmo her for the food–the total is **$60.00**. After she leaves, I FaceTime my sister to help her pick outfits for the new job she starts next week, and eat a protein bar and a bowl of cereal because the happy hour snacks weren’t enough to replace dinner. 

8:30 p.m.: G got home while I was on FaceTime, and once I hang up we catch up on our days, then tidy up the kitchen and head upstairs for our nightly routine and lights out shortly after 10. 

Daily total: **$73.17** 

# Thursday

6:00 a.m.: The usual routine! Today I wear an orange, floral print linen dress and my new sandals, which are remarkably comfortable yet still cute, and pack Chacos in case it’s raining when I commute home. (My search for stylish shoes that I can wear on rainy summer days has been unsuccessful thus far.) I microwave a Costco bean & cheese burrito for breakfast and mishear G’s request for me to take one bin to the curb for pickup on my way out. I take all three (trash, recycling, compost) and get my hands dirty in the process, so I go back inside to wash my hands and am rather cranky with the situation. I end up once again running to catch the train, then text G to apologize for my attitude. One of my work friends texts me from the opposite end of the car I’m on, and we agree to walk from our ending station to the office together. 

7:45 a.m.: More footage to review today. While that’s playing on one screen, I check my budget on the other. My paycheck direct deposited and the monthly loan payment was processed. I use a chunk of the paycheck for a $1,250 payment on principal. I’m annoyed I didn’t do this on Tuesday, but at least the interest charge decreased by 40% from last month. After two hours of watching footage, it occurs to me that it’s an ideal activity to pair with an audiobook and resume listening to Souad Mekhennet’s *I Was Told to Come Alone.* 

12:00 p.m.: I remembered my lunch today: leftover enchiladas from Tuesday. At lunch we talk about early youtube memes and how weirdly wrong it feels to misgender pets even though they have no concept of gender identity. 

4:25 p.m.: I have a few afternoon meetings, then head to the train. Another colleague is on my train and we briefly catch up while walking home. I love that I see so many people I know when taking transit, and also appreciate that there’s mutual understanding that we won’t always talk while we’re on the train together. 

5:00 p.m.: G is going to a social bike ride tonight, but I’m tired and have been on the fence about joining all day. When it starts raining I take it as a sign to stay in and pour myself a glass of the growler beer in hopes of finishing it off before it goes flat. We’re having G’s college friend and his wife over for dinner tomorrow. They haven’t seen the house since helping us with move-in projects last January, so I do a little cleaning until it’s time to eat. 

6:00 p.m.: I heat up leftover farro for dinner and put on *Criminal Minds*, which has not held up since my obsession in high school. After one episode I switch to reading, and have a raspberry star cookie for dessert along with a shot glass of oat milk–G calls my mini-pours gremlin behavior–and then let Louie lick the glass as it’s one of his favorite treats. The glass goes in the dishwasher for sanitizing. I feel more energized and consider going to the gym, but reading on the couch wins out.

7:00 p.m.: G texts that he got a flat and forgot his repair kit, so he’s headed home early. We hang out for a bit and watch another episode of *Brooklyn 99*. While we watch, a friend who announced he’s running for local office this week sends his first fundraising email and I donate **$25.00**. 

9:00 p.m.: G heads up to bed and asks if I’m coming up, which motivates me to get ready for bed and read until I’m ready for sleep instead of staying downstairs to melt on the couch (a very bad habit of mine). I scroll reddit and read some more before lights out at 10:15. 

Daily total: **$1,275.00**

# Friday

6:00 a.m.: When my alarm goes off, it’s hot enough in the bedroom that I get up right away without any phone time. I do my morning routine plus shower and wash my hair, put on a tank top and athletic shorts for today’s remote work, and go downstairs. I’m feeling lazy and opt for iced coffee so I don’t have to bother with the French press, plus the last bit of yogurt and granola. 

7:00 a.m.: I log on and am annoyed when I remember I rescheduled a meeting to 2-2:45 today, which will make it harder to squeeze in everything I want to do before dinner. I work on emails and attend a couple of project coordination meetings. Each time I get up for water or snacks I knock out a little bit of tidying and dream of the day we can justify a cleaning service instead of using the money to deal with major house projects. 

11:25 a.m.: I’m caught up on tasks and decide that I’ll use PTO so I can work out in the two-hour break before my 2 p.m. call. I heat up more farro to eat during my 11:30 (off-camera) meeting, then change and bike the half mile to the gym–it is miserably swampy out–for a workout focused on squats and rows. 

1:30 p.m.: I have one email to reply to once I’m back at my desk, and am sad when my 2 p.m. meeting goes the full time it was scheduled. I submit my timesheet, then bike to the grocery store, hoping that I can get errands done before the forecasted thunderstorm rolls in. 

3:30 p.m.: G has already bought most of the ingredients to make banh mi for dinner tonight; I just grab two carrots, a daikon radish, baguettes, and frozen spring rolls, totaling **$24.54.** By the time I check out, it’s started to rain. I figure I can’t escape it at this point, and bike to my friend’s apartment to check on her cat Pimiento while hoping the baguettes stay dry in my bike bag. Within a few minutes, the sky completely opens up and I’m drenched. When I see a clogged storm drain, I figure the damage is done as far as being wet so I pull over to clear it, and knock out three more on my way to the apartment. I feed and pet Pimiento, but don’t stay long because I’m dripping all over the floor (luckily my friend has confirmed I don’t need to worry about drying the laminate). I clear another four storm drains after I leave and am deeply relieved when I get home and find the baguettes are unharmed by the rain. While I shower and find dry clothes, G hangs my wet clothes to dry and puts away the groceries. 

5:30 p.m.: Our friends arrive for dinner and bring freshly baked chocolate chip cookies for dessert. They admire the new bathroom and we hang out talking until nearly 10, then head upstairs to get ready for bed as soon as they leave. I read a few more chapters of *City of Brass* and go lights out around 11. 

Daily total: **$24.54**

# Saturday

7:00 a.m.: I’m once again annoyed to wake up early despite wanting to sleep in. G is up already, making pancakes for breakfast. I make coffee and settle on the couch to finish *City of Brass*. 

1:00 p.m.: I use last night’s leftovers to make a banh mi for lunch. I am again not in a big reading mood, so I get out my Switch and browse the Nintendo e-store for a new game. Tetris Effect, which my sister has been recommending for months, is on sale for $20 and I finally buy it–after tax, the total is **$21.79**. It’s taking long enough to download that I decide to bike over and check on Pimiento while I wait. Today I’m not soaked, which means I can actually hang out and I brush him for a bit before leaving. 

3:45 p.m.: I play Tetris Effect and find it much more stressful than anticipated. After an hour I switch to online window shopping for clothes and some compressible packing cubes that have caught my eye, but my money is all assigned to other things so I don’t buy anything. Around 5 I shower and pull on a lightweight shirt, athletic shorts, and chacos; I’m headed to B’s for a happy hour followed by a bike ride. G missed our group chat messages about it and thought the hang was just for me and her, so he made plans with other friends. 

5:45 p.m.: I arrive at B’s with yesterday’s chocolate chip cookies to share. She heats up cheddar and spinach pasta from Whole Foods for dinner and pours us rosé, and sets out trail mix and watermelon for snacks. Our friend K arrives later with chips and chocolate to share. We decide it’s too muggy to ride bikes and just chat and snack for a while. 

9:30 p.m.: B kicks us out, which I welcome because I’m feeling sleepy. I bike home and get back at the same time as G. He’s also tired and we head straight upstairs to get ready for bed, with lights out by 10:30.

# Reflection

I wrote a diary in August 2024 and my reflection noted that I didn’t feel good about my spending even though it was mostly reasonable, with a visit from a plumber, buying a new toilet, and getting a haircut. I mentioned in that post that a friend had suggested YNAB to help me feel better about my spending, and after almost a year of using it I can confirm she was correct–my retirement savings are in better shape and I feel good whether I’m buying new clothes, dining out, or spending on home improvement, because I’ve assigned money for all of those expenses and for savings. My emergency fund/liquid savings are lower just because I’m prioritizing the high-interest loan at the moment. 

I had also mentioned that I’d put off checking my retirement account because I was locked out after forgetting my password and didn’t want to call to have it reset. In June I began using a password manager, which has been a game changer; previously I would cycle through the same eight passwords with minor variations to meet different requirements and always forget which ones were on which accounts, and now I just need to remember the one password to the overall manager and can stay up to date on everything. 

For this year: I’m happy with how things went! The food and drink expenditures were standard, and G and I will settle up on groceries at the end of the month. Typically we'd dine out or order in together on Friday or Saturday, but last week we ordered out more, plus this weekend we were otherwise occupied, so things balanced out there. 

The shoes were expensive but a good investment and within my discretionary spending budget. I’m also excited to be on track to pay off the personal loan by the end of the year, then shift money toward extra payments on principal for the mortgage, plus beefing up the emergency fund with some specific sinking funds for things like home repair and eventually replacing some appliances. I’d obviously love to have those goals taken care of already (who doesn’t want more financial stability?) but am feeling good about where things stand. ",13,1755464874.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,1,0.93,False

1mt2nv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/DalhousieNB/comments/1mt2nv5/donalds_daycare_arseneault/,Donald’s Daycare (Arseneault),"
Last year in April, 12th 2024, an educator came to my business to let me know she had witnessed my son be assaulted physically and verbally by a educator there, she works in the 2 year old room. 
He has (I have all of them) 20 injury reports from this daycare in 1 year. 

The RCMP fumbled this entire thing, they never questioned anyone besides the owner despite educators and parents telling them that the owner Lisa Arseneault (former politician in town and related to Donald Arseneault)  was aware and would not do anything. Other educators had told Lisa and wound up being silenced, bullied at work and Lisa would not make reports of abuse to EECD. 
They also told us parents that the kids were too young to talk. Despite having a worker come forward and give them a list of names of former educators and people who witnessed what she saw but they still didn’t question these people (one being the educator that came forward July 2025) 
The RCMP never communicated with myself or my boyfriend about anything or the process. 

Flash forward to July 11th, 2025 and we have a second worker that came forward to the RCMP to make a statement of what she saw and it backs up what the first educator saw. Physical violence and verbal abuse. 
The officer kept asking all of us parents and educators “well, do you really want to report this, it’s not going to go Crown.”
We said yes we did. That we wanted to make our statements! 

If RCMP had questioned staff at Tic Tac Toe last year, then we wouldn’t be here. 

Then there’s also the tackling of the daycare inspectors that had multiple educators and parents who told the daycare inspectors, Mona Martin and Janelle Aube, what they saw/experienced and they did nothing. Kept no reports at all. 
All educators at TTT and others told me that Lisa the owner and Mona, the inspector will have some coffee, laugh, glance around and that’s it. That’s not a proper inspection!! 

The owner of the daycare Pierre Arsenault (Donald Arsenault’s brother. Our former MLA) and his wife Lisa are telling her friends in town which are other business owners, that we (parents and educators) are all “friends trying to do a smear campaign”. 
For what reason I have no idea. The parents and educators have injury reports, and there’s big changes in our kids. 

I’m beyond frustrated and this is a political family, related to Donald Arseneault. How am I supposed to take that? 
Educators are on statement too stating that Lisa Arsenault and Pierre do favors for people around them and make sure they’re insulated. 
There are also other mothers I’m in contact with who were silenced, disregarded, shunned by the town into silencing or behaving. 
This is victim abuse, gaslighting and really beyond disgusting. 
The system has massively dropped the ball!

She got me near the cafe and asked me if I wanted coffee. She took me upstairs and there the hookah costed ₹4500 but the menu didnt show the actual price, it only showed ₹299 for coal change. #Scam alert 3. (Leave when details dont match, immediately call the police!)

We ordered food and hookah and the bill came for ₹7500. They provided no bills. They just demanded payment and were extremely rude at it. She said she didnt know it costed that much and her UPI apparently didnt work for a dutch. I was taken to a dark corner and threatened to be beaten up, phone taken away and was kept there for half an hour till I agreed to pay the amount. I brought it down to ₹6000 but I was literally a hostage at that point. The owner will force you to call your friends and family for money. He called himself ""padha likha gunda"".

1mt2knk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mt2knk,Donald’s Daycare (Arseneault),"
Last year in April, 12th 2024, an educator came to my business to let me know she had witnessed my son be assaulted physically and verbally by a educator there, she works in the 2 year old room. 
He has (I have all of them) 20 injury reports from this daycare in 1 year. 

The RCMP fumbled this entire thing, they never questioned anyone besides the owner despite educators and parents telling them that the owner Lisa Arseneault (former politician in town and related to Donald Arseneault)  was aware and would not do anything. Other educators had told Lisa and wound up being silenced, bullied at work and Lisa would not make reports of abuse to EECD. 
They also told us parents that the kids were too young to talk. Despite having a worker come forward and give them a list of names of former educators and people who witnessed what she saw but they still didn’t question these people (one being the educator that came forward July 2025) 
The RCMP never communicated with myself or my boyfriend about anything or the process. 

Flash forward to July 11th, 2025 and we have a second worker that came forward to the RCMP to make a statement of what she saw and it backs up what the first educator saw. Physical violence and verbal abuse. 
The officer kept asking all of us parents and educators “well, do you really want to report this, it’s not going to go Crown.”
We said yes we did. That we wanted to make our statements! 

If RCMP had questioned staff at Tic Tac Toe last year, then we wouldn’t be here. 

Then there’s also the tackling of the daycare inspectors that had multiple educators and parents who told the daycare inspectors, Mona Martin and Janelle Aube, what they saw/experienced and they did nothing. Kept no reports at all. 
All educators at TTT and others told me that Lisa the owner and Mona, the inspector will have some coffee, laugh, glance around and that’s it. That’s not a proper inspection!! 

The owner of the daycare Pierre Arsenault (Donald Arsenault’s brother. Our former MLA) and his wife Lisa are telling her friends in town which are other business owners, that we (parents and educators) are all “friends trying to do a smear campaign”. 
For what reason I have no idea. The parents and educators have injury reports, and there’s big changes in our kids. 

I’m beyond frustrated and this is a political family, related to Donald Arseneault. How am I supposed to take that? 
Educators are on statement too stating that Lisa Arsenault and Pierre do favors for people around them and make sure they’re insulated. 
There are also other mothers I’m in contact with who were silenced, disregarded, shunned by the town into silencing or behaving. 
This is victim abuse, gaslighting and really beyond disgusting. 
The system has massively dropped the ball!

For the past few weeks, I’ve been feeling off after drinking my coffee. Dizzy, nauseous, sometimes my hands shake. I thought maybe it’s work stress or something I ate. But two days ago, I came home early and saw my wife in the kitchen, dropping some kind of powder into my coffee mug from a small, unmarked vial. It wasn’t sugar or creamer—it looked strange, like medicine or worse. When she saw me, she slipped the vial into her pocket and said it was “just a new coffee mix.” But her voice was shaky, and she wouldn’t look at me.

That evening, I asked her calmly to tell me what it was. She said it was a “natural supplement” to help me “feel better,” but she couldn’t say what it was or why there was no label. I got scared—those symptoms I’ve been having aren’t normal, and she’s never hidden things before. I told her I needed space to think and asked her to stay at her mom’s for a few days. She got upset, started crying, and said I was overreacting and breaking her trust. She left last night, and now she’s texting me, saying it was nothing harmful and I’m making a big deal out of it.

You wanna know what it's like to be a victim of Jeffrey Epstein's?

Virginia Giuffre: Hello, oh my goodness, like voice from the past.

Tara Palmeri: This is what it's like for Virginia Giuffre.

Virginia Giuffre: I wanted to talk to you about like some of the stuff that you might remember.

Tara Palmeri: She's still doing what she's been doing for nearly a decade. Trying to get some of the people who witnessed Epstein's massive sex trafficking operation to come forward and help her tell the world what happened.

Virginia Giuffre: Can I just come in and have like a cup of coffee with you? Would that be okay? What did he just say? Okay, so there's no, would you meet me somewhere for lunch? No. Okay. He hung up.

Speaker 3: Detectives arrive at Juliana Redding's house in Santa Monica, California. There was no pulse.

Speaker 4: We knew that it wasn't an accident.

Speaker 3: An alleged murder for hire. Fraud to the tune of $150 million.

Speaker 5: I need to see the doctor and I need to see the doctor right fricking now.

Speaker 3: Do what he says or else. From Sony Music Entertainment and Western Sound, this is ""Doctor's Orders,"" available now on the binge. Search for ""Doctor's Orders"" wherever you get your podcasts to start listening today.

Tara Palmeri: I'm Tara Palmeri, and this is season two of ""Broken,"" seeking justice. This might be weird to say as the host of a show about Jeffrey Epstein, but I don't really care about him. Here's what I care about. The people who he abused and who are now demanding something that seems so simple. They want our legal system and our society to say, very clearly, you don't get to sexually abuse girls for years and get away with it because you are rich and powerful. On this season of ""Broken,"" we're going to spend a lot of time with some of those victims, those survivors. Today, you'll hear about Virginia Giuffre. You've likely seen her on TV or in that photo of Prince Andrew with his arm around her bare teenage waist. In the years since she first told her story in 2011, Virginia has grown into a unique figure in our cultural landscape. A sex abuse victim who never stopped speaking out. And her willingness to relive and recount the awful things that happened to her and to keep the pressure on her alleged abusers has spurred real action. Her statements about being trafficked to Prince Andrew led him to step back from public life. This week, we go on a cross-country journey with Virginia, following her as she reaches out to some of the people she knew back when she was under Epstein's control. She wants the people who witnessed Epstein's sexual abuse operation to come forward and admit what they saw publicly. There's a lot of them.

Virginia Giuffre: Epstein had so many enablers in this sex trafficking operation.

Tara Palmeri: Virginia's particularly interested in Epstein's household employees, not the handful of assistants who actively ran the sex trafficking ring, their potential criminal defendants, and will probably never talk. But there are other staffers, people who didn't directly participate or organize the sex abuse, but were in a position to see so much.

Virginia Giuffre: Jeffrey had so many people, so many moving parts at every single one of his properties.

Tara Palmeri: The mansions in New York and Palm Beach, the island in the Caribbean, the ranch in New Mexico, these were people like butlers, maids, chauffeurs, and chefs, and then the pilots that would fly him from one house to another.

Virginia Giuffre: I don't know, at New York, he probably had about 15 house staff. All these employees, plus the guests, everybody who went into Jeffrey's house knew what was going on. You couldn't be a pizza delivery boy and walk in Epstein's houses and not know what's going on. You walk into the houses, naked pictures everywhere, young girls everywhere, old dude, not married. Like, it's not hard to just put two and two together, really.

Tara Palmeri: Virginia says most of the sexual abuse she endured occurred behind closed doors. But what she describes happening in the public areas would shock most people.

Virginia Giuffre: We would, you know, lay out completely naked, 100% naked. Jeffrey did not like tan lines at all. He wanted tan bodies, he wanted petite bodies, he wanted, like, prepubescent bodies, so no pubic hair

Tara Palmeri: and no tan lines. Virginia said she spent more than two years under Epstein's thumb, not only being forced to perform erotic massages nonstop, but helping him to do things that no able-bodied adult man should need assistance with. Like putting his socks and shoes on for him, soaping him in the shower, tucking him into bed. It was a horror show she only escaped in 2002 when she eloped with her now-husband.

Virginia Giuffre: I started this brand-new life in Australia. I learned how to cook eggs and do laundry. I know that sounds stupid, but, you know, like, I learned those little simple things in life, and that was... that's what made me happy, and I was so happy just to move on with that.

Tara Palmeri: But by 2011, Virginia realized she couldn't let Epstein's crimes go unpunished. She couldn't just move on.

Virginia Giuffre: What changed for me was giving birth to these beautiful children that I have and knowing a love that I've never known before.

Tara Palmeri: As you probably heard, Virginia has claimed in court filings that Epstein forced her to have sex with a number of powerful men, all of whom denied it, including the lawyer Alan Dershowitz, Prince Andrew, former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, and former Senator George Mitchell. In her mind, these were all public figures, not paying any price for their actions. She felt a need to call them to account. She didn't think getting justice would take all that long. Epstein ran a massive sex trafficking operation in which he and allegedly many men and a handful of women sexually abused dozens, probably hundreds, of girls. She thought the evidence she gave would be enough to lock them up. But for years, she saw such meager progress. How could it be that nobody cared about Epstein's crimes?

Virginia Giuffre: Justice isn't just people going to jail. I think justice to me looks like we need to change the system.

Tara Palmeri: Then our own Julie K. Brown wrote her explosive series in the Miami Herald, and the world finally agreed with her. This is horrible. Something must be done. And a few things were. Epstein was arrested, of course, but he died in custody. Alex Acosta, the former U.S. attorney, who struck an absurdly lenient deal with Epstein back in 2007, lost his Cabinet post. Ghislaine Maxwell was indicted on charges, all of which she denies, related to her role in Epstein's abuse of underage girls. Prince Andrew had to step back from his public duties, though it's easy to find a regular stream of pap shots of his very lovely life. But what about the other people who enabled and participated in Epstein's crimes?

Virginia Giuffre: I pray I wish that the truth comes out about everybody who participated, enabled, and watched Epstein and Maxwell get away with trafficking so many of us minors. They've been getting away with it for decades.

Tara Palmeri: So Virginia asked us to help her. She said she wants to reach out to some of those staffers, those people she knew back then, the people who witnessed Epstein's operation in action. She wants them to talk, now. She needs them for specific legal reasons. She's embroiled in two lawsuits, and she hopes they can help her out. And she needs them for other, more personal reasons. She wants what many victims of abuse want, someone to acknowledge that what she went through really happened. The first stop on our journey is in Los Angeles. Virginia flew there from Australia, and I came from New York with my producer, Krista. We came here to meet one man who was at the top of Virginia's list. In 2014, when she was preparing for a previous lawsuit, Virginia talked with her lawyer about who might be able to confirm the basics of her story. She immediately thought of one guy.

Virginia Giuffre: So I made really good friends with this guy named Adam Perry Lang. Adam Perry Lang. He was Jeffrey's personal chef for quite a long time. So Adam went nearly everywhere with us. I think he was there almost all the time. He used to talk to me like I was a person, even if I was standing naked in front of him, he wouldn't be there ogling me with his eyes. He would just be like looking directly at my face. And we had wonderful moments together.

Tara Palmeri: When Virginia wants to convey what it's like to live under Epstein and Maxwell, she doesn't talk that much about the abuse. She talks about the food.

Virginia Giuffre: So Jeffrey had us on like these ridiculous diets, right? It was all organic and it was all like, you know, shaved salmon on a bed of pilaf or couscous and you know, your vegetables. It was never like carbs. You can't just fill up. They wanted you to look a specific way.

Tara Palmeri: Back then, most days she had to put Epstein to bed, which she says meant being sexually abused one more time, then finally tucking him in.

Virginia Giuffre: I could close the door and then I could just go like and breathe.

Tara Palmeri: She remembers one night on Epstein's private island back when she and Adam Perry Lang were both on the payroll.

Virginia Giuffre: I went to the kitchen to go get something and I was starving and I was like, ""Adam, could you whip me up something?"" He's like, ""Yeah, what do you like?"" And I was like, ""I love pizza."" It's like, ""I can make really good pizzas."" So that was like the first time and then it just became like a normal thing where I didn't even have to ask for it anymore.

Tara Palmeri: Virginia's routine became familiar. She would go upstairs and put Epstein to bed and then go back downstairs to the kitchen and Adam.

Virginia Giuffre: And he would have the pizza waiting for me already in the kitchen. I'd jump up on the bench. We'd open a beer, which is another thing we weren't allowed to drink, but we would have a beer together and eat pizza and just talk. Sometimes I'd help him wash dishes. He just seems like a real cool human being.

Tara Palmeri: Her time with Adam was exciting because it was a small act of rebellion against the strict rules she was living under.

Virginia Giuffre: Ghislaine found out once that he was doing that and we both got reprimanded. Ghislaine being the control freak that she was, was like keeping an eye on us, making sure that we weren't talking anymore.

Tara Palmeri: Lang worked for Epstein from 1999 to 2003. Since then, he's become a celebrity chef in LA, famous especially for his barbecue.

Speaker 6: Okay, who's ready to kick off the next challenge? Please welcome barbecue master,

Virginia Giuffre: Adam Perry Lang.

Tara Palmeri: Celebrities hang out at his restaurant called APL after his initials. Lang has become Jimmy Kimmel's best friend.

Speaker 7: We met Adam was a chef on my show. He barbecued a whole pig in our parking lot.

Krista Hauser: And the rest is

Tara Palmeri: LA foodie history. He's also been on Kimmel's show a bunch.

Speaker 7: I'll tell you from personal experience that our next guest really knows how to handle a piece of meat. Tonight, he's here to make your holiday feast, even feastier. Please welcome barbecue chef, Adam Perry Lang.

Tara Palmeri: Adam, come on. Lang has written several popular books about barbecue. A big part of his narrative, the story he tells about himself, is that he was a late convert to the art. Here's Oprah.

Speaker 9: Adam Perry Lang is the man behind the meat. A classically trained chef, Adam fell in love with barbecue while working as a cook on a New Mexico ranch.

Tara Palmeri: Lang doesn't mention that the New Mexico ranch was Jeffrey Epstein's. Last year, the New York Times reported on something very weird about that ranch. It says that starting in the early 2000s, when Lang was working there, Epstein would talk sometimes at his dinner parties about his plan to use that ranch as a literal breeding ground. He wanted to inseminate large numbers of girls and women with his sperm in order to seed the human race with his own DNA. Lang often mentions the ranch in interviews.

Speaker 10: And over there, there was like a lot of displaced Texas ranch hands and cowboys there. And on the downtime, they do barbecue. And they like totally pulled me into it.

Tara Palmeri: It's a great story and Lang loves to tell it. He was a sophisticated chef working with the finest restaurants in New York and Paris, but finds his true calling on a simple ranch in New Mexico alongside authentic cowboys. But this is not a story about barbecue. Epstein had that large staff, though chauffeurs and pilots, butlers and maids. But...

[... content truncated as in original ...]

Tara Palmeri: So knowing this, we tried to get in touch with Lang one last time. We showed up at the one place we knew he might be, his restaurant, APL. APL is on Hollywood and Vine. We had heard it was a celebrity hotspot, but wow. When we walked in, it was packed with famous people, more celebrities than us mortals. This place is co-owned by Jimmy Kimmel and Joel McHale, the star of Community. McHale walked in right as we did and sat with a bunch of comedians. It's frequently used for Hollywood parties. It's right down the block from many of LA's big movie theaters that show premieres and APL has this perfect private room with a big glass wall. So the celebrities can be seen, but also have some privacy. We sat at a big booth in the back of the dining room. Virginia had dressed up for the evening in a soft gray coat and heels. The menu was unsurprisingly full of meat.

Virginia Giuffre: What do you recommend here? What's your favorite dish? So I'm gonna get the $160 one right there.

Tara Palmeri: When we made the reservation, we put in a note asking to see the chef. When we arrived, Virginia told the host that she's an old friend of Adam's and would love to say hi. The host said that Adam often stops by. We waited, anxious, hopeful. We ate, we ordered dessert. We waited. We watched all those celebrities leave, waited some more.

Virginia Giuffre: Well, that's kind of like what I wrote to Adam in here, you know, and I tried to express to him that, you know, Epstein's gone. Oops, sorry. Epstein's. Well, Epstein's gone. And, you know, we don't have to be afraid. I wanted to give him that leverage of like, you know, that's what was holding you back. Kind of like help him build his own narrative. So he doesn't come out looking like the bad guy and give him the opportunity to do right by us this time. So yeah, I think we could leave this for him.

Tara Palmeri: It's just a letter like. Virginia was sitting at the head of the table, holding that note she wrote for Lang. And every time someone came in, she turned her head. We all turned our head to see if it was Lang. Finally, the waiter said Lang wouldn't be coming in. Virginia was deflated. We left word telling him who Virginia is and asking Lang to reach out. At this point, we knew Lang had to be getting our messages between voicemails, the emails, the restaurant staff. We knew that he was ignoring Virginia. But then a few days later, Virginia received a text. All right, we just got a text message from Adam Perry Lang and let's read it.

Virginia Giuffre: Adam Perry Lang is saying, ""Hi, Virginia. I know this has been a traumatic and terrible time for you. I hope your fierce advocacy brings you and the other innocent victims peace and justice. I hope you know by now that I'm planning to speak with your attorney, best Adam.""

That makes my entire day worth all the canvassing that we've done, everywhere we've gone, all the doors being slammed in our face. This makes it worth it. I mean, we've actually touched another person's life to the point where they actually want to help now. So this is great. I mean, regardless of anything came out of it, he's talking to the attorneys. And that means he's gonna sit down for an affidavit and under oath, tell my attorneys who was there, what he saw, and try to be of any help. And that's all we can ask from people. If you saw something, say something.

Tara Palmeri: That was seven months ago. After that text, Lang stopped talking with her and communicated through lawyers. Lang declined our many requests for an interview and would not answer any of the specific questions we sent. His lawyer did say he was in touch with federal prosecutors in New York and was cooperating fully with their investigation. He also sent us a statement. I have profound sympathy and admiration for the brave women who have come forward and made public Jeffrey Epstein's heinous crimes. I understand the interest in the time I spent working as a chef for Jeffrey Epstein, and I'm working with the lawyers representing Virginia Giuffre to provide whatever assistance I can. It pains me that I cannot provide the confirmation that you seek here, but I cannot attest to what I did not witness or cannot recall. That said, I want to be clear that I never saw sexual activity or nudity and was never aware of underage girls. I was never told of nor saw any of the depraved acts committed by Epstein and his friends. I primarily spent my time in the kitchen. Any account other than this is emphatically untrue. We should note, we'll say it right now to Adam Perry Lang. We would love to hear your story. For that matter, we'd like to hear from anyone who has information about Epstein. You can email us at broken at threeuncannyfour.com.

(Somber Music)

Virginia hadn't taken a 17-hour flight to the U.S. to stop there. There were other potential witnesses she wanted to talk to. So we left Los Angeles and flew to Florida, where two other key people live.

Speaker 5: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to West Palm Beach for the love of time.

Tara Palmeri: The first address we drove to was in Palm Beach Gardens, 20 minutes north of Palm Beach. I was driving with Virginia riding shotgun, and my producer, Krista, was in the back seat.

Speaker 6: So we're on our way to see Larry,

Virginia Giuffre: is it Visotsky? Is that how you say his name? Yep.

Speaker 4: What is that?

Virginia Giuffre: Larry Visotsky. We're on our way to Jeffrey's main pilot. So the guy who would sign everybody in on every flight, Larry Visotsky holds the treasure in his hands.

Tara Palmeri: That treasure is paper, the flight logs. Some flight logs are out in the public now. That's part of how Adam Perry Lang was connected to Epstein. But those are from a different pilot, David Rodgers. Those logs have some of the most valuable documentary evidence we have of who spent time with Epstein. We can see which men were on flights with him alongside girls like Virginia. Visotsky has never spoken publicly about his time with Epstein. He was deposed in a legal case in 2008, but his testimony was, according to Virginia's lawyer, useless. According to the lawyer, he was evasive and seemed not to remember much. For Virginia and the many lawyers representing victims, probably the single most valuable bit of information would be Visotsky's flight logs. It has been frustrating finding out what became of them. His attorney told us Visotsky had cooperated fully with authorities. It's not clear what has become of his flight logs, which could likely contribute greatly to our understanding of Epstein's operation.

Virginia Giuffre: Larry Visotsky has a wealth of knowledge, but this is why Jeffrey treated him so well, because Larry Visotsky always kept his mouth shut.

Tara Palmeri: Epstein was very generous with Larry Visotsky. He received a gift of land on the New Mexico Ranch, and he even visited Epstein during his brief incarceration. Virginia remembers Visotsky fondly. On her very first flight with Epstein when she was underage, Visotsky let her sit up by the pilots during takeoff. She remembers it being like a roller coaster, a source close to Larry told us that Larry remembers meeting Virginia, but that he didn't remember letting Virginia into the cockpit area, and he didn't know she was a minor. He didn't recall seeing any unaccompanied minors aboard Epstein's planes. Larry's home was in a gated community, like a lot of Florida, but this one was all mini-mansions and water features. There was an attendant at the gate, and we gave him Larry's name.

Virginia Giuffre: Could you also tell him Virginia Giuffre?

Tara Palmeri: The attendant called Larry and actually had him on the phone. So Virginia put the receiver up to her ear.

Virginia Giuffre: Hello, is this Larry? Hi, Larry, oh my goodness, like voice from the past, almost like ghost from the past. This is Virginia Giuffre. So I used to fly on the plane all the time with you guys. You remember the first time like you guys put me in the cockpit and with you and David, and I was like, this is like a roller coaster, and it was so much fun from Florida to New York. And anyways, I'm here with reporter Tara Palmeri, and we're just, we're going on like this mission, and I wanted to talk to you about like some of the stuff that you might remember, but I just remember you as this like super cool guy. So we're just kind of like putting together the pieces of this puzzle, because there's a lot of people who wouldn't talk while Epstein was alive. But now that he's gone, I feel like we can kind of put together a lot of this missing info, and especially like you're super important, Larry, because you have the black and white evidence, like the flight logs, you know, David was cool enough to hand his over. Okay. Can I just come in and have like a cup of coffee with you? Would that be okay? Okay, so there's no, would you meet me somewhere for lunch? No.

Speaker 12: Okay.

Tara Palmeri: He hung up. In a statement given through his attorney, Larry said he has been fully cooperative with all requests from law enforcement and remains ready to assist further in any way that he can. He still hasn't made any public show of support to Virginia. The last stop on our journey was the one we had the least hope for. We went to the house of Juan Alessi, Epstein's former chauffeur and all around house man. Just like Larry, Juan has been particularly resistant to talking publicly. He had never given an interview to the media. So with little hope, we rang the buzzer. And we got an answer.

Virginia Giuffre: Hi, Juan. It's Virginia. Virginia Giuffre from like 20 years ago. How are you?

Tara Palmeri: Juan had answered the intercom and he was actually talking to Virginia.

Virginia Giuffre: I've flown all the way from Australia to try to put together the pieces of my past. Like there's been a whole bunch of like bad stuff happening and you know, it wasn't just Epstein who did what he did. So I was gonna ask you, is it okay if I come in to your property and meet with you and Maria.

Tara Palmeri: He seems surprised to hear from her. But when he realized that Virginia was at his front gate, he buzzes both in.

Oh, thank you so much.

Virginia Giuffre: Okay, we're on our way. Okay. Thank you.

Speaker 6: It's just a crazy story, but it's even crazier when you're watching the government confer with the person who abused me.

Speaker 4: She was a pawn as far as I'm concerned.

Speaker 13: You don't ask questions. You just stay out of the way. It was literally like Alice in Wonderland. You're like falling through the rabbit hole as soon as you got in that door.

Virginia Giuffre: And I heard her voice, and I knew exactly who it was.

1mt2hec,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugAndProof/comments/1mt2hec/explore_the_best_coffee_machine_xbloom_studio_and/,Explore the best coffee machine xBloom Studio and is it worth it,"The xBloom FW-02A-01 Studio coffee machine caught my attention with its sleek Midnight Black finish and promise of transforming the daily coffee-making routine into an artisan experience. After testing it for several weeks, I’ve had ample opportunity to dive into its features, experiment with its functionality, and uncover both its merits and quirks. While the product boasts impressive features for coffee enthusiasts, there are details potential buyers might want to consider before splurging on this barista-grade appliance.

**Exceptional Design and Build Quality**

Aesthetics and practicality blend beautifully in the minimalist and modern appeal of this coffee maker. The matte exterior finish is not just visually pleasing but also resistant to fingerprints, which helps maintain its polished look over time. Its compact dimensions (8"" x 6.7"" x 14.75"") mean it fits well even in modest kitchen spaces while still feeling sturdy and well-constructed at 11.3 pounds. The design isn’t just about looks; its smart layout ensures every button, knob, and port is intuitively positioned. The magnetic dosing cup is a small detail, yet it feels incredibly premium and adds a sense of precision to the overall coffee-making process.

**Innovative Features at Every Turn**

The standout feature for me is the 3 levels of automation: Autopilot, Copilot, and Freesolo. These modes provide a balance between guided brewing and complete creative control. When I’m short on time, the Autopilot makes mornings effortless by automating almost everything. On lazy Sunday mornings, I can switch to Freesolo mode and dive headfirst into crafting a personalized brew. The tactile knobs and LED matrix are intuitive to use and lend a modern edge to the interaction.

[Check xBloom FW-02A-01 Studio price on Amazon.](https://applegreenshop.com/p/b0dkkly1v9/)

**Immersive App Integration**

The xBloom app adds another layer of sophistication, allowing users to save and adjust recipes with a simple tap. I love how easy it was to fine-tune my favorite Americano recipe. Sharing those recipes with friends who also have the machine is a surprising yet delightful bonus feature. While the app didn’t have any glitches during testing, I did notice reviews mentioning occasional connectivity issues. Thankfully, I never encountered such problems, but it’s worth keeping in mind if smartphone integration is a dealbreaker for you.

**xPods: A Sustainable, Convenient Twist**

The inclusion of xPods feels both forward-thinking and practical. Made with compostable materials, these pods house choice whole beans and a built-in filter, making brewing a “tap and go” affair. While it reduces waste and eliminates the need for extra equipment, I did find that xPods are proprietary, which might limit flexibility for those who prefer experimenting with beans from different roasters. However, for casual users who want convenience without compromising on flavor, these are a fantastic addition.

**Key Benefits**

- Customizable automation modes offer flexibility for different skill levels.  
- Integrated grinder and scale create a seamless experience.  
- App-controlled functionality enhances convenience.  
- Sustainable and innovative xPods improve eco-friendliness.  

**Potential Shortcomings**

- Proprietary xPods might limit customization for adventurous coffee consumers.  
- The 11.3-pound machine may not be as portable for shared spaces.  
- App-dependent functionality may not suit tech-averse users.  

**Other Options in the Market**

When considering alternatives, machines like the Breville Barista Express and Technivorm Moccamaster come to mind. The Breville model excels in user-controlled grinding and steaming milk, making it ideal for latte lovers. Technivorm's simple, durable design paired with consistent temperature control has earned a loyal following among traditionalists. However, neither competitor matches xBloom’s elegant mix of automation and artisan-level freedom, nor does their sustainability effort with proprietary pods come close to xBloom’s eco-conscious xPods. On the downside, xBloom lags in heat consistency compared to Technivorm and lacks the robust frothing capabilities of the Breville units.

**Quality for Price**

While the initial sticker shock might give some pause, the thoughtful combination of features and its ease of use justifies the investment for coffee aficionados. The ability to scale from beginner to expert modes means it caters to a variety of coffee-making experience levels, ensuring there’s lasting value in the purchase. What truly gives this machine an edge is its elegant design paired with functionalities that make brewing both intuitive and creative. Budget-conscious buyers may need to weigh the premium price against their coffee-drinking habits, but for those prioritizing precision and automation, the cost feels well-aligned with its value.

1mt2esv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1mt2esv/got_discarded_feeling_lucky/,"Got discarded, feeling lucky","I went on a date with this girl recently who I got to know through friends but was quite eager to meet up with me and even planned the date out etc, I really had to do nothing. This already seemed a bit off because usually the women I dated preferred if the man handled the first few dates and was the ""pursuer"". This was completely reversed. The date went pretty great we had coffee and went for a walk, spent a few hours together. After this she texted me how much fun she had and how she would really like me to call her sometime, because she was going away on vacation.

This had me feeling pretty good, she mentioned that her ex treated her a bit poorly and had anger issues which is why she wanted to take the relationship a bit slower next time she gets to someone. Maybe a bit much to say on the first date, but I took it more as a sign that she deemed me trustworthy. In general I tend to trust people a lot if I like them and I thought nothing too bad about it, often people end up in bad relationships and it's hard to leave.

Two days later I proceeded to ask her if she wants to talk a bit on the phone and we ended talking for 2 hours on end. This kind of started this thing of calling daily but I enjoyed it she had this fun energy to her and was also really cute. Funnily I knew slightly what BPD was because I tried to self diagnose myself with it a few years back and some of her behaviours kind of signalled this to me, but I didn't really know how serious this disorder was before actually looking up what it does with people.

During the time we talked on the phone there weren't that many serious red flags besides that she didn't have the best relationship with her family, but neither do I so I kind of brushed it off. We just talked about what we did during the day and other small topics, she sent me lots of pictures and we just had a fun talking phase. After a while she told me that she was in a mental institution for a while for depression a few years back and that's why she still has SH marks and covers them up so that I'm not surprised when I see them and was ""jokingly"" worried that I'll ghost her for it. I didn't really have a reason to question the fact that those were indeed from depression and not from another disorder and she told me that she's long healed that so it was fine for me too really. Otherwise we just talked a lot and I had quite a good time because this time of year is usually pretty lonely for me due to being busy with uni work so it was pretty nice to have someone to chat to in the evening.

After she came back we had this weird date in her hometown where all of a sudden she was really paranoid that her ex might see us and do something to her to the point where she was sobbing, basically we were only talking about her ex there and she was also distressed about me being ""too good"" to her. She wasn't feeling well anyways so I kind of comforted her and we just packed up our stuff and I left early. Before I left she also gave me a gift she bought for me which was nice. She apologised later over text and told me that this situation with her ex bf was still a bit of an issue. I was a bit confused by this whole situation so I told her that I liked her a lot but I won't be her therapist in regards to her ex bf and also to consider if she's really over him because for me it didn't really seem normal that he was so strongly on her mind despite him having broken up with her twice almost a year ago. Despite the guy being abusive she was weirdly defensive over him too, which isn't completely unusual behaviour but at the same time a bit strange to me.

Suddenly she stopped responding completely (usually she responded within seconds when we texted) and texted me a few hours later with a weird unstructured text that she needs to think and that she already told me that she's over him. No response for two days, so I reached out to her with a bit of an apologetic tone to which she texted me that she's sorry but she doesn't have any feelings towards me and never had and I'm really nice and she's sure that I'll meet someone great. After which she removed me from her socials and just kind of disappeared.

I was a bit taken aback by this, texted a friend of mine talked a bit, felt a bit bad and was wondering if I did something wrong by being maybe a bit too harsh with the message after meeting her the 2nd time, at the same time talking only about her ex bf while meeting with me was in my mind quite disrespectful. In the same week I had an appointment scheduled with my psychiatrist because I take ADHD meds and I have to check in with him once in a while. I told him this story and that I was a bit puzzled by it, to which he told me that maybe I should consider myself very lucky. That he can't diagnose someone else who isn't his patient, but from the behaviour she seemed to him like a pretty obvious case of BPD and explained the whole FP dynamic, idealising, devaluing and discarding.

After reading up the stories online about BPD relationships I found an eerie similarity to what I experienced, but for me it ended really quickly compared to others. Especially reading about the relationships that went on for multiple years made me really uncomfortable and felt life ruining. Having read all those stories all of a sudden I saw a lot of the red flags that I haven't been aware of in the beginning. I knew about this disorder theoretically but never saw it manifest in someone, although I suspect that my ex in high school also might have suffered from it. But all red flags people talk about were there:

\* Lovebombing

\* Early talking about being in a relationship and the things we would do then

\* Fear of me leaving from the very beginning (I thought she was joking when she said things like this but I think it was more serious than I thought)

\* Apologizing to me over being upset at things I didn't think caused an argument in the first place, often over very mild jokes I made which seem to have upset her

\* Impulsive behaviour, mentioning getting coverups of tattoos quite fast after having them done originally, history of drug use

\* Spending a lot of money on clothes, likes to gamble

\* Bad relationship with family

\* No ""long term"" friends (all the close friends she has are people she met around a year ago), kind of mean to them?

\* SH Marks, history of mental disorders

\* Crazy exes, talks a lot about them

\* Very jealous, checked my followers on IG and was upset that I follow a lot of women (I don't really think that's the case, I only follow people I know and maybe 50% of those people are women)

\* Sudden 180 change of tone and ""discard"" while a few hours before everything was seemingly fine

Thing is for all of those things individually I always could come up with an excuse, mainly because I wasn't really trying to use those things to put her in a bad light. Drugs are fun, who doesn't like them, ah yeah we all have issues with our family sometimes, yeah gambling is fun I was also addicted to sports betting once, yeah we all have issues I think I was also depressed at some point etc etc.

In the beginning I was kind of hoping that she'd come around because people with BPD seem to have this tendency, but yea after having read those stories on here I'm no way in hell getting back into that because it feels like I seem to have gotten the ""good"" part before it went sour and I'd rather not put up with the rest. I feel like I got a life lesson for almost free and maybe should work a bit on my boundaries and codependent tendencies, although I think that up to this point I didn't necessarily give more than I received out of this brief time of knowing her.",2,1755464237.0,BPDlovedones,5,1.0,False

You favourite yapper is back to talk about Sasazuka's route! Little reminder that this review will contain spoilers about the whole route, including bad endings so don't read further if you'd like to avoid those. Also, I'm following otomekitten's recommended route order (Enomoto>Okazaki>Sasazuka>Shiraishi>Yanagi) so please do not spoil the last two routes, we'll discuss them very soon anyway.

  
Sasazuka - 「復讐」(tl: revenge)

I would like to preface this by saying that I take notes on my phone's notes app as I play the routes whenever there's something I'd like to remember for these reviews. For Enomoto and Okazaki, I had about a page worth of notes. I have 4 for Sasazuka. This is going to be a long (and hopefully fun) ride.

Now, you guys know I pretty much hated Sasazuka from the get go, we didn't exactly start off on the best note him and I. As I speak now having finished his route, I have a slight dislike of him, which means there's things about the route I really like. However, it was just not enough for me to overcome my dislike of him, partly because of how things are framed in this route as well. I'll go over everything, and please let me know in the comments if you agree/disagree and why, I'm always happy to read what you guys thought!

My issues with this route are not really overall plot related (though I'll mention some small stuff on that), it has more to do with Sasazuka as a character and how Ichika's characterised in relation to him.

If you don't know me yet, I'm not a fan of tsunderes in general. I tend to value direct communication and mindfulness in relationships so tsunderes feel childish to me a lot of the time. Still, there's some I've been able to enjoy in other games (Ryuki in Cupid Parasite or Shin in Amnesia for example) so I give all LIs their shot (I'm also a completionist so I don't typically skip routes). To me, and this is really just my personal opinion here, a tsundere gets enjoyable once he overcomes that ""tsun"" part. Unfortunately, that never happens with Sasazuka. From the beginning to the end of the route, he's rude and demeaning to Ichika. It's not just something he does when he hasn't acknowledged her yet, he keeps doing it, it's Ichika that has to get over it. The only moments she stands up to him is to beg him to take her as a partner. The game tells you that Ichika is dumb and you have to just accept it. He calls her fat and dumb and animal names and she just has to get over it because ""he didn't mean it"". Well, I consider that an adult, especially someone as intelligent as him, should know to be mindful of his words. They excuse that behaviour by him living in America, which is hilarious but so stupid. I'm not American, and as a European making fun of Americans is my God-given right, however let's not act like this is an American thing. I have plenty of American friends, they understand what being polite and considerate of others means. This doesn't excuse his behaviour.  
Arguably, he's also very misogynistic. He constantly cuts conversations short when he feels like it, makes her do chores, tells her she's just ""oversensitive"" when she complains about his insensitive remarks (side note but men doing that makes me want to kill on sight), is pushy with her drinking in that one scene, and none of this is adressed. She just falls in love with him somehow and is okay with it I guess.  His whole ""my woman"" thing is also off-putting in this regard.  
I wouldn't have a problem with it if this were just a starting point and Ichika stood up for herself but she never does and he never changes. She's not his partner, not at any point, she just brings him coffee and donuts like it's the 60s.  
Now, I didn't dislike everything. I really really like the VA's work, I also found it hilarious when he immediately said ""No"" after Ichika said she'd work on the August cases. He is funny at times and I like LIs who are a tease, I just dislike disrespect lol. I enjoyed the scene where Ichika breaks down in Kazuki's room, he was sweet there. The body pillow scene with his bonus kiss was also really cute, I enjoyed that. I like that he's proactive with some of the dating stuff, like the kiss. I also have to admit it, blushing Sasazuka is babygirl-coded, I don't make the rules, he just is. 😌 But none of it outweighs the bad to me. He also doesn't get along with Kazuki, he gotta go 😂  
Now, for full transparency, there's also a few personal preferences that shape my opinion of him. For example, his design makes him seem younger (though he isn't) and that probably makes me like him less as a romantic prospect. I also tend to like physical or verbal displays of affection more and I find his route lacking in that (especially words of affirmation) so the romance felt a bit underwhelming to me looking at it in whole. It feels to me like a relationship where she chases after him a bit. Even the people around her are like ""girl, why are you with him? He's rude, you can do better"" lol (so true btw, Yanagi is right there... That man has no clue how hard I'm working to date him 😔)

On to the plot now, I don't have so much to say about it. I didn't learn anything new and I'd already guessed Akito was a culprit, same with Souda (in Enomoto's route, he yells headshot as he kills Ichika in the Adonis bad end so I figured he was a gamer). I like Akito, I understand his circumstances, though I doubt he ended up gaining so much out of it, he just ruined his own life. The end of the route with Kazuki and him broke my heart. I still prefer Sanjou as an X-day culprit so far. More of a side note but it's always super funny when they praise me for guessing the plot right. Thanks guys, it's my third playthrough. 😌A few minor things I disliked was how Souda's addiction was treated. Like, no, it's not just about ""waking up and looking at reality"", it's addiction for a reason. And people who fall into addiction aren't always irrational. The stuff with the chip will also always be funny. Ah yes, the chip with forgetaboutyourcrimes.exe on it... 

Now, I don't know if that was only me, but Sasazuka's route is the buggiest so far in terms of text not showing up where it should or showing the wrong character dialogue box. It annoys me a bit because I'd expect that type of stuff to be patched for a game that costs about $50. It was hilarious to see the box say ""Yanagi"" when Sasazuka said ""shut up"" at one point though, it felt so out of place hahaha  
Other than that, Zero was hilarious for saying ""Seems like you're done"" after hearing Sasazuka trauma dump 💀 And he's correct, their ideals about revenge do align. 

Finally, on the smaller details I picked up: which of you Americans hurt the writing team? Their vision of America is hilarious. It's interesting however that Sasazuka gets along with Sakuragawa better because of her direct nature. As a foreigner who's lived in Japan, I also found that Japanese people who were more direct and open like that were always easier to get along with. I know some of my friends feel the same way. Maybe it's why I love Sakuragawa and Mukai so much.  
Speaking of which, three girls giggling and having lunch, absolute bliss <3 Love these three! I kinda feel like Sakuragawa and Ichika's relationship in this route feels more transactional though :')  
Morioka is still very hot and so is Minegishi. Minegishi has Sebastian (Black Butler) vibes appearance wise, I love him. Also, he speaks beautiful Japanese. I think it's because he's always so polite, but he sounds so well-spoken and elegant, I should listen to his dialogues more to improve my formal Japanese lol. He's described by Ichika as elite in this route and that's SO valid.  
I keep thinking about it and I keep forgetting to mention it but the collar is not cold 😂 It's like when YA authors call piercings cold metal, it's in contact with skin, it's at least lukewarm.  
I found out this route that Kazuki's name is actually かづき not かずき (香月 in kanji). I was mindblown. Also, Kazuki calling him lame was very funny, get his a\*\* Kazuki!  
Sasazuka not understanding teenage slang was very real, points for that. However, he immediately loses those points for proposing to buy groceries and complaining about it to Ichika afterwards.  
Sasazuka is awful to Enomoto and that's why we're both in the Sasazuka hate club.  
Souda crying made me sad, Souda saying muda muda muda made me think of Dio.  
Sakuragawa said ""Even I'd want you for my wife"" and I need her route now.  
When Sasazuka says ""I thought I was going to lose you again"", what he actually says in Japanese is closer to ""I thought I was going to lose a loved one right in front of me again"". Ichika is a terrible detective btw because she hears that and goes ""What could this possibly mean?"" 😭 Girl, focus.  
Sasazuka needs a therapist too, add him on the waiting list. Unrelated, but is it insensitive if I say his mom's killer looks kinda cute? 👉👈  
Their taxi budget is crazy. On a cop salary??  
I wanted to mention this since Enomoto's route but thought I'd wait for his own route, but it's becoming too much of a thing so I'm gonna say it now. I still love Yanagi, he's still my fav, but he has a tendency to not take sides when he actually should or passively let some things happen. Like, Sasazuka will call you dumb and he just won't say anything. I think it's partly due to him being indecisive and too measured, which I just hope will get adressed in his route. Side note because I forgot to mention it before but my guess is that Ichika and Yanagi know each other because she recognises his voice in the prologue.  
Finally, I relate to Ichika's ultimatum being ""Or else I'll cry"", she's just like me fr, I have no card up my sleeve lol.

Anyway, this is a bit more unfocused I think but it's more or less all I had to say on this route. I feel very lukewarm about it, it's a bit forgettable to me. If you loved it, I love that for you! This is just my personal opinion on it. 

I'm now going to go cry over Ichika sleeping with Sasazuka after he half-assed his confession (free my sisters from the bare minimum...) and I'll get to Mr. Angsty Shiraishi. I just know he's an Ukyo, he can't fool me!!",4,1755463855.0,otomegames,1,1.0,False

I’m a 24-year-old from Wisconsin and I’ll be finishing up my Associate’s in Cybersecurity next summer. I’m strongly considering transferring to Western Washington University in Bellingham to complete my Bachelor’s (likely the Cybersecurity B.S.), and I’ll be 25 by the time I’d start at WWU.

I’m really excited about the program and the PNW vibe (forest, mountains, water, etc.), but since I’ll be a bit older than the typical undergrad, I’ve got a few questions for current or recent WWU students — especially anyone who transferred in or was “non-traditional” age-wise.

**Housing:** What are the best options for someone my age? Does WWU have a lot of transfer students living on-campus, or do most older transfers go straight to off-campus housing? Are there certain apartment complexes or neighborhoods in Bellingham that are better for mid-20s students (and maybe a little quieter than freshman-heavy spots)? Any areas to avoid?

**Social Life / Nightlife:** I know Bellingham has a reputation for being a college town with a chill but fun scene — breweries, coffee shops, and outdoors stuff rather than frat row craziness. For someone mid-20s, is it easy to find people to hang with who are more into hikes, concerts, and brewery nights instead of house parties?

**Age Demographics:** I saw that WWU has a decent number of transfers and older students, especially in upper-level programs. Does that feel noticeable in classes, or do you still mostly find yourself surrounded by 19–20 year olds?

**Being “Looked At Differently”:** This is probably my biggest worry. Do professors or classmates treat you differently if you’re a bit older? I’m definitely coming in serious about my studies (I want to work in cybersecurity long-term), but I also want to have a solid social life and not feel like the “old guy in class.”

**General Transfer Vibe:** For those who came in with an associate’s — how smooth was the transition? Did you feel welcomed into the WWU community, or was it tough to break into established friend groups? Any tips for making that jump from community college to WWU?

I’d really appreciate any honest insights, positive or negative. Just trying to get a realistic picture of what life at WWU would feel like for someone in my shoes!",0,1755463730.0,WWU,7,0.5,False

I have no problem with the fact that there is a waitlist because it’s obviously a busy airport. 

The problem I have is that they have a grab and go section with quick sandwiches, coffee, drink station for filling my water bottle, etc. I’d be perfectly happy to pop in there after letting them validate my card and membership. 

They refused to let me in stating that it is in their protocols to make you wait on the waitlist and only then you can access the grab and go when your name is called. My flight leaves in 20 mins so I just wanted to utilize my card I pay a hefty price for.

I brought up that I am not impacting their capacity. I would be in and out in 2 mins or less. 

Why is this a policy? Am I crazy here? I spoke with 2 of the managers calmly and politely just to ask more about why it was a rule. They said they don’t know, but it is very strict so there is nothing they can do. 

Anyone else experience this or can you please shed some light on why it is this way? Especially when they have a grab and go section and I’m not trying to go get a drink at the bar or get into the lounge side.

I am in the military and I am not sure what to do at this point. Over 3 months ago my roommate and I reported a crack forming in the floor of our shower in our bathroom. The barracks maintenance came in to fix it and work was going steady for about 2 weeks. During this time we were having to sleep in a vacant room as we were both on night shift. Whenever we’d return to the room it would be trashed (empty cups of coffee on my bed, trash in the corners of the room). Then the worked stop. They left all of their stuff and never came back to our room to finish the bathroom. It’s been over 3 months since anyone has came in. During this time we’ve jumped from vacant room to vacant room to shower in but each time the barracks moves in someone without telling us. When this happens they throw out our belongings. I’m down 3 towels, 2 Full bottles of body wash, and a bottle of shampoo. I’ve told my chain of command and nothing is being done. What can I do?

I don’t speak for everyone, but being one’s self in the world today isn’t easy. I ventured to guess most aren’t who they appear to be. Are you? I welcome any and all feedback. Please, do enjoy…

Act One
 
There’s a silence that lives in the moments before morning. A hush not of stillness, but of readiness. As if the day itself waits in the wings—nervous, excited, trembling slightly under the weight of the curtain.
 
And then… cue the light.
 
It filters in warm through the open window—an amber haze that lands not arbitrarily, but with intention. It rests across the cheek of the man in the bed as if chosen. As if earned. He doesn’t flinch. Not at first. He inhales slowly, a chest rising with perfect tempo, and then—he grins. A slow smile, foolish and full. The kind a child might wear when they remember it’s their birthday before the cake is even baked. He opens his eyes as though it’s a pleasure, not a burden. He stretches, not with a groan, but a sway. One leg finds the floor, then the other, and before gravity can remember its role, he’s already aloft.
 
Not walking. Not quite. Gliding.
 
Across the wooden floors of his apartment, he dances. Barefoot. Effortless. He twirls past the curtains—long, billowy things that catch the morning light like soft stage scrims. The city waits beyond them, not bustling, but smiling. No horns. No voices. No clatter. Only a few petals that drift past his window on some invisible breeze, as though the season had sent him a bouquet in motion.
 
The kettle whistles on cue.
 
He waltzes to it, removing it from the burner with a flourish of the wrist. A white mug waits near the sink, its handle turned just so, as if it had dressed itself this morning to be ready for him. He pours, the steam rising like fog across a footlit stage. He closes his eyes again, breathes it in.
 
His fish watches from the bowl by the window.
 
And then—so help you—it dances. A bob. A dart. A shimmering twirl as it spins through its little globe of glass. He taps the bowl in rhythm. The fish flicks its tail in reply.
 
He chuckles. “You’re ready for Broadway,” he says, and gives a stately tip of the head.
 
Back to the center of the apartment. A wardrobe stands tall like a co-star waiting in the wings. He opens it, selects the suit—today, a slate grey with silk black lapels, pressed to perfection. A tie the color of crushed berries. Shoes so polished you’d think they were dipped in mirror.
 
He dresses like a man who’s never known a misstep. One button at a time, humming as he goes.
 
And then—oh, then—breakfast. Two eggs, cooked with a flourish. Toast arched high from the toaster like stage props sprung from the floorboards. He plate-spins, pirouettes, flips the eggs onto the dish with a motion just shy of magic. Coffee, toast, eggs, and a slice of honeyed fruit—balanced atop a tray as he dances to the table. Even the chair seems to slide out for him on its own.
 
He eats slowly. Smiling. Joyful. Not grateful. Why would he be grateful for a gift he gives himself every day?
 
He finishes the last sip of coffee, wipes the corners of his mouth with a neatly folded napkin, and glances at the clock on the wall. Time to go.
 
He shrugs on his coat. A single movement, like a cape unfurling. His shoes clack once against the floor as he turns toward the door, then stops. He raises a finger in parting to the fish.
 
“You’ve been a lovely audience.”
 
The fish bows. Or maybe blinks. He takes it as both.
 
He opens the door. And the city is waiting.
 
The stoop doesn’t lead down so much as unfold—three shallow steps onto a stage built just for him. The lighting is perfect. The wind? Composed. A sidewalk set by gods with immaculate taste.
 
He descends in rhythm. One, two, three. Snap. Ball change. Plié. Jazz hands.
 
The music in his head builds. Swells. He spins out into the street, arms wide.
 
No people. No cars. No dogs yapping or food carts hissing. Just the occasional flurry of pigeons that rise in time with his leap from one square of sidewalk to the next.
 
He passes storefronts with mannequins that appear to smile. Mailboxes that tip slightly in greeting. A bicycle bell chimes in the distance—no rider in sight. The light changes—green, always green.
 
He sings now. Wordless, tuneful joy. He knows the notes without knowing how. The melody belongs to him, and the city hums along.
 
He pauses at a corner, steps aside, and with a playful smile tips an imaginary hat. “Pardon me, madame. May I cut in?” And dances into the crosswalk.
 
He spins once more. Arms open wide. Face tilted to the sky.
 
He’s not on his way to work. He’s on his way to purpose. And purpose is everything.
 
And then, rounding a quiet corner, he sees it.
 
The theater.His cathedral. His heart. His home.
 
But not yet.
 
First, he stops. Places one hand gently across his chest, head lowered. A reverent pause.
 
“Good morning, darling,” he says to the old marquee. The letters, arranged just so, spell the name of the show he’s starred in for years. It needs no updating. The bulbs blink in sequence, as if winking.
 
He ascends the stairs. One step. Two. Three. The doors open before he touches them.
 
And inside—it’s empty. Of course it is.
 
The chandeliers are aglow, but no audience waits. The velvet carpet is soft beneath his feet. He glides through the lobby. Past the ticket booth. The velvet ropes. The posters that bear his name.
 
He hums.
 
Through the double doors. Down the aisle. The rows and rows and rows of empty seats curve like arms, ready to embrace.
 
He smiles at them, as if greeting old friends. “Again? You’ve come again?” he says softly. “Oh, you’re too kind. Drinks after the curtain—on me.”
 
He steps onto the stage.
 
Breathes.
 
The house lights warm his face like sun on a windowsill. He walks to the edge, sits, and lets his feet dangle—like a child. He kicks them softly.
 
He laughs.
 
He wraps his arms around himself and leans forward, basking.
 
This is love. This is mastery. This is home.
 
He could sit there forever. But he doesn’t. Because the show must go on.
 
 
Act Two
 
Crickety-clack. The dressing room door closes behind him—not a thud, but a beat. One more step in the choreography.
 
He doesn’t simply enter. He arrives. A pivot on one heel. A slide across the lacquered floorboards. A casual toss of the coat, lofted like a cape over the back of the chair. He grins to no one in particular. Maybe to the mirror. Maybe to the room.
 
“Made it,” he says, breathlessly, as though he’d crossed a finish line only he could see.
 
The room greets him in silence. It is a familiar quiet—soft, heavy, and deliberate. The hush of wood and velvet. The breath of powder and old paper. The dressing room doesn’t creak or hum. It simply waits.
 
The mirror stands in place, unmoved. Wide. Tall. Ringed with a halo of frosted bulbs that glow a steady amber. Not bright. Not cold. Just warm enough to touch, but not warm enough to trust.
 
He doesn’t sit. Not yet.
 
Instead, he begins to undress. Not hurried. Not lazy. Practiced. The jacket first—shrugged off with a little shoulder roll and a fingertip flourish, spun once on his finger before he drapes it over the rack. The tie, loosened with two fingers and whipped once in the air like a ribbon before hanging it neatly. He hums a bar or two—soft, tuneless, content.
 
The shirt buttons, undone one by one, from throat to waist. He plucks each like a piano key. The undershirt lifts overhead with a quick, graceful sweep. Even the slacks—he steps out of them with a half-kick, one heel flicking behind him. A little laugh. Barefoot now, in the quiet. He twirls once for no one.
 
And then the stretch—arms above the head, fingers steepled, spine bowed slightly back. He inhales. This is the last breath of the man who danced through the streets.
 
And then the costume waits. Hanging there like a question. Crisp. Expectant.
 
He doesn’t rush it. He approaches it. One leg, then the other. He slides into the pressed black slacks, cinches the waistband, fastens the clasp. A white undershirt follows. Then the vest—charcoal with black piping, buttons like eyes watching him as he fastens each one.
 
He sits to pull on the shoes. Patent leather. Gleaming. He can see the blur of his own face in them. They shine more than they should. He ties the laces once. Then again.
 
His hands are slower now. Not clumsy—but less fluid. His breath has shortened. His posture changed. The sway in his spine replaced by straight lines. Angles. Intent.
 
He stands and adjusts. The shoulders. The collar. The cuffs. The pant legs. He runs his hand down each thigh, smoothing invisible imperfections. The transformation is nearly complete.
 
Now the face. A mirror to the soul.
 
He moves to the vanity and lays out the tools. The comb. The brush. The white towel, folded in quarters. The compact. The rouge. The liner. The powder. A glass of water, half full, placed just left of center. Each item takes its position like players on a stage. Each one a weapon against what’s underneath.
 
He hums as he works. Not a melody now—just a droning note. Familiar. Unnamed. A thread from some forgotten tune. It echoes slightly in the quiet, caught between glass and skin.
 
He reaches for the script. The pages are worn. Soft at the corners. A flick of the thumb, and it opens to the monologue. He recites the first line under his breath. Not loud. Not for anyone. Just enough to feel the shape of it in his mouth.
 
He finally sits. The chair gives just a little under his weight—a low creak like a whisper. His knees fall open. His arms rest on the counter. He leans forward.
 
And then… he sees himself. Not just his reflection. Himself.
 
There’s a second of pause. Maybe less. The kind of pause no one else would notice—but he does. He always does.
 
He blinks. The lights around the mirror flicker once. Not in failure. In fatigue. They recover quickly, but something has already shifted. The warmth they offered a moment ago now feels performative. Painted on.
 
He reaches for the powder. The puff lands soft against his cheek. Tap. Tap. Sweep. He leans closer. Closer. He holds his breath and dusts again. He watches the skin disappear. Not vanish. Not hide. Just… soften. Blur. Become acceptable. A second puff, beneath the chin.
 
Then the liner. The smallest brush in the tray. Black, precise. He draws the line the way a soldier edges a blade—steady hand, shallow breath. One lid. Then the other.
 
He blinks again. The man in the mirror does too—but somehow… later.
 
His eyes return to the script. He speaks the line again. A little louder. Not because he wants to—but because he needs to hear it right. The phrasing. The cadence. The breath between syllables.
 
He gets it wrong. He swallows.
 
Back to the mirror. A dab of color to the cheeks. Not enough to shout. Just enough to be seen. The final touch.
 
And then he stares.Not long. But long enough.
 
The humming stops. He doesn’t know when. He doesn’t start it again.
 
His fingers twitch.
 
He stands, but slower than he sat. Adjusts the tie. Smooths the lapels. His hand lingers at his chest. He presses—twice. Reassurance? Reminder? Ritual?
 
He turns back toward the door. And stops. His hand on the knob. His body still angled toward the mirror. As if waiting for the man in the glass to move first.
 
He doesn’t. Neither does the reflection. But they both know what comes next.
 
 
Act Three
 
The door opens. Not with drama. Not with dread. Just with a gentle, resigned swing—as though it already knows what waits on the other side.
 
He steps through.
 
And the moment he does, the air changes. Gone is the warmth of solitude. In its place: backstage—a living artery of movement and anticipation. This is not chaos. This is orchestration.
 
A costumer threads sequins into a bodice under a desk lamp. A lighting tech tests cues with fingers tapping against her clipboard like a conductor’s baton. A dancer stretches near a wall, limbs trembling with readiness. Someone hums a scale. Another counts silently with their fingers—one, two, three, four… one, two, three, four…
 
He walks among them. Slow. Silent. Purposeful.
 
His shoes make a sound that only he seems to notice. Not loud, but deliberate. A clean, confident rhythm that’s been polished over years. Heel. Toe. Glide. Heel. Toe. Glide. Each step forward carries the weight of expectation. Not theirs. His. Because whether they’re looking or not—he feels seen.
 
A pair of actors laugh softly as he passes, rehearsing lines between breaths. Another brushes past him, nods politely. “You’ll be brilliant,” the man says. But it washes over him like rain hitting a pane of glass—acknowledged only as a sound, not a meaning. He nods back, rehearsed, unsure if the gesture even finished. Because his mind is elsewhere. Because he’s already hearing it—
 
The crowd.
 
It starts in pieces. A laugh near the back. A seat creaking open. The rustle of silk and cotton. Programs folding. Unfolding. Folding again. A cough. Another. The sound of someone unwrapping a mint they’ve already decided not to eat.
 
He keeps walking.
 
The hallway narrows. The lights dim. The carpet absorbs his steps, but the air doesn’t. It grows thicker with every breath, as if judgment itself has taken shape in the silence ahead.
 
He straightens his vest. Touches the knot of his tie—once, twice.
 
The stage manager passes, calling out a note into her headset. Her words don’t reach him, but her presence does. Everyone has a role. And his is moments away.
 
He rounds the final bend, and the curtain stands before him. Tall. Dark. Imposing. A wall of velvet just shy of breathing.
 
Behind it: the watchers.
 
He can feel them now. Not their gaze. Not exactly. Their ease. The way they lean back into the soft embrace of velvet seats. The careless flip of a playbill. The slow cross of a leg over a knee. The private murmurs. The expectation of entertainment.
 
They don’t see the weight in his chest. They don’t hear the mantra repeating behind his eyes.
 
Remember your lines. Remember your marks. Painted face. Painted voice. Painted man.
 
He closes his eyes for a moment.
 
The face in the mirror returns—not his own, but the one they’ll see. The one they always see. Not the man. The mask.
 
He takes his mark. Just off-center. Just behind the curtain.
 
Still. Waiting. Ready.
 
And as the orchestra swells—
as the house lights dim—
as the curtain begins to rise—
 
He steps into the light.
 
 
Epilogue - The Note Behind the Mirror
 
(No date. No name. Just a blade folded into paper.)
 
You promised you wouldn’t read this unless the paint was cracking, the script was slipping, and the crowd’s roar started to sound like thunder in your skull.
 
So read it now.
 
This is not a dream. This is the cage you dress up in curtains and light.
 
The world never wanted you. They wanted the idea of you. The glimmer. The polish. The illusion they could clap for and forget. Not the ache beneath. Not the eyes that see too much. Not the skin that doesn’t fit.
 
You stepped onto the stage the first time because you thought it would make them stay. They stayed. But not for you. For the version of you that hurt less to look at.
 
Do you remember the one time—just once—you didn’t perform? When you showed them the face without the paint? The eyes without the sparkle?
 
They recoiled. Not out of anger. That would’ve been mercy. Out of discomfort. Out of revulsion. Like you’d coughed something up they weren’t prepared to see.
 
Not because you were ugly. But because you were unvarnished. And the truth—your truth—was too raw for their polished world.
 
So you put the paint back on. You learned your lines again. You built the smile wide enough to bury your teeth. Not because you enjoy this—but because the alternative is worse.
 
Without the performance, you’re not invisible. You’re exposed. You’re seen, but only long enough for them to look away in horror. You become something they hope never to see again. Not because you’re monstrous. But because you’re honest.
 
So dance. Because the mask makes them clap. Because the mask lets you belong—if only on stage. This isn’t vanity. This isn’t weakness. This is your contract with survival. And every night you sign it again. In sweat. In powder. In silence.
 
You’re not asking them to love you. You’re begging them not to flinch.
 
And when the curtain falls—when you peel it all off and see what’s left—don’t scream. Just read this again. Let it cut. Because pain is honest. Because this is your truth. Because if you ever forget what’s behind the curtain, you might think you can live without it.
 
But you can’t.
 
Now get up. Paint the smile. Fold the note.

He got his notes and his opinion of the show. The underground music scene was getting so saturated it always seemed the same. If he didn’t write down the names of the members of “Bartholomew and the Bart fuckers” when he interviewed them earlier, he would have forgotten them. The openers, “Charles Manson’s Penis”, were coming on, but Norman had seen them before, so he left. He got in his car and took a minute and started on the road. Making it past the lights of a small city, heading down a country road he made it to the spot. An old swimming hole from his youth. The sun was setting though he could not see it leaving a cloudy purple haze lacking depth. Though as he looked up it felt as if it was endless and out of reach. Yet when it was in his periphery Norman found himself feeling claustrophobic. The air was humid yet cold. The once lush green leaves of this forest are now crisp dried dead things. Norman shuffles past them bringing memories up with the mud. After some walking, he hears the drumming of the water an appreciated cleansing white noise. A little further and he’s at the rocks looking toward the shimmering water of the hole. Walking past the familiar moss-covered rocks to the ones that should be washed clean, he sees streaks of red that he is all too familiar with. He looks up past the water and sees a family of deer. Norman follows their eyes to the vortex in the water. He sees dark blues and greens stained by a darker red. Reaching out of the water is a swirling hand blood stained and presenting a frog. Norman jumps with intent on saving a life. The frog jumps out of the water and stares as Norman pulls and pulls to no avail. The corpse is falling apart as he pulls. Norman looks under the water and, in a blur, sees that the corpse is chained at the ankles to something hidden under the boulders at the bottom of the stream. Norman gets out of the water shivering and starts looking around. After seeing nothing his attention fixes to the croaking frog. He picks it up and decides to walk back to the road where he can get some cell service to call the authorities. The frog is silent and so is Norman. He makes it back to his car, sets the frog down and makes the call.

“Hello, I’d like to report a dead body.” Said Norman

The dispatch responded, “What is your location?”

“I’m just off the side of Dire Wolf Road.”

“Alright, someone's on their way hang tight.”

He waits and the night grows dark. Soon the only light comes from his headlights. Norman turns on the heaters in an attempt to dry off. He’s shivering and staring at the frog that is gently clasped in his hands. It’s silent and still. Their eyes are locked into each other’s. Norman finds himself seeing a relived vision of the events that transpired when he found the body when looking into the black orbs that are the frog’s eyes. Then when the memory was over, he saw red, white and blue. Norman was nervous. He set down the frog, took a deep breath and got out of the car. The frog followed. The cop is already out of the car.

He approaches Norman and asks, “What happened?”

“I found a body at the falls.”

“Why are you wet?”

“I got in, I thought they were alive for a second.”

The cop says nothing for a moment.

“Show me where and then when everyone else gets here we will figure out what happened.”

Norman shakes his head and hears the frog croak. He picks it up and starts walking. He started on the right track but the dark surrounding the cops flashlight is disorienting. The only sound is the shuffling of leaves and the frog. Norman realizes he’s lost. He stops walking for a second and the frog stops croaking. The cop understands what happened and brings out a map.

“Where exactly were you at?”

Norman makes an educated guess but is still unsure. The cop is not. The cop takes the lead. Norman follows shivering and teeth chattering. After following their new direction, the sound of water becomes apparent. They are close. Continuing to approach Norman stops once the cop’s flashlight reveals the blood on the rocks. The cop then shines his light in the water. The corpse being revealed and unrevealed by the vortex. He approaches to confirm what he only saw in glimpses. The spinning hand leaves Norman in a trance. He doesn’t notice the frog jump out of his hands. The frog out of sight in a shadow takes the shadows form. Then from its caste arises a man. A man covered in mossy rags and face obscured by the skull of a stag. He blows a kiss. From this kiss forms a monarch butterfly. The butterfly heads toward the cop. It touches the cop. He rises to flames and drops the flashlight. The cop falls to the ground writhing. Then he tries to crawl to the water. Norman goes to help but a firm hand grabs him. Norman stops in fear. The cop now lies still; the fire starts to die. Norman stares in disbelief as he is handed a pair of shackles from the man behind him. Norman turns to look behind him. The only thing he sees is a crowd of frogs slightly illuminated by the fire. Norman panics and runs across the stream taking only the shackles and the clothes on his back. Now wet again Norman goes as fast as he can in a straight direction. He doesn’t know or care where he is going.

 As he goes deeper into the forest the day begins to break. He stumbles by a cave. Sees a bear climbing a tree going for a bee’s nest. He stops for a moment. The bear doesn’t notice him. Norman’s heart is warmed. For a moment he thinks he can be safer just for one day. Then he goes to the cave. He finds a cub. He stops setting down the shackles, the bear hears this and drops down. Norman’s heart beats faster as he stays still. The cub comes and smells him. Then they all stay still for a moment. Norman slowly walks away. The bear’s attention left him. Then once they are out of view Norman picks up his pace. Though he is tired, wet and sick. He makes it down a hill and finds himself in someone’s field. He feels the warm sun against his face. He decides to scan around, there isn’t anyone around at the moment. Norman decides to keep his distance from the buildings. Though he hopes to make it to the road. As he walks keeping his head low he hears a gunshot. He decides to book it.

At the road now Norman starts walking with his thumb up.  A speeding car pulls over almost hitting him and stops.  Norman approaches the car. He sees a young woman in the driver’s seat.

She says “Did you hear a gunshot?”

Norman stares at her for a second confused. Then his heart stops and feels dread.

He blurts out, “They shot the bear!”

“What!?”

“Can we leave?”

“Fuck it where do you want to go?”

“At least the next state over.”

“Get in.” she said, opening the door.

Norman got in and they drove away together in a calm demeanor. Norman just slightly damp now. He was starting to feel sleepy and almost dozed off but then the girl slapped him.

“You got some explaining to do.”

“I don’t know where to start. Basically I’m innocent but I found a body and then watched a cop die.”

“That’s crazy but explains why I saw the cops.”

“What do you mean?”

“Well I was at a concert, got kinda confused and decided to stay till I was sober in the morning. Then when I was good I went to clear my mind in nature. I was almost at the spot, saw a crime scene and just drove by and then I saw you and heard a gunshot. Then you said something about a bear and I got even more confused. Why would they kill a bear?”

“I suppose it could be self defense, but they found the shackles now.”

“Shackles?”

“Yeah a fucked up gift from a frog man.”

“You’re crazy.”

“I am still processing it cause I went to the stream earlier from a concert as well and found a body. So I called the cops and then everything went to shit.”

“Wait, you were also at the concert?”

“Yeah I was writing an article on Bartholomew and the Bart fuckers and when they were done I left.”

“Ok so we didn’t go to the same concert. Tell me what happened when the cops arrived.”

“Well you wouldn’t believe me cause I’m crazy.”

“Fine, but you’ll have to explain fully to me later.”

Then Norman fell asleep.

He woke up later in the car in a parking lot. The girl came to him and brought him a change of clothes.

“Where are we?”

“Vermont.”

“Ok so we should be safe for the meantime.”

“You mean you're safe, I didn't do anything.”

“Fair, and appreciated but you saved me and I don’t even know your name.”

“It’s Alice, but fuck you for almost taking me down with you.”

“Ok Alice, like the band but I never read the book.”

“God you’re so retarded.”

“Anyway, I'm Norman and I know where we can hide.”

“Great, what brilliant idea does ‘Norman’ have now?”

“Well, we find some weird commune cult thingy and live like that and just hope they are normal but more importantly off the grid.”

“Great idea ‘Norman’ how are we going to find that.”

“Well, I know criminals hide there but they advertise so we can window shop.”

“Ok but I pick.”

“Fine”

So, she went on her phone and searched the internet for a place to hide. She showed him a couple of different places. Eventually they agreed to go to the one that had the least amount of information available online that they could still find. It was in Vermont conveniently for them. Norman left the car with the clothes to go change quick. He threw out his old clothes and they left.

During the drive Alice didn’t talk because she found herself driving and not really knowing what was going to happen. Norman just didn’t know what to say. In an hour’s time they arrived.

Alice got out first and approached the large structure. Norman got out as well but saw people working outside. Norman went to talk to them while Alice went inside.

Norman tried to speak, and they just gave him tools and told him “Work”

Norman appreciated this and just went to work. While Norman did his best to fit in Alice was inside talking to the head of the commune.

It was a man named Gary, he simply said “get to work and we will see if you can spend the night.”

 So, Alice came outside and went to work. After an assortment of chores, the sun started to set painting the sky purple, pink and orange. Norman and Alice both took a moment to admire the sky. As they did, they both pondered their time here.

A gust of wind blew in Gary. Who asked the question that was on everyone’s mind, “So, are you staying or going?”

“I don’t know. Can I slee— “ Alice started to say before being interrupted

“No, I need an answer now before it starts.”

“Before what starts?” asked Norman

“If you stay for the ceremony I can show you.”

Alice was suspicious of Gary but could see Norman was curious and frankly out of options.

“After the ceremony I’ll decide if I’m staying or leaving.” Said Alice

“I’ll stay,” said Norman

“Follow me” Gary said while walking toward the rest of the commune.

They all met on top of a hill and were looking at the sky.

While looking at the sky Norman said, “You know Gary, this is a good life.”

Gary nodded and went back to look at the sky. At that moment the clouds bulged down. Then when the clouds broke an orb of light was revealed. The light was steadily getting brighter, overpowering the sun’s reflection off the clouds turning the masterpiece into a blank canvas.

“Come here and drink this,” said Gary.

“Nah fuck that. This is too weird for me. I’m out,” said Norman.

The orb shined brighter, causing Alice and Norman to turn away. When they looked at the faces of the others, they saw no fear. All they did was smile and look at the light. In an instant the light went out. Alice and Norman started to run but Norman tripped. As Alice helped Norman up he turned and looked at the others. They saw white blobs descending from the once illuminated orb. The white blobs approached. 

He could hear one of the members of the commune say “Ah, grandparents you’ve come to be reunited with us.” 

The alien beings then absorbed the commune. This reunion looked like cotton candy being dropped in water. Norman and Alice ran in fear. A horde followed them. They headed toward the mountain in hopes the horde would just slide down.

They made it to the base of the mountain exhausted. They took a moment to look behind them and saw what must have been thousands of them. They scrambled to get up the mountain, grabbing on to small trees and rocks. Their hands became raw. Part of the way up they looked down and saw the blobs failing to roll up the mountain. They had a moment of refuge. Then they looked at the sky and saw more orbs of light in the distance. It was as if the stars had fallen to earth. They began to climb again and agreed they needed to get to the car again somehow. They made it to the top. The sun had risen again. Maybe the blobs would leave now. Then in an instant they knew they were wrong. The blobs had merged. The culmination of the blobs rivaled the size of the mountain. A tsunami of slime was crashing against the mountain. Alice and Norman started falling down the opposite face as the mountain started to collapse. All that remained was dirt. Somehow, they both survived.

Getting up from the rubble Alice and Norman started back to the car. This time Norman drove while Alice slept. He felt guilty for dragging her into that but was also so confused about what had just happened. After aimlessly driving Norman found that every road led to a detour. Eventually the detours lead them into a place that wasn’t quite a city or town but some strange thing in between. There was smoke all around. A building was on fire and authorities were fighting it. However, there were clean tinted vehicles and Norman decided to avoid the scene. He looked at a homeless person getting questioned and realized his face was gone, a scratchy haze around it. Perhaps it was the smoke. However, when he looked at Alice he saw the same thing. He decided not to alarm her right away. He wanted to leave already but then in his attempt to avoid the scene he ran into a checkpoint. Government men of some sort approached the car, their faces just as obscured. Alice awoke and screamed at the sight. Norman tried to calm her, and the government men tried to take control of the situation. Their interrogation began immediately.

A voice from the static said, “Where are you coming from?”

“Where are your faces, Norman, where is your face?”

“Same place as yours.”

Alice looked in the Mirror and gasped.

“What’s going on here?” said Norman.

The government men pulled them out of the car and put them with the rest of the town in a bar. The whole town was affected. Inside there was a man in a suit on stage.

 He simply said “Yes there are aliens, no you cannot tell anyone. Alright that’s it, folks time to go back to dancing.”

The crowd in the bar started mumbling growling at each other.

Someone shouted, “What about the murderer, and our faces!?”

Their answer was the cold cruelty of a door being slammed shut. The people chefed it to a drink.

“Do you think the murderer is in here with us?”

“Well, they could get away with it now that we can’t see who’s who.”

“Plus, that building's on fire. Not everyone is in here.”

“I say we leave.”

“Agreed.”

So those who were talking left and those who drank stayed. Norman and Alice were the first to attempt to push open the doors. It budged slightly open, but the stage man’s body was in the way. Norman slid through and looked at the body outside alone. Some government men were coming around the corner and saw him. Norman started running. They saw him, radioing it in. One went to the corpse, the other went after Norman.

Alice pushed the door, interrupting the Government man’s examination. Then the crowd saw. They froze. Alice was pushed back in. The government followed. He took out a notebook and sat in the corner. Alice went back for the door. The man pulled a gun.

“No one leaves.”

Meanwhile outside Norman was alone in an alley. Then behind him a government man pulled out a blade. Before he could stab Norman, another government man came.

“Don’t its not him.”

The man stopped for a second. Sighed and put it away.

“What did you see?”

“I just wanted to leave, and the body was blocking the door.”

“You and me, let's talk.” Said the man with the knife to the other. They began to walk away.

“This is getting really messy”

“I know”

Norman watched the blade dig into the man’s back. Norman started to run again. This time he went into a random building. He found himself in an apartment corridor. The man right behind him. Norman started banging on the doors. No one answered. Norman was trapped. The man caught up and they faced each other for a moment.

“Why?” Norman asked.

“Eating them is the only way I can see their faces. Their memories then blend into mine and then I get my frame. Which is you.”

Then the door opened. Alice was there now holding a frog. It hopped out. The man went to stab Norman and succeeded. As Alice ran towards them the man carved a chunk out and ate part of Norman's flesh. Now Norman could see his face. The cannibal went for another stab but Alice kicked him in the balls. The man didn’t react much, but this gave Norman time to get control of the hand with the knife. He pulled it so it was stuck in the ground. The man went to strangle Norman, but Alice started strangling him. The man turned out of it, pushed Alice to the ground, and pulled out another knife. Norman got up but the man was now facing him again. Norman decided to kick open the door to room three. It was an empty room without windows. Him the frog and the man with the knife went in. Now alone in the hall Alice grabbed the knife plunged into the ground. She prepared to go through the door and was confused why she didn’t hear a struggle. She went through and found herself just outside of a bog. In the center Norman was tied to a tree being cut by the Man surrounded by dead corpses who were decomposing strew across the dead trees' life still crawling on them. As this happened a frog came to Alice and spit out a black teddy bear with yellow button eyes. She stabbed it and blood sprayed in her face. The man dropped. Alice ran through the bog and untied Norman.

“Thanks for saving me, how did you find me?”

“I heard them over the radio in the bar that they had found you so I left through the kitchen. Then I simply thought where would Norman go.”

“What about the frog?”

“An old drunk gave it to me in an attempt to calm me down.”

“Do you see them?”

“Oh the frogs were in a swamp silly that’s to be expected.”

“No, the government men are here.”

“You two couldn’t just stay and dance could you.”

They looked at each other and finally were able to look at faces.

Together they both said “We want some answers”

They were ignored and the government dragged the body to shore. They took a dead raven from his jacket.

“We got it,” one of them chirped on the radio.

“Is that why we couldn’t see faces, some sick magic conjured by the government.”

“Just talk to the frog. It will explain it to you.”

In that instance the men disappeared. Alice and Norman went to the shore and sat down. The frog spat out a first aid kit. Alice went to tend to Norman's wounds.

After some wincing during the cleaning and dressing the frog began to speak. “The man killed the bird and was cursed. They blinded him from faces. It was meant to be a temporary punishment, but he kept the corpse. Its conscience kept his curse alive. A man of science, he decided to study his brain. Instead of looking for a cure he made a machine that did the same thing by preventing the neurons from firing when looking at someone’s face. The government bought it and hired him. Then the dead bird told him he could see faces again if he ate a piece of them. From there he went crazy and started murdering and lighting buildings on fire to get away while the government tried to contain the blobs.”

“So what now.” Said Norman

“Now you two are hired. You get to head to Salem Massachusetts. Look into the eye on lake street.” The frog croaked.

Then the frog started hopping and they both followed. In a short while they made it to a car with keys hanging out the door. Phones and wallets inside for both of them. They went to check the news. Nothing on the orbs or blobs was posted. However, when they looked in the rear view mirror, they saw blobs rolling towards them. Alice set her GPS to Lake Street Salem Massachusetts and started driving recklessly again. Norman fell asleep.

Norman awoke to music playing gently in the hotel. He checked his phone. There was nothing. He checked his wounds and they were healed. He looked around and found himself alone. Taking out his phone he tried to make sense of where he was. He left the room. Walking down the hall he kept his head down as he passed people. Leaving the building without checking out he set his GPS to Lake Street. An hour’s walk away. 

Alice was speeding but still a little slower than usual. The trees surrounding the highway started to dissipate. She took an exit and headed into a bleak gray business sector of New York State. She waits for the traffic pass before turning. Eventually she makes it to a fenced and gated building. The guards let her through, and she is directed to a parking spot. She is escorted into the building. They pass a receptionist and head straight into the elevator. They find themselves seated outside of an office. Alice can overhear a muffled argument and looks at the guards. She can see their faces, but they are wearing sunglasses. One is reading a magazine, the other is at attention. They wait. Eventually the argument stopped. The door opened.

A voice said “Come in”

Alice sat up and went in alone. Inside she saw several doctors at attention and two men at the desk. One was sitting in a chair, the other one was sitting on the finely sculpted desk that’s top had a scattering of several manilla folders.

“Who are you people?” Alice asked.

The man sitting on the desk got up and closed the door and then said, “I’m Mr. Bohr, this is Mr. Walters, and these are our lab rats.”

Then Mr. Walters said “Alice, we have a proposal for you. The doctors are going to take you for an experiment. Then we can discuss hiring you as an agent.”

“I want answers first before I agree to anything.” Said Alice.

“The doctors will explain,” said Mr. Bohr

The doctors marched out of the room. Alice followed them out.

“Start explaining”

“All we know is that we are cloning your brain.”

“Why and how? I don’t think I’m comfortable doing this. I just want my life back and to be safe.”

“Can’t tell you why but you can definitely say goodbye to comfort and safety. Though I think with this procedure you will gain a little respite. The procedure is actually relatively simple, after some research with apes we have been able to cultivate a whole brain from one cell from their spinal fluid. With proper engineering we used the brain to make the most superior computer yet. You just happen to be an ideal candidate. Also, you can consider this as free healthcare since we are going to run you through some tests before we start our experiment.”

They made it to the elevator and one of the doctors pressed on the basement floor. They went down and when the doors opened, they were met with more security, blocking another elevator in a small room. They were allowed into the next elevator and went down again to floor b-7. On floor b-7 they brought Alice to a room with a machine that looked similar to MRI.

The doctors talked in the other room and Mr. Bohr and Mr. Walters walked in.

“Why do you need a brain scan? Isn’t the spinal fluid enough?” said Mr. Walters.

“We need to know the structure of the brain down to the last neuron. You wouldn’t make a building without a blueprint.”

The other doctors nodded in agreement.

“Yeah, but she’s still awake. Wouldn’t be best to do this without interference from her thoughts.” Said Mr. Bohr.

“We are going to make two, one from a still living brain that we reprogram using her neural pathways and another that will take longer but be straight clonal material. We are doing this to interview her without her knowledge.”

“So, whatever, she is thinking right now we get to know?” said Mr. Walters

“Yes.”

“Will there be any interference with the memories of the donor brain?” said Mr. Bohr

“Not sure but we have some questions about that person’s life too. This is so exciting I truly have no clue what to expect.”

“I wonder who the donor was, and I wonder what Alice is thinking right now.” Said Mr. Walters.

The scan started. Alice began to think about the ethics of this experiment. She didn’t fully trust the people behind it. She began to wonder about the future. She hoped this would be an advancement into the future that would help future generations, although with knowledge of these people’s history with technology she felt skeptical. The scan was complete. She sat up. The doctors then came in with a large needle. They slowly plunged it into her spine and drew out the fluid. The doctors left and Mr. Bohr and Mr. Walters came in. They grabbed Alice and locked her in a mostly empty room that only had an intercom, camera, and a knife.

Alice went up to the intercom and said, “Do I get to see Norman again.”

“No”

Alice then grabbed the knife and cut her hand.

Meanwhile scientists put their new fluids to use. The scientist put the cells in a heated solution to activate the genes that grow brain tissue. A quarter of the 20ml is pulled from Alice into the donor brain which is a head with the top of the skull cut off that also has a beating heart and breathing lungs connected to tubing connected to the head. The brain stem had been connected to a monitor and a computer with a brand-new quantum CPU. They kept the computer off. The serum of spinal fluid had started to grow new neurons in the donor brain. The old neurons stayed. The scientists estimate that it will take a full day for this process to be fully filled. It only takes 5 hours.  A clone of Alice and the conscience of a dead person find themselves stuck together alive alone in the dark. For some time, they just look at each other.

Alice asks, “Who are you?”

The man responds, “Doesn’t matter.”

“Where are we”

“In our mind”

“Well how did that happen?”

“I don’t know about you but I’m being pranked”

“This seems like a cruel prank”

“They did it because I was their organ harvester”

They both went back to being quiet.

“How do we escape?”

“Science and mainly you. Just let me do the talking.”

“Talking to who”

“The scientists”

The scientists use the rest on a giant agar plate on a scale and watch the cells grow. When the plate is full and weighs 1400 grams, they consider it a full brain.

They come back the next day to see their plate. The cells weigh only 400 grams. The scientists are disappointed and worried. They chose to run some tests, and they found that the brain's cells have stopped dividing. Mr. Walters walks in.

“Well boy’s you got the machines working yet?”

“The pure clone brain isn’t finished yet. We are about to turn on Harold. I’m sure he’ll be able to help.”

“Hmm, but Alice is in there too. We’re going to have to calm her. Frog, what should we do?”

“Turn it on Harold will help.”

“You heard him boys turn it on.”

The scientist fired up their machine. In the darkness Alice and Harold saw a monitor glow up. It showed them the room.

“Harold you there?” said Mr. Walters.

“Yes, I’m here.”

“Your orders are to help the scientists. Scientists get talking.” Mr. Walters says leaving but the frog stays.

“So, Harold, we need you to get on your quantum chip and analyze how Alice's growth happened. Basically you need to help us find a way to grow the other brain.”

“Alright I’m just going to do this the simple way. We grow clonal paste. Here’s the DNA sequence you need to activate stem cell state. Then whatever it’ll touch it should mimic and conjoin itself to it.”

The scientist turned off the monitor, took the data, and got to work. They created it in an hour. A slowly growing mass with not identified parameters. The scientists hoped their current plate would set parameters. They brought it over to the agar plate on the scale. They dropped it on it and then the frog with a blade of grass on its back jumped in. The scientist watched in horror as the plate turned into an eternal frog spawner. They run out as a clonal frog morphs into a person and crushes Harold's heart. Alice and Harold see the heart die in front of them and then they see a star slowly fade. Then they find themselves seeing bears as a field of stars. The frogs continue their attack on the compound. They kill the guards on their way to Alice. Who is delirious because she has been psychically aware of all of this the whole time. However, when a figure opened the door, she was relieved. Then she realized it was her. She didn’t question it and just ran out as fast as possible. In the chaos of things no one noticed or could tell which one was the real Alice, or the original frog. She made it to the car and left. She also let the others kill Mr. Bohr and Mr. Walters that she saw in a strange vision. It was by the same blade she had cut herself with. A deep stab into the bottom of the heart. She left heading straight back to Lake Street.

Norman is now only ten minutes away. He saw a coffee shop in the distance and headed in. He got in line keeping his head down. When it was his turn, he ordered and waited. The people ignored him. He sat down and had breakfast while listening to other people. Nothing any of them said stood out to him. He was hoping for something about an eye. He decided he should have tried asking people at a bar. Norman left once he was done eating and started looking for a bar or something that would give him answers. He saw a smoke shop, a store front of a palm reader, and an office. Norman picked the palm reader. Inside he was surrounded by strange baubles and taxidermized animals. In the center was a table with a crystal orb and chairs. A woman came through a beaded door. She sat down and gestured to him to do the same. He sat down. Revealed his hand. She reached to grab them. As this happened Norman saw the scar on her hand. She felt his hands for a moment and then sat smiling with her eyes closed.

Then she said, “You will have a mushroom implanted in your head if you don’t leave with me now.”

“Cool I’m going to do that.”

“What Norman stop it’s me Alice.”

“Ok you sound like Alice, but you have black hair. She's also blonde. Last time I saw her she didn’t have a scar on her hand, and it’s only been a day since I’ve seen her.”

“It’s been a week asshole.”

“You’re crazy.”

Norman got up and left flustered and confused.

While Alice was screaming “No Norman don’t leave me.”

She stopped for a moment and started crying. Outside a man with a top hat strolling by grabbed Norman from the back and pulled him into a limousine. Alice ran out crying and looking for Norman. He was gone.

In the limousine were men in top hats drinking tea. They were laughing and tipsy.

One of them said, “Driver starts swerving.”

The driver sped up and started snaking the limousine.

At this time, one said “Alright boys you ready to go to the strip club.”

They all laughed.

Norman then said “What no strip club. Where’s Alice you goons?”

“Whose Alice?” one said while all of them started to laugh again.

One came over and said “Here, drink this.”

Norman took it said, “Fuck it” and drank it.

They all went quiet. They looked down at all of their phones going off with a text.

“Shit now we have to bring him.”

“God damn it, I wanted to go to the strip club.”

“Driver, stop swerving. Head to HQ”

The limousine stopped shaking. Norman looked to the front and at that moment they put a bag over his head. They grabbed him. In ten minutes, the limousine stopped and Norman heard the door open and he was dragged out. The door opens and closes. They have gone through. They sit Norman in a chair and leave.

A voice says “So, Norman, you want to learn our secrets.”

Normans silent. The man takes off his hood. Norman can’t see his face. What Norman does see is a grandfather clock, a genie lantern and animal bones ordained in gold on a table in front of his chair. There are two doors in front of him. One door has a gold foil sun. The other has a silver moon. In between the doors a blood painted star with an eye and a spiral in the pupil.

The man say’s “Follow me” , opening the door with the gold foil sun.

Norman follows him in. It’s an office of sorts. The man gives him a box of tea and a notebook.

He says, “Drink this and write it will give you answers, you can leave now there’s a limousine waiting outside for you that will take you to an apartment.”

Norman takes the box with him and leaves. He’s greeted by the men with top hats whose faces he can’t see anymore. They open the door to the limousine. Norman looks around and sees people walking around behaving kind of confused. He also sees people who are glowing white and have clothes on. They also don’t have faces. Norman gets in the car. The rest get in and close the door.

One of them says “He wasn’t surprised by the white people.”

Norman say’s “Yeah white people come from Europe jackass.”

Another one says “Yeah and black people come from Africa jackass. Just fucking listen to us as we explain somethings.”

A man holding a manila folder closes it and takes a sip of tea and sighs.

Then he says “Since you already know about the aliens, we are using you as bait since they watched you escape. Still, we need you to work as well since they are acting the same way we operate. That entails meeting people and writing about it. However, first you must write about yourself tonight.”

“Why do I have to do that?” Norman says.

“Just trust us.” He says.

Then the limousine stops. One gets out and Norman follows. Outside there is a gathering of aliens looking at them.

The man turns around and gives Norman a key saying, “you're in room 3 on the second floor.”

Norman goes up and the limousine leaves. The man didn’t leave. He started walking towards the aliens. The aliens all started to run. The man sighs and goes to chase them. Meanwhile Norman is now in his apartment. He goes to the kitchen and prepares some of the tea. When he’s finished, he takes it with him out on the balcony. He takes out the notebook and starts writing. He takes a sip and looks at the moon.

Then he hears a voice say, “Ok I can take it from here.”

He stays out on the balcony in a trance. Then after some time he hears a knock on the door. He gets up and opens it. A woman shoves him, walks in and closes the door. Then she goes to close the balcony. She points at him and tells him to sit down.

She crosses her arms and say’s “Ok Norman listen up; the aliens were trying to assimilate with us they didn’t mean to kill anybody. Their species is like a clonal hive mind. Turns out it’s acidic and killed the group of people that they were talking to. They saw us run and then saw me turn into a brand-new similar thing. Apparently, that is what all the frogs are, and they are trying to explain life is now evolving faster. However, the government tried to contain it but now they keep using ancient curses to hide the people they murdered and end up getting murdered by the curses. The aliens wanted to help clean the curses, so they killed some people. Now you have to destroy their curses. However, you decided to do their worst one. Now you got to work on the inside and spy for me and the aliens.”

Norman went for his notebook and started writing.

“Norman stop it”

“Fine then I guess I’m breaking in tonight.”

“Why?”

“Because you won’t let me write.”

“Fine but I’m going to leave then but meet me at the hotel after.”

“If I don’t make it back.”

“I’ll find you, I'm all over town.”

She handed him a lockpick kit. They went their separate ways. Norman somehow took the most direct route to the building that secretly happened to be back on Lake Street. The street was clear. Currently Norman sees a man in a top hat smoking a pipe lock the doors to an office building. Norman waits for him to leave. When he’s gone, Norman finds himself picking that same door. It opens. He sees the same room as before. He chooses to go to the room with the sun in it. He looks around and finds nothing. He goes to the door with the moon on it. He enters a hallway. Three doors stood before him. One straight ahead, one to the left and one on the right. He goes through the door to the left. He encounters an empty operating room. He decides not to go in. He goes to the door at the end of the hall. In front of him were 3 notebooks on a table in a small study filled with notebooks on the shelves. Norman opened the one on the top. It charted a strange symbol found on the moon. I was the same symbol painted between the sun and moon doors. All around it was fungus growing. It read that later, on the mission to the moon with the help of Nazi’s and NASA they unmooned the fungus and found corpses of aliens were the roots. A group of scientists involved in the project chose to eat the mushrooms. It left them in a trance and eventually mushrooms started popping out of their heads. The Nazi’s encouraged this and kept doing it to people to study them. There were more photos proving this. Norman went for the second one. It read about the man that Alice killed. It explained that they had to write the stories of the victims of their cursed technology to ensure they returned to them the correct face. The last one was about the frogs and aliens. They blamed the frogs on the aliens. Norman collected them and left the room. He decides to open the door that was on the left. Inside are men in top hats. One is sitting down and writing. The other presses on his phone and Norman can now see their faces. Norman runs outside. The men walk out calmly following him. On the street Norman went to run. The men just stood and watched for a moment. Left right straight it didn’t matter he kept ending up at the other side of Lake Street.  The lights went out and it was too cloudy to see from the moon. In front of him a man lit a lighter revealing his smiling face to Norman.

Then he said “You’re ahead of schedule Norman. All you had to do was wait.”

From here they grabbed Norman as he fell to the ground screaming, punching and kicking. A needle stabbed into his neck. Norman started to black out. When Norman awoke, he saw bright lights overhead. Then he felt a sharp pain in his head. He tried to resist, only to find he was restrained. He looked to the right, and he saw the top of his head. The fatty top of his skull covered in blood and hair. From here Norman looked to his left there was a man holding a mirror just so that Norman could see his brain and the fungus being pressed against his head. He realized this whole time the roots were digging in. He slowly felt a loss of control. He started to convulse and then passed out.

He awoke in a dressing room wearing a suit and top hat. Next to him were 5 notebooks. He grabbed them and stumbled out in some random city that he didn’t recognize. He stood looking around. He couldn’t see a single face of the hundreds of people in front of him. Then someone grabbed his hand. It was Alice. Norman could tell by the cut. She dragged him to a secluded area. She took off his top hat. She saw his mushroom and brain.

I'm making my first solo excursion across the pond later this year, and i've started getting a general itinerary together and would love some feedback! I've been to the UK several times with friends (namely, London and Northern Ireland). This is my first time visiting Scotland! 

Is there anything obvious missing from my itinerary? I know I don't have Edinburgh Castle on here, I've read touring inside can be hit-or-miss. Am I missing out by not going?

For day 4, I am considering taking a shorter excursion outside Edinburgh with a tour group, but am also open to just spending more time around the city if there's anything major I'm missing!

A couple notes:

* I have celiac disease, so my dining choices might be a little outside of what is generally recommended -- any suggestions for GF places are very much welcome. (I've been referencing find me gluten free, as well as this article [here](https://gluteninterrupted.com/blog/city-guides/gluten-free-edinburgh), although many of these places seem to be closed permanently.)
* I love bookstores, coffee shops, and just wandering around taking pictures. I am not a big drinker, so not really interested in any pubs or distilleries. 
* Because of my autoimmune issues, I do tire pretty easily, so I'm trying to either schedule some downtime in the afternoons back at my accommodation OR call it earlier in the evening if I've not made it back to rest a bit during the day. (I know it means I'll see less, but I know my limits, ha)
* Most of the times listed on my itinerary are just general times (with a few exceptions, such as the workshop at Islander) -- I don't expect to follow things to a T, but would like to have a general plan for each day!

Thank you all for your feedback! I'm very excited to be back on your beautiful isle. ",1,1755462934.0,uktravel,7,0.6,False

i didn't think much of it at first, because the left side bump quickly went away, and i sometimes bite the tip/sides of my tongue. i thought maybe i had been doing it unconsciously and caused a canker sore or something.

several days later, the tip of my tongue is still very sore, it feels like i burned it with hot coffee and hurts whenever it touches my teeth. today after looking closely i'm realizing i have multiple bumps on the right side of my tongue.

i'm planning on seeing a doctor and getting an STD test, but the only problem is i have a date tonight, Sunday, and the clinics don't open until Monday.

part of me wants to ask to reschedule, but i already cancelled our first date once, and i'd really hate to cancel again and seem disinterested.

if anyone can confirm significant similarity in appearance to an STD, i'll cancel, but i'm worried i'm overreacting and the new sores are from anxiously rubbing my tongue against my teeth or something. 

please let me know ASAP this date is in 6 hrs… or if you don’t know please upvote so it hopefully gets seen by someone who can answer quickly

Healthy food is just a normal food, when we eat varied and healthy food, something homemade, fresh, properly prepared, not something trendy. Our ancestors didn't eat and know about it, they used to eat everything that they had around. You know, like a simple trend and a sense of care, mix macha, coffee in the morning, like a stupid ritual that gives u feeling of control and self-care, people who consume it usually don't love these food and drinks they just temporary follow trends. I think it's not okay to stimulate ur brain, when u wanna sleep just sleep, people have to work overtime and they drink coffee all day on an empty stomach, it's not cool, you want to sleep and you hold yourself. Just imagine that ur car always ride, without cooling down, you just figured out how to fill it up on the go and drive it endlessly.

P.S. Nature can't create something in huge quantities in one place, those who work on coffee plantations get nothing, those who manage them earn pennies and engage in something like slavery even if it's not called like this.

My parents always know where I am because they track my location, yet I’m still not allowed to do simple things. I can’t go to the gym, celebrate my birthday with a dinner out, take pictures, or wear makeup except on Eid. My life is literally just school and work. Nothing else.

Now that I’m in college, I asked if I could meet a few friends at a coffee shop. Instead of saying yes, they threatened to take away my car and even pull me out of school because they think I’m becoming “too Western.”

If you’ve ever sipped a creamy qahwa in a glass-walled conference room overlooking Bahrain Bay, you already understand how this island expertly balances deep heritage with fintech-forward enterprise. My first client visit to the Bahrain Financial Harbour was a lesson in local hospitality—majlis cushions, a taste of cardamom coffee, and a candid chat about the country’s data protection shake-up right as the seafront sun set over Manama. Data localization wasn’t just a regulatory hurdle; it was part of the new business language, and navigating it correctly separated thriving businesses from those stuck in red tape.\
It’s not just the view. Bahrain’s company formation sector is booming, blending old-school networking (you’ll need to master the art of the Ramadan meeting sprint) with modern, cloud-focused regulation. As 2025 dawns, new data localization rules—backed by Forbes Business insights and Reuters market data—impact how every international business operates, budgets, and scales within the kingdom.\
Whether your boardroom sits in Seef District or your main office hugs the Diplomatic Area, compliance is now mission-critical. Here’s the complete, step-wise, and practical answer, born from years of setting up Bahrain companies and wrangling with every new compliance twist.\
\
Alt text: Business professionals collaborating at a corporate meeting in Bahrain., GDP growth is projected at 3.5% this year, outpacing several Gulf neighbors. The kingdom’s pivot towards fintech, logistics, and cloud data hosting is no accident. The Bahrain Economic Development Board (EDB) has streamlined company formation, and the government is actively investing in digital infrastructure centered around Bahrain Bay, Seef District, and the bustling Diplomatic Area.\
\
Bahrain’s new tech parks and regulatory reforms, highlighted in the latest Gulf News sector analysis, position it as the Gulf’s go-to for foreign-owned, data-oriented startups.\
\
Bahrain is now ranked #1 for lowest business costs in the GCC, says Forbes Business, and the incentives for full foreign ownership are attracting record company formation rates.\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting.. Since the latest 2025 update, any international business operating in Bahrain—or processing Bahraini resident data—faces strict data localization mandates** if handling “sensitive personal data” or data relevant to national security infrastructure.\
\
Entities must store specific categories of data within Bahrain’s borders (Article 14, amended PDPL as of January 2025).\
International cloud storage is permitted only if your provider is PDPL-licensed or your data is subject to approved cross-border transfer protocols.\
\
A vital tip: The Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Tourism (MOICT), working with the National Cybersecurity Center, has recently increased random audits and on-site inspections (I was personally caught unprepared during a Seef District client handover last quarter—preparing a digital compliance logbook helped avoid a fine).\
Types of Data Requiring Localization\
\
Sensitive personal data (health, financial, biometric)\
Critical business records per MOICT Circular 2/2025\
Government-related supply chain data\
\
However, general business data (basic HR files, marketing leads) may still be stored offshore—if you secure proper DPAs and notify the Information & eGovernment Authority (iGA).\
Recent 2025 Regulatory Change\
Effective March 1, 2025, the MOICT now requires all new foreign companies to register their chosen data center or licensed cloud provider at the point of commercial registration—failure adds weeks to your licensing and can lead to penalties of BHD 2,500—10,000.\
\
Why Data Localization Matters for Bahrain Company Formation\
Foreign businesses face unique compliance hurdles in Bahrain. Full company formation now involves a PDPL compliance step—integral to the Sijilat portal process—and failure to plan for localization can derail your commercial registration.\
\
""More than 80% of international applicants cite data compliance as the single biggest cause of initial licensing delays."" — Forbes Business\
\
I still remember my first Sijilat submission: I hadn’t set up local data hosting yet, thinking my EU provider would suffice. The application stalled for three weeks until we joined a Bahrain Bay-based co-location facility pre-approved by the EDB.\
\
Business Structures and Entity Types: Cybersecurity Impacts\
Choosing the right business structure isn’t just about taxes and liability—it will directly affect your cybersecurity obligations and data storage plans.\

Cybersecurity and Data Hosting: Entity-Specific Tips\
\
WLLs and Branches are scrutinized for offshore data transfer approvals—in my experience, SPCs fly through if you prepare compliance docs upfront.\
Free zone companies based in Bahrain’s tech parks can sometimes negotiate bulk data center discounts (using a shared agreement—ask at the Tamkeen info desk in Seef).\

2. Application Timing and Document Prep\
\
Best timing: Submit new company applications early in the week—Monday mornings see the shortest Sijilat queues at the MOICT building, especially right after Ramadan.\
Document tips: Pre-arrange your IT infrastructure plan with a stamped cloud hosting contract—MOICT and LMRA now accept digital PDFs but demand original signatures on DPA appendices.\
\
3. Registration: Submit Via Sijilat\
\
Upload your data hosting documentation alongside standard commercial license papers. Double-check that your chosen provider’s license is active for 2025 (I once got flagged for an expired certificate—instant four-day delay!).\
Pay your BHD 50–100 e-registration fee.\
\
4. Post-Approval: Compliance and Cybersecurity\
\
Schedule your mandatory iGA compliance audit within the next 90 days.\
Subscribe to quarterly accounting and compliance alerts—these reminders saved me twice when the LMRA shifted report deadlines with zero advance notice.\
\
Insider Networking Trick\
While waiting for approvals, join a Ramadan lunchtime majlis in Seef—this is where you’ll hear about any “unofficial” MOICT documentation quirks before they go public.\
\
Cost Considerations: What Should You Budget?\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain company formation..\
- Mandatory compliance audits: BHD 500–1,200 annually (outsourcing to licensed firms streamlines renewals).\
- PDPL registration and DPA drafting: BHD 400–800 initial legal setup.\
Pro tip: Bundle your MOICT, iGA, and Tamkeen fees with your annual package from a reputable business center—KeyLink’s pricing guide offers transparent breakdowns.\
Importantly, companies underestimate ongoing cybersecurity insurance: BHD 800–2,500 per year can save vastly more in penalty costs if a breach triggers regulatory fines.\

Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation in Bahrain company formation.. The iGA and MOICT have increased spot checks—especially for cloud-dependent tech and fintech companies.\
Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them\
\
Mistake: Relying solely on overseas IT teams for compliance.\
Fix: Appoint a Bahrain-based DPO or outsource to a local firm with direct MOICT contacts.\
\
\
Mistake: Assuming EDB “fast track” means skipping the data localization audit.\
Fix: Confirm all required DPAs are present at the initial submission—avoid “conditional approvals” that can last months.\
\
\
\
\
Many fall into the trap of informal document translations—always use an iGA-certified translator. During one of my own setup projects, our application was flagged for incorrect Arabic contract language; a quick call to a Seef-based translation office fixed this overnight.\

\
Business Culture: Customs Inside Bahrain’s Regulatory Machine\
Business in Bahrain isn’t just about paperwork. Expect majlis-style negotiation—sitting on low cushions, sharing sweet dates—before any big decision. And during Ramadan, operational hours at the MOICT drop sharply; plan high-priority submissions well before Iftar.\
Traditional coffee service isn’t just for show. Accepting a cup from a local official or lawyer signals respect and often unlocks far smoother processing. (Once, a well-timed coffee meeting at the Diplomatic Area branch office cut our approval wait by four days.)\
Be prepared: many senior admins only meet in the afternoons or after prayer breaks. And relationships matter—your local partner or sponsor can often pull strings when portals glitch or a compliance email goes AWOL.\
\
Why Bahrain Beats UAE or Saudi Arabia for Company Formation and Data Localization\
Surprisingly, Bahrain’s PDPL is less bureaucratic than Saudi Arabia’s new SAMA data rules and offers more flexibility for international cloud integrations than the UAE’s multi-jurisdictional approach.\
\
Faster approval cycles: Bahrain’s Sijilat platform can approve digital-first companies in under 30 days if all localization steps are complete.\
Lower costs: Average legal and compliance fees are 35% less than UAE free zones.\

\
Brief Tangent: Bahrain’s Secret Weapon—Networked Innovation\
At first, this might seem off-topic, but bear with me: Bahrain’s rapid roll-out of free public WiFi across the Seef District and Bahrain Bay isn’t just about convenience. It’s a strategic backbone for the kingdom’s digital economy—and it means that your mandatory data localization set-up can sync, update, and backup in real-time without costly private lines. During a recent compliance rush, this “ordinary” WiFi access cut my audit prep time by a day, letting us submit a clean security review and pass on the first try.\
\
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\
1. Can I store all my business data offshore if I’m registered in Bahrain?\
No. Sensitive personal, financial, and certain regulated business data must remain within Bahrain as per the updated 2025 PDPL. General operational data may go offshore if you file approved DPAs and update the MOICT—review the full commercial registration checklist.\
2. How much should I budget for ongoing compliance and cybersecurity costs?\
Expect to spend BHD 1,500–6,000 per year on data localization, compliance audits, and cybersecurity insurance. Bundling services via KeyLink’s company formation cost guide can offer significant savings.\
3. What’s the fastest way to complete Bahrain company formation with compliance?\
Prepare your IT hosting plan, local DPA, and PDPL documents before the Sijilat submission. Submit on Monday mornings and use the company formation process guide to avoid common hang-ups.\
4. Are there sponsorship or ownership requirements tied to data localization?\
Not directly, but working with a local sponsor can help cut through MOICT bottlenecks and smooth auditing. For most tech or consultancy activities, 100% foreign ownership is allowed. Check which activities qualify.\
5. What are the most common compliance mistakes in Bahrain company registration?\
\
Submitting incomplete DPAs\
Missing iGA-certified translations\
Not registering your local hosting provider up front\
\
For detailed, step-by-step guidance, consult Bahrain business type structures or book a call with a compliance expert.\

Company formation and data localization in Bahrain aren’t just technical checklists—they’re a blend of regulation, business artistry, local hospitality, and strategic shortcuts.

Hi,

Thanks all for your advice on my original posting. After lots of reading and following threads I ended up pushing the button this afternoon on a Bezzera Duo DE that I found on sale in the UK.  Exceeded my original £1500 budget for machine plus grinder by a few hundred, but it looked too good to miss!
So I now need to get on and get a grinder so I’m not sat just looking at its beauty when it turns up in a few days, and looking for more advice.

I’m expecting to drink mostly Cappuccino, Noisette/Macchiato, Cortado.  We do have a Melitta filter coffee machine, but I don’t expect that to get much action once this arrives so definitely the focus is on Espresso, and more traditional roasts.

From reading around plus watching video reviews (especially from Lance Hedrick) I’m currently thinking either:

Timemore 078s - £532
- seems like a well respected grinder for espresso, but can do filter too when needed
- I like the idea that I could change the burrs to SSP or something else if desired in the future, but assume I won’t need to
- have seen various mods to overcome its shortcomings, e.g. the hopper popcorn issue, the grind level indicator
- do I need to be concerned that it’s flat burrs, so not the best for espresso?
- good quiet powerful motor?
- I like the way it looks!

OR Femobook A68 - £600
- conical burrs, which are best for espresso I believe, especially if  I’m looking to recreate my Italian Faema E61 cappuccino from holiday?
- Lance seemed to really like it and scored it an A in a big grinder round up video I saw for performance against price - which sounds good? I don’t know if that opinion is broadly shared though?
- powerful quiet motor?
- seems like it suffers from a lot of static retention?
- less established make, is long term support going to be a concern?

OR Niche Zero - £550
- conical burrs again
- send to have previously been the darling of everyone, but now no longer the undisputed king - but I’m not sure why?
- I’m not 100% in love with the looks but I don’t hate it, and it seems like a really good footprint and probably less likely to cause issues with the wife over counter space!

OR Lagom Casa - £435 (following recommendation from u/mycatsnameisbernie)
- looks pretty cool
- small footprint!
- seems like a really well respected brand?
- get the impression it’s really new? Can’t find any really good reviews on YouTube for it ?
- low power?

Any input gratefully received as before! Trying to be objective, definitely want to focus on getting the best of the coffee we’re going to drink, but then balance good workflow that won’t put my wife off when she needs to make coffee if I’m away.

Obviously if there are any others in that price bracket that I should be thinking about then please shout!  I’m not keen on the idea of something with bellows on top….

# Best Coffee Cups With Lids 2025: Top Brands Reviewed

The quest for the perfect coffee cup with a lid is a journey many embark on daily. Whether you're a commuter, a busy professional, or simply someone who enjoys a hot beverage on the go, a reliable and well-designed coffee cup with a lid is essential. These cups not only keep your drink hot (or cold) for longer but also prevent spills and messes, making them indispensable companions for modern life. With a plethora of options available, ranging from disposable paper cups to high-end insulated tumblers, choosing the right one can be overwhelming. This review aims to simplify the selection process by highlighting the top coffee cups with lids expected to dominate the market in 2025, focusing on their features, benefits, and suitability for various user needs.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a top-tier coffee cup with a lid hinges on several key features. These features contribute directly to the overall performance, durability, and user experience of the product.

**Insulation Technology:** The insulation technology dictates how well the cup maintains the temperature of its contents.

A vacuum-insulated, double-walled stainless steel construction is considered the gold standard for maximizing heat retention. This technology creates a barrier that minimizes heat transfer through conduction and convection. Some cups also incorporate a copper layer between the stainless steel walls for enhanced thermal performance, claiming to keep beverages hot for up to 12 hours or cold for up to 24 hours. Less expensive options might use single-walled construction or foam insulation, which offer significantly less effective temperature control.

**Lid Design and Sealing Mechanism:** The lid design and sealing mechanism are crucial for preventing leaks and spills.

A well-designed lid should fit snugly and securely onto the cup, creating a tight seal that prevents liquid from escaping even when the cup is tilted or inverted. Screw-on lids generally offer a more secure seal than press-fit lids. Many high-end cups feature silicone gaskets or o-rings to enhance the seal and prevent leaks. Some lids also include a sliding or flip-top closure for easy access to the beverage while minimizing the risk of spills. The material of the lid, such as BPA-free plastic or stainless steel, also affects its durability and resistance to odors and stains.

**Material Durability and Safety:** The material used in the cup's construction directly impacts its durability, safety, and longevity.

Stainless steel is a popular choice due to its durability, resistance to corrosion, and lack of chemical leaching. High-quality stainless steel, such as 18/8 or 304 grade, is preferred for its food-grade safety and resistance to rust. Plastic cups, while often more affordable, should be made from BPA-free materials to avoid the potential health risks associated with BPA exposure. Glass cups offer a clean and pure taste but are more susceptible to breakage. The durability of the cup's exterior coating, such as powder coating, also contributes to its resistance to scratches and wear.

**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance:** The ease of cleaning and maintenance is a significant factor for everyday use.

Cups with wide mouths are generally easier to clean than those with narrow openings. Many cups are dishwasher-safe, but it's important to check the manufacturer's instructions to ensure that the lid and other components can withstand the high temperatures and detergents. Some lids have intricate designs with small crevices that can be difficult to clean thoroughly, requiring the use of a bottle brush or other specialized tools. Cups with removable gaskets or o-rings allow for more thorough cleaning and help prevent the buildup of mold and bacteria.

**Ergonomics and Design Aesthetics:** The cup's ergonomics and design aesthetics contribute to its overall user experience and appeal.

A comfortable grip is essential for preventing accidental drops and spills. Some cups feature textured surfaces or ergonomic contours that enhance grip. The size and shape of the cup should also be considered, as some cups may be too large or bulky to fit comfortably in cup holders or bags. The design aesthetics, such as the color, finish, and overall style of the cup, are subjective but can play a significant role in the user's satisfaction.

## Core Benefits

Coffee cups with lids offer a multitude of benefits, enhancing the coffee-drinking experience in various ways.

**Temperature Retention:** A primary benefit is the ability to maintain the desired temperature of your beverage for extended periods. High-quality insulated cups can keep coffee hot for several hours, allowing you to savor a warm drink throughout your commute or workday. This is particularly beneficial during colder months when coffee tends to cool down quickly in regular mugs. The same principle applies to cold beverages, which can remain chilled and refreshing for longer, especially during hot weather.

**Spill Prevention:** Lids are designed to prevent spills, making these cups ideal for travel and on-the-go use. A secure lid minimizes the risk of accidental spills in your car, bag, or workspace, protecting your belongings and preventing messy situations. This is particularly important for commuters and busy professionals who need to carry their coffee without worrying about leaks. A well-designed lid with a tight seal can provide peace of mind and prevent costly accidents.

**Enhanced Portability:** Coffee cups with lids are designed for easy portability, allowing you to enjoy your favorite beverage wherever you go. Their compact size and ergonomic design make them easy to carry in your hand, bag, or cup holder. This is particularly convenient for those who lead active lifestyles or frequently travel. Some cups also come with handles or straps for added convenience, making them even easier to transport.

**Environmental Sustainability:** Choosing a reusable coffee cup with a lid reduces reliance on disposable cups, promoting environmental sustainability. By using a reusable cup, you can significantly reduce your contribution to landfill waste and help conserve natural resources. Many coffee shops also offer discounts to customers who bring their own cups, providing an additional incentive to make the switch. Reusable cups are a practical and environmentally responsible choice for coffee lovers.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about coffee cups with lids:

**What materials are best for coffee cups with lids?**
  Stainless steel is generally considered the best material for coffee cups with lids due to its durability, insulation properties, and resistance to odors and stains. High-quality stainless steel, such as 18/8 or 304 grade, is preferred for its food-grade safety and resistance to rust. BPA-free plastic is a safe alternative, while glass offers a clean taste but is more fragile.

**How do I clean my coffee cup lid properly?**
  Most coffee cup lids can be washed in the dishwasher, but it's important to check the manufacturer's instructions. For lids with intricate designs or small crevices, use a bottle brush or other specialized tools to ensure thorough cleaning. Remove any gaskets or o-rings and wash them separately to prevent the buildup of mold and bacteria.

**Are all coffee cup lids leak-proof?**
  Not all coffee cup lids are leak-proof, but high-quality lids with secure sealing mechanisms are designed to minimize the risk of leaks. Look for lids with screw-on closures, silicone gaskets, or o-rings to ensure a tight seal. Test the lid before using it with hot liquids to ensure that it is leak-proof.

**How long can a coffee cup with a lid keep my drink hot?**
  The amount of time a coffee cup with a lid can keep your drink hot depends on the insulation technology and the ambient temperature. Vacuum-insulated, double-walled stainless steel cups can typically keep coffee hot for up to 6-12 hours. Cups with less effective insulation may only keep coffee hot for a few hours.

1mt1lzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianDating/comments/1mt1lzi/25m_usa_spokane_county/,"25M, USA, Spokane County","Hi! The name's Jack. I'm looking for gals to go on casual dates with for the purpose of pursuing something more serious (gotta get a good read on people before committing). I currently work for a non-profit in town as a donation pick up driver (yes, I see many, many cool things). At least, that's what it says I do on paper, but I do much more than just picking up donations. At the end of the year, I am getting back into EMT work.  
  
I'm always up for a cup of coffee or going out for a drink and a good conversation is always an enjoyable accompaniment to that.  
  
Some of my other interests include:  
Hiking, backpacking/camping, hammocking, baking bread, watching really good movies that provide fantastic discussions (e.g. Shrek, Fiddler on the Roof, Peanut Butter Falcon) \[bad movies such as Birdemic: Shock & Terror or Airplane vs. Volcano are also a pleasure\], sword fighting, having long, solid talks with people, games (tabletop, RPG, and videogames), chess, folk/contra dances, and visiting museums and art galleries.

I'm a bit of a wandering soul, although not by choice. Grew up in China for ten years, then Canada for eight, and then made my way to the US. Never lived in any town longer than 5 years, although I'm hoping to beat my record here in Spokane. My parents were foreign workers in China. I myself grew up in a Baptist family. I made the choice to submit to God when I was in jr. high (summer of 2013), but had always accepted the faith of Christianity as a fact of life. I had a fairly significant deconstruction of my Baptist beliefs in 2023 and reconstruction into something different that I'm not sure how to put words to (not liberal theology just to make that clarification). I've been attending the Anglican church I am currently at for a short amount of time (less than a year), but I've found good people there, been able to have productive conversations about my beliefs there, and find much good health in the life of the Church.

Deal breakers for me are smoking (pipe tobacco and cigars are exceptions), weed, not wanting children in the future (I'd like to be a dad thanks), and having children of your own (but not be a dad that fast). I'd prefer to have a decent amount of crossover in interests, (3 or 4 shared interests) and being able to be outdoors with other people is pretty important to me so it would be nice to meet someone who enjoys being outside.

Looking for people between 20-30 y/o.

I'd be willing to relocate for the right person, but I would really like someone who is able to be a part of my community (as in already nearby)

Having used various types of cold brew machines in the past, I was genuinely curious about whether its bold claims held up in daily use. VINCI promises cold brew coffee in mere minutes—a game-changer for a caffeine-lover like me who can’t be bothered with the traditional 12-24 hour brewing process. My friends, I poured, brewed, and sipped my way through countless cups just to give you an honest take.

**Ease of Use Redefined for Home Brewing Fans**

Setting up the device was almost disappointingly easy. Plug it in, transfer ground coffee and water into the unit, and select your brew strength using the handy dial. The circular brew method, or as VINCI markets it, the ""Circle Flow brewing technology,"" ensures that the beans are evenly saturated without needing manual adjustments. As someone who’s often slightly zombie-like in the morning, this automated process saved me from making those embarrassing spill catastrophes.

**Quality of Coffee Brewed – From Light to Knock-Your-Socks-Off**

The cold brew strength settings—light (5 minutes), medium (10 mins), bold (15 mins), and extra bold (25 minutes)—add some delightful versatility. For casual sipping during work hours, I usually lean toward the light or medium settings. When a colleague sends me a calendar invite titled “Urgent,” the extra-bold brew becomes the hero of my crisis-filled day. Each brew comes out smooth and sediment-free, which was a surprising highlight. None of that gritty residue you’d typically find in less advanced cold brewers.

**Merits**

- Four brew settings to match both flavor preference and caffeine needs  
- Patented brewing tech makes rich-tasting coffee with no sediment  
- Fully automatic operation perfect for multitaskers  
- Doubles as a storage container—keeping coffee fresh for up to 10 days  
- Self-cleaning function keeps maintenance simple     

**Design And Storage Convenience – Streamlined and Thoughtful**

Occupying minimal counter space with its dimensions standing at 7""D x 4""W x 12""H, the Vinci coffee maker feels intuitive and compact—like it belongs. Its inclusion of two lids, one for brewing and another for storage, takes this product up a notch. Pouring directly into the included glass carafe without switching between containers makes you feel like some coffee-loving minimalist.

The 1.1L pitcher is an ideal size for a small household, though it might not cut it if you’re hosting coffee-drinking roommates or live-in family. However, it fits seamlessly into tight refrigerator corners, which is perfect for the weeklong coffee stash.

**Shortcomings**

- Slightly limited pitcher capacity for those who love sharing   
- Doesn't cater to hot coffee brewing needs, meaning it’s strictly a cold brew gadget   
- Cleaning cup feels a tad flimsy  

**Competing Products**

As innovative as the VINCI E23010 appears, it’s joined by competitors like the Takeya Deluxe Cold Brew Maker and Oxo Compact Cold Brew Coffee Maker. Compared to these, VINCI's express brew time is easily a standout advantage neither rival can beat yet. However, for budget-conscious buyers, Oxo's lower initial cost might seem tempting, especially if speed isn't a priority. That said, VINCI undoubtedly takes home the crown for its usability features and tech improvements, like the Circle Flow brewing.

While both the Oxo and Takeya are sturdy, they rely heavily on manual adjustments, which adds a bit of hassle. Considering I value convenience over labor when it comes to brewing coffee, VINCI effortlessly comes ahead in terms of modernity and user-friendly execution.

**True Value for Coffee Lovers**

Though priced slightly higher than some alternatives, this product justifies its cost for its innovation, tech-driven features, and sheer efficiency. The self-cleaning function alone spares hours of manual scrubbing, not to mention its ability to brew on-demand coffee within minutes. It’s neither a stretch for those shifting to cold brew nor too technical for everyday drinkers.

1mt1hic,https://www.reddit.com/r/paloalto/comments/1mt1hic/rental_in_belle_haven_or_rwc/,Rental in Belle Haven or RWC?,"I recently relocated to work at Stanford, and after viewing some rentals I've narrowed my search to two homes (both rooms in a SFH), one in Belle Haven and one in RWC (Centennial). **If anyone here has experience living in either neighborhood, it'd be great to hear what you think of living here!**

For me the pros and cons for these two rentals are:

**RWC - pros:**

* The home is an 2B1B so there's only one roommate, who made it clear that they are very clean and organized. They are passionate about cooking and offer to make dinner for both of us, so I can save time and energy from procuring food
* The living room has windows on opposite sides and is filled with natural light
* Close to Caltrain, food and coffee shops 

**RWC - cons:**

* $1700+/m before utilities feels like on the higher end of rent in this area, hitting the top end of my budget
* Longer commute: 40min bike ride to Stanford vs 25min from the other rental (I don't have a car)

**Belle Haven - pros**

* Rent is almost half (!) of the RWC place
* Closer to Stanford
* Close to the community center with access to free library and cheap gym & swimming pool
* Large house with a lot of (unorganized) common/storage space, fruit trees, etc

**Belle Haven - cons**

* Will be living with the landlords (a young couple who seem nice) and an additional roommate, who will be sharing the bathroom with me. Everyone has very busy tech jobs and it's unclear whether they will be able to keep the home organized 
* The landlords just finished renovation and while they have all the basic necessities, there's still a considerable amount of work to be done to fully set up the home
* There's not much to do in Belle Haven other than going to the community center or visiting the wetland parks (these are nice to have but for me coffee shops are even nicer). More challenging to source groceries/food with just a bike.
* Neighborhood doesn't have the best reputation for safety, but honestly when I visited I felt fine.

For context: the past 5 years of my life have been really hard. My parents are in their early 80s, and their health has declined a lot (multiple surgeries, cancer diagnoses). I’ve moved home several times to help them, and honestly it’s drained me emotionally and mentally. She on the other hand has an avoidant attitude towards her family and I don’t think she ever really understood the dynamic I was going through; she wouldn’t even visit her brother who was on the verge of death multiple times.

My best friend has had her own struggles. She’s clinically bipolar, but she got off her meds and has made some impulsive life changes (like moving cross country because a psychic told her to).

A few months ago, she hooked up with another close guy friend of mine while they were both visiting town (someone I’ve known longer than her that lives in her new city). I told her I was okay with them dating, but I wanted to keep our friendships separate. She’s even called my guy friends “lame” in the past, so it already felt weird.

Since then, there have been several incidents that left me frustrated. For her 40th birthday, she made a huge deal out of it and I ended up spending a lot of money on her plans. She promised she’d be there for my 40th, but when the time came, she only showed up briefly for other reasons (to drop off her cat with her mother as she was going on a trip) and suggested a quick coffee date for my birthday. It felt dismissive, especially compared to what I had done for hers.

When she and her boyfriend (my other long term friend) visited recently, things got even stranger. At a dinner with friends, her boyfriend randomly turned to me and asked, “Why don’t we talk anymore?” out of nowhere. It felt like I was being cornered, and I got really uncomfortable (especially because we never talk except in a larger group chat). Later, she started trash-talking one of our mutual friends — calling him names and predicting his wife would leave him (my best friend left her husband in her 20s so to me she was projecting). Everyone noticed how off the vibe was.

The next day, I confronted her. She tried to play dumb but eventually admitted she had told her boyfriend I was “having a hard time.” That crossed a major boundary — I never wanted him to know personal details like that because that is not our dynamic. By that point, everything she’d done had been piling up: the dismissiveness, the oversharing, the drama, the inauthenticity. I blew up and told her she was fake and needed to stop sending me ChatGPT-generated messages all the time (she uses it constantly for texts and conversations, and it feels so inauthentic). I probably said more in the heat of the moment, but I don’t remember.

We awkwardly hugged before parting, but she made a comment about me being depressed, which felt really weaponized and it dismissed me and my crossed boundaries. A couple of days later, she left all of our group chats and unfriended me from all social media (at 6 am). Now we’re not speaking.

I know she’s struggling and has her own mental health challenges, but I also feel like she repeatedly disrespected my boundaries and put me in situations where I felt cornered. I snapped because of everything that had built up.

However in my case I seem predisposed (per what I've seen from AncestryDNA results regarding uric acid clearance/metabolism etc.), plus bad past habits such as high caffeine and binge alcohol consumption.

Per the AncestryDNA results I do also have a methylation process impairment due to my genes (MTHFR/MTR(R) etc.), and I've had severe low folate and high homocysteine over years of time apparently. I recently attempted to start supplementing to alleviate for that but seems to have triggered things internally such that the flares have become nearly constant and migrating to different areas (both joints and soft tissue). I've definitely had high uric acid labs (9.1 mg/dL latest), but have not been able to get aspiration to confirm urate crystals, though I do have leftover deposits on both of my elbows that seem to be tophi (they do not show up on x-ray, no other testing done on those).

This has all occurred while attempting to eat carnivore as well. Initially I was not 100% strict (my deviations were coffee, diet soda, occasional pickles (no sugar), and dairy). However over the last 3 months I did switch to strict carnivore and still experiencing these constant inflammation flares that seem to be gout. I have discussed with my doctor on starting to take Allopurinol, but I have not told her that I'm eating carnivore (of course she has already told me to cut out/cut back on the ruminant meat). I haven't been able to start the allopurinol since I've not had any non-flare time to begin taking it (apparently it can't be started near active flares).

Just posting again on this about my experience so far, especially since I have been strict, and see maybe someone else has encountered something like this and found a resolution path or something of that nature. I'm not really sure how to proceed at this point and of course given that my doctor is of the usual ""red meat = gout"" variety as well doesn't seem to understand the possible underlying methylation/metabolic issues I have - it's been quite difficult. When the flares are severe, like now, it's about a 8/10 pain level and usually if involving my feet has me unable to ambulate normally. I'm suspecting that my attempts to supplement for the folate/homocysteine issue is what has caused the high frequency, so I will probably have to stop that but I don't know how to address the fact that my folate was <2.0 ng/mL, and homocysteine was 22.3 μmol/L.",1,1755461644.0,carnivorediet,0,0.67,False
1mt1apl,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mt1apl/shots_weigh_too_much_but_have_too_little_volume/,Shots weigh too much but have too little volume [breville esxl800],"I’m new to espresso and have been using a breville esxl800. I’ve been using pre ground la llave coffee. I’m trying to brew a double shot with the 2:1 ratio but I’m not sure where I’m going wrong. When I put in 14-16g of espresso I get a shot that is a bit less than 1.5 oz in 30-40 seconds. However, my shot weighs 40+ oz every time. If I let my shot brew to get a full 2 oz (double shot) the espresso is bitter and is closer to 50 g. Any advice? I don’t currently have a grinder but am looking to purchase a cheap manual one soon.
