So you know what I did. I weighed myself. Logged my weight.

1hptb1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/1hptb1q/a_small_something_i_wrote_to_close_the_year/,A small something I wrote to close the year: Neuromancer at 40 ,"**Starless And Smooth As Frosted Glass: Neuromancer At 40**

*In Buenos Aires the Zahir is a common twenty-centavo coin; the date stamped on the face is 1929. In Gujarat, at the end of the eighteenth century, Zahir was a tiger. In Persia, an astrolabe that Nadir Shah ordered thrown into the sea.*

*Jorge Luis Borges*



In my mid-‚Äô90s, Zahir ‚Äìan object commanding the complete attention of those who cross its path‚Äì was a book written a decade earlier.

*Neuromancer* by William Gibson turned forty last July. It is mostly famous as the most prominent cyberpunk literary work and for coining ‚Äúcyberspace‚Äù (as well as giving *The Matrix* its name and a few other things). Some will say it predicted the internet and the future.

I‚Äôd like to argue that it‚Äôs much more.



*All those brand names, Braun coffee makers, quilted consoles, obsessive attention to what everyone wears.*

*Candace Berragus, review in the scifi fanzine Cheap Truth, 1984*



There is the vividness of the hi-tech dystopian vision, for sure, and ‚Äô80s shticks on steroids that I won‚Äôt even attempt to sample.

But it is also more.

The vividness is also a crispness in perception. What everyone wears is also the things being defined by their relations.

There is futurism and jaw-dropping predictions and high-end street smart. But all this is more. The futurism is also a sustained sense of wonder at the world. The raw street is a healthy pinch of shock and despair.

The future is very lived-in. But it is more. It is a hi-rez connector to a real, shitamachi, life.

There is the point of view overlooking the 21^(st) century, riding with precision the societal gradient of the moment. (Did it get it right? If you‚Äôre saying no, it‚Äôs because you are at neither of the 1% ends; the backdrop wasn‚Äôt describing you.) The technological gradient didn‚Äôt do bad either.

Yes, there were AIs and the struggle of gaining consciousness. The passages sound uncannily relevant in 2024, at least at a level of public discourse, but there is more. The reader is also an intelligence.

Looming above everything else, there is the high-voltage aesthetic. But it is more. Having an aesthetic is also to draw attention to the aesthetics.

Is all that also more than the sum of the parts? For sure. Is this tribute-at-forty doing it justice? Absolutely not.

But there is more.



*Gibson polished his words, files the serial numbers off and weaponises them.*

*reddit user bob\_jsus, 2017*



There is the usage of language.

The nouns that pull up visceral memories. The syntax that rearranges neurons. Density cutting through to thought processes. Chekhov‚Äôs arsenal (at last) flying out a thousand windows.

In Neuromancer the flowers planted by the beatniks and the directness of haiku come together with noir ‚Äì only to be styled by spaghetti western in drapes of city lights. (Come up with *this,* AI, or other intelligence.) Ch√∂gyam Trungpa said about *On the Road* that that was what a buddhist search looks like without the path; luckily the genre was taken forth to blooming and also got its path back.

Without sacrificing cultural influences ‚Äìtons of which I‚Äôd miss in any attempt to list‚Äì and with science fiction as the best line of offense, here is a literary milestone of language penetrating reality. Which comes closer to language shaping the mind than any Wittgenstein could let himself imagine.



*The green-shaded brass lamp cast a circle of light on Deane's desk. Case stared at the guts of an ancient typewriter, at cassettes, crumpled printouts, at sticky plastic bags filled with ginger samples.*



Of course Neuromancer wouldn‚Äôt repeat. As they say, there was only one punk album ever. (However, cyberpunk in general is now kinda mainstream, and although this is easy to see in the aesthetic, it is easy to miss in the semantics: a worldview of tech wonders hand-in-hand with capitalist oppression accelerating to its own singularity was radical and high-killing in early ‚Äô80s; wouldn't call it so radical nowadays.) I‚Äôd like to argue that its historical incisiveness paired with literary significance move Neuromancer beyond era-defining to a classic. Make that a timeless classic; I might have read it before ever getting online and even then Case‚Äôs three whole megabytes of hot RAM was outdated, but a certain lack of self-importance turns such glitches quaint.

All in all, if you asked this fan how Neuromancer has aged ‚Äì it didn‚Äôt really. We are celebrating forty years into its future.",1,1735582026.0,scifi,0,1.0,False

So maybe I'll shoot my shot here:

Original post:
---
My wife and I got along pretty well until we had kids (2 boys, 5 and 3), and now we seem to fight a lot. She tends to expect a lot out of everybody and also has ridiculous standards and then gets angry at me when I can't live up to them.

I've been sick this week which makes the problem 100x worse but she does this regardless of whether either of us is sick.

A few examples: The other morning we both had a day off but we're both trying to get over our sicknesses. She's got a cold and I'm getting over a flu (fever and all). That morning, well before any of us wanted to be awake, our youngest had diarrhea, she woke up and asked me to take care of it. I got up, cleaned him up, put him in his bed with a few toys, checked on the older kid who was sufficiently entertained, and went back downstairs to sleep on the couch (all of our bedrooms are upstairs). Since we're sick I've been sleeping on the couch downstairs (it's just easier when everybody's coughing, tossing and turning). 

Since the boys eventually did get up, she claims I just left them there for her to take care of. I try to explain to her that, no, I tried to buy both of us some time to sleep. She goes in on how we can't just let them sit there hours after they wake up and they need breakfast and you can't just leave them there. She accused me of just wanting more sleep. *Why is that wrong? I'm sick!?*

I try to explain to her that, actually, they won't explode. The oldest can make both of them cereal just fine, and she doesn't need to stress about these things she can send them down instead of working herself up. She tells me that I'm being selfish by not immediately tending to the boys' every whim at the ass-crack of dawn and therefore making it her problem.

She's not having it. But this isn't isolated. She gets this way constantly. This is just the latest.

When she decides it's ""time"" for something to happen, we're on her timetable and I'm delinquent if I need a beat. But god forbid she wants to sleep in and make the kids my problem that's her taking her motherly and well deserved time.

I try to give the kids more freedom and space so that both her and I have room to breathe but whenever I do, she takes over and acts like I left them to be her problem. That's not true and I explain it to her constantly. She feigns ignorance. ""Why didn't you communicate that?"" .. because you were sleeping and I thought we could get more sleep? Like it's an impossible question. 

I feel like I'm always on edge because if it's not *her* way, I'm somehow violating her.

I'll spend an afternoon cleaning the house and when she comes home she'll tell me the house is a mess and start re-mopping areas I've already mopped that day, because inevitably there's a new smudge somewhere because we have two young boys in the damn house. She'll always use the phrase ""total mess"" which deflates me. It doesn't matter how much I do I somehow never do it right or well enough.

If I showed her this post she'd immediately tell me that actually I'm lazy and I don't really do anything. Then she'll start trying to compare all the things she does for us and the family and I keep trying to tell her maybe don't fucking kill yourself over everything, life will wait.

She used to come home sometimes and see dishes in the sink. She wouldn't even take off her jacket or say hello before starting on dishes. She'd give me a cold shoulder like I left dishes for her- even if I had planned on doing them later. It doesn't cross her mind that when I pick up the kids at night, make them dinner, get them in bed, that by the time she gets home I might want 5 fucking minutes to sit down before getting elbow deep in dishes. She'll say she ""doesn't do that anymore"" and I guess she doesn't since I had such a long fight over her doing this that she's finally backed down. But it's an example of where she's coming from.

If something comes up in her mind, it's an emergency that everybody should have already tended to, and how dare we leave it for her. The problem is there's no end to emergencies. 

I don't dispute she does more around the house than I do, but that's because she doesn't fucking sit down or rest or have hobbies she just fucking won't stop.

Any time I want a nap or time to myself she gives me guilt like she's the one making all the sacrifices. (Mind you finances are not evenly split by a long shot, I pay the mortgage, utilities, internet, oil). She tells me that split doesn't count because she has the kids more. she works 32 hours a week and has the kids when she's not working. I work 40 hours a week and have the kids when I'm not working. 

When she's not home, it's like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I can give the kids activities and then relax without wondering about what task I forgot to do or didn't do right.

Yesterday morning she vented that she wanted to go a day without cleaning ""shit"" off the toilet because the kids are sick now too. Diarhrea every few hours. I explain that if she's at her witts end, that she doesn't need to clean the toilet every 12 minutes and that she can just let us be sick for a day and we can clean the toilet later in the day since they're just going to poop again.

She looked at me like I had 3 heads. ""You can't have a poop on a toilet, why won't you just clean it?!?!"" and I was like ""wait I never said I wouldn't clean it, I was saying maybe stop making everything an emergency...?""

She cannot communicate without underhandedly insulting me. ""It's a mess in here"" = ""why haven't you cleaned."" 

When she got up yesterday, she asked (demanded) I give the sick child a shower. I knew he was gonna poop again in minutes, so I took the sick kid back upstairs and we laid down for a while. Figured I'd throw him in the shower when I take mine. She got mad that we were resting, and left to get coffee without offering me one (which is her passive agressive way of telling me, once again, I'm not living up to her ridiculous standards). Why was the shower an emergency? He didn't have shit on him. Oh, because I decided it wouldn't be a bad idea for him and I to get a little more rest at 8 in the morning, and so now the world was *her problem*. That's the emergency. 

This morning, I called her about something and asked how she was feeling. She told me that there's ""shit everywhere"" in the house. Yeah, they're christmas presents. Most of which she got (and I think she got too many, so why is she **** at me!?). She says ""Well why didn't you put it all away?"" as though I wasn't sick with a fever this week, barely able to get out of bed. As though I didn't do a deep clean of the kitchen and dining room just the day before, handwashing dishes, mopping floors, doing 3 loads of laundry. No- I didn't find new hiding places for the hundred christmas toys she bought and now that's my fault.

How do I communicate with her? This is beyond ridiculous.

TL;DR: My wife gets instantly stressed about things which creates emergencies that she then offloads onto me and holds them against me when I don't manage them immediately. Whenever I leave a vacuum whether in chores or giving the boys space, she immediately takes it up as though I've left it for her. How do I communicate?",1,1735581756.0,Parenting,0,1.0,False

OH MY GOODNESS! What is this? A LIVE ACTION REMAKE OF THE BARNYARDS? Because it sure SEEMS LIKE IT with how yall losers be acting ü§£

In fact what is this? A crossover episode featuring Patrick Star from SpongeBob and Vicky from Fairy OddParents! OH NEVERMIND! Those two are more bearable than yall ever will be. Patrick is much smarter and Vicky is much nicer! That means allot and isn't good for yall üíÄ

As for Vicky. It's perfect for how rude yall be. Except Vicky at least had a time or few she was GENUINELY nice. Where as some of yall are ""nice"" when with friends and/or family. Or when like the manager shows up. But yall are beyond mean and Entitled at times. 

Do I see a crown on you? No! Are you getting fed a grape by a butler every often? No! Does this place look like a castle? No! üíÄ

Sorry Lil Bro but whatever you want in life ain't handed to you on a golden plate. It's earned. We ain't gonna have cheaters in this game called life! Nobody likes cheaters. Same goes to fakers-Someone who lies. Which I am curious as to why some of yall lie about who you are! Why do you act nice when with others who know you and show your true colors otherwise? What's wrong? No Balls? 

""Bok bok bok"" what's that I hear? Sounds like chickens. That's right that's all I hear from yall! A bunch of üêîs. Pretty good impression if you're trying to be one of the Hens, Chicks, or Roosters in the live remake of the Barnyards yall clowns wanna be apart of so much!

[Patrick was at least easier to train. ](https://youtu.be/BhSEXdQHwBE?feature=shared)

The whole ""The Lid' thing, he got it. When I give directions I can tell some of you clowns aren't listening. Because I'm now starting to learn the difference.. The difference between helping and teaching you and me just doing it for you, no matter how clear the instructions are and how slow I go. Back then I questioned it but now I know the truth. Like I'm not helping you scan produce as in teaching you. I'm doing it For yall. üíÄ

Same thing be happening with some repetitive questions like ""Where's the bread?"" or ""Do you have <item>"" or ""Do you take tap?""

Hate to burst yalls bubble... But Walmart ain't a roguelike üíÄ

The store doesn't randomize each and every time you enter it,  unless there's a remodel then there will be signs warning of the remodel. 

Until then if Bread is in like A11, it'll always be on A11. It's not gonna be on A11 Day 1 then A17 Day 2! Wanna know why? Because WALMART AIN'T A ROGUELIKE. It's a STORE. 

Bread will be where bread was the first time you came in. If we don't sell a set item WE'RE NOT GONNA SELL IT THE NEXT DAY. Finally... No Tap to Pay. No Google Pay. No Apple Pay. No Samsung Pay. NO TAP. Only cash, card, and Walmart Pay. Checks go to a human register.

But it's really tiring giving you the same instructions over and over again, perhaps I should give them to your smarter friend!

Other stupid questions... ""Are you open?"" ""I dunno let me check my light!"", ""Is that Self Check available?"" ""I dunno let me check if the screen is up or the light"" ""Cash?/""Card?"" ""I dunno let me check the screen and/ the sign"", ""Do you work here?"" ""No, I wear this vest for fun!""/""Let me make sure I didn't forget my vest""

But that aside I have a request. If you know or feel like you're gonna need your hand held at SCO ALL THE TIME and the option is open...

# PLEASE

and I'm begging and can't sweat this enough

# GO WAIT IN THE HUMAN CHECKOUT

There's a time and place for everything but going to SCO intentionally when you know you'll need your hand held... Not the brightest or nicest move. Not really rude but it's not cool. It's called SELF Check for a reason you Clods. It's in the name so comprehend it. 

If its that the line is to long and I don't really have anybody over I'll make an exception if need be. But if like You target lock onto me and charge FULL STEAM AHEAD like a Koopa on steroids and ignore some open lanes... Really lil Bro? Trying to act like this is fucking Pokemon! 

 DUN DUN DADA DUN DUN DUN

Awareness Level like that of a trainer in Pokemon. The first Associates you see you charge straight at em, ignoring everyone else. Seriously üíÄüíÄüíÄ

That's dangerous-Jokes aside. Sometimes lanes are open and they are ignored but you're gonna get somebody hurt because of your insolence. Like today I witnessed someone IN FRONT OF A STOCKER and they only saw THE SCO HOST.  Ignored 3 stockers and cashiers to go down an aisle to have the Host find half there list AND ring them up, ignoring the others. Yall complain about jobs getting taken yet yall go and do this. üíÄ

I sure do wonder who's REALLY responsible for ""US not having jobs"" . . .

It's one thing for small questions and again wanting to learn or unintentional errors like Mis Scan or if we gotta approve a void. But you crossed the line if I gotta show you every thing like scan your items and do your payment and such. 

But most importantly please pay attention. It's literally free to pay attention! Don't tell me you can't afford to pay attention yet you can afford groceries. It's easy to. I'm not asking for allot-No... WE aren't asking for much. 

Just... Do whatever it is you need to do BEFORE you go shopping. Take your medication. Drink your coffee. Whatever it is, do it before coming here. Nobody wants a ball of rage and we ain't a therapist, we ain't a babysitter. We certainly are not a squad of Palookas 

AND WE ARE ESPECIALLY NOT ROBOTS. You really think corporate can afford that or WANTS TO üíÄ

About 21 Million Walmart Workers... A robot can cost over $30000. That's gonna be at least $50 Billion. Look at how shitty are tech is you buffoons.

Do you really think they'd spend money on that if they don't even have TAP!

Oh and for you speciaw wittwe entitwed stawchiwdewen who want to tap to pay SO BADWY. OH YOU'RE GONNA HWAVE A WITTLE WITTLE MEWTDOWN WITHOUT IT

I have a guide for you. 

Locate your nearest Government Facility, Post Office, or Library.

Gather all legal Identification and Documents of Identification. You're basically going through the process to get your passport 

In the meantime research areas in Canada where there are Walmarts and a good place for a good income and such. 

Basically... Move to Canada and then question your choice. Was it worth it moving to Canada? Just so you can use those special payment methods? Is it worth it? When you could have just used Walmart Pay üòë

Yall fools better watch how you act. Even Jack Horner has STANDARDS. Slavery has been abolished long ago you imbeciles! So stop treating us like peasants if you know what's good for you!

It's a shame yall think yall can get away and are allowed to act like this in a grocery store. Well yall can bring corporates golden star child. 

Next Point: ***IF YOU NEED HELP LET US HELP YOU***

I'm so tired of getting body blocked when I'm trying to help you. Allow us to help you if you need it and don't get mad at us.  Yall seriously need some anger management classes, OH WAIT YOU'D SCARE EM OFF ü§£ü§£ü§£

""Sorry Lil Bro with how angry you get for the smallest of reasons!"" üíÄ

Seriously things are out of our control. Astral something is the term. Getting mad because of something beyond one's control.

Like yall get mad when Walmarts busy... IT'S A WALMART Lil Bro. You're not complaining but complementing us in a way. Imagine getting mad at your own kind for coming in üíÄ

What is this? Customer 1 and Customer 2? You trying to be Otis from The Barnyards for the live reaction remake? Because Main Character Syndrome won't get you the role!

Same thing goes to getting mad when there is no electric scooter! What do you want me to do? Speak an incantation in some ancient language and summon one from another dimension? What the heck do you think this is? A crossover of Harry Potter? I ain't gonna do some wizardy and witchcraft shit to summon an electric scooter because you don't want to wait, you didn't come here sooner, and/or toy refuse to go to another Walmart close by instead they may have one as a last resort. üíÄ

I ain‚Äôt gonna summon shit or pull whatever you want out my ase because yall be more lazy then Snorlax. Like you don't wanna take the few extra minutes to go to Money Center to break a bill and you get mad when I can't pull $5s and $1s out my ass so you can break a $20 at SCO or in the middle of the aisle. Yall really think yall are very special but you're just a fool playing entitled üíÄ

Speaking of money at SCO... The machine ain't gonna take Cash you wipe your ass with or whatever torture you put your card through it won't go through at all. Make sure you use good money and a good card. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH BEFORE WALKING IN. 

If its an item I can reach I'll go grab it but there's only so much we can do. I can't manifest an out of stock item from thin air!

If I had such powers I'd be in a government facility. 

Some of you Clods be the most impatient people, snapping your fingers and such WHEN I'M NOT THERE IN 0.5 SECONDS! Jeez yall... A child on sugar ready to see Spiderman has far more patience then you ever will. Calm your head Lil Bro I'll be there when I'm done helping out who I'm helping and keep in mind I GOTTA SAFETY WALK. 

If you're so inpatient that you're rushing me and I get hurt like by a cart, you're paying my hospital bill ;)

But just be patient-_-

You ain't Otis from the Barnyards 

Watch how you get our attention for help and to it

You are not to whistle or snap at us. Does it look like I have a fluffy tail growing out my ass? Do you really think I'm gonna sit if you command me to? Do you think I'm gonna go fetch a stick or a tennis ball if you throw it? Do I have floppy ears? Do I eat food off the floor? No should be the answer to all these? Why? Because I'm not a fucking dog. I'm not a furry so stop treating me like one üíÄ You'll only have permission to do that if I'm wearing a dog suit which I never will and none of us will

New Character in a Fighting game or the live action remake of Barnyards?

As yall be more focused on practicing for a FIGHTING GAME with yo ""Get Over Here!"" Side Taunt lookin ass. You ain't Scorpion! You ain't Falco! I certainly won't show you my moves  because you ain't Captain Falcon üíÄ

You better not do it more aggressively unless you wanna pay a hospital bill, doing it so. Doing it with such force you gonna slap someone. Save your rage and side smash for your punching bag. 

Finger Wiggling is the same thing except you ain't in a Spy Film. I don't hear Mission Impossible. There aren't any lasers. So take your subtle wanna be James Bond shit elsewhere. 

Hand Raise is okay if I'm struggling to find you like at SCO. A subtle hand raise and small wave is okay. 

But Waving nonstop. Are you practicing miming being a window cleaner? WELL YOU ARE DOING A SHIT JOB. 

ONLY IF I'M STRUGGLING ARE YOU ALLOWED TO WAVE. It's really rude to wave for no reason like really rude. Like dear lord Sonic in the shows is better, the ""I'm Waiting"" will be funnier and better then you all

Staring and Waving you stoidi do at the wrong time. What if our back is turned? We don't have eyes behind us. So stop waving if we can't see it. Don't be the reason someone tries to add more eyes to themselves and things go wrong... Remember what I days about robots? Upgrades to are expensive :)

So shit goes wrong you paying a bill ;)

Batting your hand at me or grabbing me or pulling my clothing. YOU AIN'T A CAT. Get that furry cat shit outta here.

ALSO PERSONAL SPACE YOU FOOLS. Some of yall small like Muscle Mans bathroom after he takes a shit and a breath that makes a dragons smell clean. 

A Excuse Me will do or at SCO use the button and not this heratic ways you heathens. The sooner we can help you is the sooner you actually behave in a store.

Also overall please stop ignoring us. No wonder not allot of us greet anymore just to be ignored. Acknowledge us back ffs!

This goes with letting us help you. If I'm with someone and I let you know I'll be there for you. Don't come get me. Have PATIENCE people. It's not it fault yall got potatoes growing from your ears

Also WORDS. Use them. No voice/ no words, minimal service.  Treat us like an AI well you'll get it back. What goes in comes out. 

If you have a question take the 2 extra seconds to word it like one. You sound dumb going ""Crackers"", like what do you mean by that ü§®

I'll answer to a ""Where is"" but not just the item name. Remember what I said about robots price.

So watch your words AND your volume

Darth Vaders breathing is louder then you. Mumbling your question then shouting it like a Saiyan word who had no battle. Check your privilege and take anger management courses üíÄ

I don't how what fetish or kink yall have but this targeting thing needs to stop..Targeting as I mentioned earlier with this fool ignoring an armada of associates. What about that associate are you obsessed with ü§®

In some cases it can even be seen as bullying to. Like knowing that associate will submit to your whim and taking advantage of that is bullying like how could you not know that ü§£

Stop stealing peoples jobs, Snorlax. Go the 3ft and ask the dude with the vest and don't obsesse over a specific associate you freaks.

Read the fine print to you weirdos. Quit being pigs and pay attention. A bat in a cave can see more then you!

So tonight while video chatting with my kids- my 3 year old was running around showing me my old dog. I dont know why. Some background, he lives in the house we shared as it is on his familys property. Its a 4 bed, massive house. I live in a small 3 bed flat. I have the kids 70% of the time. He gets them 1 day a week and every other weekend (100% his choice). 

While running around to show me the dog I saw his kitchen. He has all these new fancy appliances. I am happy for him. It just broke me a bit tonight, as I had to ask my sister today if my kids and I could move in with her. Meaming we will share a room. 

I am not making nearly enough money to support me and my kids. I tried but my rent is almost as much as my salary. He does pay maintenance but honestly it barely makes a dent. I know comparison is the thief of joy. But man it is hard. 

I always thought men had it bad with divorce and I do believe that a lot of the times they do. I never wanted that for him but also never wanted it for me.  I always heard no one wins in divorce. He did. He is financially better off it seems. He miraculously has more money all of the sudden. I am not exagerating. Its quite shocking actually. 

I cant sue for more maintenance, long story, but in my country there is a chance that I could get less than I am getting now. Which is insane but alas. 

I have applied to every and all jobs. My country has a 57% unemployment rate so it is tough out there. I know this will pass. I know It will get better. I will get a job that pays more and I will eventually be able to afford a house and food. Its just taking a bit of time. 

Its just seeing the fancy coffee machine when I cant afford food broke me. Okay, I just wanted to get this out so I dont spiral. Rant over.",3,1735581621.0,Divorce,0,1.0,False

**My (28f) boyfriend (31m) creates comic books about our arguments instead of apologizing and it has become unbearable.**

[Original Post - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5mz350/my_28f_boyfriend_31m_creates_comic_books_about/)  **Jan 9, 2017**

So my boyfriend and u have been together for nearly theee years, let's call him Bobby. Bobby does have a condition that I won't name but you'll probably be able to guess at with context. Recently he lost his job and started to turn in on himself a bit and it has worsened his condition. I give him a lot of slack with emotional issues but this has really gone to far.

Bobby has always had a dream of becoming a famous comic book writer. He draws and writes a series ( let's call it Wondergirl). And he's actually really good! He has created 20 instalments and is hoping to be published one day. He uses me to soundboard ideas and I am usually the first to see his stuff.

Here's the problem; I'm pretty sure he has been turning our fights/issues into plot devices as a way to apologize for things. He has been working on these comics since before we met but once we started getting serious it looked like the main character (Sam) started to become more like me. I don't want to sound being but Sam used to be this super intense, take no shit kind of girl but now enjoys painting and reading in cozy coffee shops, which are two of my hobbies. She's also started to look a bit more Asian just like me‚Ä¶.Bobby and I have always enjoyed taking some time each day to update each other on our lives and he usually updates me on what's happening in the story. Recently several big issues of ours are becoming plot devices, here are some;

1. My sister just had a baby but I've been unable to meet her. Bobby and I moved to Florida for the job he ended up loosing (they down sized so it wasn't his fault). I was really bummed about it but there was no way we could afford to go to Montana. He got a little annoyed at my mopping, he's an only child with distant parents so he doesn't get the importance I place on family. His basic argument was that he is supposed to be my family now and if I save up I can go visit eventually so he couldn't understand why I was upset. A week later Sam has a side plot where she finally accepts that her brother Rick is dead and can't be brought back but is happy she still has her girlfriend Angela who is her new family. He gave me this big speech about how Sam doesn't let the past hold her back and just keeps her focus on what is really important.

2. I was molested by my dad as a kid. Bobby knew this since about a year into our relationship. Before we moved in together I had actually thought I was mostly over this. Now though we have sex a lot more often and it turns out I'm not as over it as I thought. A few months ago I tried talking to him about this. Mostly I was saying certain things were difficult for me such and being held down or having sex from behind. I said these things weren't now a hard no, mostly just that it can't happen suddenly and I need sweet talk instead of dirty talk if we do stuff like that. The point totally WHOOSHED over his head. He started by saying I was trying to tell him he was bad in bed, switched to me just trying to make him the bad guy in the relationship (I crashed our car a few days before and he thought I was trying to one up him) and at one point said I was ‚Äòpolitely‚Äô trying to accuse him of raping me. It got so stressful that I ended up apologizing for springing it on him just to get him to shit up. I was pretty pissed, I actually nearly dumped him over it but calmed down when I realized that it is probably a little nerve wracking to be told your girl friend has rape flashbacks during sex and you never noticed. I was going to bring it up in a few weeks and give him one more chance.

BUT THEN GUESS WHAT?! It turns out that the mysterious secret Sam has been hiding about her superhero mentor is that he molested her. Bobby went on and On about how well it fit, that that exaplains pretty every single one of her issues and that she obviously still blames her self. It was revealed when Angela jokingly chockes her a little and Sam freaks out and then goes into this long flash back. So I basically sat there, shocked, listening to him describe these horrible rape stories similar to mine and give all these ‚Äò'poor sam‚Äô statements. It actually hurt extra because of how sweet and tender Angela was to Sam considering when I tried to talk to Bobby about this he acted like I was the bad guy. I also hated the maybe implication that I blamed myself for being raped by an adult and that any negative emotions I ever have stem from that and not, for one example, his own douchbag behaviour.

3. The last example. Bobby is pretty easy going 99% of the time. However in certain situations he can just loose it. This usually happens when his schedule is changed too much or his in a room that is expenctantly loud and crowded. He's not violent at all but will have a bit of a melt down. When we were shopping at target a few weeks ago we got stuck in a big Xmas shopping crowd and when he asked for his chewing gum (he uses it to distract himself in these situations) I realized we forgot it. He completely looses it. He screams at me at the top of his lungs, claiming I forgot it on purpose and that I did it because I don't love him and at one point just collapses onto the ground. I ignore his behaviour and walked over to a store to get more gum. It was actually not a huge deal for me because I work with children with his condition so I can tune it out pretty well and it has only ever happened two times. I expected an apology but instead the next day he shows me the latest script for his comic book. It had Angela also having a big melt down (worse than bobby‚Äôs) but Sam understanding her tortured past and loving her anyways. He said something like ‚ÄòSam knows that Angela doesn't mean to be like that, she wants to be normal but can't help it. Sam loves her anyways and Angela loves Sam so much, it hurts her when she hurts Sam.‚Äô

The problem with all this is I never get an actual apology for any of this! I don't even know if this is actually the best way he can communicate his feelings or if it is all just a coincidence. For all I know he still thinks that I tried accusing him of rape to deflect me getting into a wreck and the Sam thing is just juicy plot thing. But I keep avoiding talking to him about it. Right now I think it's likely he is trying to communicate the best way he can and I don't know what I'd even do if it turned out he thought everything he did was okay. Our relationship is okay when it's the first situation but is seems practically abussive if what he's saying is ‚Äò sexual life is more important than your emotional wellbeing so sit and listen while I describe graphic rape scenes.‚Äô

Does anyone have any advice on what to do here?

We have very different styles: I don't care much about my place but I really need to have my alone time and my reading time every weekend. I got a PhD and used to live in already furnished places for most of my life. That means that on the weekend my partner wants to grocery shop and clean first thing while I want to recharge and read quietly after a long and tiring week. If I go in the second bedroom I know he will interrupt me so I tend to escape to coffee shops. I also tend to shop regularly based on what I need rather than do a big trip. 

As it created some friction in our relationship we got some help with cleaning. But he still tend to rely on me for cooking since he does fix things in the house...which is a bit unfair because fixing stuff happens occasionally while cooking happens everyday. 

Last week there was his sister and after she left I decided to spend the day out going to coffee shop and just walking in the city. He took that as a sign that I was avoiding him. Then I said ""don't worry I'll go back to reading in the room"" to which he replied ""well it's not your room, it's a shared office for both of us"". 

I have to confess that I've been working a lot lately and we haven't spent much time together but as a hardcore introvert I do need my alone time (regardless of wether we spent time together or not). I love him and I do see a future with him but I don't want to feel responsible for another human (aside from kids if we decide to go for it) and that's how I feel sometimes.

It‚Äôs my first step toward independence, and I‚Äôve really been enjoying it‚Äîuntil recently. One of my coworkers, who‚Äôs a 26-year-old guy, has been making me feel super uncomfortable. He‚Äôs always really flirty, telling me how ‚Äúmature‚Äù I am for my age and how I‚Äôm not ‚Äúlike other 18-year-olds.‚Äù At first, I thought I was overthinking it because he‚Äôs naturally friendly with everyone, but lately, it‚Äôs felt like he‚Äôs crossing a line.

For example, he found out where I go to school and joked about ‚Äústopping by to make sure I‚Äôm focusing on my studies.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt funny to me. Another time, I accidentally spilled coffee on my shirt during work, and while I went to grab a new one, he made a comment like, Too bad it‚Äôs not my shift to clean up messes. I didn‚Äôt even understand what he meant until one of the older women I work with rolled her eyes and mumbled something about men being gross.

I‚Äôve tried to brush it off, but last week he waited for me after my shift and offered to drive me home. I said no, but he laughed and said, Don‚Äôt be so weird about it; I‚Äôm just being nice. I knew I‚Äôd feel bad walking past him, so I stayed behind and waited for him to leave before heading home‚Äîwhich made me late for a family dinner. My mom got annoyed, and when I tried to explain, she said I was being dramatic and assuming the worst about him. She told me to just be polite and not think every guy is a predator.

Now I feel stuck. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm blowing this out of proportion or if my instincts are right. Should I talk to someone at work about it? Or will I come across as immature and paranoid?

I started loading about 3 years ago, and I never made it out of the loading phase. I never thought it could go this far. First it was me, then my wife, and for the past year, the kids.

I just stepped out of our bedroom after a 4-day bender. I accidentally ripped the door off the hinges. My wife and I have broken probably every piece of furniture in our bedroom, and the drywall is stripped from the studs in most places. There's a constant powdery residue dusting the air, and I'm not sure what day it is anymore.

I'm looking around my house, the kitchen counters have lost their shine covered with a soft powdery layer of white dust, my two-year-old, in the corner, just bench pressed the coffee table and he's moving on to choking out the dog. My oldest has moved out of the house. He's started some sort of underground fight club, and he's only 12. My dog can't smell anymore. His nose, once black and wet, now resembles dry ice. My 2 girls are making snow angels on the tile floors.

How did we get here? I feel like it's all too much. Are we in too deep?

On top of everything, I'm pretty sure my wife is pregnant, but we can't really tell through her massive chest and abs. The only reason I think she might be pregnant is because I had my head on her belly, and I felt a hell of a kick. I'm deaf in that ear now. It was either that or she just flexed a little too hard, I'm not certain. 

Before I head back into the bedroom, I just wanted to hit you guys up and see if anyone had answers. Can creatine use affect the baby? How and what do we expect? They don't really have a ""What to expect when you're expecting (Creatine edition)"" if you know what I mean. I don't really plan on stopping, and I don't think my wife does either.

There's still a bunch I want to explore, they ended up being my highest hit rate house next to Pineward. Sawmill in particular did something RIGHT to my brain and awakened my love for oil notes. It's so unique yet so soft and palatable. Let me know your favorites or if there's anything you think I need to try based on my hits!

**Black Forest** *(Agarwood, Nagarmotha EO, Tobacco Absolute, Dark Chocolate, Milk Chocolate, Cocoa Absolute, Maraschino Cherries, Black Cherries, Hay Absolute, Sandalwood EO, Whipped Cream & a drop of Pink Peppercorn Essential Oil)*: Holy chocolate covered cherries! Dark, sweet, syrupy. It isn't bad but with every passing minute I'm growing more fearful this will be a straightforward, sugary gourmand on my skin. Mild spice and woods creep out after a few more minutes and give me hope. The musky, woody quality eventually reaches it's full potential and it was worth the wait. (The agonizing 10-15 minute wait.) It still teeters on the edge of too sweet for me, but the fruitiness becomes barely noticeable and the chocolate mixes beautifully with the wood.¬† **7/10**
  
**Blossom Jam Teacakes** *(Southern Tea Cakes, Petit Fours, Floral Infused Jams & Preserves and a Delicate Aroma of Tea)*: A blast of jammy sweetness. Sugary in a sticky, fruity way. Florals that are in no way the main focus but help create a light, playful blend instead of cloying cake and mounds of fruit. This is fun and girly. Warm childhood days eating fruit and playing dress up. Not for me. Nostalgic. A more authentic version of smells I remember from glittery elementary school sprays and lip gloss. **3/10**
  
**Camp Willow** *(Campfire, Fir Balsam, Spruce, Pine Needles, Black Coffee, Vanilla Pipe Tobacco, Marshmallow & Bourbon)*: Delightful chocolate and woods! Within a few minutes, the chocolatey element evolves into something dark, rich, syrupy, spiced, caffeinated. Smoky and slightly woody. This is genuinely reminiscent of enjoying treats while camping. An extremely tasty atmospheric. Once totally dry there's a creamy, marshmallowy quality and it's such a wonderful pairing with their campfire note. **8/10**
  
**Farmhouse In Fall** *(Sugared Sandalwood, Wood Smoke, White Sugar, Shortbread, Toasted Marshmallow, Leaves, Fall Air, Chamomile, Pear, Clove, Nutmeg, Hay)*: It opens with a spiciness that reminds me of autumn decorations in the seasonal aisle of department stores. This becomes less prominent as it dries. I feel like wisps of smoke are floating by me in crisp, autumn air. There's a sweetness that feels toasty and crumbly as opposed to gooey and cloying. Despite sugar, smoke, and spice, it has a bright coolness to it? This is an enjoyable fall atmospheric. There's still a light seasonal decor/fall candle vibe about thirty minutes after spraying this on my skin, but it becomes pleasant and complementary within the naturey/smoky/sweet blend. My boyfriend said it feels like wandering around AC Moore while the autumn wreaths are hanging up. **7/10**
  
**Farmhouse In Summer** *(fresh cut grass, creamy gardenia, sun-dried linens, country air, sunshine, sunflowers, approaching summer storm)*: I'm blown away by the accuracy of the grass and gardenias. There's a clean, soft, fuzzy linen feeling in the background. A whisper of rain in the air. This is almost a light and clean scent but I feel like I tossed a freshly washed picnic blanket into dirt and wildflowers just as storm clouds rolled in. I'm really not fond of floral-forward scents but this is done so well that it's growing on me. My boyfriend said it's ‚Äúa farmhouse in summer on steroids‚Äù and it smells like potent grass, flowers, and mustyness. **6/10**
  
**Gibbon's Boarding School** *(Dusty Wooden Desks, Paper, Carefully Hidden Tobacco Pouch, Dying Fire, Dried Leaves, Leather Chairs, Autumn Breeze)*: At first it's simply equally sweet and musty. As it dries I smell something warm and spicy which I think is the tobacco? Hints of leather, wood, and paper mingle in the background. They provide a general sense that you're sitting in a fancy study more than they are obvious perfume notes. Surprisingly light and airy, for some reason vaguely fruity to me. Well done and realistic, but not my favorite thing to wear. You're cuddling in a cozy library with an autumn breeze flowing through the windows. My boyfriend said this is well-blended, he has to work to pick out specific notes, but the leather is really nice. **6.5/10**
  
**Island Blackstrap** *(coconut, dark rum, pineapple, sugar cane, simple syrup, blackstrap molasses, caramelized sugar, oak barrels, tropical flowers, splash of sea spray, vetiver, tonka)*: Dark, rich, creamy coconut. Very sweet, slightly floral. A touch of juicy pineapple. Somehow it isn't a typical sugary fruity summary smell. Something about it comes across a little earthy and spicy, moving into atmospheric territory. Tasty, sticky, sweet, summery, dark, rich, magical. I really struggle to find warm weather appropriate scents that I enjoy, but this incorporates the perfect amount of darkness for me. **9/10**
  
**Master Bedroom** *(Soft Skin Musk, Sandalwood EO, Amber, Clove EO, Somalian Myrrh EO, Vanilla, Aged Patchouli EO and Champaca Absolute)*: Warm, spicy, and musky but not overbearingly rich or resinous. Although I'm a fan of stinky ""head shop"" patchouli, there's no trace of that here. Surprisingly light, comes across very soft. A seductive scent that I can't stop sniffing. It's tickling my brain in all the right ways. Heated musk and spice rest on a sweet and mildly floral background. Ugh I adore this. **9/10** (This was my review prior to a long rest. Surprisingly I liked it less after a month? It seemed more dark and heavy. **8/10**)
  
**Outpost** *(Sugar Crystals, Spruce, Fir, Patchouli, Soft Woods, Bayberry,¬† Mistletoe, Oud, Amber)*: A cool blend of green and sugar resting on beautiful patchouli. Surprisingly light and airy. Definitely reads as cologney to me, which I don‚Äôt hate. Transforms after a while of wear and becomes softer, sweeter, spicier. It‚Äôs oddly fuzzy and warm after a few hours. An interesting ride, pretty from start to finish! Unfortunately there's a persistent Christmas candle vibe/association my brain can't shake. **7/10**
  
**Runestone** *(Natural Earthy Forest Blend With Aged Patchouli, Vetiver, Oakmoss, Cedar, Violet Leaf, Dirt, Leaves, Cypress, Spruce)*: Upon first sniff, it punches you in the face with medicinal herbiness. Pretty quickly it grows woody and mildly sweet. It feels Dark Green. Within fifteen minutes the herby smell almost entirely disappears and it becomes a very pleasant patchouli. It‚Äôs not what I was hoping for but it‚Äôs good! **7/10**
  
**Sawmill** *(Fresh Cut Wood, Wood Resin, Balsam, Cured Woods, Pine, Black Coffee, Motor Oil, Amber, Saw Dust)*: For the first few minutes this is a gust of crisp, coffee-scented air. As it dries it becomes very woody and vaguely floral? Maybe it's just the combination of increasing sweetness and woodsiness that's making my brain say it's floral. An oily quality becomes prominent. Interesting and unique blend that's dark, sweet woods and oil. You're a lumberjack drinking a latte. I'm obsessed. My boyfriend said it smells super diesely and sweet. **10/10**
  
**Upstairs Window** *(Glowing Amber, Dragon's Blood, Beeswax, Spices, Fog)*: Incensey dragon's blood, spice, and sugary sweetness. I was nervous this would be too candy-like at first but the sugar relaxes within a few minutes, mingling more politely with the resiny aspect. Feels slightly dusty to me? Genuinely headshoppy. **8/10**
      
      
EDIT: WAIT I JUST REALIZED I FORGOT ONE AND I'M LITERALLY WEARING IT RIGHT NOW. I blind bought a bottle of **Midnight Eye** *(Dark Coffee, Cigar Leaf, Cacao, Carob, Tonka, Labdanum, Aged Patchouli, Fossilized Amber, Cigar Ash, Oud)* and regret nothing. It's gorgeous! It's predominantly a perfect blend of coffee and cigars. Warm and dark with just the right amount of sweetness. I'm contemplating buying a full size EDP even thought that would be irresponsible. **10/10**",5,1735580773.0,Indiemakeupandmore,1,0.86,False
1hpssts,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1hpssts/brush_your_teeth/,Brush Your Teeth!,"TL;DR: Brushing my teeth has helped improve my acne.

Recently, I‚Äôve made a crazy discovery that I thought other ADHDers could benefit from. If you‚Äôre anything like me, you struggle with hygiene, especially brushing your teeth. As much as I know how important brushing my teeth is, I‚Äôve always struggled to make it happen. Whether it was the sensory component, task initiation, too boring, or I just didn‚Äôt want to, I always skipped it. I would brush my teeth before important events or during the weeks leading up to a dentist appointment, but otherwise, it NEVER happened. Even as an adult, I still couldn‚Äôt seem to suck it up and just brush my teeth despite knowing the damage I was doing to my teeth. I've been trying for the past year or so to work on my adulting skills. I decided to start with brushing my teeth because dental hygiene is so important and it only takes 5 minutes out of my whole day, but also because I knew it would help give me the confidence to smile, make new friends, try dating, and not have to hide it at work constantly.

I‚Äôve been making slow progress and love the feeling of checking it off in my habit tracking app. (I use Habit Tracker.) I‚Äôve been more confident, and it gives me a little boost in the morning to know that I already started off my day by checking something off my list. Recently, I found yet another reason to keep it up. My acne is practically gone! Full disclosure, I‚Äôm in my late 20s, so I don‚Äôt have the teen hormones anymore, so this may not work for everyone. I‚Äôm also not a medical professional; this is just my experience. The more consistent I am with my teeth brushing, the clearer my skin becomes. At first, I thought it was just a coincidence, but it continues to happen. When I stop brushing my teeth for a while, the acne comes back, but within a couple of days of brushing twice a day, my skin is back to clear. It‚Äôs been amazing and has once again boosted my confidence even more. I only wash my face once every other day in the shower, *if* that. Nothing fancy. Just a regular acne face wash and a light face lotion after. A quick Google search confirmed it‚Äôs not in my head; there‚Äôs not a ton of research backing it up, but there seems to be a strong correlation between dental hygiene and healthy skin, so why not try?!

If you‚Äôre wondering how I added tooth brushing into my life after over 20 years, here‚Äôs what worked for me.¬†

* Buy an electric toothbrush. Even if you‚Äôre broke like me, trust me that a one-time investment is waaay cheaper than dental work. Also, when I don‚Äôt feel like brushing, I know that a half-assed attempt with an electric toothbrush is still way better than what I‚Äôd do with a regular toothbrush.¬†
* Invest in a water pick, too, if you can! I find it faster and less annoying than floss. 
* Play around with different kinds of toothpaste. I started with kid‚Äôs toothpaste that had fun flavors, plus Disney characters! At one point, I bought multiple flavors so I could switch it up and make it more fun. My only requirement was that it had fluoride. Then, once it got a little easier to tolerate the sensory component, I decided to give whitening toothpaste a try to help with the coffee stains. I found that giving myself time to learn to brush my teeth with fun toothpaste first helped me get to where I wanted to eventually be.¬†If you don‚Äôt care about whitening, then maybe that‚Äôs not important for you to switch!¬†

* I don‚Äôt brush my tongue. I have a strong gag reflex, and I‚Äôll throw up, so I don‚Äôt even try. ",3,1735580731.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

1hpsqje,https://i.redd.it/67axzgb4w0ae1.png,On boundaries ,"Hey, hi, hello
So... I myself have had way too many personal bad roommates. Will share those for another time and will vent current situation cus I just woke up and dry heaved hard going into my boyfriend's bathroom. And i just woke up. 

My partner and I have been together for 2 years and are committed to our love, we will be living together when some temporary situations improve. It's been discussed in length how he is eager to move on up with living situations, and how stoked I am to not live with family as cushy as it is for me in some ways. 

He rents a room in a house, in a city with a really sad and stressful rental crisis. He has an unheard of deal for rent, and has three other roommates. Two per bathroom and one kitchen. One just moved in, and I was hired to clean for their arrival. I just wanna note for my own sanity, just because I have a professional cleaning background doesn't mean I pass any lifestyle judgements, and can handle a certain amount of chaos. That being said, the kitchen took me six full hours to clean, not including a mop which the household said they could handle ( lollllll. ), breaks not included. He shares a bathroom with one girl, lets call her F (because holy F I am SO fed up with this human's living standards). This bathroom took 5 and a half hours to clean, breaks not included. F happy cried and paid, all good stuff. Im happy to be comfy, and help where I can ‚òÜwithout being taken advantage of‚òÜ. I covered every inch of these two rooms and it was a tough clean in many ways.  

This is my bf's place so I really have no say in anything at all, I only encourage him to have boundaries and standards. We order in save for cereal, 100 percent of the time and use only his garbage, cus we both cannot handle the shared areas. We use only his bedroom and the bathroom in the house. 

F bleeds heavy monthly. They shove their soaked pads into the garbage and compact them every month I've known them out of two years. They will change it maybe every 3 months. I'm nose sensitive and this smells like low key or high key decaying matter constantly. They stained the toilet within days of me doing a deep clean, I pulled the bowl cleaner and brush into sight. A month or so later it finally got scrubbed. Used pads, hair balls and disgusting stuff is next to the stuffed waste bin even though it has a kitchen sized bag in it and could be changed literally with eyes closed. The bathroom has a thin wall separating my boyfriend's room. I have never heard F wash their hands but have heard many messy sounding bathroom trips. Then they smoke, and or roll green, and or make food and have seen them lick fingers when done. JFC. 

So, here i am scrolling BadRoommates thinking how many cringe posts I could make of my own and of my boyfriend's living shituation. I think, I want to protect F's dignity, because I do like them as a person in many ways. I make a coffee, put it on bedside table, and go to bathroom. I go to sit down and there is a blood clot on the toilet seat and pee on floor. Their toothbrush is angled how i placed it when I cleaned two months ago, and dry as that day too. I gagged and almost lost last night's dinner. I grabbed gloves, cleaner, rags and made it usable. I left supplies out in plain sight. I want to attach the pics but I'm so appalled and can't sink to that level and compound feeling this disgusted by filthy human beings. 

Long of the short...... I would absolutely not tolerate this (very short list of many many reasons) from someone I share a HOME with. I am an empathetic and loving human with absolute understanding for mental health struggles.  This lifestyle is NOT one I appreciate, as it is very very inconsiderate, unsanitary, unsightly, selfish, immature and fully disgusting. If it was my situation, the roommate wouldn't walk past me in the hallway without it being calmly and directly confronted, and immediately fixed. By confronted, I mean civilized conversation. If roommate felt it something they could not manage, hired services would be discussed. If it was ongoing disrespect, I would move after 3 strikes. 

It is up to you to determine your boundaries and no one else's. It is up to you to communicate and learn your needs and standards, and hold people accountable, or establish space to keep yourself safe and sane. I know how brutal tough it is out there with housing, and I send out a lot of love.

1hpspzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hpspzs/re_adrift/,Re: Adrift ,"The hiss of pressure being released filled the darkened steel room, metal grating against metal as a glass tube was slowly pushed from besides the hundreds of others just like it. Inside, a dark shadow floating in a thick viscous blue liquid hardly moved as the metal arms carrying the tube slowly slotted the large glass construct into one of the slots on the floor- dozens going from wall to wall.¬† A solid *thunk* reverberating through the walls as the tube settled in place.

**‚Äú231,047,344,927 seconds since mission start. 44,928 seconds since diagnosis. Waking Occupant 27, Jacob Bridgestock. Initiating cryostasis end protocols‚Äù** 

The slightly rusty, well worn arms slowly pulled away from the glass tube. With a spark of electricity, and a puff of black smoke, one of the arms nearly fell apart as they slipped away into the allocated hole from whence they had emerged. However, nothing seemed hindered, as more machines slowly lowered themselves from the ceiling. Needles, tubes, and smaller mechanical hands reaching the smooth glass of the cryochamber. The top sliding to the side, allowing these machines access inside. Their glistening steel slowly pushing the viscous liquid aside, some spilling from the top of the tube as they reached the shadow within. 

**‚ÄúRestarting cardiovascular activity. Flushing preservation substance. Restarting digestive tract. Initiating red cell production‚Ä¶ Initiating white cell production‚Ä¶ Restarting cell division.¬† Brain tissue preserved- restarting neurological activity‚Ä¶‚Äù**

As the synthesized voice floated through the air, announcing the biological systems being kickstarted back to life, the dark shadow within began to twitch. At first, only detectable if you had a keen eye, soon they were almost convulsive. The machines quickly rose back out of the liquid and into the ceiling as the glass tube slid downward at an alarming rate, the blue liquid oozing outward like spilled honey. The shadow- now clearly a man- burst forward, their toned muscles flexing as they ripped themselves away from where they had been floating. Their brown hair still coated in the blue ooze as they promptly vomited onto the floor- the liquid disappearing quickly as the slots took even the cryo liquid deep into the ship. To be cleaned, and if possible, reused. 

‚ÄúF-Fuck.‚Äù

Jacob gasped, taking his first real breath in who knew how long. Cryo was a lot rougher than he had been assured.¬† The last time he had puked was when he was twelve, and he ate too much cake at his own birthday party. He watched as more cryo liquid dripped off his naked body and onto the floor, shivering as he slowly stood. Taking another deep breath, he slowly took in his surroundings. When he had been put into cryostasis, he had been on earth. He remembered it well, the stark white and blue of a hospital still fresh in his memory. The doctors had said something about it being easier to store people in tubes than trying to coordinate everyone onto the ship- and that they didn‚Äôt have to worry about keeping everyone alive to get onto the ship since they were already dead, technically. He hadn‚Äôt really been paying attention to that part. He wanted to know how the *mechanics* of the machines had worked, but hadn‚Äôt gotten a chance to ask. Now‚Ä¶ Now he was being met with a sleek, gray metal room with slotted floors, glowing blue tubes he assumed were other colonists all over the walls. Neatly arranged like tools on a tool rack. And a single pathway leading away and into the halls of the ship. The Ulixes. 

**‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre finally awake?‚Äù**

The synthesized voice blared out from the speakers, almost teasing. Making Jacob jump nearly a mile high. That had to be Evelyn, the onboard AI. Her, he knew. All too well. 

‚ÄúYes, I am, and if you would be oh so *kind* as to lead me to the showers so i can wash this gunk off me, that would be great.‚Äù   
  
A basketball sized drone slowly floated from ahead, emerging from the darkness. It was one of the many drones Evelyn had access to, this one was clearly one of the medical variety. Its bubble-like white shell only marked with a bright glowing red cross, and its two mechanical arms hanging from each side. Those arms looked as if they could split into dozens of different medical tools- it was quite handy, and it looked like it was one of the brand new top-of-the-line ones. 

**‚ÄúOf course Jacob! Follow me. Well, the drone.‚Äù** 

The drone beeped before slowly turning- its hovering frame glimmering with blue as it caught the light of the cryotubes, the red cross lighting the way. Jacob sighed, and tried to cover his manhood as he followed the drone- hoping that he was the first one to wake up, so there were no awkward bump ins with his crewmates. His feet made wet slaps as he left a trail of cryo fluid behind him. Jacob sighed in relief as the hot water rolled over his back- the blue liquid slowly swirling into the drain as he closed his eyes. He hadn‚Äôt met anyone else on the way to the showers, so he had to be the first of the crew that Evelyn had decided to wake up. Made sense, wake the engineer, let him check out the engine, the rest of the ship, and if anything needs repairing they can already be on it as the rest of them joined him in the land of the living. He snorted a bit at the literalism of the phrase, running his fingers through his hair to make sure the rest of the cryo liquid was removed. Honestly, he was currently just happy to see they had hot water. Means he wouldn‚Äôt have to mess with any pipes.   
  
Finishing up, he found a fluffy white towel waiting for him as he stepped out of the shower (which thankfully, had walls. So no communal showers. Probably suggested by the shrinks). Quickly wrapping the only piece of cloth he currently had around his waist, the edges of the towel rested against his knees as he looked for the medical drone. It was patiently waiting for him just outside the room, facing away from the door. 

‚ÄúWhat, embarrassed?‚Äù 

Jacob teased, lightly slapping the top of the drone's body. It beeped before Evelyn's voice emerged from the built-in speaker in the unit. 

**‚ÄúHa ha, i may be an artificial being but i‚Äôm still a** ***lady*** **Jacob.‚Äù** 

Jacob rolled his eyes as he made sure the towel was firmly wrapped around his waist. Thankfully the soft yellowed light of the hallway was easy to see in, so he had no trouble. ‚ÄúAnd where was that embarrassment when I was buck naked and covered in cryo fluid, hm?‚Äù Evelyn didn‚Äôt seem to answer, the drone only floating forward. Jacob followed, a slight grin plastered on his face. One of the arms of the drone seemed to dislocate and land on the ground with a loud crash, nearly tripping him. 

**‚ÄúOops.‚Äù** 

Evelyn said casually, Jacob frowning at the drone in obvious fiend indignity. However, he didn‚Äôt say anything else, simply following the drone. The arm it had so easily dislocated, clicking back into place as it floated forward. Quite quickly, they found themselves in the living section of the ship. It wasn‚Äôt far from the showers, so it made sense. He had suggested that himself- nobody wanted to be walking very long after a very hard day at work just to get clean. 

**‚ÄúRoom 07. All the items you bought with you should be waiting inside. Including some proper clothes.‚Äù** 

Jacob nodded, looking at the airlock before him. He had helped design the dorms with the rest of the crew. An airlock in case the hull had a breach while most of them were sleeping, a hand scanner as well as a physical override to the right- and a large window in the center, which you could change the opacity of. He was quite proud of it, actually.   
  
‚ÄúThanks Evelyn. I‚Äôll get dressed, just send me the diagnostics list and I'll get started on something.‚Äù 

The drone beeped, before turning and floating back the way they had come- vanishing around the corner. He took a deep breath and placed the palm of his hand against the scanner. For a moment, he thought it was broken, as it made a horrible buzzing sound- and then the door slid smoothly to the left. Relieved, he walked confidently inside and opened up the locker against the wall to his left as the door slid back into place and sealed with a *thunk*. His tool belt, worn and well loved, hung on its hook like an obedient pet. His adaptive environmental suit hung beside it, looking like a deflated white balloon. He knew the look was deceiving, but it was hard not to imagine it just flopping around as he walked. In reality it was ungodly well fitting, and would cinch to his body perfectly. On the floor of the locker, his helmet. The sticker of earth he had slapped onto the bottom jaw still looked as snazzy as he remembered. It was a small touch of home, but it brought him more comfort than he was willing to admit. Just besides the helmet, his datapad. It‚Äôs almost invisible glass body only broken by the two gray control pads on each side. A small red light blinking on its surface, calling his attention. 

‚ÄúSorry, you‚Äôre gonna have to wait just a moment.‚Äù 

Jacob murmured, grabbing his suit and slipping into the open cavity in the back. Placing his hands firmly into place, he squeezed his hands into fists three times in quick succession. The suit reacted almost instantly, tightening around his body- the white hexagons turning blue, just as he had programmed it. When it finished, it felt like a second skin. Though to everyone else it looked like a proper space suit, bulky in the right places and thin where it should be. He scooped his tool belt off its hook and slipped it around his waist, letting its familiar weight settle on his hips. He picked up the helmet, looking into the opaque visor and checking for cracks- when he found none, he set the helmet where a hood would have been, the light carbon alloy letting it hang there just as easily. 

‚ÄúAnd now for you.‚Äù

He grabbed the edge of the datapad and flicked his wrist, the pad flipping into the air only for him to catch it again with ease. Tapping the screen, he was greeted with a rather short list of repair jobs. Almost chewing the words, he began to walk out of his room as he ran through the list, the door sliding smoothly away as he approached. 

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see‚Ä¶ food printer twelve in the mess hall is not operating correctly‚Ä¶ drone two-thirty is heavily damaged. Engine room has something loose, and the bridge port shielding is operating slightly below predicted. Well. I know where I'm gonna start.‚Äù

Jacob looked at the wall, eyes trailing down the rainbow of colored lines that would lead you where one to where they needed to go on the ship. Found the magenta line, and began to follow it. ‚ÄúFood printer twelve, here I come.‚Äù 

Arriving at the mess hall, Jacob hummed as he clicked the datapad to his belt, and deftly drew one of his diagnostic tools as he searched for the misbehaving machinery. The screen flickering to life as he counted out the printers along the walls, their girth making them oh-so-easy to find. 

**‚ÄúOf all the tasks, you start here?‚Äù** 

Jacob jumped as Evelyn‚Äôs voice emerged from the speakers, nearly dropping his diagnostic tool. Giving one of the cameras watching him from the corners of the room, he was very glad he had vetoed the suggestion to put speakers into the dorms. 

‚ÄúYes, everything else can be worked on afterwards. I‚Äôm sure everyone will appreciate not being sprayed with a mystery fluid when they decide to eat for the first time in decades, and a hot meal is important.‚Äù 

He tapped the diagnostic tool against his head as he spoke, before walking over to one of the printers and checking the number engraved onto its side. It read twelve, and he did a little fist pump as he hooked up the two small plugs to the machine. 

**‚ÄúThen why didn‚Äôt you get yourself a hot meal? I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd have appreciated one, as you said.‚Äù** 

Jacob, focused on his diagnostic tool, waved dismissively as he began reading the data flowing before his eyes. 

‚ÄúYeah but I basically run off energy drinks. I‚Äôm no stranger to skipping breakfast, as long as I can get my hands on one.‚Äù 

There was a very audible sigh as he unplugged the tool from the printer, and slotted it back where it belonged on his belt. Grabbing the wrench beside it, he reached under the beast and popped open the access port. Nearly climbing into the thing, he began searching for the extruder, two small lights popping on by his shoulders. 

**‚ÄúThat‚Äôs quite unhealthy Jacob‚Äù** 

Evelyn commented disapprovingly, as Jacob moved aside some wiring and tubes with his wrench. His lights shine on one of the few metal things in this machine- the extruder. 

‚ÄúMaybe, but it‚Äôs a time honored tradition of any engineer. Don‚Äôt mess with something that ain't broke Evelyn. Some think if an engineer isn‚Äôt caffeinated, nothing gets fixed properly.‚Äù 

He grunted as he placed the wrench around the bolt holding the extruder to the nutrient pipe, slowly turning it. His muscles strained as he fought against a factory tightened bolt.**‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a myth.‚Äù** Suddenly, he felt no resistance at all, and the bolt came free. And smashed his hand into the wall of the printer, hissing in pain as he shook his hand. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd think but every engineer I've ever met agrees, so your opinion is null and void.‚Äù 

After making sure he hadn‚Äôt hurt his hand and giving the machine gods their blood offering (he hadn‚Äôt even broken the suit‚Äôs surface) he reached into the nearly fist-sized pipe. Feeling around for what he was sure, no, knew was the problem. With a pop, he pulled out a solid pink mass of- something. Some clear liquid following from behind and splattering onto the bottom of the machine.¬†

‚ÄúAHA! Got you, you little fuck.‚Äù

Tossing the pink ball of.. Probably what was supposed to be ham, he placed the extruder back into place and began tightening it back up, 

**‚ÄúI disagree.‚Äù** 

Jacob rolled his eyes as he finished tightening the bolt, giving it a good firm tug to make sure it didn‚Äôt come loose. When it indeed didn‚Äôt, he swung himself out of the printer and slapped the access port back into place. 

‚ÄúWell, disagree all you like. I know the truth.‚Äù 

Triumphantly, he typed in an order to the printer for a cup of pudding. It began to spur to life, lights turning on as his shoulder lights turned off. The nozzle slowly moved forward, into position over the build plate. A cup popped up from below as the tube began to shake. Before he could react or turn it off, pudding sprayed out from just above the bolt in all directions, coating everything in a brown sludge. For a second, Jacob just stood there, before he slowly wiped the pudding from his eyes and turned to one of the cameras. 

‚ÄúI should have had coffee first.‚Äù 

He grumbled, Evelyn‚Äôs soft laugh bubbling out of every speaker around him as he headed back to the showers. 

After his second shower of the day, he washed his environmental suit in one of the showers. While they were pretty amazing, they didn‚Äôt self wash yet. But it was odd, he still hadn‚Äôt met anyone. ‚ÄúHey, Evelyn?¬† Shouldn‚Äôt there be other people awake by now?‚Äù He looked down at his freshly cleaned datapad- he had spent at least an hour washing off his things, and however long he had taken to get his things and (try) to fix the food printer. 

**‚ÄúYou are- correct. Strangely, I don't detect any other life signs on the ship. Not that that means much, since they‚Äôre all basically bodies-‚Äù** 

Slipping his helmet back into its place, he began to speed-walk his way back into the cryo chamber. Stopping at the doorway, watching as the arms- arm, one of them was shot, wires hanging from its joint- why hadn‚Äôt that been on his to do list?- as the other working hand picked up another cryopod and placed it into a slot. The entire dance started again, the arms lowering down into the tube and trying to inject and flush- but there was nobody inside. Which should have been impossible, every single cryopod should have someone. Looking around, he saw that dozens of slots had the telltale glass ring showing they had been drained‚Ä¶ but not a soul. Running now, Jacob began to look at each pod. No shadow, no arm, not even a face pressed against the glass. Not one other pod had a body in it. 

‚ÄúEvelyn! Where ***is*** everyone?‚Äù 

He yelled, sprinting now as he checked dozens more. He ran through the halls, through various rooms. Planning, navigation, even hydroponics and the engine room. 

**‚ÄúI- don‚Äôt know. Internal diagnostics show that everyone is accounted for‚Ä¶ Wait. an unknown time ago, the Ulixes was struck by a stray asteroid and all systems went offline for 400,000,00 seconds. Data was lost. Location- Unknown. Crew- Unaccounted for-‚Äù** 

She began to list off everything that she found, and Jacob felt overwhelmed. Not only was the crew he had trained, lived with, and prepared to share a new home with missing‚Ä¶ but they didn‚Äôt even know where they were. They had missed Kepler-20f, by a long shot. He was alone, with an AI, in space, without knowledge of anywhere he could go. He sat down, resting his chin on his fist as he thought. He didn‚Äôt know if he could go back into Cryo, and even if he could, should he? He didn‚Äôt know what happened to the crew, and for all he knew, they had dissolved into the cryo liquid after being in it for‚Ä¶¬†

‚ÄúEvelyn, how long were we- was I asleep?‚Äù 

He asked quietly. Evelyn stopped listing off things and paused, calculating the time, converting into minutes, hours, years- the tension could have been cut with a knife. 

**‚Äú7,321 years.‚Äù** 

He looked at the ceiling and let out a long breath, holding his knees as he thought it over. Seven thousand years. An absurd amount of time, so much time lost to the sleep of cryo stasis. So many opportunities to have stopped their course, check to make sure it was plotted correctly. It was the one system Evelyn hadn‚Äôt been hooked up to, running autonomously all on its own. With four backup servers to make sure it didn‚Äôt even come close to having a lapse in function. 

‚ÄúOkay. Okay. So, what we know. We‚Äôre lost. The crew has either turned to mush in the pods or were kidnapped or- something. Really hoping it‚Äôs not aliens. Or xenomorphs. Oh please don‚Äôt be xenomorphs-‚Äù 

He laughed nervously, running his fingers through his hair as he continued to look up at the ceiling. 

**‚ÄúWell there‚Äôs no movement on the ship besides my drones‚Ä¶ so I don't think that would be it.‚Äù** 

Evelyn said helpfully, Jacob taking several deep breaths to calm himself. She was right. That was a movie monster. It wasn‚Äôt real, and it never would be. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. You‚Äôre right, I'm being stupid. First thing we learned was to remain calm. Okay. Evelyn, I'll figure out what happened to the crew. While I'm doing that, can you scan the surrounding stars around us and try and get where we are in the milky way? We didn‚Äôt leave it, that would have taken millions of years.‚Äù 

With a pop, Evelyn went silent. Taking a moment, he listened to the almost imperceptible hum of the engine, taking comfort in its regularity. 

""Okay, if anything is gonna have information on what happened to- everyone, I need to get to the server banks. Those should be‚Ä¶‚Äù 

He pulled out his datapad, hands shaking slightly as he tapped the screen and began looking at the layout of the almost spear shaped ship.‚Äú...one room below the bridge. Directly below it. Makes sense, that‚Äôs where the most data is gonna be so might as well put it close.‚Äù Getting back onto his feet, he closed his eyes for a moment before heading into the hallway and looking at the wall- slowly panning over the different colored bands before stopping on the black line, and following it. Behind him, a security drone detached from the wall and began to follow behind him, silently. Finding the door easily, he placed his palm on the scanner- and was denied access. 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

He tried again, and again was denied access. Cursing quietly, he pulled out his diagnostic tool and hooked it up to the scanner. ‚ÄúNo clearance? I should have clearance to the entire ship, this doesn‚Äôt make sense.‚Äù He clicked his diagnostic tool off again and slotted it back in its place at his hip, grabbing his multitool. Its sleek design helped make the various tools look less garish. Pulling out a single wire, he clicked the pin into place, and began trying to override the system. He cursed again when his wire fried, smoking slightly as he pulled the pin out and frowned.   
  


‚ÄúEv-‚Äù

Evelyn‚Äôs voice popped up from his datapad, nearly scaring him half to death- again. 

**‚ÄúYes Jacob? What‚Äôs the Matter?‚Äù** 

He put a hand on his chest and let out a long breath before answering. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have access to the server room.

‚ÄùThere was a pause before she spoke again. 

**‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs not possible, you have the highest clearance right behind the captain-‚Äù** 

Jacob held up his hand, her voice slowly fading.

‚ÄúI know. Which is why it‚Äôs weird. Can you get it open for me?‚Äù 

There was another pause, before with a clunk and a hiss, the airlock slid away to reveal the server room. With a smile, he looked up to the camera and gave it a wink, trodding into the room- the security drone following close behind as the door sealed closed behind him. Walking between the towers that reached all the way to the ceiling, Jacob looked down at his datapad and began searching for a port he could slot his pad into. Quickly finding one, he pressed his pad into the coin-like slot and waited as the little green light blinked on and off. It seemed to take an eternity, but eventually the light turned from green to blue, signaling he had access to the servers. 

‚ÄúAnd here we go, let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs in store for me.‚Äù 

Pulling his datapad from the slot, he flipped it in his hands- almost apprehensive, before he began opening files. There wasn‚Äôt a lot interesting, thousands of diagnostic reports, reports from the navigation system saying everything was working properly- though he paused at a file that seemed to be buried beneath a bunch of these reports. 

‚ÄúAvalon?‚Äù

He asked curiously, pressing on the file- immediately, his pad began to glitch and fritz out, smoke beginning to billow out of the sleek frame. Dropping the quickly heating technology, he backed away- the pad completely frying in a matter of seconds. 

‚ÄúWhat the actual hell is going on?‚Äù

1hpsodu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1hpsodu/first_post/,First post‚Ä¶,"I (21m) have been trying to write something down about how I‚Äôve been feeling for a long time and my wife (22f) found this sub and recommended I try to say it all here. So here it goes-

My mom (45) has been drinking nearly every day since she stopped breastfeeding me basically. Growing up there were never huge issues that were related to her drinking but small things like she drank too much so she stopped driving because she didn‚Äôt want to get into accidents but that meant she missed a lot of my events and if I was late for the bus or anything similar it was up to me to work out. Anyway, my dad and her divorced when I was a baby but remained close friends. He died when I was 11 and her drinking got substantially worse. I didn‚Äôt really see her for about 5 years after that because she was in her room in the dark asleep and I used to be so embarrassed to have anyone over and would often lie that we were home alone.

I have had a step dad since I was 8 and I love him but he worked so much i was mostly alone. My older brother was too angsty to speak to me. 

The real problem begins about 1 1/2 ago. My mom breaks down and admits she has been cheating on my step dad with random people for 12 years. She blamed it on the drinking. Instead of using that as an opportunity to stop drinking she got substantially worse, then my stepdad followed suit.. 

I haven‚Äôt been able to spend more than 20 minutes with my mom at a time because she is always so drunk and she lies about everything. She try‚Äôs to make me insecure and she sobs and sobs when I try to set boundaries saying stuff like I just don‚Äôt love her and ‚Äú people are fucked  up and marriage is fucked up but we are family‚Äù also often saying I‚Äôll understand how difficult marriage is eventually (she loves my wife no worries there)

Last thanksgiving we went to my stepdads family‚Äôs house. They are LDS Mormons. We have always been the outcasts but they are our family. She showed up drunk and kept trying to embarrass my wife and I. Luckily my family loves me very much and didn‚Äôt fall for any of it but I can‚Äôt stand the looks she gets and the whispers. In July after that thanksgiving my grandma on my step dad‚Äôs side passed and we went up for the funeral. My mom drank a lot before the LDS funeral and made it all about her and not my grandmas 6 kids. It was embarrassing. We were all staying at my aunts house and my mom and I got in a fight because I asked her to stop following my wife and I around. I got so many messages and calls from family to ask what‚Äôs wrong with her and why she‚Äôs insane.

Fast forward to Christmas. My wife, my brother (23 m) drive a couple hours to go to family Christmas. We are the first to show up and my parents are second. The first thing I noticed when my mom sat next to me was that she was sober. I haven‚Äôt seen her sober in a long long time. I enjoyed her company, she wasn‚Äôt invasive, she wasn‚Äôt speaking over everybody and she wasn‚Äôt demanding the attention of the room. This was all perfect until around 9:30 when she snapped at me and told my wife to take her back to my aunts house. I told her no because we weren‚Äôt ready to leave. She said some rude things snapped at my step dad and went into a dark room alone. My brother and I went to check on her eventually and found her shaking and sweating. I immediately recognized it as withdrawal. No one would take her home so she stayed like that. She was mean and loud but we let her alone.

After we got to my aunts house that night my mom was mostly fine once she had a few beers. On the drive back with just my wife and brother I asked my brother if he thought it‚Äôs time to do something for mom and he said he had never really thought about it and he also thought the night was weird but he wasn‚Äôt sure. I asked him to just pay attention and let me know.

The next morning I woke up at 9 to find my mom already intensely drunk. My brother said she had had atleast 3 beers since he woke up. As everyone else woke up she started intentionally harassing me so I asked for 15 minutes to let me finish my breakfast and coffee and then I would give her my attention. She followed me around in-front of everyone saying things about me that she knows I don‚Äôt like, calling me mean and pretending to poke me. Finally my wife snapped and  told her to back off which helped. She then went to the couch started whining and fell asleep for a minute. (My step dad is here the whole time zoned out as always. He is an extreme enabler and also a heavy drinker) 
My family starts asking my wife how she deals with it all and my wife responds with a chuckle and just says my family is wild too. My wife is the best.

We are all getting ready to drive the five hours home around 12 and my parents beg us to please grab lunch with them before we go and I agreed because I worry too much about making them sad. We go to a resteraunt down the road and on the drive there my brother says he thinks my mom needs some serious help and that he always thought at family events everyone was looking at our family weird because of him (idk why he would think this but he‚Äôs always thought everyone is out to get him or hates him) I told him it was really nice to not feel like I‚Äôm just the AH who‚Äôs constantly criticizing my mom. 

At the restaurant a child at another table starts climbing table and screaming and my mom yells at it to stop. Then the waitress comes by and my mom tells her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to strangle that kid‚Äù the waitress didn‚Äôt know what to say and akward laughed and took our order. When she walked away my brother snapped at my mom and told her to behave and my step dad tried to explain she can‚Äôt say that stuff. Then she started throwing her arms around and fake sobbing saying everyone is so mean to her. She starts targeting me and saying I hate her and my brother is her favorite and he‚Äôs nice to her. Then my brother interrupted and told her to just leave it all alone. We tried to have normal conversations but everytime anyone but her was speaking she interrupted so eventually everything was quiet except the sound of her voice. My wife and I left, my brother drove home with them. 

Finally, my grandma ( her mom) calls and although she wasn‚Äôt with us for Christmas says that she‚Äôs been talking to my mom all day and she‚Äôs getting very concerned about how much she drinks. We have never really talked about this together because I didn‚Äôt want to worry anyone but I told her everything from pretty much my whole life. My grandma told my aunt my wife told her parents and everyone wants to do an intervention but my mom lies so much I don‚Äôt even know if it will work. All she does is lie all day long.  Every word out of her mouth is a falsehood.

She used to have a million friends in our small town, used to light up a room. She‚Äôs incredibly intelligent and well educated. Now no one can stand her and the only proof she even had friends is that they message me a lot to ask how she is and ask if I need anything. 

Obviously there‚Äôs so much more to all of this but I‚Äôm at a breaking point. And thinking about her consumes me. My wife and I are starting to plan having kids and unless my mom is sober I never want her to meet them. She used to be my best friend.

There‚Äôs also the fear that I will end up just like her. I enjoy drinking. I never want to be anything like her and everytime I lift up a can I think I look like her. ",2,1735580419.0,AlAnon,1,1.0,False

I bribed my daughter with coffee this morning so I could just spend time with her‚Ä¶ she scrolled her phone, answered me with one work answers‚Ä¶ really feels like she‚Äôs just generally disinterested in me and when I brought up I‚Äôm feeling left out (we were talking about financing college) she just said she‚Äôs independent and she‚Äôs trying to figure this out on her own.

I told her I‚Äôm glad she wants to do that but also I have some advice I could give you. And she just said she‚Äôll ask me if she needs help‚Ä¶ then awkward silence. So we ended our coffee date early.

I knew transitioning to empty nester was going to be hard but damn‚Ä¶ I feel like I just exist to her and like see ya wouldn‚Äôt want to be ya.

1hpsf9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1hpsf9a/unfiltered_pt_2/,Unfiltered pt. 2,"It's late. The lab is almost empty, only the sound of the keyboard and the distant hum of the coffee machine break the silence. The clock on the wall reads 9:15 PM. At this hour, I'm usually in my office, surrounded by books and papers, immersed in preparing the lecture I must give on free will. But today, I can't focus. My mind is caught in a whirlwind of thoughts that don't seem to fit together.

I'm reviewing studies on the human brain, recent research on decision-making, and the surprising conclusions from neuroscientists. Something is nagging at me, but I don't know how to process it. I open another article. It's a study discussing how the human brain makes decisions even before we, as individuals, are aware of them‚Äîexactly 550 milliseconds before we become conscious.¬†*It's as if we're puppets of our brain,*¬†I think, skimming through the words.

I recall when I first read about Benjamin Libet's experiments. In those studies, participants thought they were making decisions in real time, but in reality, their brains had already activated the necessary areas seconds before they became aware of it. In other words, our brain seems to take control before we can even say, ""I decided."" Does that mean we are completely subject to a destiny we cannot control?

My mind drifts to another, more unsettling thought. If our brain makes decisions without our consent, could that explain criminal behavior? Could a lack of control be a justification for heinous acts? Perhaps criminals, murderers, aren't entirely responsible for what they do if the brain makes decisions for them. But I can't help but question: is it really that simple?

I can't stop reading‚Äîanother page and another. The information on the brain areas involved in criminal behavior draws me in, another piece fitting into the puzzle in my mind. The amygdala, that small almond-shaped structure, governs emotion, fear, anger, and even reward processing. The prefrontal cortex, located at the front of the brain, is associated with rational decision-making, impulse control, and morality. It's as if the battle between emotion and reason happens within our brain.

But something stops me. Something doesn't fit. Something beyond the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex: the thalamus. This ""gatekeeper"" that connects sensory information to the brain, integrating what we perceive from the external world. It's the processing center of our reality. What if dysregulation in the thalamus has something to do with criminal behavior? The thought appears in my mind suddenly, like a flash of light in the dark. If the thalamus isn't properly managing sensory information, if it's transmitting erroneous signals to the brain, could that influence how we perceive the world? Could it make someone see reality in a distorted way, leading to violence, impulsivity, and a lack of empathy?

My heart races, as if a click has just sounded in my head. I stare at the computer screen for a moment, motionless. The hypothesis slowly takes shape‚Äîa sketch of a theory that could change everything.¬†*This needs to be explored,*¬†I think. But I don't have time to dwell on it; my lecture on free will begins in a few hours. I quickly review my class notes. But now, the words feel empty, as if they no longer matter. I can't stop thinking about this hypothesis. I need to research more, and I need to share it with someone‚Äîsomeone who can help me understand if this hypothesis holds any weight.

I open my office door and head down the hallway to the lab where Sofia usually is. I find her reviewing some graphs on bee behavior.

\- ""Sofia,"" I call out urgently, my voice vibrating with excitement. ""I have a new hypothesis about criminal behavior... I think there's something more. Something in the brain, something we haven't considered.""

Sofia turns to me, surprised by my tone.

\- ""What's going on, Martina? Did you figure something out? Wait‚Äîour project is about bees. Why are you coming up with hypotheses about humans and... murderers?""

\- ""It's the thalamus. I've been reading about free will and criminal behavior, and I think the thalamus could be involved. If it doesn't regulate sensory information correctly, we might be seeing a distortion of reality‚Äîone that could justify certain impulsive behaviors, even criminal ones.""

Sofia looks at me in silence for a moment. Her expression becomes thoughtful, almost as if she's evaluating what I just said.

\- ""That sounds... interesting, but it's also a pretty bold hypothesis, isn't it?"" she responds, rubbing her chin as she thinks. ""Are you sure there's something about the thalamus that could influence that kind of behavior?""

\- ""I'm not sure, but it's something I want to explore. And I don't think it's a coincidence that criminal behavior is often linked to alterations in brain areas like the amygdala or prefrontal cortex. If everything is connected, maybe the thalamus is the missing link.""

Sofia nods slowly, as if considering the possibility.

\- ""Okay, Martina. But we should discuss this with the team. This could change the direction of our research. If we're willing to go down this path, we need stronger evidence.""

Anxiety consumes me. I know I've made a decision, but I also feel the weight of what it implies. Could this be what finally leads us to discover something big?

.

.

The tension in the air is palpable as I stand in front of the mirror in the conference room, adjusting my hair and mentally going over the notes of what I'm about to say. Sofia stands beside me, equally nervous, though outwardly calmer. She doesn't know how the research group will react to my hypothesis, and neither do I.

\- ""Are you sure this is what you want to do?"" Sofia asks, lowering her voice so no one else can hear.

\- ""I don't have another choice. If I don't do it now, I'll never do it. But... I need your help to make my hypothesis make sense,"" I reply, feeling my words catch in my throat. ""I promise everything will fall into place. After the meeting, we'll find the answers we need.""

Sofia gives me a slight nod, though her expression is filled with uncertainty. I, on the other hand, am determined, but I also feel a knot in my stomach. What if they don't believe me? What if all of this is just an illusion I've created in my head? The door opens, and Avery, the group leader, enters. His presence, always imposing, fills the room. He's a tall man with short hair and thick-framed glasses. He has a way of looking at people that makes you feel like he's constantly analyzing you.

\- ""Martina,"" he says with a slight smile, observing my nervousness. ""You're ready for the meeting. Remember, we're going to talk about the results of the project, I want to know what factor explains the erratic behavior of the bees.""

\- ""Yes, Avery,"" I respond, trying to make my voice sound firm. ""But before we dive into the details of the bee behavior, I want to talk about something else. Something that's been on my mind.""

He raises an eyebrow, intrigued, but nods.

\- ""Make it quick, Martina. We don't have much time. If you have something to say, better say it now.""

Sofia looks at me as if urging me to get to the point, and I take a deep breath, looking at the research group already gathered around the table. There's a murmur of conversations and some nervous laughter, but the atmosphere quickly calms when they all notice I've stood up. With one hand gripping my notes, I begin to speak.

\- ""I've been thinking about something that could change the course of our research. For weeks, we've focused on the behavior of the bees and how their action patterns have started to deviate from what we expected. But what's been on my mind isn't just the bees... what I want to investigate now is human behavior. And specifically, criminal behavior.""

Upon hearing these words, the room falls silent. The faces of my colleagues light up with expressions of confusion, curiosity, and in some cases, skepticism. Avery, in the back, adjusts his glasses and watches me closely.

\- ""What are you talking about, Martina?"" Avery asks, not hiding the surprise in his voice. ""Are you suggesting that criminal behavior has something to do with what we're investigating about the bees?""

\- ""No, it's not exactly that,"" I reply, my voice shaking slightly. ""What I'm suggesting is that human behavior, and particularly criminal behavior, could be influenced by dysfunction in the brain areas that control our perception of the world. I'm talking specifically about the thalamus.""

I see some of the team members look at each other, their eyes full of doubt. Others begin to take notes. I feel a little more at ease seeing that at least they're paying attention.

\- ""Martina,"" interjects Javier, one of the researchers, a tall man with curly hair and glasses. ""Are you saying that the behavior of killers can be explained by failures in the thalamus? That people who commit crimes have no control over what they do?""

\- ""Not exactly,"" I respond quickly, searching for the right words. ""I'm saying that if the thalamus, which regulates the integration of sensory information, isn't working properly, we might be seeing a distortion of reality. This could explain impulsivity, lack of empathy, and in extreme cases, criminal behavior. This is something I want to investigate thoroughly. The bees might be a clue, but this is much bigger.""

Avery leans back in his chair, thoughtful. His gaze shifts from me to the rest of the group.

\- ""So, you're asking me to change the focus of the project for something we haven't tested yet? A hypothesis that could be completely wrong?""

My heart pounds, but I take a deep breath before responding.

\- ""Yes, Avery. But I also think it's a unique opportunity. If we manage to prove that this kind of dysfunction in the brain could be behind criminal behavior, we might have a new way of understanding psychopathy, criminality, and justice.""

The silence lingers in the room as my words hang in the air. Finally, Avery leans forward, his eyes locked on mine. Everyone waits for his response.

\- ""Alright,"" he says after a moment of reflection. ""I'll allow you to continue with this line of research. But I want you to have a clear plan. If we're going to make this change, we need an experimental design, and we need results soon. We can't afford to waste time.""

I feel a wave of relief, though I'm still nervous. Avery hasn't fully said ""yes,"" but he's agreed to investigate the possibility. It's all I needed.

\- ""Thank you, Avery. You won't regret it,"" I say, feeling the adrenaline coursing through my veins.

Days later, Sofia and I are in the lab, looking at the whiteboard covered with diagrams and data about the mice we're going to use in the experiment. The lab animals are perfect for this: small, easy to handle, and with a nervous system similar enough to humans that we can extrapolate the results. My hypothesis is beginning to take shape.

\- ""Are you sure we want to do this, Martina?"" Sofia asks as she jots down some notes. ""What if something goes wrong?""

\- ""We have no other choice; this is our chance to test something revolutionary,"" I reply, looking at the experiment outline I've designed. ""We're going to test how thalamic dysfunction affects the behavior of the mice. And if we succeed, this could change everything we know about human behavior.""

Sofia smiles, though I know she shares my doubts. But she also feels the excitement of the research. And I don't blame her. Because from now on, the project will be completely different.",2,1735579776.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1hpsf96,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1hpsf96/just_got_back_from_a_cruise/,Just got back from a cruise ,"Wanted to share my experience coming back from a cruise over the holidays. I went on a cruise in August for 18 days and I came back being the heaviest I‚Äôve been. (5‚Äô8‚Äù 211 lbs). I drank, I ate, I enjoyed my trip. I came back so bloated I couldn‚Äôt wear my wedding ring. My husband wanted to treat me to a Christmas cruise as well as celebrating my birthday. Just went to my appointment for my injection and feeling great!  

My experience on the cruise was tough. I went on carnival so the burgers, burritos, dining room are all a fav. Endless ice cream and drinks (husband got the drink package included but he always got me anything I‚Äôd want). I ate what I wanted, but man my appetite was minimal. I‚Äôd get a burger, eat maybe half and I was full until dinner. I skipped breakfast since we slept until 10 am and just rolled with a morning coffee. Dinner service I felt so bad. I‚Äôd order and appetizer, entree and desert. Took maybe 3-4 bites each and was done. It was frustrating since the food was good and I wanted more, but knew the medication was doing its purpose. I still enjoyed my meals, but at smaller amounts. 

I went completely sober from sept up until this trip and boy did that change how I drank. I tried to order drinks, but they just didn‚Äôt hit the same. Before I‚Äôd have a few drinks by the pool, mimosas in the morning, cosmos in the afternoon and wine at dinner. (Hey! It‚Äôs vacation) this time, I was lucky to finish a few. I tried to go hard on my bday to celebrate but after being on the trip for 6 days‚Ä¶ I realized it wasn‚Äôt for me anymore. I knew it‚Äôs affect how I ate on vacation, but was tough balancing the food and knowing how their food made me feel. I never ate out while on the medication so I always prepared my own food. 

First time traveling and coming back feeling lighter, zero bloating and still enjoyed the trip. :)

1hpscxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1hpscxw/3_months_caffeine_free_my_brain_refuses_to_work/,"3 months caffeine free. My brain refuses to work properly, or - at all.","Here's a little report from my caffeine-free journey. Hopefully it will comfort some similarly disturbed.

I'm 35M. Been on some sort of caffeine most my life. Black tea in childhood and adolescence and 1-4 coffees (it varied) a day throughout the last 15 years or so. And lots of dark chocolate. Like a 100g bar a day, even. I'm lean and eat healthily. No other psychoactive substance use.

I‚Äôm three months in, zero caffeine at all. Sleep is still mostly crap. It was like that from the second week on. Can‚Äôt fall asleep for the first hour in bed, at least, even though I‚Äôm tired. Then I wake up a couple times throughout the night and then, finally - very early in the morning, like 5-6ish. I just can't sleep anymore even though it's something I crave the most at that point and I can afford to sleep late. Most nights I manage to get 6-7 hours of this scattered bed-time max. There are some good nights, though, with lots of vivid dreams like I remember I had in childhood. It all goes in waves but I definitely feel my brain recalibrating.

These last few days I felt like my brain had zero dopamine. I had no motivation to do anything. Even watching TV seemed like a chore and I didn't enjoy it at all. Don't feel like socializing and want to isolate myself from people.

Right now my biggest concern is the focus and memory issues, both short- and long-term. I feel like a 5-second memory buffer is making me forget the point of what I was about to say or do just a moment ago.  I can't remember stuff from my long term memory either most days... Feel like someone erased my hard drive. Hugely annoying verbal expression problems, like tip-of-the-tongue feeling when you cannot remember the right word, which happens even a few times within the same sentence. Feeling like an illiterate idiot a lot of the time and trying to limit my social interactions because of that (apart from the aforementioned dopamine related isolation). My vocabulary seems really narrow to me, and I always had an ease of expressing myself in a vivid, colorful manner... I just started talking and my brain generated infinite cascade of words. Now when I try to do that, I just crash and burn after half a sentence. As if my brain ran out of gas...

So overall - a bit dementia-vibes over here, somewhat scary and irritating too, but that might be caused or at least exacerbated by the sleep deficit. Kind of a vicious circle thing.

To sum up - it‚Äôs a shit-show, but I‚Äôm gonna ride it out and never going back to caffeine.

Any similar horror stories? Those brain-related issues are really scary, as I always cherished my good memory, vocabulary and creativity. It's all in the toilet right now and I wonder if I'll ever be ""good"" again. There's something heavy at play, that's for sure, so I'm quite hopeful, but I'd appreciate similar stories to lift my spirits.",3,1735579610.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

We‚Äôve been buying our roasted beans from Kicking Horse coffee for a few years now, and have enjoyed the full bodied flavour of their Grizzly Claw blend. It has been consistently strong and good. This week however, we ought two different bags of grizzly claw beans and these both taste weak‚Ä¶.almost like a Tim‚Äôs coffee-not what we look for in a coffee bean. We are using same grind and amount, and always brew through a chemex filter pour. 

Anyone else finding that Kicking Horse Coffee‚Äôs Grizzly Claw blend has gone to a lighter body taste? Other coffees I buy still taste as full bodied as before, so I don‚Äôt think my tastebuds are the issue here. 

Might have to replace kicking horse if this change in body strength is intended by Kicking Horse.

1hpsbsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/August2025Bumps/comments/1hpsbsr/for_my_fellow_coffee_drinkers/,For my fellow coffee drinkers,"I know coffee is a common aversion, but if you‚Äôre like me and A) aren‚Äôt experiencing that and B) loooooove coffee, I have a hot tip! Might be obvious to some of you, but it wasn‚Äôt to me.

The CDC recommends limiting caffeine during pregnancy to a max of 200 mg a day, about the equivalent of two small cups of coffee. For non-US bumpers, it looks like the WHO recommends a slightly more liberal 200-300 mg a day. Don‚Äôt forget there‚Äôs caffeine in chocolate, soda, tea, etc, though of course coffee is going to pack the biggest punch.

When I started with my fertility clinic, one of the first things my RE said was, ‚Äútalk to me about this 3-4 cups of coffee a day.‚Äù She asked me to get it down under pregnancy guidelines since excessive caffeine can hurt fertility. 

I had SUCH AN ATTITUDE about cutting down on caffeine, y‚Äôall. I spent my first few days pretty angry, headachy and jonesing. 

All that to say, here‚Äôs the hot tip: HALF DECAF. 

I personally don‚Äôt enjoy the taste of decaf coffee at all, so drinking decaf straight is not appealing to me at all. But when you make sure the grounds are mixed together well, it‚Äôs completely eclipsed by the regular coffee flavor. It really helped the transition and I now have about two medium sized cups of coffee a day, which is well under limits and feels like enough to make me happy. My husband started drinking it with me out of solidarity and was equally surprised by how effective regular coffee is at hiding the decaf flavor.

Espresso has less caffeine than drip, but beware: a double shot gets pretty close to maxing you out for the day. I‚Äôve had espresso drinks with the same half-decaf trick and been pretty happy with the results.

Again, this might be obvious to y‚Äôall but it was GROUNDBREAKING to me. Hope it helps somebody!",8,1735579529.0,August2025Bumps,7,0.9,False
1hpsbps,https://www.reddit.com/r/pmp/comments/1hpsbps/passed_pmp_atatat_time_management_and_esl_speakers/,Passed PMP AT/AT/AT - Time Management and ESL speakers,"First of all, I would like to thank everyone who shared their experience. It was a huge help, so I decided to share my experience in case it can help someone else, like ESL speakers or people who have trouble with time management during exams.¬†

**TIME MANAGEMENT**

My English is not that bad. BUT, I spend a lot of time reading the questions and answers to make sure I understand every little detail. I don‚Äôt know if I really need all that time to understand, or if something in my head creates a roadblock because I know English is my second language. Probably the latter.

When I took SH mock exams, I watched the clock and adjusted my pace, speeding up or slowing down as needed. I took the time to think when I could or simply guessed when necessary because I didn‚Äôt feel any pressure to answer correctly.

Thanks to SH, I knew that the clock would be my worst enemy! I knew I would have no time to go back and review the questions. I went into the exam saying, ‚ÄúI will have to adjust‚Äù because I realized 230 minutes were not enough for me. What I think helped me pass the exam is that I identified this risk and was prepared to mitigate it when it materialized (LOL).

I also made sure BEFORE I started the exam to:

* Adjust my chair to the right height because I am short and the monitor is placed way too high on top of a hard drive enclosure.
* Use Ctrl + to enlarge the screen and move the monitor close to my face because I have bad vision.
* Place the keyboard in a way that makes it comfortable for me to press Ctrl + J to highlight.

My ideal plan was to answer the first set in 80 minutes before the clock hit 150. Then split the remaining time 75/75. I told myself that a 5-minute variance would be acceptable and I could catch up if need be. I anticipated that the first set would be the hardest for me.

And it was! I think I had 8-10 questions left when the clock hit 150. I tried to stay calm and continue at my pace, knowing I would have a break soon to adjust my strategy. I was about 12 minutes behind my plan when I took the first break. The first set was hard. My confidence level was low.

I decided to speed up because I didn‚Äôt want to fall further behind. I didn‚Äôt want to bring my confidence level down any further. Now the goal was to maintain my planned pace as a bare minimum. The second set went by very fast. I took my break again. The clock stayed at 64:34. I was 10 minutes behind my plan but I gained a minute or two. I encouraged myself, ‚ÄúGreat job!‚Äù

The third set felt much easier. Halfway through, I still had more than 1 minute left per question. I could breeze through it. But not for long‚Äîthe questions became harder. When I got to question 176, I had about 3-4 minutes left. It was a PERT question that resembled insanity. I selected a random answer and moved on. I didn‚Äôt want to leave 4 questions unanswered. I remembered a guy from YT who suggested reading the question only and selecting the best answer without reading anything else (if you‚Äôre out of time). I did exactly that. I finished with 11 seconds left on the clock. All 180 answered.¬†

If you struggle, figure out what it is you are struggling with and adjust. Run through various scenarios of what can happen during the exam and how you would respond. Stay positive. Take both breaks.

I got a provisional pass on the way out and had to wait 36 hours to get my results -¬† AT/AT/AT. Based on the exam breakdown, I pretty much nailed the People domain.¬†¬†

**EXAM QUESTIONS**

The questions were less wordy than SH. Mostly 2-3 sentences long but not easy. I would say moderate to difficult leaning towards difficult. Situational, situational, situational....

I felt like 75% were agile and hybrid questions. Most likely I am wrong because they say it‚Äôs 50/50 with predictive but it felt like 75% agile/hybrid.¬†

I had 5 drag and drop questions and 2 of them were ‚Äúwtf‚Äù type where I didn‚Äôt even understand what was going on.¬†

I think I had about 5-6 questions where I had to select more than one answer, ‚Äúchoose two‚Äù and ‚Äúchoose three‚Äù type.

One PERT question.

That‚Äôs it. Everything else was purely situational.

**MY PREP**

My prep took about 1 month. I had a lot of time on my hands and studied almost every day.¬†I studied in the following order:

**1st** \-¬† AR‚Äôs 35 hour prep course¬†

**2nd** \- one round of SH exams

mini - 71.4 % with expert

exam 1 - 78% or 85.6% w/o expert

exam 2 - 73% or 83.2% w/o expert

**3rd** \- David McLachlan‚Äôs videos:

200 Agile PMP questions¬†

150 PMBOK scenario based questions

150 PMBOK by DM is when I realized I overstudied because I was overanalyzing everything. I stopped. It was December 24.

I took my test on December 27. Luckily, I have 4 testing centers within a 30-minute drive. I paid and signed up the day before the exam. I didn‚Äôt want to plan ahead and stress out. I showed up 30 minutes earlier as instructed and I was allowed to start the exam right away.

The day before the exam I watched a few DM‚Äôs drag-and-drop videos, rewatched AR‚Äôs mindset, watched Mohammed Rahman‚Äôs mindset, and watched someone else‚Äôs video on what to do when you realize you are running out of time during your exam.

I treated myself to a nice dinner the night before and a nice breakfast the morning of the exam. I brought a cup of iced coffee with me for break time (obviously kept in the locker).¬†",3,1735579523.0,pmp,0,1.0,False

1hpsbcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/1hpsbcz/passed_at_118_with_my_top_15_tips_for_cissp/,Passed at 118 - with my top 15 tips for CISSP!,"Here‚Äôs my **advice** based on my experience with the exam:

1. Just answer the question as presented‚Äîdon‚Äôt add assumptions or overthink.
2. If you can explain a topic clearly to someone else, you truly know it.
3. Zero memorization is required, even for processes like Incident Management or NIST frameworks. If you understand the purpose and flow of each step, that‚Äôs sufficient.
4. Focus more on weaker domains to build confidence and improve your understanding. 
5. Learn to carefully read the questions. Re-read them at least three times to ensure you‚Äôre not missing subtle details.
6. Prioritize sleep, especially a few days before the exam. You may not sleep well the night before due to nerves, so plan ahead.
7. Eat foods that boost brain function‚Äîleafy vegetables, fruits, and proteins. Consider avoiding heavy or negative-energy foods that could make you feel lethargic. Check these resources for brainpower and energy foods: [Harvard Health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/foods-linked-to-better-brainpower) and [Pranic Foods](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/pranic-food).
8. Avoid eating a heavy meal the night before the exam, as digestion can make you feel sluggish.
9. Stay hydrated‚Äîdrink plenty of water.
10. Take breaks during the exam (for example close your eyes for 10 seconds take few deep breaths), ideally after every 40 questions or whenever you feel mentally foggy.
11. Arrive at the test center at least 40 minutes early to settle in.
12. Wear loose, comfortable clothing. Tight clothes can restrict breathing, adding unnecessary stress. Here‚Äôs more on why it matters: [Healthline on Tight Clothes](https://www.healthline.com/health/tight-clothes#defining-too-tight).
13. Stay physically active while studying, even if it‚Äôs just walking outdoors. A healthy body supports a healthy mind.
14. Meditation is incredibly helpful for retention and managing stress. Even with regular practice, my heart rate on exam day was high‚Äîbut it‚Äôs natural. Meditation helps improve your mindset. Here‚Äôs a meditation technique I recommend: [Isha Kriya on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwQkfoKxRvo&pp=ygUKaXNoYSBrcml5YQ%3D%3D). (Any meditation techniques work)
15. Remember, the exam is doable with the right preparation, but you‚Äôll never feel 100% ready. If you‚Äôre scoring in the 50s on practice tests like Quantum Exams, you‚Äôre likely good to go. (QE scores is not a gauge for readiness but as per the success stories 50s looks like the baseline (Also I have seen people who scored around 30s passed)).

I went to my dads for about 4 days and before I left I did all the dishes, and when I come back there are stacks of dishes that haven‚Äôt been washed, meaning my mom used them all since she‚Äôs the only other person that lives in the house. Even though she‚Äôs the one that used all the dirty dishes, she still says that I have to do them. And I can‚Äôt ask why because she‚Äôll freak out and think I‚Äôm trying to start a fight. It‚Äôs like this with everything; she‚Äôll see a cat puke on the floor but won‚Äôt clean it up because she‚Äôs ‚Äústill half asleep and hast had her morning coffee‚Äù and I have to clean it up. Or I‚Äôll leave for a week and she says she can water my plants while I‚Äôm gone and then they‚Äôre all dead when I get back because she said she ‚Äúforgot‚Äù. She‚Äôs complained that she‚Äôs not gonna do the dishes because I dirty more than she does but then now none of it is mine and it‚Äôs still my job to clean all the dishes when I just got back. 

Is there any way I can try to work things out with her and make the house work more even? I honestly doubt that I can since she‚Äôll just get mad at me and complain that she has to go to work all day so ‚Äúit‚Äôs fair that I do the housework‚Äù. She a massive hypocrite and narcissistic.

Went to bed and woke up to matches and they kept coming. I‚Äôve had 24 matches so far, maybe more. I did have some expire. I currently have a dozen active chats. 

My first two matches I unmatched because they weren‚Äôt matching me in chatting effort, or, I didn‚Äôt ask for a date soon enough, whatever, I wasn‚Äôt interested.  
Two others were promising but one lived an hour away. I have major radius issues. 

So I matched with a woman on Christmas Eve but I thought she was a fake. Broken up words, very short replies, didn‚Äôt answer simple direct questions. She mentioned going for a walk so we plan for day after Christmas. I was thinking she wasn‚Äôt real. But she was and actually really cool. She‚Äôs only a year younger than me and I really like her. At the end of the first date (a walk) she asked to hang out again. 

The past weekend I set up four dates. Two on Saturday and two on Sunday. 
First was date #2 with the gal I really like. It was great. We exchanged numbers and are texting each other. 

Second date on Saturday was with a 41 yo. She‚Äôs very beautiful, but something about her millennial vibe isn‚Äôt something I see dating. She gave me her number and wants to hang out again. 

Third date for Sunday I canceled. The woman divulged she had mobility issues, a strong accent, and hearing loss. I had a weird vibe about it all and I said sorry. 

Fourth date on Sunday was essentially a catfish. Sheesh. She was interesting. I almost thought she had a developmental disability. Yeah that‚Äôs mean. But I made the best of it and got a nice buzz on two scotch ales. Sent her some info on pickleball in the area as she just moved here. Told her see her on the court some day.  Bye. 

Now I also have a legally married woman that wants to meet to discuss her ‚Äúarrangement‚Äù. Two other women that want to meet for coffee after the holidays when their kids leave. A couple more prompts to answer. 

I have a strong feeling that when all this clears I will be back to ground zero. 

But honestly I hope the first woman I met is feeling the same as me. I‚Äôd cancel my account in a heartbeat if she wanted make this a go. But I know I need to slow my roll. I might ask her out for NYE.  

In all I really like Bumble so far. The expiring feature is nice. If you change your mind the match just goes away. Seems to be a lot of active women using it. But I can also see nothing coming out of it, as I know this OLD game all too well. ",2,1735579318.0,datingoverfifty,8,0.67,False

Should I mention it to the host?,"I recently stayed in a shared space, from December 22 till December 26th.  The apartment was a two bedroom place where both bedrooms were rented on AirBnb.  The Host didn¬¥t live in the apartment.  There was another guest there when I was there, though I never saw her, I did hear her come in one night.  The apartment was lovely, clean, in a nice area, with a small balcony in my room and at a very good price.  Close to public transportation, stores in the area, I have no complaints at all about the room.  Except for one thing.  Listed in the amenties was use of kitchen, oil, salt, coffee, tea, the usual.  And here is the issue.  There was a bottle of oil, some boxes of tea and coffee on the counter, but there were other things in the cupboards.  There was also bottled water and on the dining room table there was a basket with some candy and chocolates.  There was food in the fridge that was obviously leftovers, but there was plenty of room for the few things I had.  Now here is my question.  Nothing was marked for use of guests, so I ended up not using anything, since I had no way of knowing if it belonged to the other guest, or was for household use.  I did eye the candy a few times, but ended up not taking any for the same reason.  I bought my own water as well.  I was not going to bother someone on Christmas Eve with a fairly unimportant question.  It did not impact my stay in any major way, but it would have been nice to have a specific area for things that were for guests use, either a specific cabinet or marked in some way.  Maybe I was overthinking and the candy was out for guests to eat, or maybe the other guest left it out.  I already left a glowing review, but is that something I should even mention for future guests?  Other people might find it more bothersome that I did.",2,1735579206.0,airbnb_hosts,7,0.75,False

1hps5ib,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1hps5ib/physical_touch_as_a_love_language/,Physical Touch as a 'Love Language',"I would like to preface this with the notion that the whole concept of 'love languages' is a bit silly. There are more than five ways to show and express love and our needs change as frequently as the weather. Sometimes you're stressed and overworked and a simple act of service is what makes you feel truly appreciated and other times a thoughtful gift reassures you that your partner is listening and thinking of you.

If I had to pick just one love language that encompasses the way I prefer to give and receive love, it would be physical touch. I have a lot of anxiety around not being able to hold a conversation and physical touch is often what's easiest for me. If I ever lost my desire to cuddle, I would no longer seek out a partner. The moment I withdraw affection from a relationship is usually the first sign that the relationship is coming to an end.

It's just unfortunate that sometimes people misintrepet what constitutes as loving physical touch.

What if your love language was 'acts of service's and one thing you enjoyed was your partner bringing you a coffee every morning? That sounds great, doesn't it?

But what if they sometimes served it to you without cream and sugar when they know that's how you like it? You would either have to ask them for cream and sugar, get it yourself, or settle for a bitter cup of black coffee.

What if they brought you coffee at 4am in the morning when they know you have a stressful day ahead and weren't planning on getting up till 6am?

What if instead of bringing it to you in the morning, they brought it in the evening before bedtime, and then got upset when you tell them that you don't like drinking coffee before bedtime. ""Well you told me you like it when I bring you coffee, but now you don't want coffee? How am I supposed to know you didn't want coffee when you tell me you like coffee?""

I feel like I could write an entire novel around this analogy and it would still be lost on some people.

But this is why 'physical touch' is my love language. A partner being able to tell from just looking at me - what I'm wearing, my body language, what kind of day I've had - whether I'm in the mood for a playful spank or a tender hug is what truly makes me feel loved.

And I will settle for nothing less in my search for companionship.",1,1735579089.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

It can feel a lot like eating your veggies: you know it‚Äôs good for you, but it‚Äôs not exactly thrilling. But here‚Äôs the thing‚ÄîI‚Äôve been there. I know the struggle. And what if I told you that it doesn‚Äôt have to be like that? What if chasing your goals could actually feel as fun as binge-watching your favorite show or mindlessly scrolling through TikTok at 2 a.m.? It‚Äôs possible. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs easy, but trust me, it can be done. Let me show you how.

Good news‚Äîit‚Äôs totally possible. The trick? Turning self-improvement into a habit so irresistible, you can‚Äôt help but keep coming back for more.

# The Science of Habits: Why We Keep Doing What We Do

Before we dive into the ‚Äúhow,‚Äù let‚Äôs break down what habits actually are. According to researchers, a habit is a behavior triggered by a cue, followed by a routine, and finished off with a reward. Think about it like this:

* **Cue**: You feel bored.
* **Routine**: You grab your phone and start scrolling.
* **Reward**: You get a hit of dopamine from funny videos or social media likes.

Over time, your brain starts craving that dopamine hit, and just like that‚Äîyou‚Äôve formed a habit. The good news? You can hijack this system to make self-improvement just as rewarding.

# Step 1: Start Small (No, Even Smaller Than That)

The biggest mistake people make when diving into self-improvement is trying to overhaul their entire life overnight. They think, *‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to wake up at 5 a.m., meditate, run 5 miles, and learn Spanish before breakfast!‚Äù*

Spoiler alert: it doesn‚Äôt last.

Instead, aim for ridiculously small wins. Want to start reading more? Commit to one page a day. Want to work out? Do a single push-up. These tiny wins seem laughable, but they do something powerful: they build momentum. And once you‚Äôve got momentum, you‚Äôre unstoppable.

# Step 2: Make It Fun

Self-improvement shouldn‚Äôt feel like a chore‚Äîit should feel like something you *want* to do. This means finding ways to make the process enjoyable.

Here are some ideas:

* **Gamify It**: Use apps that track your progress and give you badges or streaks. Seeing those wins stack up can be seriously motivating.
* **Pair It with Something You Love**: Only allow yourself to listen to your favorite podcast when you‚Äôre on the treadmill. Or sip your favorite coffee while journaling.
* **Celebrate the Wins**: Reward yourself for sticking to your habits, even if it‚Äôs something small like watching an episode of your favorite show.

# Step 3: Build a Habit Loop

Remember that cue-routine-reward cycle? You can use it to your advantage by creating your own habit loop. Let‚Äôs say you want to start journaling:

* **Cue**: Place your journal on your pillow.
* **Routine**: Write just one sentence before bed.
* **Reward**: Take a moment to feel good about dumping your thoughts out or reflect on how productive you‚Äôre becoming.

Pro tip: consistency is key. Habits thrive on repetition. Do it daily until it feels weird *not* to do it.

# Step 4: Surround Yourself with Motivation

We‚Äôre social creatures, and our environment matters more than we realize. Want to make self-improvement addictive? Surround yourself with people and things that inspire you.

* **Join a Community**: Whether it‚Äôs an online forum, a fitness class, or a book club, being around like-minded people can keep you motivated.
* **Declutter Your Space**: Create an environment that makes self-improvement easy. Put healthy snacks in sight, leave your workout clothes ready to grab, and stash distractions like your phone when working.
* **Follow the Right People**: Fill your social feeds with content that inspires growth instead of making you feel like you‚Äôre not enough.

# Step 5: Learn to Love the Process

The real magic happens when you stop focusing on the results and start enjoying the process. Instead of thinking, *‚ÄúI‚Äôll be happy when I lose 10 pounds or land that promotion,‚Äù* focus on the daily wins.

Here‚Äôs the thing: self-improvement is a journey, not a destination. The goal isn‚Äôt to be perfect‚Äîit‚Äôs to get just a little better every day. Once you embrace that mindset, the process becomes addictive because you‚Äôre always moving forward.

# A Quick Recap

If you want to make self-improvement addictive:

1. Start with tiny, manageable goals.
2. Find ways to make it enjoyable.
3. Use cues, routines, and rewards to create habits.
4. Surround yourself with motivation.
5. Fall in love with the process, not just the results.

# One Last Thought

Here‚Äôs the truth: nobody wakes up one day suddenly ""hooked"" to self-improvement. It‚Äôs something you build, step by step, win by win. The beauty is, once you start, it snowballs. Those small changes compound, and before you know it, you‚Äôre looking back, amazed at how far you‚Äôve come.

So, what‚Äôs your first tiny step? Whatever it is, start today‚Äîand keep going. Your future self will thank you.",1,1735579039.0,getdisciplined,1,1.0,False

This** [**Letterly**](https://appsumo.8odi.net/yqZJzv) **review might be exactly what you need! Let's dive into how this AppSumo Tool of the Year for 2024 could revolutionize your content creation process.**

* **27 different content formats**
* **15-minute recording limit per session**
* **Works offline and with screen off**
* **One-time purchase vs. yearly subscription**

# Pricing Comparison Table:

|Feature|AppSumo Deal|Regular Plan|

|Cost|$59 (one-time)|$99/year|

I recently took Letterly for a test drive, and *boy*, was I in for a surprise! This isn't your grandmother's voice-to-text app ‚Äì it's like having a personal content wizard in your pocket.

**First Impressions Matter**, and Letterly nails it with a sleek, professional website that actually loads properly (mostly). As someone who's seen enough clunky UIs to last a lifetime, this was a refreshing start.

# The Setup Process

Getting started is smoother than a buttered penguin sliding down an iceberg. Just scan the QR code from their website, and you're whisked away to your platform's app store. *Pro tip*: Start with the free 7-day trial, but immediately cancel the subscription to avoid any accidental charges.

**The Interface** is clean and intuitive, offering three main options:

* AI-powered text editor
* Voice recording button
* Settings gear

# The Magic Behind the Scenes

Here's where things get interesting. I decided to test it with a rant about SaaS products and lifetime deals (because why not?). The app not only captured my rambling perfectly but transformed it into various content formats.

**Content Transformation Options Include**:

* Newsletter formats
* Social media posts
* Email templates (formal & casual)
* Meeting summaries
* Task lists
* Journal entries

# Real-World Testing

I put Letterly through its paces with several tests:

1. **Offline Recording**: Works like a charm, though you'll need internet for the AI magic
2. **Screen-Off Recording**: Perfect for those ""idea in the shower"" moments
3. **Shopping List Creation**: Turned my rambling about groceries into a clean, formatted list

# The Good, The Bad, and The ""Meh""

**The Good**:

* Exceptional voice capture accuracy
* Multiple content format options
* Works offline and with screen off
* Clean, intuitive interface
* One-time purchase option via AppSumo

**The Bad**:

* 15-minute recording limit
* No desktop version
* Markdown-only export
* Still uses ""hope this message finds you well"" (*facepalm*)

# Practical Applications

Imagine walking your dog and dictating your next newsletter, or recording meeting notes that automatically transform into actionable summaries. *That's* the kind of productivity boost we're talking about.

The app shines particularly bright for content creators, business professionals, and anyone who prefers talking over typing (looking at you, hunt-and-peck typists!).

# Value Proposition

At $59 (AppSumo lifetime deal) versus $99/year for the regular subscription, the math isn't just good ‚Äì it's *chef's kiss*. That's like buying a pizza every month versus owning the whole pizzeria.

# Future-Proofing Concerns

The elephant in the room: Will this become obsolete when native OS features catch up? Maybe. But for now, it's solving a real problem with a polished solution.

# What Could Be Better

A few wishes for the Letterly team:

1. **Longer recording limits** (60 minutes would be ideal)
2. **Desktop version** integration
3. **More export format options** beyond Markdown
4. **AI language variations** (goodbye, ""hope this finds you well"")

# The Verdict

With a solid **7.7/10** rating, Letterly isn't perfect, but it's pretty darn close for what it aims to do. It's like having a content assistant who never sleeps, doesn't drink your coffee, and doesn't complain about your midnight brainstorming sessions.

For anyone who:

* Creates regular content
* Attends numerous meetings
* Prefers voice over typing
* Values time efficiency

This tool could be a game-changer in your productivity arsenal.

**Ready to transform your voice into professional content? The AppSumo lifetime deal for Letterly might be your best investment this year. Don't miss out on this Tool of the Year ‚Äì check it out and start creating content the smarter way!**

I truly have found my unicorn family with them, and recently I have just had the WORST luck health wise. I was on the mend form a serious medical event and have been for 2 years- hardly sick at all. However, I just moved to a new location this August (my current job) and have been horribly sick. For example, on my way in today I had an anaphylactic reaction to dairy from a cup of coffee I receive almost every day. I am currently in the ER and had to miss today. Last week I was in the ER again due to respiratory issues and a bad case of a random virus. I have also had strep and a stomach bug all within the last 5 months. I dont know what to do/how to make this up to my family. I know it makes me unreliable as a worker and I hate that because this does not display who I am to have to miss work.

","I'm going to try and recount this as accurately and unbiased as possible to let people give their honest opinions. I need to make sure I'm seeing this situation clearly, and I would appreciate y'all's help. 

- THIS IS LONG. SORRY. CONDENSING MY LIFE DOWN TO A POST IS HARD. -

I [26F, White] and my partner [25M, Indian] have been together for four (nearly five!) years. Our relationship hasn't always been the smoothest - nothing crazy like cheating or secret kids (truly), but we've both had to help one another deal with and manage our trauma and emotions since we met. My partner encouraged me to go to therapy, learn to communicate, and open up after a childhood of ""rug sweeping"". In turn, I encouraged him to take care of himself physically, go back to school, and now, get higher employment. 

--- extra info skip to timeline if ya don't got the TIME

- I'm an only child. Parents wanted more kids, couldn't have'em, and did not desire to adopt any kids. 

- I grew up in most children's dreamland, as many tell me. A horse farm, with rolling green hills and clean air. A rotation of 4-6 dogs, and 2-3 cats. The house was always stinky and frequently had poops in it, but everyone loves pets, right?

- I grew up riding horses from a young age - I didn't like it, but my mom insisted. She used to give me lessons and yell, which is what I remember the most. I also competed - for her, I'll admit. I do not have a single fond memory of competing outside of my bond with my horse.

- Frequently switched schools all throughout my childhood which made the isolation of living on the farm difficult; I didn't have a single age appropriate ""friend"" until high school. It also made my education difficult, especially because the ""schools"" my parents sent me to were inside church basements, or run by individuals without a teaching license. I spent 2 years out of school from grades 5-7, so my mom and I could take a 2 week trip (yeah, your guess is as good as mine?). 

---- 

Here is a TIMELINE of what I perceive to be relevant events:

Late 1990's - I'm unfortunately yeeted into existence after a traumatic birth that left my mom nearly dead. This is where the trouble begins, I suspect. 

2001 - My grandfather (mother's father) passes away quite young (mid 60's). Despite my young age, I sense my dad can't handle it. I comfort my mom, telling her about angels, and everyone marvels at me being ""so mature for my age."" This sets a tone for the parental dynamic - I comfort mom, my dad emotionally withdraws, my mother lashes out, we both attempt to compensate. My dad claims my mother was not the same woman he married after this. 

2001 - I begin to get frequent night ""terrors"" where I wake up screaming and sobbing, or on the floor of my room. My mom gets me a dream catcher. It must have caught the good dreams by mistake, because it doesn't help. 

2002 - I throw a tantrum in a chocolate store - I don't think I wanted candy, I remember wanting to go HOME. And my mom just kept talking and telling me to wait after we had gone clothes shopping all day (I hated all the fabrics and changing clothes). This tantrum is brought up for the rest of my life. 

2002 - a ""friend"" of mine steals my sweater at school. My mom marches in and SCREAMS at everyone during the middle of the school day, including the teachers.The kids ostracised me even more after that. I vow never tell my mom about a real problem I am having again.  

2005 - I begin crying myself to sleep every night reliably. I look forward to my ""nightly cries"" as I called it. I become an insatiable reader, reading at a 12th grade level easily. I am never without a book and easily go through entire series in a week. 

2005 - I officially get unrestricted internet access and learn all there is to know about... Everything. Even things a kid shouldn't. I love gaming on the PC as everything is safe when I do.

2008 - If you know, you know. I'm now about 10 years old. I constantly feel sad. My parents fight often, and frequently have me weigh in on fights. My mom threatens to divorce my dad for ""someone better"" at least every 3 months. Mom lashes out - gives silent treatment for weeks - moves on becomes the pattern in the house. I throw myself into my academics to try and have something to hold onto. 

2008 - I become proud of myself because I can now determine based on the creak of the floor boards if mom is angry. The whole house revolves around her mood. She says she's going through menopause but will not seek medical help. 

2010 - My parents take me on a once and a lifetime trip to the ocean. It's beautiful. I swim with rays and dolphins and learn about proper ocean conservation. My mom breaks out into hives on the way back, and despite being in such pain she is writhing in bed for 3 days, she will not seek medical help. I remember her screaming more than I remember the rays. 

2012 - I'm beginning high school, and I'm terrified. I tell my mom I feel catatonic. I taste nothing. Feel nothing. Want nothing. I'm scared. I tell her I started cutting myself to feel something. She tells me to ""stop being so silly"". I do not mention if again. 

2012 - I realize I'm bisexual. This raises problems at my Catholic high school and my home. I don't tell anyone. 

2012 - I begin vomiting every morning due to stress. This is a symptom I still live with to this day. 

2013 - I am 15. I am hurt at a party by people I thought were my friends. I make sure to shower well to get their hands off my skin. I don't tell a soul. Small towns don't do well with scars like this. 

2013 - I begin to stop eating. I lose weight quickly. My mom congratulates me on losing weight. I love the thrill of seeing how long I can go without eating. I begin smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee to survive. 

2013 - I work two jobs to be out of the house as much as possible. I buy a car (a necessity in the boonies).

2015 - I am 17. I meet my first partner. He and I start dating. I tell him about my sexuality. 3 months in, he comes out as transgender and transitions to she. She outs me to our friends, saying ""being transgender is a way bigger deal than being bi, get over yourself."" Her parents accept and love her unconditionally.

2016 - I graduate high school just as my parents hear a ""rumour"" I'm bisexual. I deny it, but my mom tells me she will never support me marrying a woman and ""we should call it here"" for our relationship. I don't hear from my parents from months, leaving me stuck as they promised to help with rent while I'm at university.

2016 - I move 5 hours away (by car) for university. My friends I've made at uni, loans, and working two part jobs gets me through financially. I refuse to drop out.

2016 XMas - Mom pops back up like nothing happened. No apology. Wants me home for Xmas. I go. While home, I tell them I don't want kids (consistent since I was a kid about this). My mom says ""why did we even have you then?""

2016 remainder - My then-girlfriend insists I've cheated on her, as I fell asleep while on the phone with her and ""moaned"". I was taking a new sleeping medicine - she knew this. She tries to flirt with my new uni friends, even going so far as to make a fake Grindr profile to stalk them. She ""gets revenge"" by trying to cheat on me with a random man, but is assaulted in the process. She blames me and attempts to check out early on her life hotel booking. I end things with her and call her parents, who save her life. I cut her off.

2018 - While helping me move, my mom begins screaming at my roommate. The police are called. This incident almost destroys my relationship with my closest friend from university. My mom never apologises. 

2019 - I miss Xmas with my parents for the first time, offering to come down on the 26-27th instead. My mom tells me not to bother, if it's not ""on the day"" she ""doesn't give a fuck about my half-assed attempts to visit"". 

2019 - I date a man my parents love. He is white, religious, and wants kids. He is also mean, nasty and controlling. He begins demanding I get off BC after 6 weeks together. I dump his ass. My mom sobs when I tell her. 

2020 Spring - My partner and I meet as the panny hits. Luckily, we randomly live 2 houses from each other. That's how we met, when he helped me carry a very heavy box out to the curb. 

2020 Spring -  I graduate with honours from my program. 

2020 Summer -  We briefly break up for two weeks because I was toxic. I resolve I want to be better, and my partner and I get back together. I begin therapy, working out, and smoking weed more often. I also begin a Master's degree.

2022 - I am diagnosed with CPTSD. My partner is supportive but my parents do not ask further. I try to discuss my childhood with my parents but they say I've ""abandoned them"" for my partner and chosen family (from uni). 

2022 - My parents meet my partner, but dislike his (admittedly) messy hair and clothes. He is kind, but doesn't always know how to present himself (yet!). My partner supports me being childfree, and tells my parents he has the snip snip so there is no kiddies. They do not like this. 

2022 - Ya girl gets her Master's! Couldn't have done it without my partner who talks me through countless panic attacks. 

2023 - An ongoing fight I've had with my parents comes to a head. After they say something racist in a restaurant that makes everyone uncomfortable, my friend politely asks them to refrain. They become irate, saying ""how dare we"" correct them. I beg them to just *try* to be respectful, but they say ""we need to give them grace"". 

2024 - After dating happily for four years, my partner get a huge promotion to move to a new city. I must remain behind in previous city for work (for now!), but make plans to move with partner once I find employment. I tell my parents. My parents sit me down, and say they don't like my partner. I ask for reasons. They give the following: 

- He was unemploymed for 8 months during the height of the pandemic (true). 
- It has taken him 6 years to finish his bachelor's degree due to funding and mental health issues. However, he is set to graduate with a double major very soon, so I think that is a win. His grades have soared with my help, just like my ability to communicate has with his. 
- He enjoys spending his money on restaurants, and smokes weed (true, but so do I). 
- We would be living 6 hours away from them by car, which is too far (again, they live in the middle of nowhere). 
- He once slept in when I shovelled the driveway - I let him sleep in on purpose! My parents happened to call to chat while I was shovelling, so I answered and kept going. They asked where he was, and I said I let him sleep. They said they ""lost all respect for him"". 

After this, they gave me an ultimatum - them, their money (a lot of it), and their support, or my partner. They will want nothing to do with me if we become engaged, just like if I was to marry a woman. 

Initially, I was done, and going to tell them DON'T LET THE PROVERBIAL DOOR SLAP YOUR ASS ON THE WAY OUT - but my therapist said I should reconsider before making such a big decision. My partner is torn up that I'm having to choose between them, but I don't feel this is his fault. 

My therapist said this kind of mentality is very common among Boomers, and it might be worth it to consider their concerns regarding my partner.

Another night, another murder. Detective Rachel Lee was at her favorite diner, having her usual meal, a cheeseburger and a coffee, when the call came in. A murder at 304 Jorgennsen Suites. Getting in was easy. She watched as two enforcers barged in to search the premise. As soon as they both came out and taped it off, she slipped in behind the back of the one left to guard the scene and dug through the apartment. A lone body, Chioxang Yang, shot once. Low caliber, a pistol or a revolver. Around his body was a heart drawn in red lipstick. The tube of lipstick was left behind, and on it was a fingerprint, classified as fingerprint BD. And on the counter nearby was a note, half burned that said ""Chioxang, be mine."" She went through his files, building a profile for both him and his partner, she dug through his v-mails to look for a potential affair, looked through his address book, checked his last call, and got his employment contract. One trip to City Hall to access citizen records and fill out the profiles a bit more, and she got to work.

Rachel went to his workplace and asked around. She checked their fingerprints and pulled out their employee records. Nothing. She found and asked his spouse for help, but was met only with reproach. No useful information, and Lee had already confirmed the spouse's fingerprints didn't match the lipstick. His last call had been from his boss, Joshua. She went to ask him, but couldn't get in to see him. Corpo Echelon crap. She broke in at night to search Joshua's apartment, and turned up nothing. She decided to wait until the day and see if she could catch him at the burger joint where they worked together. In the meantime, she went to check the last lead she could think of: A v-mail from someone named Saul warning Chioxang that someone was getting suspicious, and that they would have to delay their meeting. That sounded promising. But as with the rest of her leads, it ultimately amounted to nothing.

Finally, out of leads and in desperation, Rachel broke back into the crime scene to steal his address book. She figured that the perp most likely knew the victim. A couple of hours at City Hall, a tall cup of coffee, and a lot of printing off civilian profiles. But if one of them matched on prints, it will have been worth it.

She was about halfway done with the address book, on someone named Finn, when a new call came down. Another murder. She decided to take a break, grab a snack, and check out this new scene while she let the other one develop. But when she heard where it was, she was shocked. 103 Zhong Heights. One floor down from her own apartment. This one was a little too close to home. She waited patiently, watched as the Enforcers rushed the scene only to leave a few minutes later, leaving her the opening to slip inside once more. Then she set to work again. But when she saw the body, she froze.

The same heart, drawn in lipstick, the same ""Be mine"" note, the same murder weapon. Low caliber, single pistol shot. She checked the lipstick for prints and her suspicions were confirmed when she received the BD pattern prints back. A serial killer. She searched for an I.D. and was surprised to see a familiar name. Finn. Finn English. It took her a moment to realize this might be the same Finn from the first victim's address book, but when she did, she set about looking for a connection. Spouse knew nothing or would say nothing, the workplace was a bust, and the only two leads Lee found were an unknown caller that was their last call, and a receipt from Aigner's Hotel. Hotel first, Rachel decided.

When she got there, Rachel asked around pretty quickly, but none of the bar staff had seen anything strange. She snuck into the back to look at surveillance, but was quickly chased out. And as she was leaving, she spotted the mail room. On a hunch, Rachel went in, checking every mailbox for prints. And it wasn't long before she felt her luck shift. There, on the mailbox for 1101 Aigner's Hotel, was prints that sent back BD. Immediately, she broke into the mailbox, almost getting caught in the process. It was empty. She raced up to the 11th floor, knocked on the door and questioned the occupant, but got nothing back. That was fine. She broke in later, and scanned for prints. But these were not the prints she was looking for. These didn't match. Not a single hit in the entire apartment.

But that begged the question. Why were the killer's fingerprints on this person's mailbox? Postal worker? Employee at the hotel? A glitch in the Matrix? It is unknown. And until the being who controls Rachel returns from work, it will remain unknown. Her next stop though? City Hall.

1hprwj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hprwj5/my_wife_f33_gets_stressed_about_things_that_are/,My wife (F33) gets stressed about things that are suddenly emergencies and cannot communicate without blaming me (m38),"My wife and I got along pretty well until we had kids (2 boys, 5 and 3), and now we seem to fight a lot. She tends to expect a lot out of everybody and also has ridiculous standards and then gets angry at me when I can't live up to them.

I've been sick this week which makes the problem 100x worse but she does this regardless of whether either of us is sick.

A few examples: The other morning we both had a day off but we're both trying to get over our sicknesses. She's got a cold and I'm getting over a flu (fever and all). That morning, well before any of us wanted to be awake, our youngest had diarrhea, she woke up and asked me to take care of it. I got up, cleaned him up, put him in his bed with a few toys, checked on the older kid who was sufficiently entertained, and went back downstairs to sleep on the couch (all of our bedrooms are upstairs). Since we're sick I've been sleeping on the couch downstairs (it's just easier when everybody's coughing, tossing and turning). 

Since the boys eventually did get up, she claims I just left them there for her to take care of. I try to explain to her that, no, I tried to buy both of us some time to sleep. She goes in on how we can't just let them sit there hours after they wake up and they need breakfast and you can't just leave them there. She accused me of just wanting more sleep. *Why is that wrong? I'm sick!?*

I try to explain to her that, actually, they won't explode. The oldest can make both of them cereal just fine, and she doesn't need to stress about these things she can send them down instead of working herself up. She tells me that I'm being selfish by not immediately tending to the boys' every whim at the ass-crack of dawn and therefore making it her problem.

She's not having it. But this isn't isolated. She gets this way constantly. This is just the latest.

When she decides it's ""time"" for something to happen, we're on her timetable and I'm delinquent if I need a beat. But god forbid she wants to sleep in and make the kids my problem that's her taking her motherly and well deserved time.

I try to give the kids more freedom and space so that both her and I have room to breathe but whenever I do, she takes over and acts like I left them to be her problem. That's not true and I explain it to her constantly. She feigns ignorance. ""Why didn't you communicate that?"" .. because you were sleeping and I thought we could get more sleep? Like it's an impossible question. 

I feel like I'm always on edge because if it's not *her* way, I'm somehow violating her.

I'll spend an afternoon cleaning the house and when she comes home she'll tell me the house is a mess and start re-mopping areas I've already mopped that day, because inevitably there's a new smudge somewhere because we have two young boys in the damn house. She'll always use the phrase ""total mess"" which deflates me. It doesn't matter how much I do I somehow never do it right or well enough.

If I showed her this post she'd immediately tell me that actually I'm lazy and I don't really do anything. Then she'll start trying to compare all the things she does for us and the family and I keep trying to tell her maybe don't fucking kill yourself over everything, life will wait.

She used to come home sometimes and see dishes in the sink. She wouldn't even take off her jacket or say hello before starting on dishes. She'd give me a cold shoulder like I left dishes for her- even if I had planned on doing them later. It doesn't cross her mind that when I pick up the kids at night, make them dinner, get them in bed, that by the time she gets home I might want 5 fucking minutes to sit down before getting elbow deep in dishes. She'll say she ""doesn't do that anymore"" and I guess she doesn't since I had such a long fight over her doing this that she's finally backed down. But it's an example of where she's coming from.

If something comes up in her mind, it's an emergency that everybody should have already tended to, and how dare we leave it for her. The problem is there's no end to emergencies. 

I don't dispute she does more around the house than I do, but that's because she doesn't fucking sit down or rest or have hobbies she just fucking won't stop.

Any time I want a nap or time to myself she gives me guilt like she's the one making all the sacrifices. (Mind you finances are not evenly split by a long shot, I pay the mortgage, utilities, internet, oil). She tells me that split doesn't count because she has the kids more. she works 32 hours a week and has the kids when she's not working. I work 40 hours a week and have the kids when I'm not working. 

When she's not home, it's like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I can give the kids activities and then relax without wondering about what task I forgot to do or didn't do right.

Yesterday morning she vented that she wanted to go a day without cleaning ""shit"" off the toilet because the kids are sick now too. Diarhrea every few hours. I explain that if she's at her witts end, that she doesn't need to clean the toilet every 12 minutes and that she can just let us be sick for a day and we can clean the toilet later in the day since they're just going to poop again.

She looked at me like I had 3 heads. ""You can't have a poop on a toilet, why won't you just clean it?!?!"" and I was like ""wait I never said I wouldn't clean it, I was saying maybe stop making everything an emergency...?""

She cannot communicate without underhandedly insulting me. ""It's a mess in here"" = ""why haven't you cleaned."" 

When she got up yesterday, she asked (demanded) I give the sick child a shower. I knew he was gonna poop again in minutes, so I took the sick kid back upstairs and we laid down for a while. Figured I'd throw him in the shower when I take mine. She got mad that we were resting, and left to get coffee without offering me one (which is her passive agressive way of telling me, once again, I'm not living up to her ridiculous standards). Why was the shower an emergency? He didn't have shit on him. Oh, because I decided it wouldn't be a bad idea for him and I to get a little more rest at 8 in the morning, and so now the world was *her problem*. That's the emergency. 

This morning, I called her about something and asked how she was feeling. She told me that there's ""shit everywhere"" in the house. Yeah, they're christmas presents. Most of which she got (and I think she got too many, so why is she **** at me!?). She says ""Well why didn't you put it all away?"" as though I wasn't sick with a fever this week, barely able to get out of bed. As though I didn't do a deep clean of the kitchen and dining room just the day before, handwashing dishes, mopping floors, doing 3 loads of laundry. No- I didn't find new hiding places for the hundred christmas toys she bought and now that's my fault.

How do I communicate with her? This is beyond ridiculous.

TL;DR: My wife gets instantly stressed about things which creates emergencies that she then offloads onto me and holds them against me when I don't manage them immediately. Whenever I leave a vacuum whether in chores or giving the boys space, she immediately takes it up as though I've left it for her. How do I communicate?",0,1735578426.0,relationships,37,0.47,False

According to his new bet he is now 9% sure that ASI won't happen by 2027.,"Gary Marcus' [new bet](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/where-will-ai-be-at-the-end-of-2027) is the most insane goalpost shift I have ever seen.

**Background**

In 2022, [Gary Marcus bet](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/dear-elon-musk-here-are-five-things?r=8tdk6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true) that we wouldn't have AGI by 2029. He said he would agree that AGI was achieved if it could do THREE of the five following thing:

* ""In 2029, AI will not be able to watch a movie and tell you accurately what is¬†going on (what I called [the comprehension challenge](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/what-comes-after-the-turing-test) in *The New Yorker*, in 2014). Who are the characters? What are their conflicts and motivations? etc.
* In 2029, AI will not be able to read a novel and reliably answer questions about plot, character, conflicts, motivations, etc. Key will be going beyond the literal text, as Davis and I explain in [*Rebooting AI*](http://rebooting.ai).
* In 2029, AI will not be able to work as a competent cook in an arbitrary kitchen (extending [Steve Wozniak‚Äôs cup of coffee benchmark](https://www.fastcompany.com/1568187/wozniak-could-computer-make-cup-coffee)).
* In 2029, AI will not be able to reliably construct bug-free code of more than 10,000 lines from natural language specification or by interactions with a non-expert user. \[Gluing together code from existing libraries doesn‚Äôt count.\]
* In 2029, AI will not be able to take arbitrary proofs from the mathematical literature written in natural language and convert them into a symbolic form suitable for symbolic verification.""

In 2024, he bet that we wouldn't get ASI by 2027 and gave a list of 11 things he thought would indicate ASI.

**The new bet**

You can read it [here](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/where-will-ai-be-at-the-end-of-2027). He has basically taken four requirements from his AGI test and added six requirements from his ASI test. Here is a comparison against his 2022 AGI test (he refers to it as his '2023' bet for completely inexplicable reasons). He has:

1. Reduced the amount he is willing to bet down by two orders of magnitude ($100,000 -> $2,000).
2. Brought the date up by two years (from 2029 to 2027)
3. Added six new items that he previously classified as indicating ASI not AGI.
4. Changed the odds he was will to give from 1:1 (indicating that he was 50% sure he would be right) to 10:1 (indicating that he is now 9% sure that he is right).
5. He changed the threshold for passing the test from achieving 60% of the tasks (3 out of 5) to achieving 80% of the tasks (8 out of 10).

Basically, he has gone from being 50% sure that AGI won't happen by 2029 to being 9% sure that ASI won't happen by 2027. If you add in the reduction in the amount he is willing to bet and the increase in the threshold for passing the test its an even greater reduction in confidence.

The second time he never recovered. He wasn't vaccinated because he was on that side of the political spectrum. 

I miss my dad so much. He wasn't perfect by any means but I didn't appreciate him enough. He was my biggest hype man but also my biggest critic. Now I only have my own standard to uphold and I don't like being the man of the house now. I'm 40 and weeping like a 10 year old boy. 

My partner is already exhausted with my grieving. Their dad has been gone 5 years this year. I'm trying to put myself back together but I'm spending NYE alone because my partner is making plans I have no interest in. I guess I cannot expect anyone to hold me while I grieve, because I will be trying to spend my first NYE feeling my dad from the other side of the veil. 

I will be questioning how much of him is left in me, in my shattered memory. I think I made him proud. I told him before he passed of my plans to start a coffee shop and he loved it, thought it was a great idea. I have 5 years in the industry, behind the bar. I give good service. But I was kicked out of my shop, my home, when it got bought out and I was done being pumped for info on how they should run their business. 

2025 is gonna suuuuuuuuck. I have to learn to embrace the suck and not let anyone see me suffer because they're exhausted with me, I'm exhausted with me. I just want my integrity back. I feel like I've been a wet blanket since the job loss in Nov 23. I guess I need to figure out how to get funding for a coffee shop. Where to learn business and how to make connections. All of that while navigating a recent autism diagnosis. I can do it. I have no choice.

I hope if woo woo spirit stuff is real, that my dad is proud of me. But I know he wouldn't want me suffering like this. ",2,1735578092.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

1hprnuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1hprnuw/am_i_25f_too_far_gone_how_do_i_handle_resentment/,Am I (25F) too far gone? How do I handle resentment for my partner (26M)? (Together for 5 years) ,"TLDR: I have resentment for my partner. We have talked about the things that have caused my resentment. He is making changes to try and help why I resent him. Although, any time I see those changes I get upset. I figure it is because I wonder why he never did it in the past and why he only tried to help when I ask for it. How do I get over the resentment when I see him trying? Am I too far gone? GIVE ME THE TOUGH ANSWERS! I WILL TRY ANYTHING! (except therapy, I have looked and we can't afford it)

My partner and I have gone through our ups and downs. I'm not sure if our disagreements are similar to other relationships but I do believe I have grown some resentment from our past disagreements. I believe that I carry a large mental load of the relationship. I do most around the house, I work 3 jobs (1 is coaching and I consider that a passion but I do make $19k a year from it), I pay all the bills (he contributes to the bank account for sure, works full time salaried, I just make sure everything is paid and figure out how to allocate our money). I don't have to work 3 jobs, but one is a passion and I consider it ""me"" time and the other really helps float us to the next check. The reason I think I have too much resentment is that even when we have gone over things like ways he can help around the house, I get upset. Anytime I see him offer to do things I usually do, I just get pissed off. I understand he wants to help but I can't seem to get past the mindset of ""why do it now? I have been doing all of this by myself for 5 years."" Or I have to explain how to do it over and over again. (skip examples for a quicker read)

Example 1: I planned our entire wedding by myself (not hiring a coordinator was a HUGE mistake, but saved us \~$3k) and asked for simple input from him like ""which first dance song would you like?"" and ""what colors are you okay with?"" I stressed to him how I wanted to practice our first dance but he never wanted to and last minute, 2 weeks out from our wedding, he mentioned practicing. At that point I was so busy with everything else that still needed to be done that I just got angry. I remember telling him the only thing he had to do was find his suit and I would cover everything else. I ended up finding his suit too. Our wedding was great, he really enjoyed himself, but there were a few things I asked him to prioritize, suit, vows, and first dance so that I could have my dream day too. I just feel sad when I think about what it could have been if he would have put in effort to give me all of my wishes too. Regardless, it was still a good time.

Example 2: This weekend I had a volleyball tournament Saturday and Sunday. Sunday is usually my day to clean the house and meal prep. Yes, I have even gone as far as figuring macros for him to lose weight, suggesting dietary choices he will like, sending meals on MyFitnessPal and helping with macro tracking (this statement is full of resentment but I am leaving it in the post so readers can understand how and why I feel so much resentment). I was so tired, he knew it, and offered to help meal prep. I woke up from my nap after the tournament and heard him cooking and just got so angry. Then I started to make my breakfast for the week, I started hashbrowns and then I needed to wash sheets and towels because when he said he was washing laundry I forgot to tell him to wash sheets and towels too, when I finished loading the wash, I came back to the kitchen where my hashbrowns had been cooking very slowly before I left, but they were now burning. My hashbrowns were literally brown and black in the pan right next to where he was working, he didn't even think to move them off the burner or pop his head in and ask while I was filling the wash right next to our kitchen.

Example 3: Yesterday I worked both jobs, 4:30 wake up for gym, arrive to first job at 7:00, head home at 2:30, headed to next job at 3 and worked until 11:15. On my way home we were on the phone and he said he was getting in to bed. I mentioned that I did not have time to make my preworkout and coffee like I usually do the night before, he didn't even offer to make it for me. But I know that if he would have offered I would have got mad. I just wanted to be in bed by 11:30 so we could go to the gym the next morning. I did not end up going to bed until after 12 because I had to get my clothes ready for work and pack my gym bag (I shower at the gym and go straight to work), make our preworkout and coffee and find gym clothes. I do all of this nightly so I can sleep the extra 20 minutes every morning.

So anyway, there's occurrences like these almost daily and I just get upset over and over and I am not sure how to fix it. Before we got married I told myself there was a lot I just had to get used to, that I just had to accept my role in a relationship is to be the woman. But I feel like both, and it really sucks. Now I am worried I will hate him for the rest of our marriage and he wants kids. I really don't feel comfortable bringing children in to a situation where they won't see their parents loving each other. Only brings trauma and shapes how their relationships will be in the future. I would hate for my children to feel any type of the feelings I am feeling now. I also don't want kids because what if I end up having to do everything for them, for him, and have no time for myself? Will I even have time for coaching or working a second job to give us that little bit of extra spending money every week? I really feel like I am just not trying hard enough to save our relationship but I don't think I have anything else to give. At this point, the effort it takes to communicate these issues with him is almost too much, let alone trying to find a solution and execute effort in solving the problem.",2,1735577827.0,relationshipadvice,1,1.0,False

Yep lets begin a loud gathering at 4 pm w a baby and autistic toddler and see how that goes!! 
I get that this stage is hard, im exhausted bc the baby wakes up at night, my fucking back hurts so bad from wearing him and having no time for exercise or PT which would combat the pain, the house is cluttered bc baby and kid‚Ä¶ but with my daughters challenges i worry that this is how it will be forever.  Wiping her butt forever, never having any non completely essential items in my house, locks on everything, and worst of all the attitude towards her brother.  I get that all siblings fight but i guess i just see another layer to all this bc shes autistic.  I cant leave her unsupervised for even a minute yhese days bc if theres a coffee cup within reach its on the floor in pieces, curtains are pulled down, etc.  im just so fucking tired and i feel like theres no light at the end of the tunnel.  I feel so sad that my son might be in danger from her and that eventually i wont be able to be present w him bc his sisters needs will just take over our whole life.  None of my most basic and non negotiable needs are met ever anymore.  My daughters needs arent met bc our house is too small and we dont have a fenced yard or pool (the two things she loves are playground and swimming).  How do i live another 40 or 50 years this way?",1,1735577689.0,breakingmom,1,1.0,False

Curious what people think these neighborhoods will look like in 5 years. 

Avondale has changed so much, but sometimes it feels like its heyday is in the past. 
* Ferus seems empty several nights a week. 
* Miracle Pizza is good but doesn‚Äôt have the nostalgic feeling of Post Office. 
* Parkside has a great space and I actually like the change to a nice cocktail bar, since 41st is still a nice low-key place, but I heard a rumor someone was leaving to be beverage director at a new bar downtown, so I‚Äôm worried they‚Äôll suffer and dry up. 

Woodlawn has such great infrastructure: it feels like a real neighborhood.
* Two and three-story buildings, housing within walkable distances, but it‚Äôs obviously still ‚Äúup and coming.‚Äù
* Two Dough Girls is currently closed but rumored to be opening in somewhere downtown. 
* Slutty Vegan closed for like 6 months but finally reopened under new ownership. 
* McDonald‚Äôs closed (and that one seems like a death knell if a big chain like that doesn‚Äôt want to stay open).
* It seems like it could genuinely be one of Birmingham‚Äôs best areas if it could fill up and stay filled, compared to Avondale‚Äôs surrounding desert of warehouses. 

Forest Park is obviously full of money and therefore full of patrons for any businesses, so I hope specialty places like Shoppe have what it takes to stay for a long time. 
* Red or White is a great wine bar/shop, they seem to do well consistently. 
* Juniper is so Instagrammable that it brings in a lot of people from outside the neighborhood, so they should do fine for years to come. 
* Rougaroux seems like they stay pretty busy, I just hope the expenses of their Lane Park location don‚Äôt force them to close Forest Park. 
* Seems like a coffee shop would do really well in FP, like another O‚ÄôHenry‚Äôs, June, or East Pole. 
* There‚Äôs not much commercial space for businesses, so I wonder if any other houses will be converted to businesses in the same way that Jay and Mark created Shoppe.

For this method, are the dowels unnecessary and could I just glue the boards together, keeping in mind that I need the shelf to support the weight of a microwave?

Hi all,
I purchased a new Sage Barista Touch Impress and I encountered the following issues:
- I tried 4 types of freshly roasted beans and on 2 of them it seems that the grinder has problems with the grinding - it gets jamed and not grind, and sounds different. All the beans are medium roasted (5-6 out of 10 roast level)
- The internal burr was set to default setting - number 6. For all the beans I followed the machine instructions for dialing in each type, in order to obtain a decent espresso shot.
- I tried to clean the inside grinder, I vacuumed all the beans and ground coffee and I observed that the internal burr rotated to number 5 by itself. How could this happen? I never removed the wire to rotate the ring from the default number 6 setting.
- I have tried the coffee beans that are jamming the grinder in my old Phillips coffee machine and they grind fine, without any problems.
My questions are:
- does the grinding machine has defects? 
- Am I doing something wrong? 
- Is this a common issue?
- Do I need to return the machine?
I feel like I‚Äôm loosing my wits, please help!

I was curious on whether anyone has ever thought about, or ever considered, potentially creating a Fediverse equivalent to platforms like:  

- Ko-fi  
- Patreon  
- Gumroad  
- LiberaPay  
- Buy Me a Coffee  
- Web Monetization (e.g., Coil)

What I‚Äôm imagining is a **decentralized platform** that allows users across the Fediverse to **directly tip or support creators**, all without relying on plugins or third-party integrations.  

For instance, I know that creators on platforms like PeerTube can add plugins for cryptocurrency or payment solutions, but these require additional configuration or technical know-how. 

What I‚Äôm suggesting is a straightforward tipping platform built directly into the Fediverse ecosystem that doesn‚Äôt depend on plugins‚Äîjust a seamless way to support creators on ALL Fediverse platforms.

To clarify upfront:  
- **I am NOT a ‚Äúcrypto bro.‚Äù** I‚Äôm not here to promote any cryptocurrency or blockchain agenda‚ÄîI‚Äôm just thinking about user-friendly, decentralized solutions.  
- While I AM open-minded about crypto-based approaches, I feel there‚Äôs potential for a non-crypto, user-first Fediverse tipping system.

What do you all think?  
- Has this idea been explored?  
- Are there any projects in the works that aim to address this?  
- Do you think it‚Äôs feasible or even a good fit for the Fediverse ethos?

1hpr9gh,https://www.reddit.com/r/paroxetine/comments/1hpr9gh/paxil_withdrawal/,Paxil withdrawal ,I‚Äôve been coming off Paxil for the last 2 months. I had all the physical symptoms but I‚Äôm noticing that I feel very disconnected right now. Not just from my partner but also from friends. It‚Äôs like I just can‚Äôt interact with people right now at all. Even sitting having lunch or coffee with my best friend feels exhausting and mentally I don‚Äôt feel like myself. Is this a symptom of withdrawal from this medication? Also side note my doctor put me on Wellbutrin while coming off Paxil (to help with the withdrawal and depression that can happen as a result). Trying to figure out if this disconnect is Paxil withdrawal or this new medication. ,2,1735576804.0,paroxetine,1,1.0,False

1hpr5ev,https://i.redd.it/f5ytjmh0k0ae1.jpeg,A solo backpacking trip (part 1),"There is nothing more peaceful then the meditation of a solo trip after a long year working. I had been a little burnt out by the time August rolled around having worked since the previous October saving all my vacation for this one trip. It would be a nice get away a good escape from reality for a while.

The drive up was uneventful I took the highway north through the beautiful trees heading into wild country. I stopped for gas at a pump along the way, but even though the place seemed out of place and very old I wasn't concerned. Chatting with the cashier while my tank was filled gained me some information on the local highlights. The falls, the lake for fishing and of course the park where I'd be spending the next week. 

""I'll warn you kid, there's been a huge storm and lots of trees are down. It might be slow going to get into the park. Just be careful and keep your whits about you for dead trees."" He said as I was paying for my coffee and gas, getting ready to head out again.

""Thanks, I will!"" I excitedly said as I got back in my car and hit the highway tunes blaring country music as the emoty highway wound through the brilliant green of late summer foliage. The next 40 minutes were pure bliss. An empty highway, the midday sun and my favorite songs carrying me towards my vacation I had waited so long for.

I pulled into the park in the afternoon and was parking next to the office behind an RV as I got a call from a dear friend. 

""Did you make it?"" She asked excitedly

""Just pulled in."" I said with a smile ""I have to go check in. I'll give you a shout in a sec Ash.""

The park office is quite small. Made from logs with nothing but one room with a desk and a computer. You're just meant to check in and move on to your site. An older gentleman was infront of me as I opened the screen door and stepped inside, the smell of pine filling my nose. The lady behind the desk finished with him and moved onto me.

""Good day welcome to wildlands national park. How can I be of assistance today?"" She asked

""I'd like to check in please, I booked  backpacking site number 5 on black lake.""

""Ah welcome Mr. Robert, we have a few disclaimers. As you probably know we got hit by a wisked storm last season and many trees are down. I want to warn you the trail is not easy going and you may have yorubles even if you've been here before.""

""OK."" I said a little more nervous than I had been at at gas station. ""How bad is it?""

""Honestly I'm not sure why they opened the trail. In my opinion we should have had the maintenance crew clear it our before we let campers in this season. No one has bene caught out there but we've had close calls all season.""

""I have a bit of experience, I'm sure if others made it I'll be ok"" I was now scared more for my beloved trip being cut short rather than saftey.

""Well, it's up to you and you're all good to go in, but there will be no ranger patrols Mr Robert. If you need help you'll need to phone the office.""

""All good."" I said as she passed me my paper pass for display on my site. And with that I got back in my car and headed down the road towards the trailhead.

. . .

Authors note:
Did you like the first part? I'd love feedback in the comments or you can message privately if you promise not to be weird.

 I'm getting back into writing and I intend to share my full trip with you lovely people. This is a true story other than names of people and the parkbeing changed. Exact wording of conversations has also been lost to me so that might differ. All other events happened to me on a solo trip into back country Canada. 

Thanks for reading, part 2 coming soon :)

For a good few years now I've been putting money into my help to buy ISA, this was when me and my partner were looking to buy, but we split up last year, I've been continuing to put money into it each month because it's pointless to stop. Few months ago I was made redundant and got some money to top up my savings quite nicely. (my outgoings are low at the moment as well) 

I'm now looking to open my own coffee shop in the new year, I'm wondering if I should just use the help to buy ISA (obviously without the bonus because I'm not buying a house) and my savings to use for setting up the business as I don't know if or when I'll be able to get my own house or how long the business needs to be running for the bank to see I could even afford a mortgage.

1hpqz7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SimonPowellGDM/comments/1hpqz7b/the_hidden_truth_about_dating_apps_thats_keeping/,The Hidden Truth About Dating Apps That‚Äôs Keeping You Single,"Let me hit you with some hard truth: dating apps aren‚Äôt designed to help you find a girlfriend. Nope. They‚Äôre designed to keep you swiping, keep you hooked, and keep you coming back for more. It‚Äôs like a drug dealer saying they‚Äôre just trying to ‚Äúimprove your social life.‚Äù Sure, Jan.

Now, before you jump in the comments to scream, ‚ÄúBut I met my girlfriend on Hinge and we‚Äôre soulmates!‚Äù‚Äîrelax. I‚Äôm not saying dating apps *never* work. I‚Äôm saying that for most people, they end up being a shortcut to frustration, disappointment, and a reason to give up.

And if you‚Äôve been on the apps for a while and haven‚Äôt found what you‚Äôre looking for, it‚Äôs not because you‚Äôre broken. It‚Äôs because the system is. Let me explain.

**1. Dating Apps Turn You Into a Dopamine Junkie**

Here‚Äôs a fun little science lesson: every time you swipe and match, your brain gets a hit of dopamine. It‚Äôs that little ""ooh, I‚Äôm wanted!"" feeling that keeps you coming back. It‚Äôs why you‚Äôll sit there on a Tuesday night swiping through people like you‚Äôre window-shopping for a new blender.

I know this because I did it. A lot. Years ago, I matched with a woman who was basically my dream girl‚Äîsmart, funny, stunning. Let‚Äôs call her Rachel. Things got serious pretty fast, but even while we were dating, I‚Äôd still open Tinder. Not because I wasn‚Äôt happy with her, but because I missed the *rush.* The bad news is that your last date probably did the same thing. You know, sent you that classic ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt feel the spark‚Äù text like clockwork, 24 hours after your first meeting. It‚Äôs not personal‚Äîit‚Äôs a loop. A tired, predictable loop dating app users are all stuck in.

This is the trap. Dating apps condition you to crave the dopamine hit of the match, not the connection. And over time, your brain gets used to the high. Suddenly, a normal, healthy relationship feels... dull. Predictable. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre convinced there‚Äôs something way better out there, just waiting for you.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: the more you chase that high, the less satisfying it gets. You swipe and swipe, and nothing feels good anymore. Congratulations, you‚Äôre now in the same category as slot machine addicts in Vegas.

**2. You‚Äôre Drowning in the Illusion of Choice**

Here‚Äôs another thing dating apps screw up: your sense of what‚Äôs realistic. When you‚Äôve got a hundred profiles in front of you, it‚Äôs easy to start thinking, *‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always someone better out there.‚Äù*

Even when I was dating Rachel, I‚Äôd catch myself wondering, *What if there‚Äôs someone else who‚Äôs even more amazing?* I mean, there are literally thousands of people on these apps. Surely, one of them is my 110% perfect soulmate who also loves cooking pasta and niche ‚Äò90s movies, right?

But here‚Äôs the truth: the more choices you have, the less satisfied you‚Äôll be. This is a psychological concept called the **paradox of choice.** When you‚Äôre overwhelmed with options, you stop appreciating what‚Äôs in front of you because you‚Äôre too busy fantasizing about what‚Äôs *out there.*

The result? You never commit. You never go deep. You end up dating a string of people who are perfectly fine but never quite ‚Äúgood enough.‚Äù And the cruel irony? It‚Äôs not them. It‚Äôs you.

**3. It Messes with Your Self-Worth**

Let‚Äôs talk about validation. Dating apps are like a giant stage where you‚Äôre constantly auditioning for applause. Every match, every message, every ‚ÄúSuper Like‚Äù feels like a little boost to your ego.

But what happens when the matches stop coming? Or when someone ghosts you? Or when you‚Äôre endlessly swiping with no results? Suddenly, it‚Äôs not just rejection‚Äîit‚Äôs a referendum on your entire existence.

I‚Äôve been there. After Rachel and I broke up, I spent months on the apps trying to ‚Äúget back out there.‚Äù And let me tell you, nothing hits harder than watching your matches drop to zero while some dude in a fishing hat gets all the attention.

The truth is, dating apps make you hyper-focused on external validation. They condition you to base your self-worth on how many people swipe right on you. And when you don‚Äôt get that validation, it‚Äôs a downward spiral of self-doubt and insecurity.

**Why Relying on Dating Apps is a Recipe for Disaster**

Look, I‚Äôm not saying you should delete all your dating apps and go live in a cave. Apps can be useful. They‚Äôre a tool, like a hammer or a vibrator‚Äîthey serve a purpose, but they‚Äôre not the whole solution.

The problem is when you make them your *only* way of meeting people. Here‚Äôs why that doesn‚Äôt work:

1. **They encourage surface-level connections.** Swipe culture is all about looks and witty one-liners, not actual compatibility.
2. **They make you passive.** Instead of actively building a life that attracts people, you‚Äôre just waiting for someone to ‚Äúmatch‚Äù with you.
3. **They distract you from real opportunities.** You‚Äôre so busy scrolling that you miss the person sitting next to you at the coffee shop.

**What You Should Be Doing Instead**

If you‚Äôre serious about finding love‚Äîor at least something that lasts longer than three dates‚Äîyou need to take a different approach. Here‚Äôs what worked for me:

1. **Start Living a More Interesting Life:** Go offline. Do things that *actually* make you happy and fulfilled, and you‚Äôll meet people who share your interests in real life.
2. **Focus on Personal Growth:** Hit the gym, read more books, work on your career. The better you feel about yourself, the less you‚Äôll depend on external validation.
3. **Set Boundaries with Apps:** If you use dating apps, treat them as a backup plan or a way to practice your text game, not your main strategy. Spend less time swiping and more time connecting.

**Take Action In Real Life This 2025**

Here‚Äôs the brutal truth: dating apps don‚Äôt fix your loneliness, your insecurities, or your lack of social skills. If anything, they amplify those issues. The more you rely on them, the harder it becomes to form real, meaningful connections. So stop swiping for a minute. Look up. The life you want isn‚Äôt hiding behind a screen‚Äîit‚Äôs out there, waiting for you. But you‚Äôve got to step into the real world to find it. And no, that doesn‚Äôt mean downloading Hinge again.",1,1735576073.0,u_SimonPowellGDM,0,1.0,False

When I was 18, I had a quick and intense change in my habits when I started dating someone who made me aware of how bad processed food was. I didn't think twice and just kinda followed his way of eating. I vividly remember when I started, it was about January, tons of snow on the ground. By the time summer rolled around, we were moving to a different apartment and I remember constantly pulling my pants up while we were painting the house,  and just kinda realizing that, oh damn I lost weight.

I was never fat, but I've always been over weight a little. I'm 5'7 and I was always stuck around 150-160, and at some point when I was kid I think I just started to believe that this was just my weight, and I would never be really 'slim' . 

Well, over the course of that summer, I became someone that I didn't recognize, in the best way possible. 
It was around late July when I invited a friend over that i haven't seen in close to a year. We were gonna have a girls night and just catch up. 
When she got to my house, she was stunned. 

""Whoa!!! Look at you!!""

So, I did. And as I did, I quite literally had a out of body experience.  Somehow, the whole time I lost weight, I never even really stopped and became present and really observed my weight loss.

It's like, in a instant, I looked BETTER than all the girls I was ever envious of. I felt so euphoric in that moment - it was so surreal. 

When I think back on that whole summer , it's like a dream. I was so unbelievably clear headed, that I wasn't focusing on words like calorie or fat or really anything - I was just living. Just being alive that summer felt like a high. 
Is that ketosis? 

The diet we were eating consisted of zero processed food, only ate whole fresh foods. I didn't eat meat at all for maybe 3 months and than ended up just kinda instinctively eating a steak one day after my period lol.  
We also drank coffee but had little to no dairy except for various cheeses. 
Mostly we would just eat rice, veggies, fruits, soups. 
My physical activity didn't change much, if anything maybe i walked a little more. 

By the end of the summer I ended up weighing myself, and to date its the smallest I've been, and I felt soooooooo good. 
I weighed in at 125. It would teter between this and 135 for the next 7 years despite me slipping back slowly into not eating so great. 

Fast forward to present day - I'm a inflamed mess. Starting back from square one without a healthy motivating boyfriend. 
I want to feel good again, I want to feel like I did that summer again, SO BADLY. 

Was this feeling I had from being in ketosis possibly? Because some of the memories I have of the sudden bursts of mental clarity are unreal. It's like I was living at peak level clarity.  

I'm SO determined to get there again.  ",8,1735575633.0,fasting,8,0.91,False
