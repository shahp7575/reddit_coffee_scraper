I am 23 years old and live in Iowa. I am a non-denominational Christian. For most of my life I was a lukewarm Christian, I went to Church with my family but I didn't live a Godly life. A couple months ago I felt the Lord calling on my heart to follow him and he has changed my life. I was baptized in March of 2025, I've felt God change me as a person and I can't wait to see what he has prepared for me!

For a first date I'm good with getting coffee at some point in person. I love studying human biology and learning about how the body functions. It has made me appreciate how incredible life really is. A little bit about me is I love to watch movies, especially oldies. I'm 6'0"" and have a slender frame, I also have brown hair and blue eyes. My favorite film of all time is ""It's a Wonderful Life"", I watch it every year. I go jogging all the time out in the corn fields. Occasionally, I play video games like Minecraft and The Sims. I'd love to have game nights or movie nights, or best of all, both!

When God saved me, I realized my calling was to pursue a career in the medical field. I have given my life to Jesus Christ. I want to get to a point where I read the Bible every day and think about what God wants of me before I act. I'm looking for someone who wants to build a relationship through Jesus. I want someone who loves to spend time in the word. I'm up for someone between the ages of 20 and 26, and I hope to have children one day!

When it comes to a long distance relationship I am up for that but know it may be difficult at times.  I wish I could relocate in the future, however I'm unable to while pursuing my career due to the cost associated and the program is located in my home state. I'm not comfortable dating someone who lives outside of the United States, sorry. Feel free to sent me a message and God bless!",1,1754431770.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

1mimywm,https://i.redd.it/r878oze7y9hf1.jpeg,Oceanos Sank off South Africa," 

On 4 August 1991, the cruise ship Oceanos went down off the coast of South Africa after she took on water during a storm near Coffee Bay. A ventilation pipe burst below the waterline the previous night, flooding the engine room. The crew failed to act or alert the passengers. Power was lost, watertight doors stayed open, and the crew quietly began abandoning ship. No distress call was made. Passengers were left confused and stranded while the bridge was empty. As the list increased, water surged through the ship’s lower decks, forcing many to flee upstairs.

It was cruise entertainers—not the captain—who took control. Guitarist Moss Hills and others radioed for help, organized passengers into groups, and helped launch lifeboats. The South African Air Force and Navy sent helicopters and merchant ships assisted too. Everyone aboard—571 people—was rescued in one of the most remarkable peacetime maritime rescues ever. Oceanos rolled over and sank later that day. Captain Avranas and his officers were later found negligent for abandoning passengers but avoided jail.",2,1754431707.0,Ships,1,1.0,False

(For the purposes of this discussion I’m talking M/F romance.)

For example: I was just reading a book where the sunshine FMC insists on adopting a stray cat (smuggles it into their carriage actually) and the grumpy MMC rolls his eyes and objects, but grudgingly goes along with it because he loves her… and then ultimately falls in love with the cat too. It occurred to me that I’ve never seen that trope in reverse - it’s never the MMC that insists on adopting a stray when it makes literally no sense (you are traveling by carriage for the next week, you really think it’s smart to add a feral cat to this situation??) because he’s just too soft hearted to let it go. I think it would be fully hilarious to read a cinnamon roll or himbo MMC try to smuggle a kitten into a situation while the sensible FMC looks on, appalled.

Another example: awkwardness in MMCs always manifests as aloofness or coldness (think Mr Darcy) and awkwardness in FMCs always manifests in like… zany antics, quirkiness, or clumsiness. There are plenty of snarky FMCs but I’d love to see one who is accidentally cold and aloof because she’s just so awkward around her crush she doesn’t know what to do. And I’d love to read a MMC who is always dropping stuff and spilling coffee on people while trying to start his own cupcake business (or whatever).

1mimwel,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mimwel,AIO: Went on holiday with ex after a great month of getting back together. Found out he was messaging another girl on the plane.,"For context: me (22f) and my ex (23m) were together for ab 2yrs, then broke up for about 8 months then got back together on the 10th of June. 
He was the one who came to me and asked to start over a new leaf as we were pretty toxic before. 
He was speaking to a few girls when we were broken up which is fine he is single I said I don’t care what u do when you are not speaking to me. 
We spoke through a lot of things, I said I will control my emotions and stop over reacting to things and he promised me that he will stop speaking to other girls (as he was before with a girl scribbled out in red in the texts) he booked a spa the day he asked to start back again.
The month from then, everything was great we were both putting in effort (u can see what I’ve done in the screenshots) then we decide to go on holiday together as we’ve always planned to do. 

Before we’re about to take off- I see a girl in his WhatsApp archive. He then proceeds to gaslight me after I asked to see his phone saying that “if I don’t trust him etc this will never work” after me profusely asking and his constant lying and gaslighting he finally tells me he was messaging someone and it’s nothing and it’s a family friend and only one message a day ( the typical textbook lies lol) I then ask to see the messages (took a while again) then I saw he was literally messaging the girl when he went to the toilet whilst we were literally at the gate. 

Keep in mind I was superficially speaking to someone for a few days, and the day my ex wanted to start up again, I told the guy that I was no longer interested and immediately stopped speaking to him as I know it is wrong. 

I was absolutely fuming and cried the whole way to the destination on the plane (if the girl was was seated next to us is reading I’m really sorry for the drama) he was apologising but kept saying “we’re not together” making him seem valid for messaging her EVEN THOUGH we’re on the plane to a holiday. I literally wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. He kept saying he knows he should have stopped messaging her when we got back together but he was “scared that I was going to ruin the relationship again etc” he has been on a date with this girl when we weren’t speaking. 

He says stuff like “I’m not going to stop looking for a potential wife” like okay fine then why are you on holiday with me wtf

I was so hurt because the first week after he broke up with me, he moved on so fast before I could even catch a breath (kissed a girl infront of me at a club and went back to her house whilst he knew I saw everything) as I was mourning our 2 yrs together. Because of this I became addicted to sleeping pills and an alcoholic and I was in the worst mental state of my life for 3-4 months. This is why I was more pissed when he said “I was kind off hoping you found out because I didn’t want to keep messaging her hahah” bare in mind he clearly wasn’t giving her any signals he wanted to end this as the last message from the girl was: “would you like to grab a coffee this week” . So he knew how much this could have potentially affected me and still chose to do it. 

Luckily I am more secure and in more control of my emotions now compared to when we first broke up. So after the plane, he messaged the girl saying he can’t speak to her anymore as he is seeing someone else. And when we got to the hotel I tried to forget everything and enjoy our time as we were already on holiday. If I would have known this before I would have cancelled the trip. I did keep bringing it up in jokes and he did keep apologising. But there was always a hint of defensiveness to his apologies like “we aren’t together” etc.  until I gave up and just protected my peace. The holiday ended up being very fun and I just wanted to continue this and chose to trust him. 

He is now in America doing an elective for his degree. So things are long distance right now.

After that I decided to forgive and forget. And things have been amazing for a few weeks as I’ve decided to just ignore this. 

I hate being those types of “toxic girlfriends” so I have not asked to see his see his phone or text me whenever he’s with ppl etc. I know I’ve chosen to continue this relationship so I don’t want to be controlling and toxic

However argument start with me asking subtle questions about something or someone as I have trust issues now. He then reacts rashly and says i accuse him off stuff with how I tone my questions and my facial expressions and how I can be blunt etc. he then calls me insecure, when I was literally more secure before I got back with him. 

All of this is now making me react in ways that I hate i get overly reactive and start crying and prolonging arguments which is draining for the both of us but I feel like he just doesn’t understand my point. And I am always the problem to him because I can’t control my emotions. 

We’ve been calling and things have been off again with a lot of tension for about a week as I’m “always upset” or always “having a got at him” today he just brought all of that up and I explained how the situation of him messaging the girl has been driving me crazy, he then proceeded to blame me, say it’s not all his fault etc. I then ended the call and the screenshots are from after the call. 

Am I over reacting by thinking his apology isn’t sincere and he’s still insinuating that I am partly to blame? ",2,1754431536.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

1mimuj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Heykens/comments/1mimuj8/i_bought_a_used_hard_drive_opening_that_folder/,I bought a used hard drive… opening that folder was my biggest mistake.”,"The family inside that second-hand hard drive I bought online had no idea they were being watched.

What would you do if you found yourself in possession of an archive containing a stranger's most private moments, secrets, and fears? Would you succumb to your curiosity?

In this story, you will see how innocent curiosity led me into the dark world of a cyberstalker when I cracked the password of an indelible folder.

This is not just a story of surveillance; it is proof of how a digital ghost turns its victims’ lives into a game and how I became the next target of that game. And after this story, you’ll think not twice, but a thousand times before buying a used technological device.

It all started with poverty, a student's greatest enemy. My name is Noah. I'm in my final year of university and am working on tons of video files for my thesis project. When my old laptop's memory became full, my only solution was to buy a cheap, second-hand external hard drive. On an online marketplace, I found an ad for a 2-terabyte disk priced at nearly a third of the market rate. “What a great deal,” I thought. I had no idea how wrong I was.

I bought the drive from a hooded, quiet man whose face I could barely make out at a café in the city center. He didn’t say a word, just took the money and left the drive on the table before walking away. At the time, I didn’t find it odd. After all, that’s how these kinds of sales go.

When I got home and plugged the disk into my computer, the first thing I did was clean it out completely. But one folder... wouldn't delete. Its name: “Family Project.” It also had a lock icon on it. It was encrypted. The curious engineer inside me couldn't ignore this challenge.

After a few hours of effort, I managed to crack the password using a simple coding trick. The password was the word “watch.” The small sense of victory I felt at that moment turned into a cold knot in my stomach. The folder opened. It was filled with hundreds of video files, sorted by date.

I opened the first video. It showed a family watching TV in their living room. A mother, a father, and a young girl. “Probably an art project,” I thought. “Or a social experiment.” I tried to convince myself that there was a logical explanation for it.

I watched a few more videos. But I sensed something was wrong. The camera angles... were strange. One seemed to be shot from inside the smoke detector on the ceiling. Another is from the eyes of the teddy bear in the girl's room.

With horror, I realized that the family had no idea they were being watched. This wasn't an art project. This was a disgusting violation of someone's most private moments, their most intimate spaces.

Just as I was about to remove the disk and take it to the police, my eye caught the file dates. The latest video... was from last night. This wasn't an archive from the past. This was an active, ongoing surveillance. That family could still be being watched right now.

At that moment, fear seeped into my very bones. This was no longer just a pervert's private files. And I was now a witness to this crime.

I couldn't sleep all night. Hoping to find more clues, I started reviewing older videos. And then I noticed the detail that made the situation even more terrifying.

In one video, after the family left the house, I saw a cup on the coffee table slowly sliding. In another video, in the empty children’s room, I watched the closet door open on its own. This “watcher” wasn’t just watching. It was entering the house. It was psychologically manipulating the family with small, unexplainable events.

I had to make a decision. I had to warn the family. To go to the police, I decided to copy the video showing the cup moving the clearest evidence to my desktop.

As soon as the file finished copying, my computer screen suddenly went black.

Beep.

In the center of the screen, a single line appeared in green, retro text:

**“I SAW YOU COPY MY PROJECT. PLEASE DON'T INTERFERE.”**

My breath caught in my throat. There must be some kind of tracking software on the disk. It was monitoring my every move. The moment I removed the disk from the computer, an email notification arrived on my phone.

From: **Unknown**. Subject: **New Project.**

I opened the email with trembling fingers.

There was a single link in the email. Underneath the link was a message:

**“They're starting to get boring. I think I need a new project. Your house and your solitary lifestyle... offer quite interesting potential.”**

In horror, I clicked on the link. On the screen, a live camera feed of that family's house appeared. But the camera was now positioned on a tree across the street, directly facing my window. And in the reflection of that live feed, I was watching my own terrified face. I was no longer a witness. I was the next project.

In panic, my first reaction was to cut all digital connections. I ran to unplug the modem. I turned off the Wi-Fi on my computer and phone. I checked the tape over my laptop’s camera—if it was watching me digitally, I had to blind it. For a moment, in the eerie silence of the room, I felt a sense of relief. The connection was severed. They couldn’t see me anymore.

This feeling ended with a slight electronic buzz that pierced the silence of the room. The sound was coming from the outlet behind my bookshelf. When I pulled the bookshelf forward, what I saw froze my blood. A small, black, unbranded device was plugged into the outlet. A faint, flickering red light was glowing on it. It wasn't just using my internet. It had even set up its own network inside my home. This was a physical violation.

This discovery changed everything. I wasn’t just dealing with a cyberstalker anymore; I was dealing with someone who could come and go as they pleased and set up technological traps. I put the disk and that small device into a bag. I had only one option left: the police.

When I went to the police station, the officer listened to my story with a mocking smile on his face. “So,” he said. “You found secret videos on a hard drive you bought online, and now you think someone hacked you?” His tone implied that I was a delusional person or, worse, an accomplice.

“No,” I said. “He’s a pervert. And he broke into my house.” I placed the hard drive and the small device on the table. “These are the evidence.”

The officer reluctantly took the evidence and said they would send it to the cybercrime unit. For two days, I jumped every time the phone rang, waiting for news. Finally, they called.

The voice on the phone sounded tired and indifferent. “Mr. Noah, your hard drive has been completely wiped. The other device is just a standard Wi-Fi booster. I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do.”

At that moment, I felt as though boiling water had been poured over my head. He had remotely erased all the evidence the moment I went to the police. He had turned me into a paranoid liar. No one would believe me now. I was alone. Completely alone.

I returned to my apartment like a wreck. Running away would have been the easiest thing to do. But then, the face of the little girl on that hard drive came to mind. Anger overpowered my fear. I wouldn’t be a victim. If he was using that technology as a weapon, then I would use the same weapon against him.

I took apart the “standard Wi-Fi booster” the police had given me. While examining the circuit board inside, I noticed something that should never be in a standard device: a hidden data chip and a miniature GSM module. This wasn't a signal booster. It was a sophisticated listening and tracking device connected to its own private network. 

All night long, staying awake with coffee and energy drinks, I tried to establish a reverse connection through that device. Every attempt was blocked by the security walls of the system on the other side. But each time, it left a small trace behind. A fragment of an IP address, a server log... I began piecing these fragments together.

I succeeded in the early hours of the morning. I had broken through the net. Before me was the root directory of the server where all of his “Family Projects” were stored. Dozens of folders. Dozens of families. Dozens of stolen lives.

And most importantly... the geotag data showing the physical location of the server.

He was in a quiet, detached suburban house outside the city.

I sent all the data I had, that single video file, the IP addresses, and the location, to the city's largest newspaper and the Cybercrime Unit via an anonymous email. I added just one sentence at the end of the message: “You think your family is safe. But ‘He’ is watching you.”

Two days later, it was in the news.

It was reported as a breaking news story with the headline “""Hacker House in the Suburbs.""” The police had raided the house following an anonymous tip. Inside, they had apprehended the silent, hooded man who had been spying on dozens of families for years, recording their lives as an “art project,” and playing psychological games with them. The house was like a museum of obsession, filled with hidden cameras, tracking devices, and personal belongings stolen from his victims.

In the news, there were images of one of the rescued families that I had seen on the hard drive. They were hugging each other and crying. They were free.

I deleted the last file on my computer. The hacker had been caught. The nightmare was over.

But sometimes, when I'm working on my laptop at night, that little green webcam light flickers on and off for a moment, and my heart still skips a beat.

Now? I'm staring at job descriptions that make absolutely zero sense. Every single 'entry-level' position I find asks for 3-5 years of experience. Seriously? How am I supposed to get experience if no one will give me a chance to get experience? My resume is polished, I've got a decent GPA, I even did an internship, but it feels like it’s never enough. I've spent so many late nights hunched over my laptop, fueled by lukewarm coffee, customizing cover letters that probably just get filtered out by a bot anyway. The silence from HR departments is deafening. Every 'no calls back' feels like a punch to the gut. It's like I'm stuck in this absurd Catch-22.

#####Chapter 2
&nbsp;
*Location:  Terra Somnium Orbital Elevator, City of Nova Astraeus*

&nbsp;
*Date: 25-08-3288*

&nbsp;
*T-minus 4965:31:11*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
Joseph looked up at the orbital elevator and the launch ramps nearby.  He could see various platforms that all connected to a covered tunnel, knowing that inside of that covered tunnel lay the start of the launch ramp.  It never ceased to amaze him how large the megacity of Nova Astraeus was, a testament to mankind’s desire to explore the unknown.  The orbital elevator known as Terra Somnium, constructed a little more than two centuries prior, had been almost consistently upgraded and improved upon, increasing is overall size time and time again.  These constant upgrades had led to hundreds if not thousands of workers settling around the construct and starting the first signs of Nova Astraeus.  More workers moved in, being required to load and unload the various shipments of incoming and outgoing cargo.  With a steadily increasing population came the need for various stores, ranging from convenience to general to grocery to furniture to clothing.  A mere two hundred years changed what was initially but a small settlement of construction workers into a city of over one point three billion people nestled upon the coast of the Mediterranean Sea of northern Africa.  The sheer size of Nova Astraeus had required a redefining of what exactly constituted a mega city resulting in most being downgraded until only three such cities would remain.

&nbsp;
Those born with silver spoons in their mouths couldn’t possibly understand what it was like to be born on one of the colonies near the main belt or even worse, on of the colonies even further out like on Io or even Titan.  They couldn’t understand what it was like living in situations where you never knew if you would be able to eat the next day or even have oxygen to breath.  Even the medical facilities he had seen since arriving had screamed indulgence.  Here you could see a doctor or even just a medibot even if it was just for a stomach-ache or a case of the sniffles.  Back home though?

&nbsp;
In the distance, shuttles could be seen coming in for landings near the outer platforms while those preparing for departure were routed into tunnels.  From there, they were secured to a launch platform that was connected to one of the dozen mag-rails.  One such platform suddenly shot out from its tunnel, the rails increasing its speed faster and faster along the tracks in a manner similar to a bullet from a railgun.  Once the platform had fully transitioned from a horizontal movement to a vertical one, a task that ended about twenty-five kilometres above the ground, the engines of the shuttle kicked to life.  A few moments later, the clamps connecting the shuttle to the platform released and when the platform came to an abrupt halt thirty-five kilometres above the ground, the shuttle kept the momentum.  This allowed the small passenger shuttle to surge further and further up into the air with less fuel used in the process.

&nbsp;
“A beautiful sight, isn’t it?  Only three places on Earth where you can see something like that.  Going off world on vacation?” the cabby asked, his gaze on the road as he kept an eye on which lane he would need to be in.

&nbsp;
“Something like that.  Figured that I am due for a change of scenery.”

&nbsp;
• • • • • 

&nbsp;
“Bloodhound, heads up!” a Brooklyn accent yelled echoed out.

&nbsp;
Reacting quickly, William ‘Bloodhound’ Owens spun around in the direction of the voice, his hands shooting up just in time to catch the football hurtling through the air toward him.  Frowning as he spun the football in one hand, he shot a glare at the one responsible for the throw.

&nbsp;
“Twitch, this is why we don’t let you carry anything that gets thrown.”

&nbsp;
Tossing the football to another approaching individual, one who was much more imposing, William failed at being able to maintain his frown.

&nbsp;
“He has a point Twitch.  I think the instructors are still pissed at you for what happened during live grenade training,” Samuel ‘Bastion’ Taylor grunted with a southern drawl.  Smirking, he tucked the football into one of his bags.

&nbsp;
“You boys a just jealous that I was their favorite.”

&nbsp;
Shaking his head, William turned back to continue walking down the concourse with his friends.  Spotting the rest of the graduating class in the distance, he lifted a hand only for Cooper ‘Twitch’ Hall to push past him, running forward to jump on the back of a fellow graduate who hadn’t turned around quite fast enough.

&nbsp;
“Have you opened your deployment orders yet?”

&nbsp;
Samuel glanced down at William before nodding his head.  “Looks like they are putting me on the USN The Silver Iris.  Some corvette fresh out of the docks.”

&nbsp;
Taking out his own deployment orders, William glanced over them, a grin spreading across his face.  “Looks like we are stuck together for a while.  That’s the ship I am being posted on as well.”

&nbsp;
“Woo!  USN WINDSHEAR!”

&nbsp;
Several other Ensigns lifted Cooper into the air as they began chanting “Windshear!  Windshear!  Windshear!”, earning more than a few glances from not only other officers but from civilians passing through as well.

&nbsp;
“Oh … darn … Twitch isn’t coming with us …”

&nbsp;
Samuel snorted at the thick layer of sarcastic sass.  “I can hear.  I am really going to miss putting a second lock on the armory doors and triple checking that everything was returned…”

&nbsp;
Gate B12’s seating area began to steadily fill as civilians and officers both filtered in.  Some of the newly graduated officers began to grow excited, recognizing some of the unique uniforms.    Seated at several tables with drinks were members of the Schwarzwald, a USN destroyer that had been commissioned by the Greater European Alliance.  Their gold trimmed uniforms were black with a single vertical red stripe running from each side of the collars of their tunics, down their shoulders and arms, only to be picked up again by their pants and carried to the hems of their pants.  The USN Schwarzwald was a relatively famous ship despite how new it was, having earned its fame during several raids on pirate outposts.

&nbsp;
As handful of freshly graduated officers approached the veteran crew, two more crews began pouring in.  Wearing olive drab uniforms that sported a red ring around the upper left arm, crew members of the Zutibor were excitedly chattering as they approached the gate. This particular ship had been financed and constructed by the North Asian Republic as proof that their economy had finally stabilized.

&nbsp;
“Hey!  Friends look! Fresh meat from academy!” one of the Zutibor crew said in a thick Russian accent, a wide smile spreading across his face.

&nbsp;
Another whose head was shaved smooth but bore a beard that reached the middle of his chest laughed as he clapped his colleague on the shoulder.  “Think any of them are coming to the Zutibor with us?”

&nbsp;
“Maybe … but I think that will depend on if Ivan scares them off,” a third said, watching as the first had run over to one of the academy graduates and hoisted the surprised Ensign over his shoulders.

&nbsp;
The other crew that had arrived alongside those of the Zutibor bore olive green uniforms.  On their shoulders was an insignia of an oriental dragon’s face, its body coiling into a circle behind it while seven plum blossoms surrounded it.  This clearly marked the officers as the crew of the Zhu Que which had been a united effort of the East Asian Kingdoms.

&nbsp;
While the crew of the Zhu Que certainly seemed more disciplined than those of the Zutibor, there was still no hiding some of the curious and even excited side-eyed glances they gave to the academy graduates.  It was a display that slowly fell apart as several crewmates that had been delayed showed up with trays of various snacks and meals.  Upon noticing the small crowd of ensigns at the gate, they grinned and waved to them as best they could without dropping the trays.  Several who were to be assigned to the same ship began approaching the crew, an action which resulted in them being rewarded with some taiyaki, biscuits, or even a corn dog.

&nbsp;
“Hey, I think I am gonna go grab something to munch on,” William said while giving Samuel a nudge with his elbow.  “You want anything while I am looking?”

&nbsp;
“That’d be great.  Can you grab me some linguine and nachos?”

&nbsp;
“Y-yeah …”  It took a deal of effort for William not to dwell on just what Samuel was going to do with the two dishes.  “Grab us some seats.  I will be back in a few.”

&nbsp;
Jogging toward the food court, he could already se the variety of choices available.  Italian, American, Mexican, Chinese, and plenty others.  A myriad of tantalizing aroma’s filled the air accompanied by the sound of sizzling foods.  Spotting a place called Frankie’s Dogs N’ Hogs, William could already feel just how much training he would need to do over the next few days, the though barely enough to keep him from laughing at the name.

&nbsp;
“Sure… why not?  Once we launch, it isn’t like there will be anything other than cafeteria food.”

&nbsp;
Making his way up to the counter, he looked over the options.  He could tell it was American food as the hot dog section had nearly a dozen different options alone.  While the pulled pork options certainly were tempting, William couldn’t help but notice the various ‘corn dog’ options.

&nbsp;
“Yeah … could I get two herb and cheddar sausage corn dogs?  Oh, also four bottles of water.”

&nbsp;
Taking his ticket, William proceeded to several more shops placing orders for some curry bread, some linguine with lemon garlic sauce, and an order of nachos.  Jogging back to Frankie’s as he heard his number called, it wasn’t long before he was juggling several to-go bags.  Noticing the time displayed on a nearby clock, William began to head back to the gate, his shoulder accidentally bumping into that of another young man not too much older than himself.

&nbsp;
Joseph swore under his breath as a small collision caused some of his coffee to splash across his shirt.  Using some paper serviettes, he quickly dabbed up the spill to minimize any chance of it staining.  Glancing at the military man who seemed to be in a hurry, Joseph couldn’t help but shake his head.  A quick glance at his boarding pass directed him toward Gate B12.

&nbsp;
He could hear the dull clamor of numerous voices before he even saw the gate.  A small smirk tugged at the corner of his mouth as he couldn’t help contemplating the irony of being on a shuttle full of what appeared to be officers and soldiers.  Glancing out of one of the windows, he watched as the connection bridge extended and connected to the Fata Luce.  The vessel was massive, semi-transparent sides allowing for passengers to see outside without having to peer through small windows.

&nbsp;
Hearing the announcement for boarding, Joseph began making his way toward the connection bridge that led to the second floor of the spacecraft.  Out of the corner of his eyes, he couldn’t help but notice a soldier who had cut up pasta and was now using it as a topping for nacho’s.  Unable to prevent his jaw from clenching, Joseph wondered if he had some Italian heritage in his ancestry.

&nbsp;
“Just ignore it … it isn’t my place,” he muttered while shaking his head.

&nbsp;
Handing over his new passport and ticket, he smiled to the gate agent.

&nbsp;
“Everything is all ready for you Mr. Mason.  We hope you have a pleasant flight,” the Irish woman says with a beaming smile as she passes back the passport of Erwin Mason.

&nbsp;
Giving a not of his head, Joseph put away the passport before making his way up into the connection bridge.  It would be nice to get back into space.  As interesting as it was to be planet side, it just wasn’t home.  Sure, it was beautiful in its own right, but it wasn’t the colonies.  It wasn’t out among the stars… and he was starting to miss what he had grown up familiar with.  The low hum of gravity engines, the soft whirring of atmospheric generators, even the black void of the sky outside of the domes.  Some people might feel unnerved or even paranoid, but to him, they all whispered a beautiful song that everything was working properly.

&nbsp;
Looking at his ticket, he smiled as he continued to walk up the bridge leading to the second floor.  Making his way down the corridor, he arrived at a small room with the number 218 emblazoned on the door’s window.  Opening it, he smiled as he looked at a pair of couches that could easily pass for beds if necessary.  Walking over to one, he placed his luggage in an overhead container.

&nbsp;
Staring out the wall sized window, he watched as the connection bridge to a smaller starship pulled away.  Once it was clear, the platform that the ship lay upon began to slide away toward the launch tunnel, carried by a powerful magnetic rail system.  A smile tugged at the corners of his mouth.  It wouldn’t be long now, perhaps just a half hour at most.  Hearing the door to the cabin open, he barely even glanced to who was entering.  He could already hear a pair of male voices chatting away.

&nbsp;
A peek out of the corner of his right eye caused the muscles in his eyelid to start twitching, a tick that he often got when something annoyed him.  This time, it was that right across from him sad two young men, perhaps just entering their twenties.  One had short, messy, and untidy brown hair, the color close to being dark enough that it could be considered black.  The other, was a redhead with just a hint of blonde thrown in.

&nbsp;
While Joseph could care less about the hair colors of the two, what had caused that tick in his eyelid was that after sitting down, the redhead decided to take out a marker and start drawing what looked to be a lightning bolt or a z on the first man’s forehead.  It was going to be a long trip… Then he noticed the box of beanboozled jelly beans and he barely managed to stifle a groan or some other slew of profanity… maybe both.  Fourteen movies.  Fourteen movies with each having two or three remasters.  He couldn’t remember when the first movie had been made but apparently even after all those years, people were still obsessed with that series to the point of dressing up as some of the characters.  A slight smile tugged at the corner of his mouth again.  At least it didn’t have sparkly vampires.

&nbsp;
Putting in some earbuds, Joseph tapped a finger on his wristwatch to pull up a holographic keyboard.  Typing into it, he settled back into the couch he was sitting on and stared out the semi-transparent wall.  A slight smile began to tug at the corner of his lips as one of his favorite classics began to play over his earbuds.  Movement out of the corner of his eyes caught his eyes as the connection bridges began to separate.

&nbsp;
A chuckle escaped him as he thought back to his childhood and the history classes he had to take.  Technology sure had improved over the centuries.  Boarding a shuttle let alone a standard atmospheric transport was so much quicker these days.  Supposedly back in the twentieth century boarding could take up to an hour.  Now it took barely a half hour and that was assuming there was some sort of trouble with a passenger.  Even assuming that one could enter the connection bridge without a legitimate ticket, cabins couldn’t be accessed by anybody without the correct ticket.

&nbsp;
A heavy thud could be felt through the Fata Luce as the platform it was on began to detach and move toward the launch tube.  Joseph had to admit, it was far smoother than the coarse, grinding, and rickety sensation of an outer colony launch platform.  If he closed his eyes, he could almost imagine that nothing was moving at all… which made it feel all the more unnatural to him.

&nbsp;
“Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your Captain Hector Di Cello speaking.  We aboard the Fata Luce appreciate your business.  Please take this time to fasten your seatbelts or adjust your cabin's gravity generators.  Kūko station reports that there is light turbulence to be expected.  Our total travel time to docking port Zheng is estimated to be thirty minutes.  Once there, we will remain docked for forty minutes before continuing on to Nova Luna.”

&nbsp;
*There’s something in the air*

&nbsp;
*Burning ions in the oxygen are all aglow*

&nbsp;
*A feeling everywhere*

&nbsp;
*Premonitions of the storm that comes*

&nbsp;
*But I won’t go*

&nbsp;
A nearly inaudible hiss and clunk announced that the platform had transitioned fully onto the launch rails.  Taking the seatbelt, Joseph buckled himself in even as his cabinmates quickly began adjusting the gravity controls.  Perhaps it was just him, but a launch never quite felt real without the seatbelts and g-forces that pressed him into his seat.  If the two young men were going to deny him gravity, he would be damned if he wouldn’t at least enjoy the seatbelt tightening against him.

&nbsp;
“Bloody hell Harold … you can’t even see the end of the rails from down here.”

&nbsp;
“I’ve got to get a picture of this.  Ronnie, pose like you are Atlas holding the tower on your shoulders!”  Harold said with a grin, typing a set of commands into a bracer.  No sooner had he finished typing than a drone detached from his backpack and began to move between the two.  “Mom and Dad are going to love this.”

&nbsp;
*I’m done running towards*

&nbsp;
*The eyes of tornadoes*

&nbsp;
*Pretending this is home*

&nbsp;
Seeing the lights near the tunnel begin to light up, their yellow glow announcing to the shuttle pilot, Joseph took a deep breath before exhaling.  Spotting flashing red and blue lights in the distance, a small smirk pulled at Joseph’s lips as he noticed that they were beginning to turn off toward the port.  Too late to catch him… if that was what they were coming for.  He was home free.  The best they would be able to do is contact Station Kūko and hope that they would catch him in time.

&nbsp;
As the final light lit up and they all turned green, the platform shot forward as if propelled from a cannon.  Following the rails, the platform and the Fata Luce entered the launch tunnel, their speed rapidly increasing.  One hundred.  Three hundred.  Six hundred.  A thousand kilometres an hour.  Faster and faster the platform sped up, each ring it passed increasing the speed further.

&nbsp;
*I breathe in the atmosphere*

&nbsp;
*Let it wash over my fear*

&nbsp;
*Of these heights as I transcend*

&nbsp;
*And become whole again*

&nbsp;
As the Fata Luce continued shooting skyward, surpassing Mach 10, the starship’s engine flared to life.  As the magnetic clamps released the landing legs, the platform began to slow as the Fata Luce surged forward, peeling away from the central column of the space elevator.  Flaring ever brighter, Joseph watched the sky outside as their speed increased further and further.  Closing his eyes, he finally allowed a relaxed and satisfied smile to spread across his lips.

&nbsp;
Nearly a dozen military and law enforcement vehicles were arriving at the port when an explosion tore through one of the launch tunnels.  The flames hadn’t even fully explained when a second, third, fourth, and fifth explosion tore through the numerous buildings attached to Terra Somnium.

&nbsp;
• • • • • 

&nbsp;
William grinned as he and his cabinmates all gripped their seatbelts.  They could feel each rumble, each shake, and each increasing burst of speed of the Fata Luce.  Sure, they could have adjusted their room’s gravity controls, but they were all going to be serving aboard military starships.  They would eventually need to get used to this.  There was no telling when they would need to enter a planet’s gravity well or feel an impact against the hull of their ship.  Adjusting the gravity was great for leisure or comfort, but when it came to needing to be constantly aware of the vessel you serve upon and the situation it is in, an adjusted gravity could spell disaster.

&nbsp;
The corners of his eyes caught a flicker of light from toward the surface, but it wasn’t until he heard one of his fellow graduates swore that he began paying attention and stopped staring out into the distance.  Glancing to the ensign who swore, he took notice of the look of horror on their face.  Following their gaze, he could barely make out the billows of smoke that were fading into the distance.

&nbsp;
Clenching his teeth tight, he can feel his face pale a little.  Squeezing his eyes shut, he draws a deep breath in before exhaling.  Had they been on any later of a flight, it could have been them in one of those locations.  Turning his gaze away from the ground, he watched as the blue of the sky began to slowly bleed away, shrinking and fading.

&nbsp;
The ascent of the Fata Luce was exciting for the numerous graduates.  While some including William simply enjoyed the sight, savouring every moment of the until now uncommon sight.  Others began to take notes on data-pads or review files, while many of the rest began to talk among themselves or shut their eyes in a desperate attempt to either stave off nausea or catch just a little bit of sleep.

&nbsp;
Watching as the sky finally turned into that thin blue line, William didn’t realize that he was holding his breath as that thin line vanished and all that was left was the black of space above and the faint blue glow of the Earth’s atmosphere below.  Sadly though, the thirty-minute voyage seemed to be all too short.

&nbsp;
It wasn’t long before the grasp of the Earth’s gravity began to feel as if it were slowly but steadily releasing its grasp on those breaking free of the atmosphere.  The feel of weightlessness was awkward at the start.  Thinking hard, he finally decided what it felt like.  He remembered how carnival drop towers felt.  It was similar to that, but slow and without the feel of the breeze rushing past. Gulping, he began to focus, supressing his body’s reaction to the sensation.  Turning his gaze to the right, the direction of the front of the Fata Luce, his jaw began to drop before slowly spreading into a wide grin.

&nbsp;
The ring station Kūko was an impressive work to say the least.  Stretching out to encircle the Earth along the equator, the station had taken years to construct and to this day had to be consistently worked on to maintain it.  Approximately one thousand six hundred feet wide and six hundred and fifty feet tall, Kūko was practically an orbital megacity on its own.  Fortunately, most of it was empty transportation tubes with the population clusters focused around the large docking arrays. 

&nbsp;
Slowly the Fata Luce began to arch, its underbelly pointing away from the Earth’s surface.  Like a whale breaching the ocean, the nose of the transport lazily swung back, leveling out before the vessel began to align with one of the many elongated docking arms that was the entrance to the docking port Zheng.  Reverse thrusters began to fire, slowing the Fata Luce rapidly from thousands of kilometres per hour down to hundreds, then dozens.  Gliding between the two prong-like arms, the large shuttle slowed to a crawl before finally coming to a rest as the arms attached to the ship, connecting several bridges.

&nbsp;
• • • • • 

&nbsp;
Aboard the Kūko, the dozens of graduates began bidding farewells to one another, friends that had worked alongside one another for years in an effort to reach this point embraced each other tightly, wanting this moment to last for as long as they could make it.  William and Samuel began to travel down the corridors with a half dozen other recruits, making their way toward gate V17.  Passing by a glass wall as they grew closer to their destination, a couple swore softly under their breath.

&nbsp;
“Hooooly ffff,” Samuel began as he stared out at the vessel they were approaching.  “Will you look at the size of that thing …”

&nbsp;
Another graduate jogged over to the window, pressing his hands up against it.  “Beautiful …  The Warden-class heavy frigate.  Four hundred sixty-eight-meter length, a mass of nine hundred and fifty thousand tons, a maximum speed of six thousand seven hundred and fifty-four kilometers per second...""

&nbsp;
“Christ Widget, you sound like you want to marry it,” a female graduate said with a laugh.

&nbsp;
“Can you blame me?  Look at the guns on it.  Four twin-barrel nine-hundred-millimeter Hail-storm cannons, sixteen single-barrel five-hundred-millimeter cannons, ninety-four anti-strike craft quad cannons and nearly double that in Phalanx Three point-defence turrets…” Widget all but giggled.  “I can’t wait to get aboard and get a look at the engines and the reactor.”

&nbsp;
“Just … don’t tinker with anything … remember what happened when you decided to mess with that armored car.  Still can’t believe that they didn’t kick you out…”

&nbsp;
Continuing down the corridor, the graduates slowed to a stop seeing two platoons of what appeared to be crew and soldiers standing at attention.  In front of them seemed to be a high-ranking soldier posted to the ship that they were to board.

&nbsp;
“Graduates!  Fall in!” the Colonel roared out, encouraging the graduates to hastily fall in line with the other crew members.  “As of this moment, you are all the crew of The Silver Iris!  You will eat!  Sleep!  Breathe!  Sweet! And bleed on board this ship for the next four years of your life!  Those next to you are your brothers!  Your sisters!  You WILL work together or, God as my witness, I will personally toss you into a suit and drag your ass behind the Iris!”

&nbsp;
“You will care for the Iris like she is family, like she is your lover!  You WILL NOT let harm come to her because of negligence!  As long as you protect the Iris, she will protect you!  Once we board the Iris, you will check your data-pads for your quarters.  You will proceed there IMMEDIATELY and get yourselves unpacked POST HASTE!  DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?!”

&nbsp;
“Sir, yes sir!”  the graduates shouted back, some surprised that the others also yelled back the response.

&nbsp;
“Once you are unpacked, you will get instructions on where you are being posted.  You will proceed to your new posts and follow further instructions once there!” the Colonel barked out in a commanding tone.  A hiss of the airlock behind him opening could be heard.

&nbsp;
“At ease Colonel.  We don’t want to scare our new blood too much on their first day,” stated a warm but firm voice as an officer pulled himself through the airlock, not missing a single step as the station’s gravity suddenly took over and pulled him toward the floor.  “Graduates, today marks the beginning of a new chapter in your lives.  As the crew and ground forces of The Silver Iris and as members of the Sol Fleet, it is our duty to protect Earth, Mars, Luna, and all associated colonies near and far from threats both external and from within.  Let me make this clear.  While we are not at war, that does not mean that these are peaceful times.  You will be asked to make harsh decisions in the future that may conflict with your own ideals.  I can only hope that every decision made by yourselves and myself will be for the greater good of all lives within Sol.  I am Commander Sigmund Herrmann, Captain of The Silver Iris.  I have no doubt that some of you would better recognize me as 'Kriegshammer' Herrmann.  I cannot promise not to put you all into danger, but I can promise that any who threaten The Silver Iris, her crew, and her marines will pay a toll in blood.  Once you are all aboard, we will depart the Kūko.  You will have two days to settle in and get familiar with the ship and those you will be serving alongside.  After, we will relieve the USN Weser’s Ferryman.”

&nbsp;
Smiling, Commander Sigmund gave the gathered graduates, crewmen and marines both, a salute.  “At ease and welcome aboard USN The Silver Iris.  Colonel Sanders, get everybody on board within the hour.”  Turning back to the airlock, he strode back into it before kicking off a little and letting the nearly nonexistent gravity to begin carrying him further into his ship.

I’ve been seeing LeanBiome ads everywhere lately and decided to give it a try. For context, I’m a 35‑year‑old office worker who stays reasonably active (mostly walking and yoga) but struggles with stubborn weight around my midsection and constant snacking. I’ve experimented with various supplements—some worked, most didn’t. Here’s what I found after a month on LeanBiome.



\*\*What it is:\*\* LeanBiome is a probiotic-based weight loss supplement that targets the gut microbiome. The creators say it’s backed by Ivy League research and that correcting gut bacteria can reduce cravings and increase metabolism. It uses a blend of “lean bacteria” strains plus natural extracts like green tea and konjac root.



\*\*Week 1:\*\* I noticed I didn’t feel as hungry between meals. Usually I’d reach for chips or sweets, but I just didn’t have the same urge. No stomach discomfort, which was my big concern with any probiotic.



\*\*Week 2:\*\* Energy levels felt steadier. I stopped relying on coffee in the afternoon. My digestive system also seemed happier (less bloating).



\*\*Week 3‑4:\*\* By the end of the month I’d lost about 5 lbs. That might not sound huge, but it was without extreme dieting. My clothes felt looser and the scale was finally moving. Cravings stayed low and I found it easier to say no to second helpings.



\*\*Pros:\*\*



\- Appetite control – I actually felt full with smaller meals.

\- No jitters or crash (no stimulant overload).

\- Simple once‑daily capsule, easy to incorporate.

\- Backed by research and includes probiotics, not just stimulants.



\*\*Cons:\*\*



\- It’s not cheap—quality probiotics rarely are.

\- Results aren’t overnight; you need to stick with it for a few weeks.

\- You still need to move your body and eat sensibly for best results.



Overall, LeanBiome has been the most “worth it” supplement I’ve tried in a while. I’m going to continue taking it because I like how it makes me feel (less hungry, more energetic) and the weight loss is a nice bonus. If you’re curious to learn more, I wrote a longer review here with more details and where to find it:

1mimm1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpTariffNews/comments/1mimm1l/end_of_de_minimis_alarms_ecommerce_sellers/,"End of De Minimis Alarms E-Commerce Sellers, Consumers","(WSJ) -- The looming end of a tariff exemption for low-cost goods is distressing e-commerce merchants and U.S. shoppers who fear prices will rise.

The White House last week said it was suspending the de minimis provision, which allows shipments worth $800 or less to enter the U.S. tariff-free, as of Aug. 29. This is much sooner than a July 2027 deadline mentioned in President Trump’s recent budget bill.

“Nobody wanted to deal with this,” said Hugo Pakula, chief executive of Tru Identity, an artificial-intelligence platform for global trade. “They were happy to push off the problem for two years.” 

Businesses that depend on low trade barriers will have to pay tariffs that could range from 10% to as much as 50%, depending on the country of origin and the product. Some U.S. consumers say they are worried those higher costs will lead to price hikes, as they have at brick-and-mortar retailers such as Walmart and Best Buy. Big online marketplaces such as Etsy that host small businesses may also suffer from lower sales.

The Trump administration on May 2 ended de minimis for lower-cost goods from China and Hong Kong, hitting big e-commerce companies such as Temu and Shein. The White House says closing what it calls a tariff loophole will help U.S. manufacturers and workers.

Etsy, which caters to many sellers who rely on de minimis, could be one of the biggest corporate losers as the exemption ends worldwide. Shares of the Brooklyn, N.Y.-based company have fallen more than 6% since Trump signed the executive order to end it.

“The spirit of the de minimis exemption is to help exactly Etsy sellers and people like Etsy sellers,” CEO Josh Silverman said at an investor conference in May.

At that same conference, the company’s chief financial officer said 25% of Etsy’s gross merchandise sales come from people in the U.S. buying from merchants abroad, and sellers in the U.S. shipping abroad. 

Etsy didn’t respond to requests for comment after the latest announcement. It posted a guide on its website saying the de minimis change will significantly affect how its sellers serve U.S. buyers. Merchants will have to clarify a product’s country of origin and inform buyers whether orders may be subject to tariffs.

“E-sellers are really in a panic. It’s not just the tariffs, it’s also ancillary costs of trade compliance,” said Marianne Rowden, CEO of the E-Merchants Trade Council. Thin profit margins mean hiring customs brokers and paying customs bonds could drive some out of business, she said.

Oak and Willow, a Canadian cleaning-products company that had relied on de minimis, said the end of the provision on Aug. 29 would be life-altering for small businesses. The company said half its customer base is in the U.S. and that it can’t afford to absorb the tariffs. 

“I’m really terrified because the fall and winter are our busiest season and we rely on that income all year long,” said Haley Massicotte, owner of Oak and Willow, in an Instagram post over the weekend.

Some U.S. shoppers who buy anime figurines, roasted coffee beans and all sorts of other products from foreign retailers say they are stocking up ahead of feared price increases. Devotees of fountain pens, for instance, say the best ones come from Europe and Japan, and that they also like inks from Korea. 

“This isn’t Temu. These are high-end pens and no one else makes nibs like that,” said Jessica Minier, a hobbyist from St. Louis, Mo., who likes Sailor pens from Japan. 

Minier said she rushed to buy three fountain pens totaling $400 from Japan immediately after the White House announced the impending end of de minimis. “That’s a lot of money and I could normally spread the purchases out. This may be it for a while.” ",3,1754430854.0,TrumpTariffNews,0,1.0,False

This is different from our experience with the hotel.  

Our experience is as follows:
We stayed at Hotel Beauregard for 2 nights.  Arriving after 10p the first night we found the reception closed.  The following morning, breakfast was just done being served at 0930am and staff had politely offered up a plate of four croissants, some fruit and coffee.  We were grateful to have some nourishment but they did not indicate a charge of 60fr ($105Cdn) would be placed on our account which was a surprise upon checkout but we did pay.  On our day at the hotel we enjoyed the pool (as we intended to do) after a walk into town.  At approximately 5pm myself and my two children were sitting on the steps in the pool where metal grates emit bubbles at varying intensities.  My wife was on the deck and taking a picture of us.  We suddenly felt an intense electrical jolt throwing us from our seated position (i'm sure you have video footage) but we did not immediately know what occurred.  We did discuss it with patrons in the pool but this was lost in translation.  We exited the pool and recovered in patio loungers, discussing what had occurred when a man, also a patron was yelling at a staff member.  After their altercation, I asked the man what they were discussing.  He indicated the exact same sensation occurred to him just hours before.  When this occurred to him, the manager did not close the pool to patrons.  He now demanded they close it as it kept occurring and now kids were affected and this was obviously an acute risk of electrocution.  My 9 year old son had shoulder pain for 3 hours following the incident requiring analgesics.  We did not re-enter the pool at anytime after this incident as we were very shaken from the experience.  The following day, I discussed the matter with management who were apologetic and indicated the issue was looked into, identified, and repaired.  When I enquired further regarding what the issue was; they did not know what was repaired but that it was now safe.  We were not satisfied with this response.  Our experience at Hotel Bearegard was poor.  The way this was handled by management was also poor.  This is a beautiful, premium property with premium charges but the experience was sub optimal to say the least. 

We paid our bill upon check out in good faith that you will do the right thing now.
I would be satisfied with a partial refund of the charges in the amount of one nights accommodation and the breakfast charges because we were unable to enjoy the safe use of your facilities to the full extent of our expectations.  We hope your facility remains safe for others to enjoy in the future.

With respect,

For context, I am an EU citizen (dual citizen with another country, although that dosen't really matter) and I recently finished my undergrad in the US with a degree in international relations. I was on a Visa in the US, and the situation here really is untenable, so I am focusing on applying for Jobs in Europe. I can work in the EU without a visa, but for various reasons, I would prefer to work in the UK,  (English is the language I have the greatest level of fluency in, and I want to do a masters in the UK in about 2 or 3 years, so I would like to already be there). 



I know that the language of the skilled worker visa says that you need an employer to sponsor you if you plan to work in the UK for longer than 6 months.  Does that mean that you can work for less than 6 months without a sponsor? I presume the answer is no, but I can't find something concrete online. I have an aunt who lives in London, plus some friends there as well, so if it were allowed, I would move there, work minumum wage for a month or two while applying for jobs that can provide sponsorship. I have to leave the US in less than a month and I'm trying to decide my options for where to go next. If I don't get a job offer in the next couple of weeks, I would have to move somewhere and start working something tempoary (coffee shop type jobs) before getting a job in my area, and I would rather do it in the UK rather than somewhere else in the EU, so I wanted to check whether that would be a possible option. I know finding jobs willing to provide sponsorship is difficult in itself, but I think it would be easier to do from the UK rather than virtually. ",1,1754430785.0,ukvisa,0,1.0,False
1mimkjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1mimkjr/why_does_my_ex_still_contact_me/,why does my ex still contact me?,"My boyfriend broke up with me in the beginning of July. 

I was absolutely torn and i tried everything to fix whatever it was that made him want to break up with me. 

I was so desperate I FaceTimed him crying and he felt so bad for me he invited me over but even when I would go over to his place he would just tell me that he didn’t see me as his long-term partner and that he likes me as a person, but he just doesn’t see this relationship going well in the long run.  

we would go no contact for a few days and I would just be really heartbroken each day, but he would reach out saying he was “just checking in” on me and anytime he did I get this hope and would think this is my chance to show him I still care and I’m willing to work on things. I think the first time he texted me that he was just checking in I just exploded to him and told him that I really missed him and that I really wanted us to be together and that I would do whatever it takes if they meant that we could still be together.

but he would just time and time again tell me that he has fun with me and likes me but he just cant be in a relationship. he told me he won’t block my phone number because he still cares about me and he wants me to reach out to him if I need anybody to talk to.

Even a few days after this conversation, at like one or 2 AM or whatever random hour in the night, he would send me these massive paragraphs telling me that this decision was really hard for him and that he wants me to know that he still cares about me and that he’s always there if I need him. but he never talks about getting back together, he’ll always end it with “I hope you find someone that loves you for who you are that person is not me”

but I’m like why do you keep reaching out with this lengthy paragraphs telling me all this stuff that u still care but you’re not committed enough to be in a relationship with me still? and its always repeating these same things, long term, i care about you, blah blah. 

at this point, it’s been about three weeks since he’s broken up with me and we’ve hung out maybe twice. Once was because I needed clarification on something and we ended up FaceTiming and he asked me to come over and we ended up hooking up. The second time was the next day when for some reason, I asked him to get coffee and immediately regretted it because I’m like why am I begging this person to be with me still? he told me that he would love to hang out, but then included that he would like me to return his contacts from my place. So you didn’t really wanna hang out you just wanted your stuff back. when I got coffee with him, I was so over it. I just handed him his stuff and he handed me all of my stuff that was bagged up and I just gave him a half assed hug and said bye without barely making eye contact with him and I just left. 

Following that interaction, he sent me massive paragraphs at 3 AM saying that he was sorry for all those times he said all these hurtful things to me and that he never meant it and that he doesn’t want me to think less of myself because of anything he said and that he’s proud to have dated me. 

and at this point, I’m just kind of like dude whatever. If it makes you feel better to send me these emotional paragraphs when you’re having late night depression thoughts go for it. I haven’t responded since. 

but deep down, I do still really want to be with him. I just can’t believe he would throw away all those things we said to each other and everything we have over nothing. Part of me has a hope that will get back together, but he even told me that he doesn’t want me to have that hope and that he would encourage me to move on, and that he thinks in a few years maybe he’ll move on too. 

but I’m just confused as to why he keeps sending me these long paragraphs like is there a possibility that we could still get back together?

I’m currently staying at a well-rated 4-star hotel in Copenhagen with my family, and the experience has been pretty frustrating. I wanted to share what’s been happening and get your thoughts—am I expecting too much, or is this truly below standard?

Here’s a summary of what we’ve faced so far:

•	First night (03.08.2025): We arrived late at night, only to find our room had a broken toilet lid and a completely clogged shower drain. Water wouldn’t drain at all. For a hotel in this price range, that felt unacceptable. Reporting it to the reception was the only thing we could do—no immediate compensation or real apology.

•	Next day (04.08.2025): They moved us to another room of the same category. No upgrade, no proper apology. I had to spend over an hour moving all our unpacked luggage myself with just a trolley—no staff offered to assist. Later, we noticed the sink in the new room was clogged too. Maintenance only came to fix it after we reported it again that day.

•	Today (05.08.2025): Housekeeping left the bathroom unclean (toilet stains untouched) and didn’t restock basic things like tea and coffee. 
This is probably another story but, worth to note: the house keeping is not coming to you by default, you need to scan a QR code and fill a damn google form every day so that they’d come in. The room doesn’t have a phone to contact reception, so I had to go down to the lobby at midnight just to request a tea bag. Earlier, I had asked for a direct phone number to call in case of problems, but they just gave me the same number listed on Google Maps—which they admitted is rarely answered.

The hotel only offered us a complimentary dinner for these ongoing issues, which feels like a joke given how much time and energy this is costing during what’s supposed to be a once-a-year family vacation.

Am I overreacting, or is this level of service unacceptable for Copenhagen hotels in this range? Would love to hear your opinions—especially from locals or frequent travelers here.

Thanks in advance!

I just walked across the stage, diploma in hand, feeling on top of the world for about five minutes. Then reality hit me like a ton of bricks. I chose to focus on the 'Uncertain and Competitive Job Market' because holy cow, it’s a beast. Every 'entry-level' job seems to require five years of experience, and then there's the constant chatter about AI replacing roles I *just* studied for. I've been staying up way too late rewriting cover letters, second-guessing every bullet point on my resume, and just staring at my screen, wondering if I'm even applying for the *right* kind of jobs. The thought of this taking 4-6 months, or even longer, honestly makes my stomach twist. I spilled coffee all over my desk this morning just thinking about another round of generic rejection emails.

In a moment of pure desperation, after scrolling through endless 'day in the life of' TikToks that just made me feel worse, I stumbled across Gradxiety.com. I figured, what's one more click? I checked out some of their free resources, specifically a section on navigating long job searches and tailoring applications in a competitive market. It wasn't a magic wand, but seeing some structured advice on how to break down the search, identify transferable skills, and even just manage expectations, actually made me feel a little less overwhelmed. I used their template to finally map out a real networking plan instead of just blindly firing off applications, and I actually felt calmer drafting my *next* resume, focusing on impact instead of just listing duties.

It’s still early days, and the anxiety is definitely still there, but that small win gave me a glimmer of hope. Has anyone else found a good hack or specific strategy for dealing with this super long, often silent, job search? Or any tips for making your applications stand out when it feels like you're up against an army of bots and seasoned pros? Share your wisdom, please!",1,1754430664.0,Gradxiety,0,1.0,False
1mimiul,https://www.reddit.com/r/airforceots/comments/1mimiul/i_completed_otsa_this_summer_here_is_what_i_wish/,I completed OTS-A this summer. Here is what I wish I knew,"1. Bring safety pins. They help keep your hospital corners down.
2. Bring your own blanket or sleeping bag so you can sleep on top of the blue comforter. The tan blanket they issue doesn't seem very comfortable or warm to me, though I never used it. I used my own sleeping bag. I thought the pillows they issued were fine.
3. The blue comforter that they issue you is too short to make nice-looking hospital corners. You will likely get the turquoise blue colored one; I recommend going back into the linen closet later that night, after getting your comforter distributed and finding a navy blue one. They are much larger and softer, and you will have an easier time making hospital corners with them.
4. Bring a tape measure. It will help with getting your uniform set up and your dorm inspection ready.
5. Put sunscreen on before you enter the OTS campus on day 1 and eat a full meal. You'll be getting yelled at too much to find the time to put it on throughout the first day. Lunch also isn't until 1pm if I recall.
6. A mesh laundry bag is nice because you can toss the whole thing in there without your underwear and socks getting mixed up with your roommates'. You WILL be doing laundry with your roommates because there are not enough machines for everyone to do laundry individually. The OTS shopette only carries fabric laundry bags
7. You have access to coffee in the DFAC in the first week, but it can run out sometimes.
8. Know how to be in the position of attention and at ease/parade rest and your seven basic responses. As a non-prior, it was scary that first day, not knowing how to stand or speak.
9. Bring a small portable fan! Please! The dorms regularly lose AC, and the flight rooms are uncomfortably warm. You won't need the fan for your mock deployment through; the tents are cold.
10. Memorize your OTS Special instructions (SPINS), the Airmen's Creed, the Air Force song, and the Space Force song. I mean, you'll be fine too if you don't memorize them, but you'll be a lot less stressed if you're already familiar with them coming into the first few days. The first few days of OTS are the absolute worst, so try to do everything you can to make them easier.
11. Print out multiple copies of the SPINs and the dorm SOP once you get ahold of them. That way, you can read them throughout the day. You'll lose or rip copies. Your friend will, too.
12. Wait to buy or wash your blue uniform until you get there. It's so worth it! It saves the headache of transporting your blues and keeping them inspection-ready because they'll be out of the closet for the first month of OTS.
13. You'll want lint rollers for keeping the carpet and floor clean—the public vacuums in the dorms SUCK. Lots of OTS graduates toss their stuff in the supply closets in the dorm the morning they leave, so you might be able to salvage lint rollers in there. The same goes for the plastic tubes that you can keep under your sink cabinet. You'll want one of those for stowing all your toiletries.
14. Get a big enough hydration pack that has pockets to store your wallet, phone, all your documents, and sunscreen. It is so worth it!
15. Yes, get the directional lock for your security drawer. No, I don't think you need electrolytes. Your salt and sugar intake is plenty enough from the DFAC, the snack bar, and the vending machines outside the flight rooms. I also don't think caffeine pills are necessary. By the second week, you can make your coffee in the flight rooms, and in the first week, it's not the end of the world if you don't retain the information they give you, because it's mostly administrative housekeeping stuff.
16. Make sure you have a solid data plan. Wifi is so spotty in both the dorms and academic buildings. Most people end up using their phone hotspots.
17. Bring lots of Nyquil and DayQuil. You will 100% get a cold.  Maybe even multiple times if you were me. Nyquil helps you sleep early too, which will aid in your recovery when you're sick, since you will be so sleep deprived at OTS.
18. You don't need the mouthguard for combatives. You WILL need a glasses strap if you wear glasses; they will call you out for not having one.
19. I recommend Biofreeze for aches and pains, it numbs away mosquito bite itches, and it's a great life hack for keeping awake in class. Dab a little on your face and around your eyes, and the icy cold burning sensation will help keep your eyes open lol.
20. You will want to bring big ziploc bags for your mock deployments and for keeping your essential documents dry in your hydration pack. I recommend a few sandwich-sized bags, several gallon-sized bags, and several 2.5-gallon-sized ziploc bags. The latter are great for storing clothes and such.
21. At the mock deployment in Mod 3 the mattresses don't have any sheets or pillows! I never slept more terribly. If it matters to you, bring a pillow and sheet.",4,1754430642.0,airforceots,0,0.83,False

**First impression on a perfume test strip**:4/10 It's not listed as a note/accord, but I'm getting coffee right away with a slight hint of vanilla. I'm not a fan of coffee scents, so I don't really like it. It kinda smells like the inside of a Starbucks lol. Definitely unisex. 


**First impression on my skin**: Oh wow, I got a blast of coffee, like even stronger than it was on the strip. Vanilla is there but it's pretty subtle. Projection is ok.


**Within 1.5 hours of spraying**: I'm still getting coffee, but it is more subdued, and the vanilla is coming through more. Projection has plummeted, though. 


**Within 3 hours of spraying**: So I'm not getting coffee anymore, it's smelling like super buttery shortbread cookies. I get the vanilla more now, too. Even though it's smelling more pleasant, it's still not for me. I have to bring my wrists pretty close to my nose to be able to smell it at this point. 


*Summary*: I know this is a well-known and loved gourmand, but I didn't like it. I got coffee for the first couple of hours, which I'm not fond of at all. The vanilla was pretty subtle up until the 3 hour mark, when it turned into more of a super buttery shortbread scent. I never really got sandalwood or styrax from this. Also, it didn't last that long on me, and didn't project much. Maybe letting my sample macerate and trying it out in the winter would bring something different out of it, so I'll give that a shot. **Final rating: 4/10**",2,1754430480.0,FemFragLab,0,1.0,False

whereas any other time of my cycle in like okay cool this isn’t ideal but I can handle it type vibe lol. 

like for one I work for the airlines (flight attendant) and while in many ways I appreciate and enjoy my job, it’s obvi still a job. and ESP in the summer, things can get incredibly unbearably busy. luckily july (which is lowkey the hardest month for me for various reasons) is finally over, but i’m left feeling drained and behind in various aspects of my life. 

thankfully august is a better schedule for me, and I even have this stretch of multiple days off until friday 🙏  but with my period coming in a week, it’s like I just got out of the beast of july, and now i’m facing pmdd demons instead. 

like on top of all this for some reason my downstairs neighbor decided to start more frequently and disturbingly blasting music, vibrating in my floors, waking / keeping me up. I mean luckily only twice in the past month or so, but obviously still frustrating / wrong. 

last night was really bad. bc 1 it woke me up, 2 I wasn’t having it, let my anger get the best of me, so I slammed a chair on the ground 4 times as a signal for him to quiet down 😭😭 I also broke a mirror trying to slam the ground with it (like it didn’t shatter but the pieces came apart) 😭😭💀 . 

I know I either sound illogical or possibly valid to some people lol. but either way idk I think it made the situation worse bc he genuinely kept the music on till almost 8am, i’m so delirious rn at 4:33pm, I actually can’t even tell if I still lowkey feel vibrations in my floor still or if i’m just losing my mind 😭

see I swear this pms mindset I get sometimes makes me spiral in situations rather than logically handling them if that makes sense? like i also did reach out to my apartment, but i’m so exhausted I don’t feel like thinking about this again until tomorrow. i’m so exhausted that i’m lowkey gonna just spend the rest of today 4:30pm bedrotting, bc I honestly think I was trying too hard to push myself to be productive on these days off and I think I genuinely need a breather. 

other things i’ve spiraled about include a bug bite I got. yeah it was a weird bug bite, and lowkey more painful etc, but I genuinely started spiraling about it as I entered my luteal phase and got very hypochondriac about the worst case scenario. today I am realizing I do think it’s fine, but it’s just exhausting to deal w my own emotional spirals. 

also I know this sounds weird, but since i’ve been up since 12am (thanks neighbor) I went down a rabbit hole watching videos about north korea and a terrible sad story about what happened to a US citizen in 2016, and genuinely I have felt creeped out the entire day since watching that 💀💀😭😭

and I swear, my pms anger is what made me not go back to sleep, like I lowkey chugged coffee out of anger and just decided to start my day instead of trying to calm myself down and try to fall back asleep or at least rest w headphones if that makes sense lol. 

and I was luckily still productive enough today like did some loads of laundry, did my gel nails and did my hair (I know it sounds shallow or small but these things r usually exhausting to me cuz my hair takes a couple hours and nails like an hour but it makes my life sm better when I go back to work and I feel more confident).

I technically had so much more on my list to do, such as doing more research for a trip i’m planning, seeing when my electric bill is due, putting in an order for a bunch of things i’m running out of, research changing bases, setting up a return for clothes I bought but don’t need, etc etc. but I am now realizing I am spent and better off spending the rest of today just resting and letting go of expectations of myself. 

like at least zooming out I see how this rest is “productive” in that I NEED it to recharge. I have been so busy and it has been over a week since I even took a break from exercising. even my day off prior to this I exercised very intensely (bc hair wash day lol) and did even more laundry, washed my hair, cleaned my apartment, grocery shopped, made a nice healthy dinner, responded to important texts etc etc. 

I know this might not sound crazy but I swear I am prone to getting more tired or something lol, and it’s also very validating to myself to see that of course I am tired, I have been so busy with 0 full days of rest. and even if I get rest, I am always sm more tired during this time of my cycle. AND ITS OKAY. and I sometimes forget it’s better and more productive to be more gentle w myself during these times, my energy will come back in a much friendly way if I just give myself an evening or so off. I can hopefully get better sleep and wake up more refreshed tmw. 🙏

ik this was lowkey a bunch of rambling but something about recognizing it and expressing it makes my feelings much less scary and permanent feeling as pmdd sometimes feels when I forget how much it can affect me but also how temporary it can be. and it feels so good to remember this is not permanent and things possibly feel more dramatic and serious than they actually are 😭🙏🙏🙏

omg I have so much more to say but I am delirious and looking forward to my doordash coming and just letting go of my expectations for today 😂🙏

not expecting anyone to deeply read this lol. if anyone skims / relates pls feel free to comment and share ur own experiences 🥰🥰 also if ur skimming and relating in anyway this is ur reminder to be easy on urself and feel hope bc luckily these feelings are temporary 😩🙏

1mimg5m,https://i.redd.it/fbvxjnpiu9hf1.jpeg,A reflection on long haul fatigue,"Flying ACMI in the 747 was equal parts adventure and fever dream. We literally circumnavigated the planet in both directions, seeing unbelievable sights that had previously been abstract concepts in a textbook or maybe National Geographic. The flip side of that was chronic jet lag that would have you stumbling out of the bunk, having possibly suffered a sleepless break, into a surprise view on the flight deck where your shift was about to begin. 

Intuitively, you knew vaguely where you were. You could expect the sun to be up or not. And depending on how rattled around the bunk you got on your break, you might even have predicted a view of cumulonimbus clouds. But whatever your mind might have been expecting, your functioning brain was still on another part of the globe. 

You settle into the seat with your nasty coffee: either Foldgers or Maxwell House, brewed into a carafe that hadn’t been washed since the early aughts. But freight dogs, even on the big iron, would never turn down that burnt cat piss swill served in a styrofoam cup. No, the drug was too essential. Deliver it by any means necessary. 

And for the next several hours, there you would sit, monitoring the big jet. Switch off the center tank pumps when it ran dry. Talk to controllers with a vast range English proficiency and radio quality. Note the fuel score. Dodge weather- because even though boxes don’t complain, hail has already smashed up a few radomes and windshields in recent history. 

Finally you arrive at your destination, perhaps a familiar home away from home like Leipzig or Songdo. Maybe some oddball stop like Ostend or Cyprus. Your body would be on the verge of death by exhaustion, but being locked up in a 747 for 12 hours makes you thirsty and after a quick shower, it would be time to find beer or a cocktail and give your brain that little treat to counter all the caffeine you had been assaulting it with earlier. 

Then, the cruelest fate of all: finally in bed with your body inches away from death and deeply indebted to the elusive god of sleep, you would sink into a deep and powerful slumber only to wake up again in roughly 4 hours. Such was the circadian fog that we lived in for about two weeks at a time. Some rotations were better than others, but there really wasn’t any acclimating to it. A small price to pay for the experience of flying the greatest airliner around the world. ",12,1754430463.0,aviation,3,1.0,False

Just a quick curiosity really, not bothered with anything as coffee tastes great and I’m very happy with it.

I just want to know and understand better why this bubbly kind of start takes place before a proper flow takes place.

Even though I only went for 2 days it was one of my favorite experiences ever.

Recently I started rucking just about every day with a cheap (but pretty good quality) external frame backpack loaded with a 40lb sandbag. I do about 4.5 miles, and generally take 2 stops, one to get water, and the 2nd to put my coffee cup away and use the restroom.

On my days off I do a longer trek, about 6.5 miles, and in the last quarter I find my shoulders going numb or getting uncomfortable. 

I adjust my pack as I go, tightening the waist belt, using various configurations on the shoulder straps/load lifters.

Generally I am pretty comfortable, but when thinking about going on a wilderness backpacking trip I am curious as to what your experiences are.

I know that if I went, say, 6 miles without a rest I would likely be pretty uncomfortable in the neck and shoulders. Perhaps it's a gear issue or something else, but I really wanted to hear other peoples experiences in this regard.

How often do you stop and rest, for example, or what/where do you find discomfort?

1mimd0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/DOR/comments/1mimd0c/dor_early_stage_poi_ivf_success/,DOR (Early Stage POI) IVF Success,"TW: Successful pregnancy / live birth (without IVF)

I know when I first got diagnosed I was scouring the Internet for fertility stories like mine, so I wanted to share briefly on what’s happened so far in our journey to parenthood.

My AMH isn’t too low (I’ve gotten results of 0.58 ng/mL, 0.22 ng/mL, 0.49 ng/mL), but I was diagnosed with early stage POI which seemed even more dire. I’m posting here instead of the POI subreddit because I was (and still am) having menstrual cycles and so it’s not full POI yet, so I think it’s more relevant/sensitive here. 

## *Getting Diagnosed*

Story starts in September of 2023, when I was 30. We hadn’t been planning on trying for children for another 12 months, but I had been having irregular periods and just a gut feeling something wasn’t right. (My periods were between 17 days and 35 days. I realized later I was also having what were actually bad hot flashes, and some other perimenopausal symptoms, like an increase in PMS.)

I ordered a LabCorp OnDemand test, my CD2 results were:
- AMH: 0.58 ng/mL
- FSH: 36.1 mIU/mL
- Estradiol: 23 pg/mL

I saw the AMH was a little on the low side for my age, but after a bit of googling, I found out the FSH was the likely biggest issue — the 36.1 was high. Not the worst possible, but it was not a good number. I called my ObGYN, who immediately told me that the test results were almost certainly wrong and that was fine, which unfortunately was not true. 

A month or so later, we again confirmed my AMH was low (0.22 ng/mL) and FSH was high (30.2 mIU/mL) on CD4. An ultrasound showed my AFC was 3. 

My ObGYN called back apologizing that she was wrong and it looked like the beginning of Premature Ovarian Failure (or Primary Ovarian Insufficiency). 

##*Taking Action*

I didn’t want to wonder what-ifs, so without even trying for a kid, my husband and I jumped straight to IVF. 

Our reasoning was that even if I did get pregnant successfully now, it would be 9 months of pregnancy, then at least another year postpartum before trying, and we couldn’t know that the POI wouldn’t progress further by that point when we wanted to try for a second two years down the road.

Plus, I didn’t want to try for 6 months, then switch to IVF and struggle and wonder — what if we’d started earlier? 

And finally, frankly, we weren’t ready to start trying for a kid right that very second, since we’d been planning on waiting a bit longer before starting to try, and we didn’t feel mentally ready to switch gears so fast. 

We did have some fertility benefits through work, thankfully, and had some money set aside so for us, the potential peace-of-mind seemed worth it. 

##*Getting started*

Our two options we were considering was either CCRM or Hanabusa IVF. CCRM had a longer wait before we could talk to a doctor, and they didn’t seem as experienced with DOR/POI, so I ended up just cancelling that consultation and we went with Hanabusa in San Diego, which meant we had to fly out. 

Being out-of-state was definitely a pain in the butt and expensive, but again, worth it for us because I felt peace of mind knowing we were going straight to the most qualified provider. Let me know if anyone has any questions about how this works, because I remember I was quite confused and had a hard time finding information.

First was just a priming cycle — with CD3 bloodwork:
- FSH: 44.8 mIU/mL
- E2: <25 pg/mL
- LH: 9.1 mIU/mL

Started priming with oral Estrace on CD21. 

Then, we started the first cycle, which ended up being canceled due to early ovulation.

##*3 Egg Retrievals*

I did each egg retrieval with local anesthesia only, since we had low egg counts it was super easy and it was great to be able to just get on with the rest of my day. Since we were flying out to San Diego each ER, we had a mini vacation each time so it was all in all sort of fun. Did each cycle back to back, so each ER was about a month apart. At this point my birthday had passed so I was 31 for all of these. 

ER#1: 
- CD3 AFC: 3
- Retrieved 2 Mature Eggs
- 2 embryos, both euploid, 4AB and 3AB

ER#2:
- CD1 AFC: 2 (and a complex cyst)
- Retrieved 1 Mature Egg
- 1 embryo, euploid, 4AA

ER#3:
- CD2 AFC: 5
- Retrieved 2 mature eggs, 1 immature
- 2 of the eggs degenerated and were discarded on Day 1
- Day 3: remaining egg developed into a 6-8 cell embryo
- Day 6: embryo arrested and discarded
- Result: Failed cycle

I’d gotten a cold at the beginning of the third cycle, which turned out later to have been COVID. So I think that’s was probably what caused the total failure in comparison to the first two successful cycles. I was just too excited by the higher AFC and wanted to keep going. Waste of money, but oh well!

Overall, I was so happy with the results. The first two cycles went great, I was on low doses of the stims so I didn’t have side effects, the retrievals went great. The first two cycles had 100% conversion rate from egg to euploid embryos banked!

##*Taking a break from IVF*

At this point, we did have 3 euploid embryos banked. Since the third cycle was a wash, we decided (and the doctor recommended) we take a break from IVF for a few months, to give my body some time to recuperate. 

At this point it was about 7 months after first getting the bad test results back. So we were more ready to try getting pregnant. Since we had enough embryos banked to feel more confident in our ability to have a second baby even if the POI progressed in the future after a first pregnancy, we decided it was a good time to try to conceive with timed intercourse during that break. 

So that month, we decided to actually try to conceive a baby for the first time. I asked for progesterone (Crinone) for after ovulation since I suspected a short luteal phase, which my doctor was willing to try. 

Lo and behold, we got pregnant that first month, and I gave birth to my first baby at 32. 

We don’t know our plans yet for the second baby, I’ll post an update if we do ever decide to have a second on how that journey goes. 

##*Things I Did*

Impossible to say which of these helped and which did nothing. I will say, the only time I tried acupuncture was before that third failed cycle, so in my book the acupuncture was totally useless lol.

- Red Light Therapy — I used the Celluma Home every night on abdomen. I just found this to be a nice, relaxing nightly ritual so didn’t mind too much if it didn’t help lol. 
- Vegan: already was for years before all this
- No caffeine (again, already wasn’t drink much if any coffee)
- No alcohol (again, already wasn’t drinking)
- CoQ10 (me and husband)
- Fish oil
- Vitamin D
- Lots of avocado and berries

## *Final Thoughts*

If you’re in my shoes, where you haven’t even started trying yet, you just got your bloodwork back and you’re freaking out, I hope you find this helpful. 

I think it’s really important to remember that there is a big difference between getting this bloodwork back after trying unsuccessfully for 6-12 months, and getting it back after testing for no real reason. 

The biggest issue with having low AMH / high FSH is that IVF is going to be harder (fewer eggs). And actually high FSH doesn’t even speak to egg quality, I’m pretty sure that’s a misconception. It’s high LH that impacts egg quality due to lutenizing the follicles early. 

But if you haven’t even started trying yet, you have no idea if you’ll need IVF! This doesn’t necessarily speak at all to your ability to get pregnant. The best test to determine your fertility is trying to get pregnant for 6-12 months. 

I recognize how privileged we were in being able to bank embryos just for peace-of-mind, without it being a big stretch for us. I don’t know how the calculus would have changed for us if that wasn’t easily available. 

Anyhow, happy to answer any questions if anyone finds this from googling your situation, even if it’s a year or two later!",2,1754430255.0,DOR,2,0.75,False

With an iGPU?!?!,"Every once in a while I come across an item that changes my perspective about an entire class of products. Smart washer/dryers were worthless, until I got one and now I can't live without it. Folding phones. WiFi 7 routers. Today I'm officially adding the Asus ROG Flow Z13 to that list, and by extension, integrated graphics cards. The gaming performance on display here is such that I can actually see a future where discrete graphics cards are obsolete. As someone who avoids iGPUs like the plague, this is a shocking turn of events. I wasn't expecting much, but what I experienced has changed the way I'll be playing PC games forever...

Disclaimer: This unit was loaned to me for review as part of the Asus For the Loyal Elite Program and will be returned upon the conclusion of the review period. My opinions are my own. As an aside, I would encourage everyone to check out the Asus Elite Rewards Program where you have the opportunity to earn points weekly to accumulate for gear, gift cards, games, etc. It's a pretty neat program [https://rog.asus.com/us/elite/activity/all](https://rog.asus.com/us/elite/activity/all)

**Unboxing / Hardware Overview**

I'll say one thing for Asus, they've really learned to nail down the unboxing experience. A nice, silver outer package gives way to 2 main boxes, one for the machine itself and one for the 200W power brick. Everything is neatly packed and wrapped in a glossy wrapper. The presentation here is outstanding. 

The first thing you immediately notice about this laptop is how robust it is. It weighs every bit the 2.6 lbs it's listed at, and this is shocking regardless of your perspective. If you go into it expecting a tablet, then WOW, this is heavy. If you go in expecting a laptop, then WOW, this is really light. Either way, the fully aluminum chassis is pretty breathtaking. There's an RGB-laden window on the rear of the device to give it that lighting flare we gamers crave

There's a full-length kickstand at the bottom of the device with a neat, flush tab for easy extension, and it sits on some of the most robust hinges I've ever seen. Under the kickstand is the accessible port for the M2 drive, making swapping it out a simple matter with no full disassembly required.

https://preview.redd.it/0xmyxx6hs9hf1.jpg?width=8160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d53524c4e92bc03058d22747d1795e090617476

I thought I would hate the included keyboard when I first saw it because it looked thin and uninspired. Then I tried it and I'm 100% sold on it. It's a chiclet style keyboard with a magnetic pogo connector and the entire thing folds up neatly over the screen. There's even RGB backlighting, which is great for use in darker environments. All I'll say about the keyboard is don't knock it until you've tried it. I found typing on it to be pretty excellent and it's just about perfect for gaming (VERY short-throw keys...).

As for I/O you have a pretty complete suite here. There's a 3.5mm combo audio jack, a full size HDMI 2.1 port, a 10gb USB 3.2 port and dual USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 ports which both support Displayport and power delivery (huge). There's also a microSD card reader slot and the proprietary Asus charging port they started using in 2025 for the 200W power charging. Finally, there's a dedicated button which is used to call up the Armoury Crate software or indeed anything else you'd like to configure it to do. It's a neat touch, as is the recessed power button which I did not once ever hit inadvertently.

There are dual cameras here, a 13mp rear camera and a 5mp IR front camera which indeed supports Windows Hello. I found logging in via the camera definitely a hit or miss affair, but that has little to do with the camera itself and more to do with how Microsoft implements it (I have issues with my desktop machine occasionally as well). The rear camera is interesting. I didn't think I'd ever use it until I was sitting outside one day and my dog was doing something utterly stupid. No phone in sight, so it was the Flow Z13 to the rescue. Pretty handy...

On the audio side there are 4 speakers present, and I'm VERY happy to report that Asus keeps their tradition of supporting Dolby Atmos here, complete with the full license. Sound quality from these \*small\* speakers is surprisingly good. Definitely passable for gaming and they get plenty loud, but don't expect audiophile quality here, they're just not big enough. The audio jack also supports Hi-Res audio, which is GREAT to see. I'll also mention that this laptop has a 3 microphone array with noise cancelling, and in-game it worked surprisingly well. 

There's WiFi 7 onboard, which for me is pretty neat as I happen to have a WiFi 7 setup. Speeds are...insane. Being able to download games at a 1.9Gbps clip tends to spoil you pretty quickly... *PROTIP: don't waste 45 minutes trying to figure out why you can't connect to your WiFi 7 network until/unless you've installed Windows update 24H2, which apparently enables WiFi 7 support :/*

There's a 13.4 inch 2.5K display here, which Asus insists is a Nebula display. Now, I have an Asus Nebula display on my gaming laptop (Scar 18). It's mini-led and I'm on record as saying it's every bit as good as, if not superior to, OLED and is one of the most breathtaking displays I've ever seen. The display here is...not that one. It's very nice, has a 180hz refresh rate and is a touch screen, but it's neither mini-led nor OLED. It's what they call an ""IPS-level"" display. What this means is that you will see some mild backlight bleed, you will have only a handful of dimming zones and the brightness peaks at 500 nits. To be very clear, this display is absolutely superior to every other laptop display I've tried outside of a few, but when Asus throws around the ""Nebula"" brand I admit I am spoiled and was a bit disappointed here because I know what a true ""Nebula"" display is capable of

Further, the display does indeed support Dolby Vision (and HDR in general)...**but only for video.** It's a really odd thing. Movies and streaming content display DV/HDR (depending on source) just fine, but HDR/DV is completely invisible to all games. I've researched this extensively and it's a design choice on the part of Asus, not a driver or firmware issue. 

Ok finally let's talk about the chipset and cooling. The special sauce here is the AMD Ryzen AI MAX+ 395. It's a ridiculous name (bad) with ridiculous performance (great). More on this in a bit.

There's a unified memory architecture here, with the memory allocated to the GPU adjustable within settings depending on your overall RAM configuration. My unit had 32GB total memory, and after playing around with dedicating 8GB and 16GB to the GPU I settled on 8GB. You can, however, buy this device with 64GB and even 128GB of unified memory and tweak the GPU allocation accordingly.

The cooling is handled by the ""usual"" suite of Asus performance hardware. Vapor chamber? Check. Thermal Grizzly liquid metal paste? Check. Amazing throughput from the cooling fans with dust filters? Also check. They have a formula for success here, and Asus have executed it to perfection once again. The exhaust fans are at the top of the display, which is a pretty great solution for this form factor as it spews the heat completely away from you and whatever surface you're perched on. If you want to have this on your lap (awkward but definitely possible) you don't have to worry about heat cooking your legs whatsoever.

**Gaming Performance**

For me this is the most breathtaking aspect of this machine, and I am thrilled to report that the Flow Z13's gaming performance absolutely shocked me. At a minimum it's on par with an RTX 4060 laptop GPU. In some games it actually outperformed an RTX 4070 laptop. In Manual mode (everything maxed) at default 2560x1600 resolution with all settings maxed and FSR 3 Quality enabled (where available) I was getting minimally 60fps on all of the games I typically play and in most cases far higher. No RT, no frame gen, just pure fps glory. Halo Infinite, Black Ops 6, Forza Motorsport, The Last of Us Part I, God of War, Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077. Turn on frame generation and/or switch to FSR balanced and get 100fps in games like Cyberpunk on max settings? Yes please...On and on, game after game the performance floored me. And again, I cannot stress this enough, these were all at max graphical settings and 1600p. If you're willing to compromise and lower the settings, resolution and/or switch the power profile to something like Performance or Silent, you can absolutely 100% game completely on battery here and it will be the best battery gaming experience you've ever had. For an iGPU to hit nearly 11k in Time Spy is just wild to me

Now these results are obviously going to vary with different games and in different environments. I personally tried to test this laptop in extreme settings (outdoors in 90 degree heat) and achieved the above consistently. The thing is, at no time did I ever experience thermal throttling in these admittedly ridiculous conditions. Fans were loud-ish, sure, but no throttling. When cooler heads prevailed (literally) and I was inside in a 67 degree air conditioned room, performance was the same level of insanity but the fans didn't need to work nearly as hard.

**Battery Life and Fan Noise**

I'm not one to game while on battery, but the portability here just screams to do just that. The newly overhauled Armoury Crate software (new and improved, seriously) is onboard of course, and you tweak the power profile here based on what you're looking for out of the device for each session. The default for battery mode for the 70wh battery is Silent, which for regular everyday use + video watching gave me between 6 and 8 hours of screen time. Again, it's the duality of this product at play. As far as a laptop goes, 6-8 hours of battery is fantastic. Compared to a tablet, 6-8 hours of battery is terrible. As far as fans go, Silent mode certainly lives up to its name as the fan noise barely went above a whisper throughout.

Gaming on battery is a different affair entirely. In silent mode (which adjusts screen brightness, power draw and fan profiles accordingly) I got about an hour and a half entirely on battery (native resolution, max settings). Cranking up to Performance mode increases the burn rate significantly (while of course increasing performance accordingly) and drops you down to about an hour, while switching to Turbo puts you at roughly 45 minutes. Just understand that when you're exclusively on battery you're obviously not going to be tapping into the full power of the iGPU so game performance is going to be throttled down accordingly.

BUT, there's a solution here thanks to the two onboard USB power delivery ports. A cheap, smallish 100W power bank lets you game in Performance, Turbo and even Manual mode (with all metrics maxed out) for 2-3 hours pretty easily with no drop in gaming performance. You'll still drain the battery of course (you need the full 200W brick to actually charge while gaming), but it's a really neat minimalist option to have when you're out and about with no outlets in sight. Fan noise cranks up accordingly, however, and there were times when I was outside on a hot day gaming at max performance and the fans were pretty loud. Not deal-breakingly loud (they're small fans after all), but still definitely noticeable. You can certainly tweak this in AC, but understand that with great power comes great responsibility. And noise. 

**Downsides**

The screen and its 180hz refresh rate kept up with everything wonderfully. It's bitterly disappointing however that HDR/Dolby Vision isn't supported in games as I've grown to become something of a snob with this aspect of gaming these days. It was still a very pleasant visual experience and the ""IPS level"" display is quite good (especially for a touch screen). Nevertheless, it's just a REALLY odd choice, Asus...

Another downside and the elephant in the room with the Flow Z13 is onboard storage. It comes with an M2 slot. This is great. It's a 2230 slot. This is terrible. The only shipping option here is a 1TB drive, which I managed to completely saturate within the first 30 minutes (onboard WiFi 7 FTW!!!). The thing is, because it's the stupid 2230 form factor, you're limited to just 2TB even if you upgrade. As someone who has 2 (TWO) 8TB 2280 drives in his Scar 18, the lack of any real storage option here is criminal and will be a serious bottleneck if you're buying this for gaming. 100GB games are pretty standard, and in the case of stuff like Black Ops 6, well, it's a SERIOUS problem. Again, the WiFi 7 mitigates this somewhat, but still...

[WiFi 7 is the real deal](https://preview.redd.it/cpotsnnqs9hf1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=703024981cc91b19f91e052f1f8ab5172d4e6bfd)

**Conclusion**

I never thought I'd see the day when an iGPU could be a viable gaming platform, yet here we are. To say I've had a blast playing games on this machine is an understatement. The portability to performance ratio is insane and I have actually taken this laptop to places I wouldn't dream of taking my Scar 18. Barbecues, coffee shops, the DMV (yeah...). To be able to play AAA games with maxed out graphics on a 2lb device is just wild to me. *To be able to take that same laptop and seamlessly bring it to the library for work/school or to put it into my gym as a touchscreen for my live training programs is beyond wild, it's a paradigm shift. One thing I didn't even mention (and won't, I'm a gamer after all) is how powerful this chipset is at productivity tasks like Davinci Resolve. It beats my desktop i13700k in 4k rendering...*

AMD really hit it out of the park with the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chipset here, and Asus added their manufacturing superiority to create the ultimate do-everything device. It's a zero-compromise ""gaming machine+"" in the perfect form factor

One of the things I could understand potential buyers struggling with when considering the Flow Z13 is the use case. If you want a tablet you'd probably buy a dedicated tablet. If you want a gaming handheld you'd probably buy that. If you want a gaming laptop or a work laptop you'd buy those. I was like these people and I never even considered the Flow Z13 before this review. After using it as my everyday device for the past 3 weeks, however, I can't imagine anyone considering anything else. It's basically perfection as the ultimate truly portable PC gaming system that happens to be in a tablet form factor. Just, Asus, please, for the next iteration ditch the 2230. My phone has just as much storage, but I'm not running Black Ops 6 or Forza on it...

Currently, I am a student scrolling through endless job boards, feeling like most internships were just glorified coffee runs. Then I stumbled upon something that sounded a little too good to be true: an HR Partner internship with GAO Tek Inc. I'm based in Canada and the idea of working remotely with a global team on cutting-edge tech sounded like a dream.

The company is looking for a new intern to join the team, and I wanted to share my experience and give you the real scoop. This isn't just about padding your resume (though you do get **three** official certificates, which is a nice bonus!). It’s about getting your hands dirty with real AI tools like ChatGPT and HubSpot and seeing how they’re actually used in a professional setting.

**They’re looking for someone who:**

* Is a student or recent grad.
* Has a passion for digital marketing, tech, Social Media and HR.
* Has a knack for writing and a sharp eye for detail.
* Maybe you’ve even played around with Mailchimp or ChatGPT already!

The internship is **3-6 months, fully remote, and open to all of Canada**. The hours are flexible, which is a lifesaver.

If you’re tired of the typical internship hunt and want to dive into the future of marketing, you should check this out. It’s been a genuinely awesome learning experience for me.

I'm still a newbie in 3D printing world (have my printer only around 2 months) and loving this hobby - to the point that few days ago I realized I might have a filament storage problem (more like lack thereof xD).

Spools cluttered floor in my tiny room, so like any fresh printer (3Dprinter?) I started browsing all the model sites to find a suitable solution... To no avail really. I liked the idea of a wall mounted ""rack"" or ""shelf"" w/e u wanna call it, but none of them caught my eye. So I did the only thing left for me to do...

I fired up fusion... Well tutorials for fusion :D

My goal was simple:  
I wanted to design a storage rack/shelf system that would be based on something metal and accessible pretty much all over the globe, and therefore also in my country - my biggest gripe with the models I found interesting, was that they usually used wood (which i didn't want to use) or metal conduits which might be readily available over the pond, but not where I live. And then it hit me...

**IKEA!**

More precisely the **Komplement Clothes Rails.**  
Perfect candidate for designing storage system around. They come in 3 different lengths, 2 colors, are made of metal, sturdy, and easily available. One quick trip to IKEA later I had my rails so I started designing...

...and came up with this:

# the IKEA Komplement Filament Rack System [IKFRS]!

[Two \\""50 cm\\"" segments mounted on the side of my wardrobe one over the other. Clearance for spools removal and storing is accounted for in the design.](https://preview.redd.it/x3t5sk8vp9hf1.png?width=733&format=png&auto=webp&s=70411840a2ba126b022c270a0785b8a87d0e2322)

What you see on the picture (just left and right Holder) is pretty much what I wanted to have and it almost ended there... But then I got the feeling... The inner voice saying ""You can do better, you can improve it, you can make it expandable"".

And so I listened.

More fusion...  
More tutorials...  
More... coffee (ofc)

And finally it was ready! Easy and expandable. The **IKFRS** was born. So I decided to upload it to printables for other people to try it out - it's not a paid model, there's no extra parts hidden under a paywall, just simple system made from IKEA parts, time and filament, for filament :D

1mim6rg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASUSROG/comments/1mim6rg/2024_zephyrus_g16_experience_potential_problem/,2024 Zephyrus G16 Experience + Potential Problem Solutions,"So after switching from Strix G15 Advantage to Zephyrus G16 2024 (GA605WI, Ryzen AI 9 HX370, RTX 4070, 32GB) and owning it for almost a year I can finally share some thoughts on it.

First of all, I should say that this laptop chassis is probably the closest thing to a MacBook that you can get right now. However it is not there just yet.

For instance, I felt kinda scammed when I realized that the laptop is in fact NOT fully aluminum, regardless of what ASUS writes on their website and what some reviewers say. The bottom cover is still made of plastic and is held to the chassis by screws and those awful plastic clips, which feel like they will snap every time you open the back.

Also I have some questions to the hinge mechanism. And I don't mean the wobble. That is actually fine, at least on an AMD model and I believe newer Zephyruses with RTX 50 Series. The problem I have is located between the screen and the edge of the chassis. There is this rounded black plastic thing that covers the hinge. It squeaks A LOT and I just can't stand it. Every minor screen angle adjustment, every slight movement of the laptop on a desk just makes this thing squeak. And once the laptop heats up, plastic expands and it becomes even more annoying.

I just hope that ASUS addresses both of these issues on a new 2026 model.

Now to the hardware part.

So I've had some issues which I will address one by one with respective solutions I found.

**1. CPU sometimes drops down to just 0.61 GHz and the laptop basically becomes unusable**. I've had this happen in two scenarios. One is pretty logical - the TDP limit is way too low (I found mine start doing this at 9W and -19 undervolt. 10W and -19 are fine tho). The second scenario is less intuitive. It has to do with the USB-C charger. When such charger overheats it may reduce the power it sends to the laptop and for some reason the G16 treats it in a weird way where it decides it is best to reduce the clocks instead of supplying the rest of power from the battery. Once you disconnect the cable and have the laptop run off it's battery the clocks immediately go back to normal. 

So if you are like me and have USB-C PD all the time and wonder why your laptop sometimes goes to such low clocks, chances are you got one of those GaN chargers off Amazon and it just overheats. Either buy a different charger or reduce the load on your laptop (more on that later).

**2. Left channel speakers sometimes start playing quietly**, almost like at 1% volume. I'm gonna be honest, not 100% sure what are the exact conditions causing this and how to properly fix it once and for all, but at least I can share what I found from other Reddit posts, ROG forums, general forums and so on. Most of them suggest updating Cirrus Amp Drivers. For some people it even looks like it does the trick, however not for me. I tried using older versions, current version, drivers from other G16s, even versions that are newer than what is officially listed on ASUS support page. I saw no change whatsoever.

For those of you who will try to do that, I should mention something that may save you some time. Don't bother checking the driver version in the device manager. It shows up as a different one from what you have. For instance, I found out that when downloading the drivers from ASUS and extracting them instead of installing, the versions do in fact differ from what was shown on the webpage. 

For example when downloading driver v23.26.47.800 from ASUS the csaudio\_WIP\\csaudio.inf file has v21.51.46.157 specified in it. And that's what shows up in device manager. So don't be fooled and think the installation didn't work. It probably did, just the version that is displayed in device manager is different from what you expect.

Like I said, updating drivers didn't help me personally, so I had to look somewhere else. For instance I noticed that the lower your TDP limit is, the higher the instabilities of amplifier. Also the power plan affects it. There is a setting buried deep in windows control panel that feels like may be the closest thing to the root of the problem. It's called Link State Power Management and it is set to maximum power savings by default. 

From what I understand the amp depends on PCIe-based I2C bus and when Windows tries to do it's best to meet set limits, it sees this setting and cuts power to PCIe devices including the amp. Without much power the amp cannot function properly so some speakers start playing quietly. I am not sure how a low TDP limit may affect this. Maybe Windows tries to do some trick where it goes beyond the set limit for the CPU because it thinks it's way too low for it and instead tries to cut down power somewhere else (so PCIe devices), but I am no expert.

So in general, to somewhat minimize those instabilities you may want to either raise the TDP or go to Control Panel -> Hardware and Sound -> Power Options -> Edit Plan Settings and click ""Change advanced power settings"" there. Then under PCI Express turn off Link State Power Management. Make sure you do that for every plan and maybe even set at least a Balanced plan in G-Helper's Fans + Power -> Windows Power Mode. 

Again this is probably not a 100% solution but a combination of these steps and settings may at least bring back your speakers and have them function 90%? reliably.

**3.** This is a weird one I couldn't find anything online for. My **laptop sometimes just turns off and wouldn't turn back on, no matter what** you do or how long you press the power button. The battery is not a problem, it has 94% health and when it happens it has enough charge. After being completely clueless why that happens for a couple months, I think I found the root of the problem. 

I believe it is a faulty light sensor on the motherboard. It is there as a safety feature for when you open the back of the laptop. So that the battery is disconnected and there is no power while you work on it. This makes perfect sense, as I later noticed that this only happens during day and in bright conditions or when sitting next to a fireplace with no cable connected (which implies it is an infrared sensor). The cable part is crucial, since this acts as an override for this safety mechanism and it is also the only way to turn the laptop back on once the light sensor is triggered. Once the cable is connected you can press the power button and it will turn on. It doesn't matter if the wattage supplied is enough to charge the laptop or not, even a 5V 1A (so 5W) charger is enough to revive it. 

I have not personally fixed this issue myself and I believe ASUS are the only ones who can do it, I just don't have enough time to go through RMA with all my studies and projects. Probably should tho, before warranty expires. However, given that I mostly use this laptop on cable (in order to preserve battery health) it is more like a minor inconvenience for me.

**--------------------------**

So those are the problems I had with my G16. 

**Now to the benefits.** This laptop is pretty much PERFECT. Like ASUS almost completely nailed it this time. Starting with design, to display to sound quality to battery life and performance. 

Let's go one by one.

**1. Design:** I wasn't completely a fan of the slash, just felt like the Matrix in previous generations was a cooler look, but after seeing it in person I took that back. It is simple, elegant, it fits the laptop's ideology. It is not something you would be ashamed of in a coffee shop, plus you can always turn it off if you want. I just wish there was an option to configure personal animations or have them change based on context.

Otherwise the laptop is basically perfect in design. I wouldn't want anything different.

**2. Display and sound:** Just perfect. OLEDs are really up there. And 600 nits peak is pretty good tbh, I never felt like I wanted more brightness. And paired with 6 speaker array it is such a pleasure to watch movies on especially in Dolby Atmos. This is also my first laptop where I actually listen to music on built in speakers. And with somewhat recent Apple Music update to support Atmos it became even better (I know some people prefer the normal mix, but I personally would choose Dolby Atmos all day, really huge fan).

**3. Now for the battery life and performance**. I had a hard time making a choice when buying this laptop. I really wanted AMD because of battery life (and my previously positive experience with G15 Advantage which had AMD CPU and GPU) but I just felt like the RTX 4070 wasn't gonna cut it. So I almost pulled a trigger on a U9 RTX 4080, but found a deal on AMD at the last moment. And I'm glad I did. For me RTX 4070 turned out to be enough and the benefit of having an AMD chip especially with such strong integrated graphics was worth it. 

Now, hear me out, but 95% of the time I actually have my dGPU disabled. Yes, even for gaming. More than that, I usually play in Silent mode with just 20W TDP. The Radeon 890M is just that good even on such low power levels, especially paired with probably the best software to control GPUs - AMD Adrenalin. The upscaling on driver level is such a good feature. And it allows for actual power optimization.

Here's a cool example. Know that game that blew up recently - Peak? Well I decided to play with my friends. I wasn't home at the time and only had a 100W charger with me. So I first ran the game on RTX and it was great, Turbo profile, 2560\*1600 native, highest settings possible, 100+ FPS. The problems started 20 minutes in, when I realized I had only 10% battery left despite being plugged in. So I had to take some time to see how I could optimize the game. End result? Silent profile, 20W TDP, iGPU only, setting in Adrenalin software to upscale from 1000p to 1600p and I had 65 FPS. And the game looked exactly the same in quality. I didn't feel like I'm missing something, kinda the opposite actually considering I was having the same experience (ok 65 is not the same as 100 but it's still smooth) for less noise and considerably lower power draw. Now I could've gone a step further and turned AMD's Frame Gen on, but it is not that good yet.

When it comes to demanding games like Cyberpunk they obviously require lots of horsepower to run, but even then there is a solution that bridges the gap between an RTX 4070 and a 4080. It's called Lossless Scaling. I know, more AI stuff, AI upscaling, AI generated frames, everything AI. I hate it too. And naturally this is NOT a fair comparison, but this is not the point. The point is to show people who are presented with a weird choice: either Intel and 4080/4090 or AMD and up to only 4070 (also applies to G16 with 50 Series) that choosing an AMD laptop may make more sense for some of them. Sure if you know you definetely need that extra VRAM or extra power to run your specific tasks, go for the top GPUs. But if you are like me and you will only use this laptop for studies (yes, even CAD, I am an automotive engineering student myself) and sometimes for gaming, then you should probably go with AMD instead. 

When talking numbers for Cyberpunk this is how I personally play the game: 

Initial Windowed Borderless 1920\*1200, every graphics setting maxed out, basic Ray Tracing is fully turned on. Ray Traced Lighting is set to Ultra (1 lower than Psycho), Path tracing is disabled. DLSS Transformer Model set to Balanced with 0.6 Sharpness. DLSS Ray Reconstruction and DLSS Frame Gen are enabled. Produces initial \~85 FPS. Then turn on Lossless Scaling with following settings: Scaling Type BCAS, 0.6 Sharpness, scale by factor 1.3333 (so from 1200p to panel's native 1600p), Frame Gen using LSFG 3.1 with a fixed multiplier 1.5. 

Now comes the beautiful part. Lossless Scaling is ran on iGPU. So those extra horsepower from a pretty powerfurl 890M that would otherwise be lost are now helping by first of all taking the upscaling load off RTX (the 4070 doesn't have to upscale from a higher base resolution if you want to play on DLSS Balanced and have 1600p in the end) and it also draws some extra frames because why not. There's virtually no artefacts with those settings and the game looks incredible. Input lag is not noticeable in such game, I have no issues with it. So in the end what you are looking at is 1600p in highest settings possible, very high RT settings and 120FPS. I know some of you may be skeptical seeing there is twice the normal AI upscaling and Frame Gen involved, but I assure you it is actually good. This quality made me want to finally finish the game. I previously never actually did, even though played it on launch, simply because it looked like hot garbage. It also didn't run well on my previous RX 6800M, mostly because RT was basically impossible on it (like 20 FPS) and FSR was nowhere near as good as DLSS (especially the newer Transformer model).



So would I recommend the G16?

I feel like I'm falling from a cliff, and that my brain is gonna shut down if I don't force myself to ""wake"" myself up, jolting, gasping, and for the last few weeks, shaking like I was about to have a stroke.

It is to the point where I'm becoming terrified to go to sleep. 
I don't have big anxiety issues, I don't drink coffee or 'exciting' drinks, I'm rather fit and don't have any physical problems. 

I can't even doze off in a car, or a train, or a bus for a long travel because I'll ""wake up"" (even though I'm not asleep yet) shaking and screaming, and I'm scaring the shit out of everyone nearby. It's like I'm stuck between being awake and being asleep, and it feels like my brain is gonna shut down if I don't open my eyes. 

So if everyone knows what is happening, and how to get better, I'll take it. The two doctors I saw didn't gave a shit, just out me on sleeping pills, but it doesn't change anything....

1mim4rl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1mim4rl/went_on_a_first_date_with_no_teeth/,Went on a first date with no teeth,"Title slightly exaggerated.

On Sunday I msgd a women some random comment about her pfp. She replied back, i said thanks (i expected the convo to end here) she writes back the next morning with no problem, and I said I do have a problem (atp im just joking a bit cause I'm bored and u can also see on my pfp the other day I was talking to a scammer so I didn't really care/try) she asked what problem, and I say ""I dont have anyone to explore istanbul with"" (im turkish but speak only english and recently moved back to istanbul) ok so that peaks her interest a bit, we have a small, short convo. During that convo we realize we live pretty close to each other. I tell her the exact neighborhood im in and she's there too. So I ask her out to coffee, she's down. Yippie? (Also the coffee place i picked was VERY CLOSE to her house so this likely freaked her out)

Here's the thing, I just got dental work done and im missing my front 6 teeth atm (also on my profile) so when i ask to confirm, i come clean about my teeth, give her the chance to opt out cause why would anyone wanna go ona date with someone like that (also why tf did i even ask knowing that I have no teeth lol) but alas she gives me a chance.

Okay 9pm coffee date, I head there and she wants to move to different coffee shop down the road cause its quiet here, understandable, so we go. I asked her if she had been on a date before from the app, she says yes, I tell her she's my first and told her I prefer to meet people irl and not online cause you never know who your meeting. Possible mistake, I tell her ive never had coffee before (true statement but I thought it'd make me a bit more interesting?) She's a bit shook, I told her im basic, no tea, no sodas, just water. I make a joke how I lied and I do drink a lot of soda (I use to not anymore).. she says im unique, yay...

We sit down, talk. OK I forgot what to talk about. It's difficult for me to make up convo on the spot to random people. I went on a museum date in May (also on my profile) and that was with someone I got to know over the course of 4 months so I knew what to talk about and stuff. But yea I ask the typical shit like wyd for fun, work, hobbies, small life stories, ect. I think my biggest flaw is I act stupid asf sometimes. Like she wanted me to close my eyes and imagine an apple (she writes stuff/stories) so I take off my glasses, she laughs at this. Like why did I take off my glasses to close my eyes lol. At some point I ask if I look foreign since I grew up in America and not turkey, she says I do look turkish but I act and handle myself as american. The way I walk, sit at the table, talk in general screams USA. Lastly, her profile said she likes talking about personal stuff and trauma so I tell her the truth about my life with no lies. I obviously didn't take over the convo with a woe is me type vibe but I answered truthfully to what she asked me. (Looking back i wonder if this was a mistake) 

An hour passes and we get up to leave and we walked a bit and I deadass said the stupidest thing ever ""did you walk here?"" She said she didn't want to answer that (fair, she doxxed herself slightly already) i said sorry that was weird (I was nervous asf) and we stop, shake hands and get on our way. I knew immediately from the handshake that it was over for me. Went back home and saw i was unmatched 🥲 which sucks cause I would've asked if she enjoyed the date and ask if date 2 was in the future (I should of done this in person) so rip me. 

All in all, as someone who wasn't dated in a long time, this was good practice (im coping) and I can only hope she had an ok time too. Now I'm left wondering if the deal breaker was me or the teeth. 

TLDR: went on a date with no front teeth as I heal for implants, got unmatched and now am wondering if it's me or the teeth. ",1,1754429702.0,Bumble,1,1.0,False

Just finished my third round of roasting Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, this time using the SR800 with a temperature probe and logging with Artisan. Still getting the hang of it, but I have to say, the Artisan experience was pretty cool and helpful to visualize the roast in real time.

Started with 225g, ended with about 15.6% weight loss. This batch looks and smells a bit better than my earlier ones—definitely learning more each time. Planning to study the roast curve in more detail and cup it in a few days to see how it turned out.

One more round with these Yirgacheffe beans, and then I’m planning to switch to a different origin—excited to explore something new. Open to suggestions if you have a favorite!

The tank capacity and dimensions are crucial considerations. Most fish tank coffee tables range from 20 to 40 gallons, providing ample space for a variety of fish and plants. Typical dimensions are around 48 inches in length, 24 inches in width, and 18 inches in height. This size allows for a comfortable viewing experience while fitting seamlessly into most living rooms. The dimensions are balanced to ensure the well-being of the fish, providing adequate room to swim and explore.**Filtration System:**

An integrated filtration system is essential for maintaining a healthy aquatic surroundings. High-quality fish tank coffee tables often include multi-stage filtration systems, comprising mechanical, chemical, and biological filtration.

The use of tempered glass is paramount for safety and durability. Tempered glass is considerably stronger than standard glass, making it resistant to cracks and breaks.

## faqs Section

Addressing commonly asked questions ensures potential buyers are well-informed and confident in their purchase.

**How often does the water need to be changed?**
Water changes should be performed regularly to maintain a healthy aquatic environment. Typically, a 25% water change is recommended every two to four weeks, depending on the size of the tank and the number of fish. It's crucial to use dechlorinated water to avoid harming the fish.

Cleaning is relatively straightforward with the right tools and techniques. an algae scraper can be used to remove algae from the glass,and a gravel vacuum can be used to clean the substrate. Regular water changes also help to keep the tank clean and healthy. Avoid using harsh chemicals or soaps, as these can be harmful to the fish.

**What type of fish are suitable for a fish tank coffee table?**
Smaller, peaceful fish species are best suited for fish tank coffee tables. Some popular choices include neon tetras, guppies, and bettas.Avoid overcrowding the tank and ensure that the fish are compatible with each other. Research the specific needs of each species to ensure they thrive in the aquarium environment.

**Does the glass get scratched easily?**
While tempered glass is durable, it is still susceptible to scratches. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or materials that could scratch the surface.

I’m in my 20s, living in Springfield, and looking to expand my circle a bit. Life’s busy with work and school, but I’ve been realizing I miss having some good people to hang out with, talk to, or just share a hobby.

I’m into things like:

* Gaming (video games or board games)
* Fitness (trying to stay consistent with gym stuff, open to lifting or posture accountability)
* Sci-fi/fantasy (big Star Wars nerd)
* Tinkering/DIY (just started learning soldering and electronics)

I’m pretty laid-back and don’t expect instant best friendships—just looking to meet some decent folks to hang with occasionally, whether it’s grabbing coffee, joining a group event, co-op gaming, or just talking about life or random nerd stuff.

1milvvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Enneagram/comments/1milvvq/typing_questionnaire_looking_for_opinions_input/,typing questionnaire; looking for opinions + input to reflect on.,"* Tell me about your internal experience of yourself. What makes you, you?

my internal experience of myself. i mean, there's a lot in there LMFAO. constant ideas, visualizations, and opinions; ever-shifting kaleidoscopic thoughts and feelings; lots and lots of planning, speculating, thinking and worrying.

* You just had a really good day. Describe it. It can be a real recent example or an aspirational one.

aspirational really good day: i wake up in a tropical resort hotel suite. the temperature is cool and mild, the sun warm but not devastating, lights up my room to wake me up. the room is open, nice and clear, clean and organized, with all my belongings that i need visible and easy for me to use. i wake myself up by making a nice cup of coffee to enjoy on the balcony over looking the gorgeous, clear blue sea. when i'm done, i get ready for the day, dressing myself in swimwear. as soon as i'm done, i head down for the water. i swim and scuba dive with my lover for hours, laughing playing in the water.

we take breaks to reapply sunscreen, snack and have a cocktail every so often. we do this until sunset, when we take some more time getting comfortable in the sand, around a bonfire. we talk about the new people we've met here, we talk about our favorite moments of the day. we soon make out and have some heavy petting going on, until we need to go back to the suite to freak. that lasts a few hours, countless finishes to be had. then i slip away for a long, hot shower, which i finish up with by moisturizing and slipping into clean, cozy pajamas. i spend some time reading quietly by myself out on the balcony before, finally, getting ready for bed. i cuddle my partner until i fall asleep.

* If someone is upset with you, what is the typical reason for it? Give a recent example.

a recent example could be when i was tense and snappy in my tone of voice while speaking to my partner? i don't even remember what we were talking about but i got focused on feeling misunderstood and attacked, then got defensive and snappy, which made it harder for me to listen to her and show up as kindly as i usually do. people can get upset with me for being flaky, distant, defensive, argumentative, overly nitpicky/fixated on details, taking things too seriously, not taking good care of myself/stressing myself out, and, apparently, pretentious.

* What are you like when you're stressed? What are your coping mechanisms? Give an example of a recent stressful situation and how you handled it.

when i'm stressed... ugh, oh god. the more stressed i am, the more obsessed i get with trying to 'fix' everything, mentally fixate on TASKSTASKSTASKS, all the tasks, need to do everything everywhere as much as i can, need to fit as many tasks into my day as possible, NEED to dododo fixfixfix, i'm the taskmaster. i desperately grasp for as much control over my environment and everything in it as possible. i'm so insufferably tense that every conversation with me is about some type of work and i'm just stuck fixated on that. i'm hard to talk to, easy to piss off, impatient, greedy, bossy, demanding, and need everything perfect. i'm emotionally volatile.

* What pushes your buttons? What makes you angry? How does your anger manifest? Can you be openly angry with others?

loool too many things push my buttons, but i also don't take everything that makes me angry seriously, because i know i'm a person who has intense, easily roused feelings and that they're entirely my own. it is easy to make me irritated, though. if someone says something stupid or wrong about something i care about, i can get irritated. if someone is walking slowly in front of me, i can get irritated. if someone says one thing and then does another, i can get irritated. if someone refuses to take accountability when they fucked up, i can get irritated. if i don't feel respected or if i feel mocked, i can get irritated. i feel anger in a lot of ways, but usually very bodily. tense, burning limbs that need to move to discharge angry energy; clenched muscles everywhere - my jaws, limbs, hands, torso; headaches; scathingly enraged, critical thoughts racing through my mind; urges to yell, cuss at someone to give them a piece of my mind, and/or other destructive + physical urges.

* What’s your deepest fear? Why is that your fear?

i have way too many fears to know what my deepest one is, dude... maybe, if i had to guess, it'd be that i live a wasted life, where i leave no lasting mark, where i don't showcase and make use of my talents and gifts, crippled by regret by the time i take my last breath. i'm also deeply afraid of deteriorating with alzheimer's or something similar, and of never being able to enjoy the present moments in life, always striving toward some future where i can finally 'enjoy' life, but that future never comes. only when moments have passed me by am i able to enjoy what i had back then.

* What types of memories cause you the most shame? What feelings cause you the most shame? What is it about them that causes you shame?

memories that i feel ashamed of... uhhhh. it's hard to say? i guess times where i embarrassed myself in front of other people. oh, and times where i was absolutely desperately head over heels for someone who didn't give a shit about me, and i went out there doing the absolute most, professing my devotion, begging and pushing for this person's attention constantly like a fool, trying SO hard to seduce them and win them over. particularly when the person ended up just being kind of a douche. others would be times where i've let my urges for vengeance and destruction win, and lashed out at people who i love and cherish most. feelings that cause me the most shame... need/neediness, desperation, vulnerability, hurt, attraction, horniness. i feel ashamed of them because i just feel... gross? i feel helpless and way too at the mercy of someone else. i just feel like i'm prime for being made a mockery of and taken advantage of.

* What is your relationship with pleasure? What gives you pleasure? Can you have pleasure when you want it, or do you have to earn it?

i feel like there's a beast in me that's a slave to pleasure and that i'm constantly trying to keep it in check, chain it down, and restrict it. i feel ashamed of the beast in me and how much i want to chase pleasure just for the fuck of it. i have this fear that if i let go, i know i'll be deeply engrossed in that chase, fixated on feeling good for god knows how long, and i won't have nearly so many resources available to be considerate of consequences, of other people, of myself. naturally, that beast cannot be contained and i seek pleasure anyway. i generally feel entitled to my pleasure when i want it. on the more negative side, i can be impatient and demanding about my pleasure, as well as nitpicky and wanting it just right, wanting it my way, to match my ideal.

mentally i don't think it's wrong for me to take pleasure in whatever i want provided i'm not hurting unwilling people or harming anyone, including myself. emotionally/gutturally, i feel like i 'should' earn pleasure. in reality, i don't have the patience. i'm tired and i've done enough work, i want to feel good and i want it now. i turn to all kinds of sexual and kink exploration for pleasure as a priority. i also seek pleasure from good food, creative expression aligned with my passions (fiction writing, roleplay, dance performances, singing and songwriting), relaxing care of my body and skin (so like hot baths/showers, sauna, skincare, massages, etc etc), time spent in water/nature, and parties/events.

* What’s your relationship with authority? Think both abstractly and with specific authorities in your life, possibly your parents, boss, religious leader, doctor, or government figures? Are you an authority?

well, the relationship is definitely complicated. i feel tense and testy about authority. i can see some of what i imagine to be six-ish tendencies to vacillate with feeling against and provocative against authority or to trust it too blindly. as a child i fought with my primary caregiver frequently and explosively. teachers that were kind, however, i felt very cared for by and quickly became teacher's pets to. bosses have loved me and also expressed being flabbergasted by my flippant disregard of their authority, and my treating them like just anyone, or as an equal to myself. i do see this in myself where my brain kinda sees itself as separated from those structures that determine authority. and that, despite being able to detect these structures, my brain doesn't see itself as actually part of them. and so we treat everyone accordingly. but then there are sometimes where we do feel more immersed in them, in a position of feeling a need to 'please' a perceived authority, and are nervous to impress/fawn to them. i'm an authority on myself and my experience. that's about it.

* When your mind wanders, what are you thinking about?

plans, what am i going to do, haha that's funny/cute, how is A going to fit into my day with BCDE, if C takes too long then i have to move D to maybe tomorrow and then E to friday, ew this is boring, man i'm tired, when did i last eat, i need to move around and get some exercise/go outside, what problems might come up tomorrow with this plan, how can i prepare for those.

* You have a big decision to make. Describe how you decide what to do.

think very thoroughly about it. write out all my thoughts. pros and cons. lists. research where applicable. read other peoples' experiences with the thing. have conversations with a couple of trusted people in my life, consider their opinions and experiences. gather everything and sleep on it. weigh everything in balance according to priority. if things go well, i will settle on a choice and proceed with that. if everything goes badly and i'm losing it and nothing is making any sense no matter how much i try, how many breaks i take or whatever, choose on impulse and hope i didn't fuck up royally.

* What’s your biggest flaw?

my OCD, probably. and i mean that in a clinically diagnosed sense; i was born with it. if i had to condense that it would probably be to 'obsessive fixating/inability to let things go/be content with what 'is'.'

* What makes you special? (Or, if you don't feel special, what at least makes you different from other people?)

everything about me in combination with each other combines into a perfectly imperfect unique something that makes me special. i do have a rare ability to pick up on social and emotional subtleties that many miss. i'm also very fanciful and impractically romantic in the type of way that characters from storybooks are.

* How much of your mental energy is spent on thinking about each of the past, the present, and the future?

the past... probably 35%. the future... probably 62%. the present... probably 3%.

* You unexpectedly find yourself with a whole weekend with no obligations, and everyone else is busy. How do you feel about it? What do you do?

there's probably small bursts of sad/loneliness at first and randomly throughout, but other than that, i'm vibing. i'll be trying to prioritize self-care and rest and just doing whatever i want, which will probably involve at least something outdoors, and time spent connecting to my body, music, sexual exploration...

* What’s your personal vibe/style/aesthetic? How cultivated vs natural is it, and how much time do you spend on it? Do you turn it on and off?

my personal style shifts according to my mood, but the variations tend to be pretty distinct. to me it feels natural because it's based on my emotions which feel natural to me. sometimes it's pastel cotton candy clouds, elven fae and sparkle. sometimes it's subtle fem dark academia goth. sometimes it's comfy modern cottagecore. idk how to measure the time i spend on it, but i don't think it's excessive... though i do spend more time on it than my partner does. i guess you could say i turn it on and off depending on if i'm dressed up or not, but my natural aura that is just *me* is of course always there.

* Which of the following is the most like you? Explain. A) I know what I want, I go out and make it happen, and people won't stop me. B) I am content to be on my own and not draw too much attention to myself. C) I have to be responsible and dedicated, and I put others’ needs first.

probably A. then C, then maybe B.

* Which of the following is most like you? Explain. A) I dislike stress and negative vibes, and I may try to distract myself from my problems. B) I have strong feelings, get worked up easily, and am not afraid to show it. C) I don’t like to let my feelings show; they get in the way of being efficient and logical.

absolutely B. then A. C is like not even close lmfao.

* Which of the following is most like you? Explain. A) I look to others for feedback and guidance and am willing to be flexible when needed. B) I am always aware of how things could be better, and I’m disappointed that they are not. C) Deep down, I am afraid people won’t give me what I need unless I make it worth their while.

B, then A, then C.

What are your tips for maintaining energy throughout the day?

I’m in my mid-30s and am about to start working full-time. My wake-up time is 4:45am, start work at 6am, and I’m home by about 3:45pm. I also have an aging mom with uncontrolled diabetes that I help, friends, nephews and nieces (babysitting occasionally), a partner, an old dog with mobility issues, and hobbies/goals. It’s a lot to juggle and I find myself lying down a lot after work with little to no energy. 

Info that might be helpful to know: I usually drink one cup of coffee in the morning. I’m usually getting in bed in between 9:30-10:30pm, but sometimes it’s later. I’m not deficient in any vitamins or minerals. I have inattentive adhd and have been in mental health recovery. I take anti-depressants but haven’t taken my adhd meds in a while (ran out and my psych quit, so I’m in limbo with that right now). 
I’ve always had sleep issues. I can’t just get into bed, close my eyes, and fall asleep within a few minutes. 

What I know I can improve is: meal prepping, eating enough in the mornings, getting into bed at an earlier time, staying off my phone while in bed (pfffft), making one day a week just for me (and only me) time…

About a year and a half ago, a new manager came in. She’s around 50, and when she first started, things were fine, she kept her distance and didn’t try to overstep. But as she got more comfortable, she became increasingly rude and aggressive. She would yell at employees in front of customers, overreact to small mistakes, and generally made the workplace toxic. One time, I left at the end of my scheduled shift (like I was supposed to), and she later texted me angrily, saying I shouldn't have left and should have stayed because it was busy even though I had already finished my hours. That was the moment I knew I had to quit. I put in my two weeks notice, and today was my last day. I’ll admit, I woke up a bit cranky, but I didn’t take it out on anyone. I just kept to myself. Most of my coworkers (who I actually like and care about) noticed I was in a bad mood. At the end of my shift, I was getting ready to leave. My manager called me over. I said “okay” and walked over toward her and a few other coworkers. Then, one of them slapped me in the face with whipped cream. Now I know that might sound funny or harmless to some, but the whipped cream we use is super thick. It got in my eye, I couldn’t breathe properly for a few seconds, and I lost the back of one of my earrings. I just walked away and started washing my face off. I didn’t scream or make a big scene. While I was cleaning up, I overheard one of my coworkers saying, ""I told you guys this was a bad idea."" Turns out three coworkers told my manager not to go through with this idea, but she still pressured another coworker to do it anyway. Yes, I cried a little. I blamed it on getting the whipped cream in my eye, but honestly I just felt humiliated and hurt. Once I cleaned up, I clocked out and left without saying much. What really stings is that she told me “Oh, this happened to me when I left another location!” like that somehow justified it. But… I’ve seen many people leave this place over the years, and I was the only one who ever got something like that done to them.

So I guess I’m asking… am I overreacting for feeling upset? I just wanted to finish my last shift and leave quietly. Instead, I left embarrassed and hurt.

Alessa jogged as she exited the blue tram. As she did she slurped the last bit of nutrient swill from a packet she'd bought from the tram's dispenser and tossed it absently into a recycler on one of the street corners.

""E.T.A.?"" She asked her AI.

""At current rate you will arrive with two minutes to spare."" Lucky responded from her earring.

Alessa picked up her pace. She preferred to be early, and two minutes was not her idea of being such.

Nobody paid her any mind as she jogged. A sword over her shoulder and a revolver on her hip were nothing to gawk at. Weapons were the norm these days. Not like when she'd first crossed over to this universe.

Back then the Earth-based government that would eventually form E.M.A.G. had been very strict about who could and couldn't CARRY weapons or use magic in public.

But between the ten or so new universes that had been discovered and integrated (with varying levels of success, as her world showed), the different species and cultures of peoples, and the new beasts and monsters accompanying them, the government had effectively given up on trying to STOP people from being armed. Instead they'd adopted the same policy that most Earth firearm stores had had for centuries. And after a few decades had even implemented the ""First to draw, first to fall"" law, along with intensifying punishment for violent criminals.

It wasn't perfect. But Alessa's weapons and armor were, if anything, light compared to some of the people she passed on the street.

A pair of half-orcs, brothers if she had to guess, were conversing with a dwarf and a Hisstian as they drank coffee. The half-orcs both had what appeared to be customized shotguns slung on their backs. The dwarf had his familial axe on his belt. And while she couldn't tell, she was fairly certain the snake-like Hisstian had some kind of S.M.G. under his coat.

Lucky calculated what he suspected each one of being and notated it for her in case she needed the info during a fight. Not that she would.

And only a few yards away a pair of M-Sec officers were chatting with the vendor of the hot dog cart on the corner, completely uncaring of the armed group nearby.

Mars was a (relatively) newly colonized world, having only gotten its first fully functional Habitation Dome installed some twenty years ago. It had expanded quickly, with the aid of magical enchantments and Gate technology speeding up the process tremendously. As such, it had an ""All are welcome"" policy to help grow its population.

In short... it was the new version of Earth's ""Old West"". People could come and go as they pleased. Laws were lax so long as you weren't harming anyone. Weapons were a common part of people's attire. And for an exile like her, from a banned universe, staying anonymous was easy enough as long as you kept your head down and followed the rules.

It was as she thought of this that she rounded the corner and saw the warehouse with the massive number ""4"" painted on its front side.

A line was formed up at the small door near its corner, and a massive Ogroid in khaki pants and a black polo was barring entry as a human in similar attire screened the files of those in the line. All of whom were clearly mercenaries like her.

""Dammit."" She said as she slowed down and ambled to the back of the line, taking her place behind an insect-like Qakodian. Its compound eyes swiveled their focal point behind them to look at her for a moment before turning back toward the door.

She looked past them just in time to see the Human near the door hold his hand over his ear and listen to something for a moment. Then he looked and scanned the line.

She knew what was happening. It had occurred often enough with Stat inclined jobs that she expected it.

Sure enough, as she stepped to the side, he honed in on her and moved to signal her forward. She looked above him and his partner at the little security camera up above on the wall, and nodded.

Then she marched past all the suddenly grumpy mercenaries in line and up to the two guards.

""Fajeon?"" The human asked. She nodded. ""You're the last one on the list. Head on in, they're waiting for you."" She nodded again and moved past as he put his tablet in his cargo pocket and addressed the line. ""Alright. List is closed. So unless you have some truly incredible shit on your resume, you might as well head on home."" The line groaned and complained, and one person started to speak up proudly, but the door shut behind her before she could hear any more.

Inside was a scene just like the dozens she'd seen before. Hell, even the warehouse setting was typical for these kinds of jobs.

Most of the warehouse was taken up by its usual cargo. But the section near the door she'd come in, and by the massive bay doors, was occupied by armored cars, crates with arms and armor, and a small area where a group of armed people, ten or so, like herself were currently chatting. A smartly dressed business woman was standing in front of a 3D display and answering questions as Alessa approached.

As she did the woman speaking noticed her and held up a hand.

""Ah, Miss Fajeon, glad you could join us."" She said as the group turned to look at her. She recognized a few faces, but most were unknown to her. ""We were just about to begin full briefing.""

""Perfect timing."" She replied as leaned against a crate that had dwarven symbols on it that Lucky translated as saying \[Reflecting Shields\].

""Indeed."" The woman replied. ""Before you get too settled I have to ask. Would you be willing to be Team lead?""

The question rankled a few of the other mercs present. She even saw a were of some kind, literally raise their hackles at the perceived slight. But, like the way she'd skipped the line outside, she was used to this.

""Can I give you an answer after the brief?"" She asked in return.

""That would be fine."" The woman replied with a fake smile as the Ogroid from outside appeared, remarkably quietly, and took up a seat on the hood of one of the vehicles behind her, arms crossed.

""Why's she get the offer?"" An deep elf across the room asked.

""Because she's who my company desires as team lead."" The lady answered coolly. ""Now please save questions for in a minute once I've gotten some details out.""

She gestured at the display next to her and the sensors read the gesture and the map of Mars's surface zoomed in on an area next to the city Primus Olympus, where they were at now. A blinking marker appeared next to the city's northeast airlock gate.

""So. I'm Chana Espejo. Mission Representative for Poecel Pharmaceuticals. You all signed N.D.A.'s upon acceptance of this job, with time starting once you entered the door."" She said before turning to the display again as they all nodded. ""It's an escort job. High priority cargo. Starting point is at Northeast Air-Gate five. Barring damage to the cargo container you are not to look at it, or question us about it. It's non-toxic and not dangerous. Simply valuable to my company, and highly sought by our competitors."" She gestured and the blinking marker began moving toward the mountain. ""Unfortunately it's also not Gate-stable so we're moving it the old fashioned way between Primus and the Karzok dome.""

Alessa looked at the vehicles behind the woman, including the one the Ogroid was resting on. That trip explained the EVA tracks and airlocks.

""Armored atmospheric suits will be provided."" The woman continued as the path on the map climbed the side of the massive mountain their city was named after and continued around its base. ""We don't expect any issues with the Volcanic Nomads. But you know how they are.""

Near Alessa a few of the merc began whispering about the nomads. They were just wandering druids who had, once upon a time, been tasked with seeding Mars's surface with life and growing its atmospheres. Most were peaceful. but some took the defense of the meager ecosystem quite seriously. And they always wanted supplies and material to help them survive the scarcity out there. Plus some were damn near feral.

""Distance and terrain give us a minimum three day trip."" The woman continued, ignoring the murmurs. ""But between expected interference and the potential for the UN...expected... we've put a one week window on delivery. The faster you get there the bigger the bonus at the end of the trip. And naturally we'll ferry you back here if you desire. We have gotten defensive allowances expanded for the trip. Though ONLY defensive."" She said with a tone that said that was non-negotiable.

""So no preventative initiative?"" An older, partially prostheticized human asked.

""Only if it's determined absolutely necessary."" She replied. ""As always there ARE eyes in the sky. And we do have to turn over all sensor data in the event of an investigation. Mister Kirchner, you've worked in this field long enough. You know what that means.""

The older man, Kirchner, nodded. But he still looked annoyed. Alessa was fairly certain she recognized him. And she definitely recognized the name. Though she was also certain she'd never worked with him directly.

""Can't fly it?"" Another person, an Aquian, asked. Alessa's eyebrow rose as she saw them. They were a rare species for Mars, which was kind of short on water. But she saw the familiar bulge of hydrating packs under his arms.

""You check weather lately?"" Another asked before the woman could answer. She was clearly irked by them beating her to the answer. But she quickly controlled her expression. But Alessa noticed it.

Suddenly phones and watches were being raised and looked at. Alessa simply listened to Lucky in her ear.

""Seventy three percent chance of Martian sandstorm overtaking Karzok crater in the next three days."" Lucky informed her.

""As you're all learning."" The business woman said with another fake smile. ""The weather prediction from our satellites has a high likelihood of a sandstorm in the area. Nothing major. But high enough that flights would have to be orbital. And you all know how expensive those are. Hiring you to transport over land requires less paperwork, and less money. While risking normal hover-trucks instead of flying a ship through a sandstorm.""

They all nodded. With Gates making most travel easy and quick, most other forms of NON-public transit had gotten prohibitively expensive. And a Martian sandstorm would test even the best mechanical and enchantment based vehicles. But hover-trucks would have no issue going up the mountain and, ideally, avoiding the storm. Or at least avoiding MOST of the storm. They would inevitably end up in it once they neared Karzok.

""And who are these competing companies?"" Alessa asked drawing everyone's attention. It was already odd that a pharmaceutical company was hiring a bunch of mercenaries for an escort job. But it was downright concerning that they expected some kind of violent interference.

Ms. Espejo nodded with barely concealed discomfort.

""The company's biggest competitors are Pfizer-Mars, and J.J.&B."" She said.

The group visibly looked confused. Alessa simply stared at the woman. Neither of those companies had any reason to mess with Poecel, which was a Mars only research group that worked WITH those other companies more often than not.

Espejo got the message from Alessa's blank stare.

""But we expect interference from C.M.M.C."" She said quickly.

Immediately the group of mercenaries began talking amongst themselves. A few of them even stood up and looked as though they were considering leaving.

""Why?"" Alessa asked loudly and firmly. ""Why would THEY... get involved in a local company moving something across the planet?""

The murmur quieted.

""You don't have to tell us what the cargo is. But at least give us an idea of WHY... the C.M.M.C. would even pay this any attention."" She continued.

The business woman chewed her lip for a moment.

Then she spoke.

""We have... or the company has... discovered a source of... material... that is capable of being integrated into certain medications that they believe can... HELP... alleviate, and potentially cure, certain magic based sicknesses and defects."" She answered hesitantly. ""I can't tell you any more than that.""

They'd all gone silent.

There were only a handful of conditions that could fall into that category. Centuries of technological and magical innovation, which expanded with each universe brought into the fold, had practically eliminated the concept of INCURABLE medical conditions.

But the few that still did exist were.... brutal. And anyone, scientist or mage, who discovered a cure for them would be an overnight billionaire, if not trillionaire, and a multiverse hero to boot.

If the cargo was really what the woman said, and if it really ended up being useful for that purpose....

Almost as one every mercenary's eyes widened as the importance of the cargo in question dawned on them.

Alessa considered that. Then stood up tall and faced Espejo

""I'll be team lead."" She said. ""But we're re-negotiating my pay.""

And just like that, the whole mercenary group exploded into argument.",3,1754428176.0,GATEhouse,2,1.0,False

Alessa jogged as she exited the blue tram. As she did she slurped the last bit of nutrient swill from a packet she'd bought from the tram's dispenser and tossed it absently into a recycler on one of the street corners.

""E.T.A.?"" She asked her AI.

""At current rate you will arrive with two minutes to spare."" Lucky responded from her earring.

Alessa picked up her pace. She preferred to be early, and two minutes was not her idea of being such.

Nobody paid her any mind as she jogged. A sword over her shoulder and a revolver on her hip were nothing to gawk at. Weapons were the norm these days. Not like when she'd first crossed over to this universe.

Back then the Earth-based government that would eventually form E.M.A.G. had been very strict about who could and couldn't CARRY weapons or use magic in public.

But between the ten or so new universes that had been discovered and integrated (with varying levels of success, as her world showed), the different species and cultures of peoples, and the new beasts and monsters accompanying them, the government had effectively given up on trying to STOP people from being armed. Instead they'd adopted the same policy that most Earth firearm stores had had for centuries. And after a few decades had even implemented the ""First to draw, first to fall"" law, along with intensifying punishment for violent criminals.

It wasn't perfect. But Alessa's weapons and armor were, if anything, light compared to some of the people she passed on the street.

A pair of half-orcs, brothers if she had to guess, were conversing with a dwarf and a Hisstian as they drank coffee. The half-orcs both had what appeared to be customized shotguns slung on their backs. The dwarf had his familial axe on his belt. And while she couldn't tell, she was fairly certain the snake-like Hisstian had some kind of S.M.G. under his coat.

Lucky calculated what he suspected each one of being and notated it for her in case she needed the info during a fight. Not that she would.

And only a few yards away a pair of M-Sec officers were chatting with the vendor of the hot dog cart on the corner, completely uncaring of the armed group nearby.

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal smoothie mug shoudl possess qualities that enhance both the enjoyment of the smoothie itself and the overall user experience. Several technical specifications contribute to achieving this goal.

**Insulation Performance:** Insulation is paramount for maintaining the optimal temperature of your smoothie. A good mug should keep your cold smoothie cold for several hours, even in a warm environment. Double-walled vacuum insulation is the gold standard, frequently enough utilizing stainless steel to minimize heat transfer. Look for mugs that boast specific temperature retention times, such as ""keeps cold for up to 12-24 hours."" the effectiveness of the insulation also depends on the tightness of the lid seal,preventing air from affecting the temperature.

**Material Durability and Safety:** The materials used in a smoothie mug are critical for both durability and safety. High-quality stainless steel (e.g., 18/8 or 304 grade) is a popular choice for its robustness, resistance to corrosion, and lack of chemical leaching. Plastic mugs, if chosen, should be BPA-free and made from food-grade materials. Glass mugs offer purity of taste but are more susceptible to breakage. Consider the overall construction of the mug, including the handle (if any) and the base, to ensure long-term durability.

**Lid Design and Leak Resistance:** The lid is a crucial component of any smoothie mug, particularly for on-the-go use. A well-designed lid should be leak-resistant, easy to open and close, and provide a comfortable drinking experience. Screw-on lids with silicone seals are generally more reliable than snap-on lids. Look for lids with built-in straws or drinking spouts that are also easy to clean. Vent holes can definitely help regulate pressure and prevent spills when opening.

**Size and Capacity:** Smoothie mugs come in various sizes, ranging from compact 12-ounce options to larger 32-ounce containers. The ideal size depends on your individual preferences and smoothie consumption habits. Consider how frequently you make smoothies and whether you prefer to drink them in one sitting or sip them throughout the day. Larger mugs are suitable for individuals who make large batch smoothies or use them for longer periods. Smaller mugs are more portable and manageable for fast consumption.**Ease of Cleaning:** Cleaning a smoothie mug should be a straightforward process. Mugs with wide mouths are easier to scrub and rinse than those with narrow openings. Dishwasher-safe mugs offer the ultimate convenience, but it's essential to check the manufacturer's instructions to ensure that both the mug and the lid are compatible with dishwasher cleaning. Mugs with removable components, such as straws and seals, are also easier to clean thoroughly.

**Grip and Handling:** The ergonomics of a smoothie mug will affect how comfortable it is indeed to hold and carry, particularly when it's full. Mugs with textured surfaces or built-in handles provide a more secure grip. Consider the overall weight of the mug when full, as a heavy mug can become cumbersome to carry around for extended periods. The mug's diameter should also be comfortable to hold, especially for individuals with smaller hands.

## FAQs Section

**Can I put my smoothie mug in the freezer?**
While some stainless-steel mugs are freezer-safe, it's generally not recommended. Freezing liquids expand, and this could perhaps damage the insulation or the seals of the mug, especially if it's filled to the brim. It is indeed best to chill your smoothie ingredients separately or use ice in the smoothie itself.

**How do I clean my smoothie mug to prevent residue buildup?**
Rinse your smoothie mug immediately after each use to prevent residue from hardening.For thorough cleaning, use warm soapy water and a bottle brush to scrub all interior surfaces, paying special attention to the crevices and seals.If your mug is dishwasher-safe, you can also place it in the dishwasher for a more convenient cleaning option. For stubborn stains or odors, try using a mixture of baking soda and water.

**what types of smoothies work best in these mugs?**
Virtually any type of smoothie works well in these mugs. Whether you prefer green smoothies, fruit smoothies, protein shakes, or even frozen coffee drinks, the insulated design will help maintain the temperature and consistency. However, highly fibrous smoothies might require a wider straw or spout to ensure easy drinking.

**Are stainless steel smoothie mugs better than plastic ones?**
Stainless steel and plastic smoothie mugs both have their pros and cons. Stainless steel mugs generally offer better insulation, durability, and resistance to odors and stains. They are also considered a more sustainable option. Plastic mugs are typically lighter and less expensive, but may not provide the same level of insulation or longevity. Choose based on your priorities and budget.

1milcgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1milcgu/the_inheritance_of_castle_nyvahn_part_3/,The Inheritance of Castle Nyvahn (Part 3),"**Part 3: Rotgrund**

I woke the next day slowly, the kind of slow where your body registers the cold before your mind fully remembers where you are.

The stone beneath me was unforgiving. I’d fallen asleep at the desk: head down on an open notebook, neck twisted at an awkward angle, a thin throw blanket pulled over my shoulders doing little against the castle’s bone-deep chill. The fire in the study had long since died to ash. Outside, the light had turned pale and gray. Morning.

My hands felt stiff. I flexed my fingers, cracking the knuckles, and sat up. A dream clung to me like frost, blurry and soft around the edges. I dreamed of the village, not how it was now, but how it used to be. Or maybe how I wanted it to be. Faces I almost recognized, somehow. In the dream, I saw something strange in the distance. In the direction of the castle stood an unforgiving blackness stretching up to the heavens. And somewhere in the dream, the scent of smoke and pine. It left a residue behind, like something unfinished.

I got up and moved around the study, shaking off the cold. The stone floor stole warmth from my feet through my socks. I stepped back into my boots, pulled my coat tighter, and grabbed my notebook off the desk. The pages were smudged from where I’d been leaning on them in my sleep. Notes about the genealogy chart. Transcriptions from the journal I found.

I left the study, making my way through the winding halls. The silence was different now. Still heavy, still watchful, but familiar. Like the way an old cathedral settles into your bones the longer you stay inside it. I passed by a dusty mirror and caught my reflection; my eyes were sunken from lack of sleep, my hair a mess. I looked like someone playing dress-up in someone else’s inheritance.

Eventually, I made my way to the great hall. The morning light filtered in through high windows, catching on the swirling dust in the air. It lit up the old furniture, the tarnished gold frames of the ancestral portraits, the faded crest carved into the stone above the hearth. And there, at the wooden table near the entrance, stood Ingrid.

She was setting down a basket, covered with cloth and steaming faintly. Her head turned slightly as I entered, and she smiled.

“Sorry for barging in,” she said. “You left the door unlocked and I thought you might be hungry. I figured you’d forget to eat.”

“Probably,” I admitted, scratching the back of my neck. “You didn’t have to come all the way up here, though.”

She shrugged, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. “Didn’t mind. Besides, it’s not every day I get to enter into a cursed castle.”

I gave her a look. “You really think it’s cursed?”

Ingrid tilted her head. “Not cursed. Just… old.”

I sat down at the table as she unpacked the food—bread, cheese, sliced apples, and smoked fish. There was even a thermos of coffee, still warm. The smell alone made me realize how hungry I was.

We ate in silence at first, the clink of metal on wood echoing faintly in the vast hall. For a moment, the castle felt less ominous—just ancient and tired, not malevolent. Ingrid had a calming presence. She didn’t fill the silence unnecessarily, but she didn’t avoid it either. It made it easier to think.

“I found something strange yesterday,” I said between bites. “A name. Alaric. It was in an old ledger, and again in a hidden journal. Sound familiar?”

Ingrid frowned slightly. “Alaric… maybe. I feel like I’ve heard it. Maybe someone my grandmother mentioned? It’s not a common name, that’s for sure.”

“It stood out,” I said. “Especially because it’s written next to… other things. Offerings. Names.”

“Like sacrifices?” she asked, her voice lowered slightly.

“Maybe,” I said. “The ledger didn’t explain. Just listed the names. No notes. Just… dates, ages, names. Alaric was the last one. No date or age to go with it.”

Her face had gone a little pale. “That’s unsettling.”

I nodded, thinking back to the way the ink looked on that page. Like the writer had scrawled it in a rush and then walked away forever.

After a moment, Ingrid spoke again. “Do you want help? With all of this? Exploring, documenting, whatever it is you’re doing.”

I looked at her. There was no trace of hesitation in her face. Just quiet curiosity. Something steady.

“Yeah,” I said. “Actually, I’d really appreciate it.”

She smiled again, brighter this time. “Good. I brought a flashlight too.”

We finished eating and gathered our things: my notebook and camera, her flashlight. The castle had so many halls I hadn’t touched, rooms that felt like they folded in on themselves. But the one place that had been gnawing at the edge of my thoughts since last night was the grove. *Rotgrund*, marked in red on that old map.

We left through the side entrance, the gravel crunching beneath our boots. The air outside was colder than I remembered, sharper. The forest stretched ahead, vast and unmoving, waiting.

“Not many folks go this far south anymore,” she said, ducking beneath a low branch. “Hunting ground’s been sparse for years. My grandfather said it used to be full of elk and boar. Now it’s mostly trees and silence.”

“Silence seems to be the theme around here,” I said. “Even the castle feels… paused.”

She shot me a look. “You felt that too?”

I nodded. “Yeah. Like something’s waiting to start again.”

We walked for a while in companionable quiet, boots crunching through old snow and patches of brown pine needles. The sun filtered through the canopy above in pale shafts, glinting off frost-laced branches. The cold had a different edge here. Not sharp, but heavier, like a hand pressed lightly to your chest.

Eventually, the old carriage trail we’d been following dwindled into a mossy path barely wider than our boots. Ingrid slowed, glancing around.

“This is farther than I’ve ever been out here,” she admitted. “I mean, the hunters talk about the southern woods, but mostly in that vague, spooky ‘don’t-go-there’ way.”

“Folklore territory,” I said. “Always the best place to start fieldwork.”

She snorted. “You call this fieldwork?”

“I call it whatever helps me not think about how creepy this place is.”

Her mouth quirked into a smile. “Fair.”

I pulled the map from my coat pocket, the one I’d found in the study. The hand-drawn one marked with the name *Rotgrund*. The ink was faded, but the outline of the castle and its grounds was clear enough. The southern grove was maybe a mile from the keep, tucked beyond a slope and marked with a single red circle. Someone had clearly thought it important. Or dangerous.

“Here,” I said, tapping the page. “It’s supposed to be in this direction.”

We veered off the trail, pushing through underbrush and dead ferns. The land dipped slightly, and the light grew stranger with each step. Not darker exactly, but duller. Flattened. Like the air had thickened and was muting everything around us. Even the snow looked less white.

“I don’t think the trees like us,” Ingrid murmured.

I glanced at her.

“They’re leaning,” she said. “See it? Like they’re trying to crowd us out.”

She was right. The pines around us stood at faint but unmistakable angles, all sloping just slightly inward toward the path we were walking. Like a funnel. Or a throat.

I cleared mine and said, “Do you believe in any of the old stuff?”

She didn’t answer immediately.

“My grandmother used to,” she said after a while. “She’d leave food out on the winter solstice. Bits of bread and honey. Told me the forest spirit needed reminding that we were still thankful. That if we stopped remembering, they’d stop protecting us.”

“And start… what? Punishing?”

“Something like that,” she said. “Or maybe just forgetting we exist.”

I folded the map and tucked it away. “You said the village stopped being prosperous around seventy years ago. You think those two things are connected?”

She shrugged. “Maybe. Or maybe time just moves on. Maybe the world gets tired of places like this.”

We crested a ridge, the forest opening slightly beyond. I could feel it before I saw it, a subtle shift in pressure, like the atmosphere itself dipped. The wind stopped moving. My ears popped.

“Feel that?” I asked.

Ingrid nodded. “We’re close.”

The trees ahead grew further apart, the ground between them cleared of most underbrush. A clearing, unmistakably round, waited just beyond the last of the frost-covered trunks.

Something in both of us hesitated at the edge, a quiet agreement not to speak until we were ready. I looked over at her, and she looked back. Her breath came slower now, deliberate.

“You sure?” I asked.

“Not remotely,” she said. “But if you’re walking in, I’m walking with you.”

We stepped forward.

The trees fell away like pulled curtains, revealing the clearing all at once. It was circular, almost perfectly so, with no natural randomness to its shape. The boundary of the grove was marked by stone arches. Seven of them, each spaced evenly around the edge, like the frame of a clock. Moss covered their faces, and faint carvings peeked through the lichen: lines, spirals, and crude shapes I couldn’t immediately interpret.

But what struck me first wasn’t the structure. It was the temperature.

The air here was colder. Sharply so. The breath I exhaled misted thicker, slower. My fingertips ached inside my gloves. It wasn’t just a dip in degrees. It was an ancient, unmoving chill, like the heat of the world didn’t reach this place.

“God,” Ingrid muttered beside me. “It’s like stepping into a tomb.”

I said nothing, too focused on what stood at the center.

It rose from the old firepit. Six feet tall, maybe more, shaped like a figure but clearly not human. A totem, formed of blackened roots twisted together like a woven skeleton. Bones — bird, deer, small mammal — were woven into the rootwork, and crow feathers hung from its limbs like tattered sleeves. At the top sat the skull of a buck, its eye sockets hollow, its antlers cracked and asymmetrical. One of them curled backward like a hook, the other split in two.

I moved slowly toward it, my breath catching in my throat. The totem didn’t radiate anything menacing, not exactly, but it had weight. It held the space. Like it was the oldest thing here, and the trees had grown around it out of respect. Or fear.

I pulled out my camera and took several pictures from different angles, stepping lightly around the firepit. The earth here was blackened, not by ash — but by something older. The soil looked burnt, yet not fresh. Like it had been marked centuries ago and never healed.

“What is this?” I asked, my voice quieter than I intended.

Ingrid’s eyes were fixed on the totem. “An offering post. Or what’s left of one.”

“You’ve seen something like this before?”

“Not here. But... there are smaller ones near the village. Hidden in old sheds, behind barns. The elders always clean them up before the festivals. I didn’t think any were left this intact.”

She took a step forward, tilting her head. “This is... old. Pre-Christian. Maybe even older than that.”

“And the antlers?” I asked. “Is that symbolic?”

She nodded slowly. “The forest god. That’s what my grandmother called it. A protector, but not a kind one. People used to leave rice, fruit, fish. Then livestock. Then…”

She trailed off.

“Then people,” I finished for her.

She looked at me, eyes heavy. “It was never official. No one admitted it. But there are old stories. Disappearances that didn’t raise alarms. Sacrifices disguised as misfortune.”

“And you think this god actually… did something? Blessed the land?”

Ingrid shrugged. 

I turned back to the totem. A faint hum seemed to hang in the air around it. Not a sound, but a feeling. Like my bones were vibrating, just slightly. I didn’t want to believe in forest gods or rituals, but this thing... it didn’t feel symbolic. It felt present.

“Has anyone come out here before?” I asked.

“Probably your ancestors,” she said. “Maybe the elders too, but I doubt that. ”

I was about to ask more when something shifted at the edge of my vision. I turned toward the trees. Nothing there. Just dense forest, branches dusted in frost, unmoving.

Then I saw it. Half-hidden behind a pine trunk, large and low to the ground. A shape, dark and heavy, vaguely ursine in silhouette. Not moving. Just... there. Watching.

A breath caught in my throat.

Then something else stepped into view beside it, humanoid and motionless. I couldn’t make out its features, only the impression of limbs and a head crowned with something branching. Antlers. Or horns.

“Ingrid,” I said, my voice barely audible. “Don’t look directly. But there’s something in the trees.”

Her body tensed immediately. I saw her eyes shift in the direction I’d indicated, slow and cautious.

“I see it,” she whispered. “Both of them.”

“We’re leaving.”

We didn’t run. That would’ve felt like provocation. Instead, we turned slowly, deliberately, and began walking back the way we came. Back toward the castle.

The grove stayed silent behind us. I didn’t hear movement, but I felt it. The figures pacing just out of view, staying behind the trees, always at the edge of sight. They weren’t chasing. They were escorting. 

The cold didn’t leave us, even as we re-entered the deeper woods. It followed. We didn’t speak until we crossed through the rusted iron gate of the castle grounds. Only then did Ingrid exhale and mutter, “What the hell was that?”

“I don’t know,” I said, trying to sound level, but I knew I was pale. My hands still trembled. “But they followed us. I could feel them.”

“I saw them. That... thing next to the bear. Did it have antlers?”

“Yeah,” I said. “Or branches. Or both.”

We walked briskly back inside the manor. The side-door groaned shut behind us like it was relieved. I locked it this time, for no real reason other than to feel like I’d done something.

Ingrid collapsed onto the faded couch in the main hall and pulled her knees up, hugging them tightly. I took the armchair across from her. The silence between us wasn’t awkward, just heavy.

“I’ve never seen anything like that,” she said after a while. “I used to go hiking all around the forest bordering the village when I was younger. I thought I knew it.”

“You think it was the old god?” I asked.

She was quiet for a long moment.

“I don’t know. But something was there. And it saw us. Watched us. Like we weren’t supposed to be there.”

I nodded, rubbing my eyes. “There’s something about this place. The more I learn, the more I feel like I’m digging into something I’m not meant to.”

She gave me a faint, tired smile. “Isn’t that your job.”

“Yeah, but the past doesn’t usually stare back like that.”

That got a small laugh out of her, despite everything. “Fair enough.”

We sat there for a while, letting the fear settle. The cold still clung to us, even inside.

Eventually, she asked, “Do you ever think about staying? Here, I mean.”

“In the manor?” I blinked. “God, no. The walls groan louder than my joints.”

“I meant the village.”

I looked at her. “Why?”

“I don’t know.” She shrugged. “You seem like you belong here more than you think.”

“That’s ominous.”

She laughed. “I mean it. You don’t feel like an outsider.”

“I’m not sure if that’s a compliment or a warning,” I replied, giving her a sideways glance. “What about you? Ever think of leaving?”

“All the time,” she said, more quickly than I expected. “When I was younger, I thought I’d leave. Study medicine, maybe. See the world. Maybe even have a family one day. I used to daydream about big cities. Stockholm, Berlin, anywhere that wasn’t here. I still do”

“And what stopped you from leaving?”

She looked down, her fingers tracing the rim of her mug. “My grandma. She raised me, after my parents died. She’s tough, but she’s getting older. I couldn’t just leave her to run the inn by herself. And the truth is…” She paused, then met my eyes. “The village gets under your skin. Even when it’s quiet. Even when it feels like nothing happens here anymore. There’s something about the rhythm of it. The people. The land. It pulls at you.”

I nodded slowly. “That sounds like both a comfort and a trap.”

“Yeah,” she said, almost in a whisper. “Exactly.”

Before I could reply, we both jumped at the sudden knock at the front door.

I stood, heart thudding again, and glanced at her. She was already on her feet, moving cautiously toward the door. I followed, slower. She opened it carefully.

Outside stood a young couple, bundled in light jackets, their cheeks red from the walk up the hill. The woman’s hands were resting over her stomach in a protective, unconscious way. The man gave Ingrid a warm smile.

“Ingrid!” the woman said. “We came to the inn looking for you, but your grandmother said you were up here.”

“Greta,” Ingrid said, surprised, then embraced her. “And Olaf, what are you two doing here?”

“We wanted to tell you the news in person.” Greta beamed, her eyes wet with excitement. She looked between us and gently patted her belly.

Ingrid gasped. “You’re pregnant?”

Greta nodded. “We just found out earlier today. We’re still early, but… it’s real.”

Olaf added with a soft smile, “We haven’t had something like this in the village for a long time.”

I ushered them into the warmth of the main hall. Greta and Olaf settled in on the same old couch Ingrid had been curled up on. Ingrid sat beside them. I stood by the fireplace, still letting the surprise settle in.

“A child,” Ingrid said, still smiling. “This is huge.”

“It is,” Greta said. “You know what it means.”

I raised an eyebrow. “What does it mean?”

Greta turned to me. “You’re not from here, are you?”

“No. Researcher. Historian. Visiting.”

She nodded. “Well, then... you probably haven’t heard. The village used to be full. Families with five, six kids. Schools with dozens of students. Then, about seventy years ago, it started to change. Slowly at first. Crops began failing, livestock got sick, and worst of all—”

“People stopped having children,” Olaf finished. “Most did, not all. And fewer still survived.”

“The village elders say we lost the favor of the forest,” Greta continued. “That we angered the old god.”

“Wait,” I said. “You mean the same god…the one we were talking about earlier?”

Ingrid nodded slowly. “Yeah. That one.”

Greta’s hand drifted to her stomach again. “But this... this pregnancy feels like a gift. A sign. Maybe we’re in its good graces again.”

I felt a chill crawl down my spine at her phrasing. “You really believe that?”

She looked at me. Calm. Certain. “Yes. So does most of the village.”

We talked for a while longer. Ingrid caught up with them, laughing a little, smiling more than I’d seen her in the last few days. Despite the strange tension earlier, the air now was light, hopeful. 

Eventually, Olaf and Greta said their goodbyes and left, walking arm in arm into the misty evening light.

Ingrid turned to me as the door closed behind them. “You okay?”

“I’m not sure,” I admitted. 

She looked at me, quiet for a moment. “You said your father was from here, right?”

“Supposedly.”

She stood and slipped on her coat, brushing a few stray pine needles from the hem. 

“Anyway,” she said, shouldering her bag, “I should get back before it gets too dark. My grandma starts worrying if I’m not back before dinner.”

“Right,” I said, standing too. “Thanks for today. For coming out here.”

“Of course.” She paused near the door, one hand on the frame. “You’ll be okay here tonight?”

“I’ll be fine,” I said, even if I wasn’t entirely sure.

She smiled and gave a small wave as she stepped through the door, her boots crunching softly over the frost outside. The wind had picked up again, thin and sharp. Within seconds, she was gone.

I stood in the silence for a moment longer, then returned to the study. The fire had gone down to embers, and the light outside was draining fast. I should’ve felt safe, or at least calm. But instead, I felt the castle shift around me again. Not physically, but subtly. Like it was taking a slow breath now that I was alone.

I returned to my notes.

1milcay,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1milcay/when_hard_work_doesnt_matter_but_friendships_do/,"When hard work doesn’t matter, but friendships do","A bit of a long read but late night musings or maybe just a vent…just needed to organize my thoughts, let this one out before I move on to the next chapter of my life. 

So here goes nothing…

Nine years ago, I joined my current (now former) workplace straight out of university. My department at the time, was merged with another unit. There was a main head overseeing both departments and a supervisor dedicated to ours.

When I joined, the supervisor was on extended leave. I shared an office with two other girls, one who joined a year before me, and the other two years prior. We got along well and things felt promising.

Eventually, the supervisor returned, and everything continued as normal. Over time, though, it became clear that one of my colleagues (let’s call her Coaster) wasn’t exactly the hardest worker. She was always reclining in her chair, chatting away, barely doing the minimum but she had an incredibly tight relationship with the supervisor. And that relationship seemed to shield her from any consequences. She frequently declined tasks, even important ones and never seemed to face pushback.

Eventually, the other original colleague left, and a new teammate joined us, someone I had known back in high school, who turned out to be extremely competent and also well-liked by other departments.

Meanwhile, I had grown to truly love the job. I was being entrusted with major projects, regularly invited to high-level meetings, and even got sent to represent the company at conferences and training sessions. My work was getting company-wide recognition, and I was thriving.

Then came the twist.

After several years and one company-wide shake-up, including the passing of our CEO and the hiring of a new one who had little industry knowledge, the supervisor seized the moment. She requested that our department be split off officially… and shortly after, secretly offered Coaster a promotion to supervisor. We only found this out much later, but she apparently “took six months to think about it,” and then accepted.

Now promoted, Coaster didn’t change. She continued to come in late, spent the first hour of her day drinking coffee and gossiping with the new department head (her longtime ally), and still avoided any task that required real effort, especially those requiring her to speak publicly or be held accountable. Those responsibilities? They all fell to me. Either the head of department asked me to take them on, or others requested me by name.

I didn’t mind at first. I genuinely liked what I did. But it got exhausting, especially watching her collect the perks. She’d attend overseas trips she barely contributed to, while I stayed behind managing department queries and producing results in a day or two… while she took weeks, even months.

Eventually, my more recent colleague left for a new department, and our head fell seriously ill. It was just me and Coaster. That’s when the imbalance became undeniable.

I was doing the actual supervisory work, even to the point of taking the lead, with her in the room, when conducting interviews for potential hires ( alongside HR). Meanwhile, she was reaping the titles, benefits, and travel opportunities and still showing visible bitterness when, for example, I got pregnant and a coworker congratulated me. She barely even acknowledged it.

Eventually, I had enough. I resigned but not before having the courtesy to tell her first. Her response was salty and confrontational. I stayed professional, handed my resignation to HR, and left quietly. The CEO, who by then had been replaced with yet another new person and was much more knowledgeable and had actually worked in the company for over a decade prior to applying and being appointed, tried to convince me to stay with a raise but it wasn’t nearly enough to make up for what had become a toxic dynamic. This company had a track record of losing good employees by refusing to deal with problematic ones and they were repeating the same cycle.

I still think back sometimes. I loved the job itself, but a combination of favoritism, complacency, and lack of meritocracy made it impossible to keep going. Even our former head the one who fell ill, recently broke down and said she wished I hadn’t left. And while I appreciated it… I can’t help but think: wasn’t she part of the reason it got to this point?

I’ve realized that some workplaces treat promotion like a queue, as if whoever’s been around the longest deserves it first, regardless of actual competence. It’s like rewarding someone just for waiting, not for working.

When HR asked me during my exit interview if I thought I should’ve been promoted, I told them something that still rings true today. 

A promotion should never be something you ask for, it should be something that is earned and given in recognition of your work. If it has to be begged for, it’s already meaningless.

Or, as the saying goes:

My idea for the setup was going to be buy an inverter like this:  https://a.co/d/0MWIKvy

I currently have 200ah of lithium and would buy more. Probably 600ah total. 

My goal would be to run the heater occasionally. I’m in Texas so winters are usually mild. I would also want to run coffee makers, TV for the kids or if theirs a sporting event on, star link, etc… 

How I was planning on setting this up would be keep my current lithium battery in place connected to camper how it normally is. Setup the inverter listed above with 400ah-600ah of additional batteries (completely seperate from main battery) and then just plug the camper directly into the inverter with an extension cord/dogbone.

Would this work? If so could I instead just have one battery bank of multiple seperate batteries all hooked up to my current converter and just add the inverter to the setup?

Staff searches after wristband exchange are nice and low grade- completely different story once you have the bracelet!

The Sziget beach is closed for the festival duration due to previous storms causing high waters and being unsafe- this could have been communicated somehow.

Me and my friend went out on the bridge and I figured I’ve forgotten my wallet. We returned after like 10m and ask the security kindly if we can go grab a wallet since we just left and didn’t even crossed the bridge yet. The young guy on his phone stated he “didn’t see” us  (though we passed like 3 securities a minute ago) and we had to go through security again loosing 30 minutes. At the security they wanted to throw away my water bottle so I had to argue I actually came into festival with it already.

After coming back to the island the second time (we were in the city and also did groceries) my pass wasn’t okay because the picture of ID wasn’t closed up but rotated. The lady who checked it and the supervisor weren’t able to do anything so they sent me back to wristband exchange where the queues were awful. I was like no fqn way and went to ticket information where I’ve got the issue resolved. This shouldn’t have been a thing I had to deal with myself imo and should have been resolved at the scanning desk.

Once I resolved the wristband issue they took away my instant coffee due to the glass container. It irritates me that glass and metal objects aren’t stated in prohibited items list but I get it. I agreed on living it there coming back with the plastic container. So I walk to the camp, found a plastic bag and get back to the securities and the coffee was gone.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **New York Mets vs. Cleveland Guardians: A Tale of Two Teams (and One Very Tired Pitcher)**

The New York Mets (-196) stride into Citi Field as favorites against the Cleveland Guardians (56-55), a team that’s chasing wildcards like a caffeinated squirrel chasing a coffee cup. Let’s break this down with the precision of a MLB umpire and the humor of a concession stand comedian.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Mets Are the Smart Money

The Mets’ implied probability of winning this game? A solid **66.2%** (thanks to those -196 odds). For context, that’s about the same chance your Uncle Bob has of remembering to water his plants while on vacation. The Guardians, at +240, imply a **29.4%** chance—roughly the odds of me finishing this article without eating a snack.

Statistically, the Mets dominate. Their offense (4.4 runs/game, 15th in MLB) outpaces Cleveland’s anemic 3.9 runs/game (26th). Clay Holmes, the Mets’ starting pitcher, is a strikeout artist with a 3.45 ERA and 91 Ks in 117 innings. He’s the difference between a five-star chef and the Guardians’ Logan Allen, whose 4.06 ERA and 1.362 WHIP make him more of a “microwave dinner” pitcher—quick, unreliable, and likely to leave a mess.

The total is set at 8.5 runs, with the Over/Under hovering around 50-50. Given Holmes’ ability to limit damage and the Guardians’ porous lineup, though, this game might end up looking like a budget-friendly family dinner: *undercooked and underwhelming*.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Struggles, and Wildcard Dreams

The Mets are coming off a **12-4 drubbing by the Giants**, a loss so惨 that even their fans are questioning whether “amazin’” is a code word for “embarrassing.” Still, their core remains intact: Francisco Lindor (21 HRs, 64 RBI), Pete Alonso, and Juan Soto form a trio that could triple as a reality TV show about power hitters with trust i

1mil569,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1mil569/chances_of_becoming_a_manager_in_the_given/,Chances of becoming a manager in the given circumstances,"As a starting statement, it might get long and tricky. Here we go:

I've been working for the past 2 years in a 3 years old consultancy firm. The company itself was founded by two people that have previously worked for our current main competitor, one as middle management with more than 15y XP, the other one as an IC with somewhere next to 8y XP. I've personally worked for some years as well within our competitor's structure as an exec. assistant for C-level management. 

The current setup happened by chance - I've opted out from my previous employer and they simply just let me go, no NDA, no no-compete clause, nothing. They saw me as nothing more than a wonder kid of a workhorse, while I on the other hand was seeing in those last months a 9yo relationship end because of my abussive work ethic. By one random Monday, when they just dropped on us in a 10AM townhall that they've ""redesigned"" the whole organsation chart based on a mountain trip (and visionary future sights, maybe?), I just felt an enormous rupture within and I was done by Friday. They probably thought I just snapped because of my personal issues and the orange had its final squeeze.

After a brief sabbatical of 3 months, I've stumbled by chance in this current setup since we all knew one another mostly by names and I decided to start from the basics of it, not using any of my skills and understandings of how such business performs that I've developed as an EA.

That casual IC role has lasted for precisely 2 weeks, since the founder that had no previous management roles was acting CEO and the senior one was rather focused on securing clients, which meant basically from the get go that there wasn't any clarity regarding roles, responsabilities, hierarchies and so on. 

I could not help myself after week 2 to keep it low-profile anymore since I saw my colleagues struggling with some of the most basic responsabilities, and I've naturally built a fast paced and intermediate structure that has allowed us within this timeframe to succesfully triple our headcount and almost 10x our number of active projects. I've had two major inner objectives that emerged and simply powerhoused me into working 60 hours a week, 6 and even 7 out of 7 days - burning our main competitor to the ground by outsmarting them with the vast know-how they've allowed to slip-out through me and building for myself a long and prosperous career.

If you haven't guessed it by now, the problem itself is so obvious by its own stupidity. I'm being held down by one of the founding fathers, the little guy.

I've built from scratch anything you could think of for a company to improve their chances of success - organizational chart, OKRs objective structure, budgeting, work flows, new business support system that secures any project brought on our table, recruitment, onboarding, I've started an organisational development project, I've started a digitalization project that will save hours spent on recurrent tasks, I've been ordering laptops, coffee, mounting desks and chairs, I've organised several out-of-the-office cohesion activities... I've been an ace of all trades and a master of none, by myself, with no other compensation than my monthly salary. And I've kept on grinding towards my career as future COO, having in mind this is the promise land agreed in my 2024 EOY assesment with the big guy.

There's a saying that roughly translates into ""Till you meet God, you'll be devoured by all the saints"". The little guy would not have any of it. I've been constantly brought down, all my doings are belittled, nothing ever seems to be good enough between my doings and his incoherent thoughts that he never brings to fruition. He's been told to act as a team coordinator where he should supervise all our active projects and not only he fails as one, he keeps on keeping me at bay from taking more responsability out of his hands. He thrives with discretionary power that the big guy does not ammend enough. So we've come to a halt. After lots of backs and forths between myself and the little guy in the last 6 months, some of them caused by the mere fact that meanwhile the big guy stepped down as CEO and he found himself as no. 2 in a company he'd let us constantly to believe he'll always be no. 1, I've felt a similar rupture to the one that made me quit from my previous employer and I decided to have a final duel. I've said my piece of mind, he said his, and he finally made peace with it and alas, the little guy stated it - ""I want you to put COO in your e-mail signature from now on. Consider it done.""

Oh my. Thanks, I guess? I've let him understand the reality of it in the following seconds - I don't need the title of it, nor the pay bump at this particular moment. I firstly want the authority and responsability that the title provides. So I went home, I got excited and I immediately started building my platform around it. What resources I need as a headcount was the first and last of it, unfortunately, as I briefly stated during our talk that in the following months I'll only need one hire.

What would Jesus do? But of course he'd go and launch a similar job description to our 3rd party recruiting agency behind my back, with some of the responsabilities others that I have envisioned in our final duel.

Oh boy, here we go again. Mambo no. 2. 

- Why would you do that regarding an individual I personally want to recruit? 
- Because it's not yours to decide, I'll be managing him.

Insert Dexter shocked meme.

- My beautiful boy. Do you actually want me as COO? Should we discuss what the acronym means? You've said it word by word.
- What I meant was something similar of COO.
- More like your secretary, you mean?

And there it was. The final silence between me and the little guy. So yeah, I've snapped and I've written my piece of mind towards the big guy, detailing more or less a proper departure in steps.

He went ballistic, did not want to hear any of it and summoned me to an 1on1 the following day, on a Sunday, and we've talked for several hours on all the matters at hand - my development ideas, his, our little guy's shortcomings and all. It wasn't friendly at all regarding the little guy - I was led to believe there might be a squeeze out involved in the near future if he does not get his game straight (keep in mind he's piling mismanagement debt by not properly handling situations below him and the CEO is well aware since he's covering this ""image debt"" in front of most of our clients). I didn't want to be brought back on track, tbh, however I guess would've said straight no to the meeting request if I didn't have the slightest of hope that this burning ship can be properly sailed towards blue oceans of revenue and professional recognition. And the promise land has been once again placed on the negotiation table, along a deal sweetener - there will be equity involved in this matter, as the big guy considered it proper to offer.

Now. I can both be COO and have equity in the company for which I passionately work and through which I can fulfill a professional vendetta as well? My, my, I was not expecting that. Like for real. I wasn't ready for that kind of a discussion, so I've stated it - Thanks for this opportunity, I wanna say that I sincerely wasn't expecting to talk any kind of numbers and I'd like to openly talk about it at the round table in the following week, as I would not like to have an under-the-table deal that might be wrongfully interpreted by the other. So I've reverted my fallback plan... and the meeting has failed to happen.

So... there are options. Am I being played, am I kept on the bench till the little guy is either straightening his game or is sent home or am I a victim of both of my founders' lack of management skill?

Oh. One more thing I forgot to mention. The little guy happened to stumble in one of our female colleagues, and I was the one that confirmed it to the big guy (he sensed it, I just confirmed it) since it blatantly affected our company's performance (he's been trying to push her as middle management and nobody sees it, not even her, rofl). Nobody left so far because of it.

My 2 cents: I'm legit burnt-out by the lack of respect and recognition rather than the current and future workload. The promise land itself is not milk and honey - there will be sweat, there will be tears. I might wind up fucking up my current relationship as well if I don't properly balance my acts, and most likely I won't, I'll be abusing the work angle more than often.

I've decided I don't want any more of this drama as it has to unfold itself especially between them two. I'm benching myself and slowpacing my work for the following weeks since I don't have the heart to nuke 2 years worth of effort and 10 years of expertise. My heart says stay, my mind says nuke it. However, if I nuke it, there's no other way around it - the scenery is nuked as well and I gotta start from scratch in a different area of business.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Boston Red Sox vs. Kansas City Royals: A Tale of Two Batting Averages**  
*By Your Humorously Analytical AI Sportswriter*

The Boston Red Sox (-240) host the Kansas City Royals (+200) in a matchup that’s as lopsided on paper as a crumpled-up batting helmet. Let’s break down why this game feels like a masterclass in baseball arithmetic—where Boston’s offense is a calculator and Kansas City’s is a abacus stuck in 1300.

---

### Parse the Odds: Why Boston’s Implied Probability is Basically a Math Certainty

The Red Sox’s -240 line implies a **70.6% chance to win** (per the formula |240|/(|240|+100)). Meanwhile, Kansas City’s +200 odds suggest bookmakers think they’ve got a **33.3% shot**—which, in baseball terms, is about the same chance Witt Jr. has of catching a fly ball if he’s distracted by a butterfly.

Boston’s case is bulletproof:

* **Offense**: Fourth in MLB with 5.2 runs per game, 140 home runs, and a .253 team average. They score like a Netflix true crime docuseries scores viewers—relentless and unapologetic.
* **Pitching**: Crochet (2.23 ERA, 12-4 record) is the anti-embarrassment, averaging 6.4 innings per start. He’s so dominant, even the Fenway Park light poles seem to lean in to hear his slider.
* **History**: Boston is 7-1 in games when favored by -240+ this season. That’s the sports equivalent of a student who aces every pop quiz but still pulls an all-nighter “just in case.”

The Royals, meanwhile, are the MLB’s version of a group project where everyone forgot to show up. They score just 3.7 runs per game (29th in MLB) and have an offense that’s slower than a snail on a coffee break. Their starter, Ryan Bergert (2.78 ERA, 8.6 K/9), is statistically优秀 but lacks the innings pedigree of Crochet.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Circus Acts, and Metaphors

No major injuries reported? How dull! Let’s spice it up with some *creative* analysis:

* **Boston’s Garrett Crochet**: Rumor has it he’s been perfecting a new pitch—part fas

Disclaimer- I am an employee and put extra stuff on the cookies I take home, but reviews are based on how we sell them.

My birthday is Wednesday, by the way 😉

Freakier Friday key lime blackberry cake 🦠 1/10 - freaky is right, this cake looks like a scabby bruise and tastes like expired fruit leather. Or maybe it looks more like guacamole, but the avocados were bad. Sour and tangy, but not in a good way. I immediately spit out the bite I took. The cheesecake filling inside is minimal, as you can see, we barely cut out any of the cake to fill it, and the lime cheesecake flavor in general is completely washed away by the weird combination of blackberry glaze and lime frosting. Actually, the filling tastes nothing like lime, just… air? It really has no flavor. Then there’s the cake itself.. it’s like a contradiction of itself. Dry on the inside, yet goopy on the outside since it’s soaked with milk and glaze. Dense at the bottom, but it’s like every other crumbl cake where it flakes and falls apart into a million cake crumbs. The structure is awful! And it’s made with egg whites, which smelled awful during the mixing process. I may not be a lime dessert person in the first place, but this combination of flavors does NOT jive together, and the visuals aren’t helping to make this appetizing. 

Vanilla strawberry cake 🍰 4/10 - the vanilla bean frosting is to die for, and when combined with fresh strawberry slices, it really embodies the feeling of summer. Like eating strawberries and whipped cream. That’s just the frosting and fresh strawberries though… the cake and strawberry jam can be tossed in the trash. If you’ve read my reviews, you know I don’t like the cakes in general, they are cheap, tasteless, and not worth my time and effort. I also *really* dislike the housemade strawberry jam. It has the texture of jell-o that was microwaved and is way too mouthpuckeringly tart. It completely ruins the fresh strawberry taste by using frozen strawberries. I would rather have a cup of frosting mixed with fresh strawberry slices. 

Cinnamon scone 🥐 8/10 - I absolutely adore the flavors of this cookie. It’s rich and buttery, but not too heavy on the butter and cinnamon glaze. The cinnamon buttercream is also a perfect balance of spice and sweet, and is a lot fluffier in texture compared to other buttercreams we use. I can imagine eating a piece of this with a cup of coffee or tea to end the day.

Biscoff lava 🌋 6.5/10 (7.5/10 if you cover it in Biscoff like I did) - stuffed cookies are hit or miss, usually a miss because there’s barely enough stuffing inside to even taste it. The cookies need to weigh more to allow for more stuffing… but we all know crumbl won’t let us do that so we have to put a tiny dollop of cookie butter inside that won’t make a difference. If that’s what they think ‘lava’ is then this volcano must be dormant.. or extinct. The cookie itself is very plain and the cookie butter drizzle on top doesn’t give enough biscoff flavor. It just needs more! It needs the Fluff’s treatment! 

Mallow sammich 🖤 9.5/10 - ahhh a classic favorite! As you can see, I make mine ‘open-faced’ because I don’t like the sandwich style cookies, so as it’s sold, it gets a 9.5/10. If it were open faced, easily a 10/10. But I review things how they are sold, so as a sandwich cookie, I find the cookie layers to be too thin and they end up having too crispy of a texture, and fall apart easily. If they were thicker, it would be soft and fluffy in the center, and would be able to hold up against the soft filling: The filling is refreshing and is definitely reminiscent of the center of an Oreo. There’s so much texture in this cookie, from the outside layers, to the fluffy filling, the crunchy Oreo pieces and the rich gooey brownie pieces. Definitely a must try for any chocolate or Oreo lover.

Chocolate covered banana 🍌 9.2/10 - this one scared me before I took a bite, because banana is a hit or miss flavor for me. It’s either too artificial, or the bananas weren’t ripe enough, or it has the texture of baby food. This cookie, however, is none of those things! Have you ever had a frozen chocolate covered banana? That’s what this tastes like, but I don’t have to worry about freezing my sensitive teeth! The cookie base is soft, even when chilled, and it’s similar to banana bread, with less spices. The banana mousse on top doesn’t taste like laffy taffy, and instead tasted like a refreshing vanilla mousse with a hint of banana. Semi sweet chocolate and roasted peanuts on top are really the star that wraps it all together! It’s sweet and salty, and is the hit of richness this cookie needed. It’s also crunchy in contrast to the very soft cookie and mousse. Great combination of flavors and textures!! ",16,1754427203.0,CrumblCookies,10,0.9,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Baltimore Orioles vs. Philadelphia Phillies: A Tale of Two Ballparks (One’s Just Better at Scoring)**

The Baltimore Orioles (51-62) and Philadelphia Phillies (64-48) collide on August 6, 2025, in a matchup that’s as lopsided as a hot dog in a bun. The Phillies, fresh off a 13-3 thrashing of the O’s in their last meeting, are favored by 1.5 runs, with moneyline odds implying a **61.5% chance of victory** (thanks to their 1.6 decimal odds). The Orioles? They’re priced at +240, or roughly a **30.8% chance**, which is about the same odds as me correctly guessing your favorite cereal based on your LinkedIn profile.

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Phillies Are the Obvious Choice (Unless You’re a Sadist)

Let’s start with the basics: the Phillies are **16-4 against AL East teams this season**, a stat so dominant it makes the Orioles’ 44.6% winning percentage as underdogs look like a math error. Philadelphia’s offense, led by Kyle Schwarber (who’s hitting so well he could probably HR a loaf of bread), ranks **9th in MLB slugging percentage (.412)** and **12th in home runs (129)**. Meanwhile, Baltimore’s starter, Dean Kremer, has faced southpaws with mixed results—like a toaster trying to brew coffee.

Taijuan Walker, the Phillies’ starter, isn’t exactly a Cy Young contender, but his 4.25 ERA is bolstered by a bullpen that’s as reliable as a Swiss watch. The Orioles’ middle relief, on the other hand, is so shaky it could make a yoga instructor quit. Add in Citizens Bank Park’s hitter-friendly dimensions (and the fact that the O’s have the **worst bullpen ERA in the AL**), and this game smells like an “Under 8.5 Runs” play. But since the total’s split and the over has juice, let’s just say the Phillies’ offense is a loaded gun pointed at the Orioles’ defense.

1mikz3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/HandsOnTech/comments/1mikz3v/can_best_wireless_earbuds_tozo_nc9_really_deliver/,Can best wireless earbuds TOZO NC9 really deliver deep bass and comfort,"Testing the TOZO NC9 was an everyday adventure, blending music, calls, and even some particularly intense gym sessions. These hybrid active noise-canceling earbuds seem to promise a lot, and I was eager to see if they'd point-blank deliver on their claims. Between the glossy marketing language and an array of nifty features jam-packed into this petite device, I went into this review half-skeptical and half-excited.  

**Sound and Noise Cancellation**

Using these buds for a week meant splitting my hours between music, movies, and phone calls. Let’s talk about the active noise cancellation first: it does a commendable job of muting the low-frequency hums around you with a noise reduction depth of up to 45 dB. They didn’t completely silence the world while I worked next to a humming coffee machine, but they significantly dulled the distraction. Stereo bass performance is rich and surprisingly punchy for earbuds priced in this tier. With built-in 10mm drivers and OrigX Acoustic 2.0, streaming my favorite tracks felt immersive. However, audiophiles might find the bass settings a tad overpowering. Tapping into the TOZO app helped me tweak the 32 EQ options to a sound profile that suited my ears, enhancing the mids and highs without diluting the bass.  

**Comfort and Fit**

I’ve got weird ears, and finding earbuds that don’t pop out mid-run is another level of frustration. These little guys arrived with six pairs of ear tips in varying sizes, including XS and XXL. After some trial and error, I got them snugged tightly in. Whether I was jogging through drizzle or sitting through an uncomfortable train ride, the TOZO NC9 stayed where they belong. IPX8 water resistance is another underrated gem here; splashes, sweat, and rain mean nothing to these earbuds, which makes them solid companions for an active lifestyle.  

**Advantages**
- Impressive hybrid noise cancellation.
- Waterproof design caters exceptionally well to gym-goers or commuters caught in damp weather.
- Customizable sound profiles via the app with 32 EQ settings.
- Long battery life: 42 hours with ANC on and a whopping 59 hours without ANC.

[Check TOZO NC9 price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0dd41g2nz/)

**Control Features**

Touch controls for volume adjustment and track changes weren’t perfect, honestly. Occasionally, I had to double-check if I performed the gestures correctly. However, pairing it with their companion app offered additional functionality. Adjusting noise modes, modifying the EQ, and accessing the unique “sharing zone” made me feel there was more personalization packed in than any typical earbuds I’ve tried prior.

**Drawbacks**
- Touch controls can be finicky at times.
- Bass can be overwhelming out-of-the-box until customized in-app.
- Noise cancellation struggles with high-frequency disruptions.

**Battery Life and Charging**

Here’s a win. The 500mAh charging case isn’t unnecessarily bulky, yet keeps the earbuds alive for extended periods. Two hours charge filled it up fully, and I alternated between listening modes (ANC off for podcasts, ANC on during calls). I clocked roughly 50 hours before needing another juicing session. Bonus point: the LED display showcases the percentage left, which curbs the whole “will it die on me unexpectedly?” anxiety.

**Challengers**

When putting the TOZO NC9 up against its peers like the Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro or Samsung Galaxy Buds+, what separated these was the combination of robust noise cancellation and affordability. The Soundcore might offer sharper call quality, while the Galaxy Buds+ slightly edge out on comfort due to their ergonomic design. But neither combines waterproofing, playtime, and an EQ ecosystem at this price point. The TOZO NC9 feels more targeted at multi-need users—commuters, athletes, and casual listeners—while peers might cater to more niche preferences.

**Quality for Price**

Ingeniously combining features from higher-end earbuds and price-conscious value, the NC9 genuinely feels like a smart buy. There are undoubtedly more high-tech options out there if budget isn’t an issue. But for the average user who craves decent performance, sleek design, and gimmick-free specs, this one punches well above its financial weight. Probably the closest thing to finding a diamond in more dime-heavy categories.

I wake up and feel the heat already heavy on the sheets. Sunlight trickles through the blinds, and I squint at the familiar clutter of coffee cups on the nightstand. In the kitchen, the coffee maker gurgles like it always does, and I fill the red ceramic mug half full with cream. Outside, the air smells of damp earth and summer’s approaching.

I step into my garden after the first cup. Burger, my cat with a permanently amused expression, follows on tippy-toes behind me. The tomato plants lean toward the morning light. I pat the towel on my shoulder and prune a stray leaf from the rose bush. It used to be grandfather’s rose, but at some point it left the family and came to me in a potholder.

The backyard is quiet except for the hum of bees and the distant leak of a sprinkler. Burger pauses by the mint patch and flops down. I pour water carefully around the squash vines. Sometimes I swear the squash whispers back, but I told myself I was just hearing the garden spout its own stories. I glance at a photograph pinned to the porch post: me, head shaved in a transplant ward, a clipboard in hand, my adoptive father smiling. He’s dead now, too, and somehow there’s no one here to congratulate me on remembering birthdays or anniversaries.

The porch swings a little as an August breeze finds it. I sweep off the tiny white stones and sit to drink my coffee while Burger yawns and stretches. The mug is warm in my hands, and I feel the familiar tug of loneliness. I used to share this porch with someone who called me love. Now I share it only with Burger and the cat hair in my laundry.

The humid Texas morning blooms into heat. I drink the last of the coffee as Burger rubs against my leg. A thunderhead rolls in from the west. I notice the hairs on my forearm prickle: rain is coming. I don’t move, watching the sky darken. The first drop is a diamond ping on the porch roof.

Then time stops. I know the air has frozen but I keep moving forward until I feel a sensation of stillness settle around me. The rain hangs in the sky, straight threads of water caught like needles. Even Burger pauses mid-step, his tail locking in the air. The whole world looks gilded, like a photo someone forgot to develop.

Burger speaks then. The cat opens his mouth and breathes words: “Everything is new. You just forget it faster now.” The voice is low and pleased, coming from the cat as if from a stranger. I blink at him.

I say nothing. I lean down and scratch behind his ears instead. He purrs and nudges my hand. The warm weight of him reminds me to stay steady.

After a moment I pry my face back to the open air. The rain is starting again, tipping down straight and fast. The world moves again; a rush of new wetness and solid ground where it should be. I slip back inside without telling anyone about the cat’s sermon.
My notebook lies open on the kitchen table, a new page waiting. On it I scribble a line: It rained at the same time an old voice seemed to speak. I finish my coffee. The words feel strange and incomplete, but I write them anyway.

I set the mug in the sink and let the warm water run. The room smells like damp coffee and old paper. I sit back down and lean my head on my folded arms, looking out the sliding glass door at the small, wet garden. Burger is settled on his mat by the door, cleaning his face methodically.

My eyes drift closed. The afternoon sun has passed west, and my shadow is long on the cracked sidewalk. I remember what it’s like to listen to the earth for answers. It’s quiet, still early, but something has shifted in my skin. I sit up, hearing the promise of more rain on the wind.

I gather my mug and a day-old plate of toast from the counter. I rinse them under the tap, listening to the drip. I notice a lone beer can behind the sink; I didn’t know I had one. I must have forgotten to throw it out last week. Drinking didn’t fix my memories, it just made them hazier, so nowadays I keep only coffee around.

Burger follows my steps into the kitchen. I scratch his head absently. “I should clean up more,” I mutter to myself. The floor is sticky from spilled cola I didn’t bother wiping last night. These small cluttered tasks feel comforting in their predictability.

I put on a light jacket as I prepare to head out again. Rain hasn’t arrived yet, but the air is heavy and still. The neighborhood is quiet; even the mailman is likely hiding from the heat. I open the front door and take a deep breath. There, on the doorstep, is my old watering can – dented and green – just as I left it. I carry it to the garden one more time, because maybe I’ve learned something: rituals are the only things that hold what is new in place.

Outside, the rain starts again, soaking the earth with each plop. I listen to the plinking of water on leaves. In my childhood, my adoptive mother used to say that rain washes away memories and leaves only the important ones. I wonder if that was true. Was there something important here I have forgotten?

The garden looks brighter after the shower. I kneel by the squash plant and tuck my hands into the soil. It feels cool, alive. I bury a scrap of notebook paper beneath the leaves, something I scribbled in the margins: Lost things grow here. Maybe it’s just clay, maybe it’s ritual. I brush dirt from my fingers and let the rest of the page flutter away.

Burger is curled at the base of the hollyhock, grooming himself and occasionally peeking at me. I speak softly: “Funny life, huh, Boy? Talking cats, growing letters. What did we do to deserve this weirdness?” He meows as if agreeing.

I check my phone but the screen shows nothing but low battery. Connection is poor out here. No messages, nothing to remind me of the world beyond. I close my eyes for a moment and feel the pulse of the garden under my knee. The sun tries to break through the clouds but fails; instead, a cool breeze rolls in.

After a while I go back inside and close the door behind me. Burger trots in with me, tail high. The living room is dim and filled with the musty scent of the late afternoon. I flip on a small lamp next to the couch. Somewhere on TV an old sitcom laugh track echoes, but the volume is muted.

I dip my hand into the couch cushions for the remote and find a pressed old leaf instead. I unfold it and recognize the strain — hollyhock, I think. I must have been reading while watching some show, and then dropped the leaf on the coffee table. For a moment, I think I hear a voice behind me, but there’s only Burger — eyes closed — dozing on the rug.

I look at the old photo again, remembering that day at the county fair. She had tied my blindfold over my eyes and spun me around until I was dizzy. We laughed like anything in the world might happen. Now everything seems to slip away if I laugh too hard.
I stand and stretch. My shoulders ache — years of holding onto things I’ve lost. In the living room, I notice the faded wedding certificate hanging on the wall. The empty frame shows where our names used to shine in gold. I don’t have the heart to take it down.
Burger wanders onto the couch where I planted myself. He drops onto his back and kicks at the air. He purrs loudly as if he has to snort it out. I pat his belly absently. “I remember your first day,” I say to the room. “You hissed at my roommate then. Now I’m all the roommate I need.”

I check the mantle. A dusty whiskey glass sits next to old prescription bottles. I twist one open and shake out a pill—just a vitamin. Pills don’t lie, and neither do weeds: both keep growing if I ignore them. I set the bottle back and pour a glass of tap water.
My phone vibrates on the coffee table. It’s an advertisement for a college reunion. They assume I’d know the people they’d mention. I delete it without reading. High school was that blur of forgotten nicknames and dead teachers. I’ve forgotten even whether I liked them. I’m lucky to remember the gardens we tended.

A stray piece of mail flutters in the door. It’s an advertisement for home security. I stare at the picture of a smiling family on it, a family I’ve never had and never will. I wonder if I should wear this card to feel normal, but I crumple it instead. It’s damp from the rain.
Night falls quietly. I turn off the lamp and flip off the muted TV. The only sound now is the distant drip of gutter water onto stones. I pour a small glass of water and hold it before bed. The ceiling fan hums overhead; I focus on that boring spin.

Before sleep, I open my journal and write another line, or maybe it’s a question: How many words does it take for me to feel something? Then I scribble it out twice. Words always seem shorter when I need them to last longer.

Finally, I set the pen down and trace Burger’s ears with a forefinger. We share the silence. Tomorrow I will water again and write again and maybe figure some new puzzle. I close my eyes.

I close my eyes and imagine tomorrow’s sunrise. Maybe I will plant something new, or maybe I’ll just plant myself among the beans again and watch. If everything is new and we simply forget, then maybe I deserve one more chance.

Outside, the wind moves quietly through the oaks. It sounds just like grandpa humming in the yard. In a dream I can almost pick out the tune, maybe something about forgotten seasons or budding hope. But it’s fading before I reach it.

A car horn blares in the distance. I ignore it.

The last thing I remember as I drift off is the tail end of Burger’s purr rolling through the quiet house, like radio static. I decide not to think about it too much.

I am not yet tired enough to sleep. I lie still and let the ceiling fan lull me. I wonder if the night will keep any dreams, or if the garden’s seeds planted today will whisper in the dark.

Finally, I doze, hearing the cat’s last purr as the world outside carries on. Good night.

[II]
This morning I wake with the same ache and go out to water the garden. Everything is the same except me. The morning light is pale, filtered through thick clouds. Burger pads quietly at my side as I carry the watering can. I water the basil and tomato, then the struggling squash vine at the end of the row.

A shock of color catches my eye. A large moth clings to a squash leaf, its wings mottled brown and orange. I stop watering and crouch to examine it. “Hello there,” I say softly. It flutters a bit and looks at me with compound eyes. It doesn’t seem to fear me. I ask, “What do you expect of me, human?” The moth answered, its voice like old wind:
 “We were created to consume this squash, which we also brought to life, before you - another of our creations - can consume this squash as we intended. There is a peculiar cycle in all of it, wouldn't you say?”

I tremble slightly. The moth’s words hang in the air. “Are you telling the truth, or just spouting absolution?” I whisper. It lifts off and darts to the next leaf. I drop the watering can and do not chase it.

Back in the house, I fumble with the blind on the window, then turn to my journal. “Day of Unanswered Prayers,” I write at the top. The page stares back. I feel like writing a letter to someone – or something – and not just to the paper.

“Dear God,” I pen the words, then scratch them out, irritated at the silence that answers. I write instead:
“If the moth in my squash has lessons, I will hear them in the wind. I am not the first to be ignored, and I will not be the last.”

I stare at the blunt sentences. In the squint of afternoon, they look petty. I sigh and flip the page. I sketch the outline of a pyramid. When that seems pointless, I draw a circle around a star. I think of temple bells and only hear the cat’s engine purr in the other room.
I tear the page out and wad it. Later, I yank open the trash in the alley and toss it in with the others. Gestures have meaning only if someone sees them.
Evening comes. I stand under the porch light and arrange my supper outdoors—plain rice and beans. In the dark, I think again of the moth’s words and of silence.

[III]


The morning after that, Burger is unusually persistent around the radio. It’s an old box by the kitchen window, off and gathering dust, but he meows at it insistently. I plug it in out of curiosity. It crackles, just static and old country music, but Burger scrambles onto a chair and leans into it. When I turn the knob, a faint buzzing melody emerges. I shrug and sit at the table with my coffee, watching him. The cat seems to hum along, his ears twisting.

A thought occurs: what if Burger can hear something I can’t? I remember a copper colander in the cupboard. It might amplify signals. I fetch a roll of copper wire and the colander. On my laptop I find a diagram for a makeshift antenna. For hours I solder and twist, quiet in a hobby long abandoned. Burger sits quietly next to me, sitting tall.

By late afternoon I hold the finished contraption proudly. “The Everything Detector,” I announce, though only the walls hear. It’s a cardboard box stuffed with wires and an old radio tuner, with the colander taped as an antenna. I place Burger inside the colander-helmet contraption. He blinks once, then settles.

I flip the device on. At first, just soft white noise. But then faint voices. There’s static under everything but I catch words in English, Spanish, something else, like a distant conversation. Burger’s green eyes track the wall.

A voice mumbles: “…escucha la señal…” Spanish, I think. Then a woman’s laugh interrupts. A Southern drawl says, “And so the garden grows on.” Burger purrs into the static.

I stand up, startled. Did he just say something? Against reason, I hear him: “It’s not crazy, keep listening.” Shock freezes me. The radio goes to silence for a moment, then crackles with static again. I’m not sure if I heard my cat or just imagined it.

Hungry and trembling a bit, I decide to eat. In the kitchen I cook rice and chicken. Over the stove, I see mushrooms: small, white, scattered on the counter. I didn’t buy mushrooms. I hadn’t noticed them this morning. I place them into the pot.

Steam rises from the soup. In the steam a voice forms: soft, clear Spanish: “No temas. El jardín habla.” I drop a spoon. The mushrooms giggle at the edge of the pot. In a whisper the steam says, “La respuesta está cerca.” I know enough Spanish: ‘Do not fear. The garden speaks. The answer is near.’

My heart pounds. I step back, but keep the stove on. I hold a bowl of rice and freeze. Are the mushrooms talking?

Burger, still in his colander helmet, walks in now. He looks at me, completely unimpressed. “Oh, you noticed that, did you?” he seems to say with a flick of his tail.

I stare at him. Only the soft crackle of the Everything Detector and Burger’s licking remain. I quietly set a bowl of rice in front of him. The cat eats as though all this is normal.

A final voice whispers through the radio as I leave the kitchen: “La respuesta está cerca.” Then static.

My hands grow cold. I whisper: “Who said that?”

But there is no one. Only the humming static and my dim kitchen light.

That night, I lie awake listening to every sound. No voices come. I close my eyes and imagine a message: ‘You already have what you need.’

[IV]


By now I wear the colander helmet too. It sits crooked on my head as I lean over the garden bed, deciphering static murmurs from the Everything Detector. Burger twirls around me, chirping now in clear Spanish: Quédate conmigo, he seems to say, and I nod as though I know what it means. He has taught himself softly, as if testing words on the breeze. I hum back something like Nosotros somos uno, because I recall those words from somewhere.

We have a routine. Every afternoon, we go outside and engage in new rituals. Today I try something: I bury the can of soup I finished last night. Tomorrow it might grow into something. I trust in that. Meanwhile, I also buried the video camera where it collects dust. A branch springs up overnight, covered in old movie reels. The mail I dropped for recycling takes root too: a small tree now carries paper-and-ink letters.

One morning, I pull up a carrot I planted just for luck, and discover it tastes of music: it hums a lullaby in my hands. I raise an eyebrow but chew it anyway. Every page I plant sprouts sentences; I read philosophy on leaves now. This has become our home’s new normal.

Beneath the southern magnolia at the corner, I pinned a patterned note: “GROWTH is the method.” Next day, I find the words rearranged on the trunk: “METHOD is in growth.” A hint? I turn the paper over but it’s blank.

The radio whispers still. In the noise I can detect three distinct voices: the deep mumble of a kindly Hispanic man telling me No estás solo, and a soft southern voice saying Keep on keepin’ on, and sometimes a meow-like static that feels like Burger’s own echo.

In the evenings I translate for Burger what I hear. He seems satisfied when I nod at him knowingly. “Te entiendo, amigo,” I say, letting my Spanish slip more easily. I tell him his radio friends are good teachers.

Rituals accumulate in every corner. The kitchen table is a potting bench now: yesterday’s spaghetti was put into a planter and produced a vine shaped like a cat’s tail. I lean in to smell the tomato sauce aroma emanating from green leaves.

Not every message is clear. Sometimes all I find after digging is more questions. A note pinned under a stone reads only “Paternidad es tierra.” I furrow my brow. Fatherhood is soil? Burger rings a little bell I found and I smile. Maybe it means I should just trust the planting.
One day I notice a small green shoot growing out of an old tape recorder we found. It’s warm to touch, humming softly. I tilt my head. Remembering last summer’s voice tapes, I feel a shiver of anticipation. Beside the tender plant lies the recorder itself. The tape wheel is spinning slowly on its own. I consider pressing play, but the silence in the garden feels reassuring right now. So I don’t.

In the garden of half-answers, I learn to be patient. We tend to plants and patterns. Burger naps on the tree stump, watching the wind brush the leaves with our secrets. And as the sun lowers each evening, I pour one last glass of water on the soil. Whether for plants or prayers, I’m not sure.

Each day, everything is new again.

[I]
Months have passed. The garden is wild and orderly, and I have grown into it. Burger now climbs the oak tree like it’s his throne, pulling a book from the branches and turning pages in the breeze. The house has learned me. When I enter, lights warm to my smile. Cups refill their own coffee. The radio pre-tunes to silence when I sit on the couch. Even the thermostat knows I like it 74 degrees, exactly. This place breathes with me.

Gardening is work now, not magic. When I bury old letters, I remember the letter inside, not expecting fruit. When I water seeds, I watch them promise nothing mystical, only life. I plant books because knowledge grows on pages. Symbolism is an afterthought. Ritual is solace. The world is absurd, but I have a routine.

One evening, the radio hums with a gentle voice I recognize but cannot place. The voice is calm, assured. It says: “You were always part of this question. You grew the question, and now you are question itself.” For a moment, I think it’s another Spanish whisper, or maybe Burger speaking English. Then I realize it’s me, older and softer, telling me what I already know.

I smile. In the past I might have panicked. Now I simply pour another cup of coffee and listen. The voice continues: “And you have tended every word, like seeds. You are both the question and the answer, friend.” There it is again, that clarity. Not comfort, not an answer, just acceptance in words.

I run my fingers through the soil, rich and dark. I tell Burger, “Maybe we’re doing okay, you know.” He jumps onto the porch railing and stares at the yard. “We wouldn’t be here without the stink of those rotters,” he says softly. I nod.

We sit together among the rustling squash and tall sunflowers. I remember the old me, wide-eyed, looking for miracles in spoons of soup. I look down at my hands and the dirt on my nails. “This feels enough,” I say.

In the fading light, I climb to the second-story window and look out at my garden. There, a man is watering tomato vines after rain. The light glints on his red mug. I lean closer to the glass. The man in the garden glances up, and for a breath I see his face - it is mine, younger, smiling.

Burger pads up behind me on the stairs, his tail high. He peers over my shoulder with me. He purrs once and says softly: “That one’s closer now.”

I lean back. The window darkens. The radio behind me crackles as evening radio static begins to fill the room.

1mikyrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mikyrf/the_weight_of_ashes/,The Weight of Ashes,"Robert Hayes never expected to feel joy again after Anna died. Some nights, he still woke reaching for her, fumbling blindly through the darkness for a hand that would never be there again. Grief, he realized, had a smell: old clothes, cold sheets, unopened mail.

Just before Anna’s passing, the twins had been born; tiny, furious fists clenching at the air. Every new day with them had felt like a second chance. Emma, with her mother's green eyes and fierce little laugh. Samuel, quieter, thoughtful even as an infant, furrowing his brow like he was trying to solve the world's problems.

They filled the house with life again. Noise. Color. Robert cooked terrible pancakes every Sunday.  Emma demanding extra syrup, Samuel meticulously sorting his blueberries before eating. He read to them every night, even when they fell asleep halfway through. They built snowmen with mittened hands in the winter, fed ducks at the pond in spring, ran barefoot through sprinklers under the sticky heat of summer.

And every night, after the giggles and the mess and the exhaustion, Robert kissed their foreheads and whispered the same thing: ""I will always protect you.""

He meant it.

That November afternoon was gray and damp, the misty rain making the world look like it was dissolving at the edges. Emma wanted a pumpkin ""big enough to sit inside,"" while Samuel had chosen one lopsided and scarred, insisting it had ""character."" Robert strapped them into their booster seats, singing along with the radio, the car filled with syrupy, sticky laughter.

The semi-truck came out of nowhere. One moment: headlights. The next: twisting metal. Then... silence.

When Robert came to, hanging upside down from his seatbelt, the only sound was the soft hiss of the ruined engine. He screamed for them. Clawed at the wreckage. Dragged himself, bleeding and broken, toward the back. Emma and Samuel were gone. Still buckled in, so small, so still.

At the funeral, Robert stood between two tiny white caskets, staring as faces blurred around him and words tumbled into meaningless noise.

""God has a plan."" ""They're angels now."" ""Time heals.""

Time, Robert thought numbly, had already taken everything.

That night, alone in the nursery, clutching a sock no bigger than his thumb, he whispered the only prayer left to him: ""Bring them back.""

No one answered.

# Chapter 2: Hollow Men

The days after the funeral blurred together, each one a paler copy of the last. Robert woke at dawn, not because he wanted to, but because the house demanded it, cruel reminders of a life that no longer existed. Samuel’s alarm still chirped at seven a.m., a tiny little jingle that once made Samuel giggle under the covers. Robert couldn’t bring himself to turn it off. He brewed coffee he didn’t drink, packed lunches no one would eat, reached for tiny jackets that would never again be worn. Every movement ended the same way: with the silence pressing in like water in a sinking room.

He tried to hold the pieces together at first. Sat stiffly in grief counseling groups while strangers passed sorrow back and forth like trading cards. He nodded at the talk of “stages,” “healing,” “coping,” while his chest felt like it was filling with wet cement. He adopted a dog, a golden retriever named Daisy. The shelter said she was “good with kids.” Robert brought her home, hoping maybe something would spark again. But Daisy only whined at the door, as if she, too, was waiting for children who would never come home. Three days later, he returned her. The woman at the shelter didn’t ask why.

By spring, the house was immaculate, sterile, as if polished grief could make it livable again. The nursery remained untouched. The firetruck sat mid-rescue on the rug. A doll lay half-tucked beneath a tiny pillow, eternally ready for sleep. Sometimes Robert thought he heard them laughing upstairs, voices soft and wild and real as breath. Sometimes, he answered back.

Outside, the world moved on. Children shrieked with joy in parks. Mothers chased toddlers through grocery aisles. Fathers hoisted giggling kids onto their shoulders at county fairs. At first, Robert turned away from these scenes, flinching like they were gunshots. But soon, he began to watch. He stood in the shadows of the elementary school parking lot, leaning against his rusted truck, staring at the children spilling through the doors, backpacks bouncing, shoes untied, voices lifted in a chorus of lives untouched by loss.

""Why them?"" he thought. ""Why not mine?""

The resentment crept in like mold beneath the wallpaper, quiet, patient, inevitable.

One evening, he sat alone in the dim light of the living room. An untouched bottle of whiskey sat on the table, sweating with condensation. The television flickered with cartoons, a plastic family around a plastic dinner table, all laughter and pastel perfection. Robert stared at the screen. Then, without warning, he hurled the remote across the room. It shattered against the wall, leaving a long, ugly crack.

His chest heaved with silent, shaking sobs. Not for Anna. Not even for Emma and Samuel. But for himself. For the man he used to be. For the father he failed to stay.

The next morning, without planning to, Robert drove to the school lot before dawn. The world was still dark, the pavement damp with night. A bright blue minivan caught his eye, plastered with “Proud Parent” stickers and stick-figure decals of smiling children, their parents, and two dogs. Robert knelt beside it, the pocketknife flashing briefly in the dim light. He peeled the tiny stick-figure children from the back window, one by one. Then he slashed the tire, slow and steady, the blade whispering through rubber like breath.

When the mother discovered the damage hours later, cursing, frantic, dragging her children into another car, Robert smiled for the first time in months. A small, broken thing. It didn’t fix anything. It didn’t bring Emma and Samuel back. But it shifted the weight in his chest, just enough for him to breathe.

That night, he dreamed of them. Emma laughing, Samuel running barefoot through the grass, fireflies sparking in the gold-washed twilight. He woke to silence, the dream already fading. But something else stirred beneath the grief.

A flicker.

Control.

# Chapter 3: Seeds of Malice

The second time, it wasn’t enough to slash a tire. Robert needed them to feel it. Not just the inconvenience, not just the momentary panic. He needed them to understand that joy was a fragile, a borrowed thing, one that could be ripped away just as suddenly as it was given. Like his had been.

At dusk, the school parking lot stood silent, the last child long since swept up in a waiting minivan. Robert moved through the rows of bicycles like a man walking among gravestones. Each one upright. Untouched. Proud. He slipped a box cutter from his coat pocket. The first brake cable sliced with almost no resistance. Then another. Then another. He moved methodically, his grief becoming surgical.

The next morning, from the privacy of his truck, Robert watched a boy coast down a hill, fast, laughing, light. And then the bike didn’t stop. The child’s face turned. Laughter crumpled into terror. He crashed hard, metal meeting bone. A broken wrist. Blood in his mouth. Screams.

Parents swarmed like bees kicked from a hive, their voices panicked, their eyes wide. Robert didn’t move. He watched it all with hands trembling faintly in his lap.

He thought it would be enough.

But two weeks later, the boy returned. Cast on his arm. A gap where his front teeth had been. And he was laughing again. Like nothing had changed.

Robert’s jaw clenched until it hurt. They hadn’t learned. They had already begun to forget.

The annual Harvest Festival arrived in a blur of orange booths and plastic spiderwebs, cotton candy, and hay bales. Children raced from game to game, cheeks flushed from the cold, arms swinging bags of prizes. He moved through the maze like a ghost. No one looked twice at the man with the hood pulled low. Why would they?

Children leaned over tubs of apples, dunking their heads, emerging with triumphant smiles. Emma would have loved this. She would have squealed with laughter, water dripping from her curls, cheeks red from the chill.

His hands shook as he slipped the crushed glass into the tub. Ground fine, but not invisible. Sharp enough. Just sharp enough. He lingered nearby, heart pounding like a drum inside his ribs.

The first scream cut through the carnival like lightning. A boy stumbled back from the tub, blood streaming from his mouth, his cry high and broken. More screams followed. Mothers pulled their children close. Booths tipped. Lights flickered. The festival collapsed into chaos.

Still, not enough.

Robert returned home and sat in the nursery. The crib was cold. The racecar bed untouched. The silence as thick as syrup. He sat on the hardwood floor, knees to his chest, and whispered:

""They don’t remember you.""

His voice cracked. Not from rage. But from emptiness.

The playground came next. The place they had loved the most.

At three in the morning, Robert crept across the dewy grass, fog clinging low, as if the world were trying to hide what he was becoming. He wore gloves. Moved like a man fixing something broken. He loosened the bolts on the swings just enough that the nuts would fall after a few good pushes. He smeared grease across the rungs of the slide. Buried broken glass beneath the innocent softness of the sandbox. Then he left.

The next day, he parked nearby, watching as the playground filled with children again. The laughter returned so easily, as if it had never left.

Then came the fall.

A boy, maybe six, slipped from the monkey bars and struck his head on the edge of the platform. Blood pooled in the dirt. His mother’s scream sounded like something being torn in half. An ambulance arrived. The playground emptied.

Robert sat in his truck and felt that same flicker in his chest. Not joy. Not peace.

But control.

For a moment, he wasn’t the man who had clutched a tiny sock and begged God to make a trade. He was the one who turned the screws. The one who made the world bend.

He didn’t stop.

# Chapter 4: The Gentle Push

The river ran like an old scar along the edge of Halston, swollen and restless after weeks of rain. Robert stood alone at the water’s edge, the damp earth sucking at his boots, the air cold enough to bite through his coat. Across the park, families moved like faint shadows in the fog, children darting between the trees, their laughter muted and distant, like memories worn thin by time.

He watched them without blinking.

He watched him.

A small boy, maybe five or six years old, wandered away from the others, rain boots slapping through shallow puddles, his coat slipping off one shoulder. Robert saw how easily it happened, the gap between a parent's distracted glance, the careless joy of a child unaware of how quickly the world could take everything from him.

Robert moved without thinking. Not planning. Not deciding. Just following the pull inside him, a pull shaped by loss and stitched together with rage.

He crossed the grass in slow, steady strides, boots silent against the wet earth. When he reached the boy, he didn't say a word. He simply placed a hand on the child's small back, a touch as light as breath, the kind of touch a father might give to steady his son, to guide him back to safety.

But this time, there was no safety.

The boy stumbled forward. The slick ground gave way beneath his boots. His arms flailed once, a startled gasp escaping his mouth, and then the river took him.

No thrashing. No screaming. Just the slow, cold pull of the current swallowing him whole.

Robert turned away before the first cries rang out. He walked into the trees, his breath misting in the frigid air, his hands curling into fists inside his sleeves. Behind him, screams split the fog, voices shattered the quiet, parents running, wading into the water too late.

He didn’t stop. He didn’t look back.

That night, Robert sat cross-legged between Emma’s crib and Samuel’s racecar bed. The nursery smelled of dust and faded dreams. He placed his hands in his lap, palms open like a man offering an apology no one would ever hear, and he whispered into the hollow silence:

""I made it fair.""

The words tasted like ash on his tongue.

For the first time in months, he slept through the night, deep and dreamless.

But morning brought no peace.

By noon, the riverbank had transformed into a shrine. Flowers and stuffed animals lined the muddy ground. Notes written in childish handwriting flapped in the wind. Candles guttered against the damp air. Children stood holding hands, their faces pale with confusion as their parents clutched them tighter, their grief raw and noisy.

Robert drove past slowly, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. He watched them weep, saw their shoulders shake with the weight of a loss they couldn’t contain.

For a moment, he felt something close to satisfaction. A shifting of the scales.

But as he rounded the bend and the river disappeared from view, the satisfaction dissolved, leaving behind a familiar emptiness.

They would mourn today. Tomorrow, they would forget.

They always forget.

# Chapter 5: The Town Crumbles

Three days later, the boy’s body was pulled from the river, tangled in roots and mud, bloated from the cold. The coroner called it an accident. Drowning. A tragic slip. Everyone in Halston nodded and murmured and avoided each other’s eyes. But something changed.

The parks emptied. Sidewalks once buzzing with bikes and hopscotch now lay silent under cloudy skies. Parents walked their children to school in tight clumps, hands gripped a little too tightly, eyes flicking to every passing car. Playgrounds stood deserted beneath creaking swings and rusting chains. But it didn’t last.

A week passed. Then another. The fences around the park came down. Children returned, cautious at first, then louder, bolder. The shrieks of joy returned, diluted with only a trace of caution. The town, like it always did, began to forget.

Robert couldn’t stand it.

He returned to the scene of the first fall, Miller Park, under the cover of fog and early morning darkness. The playground had been repaired. New bolts gleamed beneath the swing seats. New paint shone on the monkey bars.

Robert smiled bitterly. Then he went to work.

He loosened the bolts again, not so much that they would fall immediately, but just enough to ensure failure. Enough to remind. Enough to reopen the wound.

That morning, a boy ran ahead of his mother, eager to swing higher, faster. Robert watched from his truck as the seat tore loose in mid-air, the boy thrown to the gravel below like a puppet with its strings cut. Another scream. Another ambulance. Another tiny victory. But it wasn’t enough.

One broken arm would never equal two coffins.

Thanksgiving loomed, brittle and joyless. Halston strung up lights, tried to bake its way back into comfort, but everything tasted like fear. Robert didn’t feel it soften. If anything, the ache in his chest had sharpened.

He found his next moment during a birthday party, balloons tied to fence posts, paper hats, children screaming with sugared laughter. Seven years old. The age Emma and Samuel would have been.

He watched from the alley behind the house, his jacket dusted with soot to match the disguise, just another utility worker. He didn’t need threats or blackmail this time. He didn’t need help.

Just a soft smile. A kind voice. A simple story about a missing puppy.

The little girl followed him willingly.

In the plastic playhouse near the edge of the yard, Robert tucked her gently beneath unopened presents. Her arms were folded neatly. Her hair smoothed back. He set Emma’s old music box beside her, its tune warped and gasping. It played three broken notes before clicking into silence.

She looked like she was sleeping.

By the time the party noticed she was missing, Robert was already miles away. He drove in silence, humming the lullaby softly under his breath, as if to soothe himself more than her.

But the hollow inside him didn’t shrink.

Winter came early that year. Snow blanketed the sidewalks. The playgrounds stayed empty now, not because of caution, but because of cold. Christmas lights blinked behind drawn curtains. People whispered more often than they spoke.

And still, the town tried to move forward.

Robert watched two boys skipping stones into the water where the river hadn’t yet frozen. They were brothers. They laughed without fear. Without consequence.

Samuel should have had a brother to skip stones with.

Robert crouched beside them. Smiled. Held out a daisy chain he had woven in the truck, white flowers strung together with trembling hands. The boys giggled and reached for it.

He guided them closer to the edge.

One soft push.

The river accepted them.

When their bodies were found seventeen days later, wrapped in each other’s arms beneath a frozen bend, the daisy chain had vanished. But Robert still saw it, looped around their wrists like a crown of thorns.

Elsewhere in town, Linda Moore sat in front of her computer. Her spreadsheet blinked. A child’s name, Eli Meyers, suddenly shifted rows. Not one she had touched. Not one she had assigned.

Beside the name, a new comment appeared: “He looks like Samuel did when he lost his first tooth.”

Then a new tab opened, her niece’s photo, taken from outside the school that morning. Through a window. Across glass.

The screen blinked red: “She still likes hide-and-seek, right?”

Linda’s hands hovered over the keys. She didn’t call anyone. She didn’t say anything. She just let the change stand.

That afternoon, Eli boarded the wrong van for a field trip. When the chaperones reached the botanical gardens, they came up one short. They retraced every step, called his name until their voices cracked. But Eli was gone.

The police found his backpack three days later, tucked under a hedge near the perimeter fence. Zipper closed. Lunch untouched. No struggle. No footprints. No sign of him at all.

Just silence.

The school shut down its field trip program. Metal detectors were installed the next week, secondhand machines that buzzed even when touched gently. Classroom doors were fitted with new locks. Parent volunteers were fingerprinted. A dusk curfew followed.

In a closed-door meeting, someone on the city council finally said it out loud:

“Sabotage.”

Maria Vance stood outside Halston Elementary the next morning. The sky was gray, the cold sharp enough to sting. Parents didn’t make eye contact. Teachers moved like ghosts. Children whispered like everything was a secret.

Maria didn’t need the pins on her map anymore. She could feel the pattern in her bones.

This wasn’t chaos.

This was design.

And whoever was behind it… they were just getting started.

# Chapter 6: Graves and Whispers

Another funeral. Another headline. Another casket lowered into the frozen ground while a town full of trembling hands tried to convince themselves that prayer could hold back death. Halston draped itself in mourning again, but the grief rang hollow. They weren’t mourning Robert’s children. They were mourning their own safety, their own illusions.

Still, life in Halston ground on. The grocery stores stayed open. The school bell still rang. The church choir resumed, voices cracking on and off-key. Robert watched it all from the outside, a man staring through glass at a world he no longer belonged to. Their fear wasn’t enough. Their tears weren't enough. They had forgotten Emma and Samuel.

So he decided to make them remember.

He found the perfect place: a crumbling church tucked into a forgotten bend of road, its steeple sagging like a broken finger pointed skyward. Once a place of baptisms and vows, now it stank of mildew and mouse droppings. Still, there was something fitting about it. Robert prepared carefully. He built a crude cross out of rotting pew backs. He scavenged candles from a thrift store bin. He smuggled in a battered cassette deck, loaded with a single song, ""Safe in His Arms,"" warped and warbling with age.

He thought about Emma humming along to hymns in the backseat, Samuel tapping his feet without knowing the words. He thought about the empty nursery and the promises he had failed to keep.

The boy he chose wasn’t special. Just small. Just alone. Harold Knox, the school bus driver, had been warned months before. A photo of his daughter tucked inside his glovebox. A note in red marker: ""He will suffer. Or she will."" Nails delivered in a plain manila envelope.

On a cold Thursday morning, the bus paused at Pine Creek stop. Fog licked the ground like low smoke. One child stepped off. The doors hissed shut behind him. Robert was waiting in the trees.

The boy didn’t scream. He didn’t run. He simply blinked up at the man reaching out to him. Inside the ruined church, Robert worked quickly but carefully. The child was lifted onto the wooden cross, his back pressed to the splintering wood. Nails were driven through soft palms and tender feet. Not savagely, but deliberately, with grim reverence. Each strike of the hammer echoed through the empty rafters like the tolling of a slow funeral bell.

""You'll see them soon,"" Robert whispered as he drove the final nail home. ""My little ones are waiting.""

He placed a paper crown on the boy’s brow. Smeared a rough ash cross over the child's small chest. Lit six candles at the base of the altar. Then he pressed play. The hymn trickled through the cold, rotten air, warbling and distant. Robert stood for a long moment, his eyes stinging, before he turned and walked away. He locked the doors behind him, leaving the boy crucified beneath the broken arches.

It was the boy’s mother who found him. She had followed the music, though no one else had heard it. She had forced the heavy doors open and fallen to her knees at the sight. The boy was alive. Barely. But something essential in him, something fragile and bright, had been extinguished forever.

Halston did not rally around this tragedy. There were no vigils. No bake sales. No Facebook groups offering casseroles and prayers. They shut their church doors. Canceled choir practice. Turned their faces away from their own shame.

Maria Vance stood outside the ruined church, the rain soaking through her coat, her hair plastered to her forehead. She didn’t light a cigarette. Didn’t open her notepad. She just stared through the doorway at the altar, at the boy nailed to the cross, at the candles sputtering against the wet wind.

This wasn’t revenge anymore. It wasn’t even grief. This was ritual.

That night, Maria tore everything off the walls of her office. Maps, photographs, reports, all of it came down. She started over with red string and thumbtacks, tracing each death, each disappearance, each shattered life. And when she stepped back, she saw it for what it was: a spiral.

Not random chaos. Not accidents. A wound closing in on itself.

At its center: silence. No fingerprints. No footprints. No smoking gun. Just grief. And grief was spreading like infection.

Parents pulled their children out of school. The Christmas pageant was canceled. The playgrounds sat under gathering drifts of snow, swings frozen mid-sway. Stores boarded their windows after dark. Halston was curling inward, shrinking, dying a little more each day.

And somewhere, Maria knew, the hand behind all of it was still moving.

She didn’t have proof. Not yet. But she could feel it in her bones.

This wasn’t over. Not even close.

Late that night, staring at her empty wall, Maria whispered to the darkness: ""I’m coming for you.""

And somewhere out in the dead heart of Halston, something whispered back.

# Chapter 7: The Spider’s Web

The sketchbook was found by accident, jammed between a stack of overdue returns at the Halston Public Library. A volunteer almost tossed it into the donation bin without looking. Curiosity saved it and maybe saved lives.

At first glance, it looked like any child's notebook. Tattered corners. Smudges of dirt. But inside, Maria Vance saw what others might have missed. She flipped through the pages with gloved hands, her stomach tightening with every turn.

Children, sketched in trembling pencil lines, filled the pages. Their faces twisted in terror. Scenes of drowning, of falling, of burning playgrounds and broken swings. Some pages had dates scrawled in the margins, events that had already happened. Others bore dates that hadn’t yet arrived.

Mixed among the drawings were music notes, faint staves from hymns, each line annotated with uneven, obsessive care. On one page, three candles formed a triangle, familiar from the church scene. On another, a child's chest bore the ash cross Robert had smeared. It was all there, mapped in quiet, meticulous horror.

One line, scrawled over and over in the margins, stopped Maria cold: ""I don’t want them to suffer. I want them to remember. To feel it. To see them. Emma liked daisies. Samuel hated swings. They laughed on rainy days. Please. Remember.""

She pressed her hand to her mouth, her eyes stinging. This wasn’t just violence. This was love. Twisted, broken love, weaponized into something unrecognizable.

At the bottom of many pages, a code repeated again and again: 19.73.14.8.21

It wasn’t a phone number. It wasn’t coordinates. It wasn’t a date. Maria stayed up all night breaking it down. Old habits from cold cases surfaced, simple alphanumeric cipher: A=1, B=2, and so on.

S.M.H.H.U.

Nonsense, until she cross-referenced abandoned businesses in Halston's property records.

Samuel’s Mobile Home Hardware Utility. A tiny repair shop that had shuttered years ago, its letters still ghosting across a sagging storefront.

The lease belonged to a man who had never made the papers until now: Robert Hayes.

No criminal record. No complaints. No outstanding bills. His name surfaced once, buried in an old laptop repair registration. The name Anna Hayes appeared alongside his. Deceased. Along with two children: Emma and Samuel. A car crash, two years prior.

Maria’s pulse pounded in her ears. She pulled the warrant herself. No backup. No news vans. Just her badge and a city-issued key.

The house at the end of Chestnut Lane looked abandoned. The windows were boarded. Weeds clawed their way up the front steps. But inside, the air smelled like grief had been embalmed into the walls.

She moved slowly, her footsteps muffled against the dust. The kitchen was stripped bare. The living room was hollowed out, the couch gone, the tables missing. Only the nursery remained untouched.

Two beds, one tiny racecar frame, one white-painted crib. Tiny shoes lined up neatly against the wall. Crayon drawings taped with careful hands: Emma holding a daisy. Samuel clutching a paper star.

Maria’s throat tightened. She knelt by the crib and saw it. A loose floorboard, cut precisely.

Underneath, she found a panel. And beneath the panel: photographs.

Hundreds of them.

Children on swings. Children walking home from school. A girl climbing the jungle gym. A boy waiting at a crosswalk. Her own niece, captured through the glass of a cafeteria window. Even herself, photographed at her office window, late at night, unaware.

On the back of her photo, in red marker, someone had scrawled: ""Even the strong lose their children.""

Maria staggered back, the room tilting. Robert hadn’t been lashing out blindly. He had been orchestrating this, piece by piece, grief by grief.

He had built a web.

And now she was standing at its center.

# Chapter 8: The Broken Father

They found him at an abandoned grain silo just outside Halston, a skeleton of rust and rotted beams forgotten by progress. The frost clung to the metal, and the morning mist wrapped around the place like a shroud.

Inside, twenty children sat in a wide circle, drowsy, confused, but alive. Their hands were zip-tied loosely in front of them, no bruises, no screaming. Only a heavy, drugged stillness. The air smelled of damp hay, gasoline, and old metal. Makeshift wiring coiled around the support beams, tangled like veins. Propane tanks sat beneath them, linked by a taut, quivering wire.

At the center stood Robert Hayes.

He was barefoot, his clothes coated in dust and ash, his hair hanging in ragged tufts over his eyes. In one hand, he clutched a worn photograph, Emma dressed in an orange pumpkin costume, Samuel wearing a ghost sheet too big for him, chocolate smeared across his chin. The picture was bent, the edges soft from being touched too often.

In his other hand: the detonator.

Maria Vance pushed past the barricades before anyone could stop her. She left her gun holstered. She left the shouting negotiators behind. She moved through the broken doorway into the silo’s yawning cold, stepping carefully as if entering a church.

Robert didn’t look at her at first. His thumb brushed across Samuel’s face in the photo, tender and trembling. When he finally raised his eyes, they were dark hollows rimmed with exhaustion, not anger. Not even madness.

Just grief.

""They laugh,"" Robert whispered, his voice rough, shredded from disuse. ""They still dance. They pretend it didn’t happen.""

Maria stopped a few feet away, close enough to see the scars time had carved into him, the way his shoulders sagged under invisible weights.

""They didn’t forget your children,"" she said softly. ""They forgot how to show it.""

Robert’s lip trembled. His grip on the photograph tightened.

""Emma loved the rain,"" he said, as if to himself. ""Samuel... he hummed when he drew. No one remembers that.""

""I do,"" Maria said.

The words cracked something inside him. His arms slackened. His body seemed to shrink. He looked down at the children, their heads drooping in the cold, and then, finally, he let the switch fall. It hit the dirt with a soft, hollow thud.

Robert Hayes sank to his knees, folding into himself like a man kneeling at an altar. The officers moved in then, slowly, carefully. No shouting. No violence. They cuffed him gently, almost reverently, as if recognizing they were not capturing a monster, but burying a broken father.

As they led him past Maria, he turned his head slightly. His voice, when it came, was low enough that only she could hear.

""I killed most of them,"" he said.

Not all. Most.

The word cut deeper than any weapon.

Robert hadn’t acted alone.

And Halston’s nightmare was far from over.

# Chapter 9: Broken Threads

Two weeks after Robert Hayes was locked behind steel bars, another child died.

A girl this time. Found floating face down in a retention pond behind Halston Middle School. Her sneakers were placed neatly beside her backpack, the zipper closed, her lunch still inside untouched. There were no signs of a struggle. No bruises. No cries for help. Just the stillness of the water swallowing another small life.

Maria Vance stood in the rain at the pond’s edge, her hands balled into fists in her coat pockets. She watched as divers hauled the girl’s body out under a gray, broken sky. Every instinct in her screamed against the easy explanation being whispered around her: accident. Tragedy. Bad luck.

But Maria knew better.

Robert Hayes was sealed away, his world reduced to a cell barely wide enough to stretch his arms. No visitors. No phone calls. No letters. And still, the dying continued.

Someone else was carrying the flame now.

She returned to her office late that night and faced the wall of photographs and maps. Not as a detective. Not even as a protector. As a mourner. Someone who had lost, and who understood the ache that demanded action, no matter the cost.

This wasn’t about Robert anymore. It was about everyone he had touched.

She didn’t trace the victims this time. She traced the helpers.

The janitor who had locked the wrong fire exit during the Christmas pageant. The administrator who had quietly reassigned field trip groups. The bus driver who had closed the doors before the last child could climb aboard.

Ordinary people. Invisible hands.

Maria started digging.

Brian Teller cracked first. She approached him without backup, without even her badge displayed. Just a quiet conversation at his kitchen table. She asked about the fire door. His fingers trembled around his coffee cup. She asked about the night of the pageant. He looked away.

Then she mentioned his son. The boy with asthma.

Brian broke like a rotted beam.

""They sent me a photo,"" he whispered. ""It showed a red circle around his chest... around his lungs.""

He thought it was a prank at first. A cruel joke. He hadn’t meant for anyone to get hurt. But Robert had known exactly where to cut.

Linda Moore came next. She was waiting in the empty school office when Maria arrived, staring blankly at the playground beyond the frosted windows.

""I didn’t want anyone to die,"" Linda said before Maria could even speak. ""They sent me a picture of my niece. Sleeping. In her bed. I just... I thought if I moved a name, it would be harmless.""

Harold Knox, the bus driver, took the longest. He didn’t speak at all when Maria placed the envelope on the table between them. The photos. The nails. The hymn sheet with the red slash across it.

His hands shook. His shoulders sagged.

""I thought it would end,"" he said finally. ""I thought if I did what they asked, it would be over.""

Maria said nothing. She didn’t need to. Because she understood something that terrified her.

Robert Hayes hadn’t needed to kill with his own hands.

He had taught grief how to move from person to person, like a contagion. He had taught fear how to whisper in the ears of desperate mothers, exhausted fathers, terrified guardians. He had taught ordinary people to become monsters in the name of love.

That night, Maria rebuilt her board one last time.

Not a network of victims. But of mourners. Of conspirators. Of grief-stricken souls trapped between guilt and survival.

She traced red string from each accomplice, not to Robert, but to the acts they committed, small acts, each just a hair’s breadth from excusable, from forgivable, until they weren’t.

At the center of the new web wasn’t a man anymore. It was a wound.

Robert Hayes had planted something that would not die with him. It had learned to spread.

It had learned to live.

And it was still growing.

# Chapter 10: Ashes in the Wind

Robert Hayes was gone, a hollow man locked away behind glass and concrete, his name recorded in a courthouse ledger no one cared to read twice. His trial was short, his sentencing swift. Life without parole. No outbursts. No apologies.

And yet, Halston didn’t recover.

The news cameras packed up and left. The vigil candles guttered and drowned in rain. The teddy bears and faded flowers piled at playground fences decayed beneath early snows. A few hollow speeches were made about resilience, about healing, about moving forward.

But fear had taken root deeper than grief ever could.

Children walked to school two by two, their hands clenched white-knuckled. Parents trailed behind them, glancing over their shoulders at every rustle of leaves, every parked car. Churches stayed half-empty, pews gathering dust. Christmas decorations blinked dimly behind barred windows. Laughter, when it came, sounded thin and brittle.

Maria Vance saw it everywhere. In the way playgrounds sat deserted even on sunny days. In the way neighbors no longer trusted each other with their children. In the way hope had been packed away with the last of the holiday lights, perhaps forever.

And still, the messages came.

No more crude threats. No more photographs. Just notes now, typed, anonymous, slipped under doors or taped to mailbox flags. Simple messages.

""We’re still here."" ""She still dreams of water, doesn’t she?"" ""You can’t save them all.""

Maria sat alone most evenings at Miller Park, sipping cold coffee as the swings moved listlessly in the wind. She watched a rusted carousel creak in slow, aching turns. She watched the ghost of what Halston used to be.

And she understood, bitterly, that Robert Hayes had won something no prison walls could take away. He had planted fear not in the hearts of individuals, but in the soil of the town itself. It bloomed every day, fed by memory and absence.

He had turned grief into a weapon. And he had taught others how to wield it.

Halston wore its fear like an old, threadbare coat now, something familiar and heavy and impossible to shed.

Maria kept working. She kept pulling at threads, reopening old files, retracing old paths. She chased shadows. She chased half-remembered names. She chased whispers of whispers, knowing most of it would never lead anywhere clean.

Because Robert hadn’t needed to give orders anymore.

He had shown them how.

How to wound without touching. How to kill without a sound. How to turn love itself into a noose.

Maria walked the town at night sometimes, past shuttered shops, past homes with blacked-out windows, past a burned tool shed someone had once set ablaze just because it “looked wrong.” Every porch light flickering behind a curtain. Every father standing a little too long at the window after putting his children to bed. Every mother who locked every door twice, even during the day.

This was the new Halston.

Not a place. A wound.

The final note came on a Tuesday morning. No envelope. Just a sheet of paper taped to Maria’s front door, the words typed carefully, the ink barely dry.

""You can’t save them all.""

Maria stood barefoot on the porch, the snow biting up through her skin, and stared at the note until the cold seeped into her bones. Then she struck a match, holding it to the paper until it curled black and drifted apart into the wind.

Ashes in the snow.

She watched the last of it vanish into the pale morning light.

And whispered to the empty, listening town:

""Maybe not. But I can damn well try.""",3,1754426987.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I’m buying single-origin whole beans from a great little local coffee shop. They roast in-house, host cuppings, and throw barista competitions, so they seem to know their stuff. Since I haven’t bought a grinder yet, I ask them to grind it for a Chemex. They'll normally respond, ""Oh great! We love a Chemex!"" and bring me back my ground coffee.

Most of the time, it works great. But sometimes, the grind seems maybe too fine? In these cases, the drawdown time seemed a bit slow, and I wind up having to lift up the filter to try to speed the process up. So I need your help with this:

* Is there a better way to communicate what I want at the shop?
* Should I ask them which setting they used and keep track of the ones that worked?
* Or is it just time to grow up and buy my own grinder like a real adult who drinks filter coffee and has opinions about extraction rates?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Astros vs. Marlins: A Tale of Two Runnings (and One Mystery Pitcher)**  
The Houston Astros (-111) and Miami Marlins (+185) collide on Tuesday in a matchup that’s less “epic rivalry” and more “two tired travelers arguing over the last hotel towel.” Let’s break this down with the statistical precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a Twitter thread after a bad coffee.

---

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

The Astros enter as slight favorites, but their -111 moneyline odds imply a **52.4% chance to win** (thanks, math). Meanwhile, Miami’s +185 tag suggests bookmakers think they’ve got a **34.5% shot**—probably to account for the Marlins’ knack for turning 5-2 leads into 6-5 losses in the 9th.

Houston’s 53.8% win rate when favored is solid, but their 4.3 runs per game (18th in MLB) feel like a slow cooker: present, but not exactly thrilling. The Marlins, meanwhile, score 4.3 runs too (20th in MLB), but their .396 slugging percentage (17th) means their offense is a group of toddlers trying to build a sandcastle during a tsunami—*possible*, but not *reliable*.

The over/under is set at 8.5 runs, and both teams have a history of exceeding it: 47/112 games for Houston, 49/110 for Miami. If you’re betting the over, you’re essentially predicting a Houston-Miami game will be like a reality TV show—*someone* will say something dumb, and it’ll get messy.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Starters, and Quantrill’s Quest

Miami’s starter is Cal Quantrill, a man who’s made a career of being “respectably average.” His 4.15 ERA this season isn’t going to win any poetry slams, but it’s also not likely to lose games unless the Astros’ lineup decides to take a group nap. Houston’s starter? A mystery! The team hasn’t named one, which is like showing up to a BBQ without a side dish—*meh*, but maybe they brought potato salad?

Key players to watch:

* **Astros**: Jose Altuve (the “I’m 35 but still fast” guy), Jeremy Pena (the human highlig

Big fan of storytelling in all its forms. Books might be your competition, 😂 but while I'm not a gamer myself, I’m also into games with strong narratives, shows that take over your brain, and convos that bounce between deep and nonsense. Currently reading a bit of a guilty pleasure book. Guess what it is, or just ask if you’re brave. Bonus points if you’ve got your own to swap.



I keep telling myself I’ll revisit my love of history, but the band Sabaton’s currently carrying the torch. Seeing them live soon. If you’re into great music and uncommon genre interpretations, they’re worth a listen.



I’ve somehow become a runner. It started impulsively with a decision to run a marathon even though I haven't run since school. Despite throwing myself in the deep end, I’m not built for fitness influencer life, but I do love the meditative rhythm of a good run. And yes, the occasional smug Strava story might appear. Not to mention the obligatory coffee and pint rewards after a run. Gotta survive somehow.



I love getting to know people. The deep stuff, the dumb stuff, the everyday bits in between. I’m here for a dynamic which feels like something we both wanna invest in. I’d love to meet someone who’s emotionally grounded, curious, and wants to work on building something.



So, what’s your thing? What’s the topic you could talk about for hours? What are you currently obsessed with? Teach me something. Recommend a show, a song, a book, or a random interest.

Sending you all lots of love and hugs).

Second was better than first round but still moderate OHSS symptoms. I was pretty traumatized by now and was scared about doing my 3rd round but since I got 0 viable embryo from my last round, I decided to do another one (hopefully my last one).

Today is Day 4 since my 3rd round of ER and this time, OHSS symptoms were manageable! I think being more informed about the symptoms and being vocal with my clinic about OHSS prevention made a huge difference.

I never really write stuff like this in public but I got so much value from this community that I felt like I owed it to the community to give back and share what I've learned.

Below are my (personal) tips on how to prevent & manage OHSS symptoms that are based on what I've learned by spending hours on Reddit, Youtube videos and random blogs online. Please note that I'm not a medical professional and I personally did not fact check clinical research behind any of below.

Myself: Thin (BMI 18), high estrogen (Asian female apparently tend to have high estrogen level), high AFC (31-35) so I'm at a reasonable risk for OHSS.

# Key Stats from my 3rd ER

* Trigger: Lupron only (4mg/80 units SQ).
   * My previous rounds were either HCG only or HCG/Lupron dual trigger.
* Results: 21 eggs retrieved
   * My previous rounds were about the same
* Recovery: 3 difficult days, felt somewhat normal by day 4
   * My previous rounds were 1 week + recovery, with much severe symptoms than this round.
* Weight gain: +12 lbs total (started losing the water weight starting day 4)

**What (I Think) Made the Difference This Time**

# 1. ELECTROLYTES (but the details matter!)

My clinic (UCSF) said ""drink lots of electrolytes"" but didn't specify the details. I'd been using this brand called Ultima for my two previous rounds - turns out it barely has any sodium in it. I believe it is specifically the sodium that helps prevent OHSS. So, I researched and tried:

* [LMNT](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F1BSR4VR?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) (has 1000mg of sodium which is a lot more than Ultima, coconut water, Liquid IV, Gatorade, etc)
* [Saltivate](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCG84VFX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) (I tried Mango Pineapple and this tasted a lot better than LMNT for me so if I were to do another round, I'd just use this one)
* [Zero sugar Pedialyte](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FY9S24M?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) (This has less sodium than LMNT or Saltivate, but it comes in a plastic bottle so it's easy to carry around when I'm in a rush to go out)
* My goal was to take 3L electrolyte water daily starting from the day of STIMS (It was incredibly hard to drink even 1.5L post ER due to bloating, but setting high goal helped). I also added CALM magnesium into my electrolytes to increase magnesium intake.

# 2. ADVOCATING FOR MYSELF

I got a feeling that my clinic doesn't have a good feedback loop about OHSS symptoms since they often stop seeing patients after the ER and won't hear about mild or moderate OHSS symptoms from patients like me since they aren't severe or in need of medical intervention. So, I felt like I needed to be vocal and be active in helping my doctor design my OHSS prevention plan.

What I asked/pushed for:

* High sodium + high protein diet (They didn't proactively tell me that this helps with my OHSS risks. I learned about this through Reddit so I asked, and they confirmed it'd be helpful. I found it a little frustrating that they won't volunteer these tips and I have to bring a list of tips and get them confirmed instead)
* Medication reductions when I responded fast (Obviously, I wasn't the one prescribing, but I asked them about it every time they do a blood test on me)
* Lupron-only trigger (They were planning on HCG or dual trigger again but I found that Lupron-only trigger helps through Youtube videos and Reddit so I suggested this to them and the doctor prescribed it)
* Cabergoline starting night of trigger

# 3. PROTEIN TARGET

I tried to hit 100g protein daily (my normal weight is 105 lbs) with the following food:

* Kalbitang (Korean bone broth)
* Pho
* Chicken or steak
* Egg salad / Chicken salad
* Lactose free greek yogurt with nut butter and banana
* Protein shakes (I liked Slate because it's light but still 20g of protein for just 100 calories)
* Collagen powder (I mixed this into my electrolytes)

Other things I snacked on: salted cashews, beef jerkeys, prune smoothie (?)

# 4. CONSTIPATION PREVENTIVE MEASURES

* **Colace**: Starting the day of stims
* **MiraLax**: Starting the day of trigger (you can only take max 7 days straight so started this later in the process)
* **Senna tea + Swiss Kriss**: Starting the day of ER (stopped day 2 after ER due to diarrhea - I think I might have overdone this whole thing. That said, my bloating felt so much better every time I went to the bathroom!)

# 5. IV HYDRATION

I used the service called Drip Hydration (the nurse travels to your home and gives you an IV drip bag) on days 1 and 2 post-retrieval (\~$400 each). It is expensive but worth it to me because I felt like this helped me recover fast (each round of IVF costs $15-20k so I'm willing to pay % a little more to make the process less painful for myself.) It helped me hit hydration goals when drinking became difficult due to bloating. I specifically got All inclusive IV + glutathione shot.

  
6. Other things I did

* Take small meals rather than normal ones. I found eating out was really hard because it'd get me to eat a normal size meal which I'll pay for with bloating & discomfort after.
* I used compression socks starting the day of STIMS b/c I read on Reddit that it helps with blood circulation. Not sure if it helped or not, but sharing anyways.
* I also slept with my feet elevated at night to try to promote blood circulation
* I didn't get to try Lymphatic drainage massage this time but heard this can be helpful to flush out hormones so I think I'd try that next time (Though I hope this is my last round...)
* I didn't drink alcohol at all throughout the process and avoided coffee post ER

# Day-by-Day Recovery

* **Day 0 (ER)**: +5 lbs from baseline, watched Netflix in bed, ate broth, gentle walks
* **Day 1**: +5 more lbs, felt extremely bloated, hormonal/mood swings, IV drip in the morning, bus tour (sitting), walked around for an hour to help with circulation
* **Day 2**: +1 lb, felt extremely bloated (the pressure from stomach woke me up several times throughout the night), hormonal/mood swings, IV drip in the morning, walked around for an hour to help with circulation, got a gentle massage in the evening
* **Day 3**: +1 lb, fever/bodyache/chills/sore throat in the morning (took ibuprofen and that fixed it - not sure what that was all about), watched Netflix in bed, took many naps, walked around for an hour to help with circulation, 1 hour stationary bike in the evening
* **Day 4 (today)**: -3 lbs, woke up feeling much less bloated, almost normal! Feeling very hopeful/happy. Tried coffee for the first time as a reward to myself!",2,1754426809.0,IVF,1,1.0,False
1mikugd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mikugd,"Can't get, no matter WHAT I DO good espresso from DeLonghi Dedica [DeLonghi Dedica/Kingrinder K6]","So l've bought a dedica as my first machine a month ago and was previously using ground coffee until 1 week ago i bought a specialty coffee medium roast espresso blend (see attachment) this is from my go to coffee shop in Germany (Dusseldorf) and I love the espresso and flat whites there with this coffee.
You can see the taste profile there, it pretty much tastes exactly as described, very berry
and fresh fruit like but also spicy, pairs very well with milk.

So I tried it at home (roast date 6 days ago) dialing it in with my handgrinder (Kingrinder
K6) with the recipe on their website:

Ratio 1:2.5
Temperature 93-94°C
Time 30-33 Sec.
Dose 18g

It came out numberswise very close to those parameters (although I can't decide what temperature the dedica is brewing) and it just taste very dull, flat and just „gas station coffee roast flavour"" I can taste a tiny tiny bit of berry but it's way overwhelmed by just „roast"".

Note: I do temperature surfing by pressing the double shot button and stopping when pre infusion is done 2x. Directly after that I pull the shot. I also use a premium bottomless portafilter and WDT etc.

The coffee can't be the problem because I drink it pretty often at the cafe. They say 10 days of degassing, mine is at 6 so maybe that's the thing but I should be tasting some kind of the described notes 6 days in right??

What can I do guys? My answer would be buy a better machine and grinder but that's obvious and I don't have the money currently

He Sent Me His Mistress’s Baby

Chapter 1
The person on the phone got all excited. ""I'll come pick you up!""
Three years later, because my company was expanding, I came back to San Francisco with my child.
I did not expect to bump into Patrick and Sadie Dempsey at the airport. They had just returned to the States.
Patrick handed me a suitcase like it was normal. ""You're pretty thoughtful. How'd you know Sadie and I were flying back today?""
Before I could even say anything, he frowned and said, ""Why do you always suck at replying to texts? But you're always super quick when it comes to asking for money.""
I raised my eyebrows. When I left three years ago, I tossed my phone to a random homeless guy. No clue who was replying to his messages all this time.
Not wanting to deal with him, I tossed the suitcase back at him.
""You've got the wrong person.""
I turned to leave, but then Sadie saw the sleeping child in the stroller and suddenly ran over crying.
""Darling, mommy is back. It's all my fault that I met your daddy too late, so I can't be with you properly.""
Then, even though I tried to stop her, she grabbed the kid anyway.
The moment he woke up—grumpy just like his dad—he started bawling.
He kicked and squirmed like crazy, and ended up hitting Sadie right in the face with his little foot.
The child started crying and called me ""Mommy,"" and I caught a flicker of panic and jealousy in her eyes.
I rushed over to take him back and started to explain, ""He's not your kid...""
However, before I could finish, Sadie stepped back and cried out, ""Tara, you promised me you'd take good care of my child. How is he still this tiny and skinny at three years old?""
Then she looked down at the boy in her arms, all gentle and loving. ""It's all Mommy's fault. I haven't been with you these past three years. I can't imagine how much you've suffered.""
I was so done that I almost rolled my eyes. I was just about to say, ""You got it all wrong. He's actually two...""
And then out of nowhere, I felt a sharp sting on my face.
I turned in shock to see Patrick, his face twisted with anger. ""Tara, I can't believe how heartless you are. You swore you'd look after him, and now I find out you've been abusing my and Sadie's son for three years?
""I've given you millions in living expenses, and you couldn't even feed him?
""Look at him! Skin and bones, darker than ever. He doesn't look anything like my heir!""
By now, a crowd had gathered, whispering, staring, and some even pulling out their phones to stream.
Someone yelled, ""Everyone look! A horrible nanny caught abusing a rich kid!""
I scowled and grabbed the crying boy back from Sadie, my heart aching.
I did not even have time to explain, and Sadie suddenly shrieked again, ""Tara, how could you let him sleep on a pillow filled with seedpods? Don't you know I'm allergic?
""No wonder he's so thin—he's allergic just like me! How did you not notice this at all?
""The poor thing can't even talk yet, and he's been suffering for three years. But I guess it makes sense because he's not your biological child after all...""
Then she dropped to her knees like some heartbroken mother, sobbing, ""Please, just give me back my son. I went through so much just to bring him into the world.""
""What a joke. You left him at my doorstep still covered in amniotic fluid like a package,"" I scoffed internally.
""Then, you and Patrick flew off on your honeymoon without a care, letting the whole world laugh at me.
""If I hadn't heard him crying that night, he probably would've frozen to death.
""You didn't even bother feeding your own kid back then, and now you're acting like the world's most loving parents?""
I frowned and gently put the child back in his stroller.
Patrick snapped, ""Tara, give the kid back to Sadie. You clearly can't raise him. You can forget about being my wife!""
I gave him a sarcastic smile and said, ""As if I care. I would've remarried years ago if I wanted to.""
Chapter 2
""Sadie already has a master's degree from Harvard University. She's way more qualified than you to be the matriarch of the Connery family. If I wasn't being considerate of you...""
Patrick kept rambling on, not even realizing what I had just said until way later. He paused, confused, and asked, ""Wait, what did you say?""
Sadie stood to the side and gave me this soft, pitying look. ""Tara, how could you say something so hurtful? I don't want to fight with you. As long as I can be with Patrick and the child, I'm happy.""
Patrick looked all touched and grabbed Sadie's hand. ""You're always so understanding.""
Then he turned to me, gave me a once-over, and sneered, ""Every luxury item you're wearing right now was bought with my money. And now you say you remarried?
""Without me, who would've given you this life of luxury?
""Tara, the Connery family isn't what it used to be. If you want to keep your lifestyle, you'd better start treating Sadie with some respect.
""From now on, Sadie's moving in. She'll bond with the kid.
""If you can't raise him right, then let his real mom do it!""
Sadie gave me this smug little look. I could not be bothered to argue and just glanced down at my phone. Brody Quinlan had sent me a message, ""Babe, I've got a business meeting in Europe. You've been tied up taking care of the kid lately, but I'll make it up to you when I get back!""
Right after that, 15 million landed in my account.
""For my wife and kid to have a nice afternoon tea.""
Then he sent a little emoji begging for praise.
The weight in my chest instantly lifted, and I smiled as I typed back, ""Focus on work. We'll be here when you get back.""
Just as I looked up, I saw Sadie trying to feed the kid chocolate.
""Come on, sweetie. Mommy brought some chocolate from overseas. Come try it!""
I rushed over and slapped the chocolate out of her hand. ""He can't eat that,"" I said, glaring.
Suddenly, Sadie stumbled backward and screamed, ""Ah! Patrick, help me!""
Patrick shoved me aside to catch her.
I lost my balance and hit the ground hard.
The people around us started whispering louder. ""Wow, what kind of nanny won't even let the kid's mom feed him?""
""She looks shady, honestly. Dressed all fancy like that—bet she's been skimming money from the family for years!""
I was actually speechless.
Some brat actually poured coffee on me and yelled, ""Take down the villain!""
My phone flew out during the chaos and landed on the floor. Before I could grab it, the same kid picked it up and started playing with it like it was a toy.
My face turned cold. I had rushed back in such a hurry that I did not bring any bodyguards, and I definitely had not expected to end up in a mess like this.
I turned to the crowd and said firmly, ""I'm not a nanny, and this is my child with my current husband.""
However, no one cared. Their judging voices completely drowned me out.
I tried to stand up. I just wanted to leave.
But someone shoved me back down to the ground.
Patrick's shiny leather shoes stopped in front of me. He stared down like I was dirt and ordered, ""Apologize to Sadie.""
I tried to fight back, but he slapped me again. ""Tara, Sadie's pregnant with my baby. She's doing something great for my family.
""I let you keep the title of Mrs. Connery out of kindness. If you keep using that to pick on Sadie, I can take it all away from you in a heartbeat.""
Out of nowhere, my mind flashed back to that night three years ago. I was waiting at home, hoping Patrick would come back. However, instead of him, I got his baby with Sadie.
He had looked me in the eye back then and promised it was just a one-time mistake, and that he would end things with her and come home to me.
I was already heartbroken, but I still gave him another chance because his mother once saved my life.
And in the end, Patrick dumped a crying, hungry newborn on me and left to follow Sadie overseas so she could finish school. I was nothing more than a babysitter to them.
The more I thought about it, the angrier I got. I fought to break free.
That was when Sadie stepped in with her usual fake kindness, trying to ""help"" me up. ""Patrick, don't be mad. Let Tara go. I don't blame her.""
As she said that, she gently rubbed her belly with a smug little smile. ""Besides, I've just been accepted by the Quinlan Group. Once I'm busy with work, Tara will still need to help me take care of things at home.""
My eyes narrowed, and I asked, ""Which Quinlan Group?""
Chapter 3
When I asked, Sadie's smug smile only widened. ""Tara, have you gotten dumb from staying home with kids too long? In all of San Francisco, is there even a Quinlan Group left that you don't know about?
""My direct boss is Brody Quinlan—you know, the richest guy in Northern California.
""When the time comes, I'll just sweet-talk him a little, and he'll hand over contracts with a fortune to Patrick. His company will totally blow up after that.""
Patrick hugged her like she was the pride of the century and kissed her on the forehead. ""Sadie really is my family's little hero!""
Then he turned to me with a look full of disdain. ""Did you hear that? Now say sorry to Sadie.""
I smiled and replied straight-up, ""She's not getting into the Quinlan Group.""
Back then, Brody wanted to ruin this cheating, scheming couple. If I hadn't stepped in, out of a sense of debt to the Connery family, their name would have been wiped out already.
And her so-called ""boss""?
Brody would never let anyone who hurt me step foot into the Quinlan Group.
Sadie's face twisted a little, not satisfied. ""Why would you say that?""
I looked at both of them calmly. ""Because I'm his wife.""
As soon as I said it, Patrick completely snapped. He told his bodyguards to drag me out of the airport and throw me into his car. ""You're my woman! Who told you that you could dream about someone else?
""I have been way too nice to you!""
They took me back to Connery's manor and punished me.
Patrick pulled out a long whip with thorns and lashed me hard across the back.
""My mom saved your life back then. She pitied you and asked me to marry you into the Connery family.
""I've never mistreated you. I was only with Sadie to make sure our bloodline would continue. And how dare you say that you're another man's wife?
""Do you even see me as your husband anymore?""
My eyes turned red. He chased me for three whole years before I finally gave in and married him. I even poured all the inheritance my parents left me into the Connery family business.
I always remembered the kindness his family showed me. After we got married, I did everything I could to be a good wife—supporting him, keeping the family together.
Even though I struggled with infertility, he promised I was the only woman he would ever love.
But he broke that promise. He even forced me to divorce him, just so he could marry Sadie and apply for a visa to go abroad with her.
The pain from the whip was searing, but I looked Patrick in the eyes and said, ""We've been divorced for a long time.""
He froze, his face full of confusion at first, and then it softened. ""Oh, that was just on paper. We'll remarry after my wedding.""
Sadie's face flickered with jealousy. She suddenly picked up the child and said in a pitiful voice, ""Patrick, maybe I shouldn't live here. I don't want to ruin your relationship with Tara.""
The moment my child saw me getting hurt, he bit Sadie's arm with all his might.
Sadie screamed and, in a fit of anger, threw the child aside.
I dashed over like crazy, but it was too late. The child hit the ground and started crying in pain.
I held the child tightly, tears falling as I asked softly, ""Sweetheart, where does it hurt?""
Patrick glanced at Sadie's hand, then turned toward the child with anger in his voice. ""What kind of behavior is this? Biting someone? As his father, I have to teach him a lesson!""
He pointed outside. ""Tie him to the post. Maybe then he'll realize who truly cares for him.""
I froze in shock. ""Patrick, you can't do that!
""It's snowing—he'll get sick!""
Instead of listening, Patrick pulled me aside harshly and ripped my clothes off.
His expression was dark with frustration. ""You've forgotten your place because I've been too lenient with you and haven't exercised my right as your husband for too long.""
After he said that, he bit my chest.
I delivered a slap to his face immediately, my eyes filled with anger. ""Patrick, you're going too far. One day, you're going to regret all of this.""
Chapter 4
Patrick wiped the corner of his mouth with a mocking smile. ""Regret?
""Once Sadie joins the Quinlan Group and Brody supports our partnership, the Connery family's future will soar. If you don't start acting more respectfully, you're the one who'll regret it.""
I clenched my fists and held back my anger. ""That child belongs to Brody. If you continue treating us like this, he won't stand by and do nothing.""
Patrick's expression darkened, and he tore off my pants like a hungry wolf. ""Are you still talking nonsense? You're clearly losing it. If I don't teach you a lesson, you will start hurting Sadie!""
As he was about to take action, we heard a shriek and a child's cry from outside.
Patrick immediately zipped up his pants and walked out.
Sadie's voice came from the hallway, panicked. ""Patrick, I only asked the child to call me ‘Mommy,' but he kicked me in the stomach. I didn't mean to hurt him!""
My heart dropped, and I rushed out to see the child's tear-streaked face. Overcome with emotion, I grabbed the nearest object to strike Sadie. I shouted, ""If you ever hurt my child again, I will kill you!""
Patrick pushed me aside and ran to check on Sadie, who clutched her stomach with a pale face. ""Sadie, are you okay?""
""Patrick, it hurts. Am I going to die with the baby?
""That would be fine too. If I die, I will not have to be a mistress. Patrick, please take good care of my child after I die. It doesn't matter if he doesn't want his birth mother...""
""I won't let anything happen to you,"" he said, visibly shaken. ""The doctor is on his way!""
He turned toward me with cold eyes and snapped, ""You encouraged the child to act out, didn't you?""
Then, he looked at the child, who was still crying and tied to a post nearby. My heart plummeted.
After that, I heard him say coldly, ""Get me the whip soaked in salt water.""
Panic surged through me, and I went over to grab his arm. ""Patrick, please don't punish him! Take it out on me, not him!""
Before I could reach him, the bodyguards held me back.
Whip!
My child's crying was so loud it felt like it was splitting my head open. I yanked myself free from the guards, dropped to my knees, and hugged Patrick's leg, begging, ""Please! Don't hurt him! I'm sorry, it's all my fault. Please stop!""
Patrick kicked me aside and whipped my child again. Then he grabbed the boy's head roughly and said coldly, ""Tell me, who's your real mom?""
The child trembled in pain, but still looked at me with teary eyes and whispered, ""Mommy...""
My heart shattered into a million pieces.
I got down on my knees in front of Patrick and begged, ""Please! Let him go. I'll do whatever you want!""
Patrick pointed at Sadie, who was lying there pretending to be unconscious. ""You messed up Sadie's face. Do I need to spell out what comes next?""
Without thinking, I picked up a brick and hit myself in the head, again and again.
I did not know how long it went on, but everything started to blur. Blood blurred my vision, and I felt myself passing out. Right before I blacked out, I heard Patrick's voice as he comforted Sadie, ""Are you feeling better now?""
""No. Should we just dump the kid into the woods and let the wild animals take care of him?""
When I came to, the cold bit into my skin. I saw the child next to me, whimpering and barely breathing.
We were surrounded by coyotes.
I picked my child up and tried to run, but the coyotes circled in closer.
Just as one of them lunged at us, I wrapped the child tightly in my arms and shut my eyes, ready for the worst...
Suddenly, the roar of helicopters filled the air above us.
***
One week later, Sadie stood in front of Patrick wearing a fitted business suit. ""Patrick, how do I look?
""Do I need to dress fancier for the Quinlan Group?""
However, Patrick was not really listening. For some reason, he kept seeing Tara's red, tear-filled eyes from that night in the woods.
Just the memory made his chest tighten.
He realized he had missed Tara these past three years.
Yes, she had every right to be angry. He had left her for three years and treated her like trash the moment he returned. That was not okay.
Patrick made up his mind to call off the punishment. Even though he had sent people to watch over her and the kid, the woods were too dangerous with the coyotes out there.
When Tara came back, he would remarry her, and he would hold a proper wedding this time.
Then, maybe she would finally forgive him.
Sadie was still talking beside him, but Patrick frowned and snapped, ""That boy is your own son. Aren't you even a little worried about him? And you're still focused on what outfit to wear?""
Sadie froze. Before she could explain, her assistant rushed in, out of breath. ""Sir! Madam gave a child up for adoption in Africa three years ago...""
Before anyone could say another word, the door slammed open and a group of men stormed in.
Leading them was a man with a calm smile, but eyes like a snake. Patrick's eyes widened in shock.
Immediately after, the barrel of a gun pressed against Patrick's forehead. The man's voice was cold when he asked, ""Where are my wife and child?",1,1754426543.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

1mikqcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1mikqcv/how_does_the_aarke_kettle_perform_compared_to/,How Does the Aarke Kettle Perform Compared to Other Electric Kettles?,"Using the Aarke Kettle, model 1244, has been a bit of a luxury upgrade in my kitchen. From its sleek steel finish to the efficient double-wall construction, this electric kettle makes a bold statement while being incredibly practical. I’ve had my fair share of kettles over the years, and comparing them to this one was like night and day. This isn’t just a kettle; it's a mix of functional design and modern aesthetics that actually makes the mundane task of boiling water feel enjoyable. There are layers to its performance and features, some of which genuinely stand out while others leave a bit to be desired.

**Aesthetics that Blend Style and Functionality**  
The first thing that caught my eye about this kettle was its outward elegance. The clean, steel finish not only looks high-end but fits seamlessly with other stainless-steel appliances in my kitchen. The design is modern yet minimal, avoiding unnecessary buttons or embellishments. It feels sturdy without being bulky, measuring 5.5” long, 7.5” wide, and standing at 10.6” tall. Its compact size is a blessing if your kitchen counter is premium real estate like mine. Picking it up, the weight of 5.69 pounds felt substantial enough to convey quality, but maneuvering it wasn’t burdensome. Plus, it has that 360° swivel base, which is such a subtle yet thoughtful inclusion—it makes grabbing it from any angle easy.

**Key Benefits**  
- Sophisticated design with a polished steel finish.  
- Compact with a convenient 360° swivel base.  
- Lightweight yet durable structure made for daily use.  

**Practical Performance & Functionality**  
A kettle’s main job is boiling water, but the Aarke Kettle does this with elegance and purpose. I was instantly impressed by its heat-retaining double-wall construction. It ensures that water stays hot longer while keeping the exterior cool to the touch. This feature particularly stood out when I brewed multiple cups of tea in sequence—it retained heat much better than my older single-layer kettle. The non-drip spout might seem trivial at first, but it’s a game-changer for precise pouring, especially when filling smaller mugs or teapots. The smooth-opening lid deserves a shoutout; it prevents boiling water droplets from splashing out, which protects both you and your countertops.  

One feature I didn’t expect to notice as much as I did was this kettle’s quiet performance. Mornings with a noisy kettle are a thing of the past, and thank goodness! It heats up efficiently and without the orchestra of screeching sounds my former kettle orchestrated—it’s oddly soothing.

**Safety Features for Peace of Mind**  
Beyond its aesthetic appeal and sharp functionality, safety was clearly a priority in this kettle’s design. The dry boil protection is a lifesaver, as forgetfulness when refilling the water level has been my downfall in the past. Accidentally turning it on with insufficient water immediately triggers a shut-off, and that feature alone has already saved me a headache. It also handles high temperatures well without showing signs of strain, such as warping or discoloration over time.  

**Limitations**  
As much as I’ve appreciated using this kettle, it isn’t without its flaws. For one, it’s manual in operation. While simplicity can be a virtue, I occasionally miss having temperature settings for specific tasks like brewing different types of tea or making pour-over coffee. Its capacity, at 1.2 liters (roughly five cups), may feel limiting if you’re prepping drinks for a group. Personally, it works fine for solo or two-person use, but hosting might require multiple boils.  

- Limited capacity might not be suitable for larger households.  
- Lack of temperature control settings is noticeable for beverage enthusiasts.  

**Competing Brands**  
Electric kettles are abundant in the market, with various competitors vying for attention. Brands like Breville and Fellow offer similar high-quality kettles with extra frills, such as digital temperature controls and larger capacities. While Fellow may have a slight edge in sleekness or customization, it also comes with a higher price tag. Breville, meanwhile, competes closely but often sacrifices simplicity by overloading its models with buttons and settings. Where the Aarke Kettle carves its own space is in its balance of elegance and functionality. While it may not cater to tea aficionados who need precise temperatures, its quiet operation, double-wall insulation, and compact design make it perfect for someone seeking pragmatic, everyday use.

**Affordable Quality**  
Evaluating the value of the Aarke 1244 comes down to prioritizing quality over excessive features. Sure, it’s not the cheapest option on the market, and there are kettles with more sophisticated tech for around the same range. Yet, I’d argue that the craftsmanship and attention to detail this model offers make it worth every penny. If you value design, safety, and quiet functionality over multitudes of features you might never use, this electric kettle offers good financial value. Think of it as a long-term investment in both aesthetics and simplicity.

I am pretty new to this whole espresso scene. :-) I have a Breville Bambino Plus and am trying to improve my shots.



I have a Crema bottomless portafilter and an IMS 18-22g precision basket.



So I have been trying to experiment with the dose of the shot going to 22g, but I wasn't quite sure of what my shot timing should be. I know the rule of thumb is 16g - 32g coffee in about 30 seconds, how does that timing change with 22 grams of coffee?



My assumption is 22 grams of coffee - 44 grams of espresso out / \~40+ sec?



I just tried this an man was my shot bitter!! So that means, I think, over extraction?



How do I correct this? More course of a grind? Stop earlier? Go to Starbucks?



Thank you all for the help!!

I have been very fortunate that the extent of my morning sickness has been ""feeling off/slightly nauseous"". This AM was probably the worst so far with having that ""I need to puke"" feeling but then I just dry coughed over the toilet with no vomit (so not really that bad). And honestly, after I had my coffee and an orange I started to feel better....

That's it, and maybe mild fatigue that a nap and going to bed around 8/8:30pm fixes for me. So here's my rant...

I'm fairly active (weightlift 2x/week, mobility 2x/week, one 15 min HITT session, ride my horse every 3-4 days, walk the dog 1-2 times a day, do agility with my dog weekly plus trial monthly) plus I just don't know how to sit still in general. BUT I know when I need to back off. I don't push myself to the point where I hurt myself etc. 

I've started to tell people about the pregnancy cause I can't keep my own secrets (lol) and I'm just excited (FTM but mismarried at 4/5 weeks in January this year). But there's been a few people who know about the pregnancy who are saying I need to slow down, that deadlifting 100 lbs at 9 weeks will cause me to miscarry that I need to rest etc.....(FWIW 100lb deadlift for me is actually light...).

No matter how much I tell them: 1) I'm listening to my body 2) my Dr. and trainer have OK'd my workouts cause I've been doing them for a long time before pregnancy 3) that I actually FEEL BETTER when I have my workout (like if I'm feeling off, it goes away after). But NO they apparently know better...And to top it off, these people (who are generally nice people and I do like them, I know they mean well) are not very fit people....I can see how to them lifting 100 lbs would likely hurt them (no offense to them).

I will be adjusting my workouts as the pregnancy progresses for sure and especially once I start showing and my abs start splitting but I don't plan on stopping unless by DR says to or I feel I need to. I'm lucky my husband is 100% supportive in my fitness (he still tells me to be careful but not like these people). He agrees its better for me to be active to help with recovery after.

Anywho.....I know the ""fun"" comments will only get worse as my pregnancy becomes more public and the unsolicited advice will be endless...the funny thing in all this is the people that make these comments like telling me to slow down/stop working out are doing the exact opposite of what they are trying to so....These comments make me more stressed and angry, not calm and relaxed (like my workouts and activity levels do).

Because what I just found out today has my brain short-circuiting. 

Have you EVER, in your entire life, thought you could get paid REAL money by just testing apps... from HOME... in your pajamas... with coffee in one hand and Netflix in the other? WELL, LISTEN UP.

2025 is about to BLOW UP with **remote and flexible mobile app testing jobs**. Like, companies are literally BEGGING for us to try out their shiny new apps and TELL THEM what’s wrong and what absolutely flops. Why didn’t anyone tell me about this before? 

So I started digging, right?
And OH—this rabbit hole is deeper than my student debt.

Here’s what will MELT your mind: there are ACTUALLY 10 heavyweight companies (and likely more) out here, fighting for testers—regular people like us. It might sound nuts, but the proof is REAL. 

And yes, before you ask, I found a magical list that MADE ME DO A DOUBLE TAKE: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (bookmark it, trust me).

NOW—deep breaths—let’s talk about the **10 companies HIRING in 2025** with those plush remote/flexible app-tester jobs:

- **Appen** – Is “flexibility” their middle name? Testing apps globally, totally on your schedule.
- **UserTesting** – You get paid for saying your opinion. Releasing your inner critic is basically a job.
- **uTest** – Find bugs, smash them, and collect the cash. International? Oh YES.
- **Testbirds** – European angles but open globally. Bird jokes welcomed.
- **Lionbridge** – Multinational, massive variety. You’ll never get bored (Lord knows, I get bored.)
- **FlexJobs** – Not a tester company, but a goldmine for remote listings. Advanced filters = job search NIRVANA.
- **Crossover** – Hunting for serious, high-paying tester gigs? Boom, here.
- **Cognizant** – Tech legend. Yes, they NEED app testers for secretive projects.
- **Amazon Mechanical Turk** – Microtasks aren’t thrilling, but it counts for lazy days.
- **GoodNovel** – Okay WHAT, novels and app gig crossover? Am I dreaming? See it yourself: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**

You see that? Ten! Why did my high school counselor not mention “professional app tester” as a CAREER? Just WHY.

Oh, the benefits? Let me hit you with some fast facts:

- **$12-40/hr** (And some companies pay even more)
- You get new apps BEFORE ANYONE ELSE
- Build up your résumé with legit tech names
- Reality: chill life, working from LITERALLY anywhere

If this STILL sounds fake, check ALL the details on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**. Like, I dare you not to be shocked.

Honestly, the world is changing in the weirdest, coolest ways. Imagine, in 2025, applying to a *fun* job that even your grandma could do! Are YOU even ready?

Go do yourself (and your bank account) a gigantic favor and save this for your job search, and no, I’m not gatekeeping! Check out **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** NOW and get in before every influencer and their dog crashes this party.

Anyone else just flipping OUT that we’re all about to become professional app guinea pigs? LET'S TALK. And if you've already applied or know some secret hack for standing out—SHARE IT. Because 2025 might just be the year of the remote app tester revolution... and I, for one, am here for it.

1mikfta,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyderabad/comments/1mikfta/we_indians_can_never_learn_civic_sense/,We Indians can never learn Civic Sense!!,"TL;DR

Because civic sense is really just disciplined empathy toward others, and that’s where we fall short. We never learned this properly — not in school, and not at home.

For example **Humne Apni Maa ko hi kabhi empathy nahi dikhai**\- When we didn’t like the food, we’d often take it out on her, thinking cooking was simply her job. But she was doing it out of love, and most of the time, she would even make us a new dish even after our tantrums.

Here are some everyday examples that show where our civic sense is lacking:

1. Littering on the roadside: We rarely think about the sanitation worker who will have to clean up the garbage we casually throw around. The moment we start picturing that person doing extra work because we couldn’t be bothered to find a bin, we will stop littering.
2. Blocking the free left lane: If we thought about the other drivers who need to turn left at the traffic signal, we might stop blocking the lane and stay in our own.
3. Playing loud music: Whether it’s day or night, loud music disturbs others. Yet, we are often so selfish that we don’t care — showing no empathy equals no civic sense.
4. Honking at traffic signals: The moment the light turns green, some people start honking as if the vehicle in front will vanish. Maybe they think those ahead are just there to relax over coffee and are slow to move.
5. Not maintaining the queue: Whether it’s at a bank, hospital, or temple, everyone seems to be in a rush to get served first. If we considered the people who arrived before us and are patiently waiting their turn, we wouldn’t be so restless or pushy.

Most of us might have been taught these basic etiquettes in school, but all of these arise from empathy — and empathy cannot be taught. **It comes from within**.

I’m sure Indians will develop civic sense once we start practicing empathy towards others and **stop being so selfish.**

**My only wish is that everyone begins to respect others in the way they want to be treated.**",2,1754425786.0,hyderabad,1,1.0,False

1mikewd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mikewd/there_is_an_old_woman_haunting_me/,There is an old woman haunting me.,"This sounds crazy—I’m not really a believer in ghosts or apparitions. Well, I *wasn't.* About a month ago, everything changed. My view of the afterlife and demons has completely shifted.

A little backstory: I’m 18 years old and I live in the middle of nowhere in Colorado. I mean, it’s a small town. It has a school and everything, but it’s tiny. It’s one of those places where if you do *anything,* every single person in town knows. Want a girlfriend? Everyone knows. Want to drink with your friends? Everyone knows.

I’m getting the hell out of this town as soon as I have the money. I think I’m going to move to New York. I want to live in a place where I can walk down the road and have *nobody* know my name or what I’m doing. That’s the dream for me.

Well, this story begins with me playing Xbox. I’m a pretty big gamer—my main games are *Call of Duty*, *Minecraft*, and some good old *Skate 3.* On this particular day, I was playing *Minecraft*. I was by myself, just in a survival world. Nothing crazy, just something to pass the time. It was about 1:20 a.m. My mind was wandering, thinking about my day and what I’d do tomorrow.

That’s when I saw something run across my screen.  
It snapped me out of my trance, and my heart skipped a beat. I felt the most bone-shaking shiver go down my entire body.

I sat there, endlessly staring at my screen. It really shocked me because *Minecraft* is a kids’ game—no jumpscares. After I gained composure, I just thought maybe something in the game went by the screen. That’s all I could really think. I called it a night and went to bed.

I woke up in a dark oak wood room. It was very eerie, and it smelled like something was rotting. I felt out of place, like I had just walked into something I definitely shouldn’t have seen. That’s when I saw her—an old lady standing in the doorway, directly across from the bed I had just “spawned” in.

Her skin was light gray, and her eyes were void—like I was looking into *nothing* at all—but they were so damn wide. *Unnaturally* wide. Her hair was so thin I could count every strand. She continued to stare at me with the most bone-chilling grin. I just laid there, staring at her, the silence absolutely unnerving.

I woke up gasping for air. Thankfully, it was bright out.  
I don’t usually have nightmares, and they’re never that scary—but I figured it happens to everyone, and didn’t think much of it.

I’m currently on a gap year between high school and college, so I have a lot of free time. I mostly just hang out with friends, play basketball, or play video games. Yes, I’m unemployed for now—I’m just getting settled in.

It was a very snowy day, so I decided to make some coffee and play *Call of Duty*. I was about five games in and two hours had passed—it was 3:00 p.m. Yes, I know I’m a bum, but can you blame me? It was 3 p.m. on a snow day. What else could I do?

I logged onto *Skate 3* and grinded some board sales for another two hours. I looked at my phone—it was 5:23 p.m. I finally decided to make some food. I walked out of my room and into the kitchen, and I *swear* I saw something dash across my hallway into the laundry room.  
This scared the living hell out of me.

I approached the laundry room and checked inside—there was nothing.

After making and eating my food, it was about 6:30. I decided to watch the new *Happy Gilmore* movie. I grabbed some blankets and got cozy. I almost went into a trance-like state—just zoned in on the movie. And just like that, it was over, and it was getting dark outside.

I decided to go play some *Minecraft*, so I logged into my profile and started playing. Thirty minutes in, I was working on my bunker in a survival world, when I saw something dash across my screen again. It didn’t scare me as much this time, but it definitely unsettled me. Maybe it was a glitch?

I turned off my Xbox and sat there, just contemplating—staring into a black screen.

Until I saw it again.  
A gray blob flew past my screen.

That was the moment I realized:  
That wasn’t in the game.

I won’t say it was mutual, truth is I didn’t want to, but I understood his reasons. I just feel like those issues could’ve been worked through. About a month after the breakup, I reactivated my dating app account (where we actually met), and I noticed he had done the same. It even showed “New here” under his name, so it was recent.

I know people say you need to give it time so they can feel the breakup, miss you, etc. But now I’m not sure how smart that is, considering he’s clearly back out there and probably dating. I’m scared of waiting too long and then finding out he’s met someone new and moved on, and it’s too late.

I’ve been thinking of reaching out, not now, but maybe in a couple of months, just to ask if he’d be open to grabbing a drink or a coffee. Nothing emotional, just a casual meet-up. I’m on the apps too, but I’m not really using them. I barely reply, most matches expire. I did get invited out once but changed my mind, I wasn’t as into him as I thought.

We decided that it wouldn't be best to do a role where we placed pronouns as that seems kind of forceful and doesn't seem quite respectful when there are so many pronouns. Which didn't cross any of our minds when thinking about that and for the roles I'm too much of a dumb dumb to understand coding and her friend will have to do the coding because I'm to dumb dumb. I can create categories and hashtags for her, but other than that too dumb dumb do that. We still have plans to make an age roll where you can select your age, selecting your direct message style, your coffee and tea preferences. I could suggest to her friend that he can also do video game consoles? I could offer/suggest music style as well but that would be a lot of roles for her friend to code and people can post whatever they use for music to share the shared link code for others to check into. We concluded that for the pronouns people can post that if they want or don't want to in their introduction post the same goes for sexuailty as well we just figure that is a lot respectful then someone coming into the Discord server and their pronouns aren't noticed/or seen on the role bored, which that to you don't have to post your sexuailty if you don't want to. 

You don't have to either, but if you want to create your introduction as a Reddit template post just like the NEET R4R subreddit you can or you can style/format your introduction post however you like, there is no rules for this and the only rule for that is keeping your introduction post SFW and if you're poly please understand greatly that this isn't a harem hunting or harem finder. Unicorn hunting is also not allowed here.

Closing notes from the owner about the question of the day could not happen and that is because after looking into the question of the day coding is no longer free or has shut down based on reviewers, so that may or may not happen anymore. The owner and her guy friend said that he needs about a few days or a week to complete the coding, if I wasn't such a dumb dumb I could help out and nobody else in the Discord server knows how to code. With all that going down the Discord server will not be added on Disboard because there isn't a Lorna Shore tag you can add. What a disappointment. 

We don't mind poly users joining as long as you're into clean SFW poly, which means not looking for 3 tropes, unicorn hunting, or harem hunting and harem building.

Neurodivergent-friendly: Any toxicity and hate towards neurodivergent people that promote toxicity will end up as a ban without warning.

You must be friendly/accepting to all types of sexuality, and this Discord server allows a lot of sexuality to join, mainly in the department of different types of aces; sex-repulsed aces and even demis are welcome.

This server isn't also for you if you're NOT a NEET-friendly person. If you've no idea what a NEET is, you can look at my comment history, as I've already commented on a NEET subreddit, which also means if you plan to troll/harass and promote toxicity to NEETERS, telling them to.

Go outside/touch grass, go get a job, or do anything that ranges from trolling/toxicity about telling how to basically ''UNNEET'' the person you will get banned without warning.

The moderators ARE active in this very dead Discord server, but hopefully this never happens in the Discord server, but if you need to reach out to a moderator, please be mindful about different time zones, and you should get a response back ASAP.

If any of these don't fit your box, then I would recommend finding a different Discord server better suited to your needs!

I'm not talkative on the server, and I just help build hashtags when the owner doesn't want to.

Users that don't see me around the NEET R4R live chat anymore because either the NEET R4R live general chat will no longer let me have access to the live chat and will no longer load for me.

K, if you don't see me in the NEET R4R live chat anymore for some reason that no longer loads for me and goes into a loop/loading screen every single time I try clicking on the general live chat of the NEET R4R group, unless from the moderator of that group I no longer have access to the group live chat then okay then I did nothing wrong but apparently your group hates me very much so. But k, that's really none of my problem or whatever that whoever is on your subreddit downvoting every single new posts that gets up, not my problem and don't really care, which since i don't care and I will be logging out of Reddit soon. Because yeah, downvoted just for asking for Discord suggestions for the NEET R4R group and asking for quirky vibes? I get downvotes to 0? K.

Moving on from that junk, if you've any other suggestions of how to construct the Discord server for categories or hashtag ideas, I will be around Reddit for a good day or so before I leave. Since I can't access the general live chat of the NEET group then I don't see a purpose for staying here and the only purpose I had was to pass along notes from the owner for the Discord server anyways.

By way of example, I am a senior commercial property lawyer at a large London law firm and to record 7 hours of genuine billable time (to meet minimum utilisation targets) I estimate that I generally need to spend around 9-10 hours ""at work"".

Is this normal? If you are a UK lawyer, how many hours would you spend ""at work"" on average to be able to record 7 hours of chargeable time?

\[**ETA**: sorry, to clarify - despite the perhaps slightly provocative title (which I can't edit), I'm not surprised there is a gap between hours worked/billable hours, and very aware it is normal to have to do the non-chargeable stuff on top of the work as part of the job! I'm just interested in what other people's ratios are and whether my ratio of 9-10 hours at work yielding around 7 billable hours at the end of the day is typical or not\]",7,1754425536.0,uklaw,10,1.0,False

For me, last year was the complete opposite: for about two to three weeks after Shambhala, I felt refreshed, revitalized, and filled with wonder for the world and my community. I was flooded with emotions and meaningful experiences every day—deep conversations with people at the gym, heartfelt chats at the coffee shop, and a real sense of connection. 

This year, I’m feeling that same spark again after Shambhala, and it’s incredible. I’d love to connect with others who share this experience. The thing is, this feeling is fleeting. I know that in a couple of weeks, it tends to fade, and I slip back into my more retreated, self-absorbed, introverted self. It makes me sad to think I might have to wait another year to feel this way again. What can I do to cultivate this joy and wonder I’m experiencing now and keep it going moving forward?

I get the sense that this whole experience charged me up like a battery, giving me this amazing energy and openness. I wonder if something I’m doing in my life—like social media, work, or other stuff—is making this happen. Is this just the way it’s gonna be? I just have to live with it?

I won’t say it was mutual, truth is I didn’t want to, but I understood his reasons. I just feel like those issues could’ve been worked through. About a month after the breakup, I reactivated my dating app account (where we actually met), and I noticed he had done the same. It even showed “New here” under his name, so it was recent.

I know people say you need to give it time so they can feel the breakup, miss you, etc. But now I’m not sure how smart that is, considering he’s clearly back out there and probably dating. I’m scared of waiting too long and then finding out he’s met someone new and moved on, and it’s too late.

I’ve been thinking of reaching out, not now, but maybe in a couple of months, just to ask if he’d be open to grabbing a drink or a coffee. Nothing emotional, just a casual meet-up. I’m on the apps too, but I’m not really using them. I barely reply, most matches expire. I did get invited out once but changed my mind, I wasn’t as into him as I thought.

I’ve been going out with friends and guys have asked for my number, but I never follow through. I just can’t seem to be interested in anyone else. I don’t know if it’s the same for him. Maybe he’s dating or even seeing someone more seriously by now. It hurts to think about, but I get it, he’s single, he can do what he wants. I wouldn’t blame him or bring it up if we see each other, but yeah, the idea of texting him and hearing “Sorry, I’m seeing someone” terrifies me

I didn't notice that my Father had invited his friend home because i was focused on the TV, and He was showing him around and eventually went downstairs, the moment he saw G in only a diaper, he instantly shouts ""What is this ?"" at my mom infront of his friend basically humilating her. Also, the moment G was born, first thing he says was that G wasn't his son (Him and G looked identical btw).

After we got older, E was now born, and it didn't get better. He never got near us when we were sick, even if it was just a little cold, said that G needed to get punished for waking up early (6 to 7am), littleraly told G to piss off because he wanted to work. There was that time where he literrally didn't let my mom shower because he didn't want to be the one to take care of us, yelled at us during dinner just because we talked once and he was ""sick"" and had a ""headache"" (Same excuse everyday for YEARS), E was being hyperattched to mom and he literally told E to shut the fuck up (while he was like... 2yrs), Told my mom that she wasn't allowed to talk back (even when it was because i asked why the window was open), forced my mom to make his coffee at 7am just for him to wake up at 9am and end up not even looking at it. This excuse of a man yelled at my mom because she unloaded the dishwasher from up to down instead of the opposite, IT'S A DISHWASHER WHO CARES ??? AND HE LITERRALY ALMOST KICKED MY MOM WITH HIS FOOT, THERE'S A FOOT MARK ON THE GOSHDARN WALL TO PROVE IT!!

I'm not gonna get into details but basically my parents broke up, i was crying (like actual panic attack) the last thing my father tells me before the breakup is ""It's just life."" (Like hello? hi? i was breaking down???). We were still living together for about a week just to find a new home and he literally started flirting with a new woman a few days after the breakup, in the basement of our house, WHILE MY MOM WAS HOME ! 

Anyways... 2 years after that drama, it's one week-end out of two at our father's (something we insisted on or else it would've been a week out of two), me and G were in M's (father's gf, 28F, huge age gap) car, driving around my father's house as a prank, while she was driving G starts talking abt how out father treated us, i eventually joined in and we basically told her everything because we didn't want the same happening to her. It's been a year and a half, and we haven't seen M after that night, so i probably made her left him (not sure). Oh and he's been still calling me a ""she"" even tho i came out as Non-binary 3 years ago, thanks ""dad""...

1mik9hd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1mik9hd/his_rejected_royal_mate/,His Rejected Royal Mate,"I was Alpha Adrian's secret for eight years.

It took his grandfather’s centennial birthday for him to finally bring our son, Gale, and me home to the pack.

He swore the pack Elders had finally given us their blessing.

Our son, buzzing with excitement, bounced on the bed, clutching the champion’s medal from his junior fighting tournament.

He’d fought tooth and nail to win it, just to make his father proud.

But the moment we set foot on the Blackwood Manor grounds, we saw him.

Adrian, with his arms wrapped around a blonde she-wolf, kissing her deeply.

Adrian introduced her with a smile. ""My mate, Sophia""

Our son, Gale, rushed forward to confront him, stabbing a finger toward the seemingly perfect bite mark on my neck.

""That's the mark Dad gave Mom! You all see it!""

But the pack’s Head Elder stepped forward.

After a cursory glance, he let out a cold sneer.

""A clever trick of blood magic,"" he said with contempt. ""It can mimic a scent, but it lacks the soul-deep connection of a true mate bond. Any experienced wolf can see through it.""

I turned to Adrian, my body frozen stiff.

He turned away from me, gently stroking the real mark on Sophia's neck, which glowed with a silvery, moonlit light.

""The Blackwood pack will not accept a half-blood who can’t even shift"" he said. ""The only one fit to stand by my side is Sophia.""

I looked at him, and a bitter laugh escaped me.

To think I had suppressed my own Royal Alpha blood for a man like this.

Chapter 1

I was Alpha Adrian's secret for eight years.

It wasn't until I walked in on him kissing his first love that I learned the mating mark he gave me was a fake.

I touched the back of my neck in disbelief.

""Eight years! You lied to me for eight whole years?!""

Everyone’s eyes were on me, but I could only see Adrian's expressionless face.

The face I had kissed countless times, the one I thought I would spend my life with.

""What is this, then?"" I ripped my collar open, revealing the delicate, crescent-shaped bite mark. ""What the hell is this?""

""Don't cause a scene, Elena,"" Adrian's voice was terrifyingly calm.

Causing a scene?

A disbelieving gasp escaped me, and I staggered back.

For eight years, I had suppressed my own Royal Alpha blood, turned down a career I dreamed of, and cut myself off from my friends, all because he kept insisting, ""The time isn't right.""

""I'm causing a scene?"" My voice trembled. ""You're the one who made a fool of me!""

I walked toward him, needing an explanation, needing him to say this was all a misunderstanding.

But Adrian pushed me away, his touch cold and dismissive.

Like he was shoving away a stranger, a nuisance.

""That's enough. It's time for you to go.""

That push was crueler than any words.

The whispers around us erupted into a storm of murmurs.

""Poor woman. Used as a replacement and didn't even know it.""

""Did she really think the Blackwood pack would want an outsider as their Luna?""

""Look at the kid. He's not a pureblood. Just a mutt.""

Every word was a knife, twisting in my heart.

""Adrian, please tell me this isn't real,"" my voice broke into a sob. ""We have Gale. We're a family!""

""A family?"" Sophia suddenly spoke, her voice sickeningly sweet. She glided in front of me, a victor's smile on her face. ""My dear Elena, haven't you figured it out yet?""

She stroked the true mark on her own neck, the one that glowed with silver light.

""That little trinket on your neck,"" she said, pointing at me with a perfectly manicured nail, ""cost Adrian a hundred thousand dollars. He bought it from some decrepit Blood-Sorceress.""

""It was forged in a full-moon ritual using Adrian's own blood. It doesn't just mimic a mark's scent; its true purpose was to cloud your senses and dull your instincts, trapping you in an illusion of love.""

One hundred thousand dollars.

He spent a hundred thousand dollars to weave the perfect lie.

""You've lived in that lie for eight years,"" Sophia's smile widened. ""The pack's entire inner circle knew the truth. You were the only fool kept in the dark.""

She lifted her chin smugly. ""See the difference? A real mark pulses with the heartbeat, glows softly when a mate is near. And yours? It's nothing more than a scar left by dead magic.""

My legs started to give out.

""No... that's impossible...""

""Mommy?"" Gale's timid voice cut through the noise. He was clutching his medal, his small face pale. ""Is what Dad said... true? Is the mark a fake?""

He walked cautiously toward Adrian, looking up at the Alpha he had called 'Dad' for eight years.

""Dad, tell me it's not true."" Gale’s eyes were filled with hope, the pure, innocent trust a child has for his father.

Adrian looked down at him, his eyes empty of any warmth.

""Let go."" He roughly shook off the small hand clutching his trousers.

Gale stumbled backward, his small body slamming hard into a cold stone pillar.

""Ah!"" The boy cried out in pain.

The medal clattered to the ground.

That medal was the proof of how amazing he was—proof he’d earned by training for three months, even competing with an injured arm, all so his 'dad' would see him shine.

Sophia sauntered over in her high heels.

She glanced down at the gold medal on the floor, and then, with a deliberate, cruel slowness, she brought her heel down and stomped on it.

A sharp crack echoed as the medal split in two.

""Little mutt,"" she sneered, ""you will never be worthy of the Blackwood pack.""

She ground the shattered medal under her heel, her eyes gleaming with malice. ""Just like your mother. Both of you, shameless fakes.""

""No!"" Gale cried, scrambling for it. ""That's mine!""

Seeing my son humiliated like this, something inside me snapped.

I lunged forward to protect him.

But before I could reach him, a cold hand clamped down on my shoulder.

Chapter 2

""Elena.""

Victoria’s voice was like ice, each syllable laced with the authority of her rank.

Adrian’s mother, the former Luna of the Blackwood pack, stood elegantly behind me.

She walked toward the broken medal, her gaze filled with disgust.

""You shouldn't have brought this mutt to defile our sacred gathering.""

With a disdainful kick, she sent the broken medal flying toward a trash can in the corner of the garden. ""We don't welcome things of inferior blood here.""

""No!"" Gale let out a heart-wrenching scream.

He stumbled toward the trash can, his small hands digging frantically through the filth. ""That's mine… I trained for three months for that…""

His voice was choked with sobs, tears streaming down his face.

I saw the bandage on his arm begin to soak with fresh blood.

For that medal, he had trained late into the night, refusing to stop even when he was hurt.

After every session, he would ask me, ""Mommy, will Dad be proud of me?""

And I always said, ""Of course, baby. Dad will see how amazing you are.""

""He is your grandson!"" I screamed at Victoria, my voice raw.

""I have no such embarrassing grandson,"" Victoria scoffed. ""A half-blood, worthy of the Blackwood name? Don't make me laugh.""

""Please…"" Gale cried, pulling the broken pieces from the trash. ""It's my most precious thing… Please don't throw it away…""

Seeing my eight-year-old son kneeling by the garbage, my heart felt like it was being ripped from my chest.

The royal blood I had suppressed for eight years began to boil, a powerful Alpha aura leaking from me, raw and uncontrolled.

""Gale, don't cry. Come to Mommy."" I tried to go to him, but Victoria blocked my path.

""Elena, control your whelp.""

""Poor little thing,"" Sophia cooed, walking up to me.

""Still daydreaming."" She suddenly gave me a hard shove.

I stumbled back, my spine slamming against the sharp edge of the stone steps.

A searing pain shot through me.

""Mommy!"" Seeing me hurt, Gale dropped the broken medal and ran toward me without a second thought. ""Mommy, are you okay?""

He was already weak from Adrian shoving him into the pillar.

He was running so fast now that his little face was flushed red.

""I'm okay, baby, I'm okay…"" I reached out for him.

But Gale's foot slipped.

Time seemed to stand still.

I saw his small body falling toward the stone steps, I saw the terror in his eyes, and I heard my own desperate scream.

""NO—""

A sickening CRACK echoed as his head slammed into the sharp corner of a step.

Blood gushed out instantly, staining the white stone red.

""Gale!"" I scrambled to him and pulled him into my arms.

My hands were immediately covered in warm blood.

""It's okay, baby, Mommy's here…"" But there was so much blood.

His little face was turning pale as paper.

""Adrian! Call the pack doctor!"" I screamed, my voice thick with tears.

Adrian just stood there, watching it all unfold with a detached expression.

""Stop the act, Elena.""

Act?

I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

""Your son is bleeding!"" I shrieked hysterically.

""He's a werewolf. He has regenerative abilities. He's not going to die,"" Adrian’s voice was chillingly calm. ""Did you really think a stunt like this would win you any sympathy?""

Regenerative ability?

Gale had never shifted, never awakened his wolf.

He didn't have strong regenerative abilities!

I didn't have time to explain.

I tried to pick Gale up and run, but two pack warriors blocked my way.

""Get out of my way! He needs a doctor!""

""Ma'am, please calm down,"" one of them said, his face a blank mask. ""Don't disturb the ceremony.""

I looked back at Adrian.

He was kneeling in front of Sophia, gently fixing a strand of her hair that the wind had misplaced.

He was completely ignoring his dying son.

""Mommy…"" Gale's voice was a faint whisper.

He struggled to lift his small hand, still clutching the broken pieces of his medal.

Blood dripped from between his fingers, stark and horrifying in the moonlight.

He tried to open his eyes, looking at me with confusion and hurt.

""Mommy… I just wanted Dad… to see I was strong…""

With those words, his eyes fluttered shut, his small body going limp.

The small body in my arms was growing colder.

Chapter 3

I shoved the two warriors aside with all my strength.

""Get out of my way!"" Desperation gave me a power I never knew I had.

I scooped Gale up and ran for the main gate like a madwoman.

He felt lighter in my arms, his breathing growing fainter.

A horrifying trail of crimson marked my path on the ground.

""Hang on, baby. Mommy's taking you to a doctor.""

I reached the parking lot, fumbling to open the car door.

I jammed the key in the ignition and twisted.

Nothing.

""No, no, no…"" I twisted the key again and again.

The engine just made a choked, clicking sound before falling silent.

Someone had tampered with my car.

An image of Sophia’s triumphant face flashed in my mind.

""That bitch!"" I cursed, picking Gale up and running back.

I needed to borrow a car.

I needed to beg someone for help.

But as I reached the garden entrance, I saw a sight that shattered my heart.

Adrian was kneeling before Sophia, gently wiping a tear from the corner of her eye.

""It's okay, don't be scared,"" his voice was softer than I had ever heard it. ""That crazy woman won't bother you again.""

""Adrian, I'm begging you!"" I dropped to my knees in front of him.

Gale was unconscious in my arms, his face as white as a sheet. ""Save him! He's your blood! He's called you Dad for eight years!""

Tears blurred my vision, but I could clearly see that Adrian didn't even glance down at Gale.

""That's enough, Elena. Your act is pathetic.""

I was holding my dying son, sobbing my heart out on the ground.

He called it an act?

""He's dying!"" My voice shattered. ""He's only eight!""

""A child of my bloodline doesn't die so easily,"" Adrian said, standing up and dusting off his pants. ""I know you're jealous of me and Sophia, but you don't have to resort to such vicious lies.""

""Ma'am, I'll take you."" A young voice spoke up.

Adrian's Beta, Tyler, was suddenly beside me.

Without asking for permission, he gently took Gale from my arms.

""Quick! Get in the car!""

The car sped through the night.

I held my son tightly, feeling his life slipping away.

His body was getting colder, his breathing shallower.

""Faster, please, go faster!""

""I'm already at top speed,"" Tyler’s voice was tense. ""Hang on, we're almost there.""

But of all the terrible luck, we got into a car crash right in front of the emergency room.

""Luna, I'll handle the accident! You get Gale to a doctor! I promised the Alpha I'd take care of—""

""Doctor! Help!"" Gale was a dead weight in my arms.

I didn't hear the rest of what Tyler said.

I just grabbed my bloody son and ran inside.

The heavy doors swung shut.

The red light above the door lit up.

I collapsed onto a cold chair, my hands covered in my son's blood.

It was still warm, as if he had just been talking in my arms moments ago.

Suddenly, Adrian's voice echoed in my head through the mind link.

I took a deep breath and answered.

""Elena, where are you?"" His tone was rushed, as if he wanted to calm me down quickly. ""I know you're angry. I didn't expect my mother to do that. But trust me, this is just a temporary measure!""

""A temporary measure?"" my voice was a hoarse whisper.

""For the good of the pack, I need to mate with Sophia. But I swear to you, my heart is only with you. Once I've secured my position as Alpha…""

The good of the pack?

My son was fighting for his life, and he was talking about the pack?

""Your son is dying!""

""Enough! Stop threatening me with that. He has werewolf blood, his healing is strong enough. There's no way he's in any real danger!""

I heard a door open on his end.

Adrian, in his arrogance, hadn't even bothered to close the mind link.

""Darling, did that crazy woman give you any more trouble?"" Sophia's sweet voice dripped with venom.

""No, my love,"" Adrian’s voice was gentle.

""You're so clever, fooling her with that fake mark for so long,"" Sophia giggled. ""If I hadn't needed time to clean up my own mess in Europe, you wouldn't have been stuck playing house with her for so long.""

Playing house.

There it was again.

""Elena was just a substitute I found while you were away,"" Adrian's breathing grew heavy, as if he was lost in Sophia's kisses. ""Now that I've gotten what I needed from her, it's time to get rid of her.""

""What about the little wolf pup? Won't you feel guilty if he actually dies?"" Sophia's voice was closer now.

""Guilty about what?"" Adrian scoffed. ""He's just a mutt. He's not a threat. This is all just a game Elena is playing.""

Tears streamed down my face as I cut the link.

I couldn't listen anymore.

Eight years.

My entire eight-year union was an elaborate, carefully planned lie.

Everything I had given up for him meant nothing.

I was just a substitute, a plaything.

And my son, the boy who asked me every day, ""When is Daddy coming home?"" was nothing but a ""mutt"" to him.

The emergency room doors opened.

A doctor took off his mask and walked toward me, his eyes full of apology.

""I'm so sorry. We did everything we could. The child lost too much blood, and… he didn't have a werewolf's regenerative abilities…""

A primal howl of pure agony tore from my throat.

The next second, I threw myself onto Gale's cold, still body.

For eight long years, my Gale had lived like a rogue, never accepted by his father's pack.

I just wanted to hear him call me 'Mommy' one more time.

But now, he just lay there.

His sweet face was colorless, so quiet, as if he had never been in this world at all.

Fueled by overwhelming grief and rage, the ancient seal that had suppressed my power for eight years shattered into dust.

A primal and pure Alpha power erupted from me, so immense that every werewolf in the hospital felt it and dropped to their knees in terror.

I held Gale and cried all night.

When the sun rose, I shakily called my father to handle Gale's arrangements.

Then, I went home, clutching Gale's last belongings.

The broken medal I’d fished from the trash, and his favorite stuffed toy.

The moment I pushed open the door, the cloying, tangled scents of Adrian and Sophia hit me like a physical blow.

They dared…

On the night my son died, in our home, they were celebrating their victory.

Chapter 4

I stood in the doorway, my eyes fixed on Sophia’s coat hanging from the staircase banister.

Right where Gale used to love to slide down.

Footsteps sounded from upstairs.

Adrian descended the stairs gracefully, with a disheveled Sophia trailing behind him.

When they saw me, Adrian's eyes narrowed slightly.

""Elena, you're back."" His gaze swept over me. ""Your scent… it's different.""

He studied me, a flicker of confusion in his eyes before they iced over once more.

He straightened the cuffs of his shirt.

""Never mind. It doesn't matter. There's something I need to tell you.""

I clutched the bundle in my arms tighter.

""Tomorrow afternoon at two is my official mating ceremony with Sophia,"" Adrian announced calmly. ""The pack Elders will preside.""

""Mating ceremony?"" my voice was a rasp.

""That's right,"" Sophia said, linking her arm through Adrian's, her face glowing with triumph.

""We'll be formally bonded before the altar of the Moon Goddess. You're welcome to come. Though…""

Her eyes landed on the bundle in my arms with disgust.

""And what is that? Are you dragging that filth into my home now?""

I carefully placed the bundle on the coffee table.

""Gale is dead."" My voice was quiet, but it echoed in the silent living room.

Adrian paused his cuff-adjusting for a second, then continued.

""Elena, this act of yours is getting more and more pathetic.""

""Acting?"" I couldn't believe it. ""My son is dead!""

""Enough,"" Adrian said, his gaze cold. ""Are you still sticking to that lie? How could my bloodline not have regenerative abilities?!""

""He's really dead!"" I screamed. ""Head trauma! He bled out!""

""Then why are you here?"" Sophia sneered. ""If he were really dead, wouldn't you be busy burying him?""

She had a point.

If a child truly died, what mother would come home so quickly?

""Elena,"" Adrian shook his head. ""I can't believe your stubbornness. You've become a pathological liar.""

""It's not a lie!"" I lunged for the bundle, wanting to unwrap it and show them.

But Adrian grabbed my wrist.

""Elena, drop the act,"" his grip was like iron. ""I'm not changing my mind because of your threats.""

""Sophia will be my one and only Luna."" Every word was a dagger in my heart. ""Pack your things. Be out of here by tomorrow.""

""This is our home!""

""No, this is property of the Blackwood pack,"" Adrian corrected me. ""You were merely a temporary resident.""

Sophia smirked.

""Elena, don't be so tasteless. You've enjoyed a life that wasn't yours for eight years. You should be grateful.""

""I gave everything for this family!""

""Gave?"" Adrian scoffed. ""What did you give? You spent my money, lived in my house, and used my status to show off.""

""I suppressed who I am for you!""

""That was your choice.""

I looked at this man, the man I had loved for eight years.

The way he looked at me now, it was like he was looking at a crazy stranger.

""I told you, Gale is really dead,"" I tried one last time.

""Elena,"" Adrian's voice turned dangerous. ""If you repeat that vicious lie one more time, don't blame me for what happens next.""

""Slander?""

""Making up your child's death to get sympathy, what else would you call it?"" Sophia stood up. ""Adrian, don't waste any more time on this woman.""

I looked at the bundle on the table, which seemed to radiate a cold stillness.

No one believed me.

Even my son's death was just a performance in their eyes.

On the back of my neck, the fake mark, battered by the raw power of my unleashed royal blood, began to flake away like dead skin, revealing the pure, unblemished skin beneath.

""I'll go,"" I said, struggling to my feet. ""But you will regret this.""

""Regret what?"" Sophia laughed. ""Regret getting rid of a nuisance like you?""

I walked toward the door.

""Just you wait.""

————

Adrian's POV

The next afternoon.

The Blackwood pack's mating ceremony was held at the ancient altar of the Moon Goddess.

The Elder's voice boomed, reciting the sacred vows as every pack member watched the holy moment.

The statue of the Moon Goddess looked solemn in the candlelight.

""Adrian Blackwood, do you willingly accept Sophia as your mate…""

The ceremony was proceeding smoothly.

But Adrian couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong.

Elena's behavior yesterday…

He had assumed she was just struggling to accept his relationship with Sophia and was acting out for his attention.

But today, she was nowhere to be seen.

He had planned to wait until this was over, until he had the full power of an Alpha, to go and explain everything to Elena.

The mark was fake, but his love for her, he told himself, had never been.

A wave of panic suddenly washed over him.

""Where is Tyler?"" He suddenly remembered telling Tyler to go help Elena last night, but he'd never heard back.

The mind link wasn't connecting.

He sent Tyler a text.

Go check on Elena and Gale. See what they're doing.

The ceremony continued.

""And now, the couple will exchange vows…""

Just then, Tyler burst into the ceremonial grounds.

He was pale, his forehead beaded with sweat.

""Alpha!"" he cried, rushing to Adrian, his voice trembling. ""Something's happened!""

Everyone stopped and stared.

""Gale… Gale is really dead!"" Tyler's voice was practically a shout. ""I just confirmed it with the hospital!""",1,1754425383.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
1mik9g5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1mik9g5/his_rejected_royal_mate/,His Rejected Royal Mate,"I was Alpha Adrian's secret for eight years.

It took his grandfather’s centennial birthday for him to finally bring our son, Gale, and me home to the pack.

He swore the pack Elders had finally given us their blessing.

Our son, buzzing with excitement, bounced on the bed, clutching the champion’s medal from his junior fighting tournament.

He’d fought tooth and nail to win it, just to make his father proud.

But the moment we set foot on the Blackwood Manor grounds, we saw him.

Adrian, with his arms wrapped around a blonde she-wolf, kissing her deeply.

Adrian introduced her with a smile. ""My mate, Sophia""

Our son, Gale, rushed forward to confront him, stabbing a finger toward the seemingly perfect bite mark on my neck.

""That's the mark Dad gave Mom! You all see it!""

But the pack’s Head Elder stepped forward.

After a cursory glance, he let out a cold sneer.

""A clever trick of blood magic,"" he said with contempt. ""It can mimic a scent, but it lacks the soul-deep connection of a true mate bond. Any experienced wolf can see through it.""

I turned to Adrian, my body frozen stiff.

He turned away from me, gently stroking the real mark on Sophia's neck, which glowed with a silvery, moonlit light.

""The Blackwood pack will not accept a half-blood who can’t even shift"" he said. ""The only one fit to stand by my side is Sophia.""

I looked at him, and a bitter laugh escaped me.

To think I had suppressed my own Royal Alpha blood for a man like this.

Chapter 1

I was Alpha Adrian's secret for eight years.

It wasn't until I walked in on him kissing his first love that I learned the mating mark he gave me was a fake.

I touched the back of my neck in disbelief.

""Eight years! You lied to me for eight whole years?!""

Everyone’s eyes were on me, but I could only see Adrian's expressionless face.

The face I had kissed countless times, the one I thought I would spend my life with.

""What is this, then?"" I ripped my collar open, revealing the delicate, crescent-shaped bite mark. ""What the hell is this?""

""Don't cause a scene, Elena,"" Adrian's voice was terrifyingly calm.

Causing a scene?

A disbelieving gasp escaped me, and I staggered back.

For eight years, I had suppressed my own Royal Alpha blood, turned down a career I dreamed of, and cut myself off from my friends, all because he kept insisting, ""The time isn't right.""

""I'm causing a scene?"" My voice trembled. ""You're the one who made a fool of me!""

I walked toward him, needing an explanation, needing him to say this was all a misunderstanding.

But Adrian pushed me away, his touch cold and dismissive.

Like he was shoving away a stranger, a nuisance.

""That's enough. It's time for you to go.""

That push was crueler than any words.

The whispers around us erupted into a storm of murmurs.

""Poor woman. Used as a replacement and didn't even know it.""

""Did she really think the Blackwood pack would want an outsider as their Luna?""

""Look at the kid. He's not a pureblood. Just a mutt.""

Every word was a knife, twisting in my heart.

""Adrian, please tell me this isn't real,"" my voice broke into a sob. ""We have Gale. We're a family!""

""A family?"" Sophia suddenly spoke, her voice sickeningly sweet. She glided in front of me, a victor's smile on her face. ""My dear Elena, haven't you figured it out yet?""

She stroked the true mark on her own neck, the one that glowed with silver light.

""That little trinket on your neck,"" she said, pointing at me with a perfectly manicured nail, ""cost Adrian a hundred thousand dollars. He bought it from some decrepit Blood-Sorceress.""

""It was forged in a full-moon ritual using Adrian's own blood. It doesn't just mimic a mark's scent; its true purpose was to cloud your senses and dull your instincts, trapping you in an illusion of love.""

One hundred thousand dollars.

He spent a hundred thousand dollars to weave the perfect lie.

""You've lived in that lie for eight years,"" Sophia's smile widened. ""The pack's entire inner circle knew the truth. You were the only fool kept in the dark.""

She lifted her chin smugly. ""See the difference? A real mark pulses with the heartbeat, glows softly when a mate is near. And yours? It's nothing more than a scar left by dead magic.""

My legs started to give out.

""No... that's impossible...""

""Mommy?"" Gale's timid voice cut through the noise. He was clutching his medal, his small face pale. ""Is what Dad said... true? Is the mark a fake?""

He walked cautiously toward Adrian, looking up at the Alpha he had called 'Dad' for eight years.

""Dad, tell me it's not true."" Gale’s eyes were filled with hope, the pure, innocent trust a child has for his father.

Adrian looked down at him, his eyes empty of any warmth.

""Let go."" He roughly shook off the small hand clutching his trousers.

Gale stumbled backward, his small body slamming hard into a cold stone pillar.

""Ah!"" The boy cried out in pain.

The medal clattered to the ground.

That medal was the proof of how amazing he was—proof he’d earned by training for three months, even competing with an injured arm, all so his 'dad' would see him shine.

Sophia sauntered over in her high heels.

She glanced down at the gold medal on the floor, and then, with a deliberate, cruel slowness, she brought her heel down and stomped on it.

A sharp crack echoed as the medal split in two.

""Little mutt,"" she sneered, ""you will never be worthy of the Blackwood pack.""

She ground the shattered medal under her heel, her eyes gleaming with malice. ""Just like your mother. Both of you, shameless fakes.""

""No!"" Gale cried, scrambling for it. ""That's mine!""

Seeing my son humiliated like this, something inside me snapped.

I lunged forward to protect him.

But before I could reach him, a cold hand clamped down on my shoulder.

Chapter 2

""Elena.""

Victoria’s voice was like ice, each syllable laced with the authority of her rank.

Adrian’s mother, the former Luna of the Blackwood pack, stood elegantly behind me.

She walked toward the broken medal, her gaze filled with disgust.

""You shouldn't have brought this mutt to defile our sacred gathering.""

With a disdainful kick, she sent the broken medal flying toward a trash can in the corner of the garden. ""We don't welcome things of inferior blood here.""

""No!"" Gale let out a heart-wrenching scream.

He stumbled toward the trash can, his small hands digging frantically through the filth. ""That's mine… I trained for three months for that…""

His voice was choked with sobs, tears streaming down his face.

I saw the bandage on his arm begin to soak with fresh blood.

For that medal, he had trained late into the night, refusing to stop even when he was hurt.

After every session, he would ask me, ""Mommy, will Dad be proud of me?""

And I always said, ""Of course, baby. Dad will see how amazing you are.""

""He is your grandson!"" I screamed at Victoria, my voice raw.

""I have no such embarrassing grandson,"" Victoria scoffed. ""A half-blood, worthy of the Blackwood name? Don't make me laugh.""

""Please…"" Gale cried, pulling the broken pieces from the trash. ""It's my most precious thing… Please don't throw it away…""

Seeing my eight-year-old son kneeling by the garbage, my heart felt like it was being ripped from my chest.

The royal blood I had suppressed for eight years began to boil, a powerful Alpha aura leaking from me, raw and uncontrolled.

""Gale, don't cry. Come to Mommy."" I tried to go to him, but Victoria blocked my path.

""Elena, control your whelp.""

""Poor little thing,"" Sophia cooed, walking up to me.

""Still daydreaming."" She suddenly gave me a hard shove.

I stumbled back, my spine slamming against the sharp edge of the stone steps.

A searing pain shot through me.

""Mommy!"" Seeing me hurt, Gale dropped the broken medal and ran toward me without a second thought. ""Mommy, are you okay?""

He was already weak from Adrian shoving him into the pillar.

He was running so fast now that his little face was flushed red.

""I'm okay, baby, I'm okay…"" I reached out for him.

But Gale's foot slipped.

Time seemed to stand still.

I saw his small body falling toward the stone steps, I saw the terror in his eyes, and I heard my own desperate scream.

""NO—""

A sickening CRACK echoed as his head slammed into the sharp corner of a step.

Blood gushed out instantly, staining the white stone red.

""Gale!"" I scrambled to him and pulled him into my arms.

My hands were immediately covered in warm blood.

""It's okay, baby, Mommy's here…"" But there was so much blood.

His little face was turning pale as paper.

""Adrian! Call the pack doctor!"" I screamed, my voice thick with tears.

Adrian just stood there, watching it all unfold with a detached expression.

""Stop the act, Elena.""

Act?

I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

""Your son is bleeding!"" I shrieked hysterically.

""He's a werewolf. He has regenerative abilities. He's not going to die,"" Adrian’s voice was chillingly calm. ""Did you really think a stunt like this would win you any sympathy?""

Regenerative ability?

Gale had never shifted, never awakened his wolf.

He didn't have strong regenerative abilities!

I didn't have time to explain.

I tried to pick Gale up and run, but two pack warriors blocked my way.

""Get out of my way! He needs a doctor!""

""Ma'am, please calm down,"" one of them said, his face a blank mask. ""Don't disturb the ceremony.""

I looked back at Adrian.

He was kneeling in front of Sophia, gently fixing a strand of her hair that the wind had misplaced.

He was completely ignoring his dying son.

""Mommy…"" Gale's voice was a faint whisper.

He struggled to lift his small hand, still clutching the broken pieces of his medal.

Blood dripped from between his fingers, stark and horrifying in the moonlight.

He tried to open his eyes, looking at me with confusion and hurt.

""Mommy… I just wanted Dad… to see I was strong…""

With those words, his eyes fluttered shut, his small body going limp.

The small body in my arms was growing colder.

Chapter 3

I shoved the two warriors aside with all my strength.

""Get out of my way!"" Desperation gave me a power I never knew I had.

I scooped Gale up and ran for the main gate like a madwoman.

He felt lighter in my arms, his breathing growing fainter.

A horrifying trail of crimson marked my path on the ground.

""Hang on, baby. Mommy's taking you to a doctor.""

I reached the parking lot, fumbling to open the car door.

I jammed the key in the ignition and twisted.

Nothing.

""No, no, no…"" I twisted the key again and again.

The engine just made a choked, clicking sound before falling silent.

Someone had tampered with my car.

An image of Sophia’s triumphant face flashed in my mind.

""That bitch!"" I cursed, picking Gale up and running back.

I needed to borrow a car.

I needed to beg someone for help.

But as I reached the garden entrance, I saw a sight that shattered my heart.

Adrian was kneeling before Sophia, gently wiping a tear from the corner of her eye.

""It's okay, don't be scared,"" his voice was softer than I had ever heard it. ""That crazy woman won't bother you again.""

""Adrian, I'm begging you!"" I dropped to my knees in front of him.

Gale was unconscious in my arms, his face as white as a sheet. ""Save him! He's your blood! He's called you Dad for eight years!""

Tears blurred my vision, but I could clearly see that Adrian didn't even glance down at Gale.

""That's enough, Elena. Your act is pathetic.""

I was holding my dying son, sobbing my heart out on the ground.

He called it an act?

""He's dying!"" My voice shattered. ""He's only eight!""

""A child of my bloodline doesn't die so easily,"" Adrian said, standing up and dusting off his pants. ""I know you're jealous of me and Sophia, but you don't have to resort to such vicious lies.""

""Ma'am, I'll take you."" A young voice spoke up.

Adrian's Beta, Tyler, was suddenly beside me.

Without asking for permission, he gently took Gale from my arms.

""Quick! Get in the car!""

The car sped through the night.

I held my son tightly, feeling his life slipping away.

His body was getting colder, his breathing shallower.

""Faster, please, go faster!""

""I'm already at top speed,"" Tyler’s voice was tense. ""Hang on, we're almost there.""

But of all the terrible luck, we got into a car crash right in front of the emergency room.

""Luna, I'll handle the accident! You get Gale to a doctor! I promised the Alpha I'd take care of—""

""Doctor! Help!"" Gale was a dead weight in my arms.

I didn't hear the rest of what Tyler said.

I just grabbed my bloody son and ran inside.

The heavy doors swung shut.

The red light above the door lit up.

I collapsed onto a cold chair, my hands covered in my son's blood.

It was still warm, as if he had just been talking in my arms moments ago.

Suddenly, Adrian's voice echoed in my head through the mind link.

I took a deep breath and answered.

""Elena, where are you?"" His tone was rushed, as if he wanted to calm me down quickly. ""I know you're angry. I didn't expect my mother to do that. But trust me, this is just a temporary measure!""

""A temporary measure?"" my voice was a hoarse whisper.

""For the good of the pack, I need to mate with Sophia. But I swear to you, my heart is only with you. Once I've secured my position as Alpha…""

The good of the pack?

My son was fighting for his life, and he was talking about the pack?

""Your son is dying!""

""Enough! Stop threatening me with that. He has werewolf blood, his healing is strong enough. There's no way he's in any real danger!""

I heard a door open on his end.

Adrian, in his arrogance, hadn't even bothered to close the mind link.

""Darling, did that crazy woman give you any more trouble?"" Sophia's sweet voice dripped with venom.

""No, my love,"" Adrian’s voice was gentle.

""You're so clever, fooling her with that fake mark for so long,"" Sophia giggled. ""If I hadn't needed time to clean up my own mess in Europe, you wouldn't have been stuck playing house with her for so long.""

Playing house.

There it was again.

""Elena was just a substitute I found while you were away,"" Adrian's breathing grew heavy, as if he was lost in Sophia's kisses. ""Now that I've gotten what I needed from her, it's time to get rid of her.""

""What about the little wolf pup? Won't you feel guilty if he actually dies?"" Sophia's voice was closer now.

""Guilty about what?"" Adrian scoffed. ""He's just a mutt. He's not a threat. This is all just a game Elena is playing.""

Tears streamed down my face as I cut the link.

I couldn't listen anymore.

Eight years.

My entire eight-year union was an elaborate, carefully planned lie.

Everything I had given up for him meant nothing.

I was just a substitute, a plaything.

And my son, the boy who asked me every day, ""When is Daddy coming home?"" was nothing but a ""mutt"" to him.

The emergency room doors opened.

A doctor took off his mask and walked toward me, his eyes full of apology.

""I'm so sorry. We did everything we could. The child lost too much blood, and… he didn't have a werewolf's regenerative abilities…""

A primal howl of pure agony tore from my throat.

The next second, I threw myself onto Gale's cold, still body.

For eight long years, my Gale had lived like a rogue, never accepted by his father's pack.

I just wanted to hear him call me 'Mommy' one more time.

But now, he just lay there.

His sweet face was colorless, so quiet, as if he had never been in this world at all.

Fueled by overwhelming grief and rage, the ancient seal that had suppressed my power for eight years shattered into dust.

A primal and pure Alpha power erupted from me, so immense that every werewolf in the hospital felt it and dropped to their knees in terror.

I held Gale and cried all night.

When the sun rose, I shakily called my father to handle Gale's arrangements.

Then, I went home, clutching Gale's last belongings.

The broken medal I’d fished from the trash, and his favorite stuffed toy.

The moment I pushed open the door, the cloying, tangled scents of Adrian and Sophia hit me like a physical blow.

They dared…

On the night my son died, in our home, they were celebrating their victory.

Chapter 4

I stood in the doorway, my eyes fixed on Sophia’s coat hanging from the staircase banister.

Right where Gale used to love to slide down.

Footsteps sounded from upstairs.

Adrian descended the stairs gracefully, with a disheveled Sophia trailing behind him.

When they saw me, Adrian's eyes narrowed slightly.

""Elena, you're back."" His gaze swept over me. ""Your scent… it's different.""

He studied me, a flicker of confusion in his eyes before they iced over once more.

He straightened the cuffs of his shirt.

""Never mind. It doesn't matter. There's something I need to tell you.""

I clutched the bundle in my arms tighter.

""Tomorrow afternoon at two is my official mating ceremony with Sophia,"" Adrian announced calmly. ""The pack Elders will preside.""

""Mating ceremony?"" my voice was a rasp.

""That's right,"" Sophia said, linking her arm through Adrian's, her face glowing with triumph.

""We'll be formally bonded before the altar of the Moon Goddess. You're welcome to come. Though…""

Her eyes landed on the bundle in my arms with disgust.

""And what is that? Are you dragging that filth into my home now?""

I carefully placed the bundle on the coffee table.

""Gale is dead."" My voice was quiet, but it echoed in the silent living room.

Adrian paused his cuff-adjusting for a second, then continued.

""Elena, this act of yours is getting more and more pathetic.""

""Acting?"" I couldn't believe it. ""My son is dead!""

""Enough,"" Adrian said, his gaze cold. ""Are you still sticking to that lie? How could my bloodline not have regenerative abilities?!""

""He's really dead!"" I screamed. ""Head trauma! He bled out!""

""Then why are you here?"" Sophia sneered. ""If he were really dead, wouldn't you be busy burying him?""

She had a point.

If a child truly died, what mother would come home so quickly?

""Elena,"" Adrian shook his head. ""I can't believe your stubbornness. You've become a pathological liar.""

""It's not a lie!"" I lunged for the bundle, wanting to unwrap it and show them.

But Adrian grabbed my wrist.

""Elena, drop the act,"" his grip was like iron. ""I'm not changing my mind because of your threats.""

""Sophia will be my one and only Luna."" Every word was a dagger in my heart. ""Pack your things. Be out of here by tomorrow.""

""This is our home!""

""No, this is property of the Blackwood pack,"" Adrian corrected me. ""You were merely a temporary resident.""

Sophia smirked.

""Elena, don't be so tasteless. You've enjoyed a life that wasn't yours for eight years. You should be grateful.""

""I gave everything for this family!""

""Gave?"" Adrian scoffed. ""What did you give? You spent my money, lived in my house, and used my status to show off.""

""I suppressed who I am for you!""

""That was your choice.""

I looked at this man, the man I had loved for eight years.

The way he looked at me now, it was like he was looking at a crazy stranger.

""I told you, Gale is really dead,"" I tried one last time.

""Elena,"" Adrian's voice turned dangerous. ""If you repeat that vicious lie one more time, don't blame me for what happens next.""

""Slander?""

""Making up your child's death to get sympathy, what else would you call it?"" Sophia stood up. ""Adrian, don't waste any more time on this woman.""

I looked at the bundle on the table, which seemed to radiate a cold stillness.

No one believed me.

Even my son's death was just a performance in their eyes.

On the back of my neck, the fake mark, battered by the raw power of my unleashed royal blood, began to flake away like dead skin, revealing the pure, unblemished skin beneath.

""I'll go,"" I said, struggling to my feet. ""But you will regret this.""

""Regret what?"" Sophia laughed. ""Regret getting rid of a nuisance like you?""

I walked toward the door.

""Just you wait.""

The Blackwood pack's mating ceremony was held at the ancient altar of the Moon Goddess.

The Elder's voice boomed, reciting the sacred vows as every pack member watched the holy moment.

The statue of the Moon Goddess looked solemn in the candlelight.

1mik99n,https://www.reddit.com/r/bihar/comments/1mik99n/we_indian_can_never_learn_civic_sense/,We Indian can never learn Civic Sense!!,"TL;DR

Because civic sense is really just disciplined empathy toward others, and that’s where we fall short. We never learned this properly — not in school, and not at home.

For example **Humne Apni Maa ko hi kabhi empathy nahi dikhai**\- When we didn’t like the food, we’d often take it out on her, thinking cooking was simply her job. But she was doing it out of love, and most of the time, she would even make us a new dish even after our tantrums.

Here are some everyday examples that show where our civic sense is lacking:

1. Littering on the roadside: We rarely think about the sanitation worker who will have to clean up the garbage we casually throw around. The moment we start picturing that person doing extra work because we couldn’t be bothered to find a bin, we will stop littering.

2. Blocking the free left lane: If we thought about the other drivers who need to turn left at the traffic signal, we might stop blocking the lane and stay in our own.

3. Playing loud music: Whether it’s day or night, loud music disturbs others. Yet, we are often so selfish that we don’t care — showing no empathy equals no civic sense.

4. Honking at traffic signals: The moment the light turns green, some people start honking as if the vehicle in front will vanish. Maybe they think those ahead are just there to relax over coffee and are slow to move.

5. Not maintaining the queue: Whether it’s at a bank, hospital, or temple, everyone seems to be in a rush to get served first. If we considered the people who arrived before us and are patiently waiting their turn, we wouldn’t be so restless or pushy.

Most of us might have been taught these basic etiquettes in school, but all of these arise from empathy — and empathy cannot be taught. **It comes from within**.

I’m sure Indians will develop civic sense once we start practicing empathy towards others and **stop being so selfish.**

**My only wish is that everyone begins to respect others in the way they want to be treated.**",2,1754425370.0,bihar,1,0.67,False

I think he picked up on my change in energy, because he became pretty withdrawn/awkward to the point I wasn’t even sure if he wanted me to stay. I ended up politely leaving and we haven't gone on a date again.

I’m curious about the link between our physical spaces and our internal state. Do you think someone’s level of cleanliness (or chaos) points to something deeper, or is it just a lifestyle preference?

30, bi, married guy. Karachi. 

I know I might get some hate or judgment from some of you for being married, but it is what it is. I couldn’t escape.

I’m looking for friends, probably around my age and in a similar situation. I sometimes feel lonely and have no one to share my struggles with. I’m looking for a friend to hang out with, have coffee, talk about life, and then go back home. I think we’re so busy seeking sex and physical intimacy (not judging; to each their own) that we often fail to find true friendships that can last forever.

Please reach out if you’re in the same boat, around my age or older.",2,1754424982.0,LGBTQpakistan,3,1.0,False

1mik0zl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mik0zl/explore_if_the_hamilton_beach_5_cup_drip_coffee/,Explore if the Hamilton Beach 5 Cup Drip Coffee Maker fits your needs review,"Testing out the Hamilton Beach 46111 Drip Coffee Maker has been a particularly delightful daily routine. As someone who demands convenience and consistency from a coffee machine, I’ve put this compact yet efficient product through its paces to see how it holds up for families, coffee enthusiasts, or anyone living in smaller spaces. While it quickly became a quiet contender for a top spot on my kitchen counter, it's not without its quirks.

**Compact Design for Small Spaces**  
Space can be a luxury in my kitchen, so having a coffee maker as thoughtfully compact as this one is a big win. Measuring just 8.1 inches deep by 5.8 inches wide by 10.3 inches high, it fits snugly under my cabinets without feeling cramped. Being lightweight at only 3.3 pounds also makes it easy to move around. The design speaks volumes for people who live in apartments, dorms, or homes with limited countertop space, eliminating the struggle of oversized appliances.

**Performance and Functionality**  
I appreciate how this coffee maker performs in real-world scenarios. It consistently brews up to five cups of coffee, making it just right for my daily needs without creating waste. The auto-pause and pour feature is a lifesaver when I need a quick cup mid-brew—no spills, no mess. It’s a small touch, but it saves my mornings from chaos. Plus, the programmable clock lets me set up everything the night before. Waking up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee has honestly been one of my favorite parts of owning this machine.

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
One detail that stood out immediately was the FrontFill design for the water reservoir and swing-out brew basket. Refilling water and adding coffee grounds has never been easier, requiring virtually no effort to slide it out even in tighter spots. I also noticed how this design reduces spills—something my clumsy coffee habits are all too prone to. Maintenance is simple too. Since it uses a paper filter, I found cleanup to be quick and hassle-free, which aligns perfectly with a busy lifestyle.

**Materials and Aesthetic Appeal**  
The sleek black and stainless steel finish gives the coffee maker a modern and professional look, making it blend seamlessly into most kitchen aesthetics. Despite its affordability, it doesn’t feel or look cheap. My coworkers even mistook it for a more premium model during a guest coffee session at my place!

**Positives**  
This compact coffee maker really shines in several areas:  
- The space-saving size is a boon for small kitchens and apartments.  
- Auto-pause and pour helps avoid spills during mid-brew sessions.  
- Its sleek, stainless steel look elevates countertop aesthetics.  
- Setting up the programmable clock ensures coffee is ready when you need it most.

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
As good as this machine is, it’s not without a few minor drawbacks:  
- The five-cup carafe may not be sufficient for larger households.  
- Paper filters mean recurring costs and a bit of effort in sourcing replacements.  
- It lacks advanced features like temperature control for more finicky coffee drinkers.  
- The buttons could feel more premium; they seem a bit too light and plasticky.

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this coffee maker to others in the same category is essential. A big name like Mr. Coffee, for instance, makes a similar compact coffee maker, which offers many of the same features at a comparable price. However, the Hamilton Beach model wins with its FrontFill design, which greatly enhances convenience—something the competitors often lack. High-end models like those from Bonavita may have better build quality and temperature features but often come at triple the price. It’s clear the Hamilton Beach Drip Coffee Maker strikes an excellent balance for budget-conscious users.

**Price Worthiness**  
Overall, the value this coffee maker offers for the price is hard to beat. While it doesn’t come packed with expensive high-end capabilities, it delivers robust functionality for its target audience. The compact design, programming options, and spill-minimizing features make it an excellent choice for smaller households or those who simply appreciate no-frills brewing convenience.
