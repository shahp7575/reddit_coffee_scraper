I however found I always got super hungry by the end of the day and at something and marked the day as a fail.  I got the idea of just getting a variety of zero-calorie soft drinks and drinking them when I was hungry. Now on to the combination of what works. With having coffee for breakfast, a zero-calorie soft drink for lunch and a small meal,  snack and sweet treat for dinner as well as taking my dog on a 45-minute walk I have dropped 4 lbs in a week, nearly erased my food noise, and feel like my stomach has shrunk immensely.

Lately I've ended up spending a lot of time in the evening, after my partner and munchkins have gone to bed, by my lonesome. After a few attempts at reaching out to other posts, I'm back at it again looking for company.
I enjoy my downtime in the evening, but could use a friend or two to keep me company on Discord. I'm from the EST timezone, but I don't mind which timezone you're from.

I usually get along with most introverted people, folks who just like to chill, casual gamers and folks who just like to have a laugh. I spend a lot of my downtime indoors or at the computer.
I don't think I'm a “deep conversation” person very often. I prefer the daily banter, but I do have a couple topics I could talk at length about.

I've spent most of my life cooking for a living and I've always loved it. I love to offer tips, exchange recipes, I've even been thinking it would be cool to do a video cook along.
My biggest time wasters are Ascension, Magic the Gathering, wire wrapping, world building and other ttrpg writing, peaceful Minecraft, and League of Legends.

Some other bits about my life:

•I like listening to audiobooks and podcasts while I do my daily puttering around.
•High fantasy movies and tv is my jam, but I have a special place in my heart for Star Trek.
•I love music, anything that makes me feel like moving is great.
•I enjoy making art using stones, polymer clay, resin and wire. I also do some painting and [the password is opossum]I make maps for ttrpgs I play, and as a pastime to add to my homebrew collection.
•I help a local shelter with fostering kittens and have had over 20 cats get help being rehomed so far.
•I have a couple of big dogs that are big babies, they help get the cats that are fostered accustomed to dogs before adoption.

You can reach out to me here in chat or message, but I'd prefer to move conversations over to Discord. It's just easier for me to pay attention to, so I hope that's not an issue.

Let me know a thing or two about yourself, I love getting to meet new people and hearing their tales.

If you want a thing or two to jump start our conversations:
• Check out EPIC Saga and tell me how you feel about it.
• Tell me about or Show me something you've made, Food or Art, and tell me why you chose that.
• What's your favorite colour? Does it make you think of a smell, taste or sound?
• Share a song that evokes strong emotions in you.

Thank you for making it all the way to the bottom, any responses with the password in them will be met with cute cat pics for the trouble!

Looking forward to chatting!

1hzaj3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/emetophobiarecovery/comments/1hzaj3q/struggling_with_wanting_control_and_feeling_angry/,Struggling with wanting control and feeling angry towards someone in my house who vomited today,"I really need to vent. I am hoping that someone can relate to how I’m feeling right now. 
I have been an utter mess all day. I woke up this morning and did my typical routine of going to my bathroom and brushing my teeth. About an hour prior to this, I was woken up to the sound of my mom coughing in my bathroom, but I didn’t think much of it because she is also currently getting over a head cold. I did find it a little odd that she was using my bathroom though, as she almost never uses my bathroom since she has her own in her bedroom.  
(A little piece of context is that her long distance boyfriend arrived at our house last night and so she and him were sleeping in her bedroom, which is why I suspect she used my bathroom to be sick rather than her own.)

I finished brushing my teeth, which at this point still didn’t know there was anything wrong, I walk downstairs to find my mom laying on the couch, looking ill and eating saltine crackers. I asked her if she was okay and she said she was feeling very nauseous. Just then, her boyfriend came into the living room and asked me if her puking woke me up. When he said that, she gave her boyfriend (who isn’t aware of my emetophobia) this wide eyed look that was like “don’t say that”. Right then I made the connection that she wasn’t having a coughing fit in my bathroom, she was vomiting. I instantly felt this surge of anger and overwhelming emotion from head to toe and I went back to my bedroom and cried for probably 30 minutes straight. I wasn’t even having a panic attack, I just felt so angry with her. I felt betrayed and so hurt that she chose to use my bathroom out of the 3 bathrooms we have in the house. She went out of her way to walk out of her bedroom and into my bathroom to be sick, and then wasn’t going to even tell me that she was sick in my bathroom. My mom is very aware of how bad my emetophobia is and knows how obsessive I can be with contamination and cleanliness.

 I honestly felt resentment towards both her and her boyfriend, and even if that seems irrational, it’s my raw feelings. I felt like she was protecting him from getting sick over me since they are sharing her bathroom while he stays with us. Even if that wasn’t her intention, it’s how my brain perceived it. Ironically, her bf didn’t seem to care that she was potentially contagious because i saw them kissing each other several times today. Meanwhile I am trying not to ruminate over the fact that i used my toothbrush that was sitting on my bathroom counter while she was vomiting. 
Anyway, I had my moment and cried to release those angry feelings and after a bit I felt okay to come out of my room and try and resume my day as normal as possible. But here is an aspect of my emetophobia that I REALLY struggle with that came to the forefront today. When someone else is sick, I feel like I need to micromanage them and tell them they can’t touch certain things. So I came downstairs to make myself some breakfast and my mom seemed to be feeling better and was in the kitchen cooking and touching basically everything. The fridge, the toaster, the drawers, cupboards, coffee machine, door handles, peanut butter jar… everything. It took a lot for me not to blurt out “can you please stop touching everything in the kitchen since you were just vomiting?!” But I refrained since I felt awkward saying that in front of her boyfriend. If he hadn’t been there, I would’ve likely asked her to stay out of the kitchen until she’s free of symptoms. And she knows I would cook meals for her when sick, as I have every time in the past. However, it’s been eating at my thoughts all day and the image of her sick hands touching everything in the kitchen won’t leave my head. And then the anger starts to resurface. Why can’t people be respectful and mindful that the other individuals living in their home don’t want to get sick?! 

I hate that I’m angry. I’m writing this because I’m frustrated that I’m upset with her rather than sympathetic. I know she had no control over this. I know she’s probably feeling shitty. But I can’t help but feel resentful. I think it’s that I’m not mad that she got sick, I’m upset with how she contaminated my space and wasn’t going to tell me, and I still wouldn’t have known if her boyfriend didn’t speak up. I’m also upset that she is touching everything in the house and making food as if she wasn’t vomiting this morning. It turns from sympathy to resentment when it starts to affect me, when there are certain things that she could avoid doing to spread a sickness. ",1,1736642471.0,emetophobiarecovery,1,1.0,False

1hzaf5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hzaf5e/so_isolated_how_to_find_friends/,So isolated - how to find friends?,"I (38F) moved to the countryside during the pandemic because that's the only place I could afford a house. I'm close to the city I was living in previously and the initial point of buying in this location was to continue my city life while building a new one here. But then there was a pandemic so I actually just stayed completely alone for 18 months and during that time the (few) close friends I had in the city moved on to other things (more kids, new careers, new cities) that make them less available, so my city life didn't exist in the same way when the lockdown ended. 

I put a lot of effort into making connections here. I set up clubs around my interests and at least for the first couple of years I was really determined to fill every space in my calendar with things to do. But gradually people just stopped turning up and when I reached out to them as a friend (to catch up over coffee?) they would treat me as an event organiser - ""I don't really like the new venue for X club, let me know if you switch back"" and then never heard from them again. 

I feel like I get on great with these people when I see them but they're only interested in seeing me for activities, no one just wants to ""hang out"". I tried in the first couple of years to text ppl now and then to ask if they fancied a pint or a coffee or something else and the answer was always no, so I stopped asking. 

I got severely depressed at the start of this year due to the isolation and had no one to reach out to during what was genuinely a life or death moment for me so I reached out to a friend from one of the clubs. They could see my distress (though I was uncomfortable to be honest about my plans) and were very nice to me that evening but then I never heard from them again. 

I know this all sounds like I'm just majorly disliked,  but I really don't get that feeling when I'm with these people and I am still invited to things on the rare occasion they organise something. It feels more like they just have already got friends/ just want to hang with their partner etc. so they're just not available. 

I'd be happy to just see them at activities now and then to share hobbies (this feels like the level of friendly friendship they're looking gut for) if I could just find *other* people to be closer with. In the city, I had friends where we'd sit over coffee and talk for hours and I'm so lonely without that. That was before people had kids, of course. Those friends don't have time for that any more but we talk once a week on the phone to make it logistically easier for everyone. 

I also just want people I can just text or chat to or just ask to go to the pub with me but I haven't made those connections. 

I would like a partner but that seems even harder to achieve. I don't really understand how ppl find love on dating apps because I've been on them six years now and I end up going on dates not because I'm interested in someone but because they're not as bad as the last 50 people. I connect easily with men IRL but so far it has always turned out they are not single. I don't seem to meet single men IRL - I don't know where they're hiding!

I'm finding that I'm filling up my time by going to a lot of things alone. It feels better than just sitting inside - at least I can see other people's faces. It doesn't come naturally to me to 'cold approach' strangers at events but I try to steel myself to say something to someone - like just complimenting the event for instance. But I feel like I don't naturally end up meeting anyone's eyes and it feels strange to tap someone on the shoulder to say ""it's good isn't it?"" Lol.

I just feel helpless now. I feel like I've done all the things you're advised to do and nothing worked. I'm starting to feel like it's completely impossible and I will be alone forever.

For cultural reasons.. please bare in mind I'm in the UK! We don't really have a culture of just talking to people in just any situation. It's not impossible but there are....rules.... that are a bit hard to describe. But it would be odd if I just started a conversation with someone on the bus, for example.

I dont think he's minds the pay difference but it's still something I think about for obviously reasons, and how say long term how would that dynamic pay out especially as he goes on to make more. I'm in school so I hope to make more but still. I'm just an overthinker so I always think long term about situations.

I have been dealing with chronic  constipation for over a year and after eating pizza for the first time in a month I have shit like 5 times in 5 hours. I usually take miralx in my coffee in the morning and a fiber supplement at night and I at least go once a day but I haven't  taken it today....also have alot of stomach gurgling, gas, oily film in stool water I've noticed for the last month or so. 

  I have been to several Dr's. in the last year....had 2 colonoscopys done too which a few polps were removed but everything else was normal. I've had several different  blood tests done and for the most part everything is normal minus having borderline high cholesterol and triglycerides. I also had a abdominal CT where everything came back normal. I sick of trying to explain my symptoms to Dr's and them telling me I'm fine.

It's a powder mixed with coffee, and the ingredients seem legit. If you are curious, here’s a helpful [review I found](https://weightlosssmartly.com/java-burn-review-the-best-metabolism-booster/).

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try keep this short and sweet, unlike me. I'm your typical British tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a serious friendship with someone who I click with and we just get it. Someone who has the time and effort to invest in creating a lasting bond, who I can be my silly self around without worry about being judged.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

A little about me:

- Big heavy metal fan - throw some recommendations my way!
- Also enjoys watching anime and documentaries.

- I've been working on/off now for a while on an android game. I leave it for a few months then forget where I'm up to and start again.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other

- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

I have a hard time focusing and doing work at school because either my class is loud or the teacher is talking. Earplugs kind of work, but honestly, I feel like school is a big waste of time and could be more straight to the point.

1hza61m,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_LewdyStrudey/comments/1hza61m/journal_entry_5/,Journal Entry #5,"Dear Diary,

I’ve officially descended into a soap opera, and I don’t know if I’m the cunning anti-hero or the comic relief. Either way, the icing is about to hit the fan.

This morning, I approached Sgt. Daniels with my proposal. I waited until after roll call, caught him in the hallway, and casually said, “We need to talk about… toppings.”

He froze, his coffee halfway to his lips. For a moment, I thought he’d deny everything, but then his face turned the color of a marinara spill on a white shirt. He muttered something about “taking this outside” and hustled me into an empty stairwell.

When I laid out my terms—my SD card in exchange for my silence—he didn’t even hesitate. “Fine,” he grumbled. “But we’re doing this on neutral ground. I’m not risking someone walking in on us.”

We agreed to meet at Pete’s Diner after our shifts. Public, inconspicuous, and conveniently located next to a 24-hour bakery. I thought I had everything under control, Diary. I even made a backup plan: before the meeting, I copied the incriminating pizza video onto my laptop. Insurance. Just in case.

The exchange itself went off without a hitch. Daniels slid my SD card across the table, and I handed his back with a smirk. He muttered something about “never eating pizza again” and stormed out, clutching his card like it was a winning lottery ticket.

I thought I was in the clear. But as I was paying my tab, I overheard it—the sound of a lover’s quarrel brewing in the parking lot.

“What the hell, Mark? Who was that?”

I peeked out the window and saw Daniels, red-faced and stammering, facing off with a tall man in a leather jacket who was clearly not a fan of neutral ground exchanges. That’s when it hit me: this was Daniels’ boyfriend.

“It’s not what you think!” Daniels said, holding his hands up defensively.
“Oh, really? Then why were you whispering about SD cards like you’re in some kind of spy movie?”

I should’ve stayed to watch, Diary. I really should’ve. But the thought of getting dragged into yet another scandal sent me into fight-or-flight mode. I bolted out the back door, ran to my car, and drove straight home.

Now, here I am in my kitchen, surrounded by strudels. I’ve already filmed two videos—“Morning Glory Glaze” and “Sticky Situations: Volume 3”—just to calm my nerves. The frosting is therapeutic, but the guilt is creeping back in.

Should I feel bad for Daniels? Maybe. But let’s be real—he owes me. If his boyfriend finds out about his pizza escapades, I’m not the one who’ll have to explain why Domino’s is blocked on their Wi-Fi.

For now, I’ll keep my head down, my icing smooth, and my secrets locked away. Well… most of them.

There have always been general employment issues like being on time, expectations surrounding nap times, etc but those have been addressed and mostly ignored multiple times and we’ve given up on them. But these things seem more serious.

I’ve noticed specifically two things in my home that are missing. They are low in value, a new pair of sweatpants and a book, but we had them and now we do not. I’ve looked everywhere and they are simply not here.

The sweatpants are my daughter’s but as plain black sweats could be thought to be boys, but they are not in my son’s room and are not in our donation bin. I know for a fact that our nanny folded them as I put them into the hamper for her to fold, and that’s the last time I saw them. This wouldn’t be a massive deal except that it’s been quite cold lately and she doesn’t have many sweatpants so the fact that pants I just bought are now gone is particularly glaring. Our nanny has a young boy in her life that I’ve given her hand-me-down toys for in the past, but these pants were new worn one time ever and were not included in any of those bags.

The book is a book our nanny talks about often which is what even reminded me that we owned a copy, but I’ve not been able to find it anywhere. We keep all of our children’s books in one bookcase and it’s not there. It’s a small house, things don’t just vanish. I hope hope hope I am wrong on this and there aren’t other things too that I just haven’t noticed yet. 

Also my son has told me on several occasions now that our nanny leaves him and my daughter in the car while she runs errands or stops at her house. We drove past a dunkin the other day and he told me he goes there sometimes with the nanny. That location does not have a drive through so I asked if he went inside and he told me no they wait in the car. I literally even think twice before running across to a mailbox while leaving my kids in the car, I never ever run errands and leave them alone. I can only imagine her waiting in a long coffee line while my toddlers are outside unattended.

The problem is none of this is verifiable and after the conversations we’ve already had about being late every day, letting my kids cry it out, etc, I already know how defensive and uncomfortable this would be to discuss. How would you handle?

One other concern, and this is pure curiosity, but every week there is a gap in time between when my daughter gets out of school and when they get home. Her school is 5 min away and yet it takes them nearly an hour to get home. Nanny is not picking up lunch because she orders uber eats after nap time. It’s sad to even ask this question but is it ridiculous to ask her? I hate this dynamic so much but she is really great with them, they love her, and it’s very difficult to find someone so we’ve bit our tongue quite a lot and now I’m afraid to push too much",2,1736641297.0,NannyEmployers,8,0.75,False

My job is also remote and I haven't been promoted. Our former UX designer (let's call him Bob) has moved to a different project, so I've taken on his work and I now do UI and UX. I willfully told them I wanted to learn UX. I think having UX in my toolbox is just good to have and would make me well-rounded. Also, the UI work I was getting was basically non-existent and I had to ""find"" work for myself. I've been doing UX for about 4 months now. Although I know some companies hire one person to do UI/UX, it's not that way here at this company. It's usually split up into two departments. I get my work done ahead of time, I study UX courses, I deliver projects before the deadline and I've had coffee chats with coworkers. I'm writing this to say I feel like I'm often unnoticed and no one really sees my value. I'm forgotten about in meetings as I may not get an invite, I'll be forgotten on projects and UX/UI will be skipped in the work flow, and Bob has stepped in to basically take over a project I'm working on. I've talked to my actual manager, but he doesn't even do UX or UI. He's an art director. The Senior UX manager (which is Bob's manager) doesn't want to mentor me because he'd rather have Bob take that role. Bob has taken on a mentor role for me now. Anyway, I'm remote so it also makes it very difficult to be seen. Some employees are local/in office and some aren't. They just flew out UX designers to the local office for the week, but said I won't be flown out because I'm not a senior level, despite the UX designers they flew out were not even senior level.

I think I might need support but I don’t know. RANT!,"I would like to tell my story because I have been really frustrated with myself lately. It’s the story of my diagnosis, my life leading up to it, & what I am struggling with now. Maybe somebody else will have a similar experience & maybe we can relate. I just really want to get this off my chest to someone who would understand. You could definitely skip through to the end because this is extremely long & I am incapable of summarizing (my work colleagues get annoyed & joke about it all the time)

I was diagnosed on the spectrum in 2022, I was 20 going on 21. I am also a woman (really I just identify as a human but woman is okay too) so that will probably explain a lot of this story. Originally when I got my diagnosis, somehow they mixed up my information with someone else’s. Which I noticed because for one thing, they listed me as being left handed in this long ass document. I also knew from prior discussion that I was not ADHD as was on this unrevised document, & the other thing they put down which I do not remember what it was was something that did not make sense whatsoever. I only mention this because it raises a few red flags as to the quality of help & support I received from this place. After my document was revised, my diagnosis was ASD with comorbid General Anxiety Disorder as well as Major Depressive Disorder. Other providers I have seen have listed it as SEVERE Major Depressive Disorder for that last part. I forget the exact wording but there was a message that the psychiatrist giving me my diagnosis left me with that will never leave my head. She told me to not take my diagnosis of ASD too seriously & to not identify with it too much because I was low support needs & would probably not need any sort of support at all for anything. So when I talk about it with anyone, I feel like I talk about it too much and I feel guilty. 

For a bit of background into how I got to that point I will tell y’all about my sister. Growing up, my sister had a lot of struggles. My parents never got her formally diagnosed but diagnosed her themselves (mainly my mom) as “slightly autistic”. They claimed that it was caused by heavy metals from vaccines. Their proof? Apparently before the age of 2 she could see great, spoke in full intelligent sentences, & was overall impressive. Then after the age of 2 after she finished a round of vaccines, she stopped talking & would reach for a crayon a few inches to the side of it, developed a speech impediment/stutter, & started walking on her tip toes. She started to speak a bit more sometimes, however the words were not always real & were inhibited by her speech impediment. The only person who could understand her or what she was conveying, was me. So my parents would have me translate for her & I would ask her if what I told them was right & she would just nod her head. My parents always made it clear to me that she had it worse off than me & that my life would always be easier than hers because I was not “Slightly Autistic” like her. That I had to look out for & take care of her. Whenever I rebutted their theory about her because I was annoyed at our difference in treatment, they would drill into my head that she spoke better than me & was smarter than me before the age of 2. Almost as if to let me know that had these vaccines not gotten to her, she could have been even more impressive & intelligent than me. 

❗️TRIGGER WARNING, mentions of “c*ring” Autism which is not real and I do not condone. Please skip this paragraph if you are sensitive ❗️: I remember growing up that I would like to sit/perch on the counter a lot. And I have clear memories of sitting on the counter watching my mom make a heavy metal detox to try & c*re my sister. This was very hard for me to watch. Because I didn’t understand why she had to do this. And it also made my view of Autism very negative. I wondered if she would be better off cured. 

As we got older, my sister had lots of struggles with reading and writing but I did not. I actually skipped pre-k, kindergarten, & flew through 1st grade like a breeze. I seemed to be extremely proficient with language, reading & words. I enjoyed everything about my English & Word Building subjects except for essays, reports, and outlines because I couldn’t understand how to do them no matter how hard I tried & I still don’t understand to this day. I was also homeschooled, so I could just make something look similar to what any one of those things visually looked like in my books and my mom would just give me an A. Because I was so good with words compared to my sister and my high school drop out parents were homeschooling me, my frustrations and struggles with learning how to actually use the words went unnoticed I believe. I actually took my job to protect my Autistic sister very seriously. In church when a teacher asked my sister to read, I would blurt out that she couldn’t & she didn’t want to & I could do it for her. She actually really appreciated it, but my teachers at church thought I was being mean to my sister and thought I was cocky & rude. I always was mistreated by teachers at church and they all loved my little sister because she was an adorable little cinnamon roll. Unfortunately, I didn’t get that flavor. They looked at her as helpless but cute. I was very loud with my beliefs, I would try to fight for what was right and be a “crusader” because my eccentric also very different dad told me to. I was hyper focused & hell bent on justice, standing up, being “real”, telling an adult when bullying was happening, and trying to do everything as right as possible. So yeah, I was always considered a cocky know-it-all who would talk back & taddle tell. I experienced a lot of bullying from adults & children alike. 

In my teenage years, I was also bullied. At the start I remember wondering how do people talk to each other & what do they talk about. I just couldn’t understand how people effortlessly laughed & made conversation together. I did a lot of staring & observing quietly & was considered creepy & to be a “weirdo” by my peers. I didn’t know how to not over share, so sometimes people would egg me on to share things about my crushes for example to use against me later. I thought when they were telling me to keep going & laughing that they were laughing with me & genuinely enjoying what I was saying. I thought that I figured out how to talk to people & briefly believed this is what being normal & liked is like. However, I later on learned that actually I was being made into a joke & they were actually laughing at me & were going to tell the whole church youth group about everything I said. Then there were rumors made about me and I was consistently bullied from then on. That’s as deep as I’ll go with that. Every social group I entered from then on, I was turned into a scapegoat or joke at some point. Sometimes I was even physically abused. I was always trying to be cool & would imitate other people’s actions. I would deeply study into things people were interested in to try and fit in but I was always late to the party. I learned how to do makeup to help me fit in & be more popular, but as it turns out it was too superior. I tried to do my makeup, clothes style, music taste, everything to fit in. Everything was like some sort of equation I was trying to figure out to try & be normal because I felt that something was wrong with me because everything was uncomfortable & hard. But even with all my effort & research I was still “different”. My clothes were too cool, they didn’t match the people I was with & were considered eccentric. Same with my makeup, music everything. Basically my point is, it was so damn hard growing up. I was in with the popular kids in my choir and theater group and the misfits (because I took it upon myself to make sure I befriended every misfit I ever met so they wouldn’t feel like me or my dad growing up). But I actually realized as an adult, that there were a lot of times I put up with severe mistreatment because they would just tell me they were joking and I brushed it off and laughed with them because I thought stuff like “they only tried to throw me at this wall because we’re friends and they were joking and I was annoying”. Plus it didn’t help that my dad was verbally abusive and so I really was so used to mean “jokes”.  As another fun anecdote, I used to always (haha used to) hide at parties or run away. Before one choir party when I was 15, my dad was dropping me off & stopped the vehicle on the side of the road to drop a bomb on me about something he did when he was younger. He also started crying to me & telling me that I needed to take care of my sister because she was always gonna have a hard time in life and I had it easier than her because she is “slightly autistic”. I definitely didn’t hide away at that party and teach myself to play ukulele then get sad because I missed everything after that 👀

Anyways this post is getting way too long. But I actually had lots of struggles growing up that apparently went completely unnoticed. My parents confronted the adults who treated me badly which is how I know what they thought about me. And they saw and knew about all of the bullying. But they chalked it up to the fact that I was “special” and they were all jealous. Special because, I was gifted with an amazing voice (I’ve got medals and stuff to prove it), gifted at acting, pretty good at dancing (good enough to at least get me through theater with leads), proficient at painting, makeup, drawing, etc. I would say there isn’t one artistic thing that I couldn’t excel at including culinary. I learned how to do adult things like making coffee, cooking, and cleaning whole entire rooms (etc) at a young age to make my parents proud. And I was too smart for my own good as they put it, they even left me to teach myself school and my mom only graded me. Every time I cried and voiced my struggles that I was reading things over and over again and getting frustrated she would just change my curriculum. They chalked up the fact that I couldn’t understand social situations to social anxiety and awkwardness. The fact that my room was always in a complete mess (I’m talking tornado), I couldn’t finish my school in time, forgot things constantly, left messes and forgot about them, was disorganized, and couldn’t sleep or wake up at the right time was chalked up to laziness and the wrong mindset. When I did this head bob thing every time I wore a Jean jacket (trying to fit in mind you) it was just a nervous twitch which I needed to stop. My aversion to fake Sherpa and other fabrics such as corduroy and others was just a quirk. When I had meltdowns, I was just stressed and being dramatic. When I was hiding and running away I was just being antisocial and rude. Which brings me to now….

When I talk to my mom about the struggles I had she always diminishes them. She doesn’t really believe my diagnosis. My dad does believe me which is really funny. If y’all knew the family dynamics I think you would laugh. I once brought up to her how me and my sister used to BOTH tip toe and pace around the coffee table and I would “skip” for years as my main mode of transport but I stopped tip toeing force-ably as a kid because she told me to “stop doing that, people are going to think you’re autistic” and she told me that never happened. So yeah I don’t really get the support there. My boyfriend seems very frustrated with me lately and doesn’t like to talk to much about my diagnosis with me. It makes him uncomfortable I guess. Sometimes he does make jokes about it though. Like, he’ll call things “Autismo” and sometimes he probably doing it offensively but I can’t really tell because I think that word is funny. 

But I’m frustrated with myself. I live by myself now and my apartment is in shambles, I’m in a pretty bad situation actually. I believe I may be struggling with executive dysfunction and always have been. I feel stuck. I don’t have any close friends and no one to hang out with. I can’t make close friends. And I’ve been having a lot of almost like, emotional outbursts because of my situation. I recently did a big 5 personality test and found out I’m extremely high in neuroticism and very low in conscientiousness. So that made me feel worse. I’ve been having a lot of depressive episodes. I can only get up, get ready for work barely, get on the bus because I haven’t been able to learn to drive, go home on the bus, feed my cat, stay up obsessing over random things and hyper fixations way too late, not get enough sleep, forget my medication for my autoimmune disease till the end of time, do it all over again. And I fall asleep at work constantly. I have been really bad with hygiene too. I wasn’t this bad when I lived with my boyfriend. But I just feel like I can’t do anything except for what’s “necessary” and yet there are things that should probably be considered necessary like hygiene and cleaning and feeding myself that feel like rocket science. And everyone thinks I’m just dramatic and lazy and god it just sucks. I’m starting to wonder, is this because I actually do need support? And because the support I need is just to have somebody there to fall back on? Like if I’m struggling with tasks I need somebody to help me and keep me motivated. Can I not live alone? Why am I so pathetic and lazy and incapable? I thought I was smart and special? When my boyfriend got together with me, he said he had never met any other girl like me and that I was different. That was before my diagnosis. What if the autism is what made me different and I actually need help and now he’s not gonna wanna deal with it when he finds out that actually I can’t change these things and I need help. And I’m not a good enough “woman” for him because I can’t do simple things properly? Or what if I’m actually just dramatic, lazy, and the psychiatrist just told me what I wanted to hear and I’m not Autistic at all. That’s my story! Hope you enjoyed!!!

1hz9ppg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manipulation/comments/1hz9ppg/sexual_harassment_manipulation_maybe/,"Sexual harassment, manipulation? Maybe?","**TLDR: Do you think this situation involves manipulation? I appreciate your feedback.**

I'm a student in a grad program that involves doing internships, currently looking for a post-grad job. One of my past internships was a great fit for me, offers a stable career path, the leadership seems good.

But the dynamic with my supervisor was really weird. They'd probably be my supervisor again if I went back. Even if not, it's a small team, so we'd interact a lot.

Nothing ever happened. But they were just way too focused on me. Giving me way more support than others, always wanting to talk to me, wanting to see me outside of work. Asking me personal questions and sharing about their life. Staring at me? They're in a committed relationship, too.

What really made it feel weird was that they'd be indirect. For example, heavily implying they want me to come to some party, but not directly asking. They said they needed my personal phone number for some logistical thing, but never actually used it for that. There was this whole thing that ended up with us alone in their office, door closed, me sitting in their chair, them bending over across my lap. They'd sometimes stand real close to me during hello/goodbye moments, as if wanting me to hug them, which I didn't.

I felt like I was going crazy because technically they weren't doing anything. Maybe this was all normal work stuff. But something about the vibe was intense and flirty.

After my internship ended, we kept in touch a little. I started a new internship and they started volunteering there. Again, they were really focused on me. They'd always go out of their way to come find me and talk. Our supervisor noticed and tried to stop them. Once, the supervisor called them out to their face. They said, annoyed, ""You're lucky to have her."" This other supervisor reacting negatively was what pushed me towards thinking this wasn't normal, and maybe I'd normalized it.

After our supervisor called them out, they would still pop up near me, but they'd have a reason for why. Each reason seemed normal, but it happened many times in a row. They'd volunteer the reason unnecessarily. I think maybe they left an item of theirs where I'd find it, so that I'd return it? That sounds crazy, right?

They started asking me to hang out outside of work. I was relieved that they were finally being direct. This seemed better than finding their stuff at my internship. They brought up sexual topics, talked about longing for someone you can't have, and downplayed their relationship with their partner. They said they've been doubting whether they have the right motivations. They randomly brought up how sometimes their partner goes out of town and they're alone for the weekend. Multiple times, they asked if I need help with things that would have involved going over to each other's places, which I didn't.

At the end of their volunteer gig, they suggested I should come meet them at a weird time/place. I couldn't get there because of car trouble. They said they'd drive me. Which is 2 hours of driving for them. Just so we can get lunch? I didn't go. This whole time, I'd been wondering if their partner knew about me, and this plan seemed in line with trying to hide it from the partner.

I didn't talk to them for a couple of months. I felt like I'd ended up in a situation I didn't want to be in. If they're driving 2 hours to get me, I'm supposed to sleep with them, right? But, I also felt paranoid for thinking that was happening. They sent me a joking text about some work news being a secret, which it wasn't actually. We have secrets now. Great.

Job applications were coming up. I hit them up, wanting to check on the situation. We got coffee. Their partner showed up unannounced in the middle. They both seemed upset with each other. It seemed like the partner didn't know I was going to be there, or I wasn't what she expected. Nobody explained anything about why that happened.

That was enough for me. Even if I was wrong about all this, I was too stressed out, and it wasn't worth it.

I texted them that I needed to stop hanging out with them but wished them well. They tried to play it off like I was having a crisis, and I doubled down and explained why. They said they support my decision if that's what I need. They never said anything like, ""You're right, I agree that we crossed some boundaries"" or ""I didn't see it that way, I didn't realize.""

After job applications opened, I got an email from a mutual connection inviting me to apply where they work, which I strongly suspect was their idea, because of some specific things about it that don't make sense.

The part where it's kinda not sexual harassment is the part where I really liked them. I liked their attention. I was into it. I'm sure they could tell that I liked it, and that encouraged them. They were probably responding naturally to my signals. It's not fair for me to be like, ""It's so weird that you always come talk to me!"" but also like...they're probably doing it because I'm really happy when they do. I saw the implications because I was looking for them. If someone I wasn't interested in did this type of thing, I don't even think I would realize.

But also, whenever I was expressing interest in them, I did it openly. I'd just ask if they wanted to get coffee. I was usually initiating based on something they'd previously suggested we could do. I didn't show up at their job and be like ""Oh I'm just getting my bike, don't mind me"" while staring at them as I walk past.

I did try to set boundaries. It was hard to stick to that, because of my feelings, the power dynamic, and them pushing it forward. It was hard to wrap my head around what was going on and make the right decisions. I think they tried too. A couple of times, I saw them noticeably make an effort to walk it back. But then, they eventually reached out again. There were many times when they could have done more, taken it farther, and they didn't.

I do think, as my supervisor, they should have been more real about boundaries, but most of this happened after the supervisor role ended.",0,1736640136.0,Manipulation,1,0.5,False
1hz9okz,https://www.reddit.com/r/brokenbones/comments/1hz9okz/spiral_tibial_fracture_with_plate/,Spiral tibial fracture with plate,"Reddit has been so helpful with keeping me hopeful throughout the recovery process. So I'm sharing my journey here in case it helps anyone with a similar injury.

How it happened: 

Dec 7. I slipped and fell, as uneventful as that. The doc said, when I rolled my ankle I likely landed on a particular tiny part of the ankle. It was too small to shoulder the impact of the fall so the force travelled up the tibia and exited mid-way up where I have the beautiful spiral fracture.

https://preview.redd.it/2ae32dswegce1.jpg?width=642&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4d2b1e7922be37f6ec123067f16ff05794b6f81

  


Moment I learned: 

it is what it is. Shit happens. My nurse friends were really helpful in assuring me the human body is amazing, will heal, and that the first step to recovery is really a positive mind set - based on their experience caring for patients with all sorts of injuries. 

Surgery: 

I had to wait 6 days for surgery. Had a plate and 8 screws put in. They did a good job with the back slab in emergency. Swelling was actually down by day 3 so they could operate but too many fracture patients in the queue.

In the 6 days waiting: 

Did move around in a wheelchair to go to the toilet. I also went super healthy - no processed sugar, veggies, protein, only 1 cup of coffee a day, and I don't smoke which is good (for recovery as well said the doc). I also took paracetamol with ibuprofen for the first few days only as administered by nurses and just paracetamol around the clock after. I resisted the tapentadol only for when it's extremely painful around once a day. (I kept telling myself childbirth is more painful.)

Post-surgery:

I was in a backslab for 6 days then a cam boot. Only took paracetamol + tapentadol the first two days then kept to paracetamol, I didn't want to rely too much on the strong painkiller. When the surgeon removed the back slab he found my stitches healed so well he already removed them. Then I was in a cam boot.

It was the holidays so I've mostly been at home with my leg elevated. I went out for the first time 2 weeks post-op on a wheelchair. I've been out maybe 4 times now.

I'm 4.5 weeks post-op and I'm still eating healthy, drinking at least 1 cup of bone broth everyday and still keeping caffeine to a minimum. I have had two drinks over Christmas haha and sticking to non-alcoholic beer the rest of the time.

Swelling + exercise + cam boot:

For me my foot tends to swell when I've been out without the foot elevated so I just ice it when I get home and give it a massage.

I do all the suggested exercises twice a day by my physio and other exercises I found on YouTube.

I still sleep with my cam boot on but when I'm just sitting down working from home I remove it so I can move my ankle around and point and flex my foot.

I'll update when I get an xray done in a week and a bit.

I recently discovered he’s been close friends with a girl for years, and they chat regularly. I confronted him, and he assured me they were just friends, but I’m still feeling uneasy. How can I manage these feelings of insecurity?

Story:

My boyfriend (25M) and I (30F) have been together for 2 years. Early in our relationship, I noticed a girl’s name frequently popping up on his phone. I didn’t bring it up because I was meeting him and my family for the first time. This past holiday, I saw her name again, which bothered me, so I messaged his best friend to ask if he knew her (I saw they’re fb friends), and he denied being familiar with the name.

We’re in a long-distance relationship—he lives in a small town near a big city, where he visits friends every two weeks, and I live alone in a new province. We try to meet in person every two to three months due to the cost of flights, and we’ve been planning to move in together this year.

I’ve been studying for an upcoming license exam, but this girl has been on my mind. They stay connected via text and social media, while my boyfriend and I don’t follow each other on social media. Finally, I confronted him, and he showed me screenshots, claiming they only send memes to each other and that they’ve been friends since 2019. When I looked at the memes, I realized they were related to their careers, which I couldn’t relate to because of my different educational background.

I also found a drawing she made of him a couple of years ago with a caption saying, “I love that smile.” When I confronted him further, he told me we could meet her, that she had a boyfriend, and that I shouldn’t worry. He mentioned they had met for coffee when I first came to the province and that he’d told me about her, but honestly, he never did—he just said he met a friend.

I’m feeling uneasy about all of this, especially with us planning to move in together. I don’t want to feel jealous, but I’m struggling to shake the feeling. Right now, I’m unsure how to handle it.

How can I navigate feelings of insecurity and jealousy about a close friendship my boyfriend has with another woman, especially when we are planning to take our relationship to the next level?",0,1736640029.0,relationship_advice,24,0.5,False

Hey there! I’m Danny, a 30-year-old marketing professional with a sharp sense of humor and a zest for life. I use a wheelchair for longer distances, but don’t let that fool you—I’m fully independent, driven, and always ready to dive into life’s adventures. I’m here to meet someone special for a connection filled with fun, laughter, and unforgettable moments.


What Makes Dating Me Unique?

	•	VIP Parking: Say goodbye to circling parking lots—we always get the best spots.
	•	Skip the Line: Hate waiting? So do I. We’re masters at cutting straight to the fun.
	•	Built-In Laughter: My injury stories? Hilariously absurd. You’ll be cracking up in no time.
	•	Surprise Perks: From freebies to kind gestures, life’s full of unexpected wins with me.
	•	Zombie Apocalypse Ready: I’m not the fastest, but I’m steady—you’ll always know where I am!

About Me:
I’m a creative soul who loves diving into new experiences. Whether it’s devouring a thought-provoking book, binge-watching the latest cult favorite, or conquering a challenging video game, I thrive on finding unique ways to connect with the world.

I’m an explorer at heart—both in my backyard and abroad. I’ve traveled to Canada, the USA, Colombia, the Bahamas, and Mexico, and I’m always dreaming of my next adventure. Bonus: I speak fluent Spanish, so we’ll have an extra language for inside jokes.

Art, music, and storytelling fuel my soul. I’m happiest in a gallery, sharing playlists, or debating life’s mysteries over coffee. When I’m not out exploring, I stay active with home workouts or nature walks (yes, my wheelchair comes along for the ride).

What I’m Looking For:
I’m open to connecting with women from all walks of life—whether you’re younger, older, nearby, or far away. What truly matters is chemistry. Here’s what I value most:
	•	A Great Sense of Humor: Let’s laugh together until our cheeks hurt.
	•	Adventurous Spirit: Drama-free, down-to-earth, and open to new experiences.
	•	Emotional Connection: Whether it’s friendship or something more, I’m here for meaningful connections.
	•	Flirty & Fun Energy: Playful banter keeps life exciting—and I’m all about that vibe.

Why You Should Message Me:
If you value meaningful conversations, spontaneous adventures, and endless laughter, I’m your guy. I believe the best relationships are built on trust, shared experiences, and a touch of wit. Whether it’s a cozy movie night or a road trip to somewhere new, I bring positivity, humor, and genuine connection to the table.

Oh, and don’t worry—my wheelchair doesn’t hold me back from fully enjoying life, romance included.

Let’s Create Unforgettable Memories:
Life’s too short not to chase joy. Whether we’re visiting a quirky art exhibit, discovering hidden gems, or swapping wild travel stories, I want a partner who’s ready to embrace the big and small adventures with me.

Final Thoughts:
Distance isn’t a barrier if we vibe—connections thrive on energy, not geography. I value empathy, honesty, and a good balance of loyalty and generosity in every relationship.

If you’re in your twenties or beyond and you’re curious about exploring new experiences, sharing deep conversations, and connecting with someone who brings creativity, laughter, and adventure to the table, I’d love to hear from you.

Drop me a message and share your favorite story, adventure, or even your best terrible joke—I’m all ears. Let’s start an amazing chapter together.",1,1736639687.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

* Bellevue is making it easier to repurpose office buildings and hotels into new apartments, including minor expansions, to help create more housing. The discussion starts at around [53:58](https://youtu.be/8bq6iiAvwvs?si=cJxrKRNYqU1p_03h&t=3238) on YouTube. 
* It seems like this is only a small step though, as the council discussion that [starts at 1:11](https://youtu.be/8bq6iiAvwvs?si=HcSkuMJhaixegl2Q&t=4296) points out, there likely won't be many buildings converted to residential this way. They expect less than five in the next seven years. Staff heard from some interest to convert senior housing into higher density residential, some hotel to residential. It's too bad that this code amendment wouldn't  lead to more conversions...housing is a tricky problem!
* Council approved $350K in arts grants for 2025, funding a total of 61 individuals and organizations (66 applied). Grantees ranged from organizations like KidsQuest Museum to individuals like Anita Yan Wong’s seriously impressive “coffee portraits” who received $3,000 to make pretty awesome paintings using a single cup of coffee ([https://www.anitayanwong.com/coffee.html](https://www.anitayanwong.com/coffee.html)). More details: [2025 Arts Grants Allocations](https://bellevue.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=13649487&GUID=2521890A-5640-4CCF-8C4D-AB5666D6CC7A).

The recent rise in popularity has made the drink largely an annoying point of conversation, coupled with people always suggesting terrible versions of a truly amazing cocktail.

Here’s (in my humble opinion) how to properly judge thee iconic drink, that when done right… doesn’t deserve the hate. 

A great espresso martini is made with freshly-pulled espresso in that exact moment (the most important element. Not cold brew, not batch made, but fresh), a neutral vodka base, and a good coffee liquor. No cream based vodka needed. With a fresh pull of espresso - the drink is elevated with an amazing foam from a the espresso reacting with the ice.

When it comes to presentation, stemware is important, having a chilled glass certainly elevates the drink, but it’s about the quality of the stemware in my opinion. Beans are not necessarily required if made truly right (although it’s a nice touch)

I am also making an excel sheet to rank all the places I try in NYC and will share once I have a good sample size for everyone! I also want to recognize that tequila and other liquors are really good with espresso martinis, but not something I enjoy so I’m biased! 

After all of that… where’s your favorite in the city?",2,1736638604.0,FoodNYC,7,0.58,False

Consider this as a FanFiction kinda of thing... Or nota, sinceramente everything here can happen.


[Day #0]

I just lost my relatives. They went into an alley they shouldn't have, and the cannibals got them. Food is becoming scarce, and I don't feel hopeful anymore.

I found a poster looking for hires. It had no details on what was needed, and when I got to the place, there was no interview. Strange, but it seems promising!

[Day #1]

Today was my first day on the job, and I’m getting ready. I was assigned to the Control Team, and after a bit of chatting with our ""Leader,"" I learned her name and realized she's very systematic. I think I'll feel safe working with her!

They gave me some new clothes, which make me feel more confident, and also handed me a large cross for self-defense. They told me to use it on anyone who goes insane.

The shift began! I was assigned to work with something called ""One Sin and Hundreds of Good Deeds."" When I entered the containment cell, I felt calm thanks to the manual they gave me—“just follow it, and everything will be fine,” they said. Still, it felt strange, the way it looked at me, almost as if it could see through my intentions.

How can I describe it? Well, it looked like a cross stuck inside a skull with a crown of thorns. I’ll try to paste a drawing I made of it.

It moved slowly while floating—bizarre.

When I asked it a few questions, I got no answers. It was just too strange! I felt like my mind wandered a bit, but the uniform seemed to absorb... something.

After working with it twice, the day ended. We hit our daily quota, and I headed home. I’m exhausted, and working alone in this department is lonely. I hope they send colleagues soon.

[Day #2]

Another day. When I went to get dressed and grab the cross, there was another girl in the locker room. I was surprised and embarrassed since I’m not used to dressing in front of others. I approached her and tried to talk a little, but she just gave me a thumbs-up and got ready for her shift. I felt a bit sad but now want to be her friend!

About the uniforms: I thought mine was standard for the company, but apparently not. The girl wore a blue outfit with fairy-like wings on the back. It looked cute!

The day began, and I decided to chat with the new Control Team member. Since the manager hadn’t assigned work yet, it felt like a good time. I mentioned how, even after completing the abnormalities management training, I still couldn’t fully grasp things—it was such a massive manual! But... she ignored me entirely.

I was sent to work with another abnormality, this time called ""Beauty and the Beast."" It was... horrifying, really. A disturbing mixture of features that unsettled me deeply. It made me nervous.

The best description? A quadrupedal cockroach with ant-like mandibles, multiple eyes, and horns adorned with roses. It seemed like it was looking for someone to carry something. I didn’t want to get involved!

But I had no choice. They sent me to work with it again.

At least the day ended quickly after that, and I went home to try and forget that disturbing sight.


[Day #3]

I tripped on my sheets this morning—not great.

Things are a bit better now since they provide us food before shifts, so I’m surviving!

On my way to work, I bumped into that girl again! I tried to interact, and this time, I got a simple ""Hi."" Slowly making progress.

Later, a new person joined our team. They had long hair, and I thought it was a woman at first, but it turned out to be a guy. He seemed friendly. I started chatting, commenting on how experienced and skilled the manager must be to reach this level. He actually responded! He mentioned how strict the contract guidelines are about obedience, and I agreed. From across the room, I heard that girl muttering something about not having a choice.

The new colleague’s name is Christopher—such a cool name.

AND THEN THEY MADE ME WORK WITH THAT THING AGAIN!

This time, it seemed scared, like it wanted to die. I feel sympathy for it now. It seems so sad, and I had to work with it twice more today. I feel awful.

To top it off, I approached that girl again. She was muttering about needing to do her best to bring her family to the Nest. I told her she could do it and that her family would be fine. She seemed confused but slightly happy deep down.

Later, Malkuth called me to the management office. I thought I was in trouble, but it was actually a promotion! I’m so happy—I wish I had someone to share this with.

[Day #4]

When I arrived today, I didn’t expect the news: apparently, a staff member died yesterday, and they were important. It made me question if I really wanted to stay here—but the paycheck convinced me.

In the locker room, there was someone who looked like a man at first, but as they undressed, it was clear they were female apart from the head. I decided to socialize and found out her name is Maria. She was cheerful—unusual for this place—and that gave me some encouragement to keep going.

When I got dressed, I noticed I had new clothes from the promotion: a beige vest and blue pants. They were plain, so I didn’t mind wearing them. My cross was also replaced by a staff with horns, resembling those of the ""Beauty and the Beast.""

The day began quickly, and I was sent to work with Beauty and the Beast again. This time, I was happy to see it seemed well. It even appeared glad to see me, which was comforting. Maybe we’re building some kind of connection?

Back in the room, that girl—Kim, I learned—came to talk to me. She now wore a crown of thorns on her head. She thanked me for my words from yesterday, which I thought were silly at the time. She explained that the skull abnormality gave her the crown, which piqued my curiosity. She introduced herself as Kimhuil and said she hoped working here wouldn’t become too difficult.

Maria caught me staring at Kim for a moment—I think she noticed.


[Day #5]

I’m starting to get used to this place. I think everything will turn out okay.

When I arrived, I greeted Kim and Maria, and Kim finally gave me a full response! I think I’m making progress.

Kim talked to me at the start of the day, saying she now felt like she was truly part of the “Wing.” I was happy for her.

This place still feels strange, though.

A new boy joined us today. He seemed brave.

Later, while working with Beauty again, Kim was talking about how much she needed her paycheck. That’s when I realized I need more than just knowledge to analyze these creatures.

After another session with Beauty, I returned to the room and noticed Maria now had a crown of thorns too. Apparently, the skull is giving those out a lot.

Christopher had a beautiful brooch on. When I asked where he got it, he said it was from another abnormality. Another one?

I chatted briefly with the new guy, who introduced himself as Yui. He seems nice, but I don’t think we’ll interact much.


[Day #6]

When I arrived at the locker room today, there was another new girl. Her badge indicated she was from Information. I’m not sure what department that is, but when I tried to be friendly, she gave me a short, harsh “no.” I left feeling down, but Kim patted me on the back for comfort.

While working, an issue arose—purple slimes appeared, and I was sent to help contain one in the Information Team. The manager seemed serious, and I felt uneasy. When I saw my colleagues injured after handling one, my slight unease turned into full-blown fear.

Yui also got a crown of thorns today. Good for him, I guess.

During containment, I saw that new girl badly injured. After dealing with the slime, we talked a bit. Her name is Camilla.


[####]

""One day, she entered the Count’s room—the room she was instructed never to enter during the day. There, she witnessed the Count’s true form. He was utterly grotesque. Hundreds of eyes, four legs, neither human nor beast.""
F-02-44


[Day #7]

Another day at the corporation. I armed myself, got dressed, and was so distracted I forgot to greet the others.

While heading to work with Beauty, I overheard someone mentioning a new Teth-level abnormality in the Information department. That’s concerning; we already have four of those!

Christopher came to talk to me, saying he was finally understanding how to handle abnormalities and that he got promoted. I was genuinely happy for him.

The days feel repetitive, don’t they?

Something interesting happened, though—Beauty gave me a hair ornament. It’s a beautiful red flower, almost spider-like. I was overjoyed and plan to keep it with me always.

I showed it to Kim and Christopher; they thought it was both pretty and strange. I’m so happy to have this gift.

Another problem arose—this time, killer robots. It was horrifying. When we arrived to contain them, there was a pile of bodies that almost made me vomit.

During containment, one of the robots grabbed a colleague and smashed them to the ground before brutally disfiguring them. We hit it nonstop, all while hearing the man’s screams. He had a family waiting for him… but we couldn’t make it so they’d ever see him again.

After something so horrific, the manager still had the audacity to assign me work with that crucified skull again. I finished the job, and when we were leaving, Camilla was called for something. I’ll congratulate her tomorrow—I just need to clear my mind for now.

[Day 7.5]

As we were leaving, Kim invited me for coffee in one of the districts. I was surprised she had money for that. 

[Day #08]

As I arrived at the corporation, I could see that a lot of people were uneasy. I also noticed two new guys heading to the men’s locker room. Who could they be?

When I entered the women’s locker room, it was clear that the other girls were also very worried after yesterday’s death.

Camilla and Kim were different. Camilla was wearing strange clothes made of human skin cut into cubes—there were even faces on the clothing, which disturbed me greatly. She told me to calm down a bit and then showed me a weapon that was just a chicken’s head with wool. That was enough to make me laugh.

As for Kim, she was wearing woolen clothes and holding a fan with cherry blossoms on it. It was quite stylish.

When the day started, I was presented with some bad news: now we had an HE among us.

As if things couldn’t get worse, I was assigned to work with something called the ""Fragment of the Universe."" I thought it was just a shard of glass painted like space, but when I got there, it was a large black creature with multiple hearts around its body. It was terrifying and produced a horrible sound!

It disgusts me to know that I had to show affection for that thing—it was so strange!

When I returned to the central area, Maria told me that the feeling was normal. She was very kind to me—she's such a nice person.

Apparently, in the middle of the work with the Fragment of the Universe, another problem occurred.

By the end of the workday, I heard an announcement from Ms. Malkuth. Apparently, Yui died. My condolences. That broke me a bit, and the creature seemed to grow even more uncomfortable. I felt something piercing my body and mind.

As I was leaving, Ms. Malkuth issued another alert: Maria had died.

I was in disbelief until I saw Cris injured, returning. He said something about slugs—I hope he’ll be okay.


[Day #09]

I woke up feeling very depressed, but I need to pull myself together and return to work. Things are going to be tough from now on.

While arriving for the workday, I saw Malkuth talking to the Manager. When I asked what would happen after the deaths of two of our colleagues, she simply said they would be replaced soon.

Are we that disposable?

I was assigned to work with the Fragment again, and afterward with the floating skull. That was weird and only worsened my mental state, but after working with the skull, I felt much better.

Another problem began: boxes with clowns inside appeared. They can’t cause much trouble, right?

The box opened the Fragment’s containment door. Those little bastards!

We went after it, and it was in Camilla’s sector. She had quite a few people with her, and they were well-armed. It’s good to see she’s doing well.

After we killed it, the thing exploded! Luckily, no one died.

We were all summoned to the main room of the Information Team to start containing the Fragment.

Everyone gathered, and after two shots from the Manager, we had shields. I felt much more confident, and we managed to contain it quite easily.

[Day #10]

Today in the locker room, there was another girl. I felt sad knowing that it really seemed like we were so replaceable. When I approached, I saw another girl who looked a bit more depressed—they seemed to be part of the Information Team.

I approached and asked for their names, but only got one before Camilla asked me to give them some space. Well, now my goal is to try to be friends with Yuju too!

Camilla mentioned they were new to her team, which made me feel less worried about being disposable. She also showed me that someone had received a headband with dog ears—it was from an anomaly downstairs.

Kim asked for my number. I think I’ve really succeeded!

Another problem started. When I looked, those robots were back. I ran to the room where they were.

Again. He did that again. At least Kim and I killed it. Her weapon is pretty cool; it releases several petals that seemed to mess with that robot’s mind.

After some work with that thing, I returned to the central area, and Cris came up to me, showing that the Beauty also gave him the pendant. We took a photo matching, and Kim sneaked into the background.

[Author’s Note: I’d totally try to draw it, but I can’t, so it’s not happening.]

As we were leaving, Ms. Malkuth called me. I already thought I was in trouble, but it turned out to be another promotion. I was thrilled!

[Day #11]

When I entered the locker room, there were three new girls. I was informed that one of them was from the Control Team. Apparently, the voices in my head were right.

One of them introduced herself as Owen, claiming to be an anomaly specialist. She seemed like someone very prudent and was from the Training Team.

The other two introduced themselves as Susana and Quinn. I thought their names were beautiful.

I went to my locker to get dressed, and once again, they changed my things! They could at least notify us.

This time, I had a very large katana—it was beautiful. When I showed it to Kim, she was stunned. As for the outfit, I thought it was quite pretty, long with red and beige details.

I was surprised to find out that all this time, there had been a tag on the clothing with its name. Apparently, this one was called Laetitia. I went to ask Kim, and she was just surprised I hadn’t noticed.

At the start of the day, the Manager asked everyone to gather in the elevator. He said they would be testing an unknown anomaly.

The boy who went to do the work returned mentally broken. He described a bright green flower.

The Manager sent everyone back to their departments. Apparently, they got the information they needed—he said something about behavior.

Quinn seems so lazy.

We received a notification that someone named Antonio went mad. My team wasn’t sent to contain him, at least.

Susana also went mad?!

That anomaly escaped. Apparently, its name is “Carnivorous Lantern.” They said it was somewhere near my team’s location. I was warned not to approach.

This is a big problem. We only have one person with a ranged weapon—I found out because he passed by us, and I kept hearing incessant gunfire.

I was assigned to work with the Fragment, and on my way back, the emergency signal went off. Another problem—this time, those purple slimes were back.

It was much easier to deal with this time. The weapon I have now is really strong—it felt like death itself was stalking my enemies with every slash.

Near the end of the day, Antonio went mad again.

Quinn panicked, too! I was instructed not to go to her. The Manager said he would handle it himself and ordered everyone to return home.

[Day #12]

Strange. When I arrived, I didn’t see Quinn. Could she have been too unwell to work today?

Another day began, and now we have six TETHs here. This place is getting much more dangerous.

Kim came back with the crown of thorns stored away. Apparently, she also received the pendant and decided to wear it to match us!

She chatted with me for a bit, and soon we were sent to another task.

Two alarms went off. Kim died, and the slimes were back... If this was their fault, I swear I’ll dedicate everything I have to destroying them.

Marinel went mad. I don’t know who he is, but I feel like it’s those damned purple slimes’ fault.

Yuju also went mad, and soon after, two anomalies escaped. This isn’t good!

Once again, we were summoned to the Information Team’s room.

While we were containing this “Rudolta” anomaly, its appearance was so strange that the Manager ordered us to retreat immediately. He said he would end the shift and deal with it himself.

[A####]

""Davi was famous in his department for his attempts to communicate with the 'Fragment of the Universe.' He was an intellectual who loved reading philosophical books and stargazing. His interest in the anomaly was so great that it got him the job; he studied its language and behavior purely out of personal interest.""
O-03-60

[Day #13]

What a horrible day. I spent the night staring at that photo. I hope Kim’s family is doing well... maybe I won’t be. Even though I didn’t know her for long, she was still my first friend and connection since my parents’ deaths.

As I was walking to the corporation, I thought I saw something I wished was real. I feel like I saw Kim, but I knew it wasn’t real. I’d better just keep walking and pray no one else dies today.

When I entered the locker room, Camilla greeted me and hugged me. She said she understood how bad it was but that I needed to hold my head up and keep going. That helped a little.

Camilla was wearing different clothes and had a new weapon. Her blouse had a cosmic aspect that was beautiful to see, and her weapon matched the color palette of my outfit.

I hope the Manager sends me to work with that skull again.

Marinel and Yuju are doing well, which is strange. Why hasn’t Quinn shown up yet?

They were wearing really cute outfits—I thought it was adorable and helped lift my spirits.

While we were waiting for everything to start, I took some more time to think. I have no reason to cry anymore. Now I really need to stand up and survive, because it’s clear that the Manager doesn’t care about deaths here.

I realized that friendships don’t make sense here, but at the same time, you can’t go through the day without your comrades by your side.

Cris slapped me when he heard me say that. Then he grabbed my shoulders and started telling me to pull myself together. It was... comforting.

I did another task with the Beauty. It had been a while since I worked with her. It was nice to see her doing well, but she seemed to recognize me differently than before. It was like she saw me as someone she’d already met.

The Manager really sent me to work with that skull. I feel more prudent now and much more stable. I think this skull isn’t so bad after all.

Vera went mad, and we went into another alarm because of some creature. I was ordered to try holding it off alone while Cris finished his task.

They were larvae. Now I understand what they were dealing with that day.

More larvae appeared. We still hadn’t dealt with all of them, but this time, they were much closer to us, so we managed to handle it.

At the very last moment of the day, Cris called me. He took me to an establishment, and I thought it was really cool of him. When we got there, it was a simple diner in an alley. He promised me that the meat wasn’t that kind of meat.

I ordered a sandwich, and it wasn’t too bad to pay for it. I guess my salary really is high.


[Day #14]

I was feeling much better, but it still hurts in my chest that Kim died.

In the locker room, I found Marinel wearing a farm outfit and holding a Christmas-wrapped club. When I asked her about it, she backed away a little—maybe out of shyness?

Another day, more tasks with the skull. I feel more prudent and even more stable. I think that skull isn’t bad after all.

While the so-called Lantern was still loose, Yuju stayed in our room. I went to talk to her, and she seemed really nice, but she was very pessimistic and melancholic about everything. I found it interesting, and we talked a lot. She told me she liked a chocolate sweet called brigadeiro. I wonder if I can find a way to make it?

Another alert went off. We were sent to the Information Team’s room to try and contain it.

The Fragment of the Universe escaped!

That thing the Manager sent us to handle... it looked like a scorpion made of flesh, with distorted palace faces all over its body. It had huge teeth and a needle. I hated looking at it, but I had to start slashing at it with my blade alongside everyone else.

It devoured an employee right in front of me. It was horrifying to see their organs flying across the room. At least it wasn’t anyone from our teams.

When it died, it burst into several of those clown boxes that try to release anomalies. What a bizarre creature!

We split into squads. That little thing was releasing creatures everywhere!

Cris and I were faster than the others. We managed to kill it before it released another anomaly and caused more deaths.

Cris called me to that diner again after everything was over. I was happy but had to wait while he talked to Ms. Malkuth.

As we were walking there, we started talking. He told me he had been promoted and that we did a great job containing that thing. He opened up more about himself.

His family was very poor, and his father sold his own body, replacing it with metal to try and become a Fixer. He said he was proud of his father but was also scared about the end of his family line. He prayed every night for his father to return home alive, but one day, the prayers didn’t work anymore.

He was deeply saddened but had to start working to support what was left of his family. He mentioned that he had worked at the diner he was taking me to, which was why he was so confident that they didn’t use human meat.

Now I understand him better. It’s good to know he trusts me enough to talk about these things. As a thank-you and to show my appreciation, I paid for everything today. I don’t think it’ll affect me too much, and it was worth it—after all, he’s my friend now.

I met him on Eharmony. I had just gotten out of a 13 year relationship with my best friend who turned out to be gay.. I wanted a real relationship and I wanted to have a daughter. So, I jumped into this relationship without fully knowing him and within two months of being together, he bought a house out in the country, in rural Kentucky and we moved out here. Before we moved in together I specifically asked him if he had any skeletons in his closet that would come back to bite us in the ass later down the road and he said no. I asked him if he had a temper and he said no. Everything was going very well. I got pregnant and was so excited I posted about it on Facebook. A little while after that post, his biological mom messaged me. ( he was raised by his grandparents) she warned me to be very cautious in having kids with him because when he was 17, he molested his 4 year old half sister. That was the beginning of the end. I felt very tricked, trapped, disgusted and disturbed hearing about it. I asked him about it and he broke down in tears and said he felt really bad about it, would never do it again etc. unfortunately it was an indelible mark on our budding relationship. I guess due to the stress of finding that out, I had a miscarriage. I feel like I dodged a bullet in many ways. We’ve been having financial difficulties and we without a car, after ours got hit by a train in a freak accident! So he got a job at a local restaurant. 

 He was the opener, he went every day around 5:00 a.m, around 6:00 one of the waitresses would show up and they’d have a few hours together before the rest of the people showed up. He was the cook and the only guy that worked there. I told him he was like a rooster in a hen house. Before he started opening for them he was told who he’d be opening with in the mornings. It was a 17 year old girl. He said he wanted to get a gun to protect her!! We had already discussed getting a gun and that due to his temper, I didn’t feel safe with having one at the house. It was very hurtful and confusing that he wanted to go to such great measures to protect her. The wound up bonding over that fact that they both had deadbeat moms named “ Tabitha “ he told her I was jealous of other girls, and she told him not to tell me anything about there interactions or what they talked about. After finding out about his sister, it made watching nude scenes in movies with him very difficult. I’m not jealous, but insecure. 

 When we first met he asked if we could have a threesome with another girl since I’m a “ tomboy “ and I was devastated. That was a big red flag, that I passed by. While working at the restaurant I had a spine surgery, afterwards, I wasn’t doing very well. I had something called post anesthesia delirium, I get it sometimes after surgeries.. one day while he was at work I called him and told him I felt like I was dying. Apparently he had talked to all the woman there about me being jealous and they had a bad opinion of me without ever meeting me. They told him I was making it up and exaggerating my symptoms for attention and sympathy. Even the next day he went to work and met up with that girl and when all the other people came in, he came home and finally took me to the hospital that I’d had my surgery at. As it turns out, I was in septic shock!!!! Somehow I had gotten an infection inside of my spine and was in the hospital for exactly one month and then for the next month had to go to the hospital daily for antibiotic infusions. I almost died. That was a year ago. 

  In this past year I’ve been getting stronger and feeling more like myself. When he is angry he has two things he likes to say the most. 1. You’re worthless 2. You are nothing but a warm body. I’ve thoroughly explained to him how incredibly hurtful the worthless statement in because I’m adopted and have struggled with self esteem my entire life. Since he owns this house, when ever we argue he kicks me out, not physically but verbally, to where I no longer want to be here. I do all of the cleaning. I ask for help, and he always says he will later, but later never comes. He can be very sweet, and soft spoken, which is what originally drew me in. But as kind and gentle as he can be is equally as mean as he can be. I stay for the good times, during the bad times, I feel very alone, I cry a lot, I am suicidal. Recently I got an offer of a place to stay. A healthy household, where I can bring all of my animals with me and have my own room and everything.. I’ve told my partner this, that I’m thinking about leaving and ever since then, he’s been nicer than he’s been in forever. He brings me coffee, rolls me cigarettes, writes me love notes, draws me flowers, promises me that things will never go back to the way they were, if I just stay and give him one last chance. It’s confusing me and making me rethink my decision to leave. I feel like he is being genuine and is afraid of losing me. I really don’t know what to do. I can’t sit on this fence forever. There are things he’s said and done that I simply cannot get past. Part of me wants to leave, to runaway, to start a new life and the other part wants to stay because if I leave, he will be completely alone, no friends, no family, in the middle of nowhere.

1hz8zha,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1hz8zha/praying_for_a_wife/,Praying for a wife,"Warning, this will be a bit rambly. A couple years ago before I was a believer, I met a really cute and charming girl. We hit it off well and started dating. We seemed to be really compatible, except that she was a Christian and quite serious about it. Well, I was ok with that, until she dropped the bomb that she was saving herself until marriage. I was in no hurry to get married, so in my complete and utter foolishness I decided that was a dealbreaker for me and cut it off with her. And I was kind of a jerk about it too, basically telling her that she should compromise because sticking to that principle is unreasonable in the modern dating world(ugh). Needless to say we cut off all contact after that.

Well, time passes and lo and behold I come to accept Jesus Christ as Lord. Not long after, it hits me what a moron I was for rejecting this girl, and that she is absolutely wife material. Like it makes so much sense it's actually crazy. I want to get back in touch with her but I no longer can(we had previously only messaged on Instagram and she had since unfollowed me). I know where she works, but I'm not about to go up to her and put her on the spot at her workplace. So eventually I decide to write her a short letter, explaining how I've come to Jesus, and that I was a fool and an asshole for my previous actions, then at the end I left my number if she wants to continue the conversation. I go up to her one day and make a little small talk and then hand her the letter. A few days of silence and then I get a text from her thanking me for the message and that she's glad I've found peace in my walk with Christ. Of course I respond trying to continue the conversation, but she doesn't text back. 

Months go by and Christmas rolls around. I send her a Merry Christmas text. She sends one back, we have a brief exchange, but again she stops responding. So that's where I am now. I've been praying about this, asking God that if it's in his will for us to be together then please make it happen, and if it isn't then please remove this desire from me or bring someone new into my life. None of the above has happened. I think about her every day, I have no interest in any other women, I want to love and honor Jesus with her and start a family who does the same. So I wonder, does God just want me to be patient? Should I just ask her if she wants to meet for a coffee? God doesn't seem to be saying anything definitive. So it's frustrating.

-I've stopped drinking tea and coffee with sugar. (Bobba is next, I usually order 50% sugar it will soon be 0%)

-I avoid sugary juices (my tongue is much more sensitive to the abnormal amounts of sugar in ""healthy"" juices.

-I no longer need syrup on my eggs and pancakes in the morning.

I just eat my pancakes with butter. 

-I reduce the amount of sugar in dessert recipes.

-I read the labels on snacks and yogurts to avoid the high sugar levels.

 Yesterday, I received my monthly 350g light roast from my Wakuli subscription, and to my surprise, it’s the same coffee I got back in December: a washed Agaro from Jimma, Ethiopia. Image: https://www.reddit.com/u/telemaqus/s/lmSIqIi2sD  

### Tasting Notes:
- **Jasmine, apricot, & gummy bears**  
- The jasmine note is particularly strong and prominent in this one.  

### Brew Observations:  
I had great results with these beans using a mixed percolation/immersion method on the Switch at ~95°C:  
- **1:13 ratio**: Florality is prominent, rounded out by gummy bear sweetness and mellow acidity.  
- **1:16 ratio**: Becomes tangier as it cools, with lingering sweetness in the aftertaste.  

Regardless of the ratio, the body feels medium rather than light. Mouthfeel can get a little sticky, but note distinction remains clear. If you’re aiming for a lighter cup, experimenting with higher ratios (1:17–1:18) and slightly lower temps might help.  

### Why I’m Trading:
This is my third consecutive month brewing mostly washed coffees, and while I appreciate their clean cups and subtle notes, I find myself craving the juiciness and funkiness of natural, honey, or anaerobic processes.  

Right now, I’ve got a natural Ethiopia Sidamo and a washed Rwanda Gwiza in rotation, and I’d love to trade this sealed bag for something natural or anaerobic roasted recently.  

### About the Coffee:
- **Origin:** Agaro, Jimma, Ethiopia  
- **Process:** Washed  
- **Roast Date:** End of December (visible in pics)  
- **Package:** Unopened and sealed  
- **Location:** Europe (prefer EU-based trades to keep shipping reasonable)  

The roast is uniform and regular light (not ultra-light), so the beans don’t need an extra-long rest period. In my previous lot, quakers and defects were sparse, and the coffee brewed clean.  

### Let’s Trade!  
If you’re in a similar position—holding onto freshly roasted beans you’re not fully in love with—I’d love to hear from you. I’m open to anything light-roasted, especially naturals or anaerobics.

I grew up in a home that was extremely strict about what media we consumed, how we spoke and dressed, who we associated with, going to church, reading the scriptures, practicing music to play in church, the whole thing. 

The one thing that was not disapplined or punished hardly at was anything involving personal safety. I've always been really into extreme sports like rock climbing and dirt biking, but I think that's partly because that's the only excitement that was acceptable. It's only been very recently with a lot of therapy that I've started to reign those things in and be safer about how I approach my hobbies. 

And then there was also the factor that we almost never went to the doctor unless we were like dying. Prayers and blessings and pixie dust were the first line of defense, and modern medicine was a last resort. 

My TBM parents are still extremely belligerent about going to the doctor when they need to and tend to engage in risky activities and don't take great care of their health. I don't know how much of it is blind faith that they will be protected and healed, so nothing bad will happen to them, and how much is an unhealthy cope because you have to cut loose somewhere. 

Recently there have been some very frustrating interactions with my parents where they've refused to evacuate from fires quickly or go to the hospital after a serious injury.

1. Any advice on where to stay/what neighborhoods are good for a tourist to stay in? My girlfriend and I would like to be a Portland hipsters for a few days and take in the music and arts scenes, as well as the coffee shops and such.

2. How can I best immerse myself in Portlands soccer culture? The main reason I am taking this trip is for soccer tourism reasons. Does the team have a museum of its history or anything like that which I can see? Any places or things that are a must see to feel the vibes of Portlands soccer culture?

3. I figured I would want to sit separate from the timbers army so that I can view the legendary spectacle that I have heard it is. However, I really really want to touch the piece of the log that timber joey brings around or heck even get a pic with the guy.

If this post isn't relevant to you, it's OK to demonstrate self-control and keep scrolling without passive-aggressive downvoting and commenting.**

I was a serial overtipper for most of my adult life—partly out of naivete and partly out of feeling obligated. I even tipped a physical therapist once because the screen offered the option! For years, I assumed tipping was expected everywhere, including Starbucks drive-thrus and coffee shop counters.

Last year, I finally decided enough was enough. I've cut back on spending and only tip in certain scenarios now. For example, I no longer go to Starbucks, coffee shops, or order food delivery, but I would still tip a driver if I did. I’ll always tip servers when I eat out (though I rarely dine out anymore).

However, I feel conflicted about tipping in some scenarios and want to hear from **other women in high-cost-of-living (HCOL) cities like NYC, SF, Seattle, or LA**—specifically those who frequent **higher-end salons and spas** (not places like Supercuts).

Here’s my situation:

* **Hair Salon (Colorist & Stylist):**
   * I've been going to the same salon in the SF Bay Area for 10 years and always see the same colorist and stylist. Both are employees, not owners and in this setting, I believe they are salaried/paid hourly employees.
   * The salon started charging a 7.5% ""service fee"" since the pandemic, which I suspect doesn’t go to the stylists.
   * I tip 20% each time.
      * **Color service:** $189 (pre-tax and service fee), every 5 weeks.
      * **Haircut:** $220 (pre-tax and service fee), 2x/year.
      * **Shampoo/blowdry/style:** $103 (pre-tax and service fee), 1-2x/year.
* **Keratin Treatment:**
   * This is done by a stylist at a salon an hour outside of SF (not at the same salon above). She is not the salon owner and is an independent employee (renting a chair).
   * **Cost:** $350, twice a year, and I tip 20%.
* **Brows:**
   * I see a brow artist who owns her business and rents a room in a salon suite. I tip her 20% on a $30 service 1-2x/month.
* **Aesthetician:**
   * I’ve been going to the same aesthetician for 8 years. She owns her business and rents a small studio.
   * She charges $250 for a chemical peel and $165 for facials, and I tip her 20% each time. She is meticulous and goes above and beyond.
* **Manicure/Pedicure:**
   * For mani/pedis in a day spa setting in SF, I purchase packages of 5 at $90 per mani/pedi (not including tip) and tip 20% on the package price. I see the same nail tech each time and she is not the owner.
   * When I go to a regular nail salon for a mani/pedi (e.g., when I’m out of town or visiting a place where I won’t be a regular), I tip 18%.

My tipping priorities have shifted as I’ve become more intentional with spending, but I want to tip fairly for the services I value at places I visit regularly.

**If you’re a woman in a HCOL area who frequents higher-end salons/spas, how much do you tip for these services?**

**Does it matter to you (as far as tipping) if the provider is a business owner or employee?**

**Have you ever asked your provider what most people tip?**

**I'm considering slowly reducing to 18% to get used to the discomfort of not tipping 20% for these services.**",0,1736636917.0,tipping,0,0.25,False

I am leaning tho towards that me feeling worse happens first (because my sex drive will become very low, and thats not related to coffee or anything)

And then at some point it passes and i go right back to being able to feel the wonders of coffee and other things mentioned. I know lyme can do wierd thiings, but i am just having a hard time wrapping my mind around the idea that it could completely block my brain receptors from feeling caffeine or kratom. 

My question is has anyone observed anything similar to this?",1,1736636835.0,Lyme,2,1.0,False

1hz8ibg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hz8ibg,Flooring Advice,"Looking to install flooring, this post will have 2 parts, 1, the color, 2, the material. 

Going for a modern/contemporary vibe with a TV stand and TV on the far wall, with an L shaped sectional in beige/cream. (Nothing ordered yet, just ideas. 
Not a fan of rustic or crazy styles, the kitchen is modern with white cabinets and black quartz countertops, with charcoal LVP tiles (smooth, no transition lines)

I am stuck between LVP for durability and accident resistance, or Engineered hardwood for a more luxurious and warmer feel. 
For reference, the hallway and foyer are original pine hardwood from 1959 (66 years old and in excellent condition) Originally I wasn’t a huge fan of the orange but it’s growing on me, and adds some color and contrast to the home, and I don’t want to spend the money to refinish it. 

The basement was done 14 years ago with coffee color engineered hardwood, and looks and feels really good. 

The kitchen is adjacent to the foyer, and is white cabinets with black quartz countertops, and a charcoal vinyl tile. 

Why or why not do you prefer LVP over Engineered hardwood, or vice versa?

I don’t have pets or kids, not planning to sell the house for a few years if not decades (never know with life)

Second part is the color. 
I am more drawn to lighter woody colors, but talking with some people and the flooring store, they suggest either a close match to the hallway, or a contrast. 
I refuse to put grey, as it was cheap grey LVP that I removed, before it was white carpet (hence the need to lower baseboards, I know shoe moulding, but I hate the look of it so I’m working extra to eliminate the need)

What’s your advice, what color would you put if it were your home? I’d try to stay away from espresso/dark colors because the dirt will annoy the life out of me. Again, no pets or kids.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

She's now 12, and now partially sighted and diabetic, requiring insulin injection twice per day - but she still has the same energy and enthusiasm for life that she had when we met her at the age of 3. 

She came from Battersea dogs and cats home in London, who had received her from a dog warden who had found her as a stray with a broken leg - they fixed her leg, neutered her and looked after her for almost 3 months before she chose us.

She is, without doubt, the most important member of the family, to each person in different ways.

She's simultaneously my mums Teddy bear and since mum's had health issues, her guard dog. 

For dad, she's his faithful friend when he does his morning routine, she sits with him to have her ears tickled while he has his morning coffee, then goes out to have a walk with dad while he feeds the chickens. 

And for me, she's man's best friend. One moment a ferocious staffy playing tug of war, the next sitting on a footstool next to my chair demanding chin scratches 🤣

Little backstory 
I was bought on to a new location in my workplace to fix the coffee setup and to also train staff in barista skills, I fixed the grinder and the auto tamp but I have no experience in setting up a espresso machine ! I tried my best with watching videos etc but I'm at a loss 

There are 2 group heads one is messed up but it's ok but the second one is a total goner

Sometimes I am able to adjust machine settings so that one group head is usable but at some point during the day they go back to their old ways 
I think the machine needs an overall service as it's never had one but here are my questions 
1. Why does it take so long till first drip ? Standard for this machine is about 6/8secs but for example today it was taking 12/15secs with the worse group head taking 20+!!! Most mornings I can set it back to normal but lately I've been having no luck ( yes I changed grind size and amount of coffee in basket )
2. Why does the worse group head randomly extract espresso till just pure water comes out ? ( sometimes if you're lucky it will extract in 40s but sometimes if you don't watch it it will go on for 80sec and end with water

If you come to the drive thru and there’s a car there that you know was there before you , maybe just don’t go in front of them!!!
I went inside from taking orders, sat down for a few minutes, and head back outside to find a truck was diagonal in front of a small car, both of their windows are down shouting at each other. The truck looks out his window at me and says “we’re supposed to just alternate right?” And I say “yes, if we’ve directed you to do so” and he seems SOOOO pleased with himself and says “that’s what I thought.” I had already taken the said small cars order, so I asked the truck to back up so the other car could go by. He backed up maybe a foot, and complained again that the smaller car was pissing him off. The passenger of the truck said something along the lines of “that car is really irritating us, I’m normally a very calm and forgiving person but this is so stupid” (as they cut them off and then screamed at them through an open window). I then tell them that if they could let the car by, their order was already taken and it messes things up for the people inside if you cut someone off, as it mixes up the orders we have on our system. 

They proceed to cut me off three times mid sentence, saying “I don’t care” and start raising their voice at me. I decide that there’s no way to fix stupid, and let them go. I refunded the other cars order for the inconvenience, but this really just ruined the rest of my shift and gave me bad anxiety for the next hour after. 

So, a PSA to all you bros customers, ITS JUST COFFEE. If you know for a fact a car was there before you, JUST WAIT THE EXTRA MINUTE. Let’s not ruin peoples days because of your ego and you thinking you need to be more important than anyone else. It ruins the day of the customer you cut off, and really inconveniences the baristas you give attitude to. ITS JUST COFFEE. YOULL LIVE. ",19,1736636335.0,dutchbros,2,0.95,False

Dublin city Centre is compact, lots of great places to visit in a short time.
Consider the following: start at (bus to if necessary)  Trinity college. Enter via Front Arch, wander around front square, continue on to New Square. If the Museum building (to your right - its the academic building for Geology, not a museum) is unlocked, pop your head in. Gorgeous interior, a hidden gem in Dublin. If you can get a ticket, you can visit the Book of Kells in the Long library... a major historical treasure, however ths will take quite a bit of your time. Go back through Fellows square in Trinity college, through the modern looking building (Arts block) and out the gate at Nassau Street. Pop into the Kilkenny shop, this is a great place to browse and buy all kinds of Irish crafts, art, clothing, blankets, jewelry, etc. They also have a good cafe upstairs. 


Walk up Kildare street. You'll pass Leinster House, the Irish parliament. Beside it is the National Museum of Ireland, well worth a visit. 4000 years of Irish history. Continue up to St Stephen's Green (Shelbourne hotel is a fairly pricy place for afternoon tea if you'd like to try that). Walk into Stephen's green, wander a bit if you want, bear right to exit at Fusiliers arch (the exit at the top of Grafton Street). 

Walk down Grafton Street (high street shopping), enjoying the musicians, stop at any shop that looks appealing. Keep your eye out for a tiny lane to your left that says Powerscourt Townhouse center -if time, permits, go down that lane to a hidden shopping center made from a square of Georgian townhouses. Back to Grafton Street, continuing around Trinity College. Must stop at Bewleys Cafe, a Dublin institution. Have tea/coffee and a cake, or lunch. Some touristy shops here. 

In front of you, opposite the main entry to Trinity college, is an imposing grey stone building surrounded by railings. That's the old Irish Houses of Parliament, now a bank, it's open to the public, you can stick your head in (its also possible to arrange a guided tour). 

Next take a left down Fleet Street to Temple Bar, a popular tourist area. If you have time, continue down Dame Street to Dublin Castle,  Christ Church Cathedral, Guinness Brewery, Kilmainham Gaol (buy tickets in advance). 

A half day trip is to take the Dublin suburban train (Dart) north to Howth (plus cliff walk and lunch) and to Bray (plus walk along the seafront, admire the Victorian homes, peep into the gaudy arcades, walk up Bray head hill). Nice views of the coast along the train line. 

For a day trip from Dublin: consider Glendalough. Ancient monastic settlement, beautiful scenery, mountain walking.  
Powerscourt House. Bus to Eniskerry (nice little village), from there to Powerscourt House. Large formal mansion house, amazing gardens, garden center, some shopping, cafe, walks out from the gardens. Or visit Newgrange, a World Heritage site, one of the earliest human burial sites (older than the pyramids). You’d need to buy tickets in advance. ",6,1736636311.0,irishtourism,2,0.88,False
