Ello ello! My name is Lewis, I'm 29 and from the UK, more specifically the North West.

I'm on the search for someone like minded and just ""gets it"". I'm searching for that connection, that something which just makes you want to fall into things deeper.

I'm interested in getting to know each other on a deeper level, go on dates, have fun and just enjoy life! At this point where I am in my life, I just want to be happy with the person I choose to spend the rest of my life with.

I know what I want from a relationship and I'm not afraid to show it. Someone to be by each others sides through thick and thin, the good and the bad. Who understands you've got to weather the stormy seas to enjoy the good in life.

I work a crazy schedule so I'm available all hours of the day throughout the week.

I value trust and honesty above all else in a relationship. If I can't trust you, what's the point? I'd much rather be hurt than your brutal honesty than your lies and attempts to soften the blow. With that said, I'm not interested in wasting yours or my time. So I'll get it out of the way now that I have a 4 year old child from a previous relationship.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it

I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

A little about me:

5""10, 75KG, slim/athletic build, blue eyes, medium length brown hair/beard.

Selfie time so you can see my in the flesh: https://imgur.com/a/Z17J0qs

When I leave the house I enjoy exploring, hiking, cycling, swimming, trying new experiences, being in nature and going to gigs/festivals.

Some of the stuff I enjoy:

- Hiking/cycling - I love being outdoors
- Listening to heavy metal/rock
- Computer programming (self taught, wanting to turn it into a career. Making my own android game)
- Watching documentaries/anime (give me your best, I need some new shit to watch)
- Playing games (PC gamer at heart. Played a lot of OSRS, Minecraft, Rust to name a few).
- Board games (Terraforming Mars, Scythe, D&D, Gloomhaven etc)

I'm also 420 friendly and enjoy partaking in the devils lettuce.

This year I'm looking to start the gym full time, go rock climbing/bouldering, learn to play the drums and finally get my driving licence!

I'm also in the process of completely redecorating my house from top to bottom. No car but I do have a house.

What I'm looking for in you:

24-34 (not opposed to younger/older but looking for around my age). You don't have to be the same continent/time zone. I'm open to LDR but it has to be with intention. Similar interests and hobbies.

More importantly, you're interested and ready to put in the effort to get to know each other with the intention of things progressing to something serious.

If you're interested in chatting, pop me a quick message and we'll see how things go :).",1,1728009604.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

A huge thank you to the beta testers who worked with our team to capture over 10,000 videos during the past 3 months to get this ready public release.

Automatic Video Capture uses the camera on your phone or tablet to capture a form video of every TechDisc throw and store it in the cloud along with the throw data so you can easily find it later. The app applies slo-mo at the release point (as measured by the TechDisc) so you get consistent-looking videos every time. Throw videos are also viewable on the web app. 

This is our first paid feature, requiring a $10 / month subscription, on a tier we're calling TechDisc Premium. We have lots more planned for this tier focused on training and improvement but our priority for the rest of 2024 will be on building Automatic Video Capture for Android and the web app. 

Grab a tripod, start that 7-day trial and let us know what you think. We'd love to see some shared videos from everyone and see who's turning the key and who's pouring the coffee!

with youtube you need to keep moving & not stay in one box. that’s all they’ve done, they focus on the little kid content like “day in the life” or “back to school” like that era is dead especially now that they are 21.

if she doesn’t want to go out & be in the influencer world, she shouldn’t hold jake back either.

I am guessing those who are excited for AFMF2 have never heard of lossless scaling on steam at all? Or maybe its just that the tool is not that well known? I tested them both and lossless scaling still wins every single time. ",0,1728009112.0,radeon,0,0.33,False
1fvoy4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fvoy4n/aitah_for_not_being_a_good_friend/,AITAH for not being a good friend?,"So I recently got back in touch with an old friend. We were best friends for years and years, and then had a falling out (lets just say she became extremely negative and it was wearing on me, amongst her just not being a good friend anymore in general). A few years went by, and she had an immediate family member die. I reached out to her to send me condolences - first time we spoke in years. I decided to go to the funeral. I hadn't seen her or her family in 4 years. When I saw her, we just embraced and cried and all of these emotions came flooding in. I thought about it all day and really missed her. I realized how short life was and I missed our friendship and believed we probably both changed a lot in the last few years. Everything about our last argument just felt petty. Before I could reach out, she reached out to me first. She told me it was really nice seeing me, and wanted to know if I'd like to grab coffee. And so the following week, we did.

We talked for hours and it was really nice. I know that there was so many things about her that was new, as for me too, but I thought of it like a new friendship - not rekindling an old one. We continued to stay in touch, text, call, and have hung out a couple times since then (about a year). 

She doesn't seem to have much time to get together - everytime we try to make plans, she ends up canceling and blames it on me. ""We should probably cancel tonight.. I'm not feeling well, and I'd really hate for you to get what I have. Plus, I wouldn't be enjoyable company for you!"" Things like that. Okay, no problem. However, she has no problem texting me all day every day... doesn't try to get together, or even talk on the phone.. she will send me NOVELS via text. In my 20s, I guess I could text more, I had more time on my hands. I'm in my mid 30s now and I just can't be texting 24/7 anymore, life is busy. But she doesn't just text normal stuff. All her texts are HEAVY. She will send me a novel about her family member dying and how shes having such a hard time coming to terms with it. I have no idea how to help her with that, and even though I continue to tell her I'm so sorry and that I'm praying for her, I can't do much more. I told her it would be wise to see a therapist, and gave her my therapists info. She now sees my therapist. I thought that might help. It has not. She will still text me day in and out about her struggles in life.. her family member that passed, her grandmom aging, her boyfriend got bit by a dog, her back is hurting her, her job sucks, her coworkers are giving her a hard time.. you get the idea. And worst yet, if she's not throwing a pitty party, she is non stop talking about how in love she is with her boyfriend. She'll send me random pictures of the two of their hands together, or a selfie of them on the beach, ect. I'm like.. cool? I've been married for a while now, and I know that when we were dating, I didn't send any of that stuff to her, because who would really care? Tonight she sent me another long text telling me once again how grateful she is for just the most amazing boyfriend in the world. Then persisted to send a list of 'cute quotes' that he's said to her over the past year that she started keeping record of. 

I really don't know what to say to it all. I can only express sympathy for her troubles so many times. And I don't really know what else to say when she tells me how in love she is with her boyfriend, besides, 'cool.' 

For context, she was single when I was dating my husband at the time and she never expressed interest in my relationship, so I guess part of me never really forgot about that. An example of a time I can remember: When we got engaged, I was over the moon happy. She was one of the first people I called after he proposed and I was so excited to call her and tell her. Her first and only response was, 'Well, I guess it's just me left now.""

There is so much more I can add to this, but this is long as it is.

We can be naked…just sit on a towel. No skin contact on benches.  So Im finally in there naked…and TWICE this week alone I got hit on by a gay guy….well once in the showers…after my sauna session and once in the sauna.  The first guy was creepy and kept just staring at me…especially my crotch…and I told him to buzz off and stop staring at me…he fled quickly.  The second was after I got naked I went in the sauna and put down my towel…there was a skinny guy in there.  I was with my two older buddies…we chit chatted…the guy got in our conversation a few times..and you could tell by his voice and mannerisms he was feminine.

So after 20 minutes I got up and of course my balls and junk were kind of hanging low…heat.  The guy said something about it…I glanced at him and gave him a look of displeasure…but I went to my locker. He soon did too…across from mine.  He then asked me about my music and my sauna cap…and dont i usually wear shorts or underwear?  And then said he liked me with nothing on…I said WHOA buddy…thats enough of that.  Told him I dont swing that way.. So I went to shower….he did to…he finished first….I decided to take a cold shower after my hot one.  Took a few extra minutes…when i got back he was still there..and brushing his teeth.  I dropped my towel and was reaching for my clean underwear and noticed him staring…NOW IM PISSED.

I said HEY BUDDY…this is your last warning….knock it off….he took his toothbrush out and spit in the the sink and then said sorry but he thought I might like to get a cup of coffee with him.  I said look little guy…im flattered but my wife frowns on me dating…especially DUDES.  Then i asked him what part of the LGBT crowd did he think I was in…he said he thought I was a bear like guy…I had no clue…my older buddy LAUGHED his ass off….and told me to google it later…..that was a nasty googling…Im not hairy…im not that tall…yes im kind of muscular but most of all im not into DUDES. Plus to be honest Im not packing…im average all day long…6 inches nothing more…Keeps my wife happy…but im no porn star.

He finally gave up…it was about time…cause I could have crushed him into a powder.  He left and my buddies started to make fun of me…..the worst part is when I told my wife…she said…DAMN you could have at least gotten the coffee for me.",1,1728008913.0,SaunaStories,0,1.0,False

Legal both sides kahit parehas conservative ang parents namin, approved at suportado naman sila. 

Sa loob ng 6 years na yun, may times na puro happy lang, lalo na nung 1st year namin kasi first official relationship namin ang isa't isa. 

Never kami nag out of town na kami lang or magpalate ng sobrang gabi kasi we respect our parents kahit na gusto ko sya makasama ng matagal.

Noong nagkaroon na kami ng mga trabaho, mas busy talaga sya. Ako naman iniintindi ko yun kaya madalas, ako yung pumupunta at naghihintay sa kanya sa trabaho nya (after ng work ko) kahit gabi na out nya. Kakain kami ng mga ilang minuto tapos uwi na kasi pagod na sya at malayo pa uuwian nya (1 hr byahe) at kailangan kong intindihin yun kahit na gusto ko pa sya makasama. ""Intindihin mo sya"", lagi ko pinaaalalahanan sarili ko.

Wala naman akong nararamdaman na nagloloko sya. Talagang workaholic lang sya. May times na nagdedate naman kami mga once a week or after 2 weeks tapos matagal na yung 3 hours na coffee date (may kaunting beg pa ako sa kanya yun na maya maya na kami umuwi haha).

Pero nitong taon, simula na mag wfh ako, imbis na maging madalas pagkikita namin dahil I lived in the area kung saan din ang work nya, hindi pa rin kami nagkikita madalas. Kapag nag video call ako, minsan reject nya kasi antok na raw sya. Kaya madalas nagtatanong muna ako kung ""pwede vc?"" Yung pag vc ko sa kanya ay madalas tinatapos ko agad yung gawain ko para may time na ko sa kanya makipag usap. Pero nireremind ko sa sarili ko na ""intindihin mo sya. Pagod sya"". Kaso paano naman ako na nag e-effort din para makita at makausap lang sya.

Pag sinasabi ko yung nararamdaman ko sa kanya, nagpapasalamat daw sya sa understanding ko. Tapos babawi naman sya ng date at matagal na naman ang kasunod... then repeat.

Normal lang ba to? Or wala na tong  patutunguhan kasi paulit ulit na? I need your thoughts po kasi naiiyak ako madalas na parang ako na lang lagi nag eeffort sa amin pero kailangan ko syang intindihin kasi mahal namin ang isa't isa.

P.S. What I like about him ay yung pagiging matured, responsible, generous, and marespeto nya. Hindi ko naman isasantabi yun. I love him.

Year after year, more people are asking why they’re so tired, as modern life demands more mental effort, leading to fatigue.

Highlights
🧠 Increased decision-making: Modern humans make around 35,000 decisions daily, leading to mental fatigue.
🌙 Sleep challenges: Evolutionary mismatches affect our sleep patterns, contributing to tiredness.
☕ Caffeine dependency: Caffeine blocks sleep signals, causing an afternoon crash when its effects wear off.
💤 Importance of napping: Cultures that embrace afternoon naps report better cognitive functioning and health.
🚫 Information overload: Constant exposure to information adds to decision fatigue and stress.
🔄 Chronotypes matter: Aligning daily schedules with natural sleep patterns can reduce fatigue.
💡 Glutamate buildup: Accumulation of glutamate from decision-making clogs brain function, causing tiredness.
Key Insights
🧩 Complexity of modern life: Unlike our ancestors, we face complex decisions daily. This complexity strains our cognitive resources, leading to fatigue.
🌱 Evolutionary mismatch: Our brains evolved for simpler times, but modern life requires us to adapt quickly, leading to mental exhaustion.
☀️ The role of adenosine: Adenosine accumulates throughout the day, signaling tiredness. Caffeine interrupts this natural process, resulting in crashes.
🕒 The power of coffee naps: Combining a short nap with caffeine intake can enhance energy and mental clarity, maximizing alertness.
⚖️ Benefits of biphasic sleep: Cultures that incorporate naps often experience better health outcomes and mental performance compared to non-nappers.
🗂️ Decision fatigue: The accumulation of decisions creates mental clutter, similar to trash piling up in a city, making further decision-making more challenging.
🔄 Chronotype awareness: Understanding and aligning with your natural sleep preferences can optimize rest and reduce fatigue.",2,1728008801.0,indianews,0,1.0,False

Does exercise make you enraged (like an anti-‘runner’s high’)? Coffee make you calm?,"I’m amazed to learn I’m not the only one who  has an unhangover. I wonder what other quirks we have in common?

I sleep so much better and awake so refreshed and energetic if I go to sleep after drinking spirits. I used to drink straight vodka or gin strategically to feel perky for the morning of big events, like university exams. Otherwise I don’t sleep well and wake up exhausted.

Spirits don’t make me feel tipsy unless I drink a huge amount. Did it once, never again! I can have three or four shots without feeling it, and people think I’m sober. But even a little beer or bubbly makes me very tipsy very quickly, with an awful hangover the next day. I’m learning that it’s not an issue with carbonated alcohol but a histamine intolerance.

Another swapped reactions are that coffee relaxes me. If I am feeling anxious or my heart rate is high, I drink a double espresso. After it kicks in, my watch shows that my heart rate falls. (Not the case for milky coffees—maybe it’s the sugar?) I skip from relaxed to unpleasantly jittery if I have way, way too much caffeine. But I’ve never gotten normal elevated energy from caffeine.

I’ve never had endorphins from exercise. Around the point when they should kick in, I get waves of uncontrollable fury and rage, then total exhaustion. It is so awful that I have effectively avoided exercise, especially cardio, all of my life.

So, I (M19), work in the my college’s financial aid office and recently had one of those rare, super fun conversations with a girl who came in to handle some FAFSA stuff. We ended up making jokes back and forth, and honestly, it felt like there was a real connection there. We had this easy-going vibe; It was probably one of the most fun interactions I’ve had in a while.

After it ended, we were too busy in the office for me to go talk to her outside and get her number. I am kicking myself for not doing it anyway.

now I can make up an excuse to follow up with her because her FAFSA will come in. I plan to call her soon, but I’m nervous about how to go about it. I don’t want to come off as unprofessional or creepy by hinting at anything personal, but at the same time, I’d like to get to know her. I don’t even know if I should do it at all. I was thinking of keeping it professional with the FAFSA update and maybe throwing in a casual coffee invite.

But here’s where I’m stuck: What if she says no? I’m trying to keep it low-pressure and respectful, but I’m worried it might not work. I don’t want to make her uncomfortable.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How would you go about this? Any advice on keeping it professional but leaving room for something more?",1,1728008457.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1fvoqix,https://www.reddit.com/r/knives/comments/1fvoqix/benchmade_prices_are_just_fine/,Benchmade prices are just fine,"Benchmade makes some of the best knives in the world with exceptional craftsmanship, premium materials, and innovative design. The company treats and pays their employees well. Despite the good things about Benchmade knives, these days the newest trend seems to whine about Benchmade's prices. Though the things whiners moan about Benchmade varies, the general idea theme is that Benchmade knives are ""overpriced"" and ""not worth it"".

There’s nothing wrong with Benchmade’s prices IMO. If their knives are selling (and they are!), it means people see the value and are willing to pay for them. Prices are driven by supply, demand, and perceived worth. Like any luxury item, Benchmade knives are not meant for everyone's jeans pocket. And that is OK. They’re for those who appreciate quality and can afford it. Instead of complaining about what they secretly want, those who can’t afford a Benchmade should take it as motivation to save up.

People get outraged over a $240 Osborne, which breaks down to less than 70 cents a day over one year, yet they have no problem spending over $10 a day on bland deli sandwiches across the street from the office. It’s funny how priorities shift when it comes to convenience versus investing in something that lasts. They’ll drop cash on overpriced lunches but complain about a knife that will serve them for years. I know a guy who goes to Starbucks every single morning ($6 coffee), complains about made in America knife prices, but doesn't seem to realize he is literally sipping away a Benchmade Bugout EVERY MONTH.

Overall, I think the whining about Benchmade’s prices is a mix of misplaced priorities, the expectation to get American quality at Chinese prices, and just plain jealousy. People happily drop cash on indulgences like overpriced lunches and $6 coffees, but get mad about investing in a quality, American-made knife that will them decades.

Here's some funny whiner quotes about Benchmade prices I've collected here on r/knives and r/knifeclub:

>""It's honestly embarrassing and disrespectful to the knife community in my opinion.""

>""If you pay four figures for a tiny knife you carry around in your pocket you either have fuck-you money or are mentally ill. Maybe both.""

>""My groceries almost doubled in price as well, fucking Benchmade.""

>""$300 for a Bugout is honestly insultingly insane...""

>""Who gives a shit about those corny guys anyways, fuck benchmade.""

>""I think it's time for a boycott. I do not plan on buying any Benchmades at the new prices. It's a shame.""

>""Idiots with too much money will line up to buy it though.""

>""Benchmade is the Apple of the knife world. Charging more for the name and esthetic. And people happily pay it so they can show off that logo, just like with Apple.""

>""I love my 940 Osbourne very much and paid $180 for it years ago. I’d say it was worth it for how much I use it but more than $200 is absurd""

>""Then they wonder why people buy clones.""",0,1728008364.0,knives,9,0.07,False

As is customary, almost all of my friends brought housewarming gifts. As I do by the way when I attend a housewarming. My friends brought me nice gifts like some good bottles of wine, a very fine whiskey, some type of fancy style coffee beans, several people brought plants as I love plants, and one person even brought me a weird framed art thing with beans in it. 

So as you can see, I appreciate any housewarming gift, whether it is fancy or weird. It is the thought that is appreciated, the acknowledgment of friendship and custom. 

Imagine my astonishment when someone I thought was a friend arrived at my housewarming, to dine on my food and partake of my drinks, to be my honored guest, and brought NO gift. 

I asked them if their housewarming gift was still shipping, or if it was a card of some sort they had on them. They gave me a weird look. I asked again about the gift. 

This person told me they didn't bring me a gift! At first I thought they were joking. But they were serious. I asked again. They said they didn't bring me a gift and were sorry. By now everyone in the party was silent and staring at us. No doubt they were full of shock that someone was behaving so poorly. 

I just couldn't believe it. I demanded that they leave my housewarming party. They asked if I was serious. I said I'd never been more serious in my life and that they couldn't attend a housewarming if they weren't going to warm my house. In fact they were cooling my house if anything. With their frigid ambiance and lack of social graces. I told them if they ever wanted to correct their friendship they would bring me a housewarming gift accordingly. 

It really put a damper on the rest of the party, everyone was so dismayed I assume by the poor antics of my friend. At least I thought they were my friend.

Yet since the party I have heard from 2 people that they think I ""overreacted"" and was rude in my conduct. I was astonished to hear this. I think they must be wrong. Yet I thought I would ask reddit.",0,1728008278.0,AITAH,13,0.14,False

What do I do? How do I get him back? ","I need advice on how to get my boyfriend of 8 years back. After years of resentment and unresolved issues, he started seeing someone else. Now I'm devastated and don’t know what to do.

\*\*\* Please only comment if you think you can provide helpful insights/tips. \*\*\*

**Background:**

For a long time, my boyfriend and I were holding grudges over small, unresolved issues. We would argue but never really address the root problems, and this led to resentment. Over time, we became passive-aggressive and distant. We got stuck in a cycle where neither of us wanted to change unless the other made the first move, which only deepened the problems. Looking back, I realize it was a bunch of small, unrelated incidents that built up because we didn't communicate properly.

I was always mad at him but don't know why, now I have done this reflection and see I was always mad, I feel so horrible.

**The Breaking Point:**

About 6 months ago, after a series of fights (that I don't remember the reasons of), I started ignoring him and even went on a few dates with other people (nothing serious). At the same time, I was also going through a stressful pageant competition, and I didn't have the energy to fix things. He tried to reach out, but I wasn’t responsive. My unresponsiveness peeked 2 months ago, I just finished my competition and I was going through some serious burnout. Then, about four weeks ago, he started talking to a girl on a dating app who had just been dumped by her fiancé. He flew to meet her in New York, and they spent a week together.

\*\* Timeline \*\* I stopped talking to him 2 months ago after my pageant mid-Aug.

He started messaging this girl on dating apps 4 weeks ago, they've been talking for 2 weeks online, and he flew to NY to see her in person, and that was 2 weeks ago.

Her fiance left her 5 weeks ago when they were ring shopping, she started talking to my bf a week after

**He's View:**  
Now he’s told me that he thinks she’s ""the one."" He has introduced her to his parents, set up a joint bank account, and planned 4 international trips together. He says they are very compatible, while our relationship was based on physical attraction.

He think one of the big reason why he no longer wants to be with me is because of our ""baggages"", we had some pretty dramatic bad things happened in the first 2 years of our relationship, I think he doesn't even realize the baggage he is talking about is not a specific event anymore, it's the unresolved grievances between us.

Because of the resentment I had, I wasn't the best girlfriend to him for the past 2 years. I was a great girlfriend before, but I don't think he remembers it anymore, I used to hand sew holes on he's socks, I did all the cooking, cleaning, I always come downstairs to the street to greet him when he comes home, either it's during the day or I am already in bed. I loves him deeply, and I just lost sights in the past 2 years, doesn't this happen to every relationship? I realize what I have done now, and I just want him back.

***\*\* He listed a few things he doesn't like abt me: \*\****

*- I always drink coffee in he's uber, and he is concerned about he's uber ratings*

*- I don't like he's friends and act dismissive around them. (a few of them have done disrespectful things like calling call girls when i was still there, saying nasty sexual jokes to me, or a serial cheater that my best friend got affected. But he's argument is if I love him, I will accept he's friends. Those friends also is a bad influence on him, when they are around, he likes to party till 8am every weekend & do blows)*

***\*\* he listed a few things he likes about the new girl \*\****

*- she made a sign to pick him up at the airport when he arrived*

*- she don't fight with him about things*

*- they have no baggages.*

**How I'm Feeling:**

I am completely devastated. It hurts so much I started to cut myself. I can't eat, can't sleep, and I've lost 8 pounds in a week. I never realized how much he meant to me until I lost him. He was my anchor, I grew up without a father, he is my first male figure in life. Now, I feel lost and don't know how to move on. We had a somewhat codependent relationship, and I can’t imagine life without him.

Even though he has many flaws, but no one is perfect. I accept him for who he is, and I just want to be loyal, sweet, and love him for the rest of my life.

**Where Things Stand Now:**

He told me not to message him anymore, but he hasn't blocked me. Since they are both out of a LTR, he’s made a promise to his new girlfriend not to see me, just like she promised not to go back to her ex-fiancé. Our 8th anniversary is in less than 3 months, and I refuse to accept this outcome.

How can I get him back? He seems to be very disappointed at me for the things I've done, he think I am not a sweet person because if I do care about him I won't fight with him on those small things. I now think he is right.

Also we had huge communication issues before, none of us were introspective enough at the time to see it, but I do now. If we are back together again, I know how to make things better.

\*\*\* Please only comment if you think you can provide helpful insights/tips. \*\*\* 

I know I sound very immature, but this relationship is incredibly complicated, we have been through a lot together. Even though he said he has moved on, but it's also only been a month, I want to do everything I can to get him back.

1fvon3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/copilotmoney/comments/1fvon3j/how_to_budget_savings_investments/,How to budget savings & investments,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been a big fan of Ramit Sethi’s Conscious Spending Plan (CSP) and am trying to format my budget to align with his principles. I’ve been using the Copilot app to manage everything, and I wanted to share my experience so far in hopes of getting some suggestions on optimizing it.

Here’s what I’m working with:

I’ve divided my budget into four main groups to follow the CSP breakdown:

	•	Fixed Costs (50-60%)
	•	Investments (10%)
	•	Savings Goals (5-10%)
	•	Guilt-Free Spending (20-30%)

My challenge has been tracking savings contributions (like for my Emergency Fund or my trip to Italy next year). Since that money isn’t actually spent yet, I want to exclude it from my spending totals to avoid inflating my numbers. However, when I eventually spend on the Italy trip, I want those expenses to reflect in my travel category for accurate tracking.

Right now, I’ve organized my categories like this:

Fixed Costs:

	•	Rent, groceries, utilities, car payments, gas, etc.

Guilt-Free Spending:

	•	Coffee, restaurants, personal care, etc.

Savings Goals:

	•	Emergency Fund, Italy Trip

Investments:

	•	Roth IRA, HSA

When I categorize savings contributions as transfers or exclude them, I can’t budget for them, and the analytics get messy. When I spend on travel, I don’t want to count both the savings contributions and the actual spending, but I still want to track the travel expenses properly.

Has anyone else run into this issue or found a workaround? It’s be cool if Copilot allowed setting budgets for excluded categories, but in the meantime, I’d love any suggestions on how to manage this more efficiently.

I do most of the administrative: phones, greeting clients, efiling, payments, correspondences with court, billing, receiving packages. I am a Notary Public. I also draft motions and petitions, interview clients, prepare exhibits and trial notebooks.

This week I ran into an old university classmate at a networking event. 

My degree was a 5 year course. As mine and this guy’s surnames were near each other in the alphabet, we ended up getting paired/ grouped together a lot throughout the first 4 years. I saw very little of him in our final year. 

My experiences of him in the first 3 years of university were extremely negative. Typical popular jock kinda guy. He was very rude, arrogant and generally intimidating. For whatever reason, he took a disliking to me within our first few weeks of school and he went out of his way to be nasty thereafter. It was honestly a really upsetting and traumatic time and I had to have a lot of support from my family through it. I’m now in therapy about the bullying from him and his friends, amongst other things.

One time in our 3rd year, I stood up to him. I just snapped. He’d been rude again in front of other people and I’d had enough. But needless to say, from here, things changed. I think me snapping instilled some sort of respect for me in him, and his demeanour toward me changed entirely. He began speaking to me softly, complimenting me (e.g. I remember once he told me my voice was calm and soothing), being near me more, and one time on a class night out, he tried to come onto me. Just the one time. We never spoke about/ addressed it after. He was very drunk. He also expressed jealousy one time I was talking about another guy with my girl friend and he was within earshot. So, I figured he become attracted to me in some way. As I said, after that incident in our 3rd year, he changed. He never apologised, but he was nice to me. He started referring to me by an endearing nickname. He would have considered us friends, I’m sure. This continued for the rest of 3rd and 4th year.

Honestly, I never saw him as a friend. I was civil and polite but I always secretly resented him. I felt such deep hurt from him. I’ll admit, it probably was fake of me. But I was just relieved he was not bullying me anymore. I’d been his victim for 2.5 years and I was grateful for a bit of peace, though I never felt comfortable around him. I was always on edge. 

In our final year we mercifully got moved to different groupings and I hardly ever saw him or spoke to him again. When we graduated I removed him off Facebook and Instagram and just wanted to move on with my life. 

As I said, I’m now in therapy and working on my PTSD diagnosis. He and his friends are largely responsible for it, I’m not going to sugarcoat it. Imagine near-daily bullying from grown men for 2.5 years of your early formative adult years. I don’t think I need to say how very damaging it can be for a young woman. 

Fast forward to this week, we’re now just over 3 years out of uni. I haven’t seen him since our final year. I was at a networking event/ conference for my industry, which is a very close-knit industry. 

My stomach drops and dread seizes me when I see him across the conference hall. I hope to God he doesn’t see me too, but he does. Oh does he notice me. He comes over and looks happy to see me. We catch up briefly, and then to my dismay he decides to sit next to me for 2 of the lectures. The feelings I thought I’d been dealing with came rushing up again like a tidal wave. It’s so much easier to ‘forgive and move on’ when you don’t have to see the people who trigger you. But he was right there next to me, acting like old friends… which, I guess, in his mind - we probably are. 

There were 4 other people from our school at the event, people from the years above or below, and after the event ended I was invited to a pub to catch up with the other alumni informally. Of course, he was there too, and decided he wanted to sit next to me again for most of the night. At this point, I was a bit more comfortable. I guess because the initial shock had worn off, and I’d been giving myself mental peptalks for like 4 hours at this point. 

But then, he shocked me entirely at the bar. He came with me to order a drink and paid for mine. There at the bar he admitted that he’d like to see me again, and that he’d thought about me a lot since we graduated. 

I guess with a few drinks down me, I was feeling bold, and also because I’m working on assertiveness. I said something along the lines of, “you’ve been thinking about me? Including all the times you were an absolute dick to me?” I’ll admit, it was satisfying seeing his face drop. Maybe that makes me a bad person, idk. He replied looking very sheepish, “oh yeah.. I’m really sorry about that. I thought we’d put it behind us… I don’t have any excuse.”

I got so mad that I nearly teared up. I don’t think I showed just how mad I was, but I did say “you’re saying sorry now? That seems pretty convenient.” He thought we’d put it behind us? How fucking easy for him. Had he ever apologised or addressed how he’d treated me before that? Was he just saying it now that I’d called him out and he is interested in me? I just excused myself from the bar and went back to sit with everyone else. I didn’t exactly ignore him for the rest of the night, it was an intimate group, but I kept my distance and he seemed to pick up on the cue and left me alone. 

A few days since have passed and it’s been turmoil. Then to top it off, yesterday he sent me a VERY long message request. In short, he apologised for how he treated me at university. He said he genuinely thought we had become friends and moved past it, and that he had noticed I’d unfriended him on social media since graduating but didn’t read too much into it, just thinking that we’d grown apart in our final year. But now he can see that he’s obviously hurt me. He said he’d been unkind to me because I’d rejected his friend in our first year, and that friend had gotten all of his ‘boys’ to turn on me!?! (NEWS TO ME. now I FINALLY know why they were all so horrible!!!) He then went on to say of course that wasn’t an excuse, but it was the honest reason, and he’d grown since he was 18-21 and was a different man now, and that he hopes I can forgive him and give him a chance. He said that “truthfully” he’s liked me for a long time and that he’d like to go for coffee this weekend to talk this all out. 

To be honest, the hurt is so deep. I feel embarrassed knowing his and his friend’s actions have caused me to have PTSD and put me in therapy, whilst he’s been merrily carrying on through life totally unaffected by all everything. 

There are a lot of conflicting emotions. I guess I never felt safe enough til now to express how much he’d hurt me. And a part of me wants him to hurt too; I want to reject him hard, but at the same time I feel the angel on my shoulder telling me to forgive and maybe hear him out. I’m thinking, what about all the times he was nice after? What about the times he tried to make you laugh? What if he has truly changed? But I just don’t believe he could’ve changed that drastically. Could I ever see him romantically? Honestly, he is handsome. And very charismatic. But I feel like it’s a huge betrayal to my 18-21 year old self. It feels like I’m not honouring myself. Those are shallow reasons to be interested in someone, especially after they hurt you. Am I interested in him? Is this something like Stockholm syndrome?

This is the most confusing time of my life. Honestly, I’d rather just not reply and try and pick myself up from this whole ordeal and move forward as I have been trying to do already. I need to see my therapist ASAP but she’s away for 3 weeks so Reddit will have to do. I already know what my parents and sister would say. They hate him and his friends - they were there for me through it all. They know what went down. My sister would say make him cry, rip into him. Tell him you’d never consider him, that you were never friends, that you hated him all along. My parents would say never speak to him again. My dad would honestly beat him up if he could. 

I guess I’m answering my own question? I don’t know why I’m curious about entertaining this.

1fvoik9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Devilcorp/comments/1fvoik9/chapter_two_from_my_book_about_devilcorp/,Chapter Two from my book about DevilCorp,"As I ventured down the dark corridor, I saw a handful of strangers in suits wandering between rooms. They looked both anxious and determined, and too distracted to pay me any mind. There was an air of confusion, as potent as the musty smell lingering in my nostrils. 

It certainly wasn’t your average coffee-infused morning office routine. They clearly ran on something else here. 

Down the hallway and to the left, I stepped into a large, kind of makeshift, ramshackle office. The blinds were shut; it was even darker than the waiting room. The only light was a flickering lamp hanging by a chain from the ceiling, casting an uncertain glow on sheaves of documents scattered over the splintery cabinets and spilling onto the threadbare carpet. 

“Well, well, well,” said a hyponasal voice from a tall, jet-black office chair. “Aren’t you a young buck?”

“Uh, hello,” I said in a shaky voice.

I peered through the gloom. Seated behind a beat-up desk, wearing a wrinkled black suit, and sporting an ugly gold and black patterned tie along with a conceited smile, was the most smug-looking individual I had ever seen in my life. If ever there was a salesey type, he was it. 

“Glad you found the place okay,” he said.

I took a deep breath. “Couldn’t’ve missed it.” 

“The name’s Mick Lucci."" He held out a hand, beckoning me closer. “I’m the owner of Reaction Consulting, Inc. Welcome to my office, kid.”

I kept my hand firmly at my side as I approached his desk. Just from looking at his face, my estimation of this place being nothing more than a scam was solidified. 

“Um, the job ad said that this was Verizon?"" I said, as if I didn’t know this operation was the furthest thing away from a legitimate Fortune 500 enterprise as could be.

“No, no,” he said, a hint of annoyance in his tone. “A lot of applicants have been getting this wrong… We work with Verizon—along with many other big brands out there. Never for them. Understand, we all work for ourselves here.”

I gulped. ""Um, that isn't what the ad said.”

“And just what about the ad stood out to you, kid?” Mick asked.

""Um… Verizon Fios… Marketing opportunity... $70,000 a year to start...""

""Well…"" he said, ""if you're making that much per year—or more—what’s it matter?” A clearly fake smile emerged on his face. “But I’ll talk to Gina about clearing that up for you. Okay?""

“No problem,” I lied.

“Good talk,” he said, followed by awkward silence.

“Have a seat,” he prompted with a too-wide, goblin grin, ever a hint of sarcasm accompanying everything he said. ""Good-looking kid!""  
 
“Ha… Thanks.” 
“What are you, 18?”
“21.”
“Good, good. We like 'em young.”

I sat nervously in the small chair that stood in front of the desk. Mick’s grin evaporated, replaced by a distinctly creepy stare.

“Okay,” he sighed. “The first impression so far doesn’t exactly impress, but let’s see what we’re working with here.”

As he rummaged through the scattered mess of resumes on his desk in search of mine, I took another brief look around the office.

What stood out to me especially were the pristine—as if they never had even been opened—books with motivational titles arranged on the flimsy shelves of slanted bookcases. They were a bit too conveniently positioned to be taken seriously, but they served their purpose all the same. I even saw a couple I recognized: Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill, and The Art of the Deal by Donald Trump.

The screams from farther in started up again, piercing through the walls. There was no doubt as to what they were saying now: “JUICE BABY JUICE!”

“Hah, so, uh, everyone definitely sounds pretty excited,” I said. “I could hear them the moment I walked in the building.”

“That’s because they know just how lucky they are to be here,” said Mick, scanning my resume. 
“Oh wow, really?” I said, trying not to squirm. The longer I sat in that chair, the more uncomfortable it was.

Mick’s smile grew even wider. Much more of that and his face would split in two. “You’ll be just as excited once you realize how lucky you are to be here,” he said, lowering my resume. “Want to take a guess as to why that is?”

I shook my head. “Um, the money?” 
“Of course, that’s part of it,” said Mick, leaning forward. “But I want you to be more specific for me, kid.”

I thought of his motivational books on display. “Financial freedom?” 

He stared at me in silence. 

What the fuck does this guy want from me? I thought.

“Try expedited success,” he said, eventually. “Just imagine if you could fast-track your life’s progress and start making the money you are destined to make in the future, right now. Imagine soaking up years of entrepreneurial experience in just a few short months. This is the kind of opportunity we offer here, kid—the kind of opportunity you can’t get anywhere else. Certainly not as a mere income-capped ‘employee’ of some 9-5 shithole ‘job’ working for a company that doesn’t give a damn about your life, or your dreams, which, yes, should indeed include financial freedom. That’s exactly what I have as an owner of my own company.”

In the pause after his speech, the shouts from deeper in rose to a new crescendo. “BE EXCITED!” they screamed. “BE EXCITED! BE-BE EXCITED!”
 I shuddered. 

“That definitely sounds…appealing,” I said, trying hard to conceal my skepticism. 

At the same time, I found myself slightly intrigued by the what if. There was some truth in what he said—the same kind of truth I’d get from my dad during our one-on-one conversations lately. In a strange and twisted way, Mick sort of came off as a fatherly figure, with his figurative children screaming from the other room.

“Surely your life could use some success in it right now, along with the fulfillment of certain dreams?” asked Mick in a concerned tone.

Remembering all my problems—how bad I believed my life had become—I lowered my head. “Yes.”
“I bet,” said Mick. He raised a clenched fist. “Sometimes, kid, life takes things away from you—rips them away. You have to ask yourself what you’re going to do when that happens. You can crawl into a corner and die, or you can wade through the bullshit—the negativity—and take back what’s yours, along with anything else you want. Understand? You can accept defeat or follow me to redemption. I make winners out of suckers. I make millionaires out of broke fucks.”

He knew nothing about me, but he knew exactly what to say, it seemed, without really saying anything at all. Like those motivational books on his shelves, I knew it was all bullshit. Or maybe I just needed to change my “broke fuck” outlook?
“So, Brendan, I see mostly dead-end 9-to-5’s in your work history,” said Mick, shaking his head at my resume. “Bussing tables, stocking shelves, washing cars… Ugh. Really?”

“Well, yeah,” I said, confused. “Is that an issue?” Despite all my doubts about this place, somehow not being qualified for something I considered beneath me wasn’t something I was willing to come to terms with.

“Luckily for you, not anymore.” Mick flung my resume aside.

My confusion deepened, but it had started to lighten with a very small glimmer of hope. “What do you mean?” 

“9-5 Companies just use their employees for basic tasks and invest nothing in their growth,” said Mick with a scoff. “We, on the other hand, will invest in you, Brendan. The people in this building are the most important part of this business. Not the product, not the CEO. The people.”

“Well, that’s good,” I sat up with a broad smile, inspired by the notion of employees being treated like they actually mattered. I never felt like I mattered at any of the jobs I worked at before this.
“Hmm. I wonder if you’re a worthy investment though,” said Mick, stroking his chin. “Is there an entrepreneur within?”

“Well, yeah,” I said. “I know I have a lot of potential. A lot of drive.” 

Even if I didn’t want the job, I wasn’t about to let this man believe that I didn’t deserve it. 
“Where do you see yourself in six months?” he asked.

“Um, probably financially stable…successful…” I replied, shifting again in my too-small seat, uncomfortable with getting into the real reasons I was here. “Out of debt…”
“Ahh, student loans?” he asked.
“Oh yeah… That’s part of it.”
“How much?”
“Well…” I stopped. But Mick’s open smile accompanied by that awkward silence prompted me to continue. “Um. It’s in the five figures.”
Mick gasped. “Yikes! We have a lot of that here though. So many of us have been sucked into that scam. But the student loan nonsense won’t be a problem for you for long. Soon enough, it won’t even be on your mind. So, tell me, what else?”
“What else what?”

“What kind of problems in your life are you looking to alleviate? Why are you really here?”
I paused. I don’t know why, but I suddenly felt inclined to open up to him even more—with things and feelings I’d kept buried inside me like murdered corpses. “To… stop my childhood home from being foreclosed on by the bank.”

Mick’s eyes widened. “Really? Those bastards!”
I closed my eyes from the weight of my reality. “Yes. My dad lost his job months back. Parents divorced. Now we’re losing the house. My mom took my little brothers and sisters to live with my grandmom. I didn’t go with them. I stayed with my dad because I felt like I needed to step up and be a man. I’m 21! I should be able to take care of my family. Right? I should be able to do something.”
He paused. He even sniffled a bit. “I see, Brendan. You know, we can help you. Hell, I remember paying off my sister’s mortgage a year ago.” He giggled. “I did it because I was bored.”
The flicker of hope swelled to a small but steady flame. “Wait, seriously?”

Mick leaned forward, staring at me ever intensely. “Listen, all those people you hear screaming in the other room, they’re working for me. And one day soon they will have people working for them. At least most of them will. That’s what we do, kid. We make young and hungry people very financially well off. But only the most determined of the lot mind you.”

I furrowed my brows. “How exactly do you do that, Mick?”

For an instant, I could swear his eyes glowed red as he spoke the following words. 
“By putting you through our management training program. By seeing how far you’re willing to take this.” 

I didn’t respond. This all felt wrong. 
“Is there anything else you want to tell me?”
“About what?”
“About your life… About you.”
“Um, not that I can think of,” I said, my guard back up.
Mick smiled and winked. “Plenty of time for us all to learn all about each other,” he said.
“Um, okay?” In all this strangeness, I at least had the sense to press for one crucial detail. The most important one. “So…about the salary for this ‘management training program?’” 
Mick threw it back at me. “What do you want your salary to be?” 

 “Uh…$70,000 is what was advertised,” I said. “And I’m definitely willing to work hard for it, just like I have at every job I’ve ever had.”
“Yes, I believe you are willing to work hard,” said Mick. “But why cap yourself at $70,000? Is $70,000 going to be enough to change your life?”
“Well, uh, not right away,” I said, knowing that kind of money would at least serve to alleviate the desperate circumstances I was currently faced with. 

“If given the opportunity to get paid directly in proportion to how hard 
 you work, how much do you think you would get paid?” asked Mick, smiling pridefully as if this were some great philosophical question. “Does your potential come with a price tag?”
My eyes moved rapidly as I searched for an answer. What did he want from me? It was like he was trying to get me to assemble a jigsaw puzzle in a pitch-black room, to gauge whether I’d quit in frustration or see it through to the end. Or maybe he was limited to the rhetoric found in one of those damned books. 

I breathed and tried to take back control of the conversation. “Look, Mick, I’m just looking to earn a consistent wage for consistent work. This kind of arrangement is exactly what was advertised. I understand the mistake about the Verizon logo. I now know you’re not Verizon. But the salary couldn’t have been a mistake too?” 
Mick shook his head and snickered. “Pfft! Why are you even focusing on base pay? What are you, some kind of loser employee reliant on a loser’s wage?” 

“Um… no? Uncapped commission definitely sounds good to me… but I would need to be guaranteed at least something starting out, you know? And I’d need to know what I’d be doing exactly.”

Mick slapped his desk so hard I jumped. ""Why, kid? Jesus, what the hell has the world come to? Are you not confident in yourself to make as much money as you want if given the opportunity? If you knew what you were missing out on you’d join us in a heartbeat.” 

“Join you doing what though?” 

I was starting to get pissed off. I already knew I wasn’t going to be back once this interview was over. I don’t know why I felt the need to verbally spar with this… corporate creature. 
We stared at each other for a long moment, with his glare especially hateful at this point. He regarded me in deep disappointment, as if I was the one in the wrong. The prick.

“To learn how to be an entrepreneur,” he said softly. Then he crescendoed. “To own your very own business, kid. To be… a millionaire!”
I sighed and shook my head. “I’m sorry. I just don’t understand it.” 

“Clearly not!” Mick surged to his feet. “Maybe we need to give this position to the other person we’ve been considering, since you’re so indecisive about it!” 

“Other person?"" I asked. This time I didn’t try to hide my skepticism. The only other job candidate I’d seen had stormed out of here.

“That’s right,"" he said, pointing towards the empty waiting room. ""We’ve had dozens of people who have interviewed for this opening. I thought you might’ve been the one; you’re young and hardworking—at least according to your resume. But the ambition category is where you seem to be lacking. The confidence factor! And that’s exactly what we’re all about here. All positive traits that we hone every single day on our path towards millions of dollars.” 

His sudden display of anger had thrown me off. I didn’t know what to say. “I, um, just thought it wise to find out more about this before fully committing to it,” I said. “That’s all. I’m not saying I’m not interested in trying this out…”
Why did I say that?

“Hmm,” Mick mused, stroking his chin. “Then I have someone else for you to speak with—one of my team leaders. We’ll see if he can make things clearer for you. We’ll see if he even wants you. Okay, kid? This is your last shot. Time’s almost up for you!” 

I stood up. “All right... That would be agreeable, I suppose.” 

I was glad to escape this interview, even though it felt like I was jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire. 

I knew I should get the hell out of here, but I also felt the urge to stay, to find out more. Just maybe, maybe, there was something to all of this. Like a 1% chance.

But what caused me to ignore the 99% chance that this was all just another bullshit scam show? Curiosity? Boredom? Desperation? Stupidity? Some strange corporate spell? I don’t know. Probably a toxic mixture of them all.

“Your last chance!” Mick reiterated as he led me out of his office. “I would tread carefully if I were you, or you'll be crawling back to the minimum-wage rat race, where you won’t even have a home to live in, let alone a family to make proud.”

Screams seeped through the walls once more. “JUICE!”

1fvoa59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1fvoa59/my_husband_keeps_calling_me_judy_but_thats_not_my/,"My husband keeps calling me Judy… but that’s not my name, and I’m afraid for my life.","I’m sitting here trying not to feel foolish, too scared to leave my bedroom. I don’t know what to do… I’m at my wit’s end. Please help.

My husband is just outside the door and I’m afraid what he’ll do if I… Oh God, that sounds like he’s… no, no let me explain.

Ricky and I were on a hiking trip earlier this week. We were winding along a trail deep in a gorge, and it was just after sunset, so the gorge was dark with shadows. I never saw anything myself, but Ricky swore he spotted a lost child. He went off the path with our dog Gordie. I couldn’t keep up. Eventually he came back, looking anguished. Gordie had apparently run off snarling into the darkness, and he worried our pit bull was going to maul some lost kid out there.

“I don’t know what’s gotten into him,” he said.

Gordie is a good dog most of the time, but he can be aggressive with strangers coming to our home. It wasn’t completely outside the realm of possibility for him to bite if he thought we were threatened. Though it seemed odd a child would trigger that response. I pressed my husband for a description of this child, and he admitted he “didn’t get a good look” but said he thought the kid was “naked” and that he mostly thought it was a child because he heard talking. I suggested he may have heard a baby deer or other animal, and wouldn’t that be something Gordie would be more likely to chase? And wouldn’t a kid, a talking kid, answer our shouts?

He agreed. Even so, we searched awhile longer before the twilight became too dark and we returned to the cabin where we were staying.

The next morning, Gordie was back, scratching at the cabin door. We’d lost the spark for hiking so cut our trip short and drove back home.

That’s when it all got strange.

I have insomnia sometimes, so I stay downstairs watching TV while Ricky sleeps upstairs. I was on the sofa, glazed over watching some late night show, when I heard talking. I assumed it was Ricky. But I couldn’t make out any distinct words. I called out and there was no reply. I went back to watching my show, but a while later heard it start again, so I got up and went into the kitchen.

There was a child in our kitchen. Or at least that was my first impression in the dim lighting. But it wasn’t a child. It was Gordie. Our dog was standing on his hind legs, just standing in the middle of the room, shoelaces of drool dribbling from his jaws, and he was making these grunting sounds. He stopped the moment I came in, and he was back on all fours again, looking at me.

When I told Ricky, he said I must’ve been seeing things.

But I’m telling you, the dog was on his hind legs, trying to talk.

Next morning, Ricky kept teasing me about Gordie and saying stuff to our dog like, “Hey Gordie, grab me a cup of coffee, would ya?” Or “Hey can you answer the phone for me?” Gordie would just stare at him. Honestly he was still acting a little strange but after Ricky’s teasing I was done worrying about the dog, so I left for work.

I was on lunch break when I got the texts from Ricky:

RICKY: Heard talking. Thought it was you but just found Gordie downstairs.

RICKY: Something wrong, he’s making weird noises and think he’s got mange? He’s losing some skin.

RICKY: OMW to vet

I called, but Ricky never talks on the phone while driving so it didn’t surprise me it went to voicemail. I texted him to call me after he got to the vet.

After work, I checked my phone. Ricky hadn’t texted.

On my drive home I tried calling multiple times to no answer.

Ricky was not home. Most vets close by 6pm, so where was my husband? I checked his location on my phone, and to my surprise he wasn’t far at all, maybe ten minutes away.

So I drove out there. It was on a country road, the route we take to the emergency vet. And at first, I didn’t see his car anywhere. I finally found it when I noticed some of the grass flattened beside the road and that his car had veered off into a ditch. By now, the sun was setting. I noticed the driver door open and muddy footprints. Ricky’s phone was in the passenger seat. I followed the tracks but they vanished in the grass and I walked around, calling for Ricky, and stopped when I found Gordie.

Or rather, what was left of Gordie. I should have taken a picture but I was so distressed… it was our Gordie, but it was like something had split him in half like those pig carcasses you see hanging from meat hooks at slaughterhouses. I could count his ribs…

I called the cops. They came out and examined the scene of the accident but after looking at the footprints concluded it was only Ricky who’d been out here. They seemed to suspect my husband must have done this to Gordie, even though I told them Ricky had been on the way to the vet. I started to tell them about Gordie’s weird behavior the night before, but that *really* made them skeptical. I wanted them to go full crime scene and tape off the area and take photos, but apparently that kind of investigation is not done for dead dogs.

When I came home, I was exhausted and upset. I saw lights on in the house. Relief washed over me because that meant Ricky was home!

But when I opened the front door the first thing I noticed was the dirt tracked inside. Ricky and I always remove our shoes when entering. Also, I could hear him talking, but it was just like Gordie the other night. Talking but not talking. These odd syllables, like someone mimicking the act of talking.

All of this chilled me to the bone as I crept around the corner so I could see him in the den, standing there, unnaturally stiff and straight, sort of swaying. I called, “Honey?”

His gibberish immediately ceased. His head turned, and—I swear, it was like he reached up, and folded his skin over his face. Like a sticker that has started to peel at the corner and that he smoothed back into place. I heard him say, very clearly this time, “Honey?”

I ran. I ran upstairs to our bedroom and slammed the door and locked it. I could hear him roaming around outside. Occasionally he called for me, “Honey?”

I’d dropped my phone in the hallway. I was too scared to go and grab it. Instead I stayed hidden up here, listening to the sound of the TV downstairs. At one point, the news anchor said, “Reports of sunny weather coming up!”

And I heard Ricky’s voice, clear and distinct: “Sunny weather coming up!” Then he cleared his throat and called loudly, “Honey, reports of sunny weather coming up!”

Every so often he came up to try a new phrase on me. The last time he came upstairs, I was sobbing and yelled through the door, “What about Gordie? What the fuck happened to Gordie?”

He laughed—laughed! A weird, high-pitched laugh that sounded just like a laugh from a woman on TV. Not at all like his normal laugh. And he said, “Gordie’s fine, honey. Gordie’s fine.”

“My name’s not ‘honey’!” I shouted back. “Call me by name! You know my name. It’s Judy!”

“Open the door, Judy, honey,” he said. “Judy! Open the door!”

But my name’s not Judy, either. It’s *Claire*. Judy is his mother’s name. Whatever is down there wearing my husband’s face—it’s far, far too clever, the way it tried to quickly reassure me. And I know I have to call the police and tell them something’s wrong and that if they interview him, they’ll see, he won’t be able to answer correctly. They’ll realize something’s not right.

I finally managed to creep out and grab my phone and sneak back in while he was still watching television.

But now I’m terrified because right after I scurried back in and locked the door, he came up—he must have heard me—and he knocked.

And I am so chilled. I’m not sure if I can convince police of the danger now. Because this last time, after he so very politely knocked, he said, “Honey?”

He said it smugly, confidently. “Honey, open up. Everything’s fine. Claire, honey, open the door, [Claire.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)",7,1728006936.0,Odd_directions,2,1.0,False

My wife and I have been together for over 17, married for 5 and have a son. Like most we’ve had ups and downs but have always trusted and love one another.

The last couple of years have been stressful with money and building a house. We recently moved into our new house and things have been great, better than ever really. We are connected emotionally and sexually and are having fun with one another again.

Yesterday was her birthday and I noticed her phone was laying around while she was in the toilet so I thought I’d surprise her with a dick pic on her phone, when I grabbed it I noticed WhatsApp and opened. We have never hidden anything from each other so I didn’t think it was a big deal or think twice about it.

The convo was opened to a male ex-work mate J who she is friends with and sees for walks, coffee and goes to entertainment events with, generally with another of her work mates who also happens to be a close friend of mine, P.

Anyway, I looked at the convo and noticed she had sent him a pic of her in semi-revealing lingerie, a picture she had sent me a few days earlier because I told her I liked her in that outfit. My brain and heart broke and I put the phone down without reading or looking any further.

I took 5-10mins to gather my thoughts and talked to her about it. She knew it was stupid and inappropriate but said she didn’t see it as a sexual thing as they were discussing gym progress and she trusted him. I found out that early on in their friendship she had a crush on him but has never and would never act on it. But the part that broke me was he had sent her topless pic of himself showing gym progress and he is in much better shape than I have ever been, a boundary was crossed, yet they thought nothing of it.

We both didn’t sleep much that night, she is worried she ruined everything and I’ll leave her. My dreams were fucked up, with him topless and her in lingerie laughing at how stupid I am.

I love my wife and want for us to stay together and to trust her. I don’t want to worry when she gets a msg or goes on walking or coffee dates with friends.

On one hand I want her to fuck J off out of her life, they crossed a boundary and I don’t know if I can trust them together, on the other hand I don’t want to be controlling, and what happens if she finds another male friend, will I be uncomfortable, jealous, trusting?

I don’t know who to talk too cause all of my friends are our friends, and I don’t want to ruin their views on her, that's why I’m writing this I guess.

I’m not sure if I am overreacting, I’m sad, exhausted, angry, broken, hurt, insecure, jealous, lonely and feel incredibly stupid. It’s unfair that my world’s broken and I have to put back the pieces.",17,1728006844.0,Marriage,47,0.9,False

It is impossible to determine whether this is related to the GERD or not, given that my GERD is mostly silent, and there is no correlation between when/what I eat and the GERD or dizziness. There's not even a strong correlation between the GERD symptoms and the dizziness.

1fvo6p8,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1fvo6p8/considering_quitting_current_shop_looking_for/,considering quitting current shop - looking for advice,"hi y'all.

i've been working at my current coffee shop for about 6 months now and i love it. after having a week off due to being sick, i'm realizing how stressful the job is. i would love advice if it is worth quitting and applying to other jobs.

pros of current:

* staff team is AMAZING. everyone is nice and fun and i get along with everyone. i think i'm even well liked which is insane to me lmao.
* the customers are polite and friendly.
* pay is good. 16.5 an hour plus average 5 dollar per hour tip.
* drink/food quality i am very proud of. each drink i make and each food item i put out is high quality and would truly recommend to people.
* never seen anyone i know from high school. because of this it feels like a safe space.

cons of current:

* a little understaffed. on weekdays, there are two people from open to noon, then two people from noon to 2-3, and then closer is alone until 5:30 close. weekends/friday will have 3 people in the morning and then the last person to leave the closer by themselves will stay til 4. most of the time working alone is fine but sometimes there are insane rushes randomly and it sucks when working the morning and the other person needs to take their 15 min or 30 min break and u're stuck with the rush alone. taking orders/heating up food/making drinks/plating foods is intense with two people, let alone one.
* working alone at night. it's a safe area and light out at 6:30 but there's two men seperately, who will stay until after i kick everyone out and then leave my shift an hour later. one guy comes in 20 mins before i kick everyone else out. i am allowed to tell him to leave but it's uncomfortable bc everyone lets them stay.
* again staffing issue but i will be on bar with tickets on the line and be doing dishes at the same time.
* i feel like i'm underpaid for the amount of work i do. when working with others, i typically do feel like i'm always the one working the most (cleaning, restocking, etc). i could totally be off though. it stresses me out to the point i was sick for an entire week last week.

when comparing my current shop to the two shops i'm considering applying to, quick some pros and cons:

pros:

* went in once, very well staffed. the other shop doesn't do sit downs so take out only.
* much closer commute by 10 mins both places.
* one shop pays 18.5, idk the other

cons:

* the one shop that does take out only, i might hate it because i hate waste
* will definitely see people from high school during breaks/summers including guy who sa'd me
* crowded town. i would plan to park close to freeway and just walk 10-15 mins (which i love so partly a pro)
* have no idea if the team will be as amazing as it was before. i've been bullied at high school and even at previous jobs. i got so lucky with this current team.

i haven't even applied and might not even get these jobs. i'm planning on talking to my current manager and having a real heart to heart. she's amazing and we get along good but there's a lot of stuff we don't see eye to eye. ",0,1728006625.0,barista,2,0.5,False
1fvo6j0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1fvo6j0/to_the_old_gentleman_at_the_cafe/,To the Old Gentleman at the Cafe,"I opened the door to the cafe, not really knowing what to expect. It was my first time there, and though I’d seen pictures online, I wasn’t quite sure if the atmosphere would accept me. I’m clearly not the target demographic; most patrons inside were a few decades older than me. Including you.

You were the first person my eyes fell upon. You were sat in the corner invested deep into a book. When the door shut behind me, the noise grabbed your attention, and you peered up past the pages nestled inside your book. I flashed you a smile, and you returned one in my direction. In that moment, I felt all anxiety wash away from my core, as I felt welcome. 

I ordered a coffee, and settled on a pink vintage couch a few steps next to you. I pulled out my own book and started reading. I got through a few chapters before I saw a figure approach me in my peripherals. It was you. “I hope to see you here again” you said with a thick French accent, and turned on your heels to walk out before I got a chance to reply. 

You didn’t leave me with your name or contact information. Just a singular sentence. At first, it filled me with delight. But the more I thought about it, the more lonely I felt. Lonelier than I’ve felt in the past few months. 

You couldn’t have known that I haven’t talked to anyone besides my parents in the past three months. That despite reaching out to friends, or attempting to make new friends, I always find myself left on read. This was the first interaction I’ve had in a long time. And even though it made me feel seen, I did not feel heard.

However, as our friendship progressed, I began to notice something quite troubling about her views on relationships.

One evening, over a cup of coffee, Holly started sharing her thoughts on a recent novel we had both read. The book had a complex love triangle that ended with the protagonist making a difficult decision between two equally compelling suitors. Instead of discussing the characters' motivations or the narrative arc, she spun off into a tangent about how in real life, one should never settle for less than a partner who can fulfill every conceivable desire and anticipate every emotional need. She spoke of ""soulmates"" as if they were mythical creatures destined to complete us in every way, and she was adamant that everyone was entitled to this level of perfection.

I tried to gently steer the conversation towards a more realistic viewpoint, suggesting that relationships are about compromise and growth. But she was insistent that true love meant never having to compromise and that any partner who didn't live up to these lofty standards wasn't worth the time of day.

This was only the tip of the iceberg. As we grew closer, she would regale me with tales of her dates, which often ended dramatically due to her unrealistic expectations. One guy was ""too short,"" another didn't have the ""right kind of career,"" and yet another didn't text her back within five minutes of her sending a message. She had a laundry list of reasons why these relationships couldn't work out, and she seemed utterly shocked each time things didn't pan out.

Her theories grew more extreme. She spoke about ""love at first sight"" as if it were a scientific law, and she was certain that she could detect if someone was ""the one"" based on their handshake. She believed in destiny to the point where she would break off promising relationships because she had a ""bad feeling"" about the future, even when everything in the present was going well.

One particularly shocking instance involved her breaking up with a seemingly kind and thoughtful guy because he didn't get her a ""perfect"" birthday present. It was a book she had hinted at wanting, but he had gotten her the paperback version instead of the hardcover. She was livid, claiming it was a sign that he didn't truly understand her soul.

Her behavior became increasingly controversial. She would often give unsolicited advice to others in the group about their relationships, pushing her fantastical beliefs onto them. Some members found her charmingly romantic, but others, like myself, were concerned about the potential damage her expectations could cause.

After a particularly heated discussion where she claimed that any couple not sharing the same interests was ""doomed,"" I decided I had had enough. I knew that if I didn't speak up, our friendship would continue down a path of frustration and disappointment for both of us.

I told her that while I enjoyed our book-related conversations, I couldn't support her unrealistic views on relationships. I tried to explain that love is about accepting people for who they are, flaws and all and that expecting perfection was a recipe for disaster. She looked at me with genuine shock, as if I had just told her that the Earth was flat.

The fallout was swift. She accused me of not understanding the depth of true love and being jaded by my ""mediocre"" marriage. She said that I was trying to hold her back from finding her ""one true soulmate."" I felt like I had been slapped in the face. Here I was, trying to be a good friend and provide a grounded perspective, and she saw it as an attack on her very essence.

Now, I'm the villain of the book club. Some members have sided with me, saying that her expectations are unhealthy and unrealistic. Others think I'm an insensitive prude for not supporting her romantic ideals.

Did I do the right thing by rejecting her friendship over this? Am I the asshole for not embracing her fairy-tale view of love? Or should I have just kept my mouth shut and allowed her to live in her fantasy world?",4,1728006285.0,AITAH,9,1.0,False

I don’t know what to do… I’m at my wit’s end. Please help.

My husband is just outside the door and I’m afraid what he’ll do if I… Oh God, that sounds like he’s… no, no let me explain.

Ricky and I were on a hiking trip earlier this week. We were winding along a trail deep in a gorge, and it was just after sunset, so the gorge was dark with shadows. I never saw anything myself, but Ricky swore he spotted a lost child. He went off the path with our dog Gordie. I couldn’t keep up. Eventually he came back, looking anguished. Gordie had apparently run off snarling into the darkness, and he worried our pit bull was going to maul some lost kid out there.

“I don’t know what’s gotten into him,” he said.

Gordie is a good dog most of the time, but he can be aggressive with strangers coming to our home. It wasn’t completely outside the realm of possibility for him to bite if he thought we were threatened. Though it seemed odd a child would trigger that response. I pressed my husband for a description of this child, and he admitted he “didn’t get a good look” but said he thought the kid was “naked” and that he mostly thought it was a child because he heard talking. I suggested he may have heard a baby deer or other animal, and wouldn’t that be something Gordie would be more likely to chase? And wouldn’t a kid, a talking kid, answer our shouts?

He agreed. Even so, we searched awhile longer before the twilight became too dark and we returned to the cabin where we were staying.

The next morning, Gordie was back, scratching at the cabin door. We’d lost the spark for hiking so cut our trip short and drove back home.

That’s when it all got strange.

I have insomnia sometimes, so I stay downstairs watching TV while Ricky sleeps upstairs. I was on the sofa, glazed over watching some late night show, when I heard talking. I assumed it was Ricky. But I couldn’t make out any distinct words. I called out and there was no reply. I went back to watching my show, but a while later heard it start again, so I got up and went into the kitchen.

There was a child in our kitchen. Or at least that was my first impression in the dim lighting. But it wasn’t a child. It was Gordie. Our dog was standing on his hind legs, just standing in the middle of the room, shoelaces of drool dribbling from his jaws, and he was making these grunting sounds. He stopped the moment I came in, and he was back on all fours again, looking at me.

When I told Ricky, he said I must’ve been seeing things.

But I’m telling you, the dog was on his hind legs, trying to talk.

Next morning, Ricky kept teasing me about Gordie and saying stuff to our dog like, “Hey Gordie, grab me a cup of coffee, would ya?” Or “Hey can you answer the phone for me?” Gordie would just stare at him. Honestly he was still acting a little strange but after Ricky’s teasing I was done worrying about the dog, so I left for work.

I was on lunch break when I got the texts from Ricky:

RICKY: Heard talking. Thought it was you but just found Gordie downstairs.

RICKY: Something wrong, he’s making weird noises and think he’s got mange? He’s losing some skin.

RICKY: OMW to vet

I called, but Ricky never talks on the phone while driving so it didn’t surprise me it went to voicemail. I texted him to call me after he got to the vet.

After work, I checked my phone. Ricky hadn’t texted.

On my drive home I tried calling multiple times to no answer.

Ricky was not home. Most vets close by 6pm, so where was my husband? I checked his location on my phone, and to my surprise he wasn’t far at all, maybe ten minutes away.

So I drove out there. It was on a country road, the route we take to the emergency vet. And at first, I didn’t see his car anywhere. I finally found it when I noticed some of the grass flattened beside the road and that his car had veered off into a ditch. By now, the sun was setting. I noticed the driver door open and muddy footprints. Ricky’s phone was in the passenger seat. I followed the tracks but they vanished in the grass and I walked around, calling for Ricky, and stopped when I found Gordie.

Or rather, what was left of Gordie. I should have taken a picture but I was so distressed… it was our Gordie, but it was like something had split him in half like those pig carcasses you see hanging from meat hooks at slaughterhouses. I could count his ribs…

I called the cops. They came out and examined the scene of the accident but after looking at the footprints concluded it was only Ricky who’d been out here. They seemed to suspect my husband must have done this to Gordie, even though I told them Ricky had been on the way to the vet. I started to tell them about Gordie’s weird behavior the night before, but that *really* made them skeptical. I wanted them to go full crime scene and tape off the area and take photos, but apparently that kind of investigation is not done for dead dogs.

When I came home, I was exhausted and upset. I saw lights on in the house. Relief washed over me because that meant Ricky was home!

But when I opened the front door the first thing I noticed was the dirt tracked inside. Ricky and I always remove our shoes when entering. Also, I could hear him talking, but it was just like Gordie the other night. Talking but not talking. These odd syllables, like someone mimicking the act of talking.

All of this chilled me to the bone as I crept around the corner so I could see him in the den, standing there, unnaturally stiff and straight, sort of swaying. I called, “Honey?”

His gibberish immediately ceased. His head turned, and—I swear, it was like he reached up, and folded his skin over his face. Like a sticker that has started to peel at the corner and that he smoothed back into place. I heard him say, very clearly this time, “Honey?”

I ran. I ran upstairs to our bedroom and slammed the door and locked it. I could hear him roaming around outside. Occasionally he called for me, “Honey?”

I’d dropped my phone in the hallway. I was too scared to go and grab it. Instead I stayed hidden up here, listening to the sound of the TV downstairs. At one point, the news anchor said, “Reports of sunny weather coming up!”

And I heard Ricky’s voice, clear and distinct: “Sunny weather coming up!” Then he cleared his throat and called loudly, “Honey, reports of sunny weather coming up!”

Every so often he came up to try a new phrase on me. The last time he came upstairs, I was sobbing and yelled through the door, “What about Gordie? What the fuck happened to Gordie?”

He laughed—laughed! A weird, high-pitched laugh that sounded just like a laugh from a woman on TV. Not at all like his normal laugh. And he said, “Gordie’s fine, honey. Gordie’s fine.”

“My name’s not ‘honey’!” I shouted back. “Call me by name! You know my name. It’s Judy!”

“Open the door, Judy, honey,” he said. “Judy! Open the door!”

But my name’s not Judy, either. It’s *Claire*. Judy is his mother’s name. Whatever is down there wearing my husband’s face—it’s far, far too clever, the way it tried to quickly reassure me. And I know I have to call the police and tell them something’s wrong and that if they interview him, they’ll see, he won’t be able to answer correctly. They’ll realize something’s not right.

I finally managed to creep out and grab my phone and sneak back in while he was still watching television.

But now I’m terrified because right after I scurried back in and locked the door, he came up—he must have heard me—and he knocked.

And I am so chilled. I’m not sure if I can convince police of the danger now. Because this last time, after he so very politely knocked, he said, “Honey?”

He said it smugly, confidently. “Honey, open up. Everything’s fine. Claire, honey, open the door, [Claire.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)",36,1728005621.0,nosleep,3,1.0,False

1fvnuo0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fvnuo0,Does this room have a cohesive style so far?,"Note: the rug and sofa cushions are dark green in case you can’t tell on pics, also sorry it’s messy, just need quick advice before proceeding with DIY this week. 

My partner and I moved in here about 3 months ago, it was our first unfurnished place and we don’t have much money so we’ve been trying to build it up slowly. 

My initial vision was a 2000s futuristic style, like what you’d see in old IKEA catalogues - this inspired the coffee table, white sofa and its cushions. Since then though I feel like it might have strayed away from this as we’ve been eager to get it looking decorated while being constrained to a budget and the current style in shops. Does it look cohesive still? 

We’re currently in the process of building a side table for the corner next to the sofa, I was planning to paint this a burnt orange with a white border on the top with rounded edges.

We’re also planning to get a standing lamp to go behind the table and put up a photo wall with green or orange frames. The beanbag sofas in the corner don’t live there permanently they’re just for guests (and hard to take up and down 2 flights of stairs), we want an ikea poang chair but this will be a long term goal. Any thoughts on these ideas would be appreciated!

I also want to paint some canvasses for the wall behind the sofa - any advice on styles to go for would be great, it’ll have to be something quite simple.",4,1728005564.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

And Fen Remembered...



""If the Nanites don't come with you when you visit here while linking, then we can use that to our advantage."" Ma-ren said nodding firmly.



""But how, Ma? As soon as the link completes, I'm back where I was, with a memory of what I'm doing here. The Nanites will figure it out."" Fen looked around. They were outdoors, deep in an ancient forest. Based on the descriptions of her family, this was probably somewhere in ancient K'lax.



""Leave that to me, Fen. In fact, leave it all to me. The best way for you not to be compromised is for you not to know anything!""



""Even this conversation can tip them off!"" Fen wailed.



""It's okay, let me try something, I learned it while waiting for you. Another K'laxi told me about it, he was some kind of neurologist."" Ma took Fen's head in her small, furred hands and pressed her forehead to hers.



\*\*\*\*



""Ma! It's so awful. Every time I have to do things 'like an Empress' I feel myself slipping. It's so *easy* to just order people around. I barely have to use the Voice, and when I do, everyone jumps like I shocked them. I hate it... but I also like it, and that worries me.""



Fen tried to use the wormhole links as often as she dared. Ma wasn't going to tell her the plan, but she had to do her best to not make it obvious. She'd gate around the galaxy almost as much. Her times with Ma weren't nearly enough, yet she knew how lucky she was to be able to see her... dead wife at all.



""It's good that it worries you Fen, hold onto that. I can see how that kind of power is appealing. If it helps, you are always you, and I love you. Remember that, and I think you'll be fine."" Once again, Ma pressed her forehead to Fen's.



\*\*\*\*



Fen's normal joy was absent this time. ""Fen, my love, what's wrong?""



""I... I went back home."" Fen sat on the ground heavily. Ma sat next to her carefully and said nothing.



""I went back to our home, and I found the person who shot you, and I ordered them to stop breathing. I watched them suffocate in front of me."" Fen wasn't looking at Ma. ""Then, I annexed the station from the Gren, and took Tam'itar captive.""



""How did that make you feel, my love?""



""I was satisfied. I thought I'd be happy, but there was just this grim satisfaction. Like, a balance of the scales.""



""I... can see why you're feel that way, but you know that you didn't have to do that for me, right?"" Ma-ren looked out at the forest. ""Being dead has given me... perspective. Sometimes, things happen. They are neither good or bad, they just are.""



Fen looked at Ma-ren now, her eyes welling. ""Are you dead, or is this my imagination?""



Ma leaned her head against Fen's shoulder. ""Does it matter?""



\*\*\*\*



""Right there, oh yes, that's nice..."" Ma-ren rumbled in satisfaction. ""I have some K'laxi coming your way.""



""What? How?"" Fen was sitting on the mossy ground and Ma was in her lap. Fen was stroking the fur between her large ears.



""You're not the only person who does this when they link. I found an ancestor of a K'laxi scientist. They do amazing work with matter and antimatter.""



""Huh?"" Fen continued to scritch Ma as she grinned wickedly.



""Don't worry about it. If some K'laxi approach you looking for work, give it to them. That's all you need to know."" Ma turned around and like every time, pressed her forehead to Fen's.



\*\*\*\*



I've met someone, Ma! Her name is Penny. She started out as my assistant but she was so pretty and then she started coming onto me, and I really liked her and..."" Fen blushed. ""I'm sorry Ma, I think I made a bad choice.""



Ma-ren laughed. Fen's blush deepened. ""Fen my love, I'm *dead*. It's not cheating if I'm dead. Honestly, I'm glad you found someone to share intimacy with."" She looked at Fen and her ears and tail twitched. ""Tell me about her.""



\*\*\*\*



Northern sacrificed herself Ma! She streaked down towards the palace like she was going to crash into it! I think she was trying to rescue me and Zhe."" This time, Fen's head was in Ma's lap, and the K'laxi stroked the side of Fen's head, working her hair behind her ears. ""It only took a single of Han'iel's missiles to take her out too."" Fen sighed. ""I miss her. I'll never see her while linking, and I'll never get to tell her what was going on.""



Ma-ren continued to stroke Fen's hair. ""I'm sorry Fen, I really am. I wish I got to meet Northern, she sounded like a true friend.""



""It was just so... pointless. I couldn't so anything, couldn't say anything. She was coming down, the missile was coming up, then there was a blinding flash, and she was gone."" She looked up at Ma. ""Han'iel's antimatter worked perfectly.""



\*\*\*\*



""It's time, my love."" Ma stood a long stride away from Fen. Instead of her usual coveralls that she wore nearly all the time they were together on the Gren station, she was dressed in a brown tunic that was tied at her waist, and went down to her knees. Across her right shoulder was a gold sash, and she had silver earrings. A traditional traveling outfit. ""Han'iel knows the code phrase to unlock these memories. The fact that you haven't been destroyed by the Nanites means that the mental lock is working, I'm so glad."" Fen smiled sadly. ""All the pieces are in place, all the players know their roles.""



""All the players?""



""Han'iel isn't the only one in on this. It's mostly - though not all - K'laxi, but you'll see why once it starts."" Ma-ren crossed the distance to Fen, and embraced her tightly. ""Remember, my love. No matter how this goes, we'll be together soon.""



\*\*\*\*



*Ma-ren utemia lak'men*. Ma-ren, your eternal love.



Tears ran freely from Fen's eyes as the memories came flooding back. All those times she had linked, she had visited with Ma. They had spoke, touched, laughed, and planned.



*What is happening?* *What did you do?*



""You know what?"" Fen thought. ""I actually have no idea. But, I'm excited to find out.""



*No! It does not matter. We have already won. We are at the white hole. We have all the energy we need to do* ***anything***. All your planning and scheming is futile. *Do you think yourself to be the first Empress to try and free yourselves from us?*



""No, I do not."" Fen breathed carefully through her nose and looked up at Han'iel. He nodded once. ""But, with Ma-ren - my wife's - help, I think I will be the first to succeed.""



Han'iel looked over his pad and then back at Fen. ""It looks like the memory block was released. Good. You'll understand then, why I won't be removing the gag?""



Fen nodded.



""For now, I'm going to leave you strapped down as well. From what I understand from the records, the Nanites took control of your body when you went with Empress Raaden.""



Fen nodded again.



""I can make things more comfortable though."" Han'iel fussed with a panel out of Fen's line of sight, and the table she was on tipped up until she was almost standing. A panel slid out to support her feet, and pads inflated on her back and rear. If she didn't think about the restraints, it was almost like she was casually leaning against a comfortable wall.



Almost.



As soon as Fen was upright, she heard a booming clang, and a noise like rain on a roof.



""Ah, that will be the beacons."" Han'iel said, nodding to himself. ""About fifteen thousand of them all told. It took me more than a month to program the yacht to clandestinely print them without alerting anyone.



*Fifteen thousand beacons? Why? That doesn't make any sense. You need to work yourself Free Fen. We need to know what's going on.*



""No, I don't think I will. I trust Ma and I trust Han'iel. I trust my friends. We're going to see what they have planned.""



\*\*\*\*



Gord and Chloe hung back watching things unfold on super long range telescopes.



""I don't get it."" Gord said. ""Fen's yacht got to within one AU of the white hole, deployed the gate, and then... nothing? She's not going through, she's not turning back to the flotilla. She's just... sitting there.""



""Maybe there's some kind of Builder rite she has to do. Have you ever seen her deploy a gate before? Melody said that a lot of their stuff was almost like a religion.""



""Yeah, but that was those people on the Reach. The Nanites don't strike me as the religious type, they're pragmatic. If pretending to be a religion gets their gates out, they'll do it. If Fen doesn't swing that way, they'll probably just ignore it."" Gord took a sip of coffee, hot and black while they watched. Chloe had a cup of chamomile tea, a K'laxi blend.



Suddenly, their ship squealed, and the telescoped zoomed in on the yacht. The image was a few light minutes old at this distance, but they still watched as a... cloud of something came out of the bottom of the yacht, and then there was a sparkle of wormhole links all around her, like fireflies in the summer.



""Beacons! Thousands of them!"" Gord shouted. ""What the hell does that mean? What the hellfire is she doing?""



""Something has started, clearly. Look over there."" Chloe touched the controls, and the view switched to another telescope watching the expeditionary force.



It was under attack.



By K'laxi ships.



""By Bobby Or's stick, what are they doing?"" Gord said as Chloe raised an eyebrow at the oath. ""They're going at them hammer and tongs!""



The K'laxi warships were flitting around the expeditionary force, chain linking three or four times, then firing missiles, and linking again. They were using a tremendous amount of power. Gord estimated that if they were using human reactors, each ship had to have at least a half dozen to be able to use that much power. He had never heard of K'laxi ever using more than two.



It was working though. The smaller K'laxi ships were too fast for the large, slower expeditionary force. The Imperial ships were designed for long term deployments and exploration. They weren't warships. That's not to say they weren't armed, but the K'laxi frigates were winning the fight. One of the smaller human ships suddenly exploded in a huge white fireball, the edges with black tendrils that reached into space.



""They blew their reactor! The ship must have taken a mortal wound!"" Gord said, and looked at Chloe. ""Are those ships AI?""



""One moment, Gord."" Chloe's eyes flashed blue and she stared into the middle distance while she did research. ""No. Those were all middle empire ships, with no provision for AI crew members.""



""Thank goodness for small favors at least."" Gord leaned back in his chair as the vinyl squeaked and complained. ""Let's wait until the K'laxi are done. If they don't capture survivors, we can scoop them up."" While the battle was ongoing, the flashes of the thousands of beacons around Fen's yacht dissipated. ""Something tells me the Empire is going to be too busy in a few hours to rescue anyone.""

1fvnptj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fvnptj/the_things_you_see_at_sea_rust/,The Things You See at Sea: Rust,"Everyone who works at sea knows there are some things you just don't talk about with shore people. Like the magic pipe, or where the extra money came from for the crew welfare fund after passing through the Suez Canal, or just quite how close you came to crushing that little wooden fishing boat off the coast of Vietnam. Things they wouldn't get, that would tarnish the image of the gentleman captain and his well oiled crew; standing to attention in their crisp white shirts and shiny golden threaded epaulettes. But beyond that, deeper than things they wouldn't understand are things they shouldn't understand. Things that people who haven't spent time out there, thousands of miles from civilization, where the lines between reality and what lies beyond get thin, and blurry, and sometimes vanish altogether should never know. Things that would make your skin crawl and the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Things that would leave the average landsman barely clinging onto the edge of sanity by the thinnest of margins. Things I'm going to share with you.

What you need to understand, before I begin in earnest, is that so far out at sea things get…fuzzy. My pet theory is that the collective consciousness of humanity gets thin out there, so far from everyone else. The barrier of logic and faith and the knowledge of what is and can be and what isn't and can't simply doesn't extend so far out as to cover the open ocean, days or weeks from anywhere that could even generously be described as inhabited. Other sailors have their own theories, ghosts and aliens and ancient slumbering gods. All at least somewhat true but I don't think any of us quite have everything right. I don't think any of us could get everything right, at least not without slipping too far beyond rationality to ever come back. Some just accept it for what it is and give it no thought whatsoever, I envy them. But what's important is the fuzziness of it all. The moment that reality crosses into unreality is rarely noticeable until you're already knee deep in impossibility.

So that's the context. That's what you need to understand for you to truly comprehend the things I've seen, and heard, and felt, and become. This is your last chance to back out. If you're still reading, I would commend your bravery if I weren't so certain it was ignorance rather than courage that propelled you.

My first experience with that slow fade into what lies beyond rational thought is the one that sticks with me the most. That's the way for most seamen I've spoken to, you never forget the moment you realise you've crossed the line into unreality, the feeling of something in your mind warping as all the logic you've built your life on twists to the point it snaps, and you accept the impossible to be true.

If there is one thing that defines a life working at sea it's rust. It drives almost every action you take when working on deck. Finding rust, removing rust, preventing rust. Chipping and painting: the deck cadet's bread and butter.

The process is actually a rather satisfying one. When I first started as a cadet it was almost therapeutic. You start out with a jet chisel, a collection of long blunt ended needles connected to a handle, powered by pressurised air. When you squeeze the trigger the needles fire back and forth at high speed, shattering the paintwork below them in a satisfying burst, revealing the corrosion underneath. It appears quite violent at first but in actuality the needles aren't moving fast enough to cause you any harm. That's the key you see, where the metal has rusted the paint layered above it loses adhesion, and weakens. The force required to break it is minimal, which means the chisel itself doesn't need much power. It's how you know you've reached the edge of a patch of rust: the metal beneath begins to turn from a tarnished black to a more reflective silver, and the paint becomes much harder to remove.

From there comes the wire brushing. Removing the rust and sanding down the edges of the remaining paint using a high speed rotating brush, with bristles made of coarse steel. Not quite as satisfying as the chipping, but arguably more important. What's the point in knowing where the rust is if you just let it spread? Whilst this looks less violent than the process of chipping it's actually far more likely to cause you harm than using a jet chisel ever would. The wire bristles are likely to fly off at speed, and I've lost count of the amount of times I've almost had one embed itself into my throat, stopped only by the neck gaiter I wear for exactly these situations. And of course that's assuming you don't need to use Metalbrite. A horrific corrosive concoction with the stench of synthetic chemicals that burns at your nose hairs and sticks in the back of your throat. Truly awful stuff, but fantastic at removing rust; within minutes it can have even the most stubborn patches looking almost new, but god help you if you got any of it on your hands. But hey, that's why we wear PPE. Boiler suits, gloves, goggles, dust masks. All designed to keep us safe from errant bristles, corrosive chemicals and lungfuls of iron oxide as it's stripped from the metal it once called home.

There was something so satisfying about revealing a large patch of rust, starting from the centre and following it as it grew, reaching out to spread further and further throughout the steel until you find its maximum extent. It was strangely beautiful to see the different shades and colours in a particularly big section. The blacks and browns of old long rusted portions, pockmarked with the vibrant, almost unnatural orange of fresh spots where the rust had only just begun to take hold. It always fascinated me, the way it would spread. It was almost like a living organism, a parasite, but instead of feeding on its host it incorporated it into itself. Taking the iron from within the steel structure and converting it into Iron Oxide. Millimeter by millimeter, each atom converted becoming another vector from which it can transmit.

Occasionally I would find a spot underneath the paint that looked as though it had bubbled up from within. These spots were so soft you could fracture the paint simply by pressing it with you finger, the paint slowly giving way beneath the pressure before suddenly collapsing with a satisfying snapping feeling beneath your finger tip. And once the paint broke the cause of the bubble became clear, as the salt water trapped beneath the paint trickled out through the cracks, leaving behind a trail of orange-brown streaks as it went.

That's how my first two months at sea went. For four hours every morning, nothing but chipping alongside the deck ratings. Ratings are really the ones who keep the ship running. Officers may know how the Gas Combustion Unit functions or be able to tell you every rule under the Collision Avoidance Regulations, but if you need anything fixed, replaced, painted or polished, the ratings are who you go to. And that's who I spent my first month with. When I wasn't on the bridge learning how to keep watch with the Chief Officer, a stern Scottish man who had a look in his eye that he was always expecting trouble to bubble up out of nowhere, I was with the deck guys chipping away at the rust.

I usually worked with an AB called Max. He was a fair bit older than me, mid forties I'd have guessed but I never bothered to ask. He'd served for years as an Able Bodied Seaman in the company, and absolutely adored his job. We'd often talk about why we'd come to sea, and what we'd done before making the leap, and he'd say ""Matt, every day here is an adventure. You'll see things you never even dreamed of. Just stick with me and I'll see you through!"" And so I did. For the first two months everything Max did, I did. Admittedly most of that was limited to chipping and wire brushing but he kept me right.

We were sailing back to the Suez Canal from the West Coast of India when Max took ill. He'd forgotten to roll down his sleeves when brushing down a particularly stubborn patch of rust on the underside of a mooring winch and taken a needle to the arm. It hadn't been enough to stop him at the time, barely even breaking the skin, but when he complained of an itching sensation the Chief Mate told him to take some rash cream from the medical locker and take the day off.

The day he returned to work, Max initially seemed fine, working as usual, but he seemed almost hesitant to use the wire brush. It seemed a natural enough reaction at first glance, worrying about the accident, it could potentially have been far worse than a scratch to the arm if he'd been unlucky so of course he'd want to take his time. And that's what all the guys assumed. ""Oh Max is just being overly careful, he'll get over it"" I heard one of them, a man named Frederico say to the other guys over coffee. But I had spent the whole morning with him and it seemed more than that. He still scratched ferociously at his forearm where he'd been struck by the needle when he thought no one was looking, and recoiled visibly from the sound of a wire brush whirring. But he still worked fine, and otherwise seems his normal self, so I chalked it up to fright from the accident and left him to it.

Cadets tend to get weekends off whilst at sea, and I didn't see much of Max until Monday. Usually he could be found after work watching a film in the crew lounge or playing basketball out on the poop deck, but that weekend I only caught glimpses of him heading to or from his cabin, which struck me as odd. I asked him about it when I saw him on the Monday morning but he just said something about feeling tired and not being able to get much sleep. And from the looks of him he really had struggled to get some rest in. His eyes were bloodshot with deep bags beneath them and, although he tried to hide it, his forearm was red raw where he had been scratching at it. I tried to tell him to talk to Chief about it, maybe get some stronger medicine from the locker, but he just said he was fine and he didn't want to make a fuss.

That day I noticed Max becoming even more hesitant with the wire-brush, and at one point I saw him physically recoil as I pressed the brush against the steel and sent the rust flying into the air. It was a particularly advanced case, on the strong point of the ship's railings designed to lash lifeboat to in an emergency. The brush wasn't quite doing the job so I asked Max to grab me a bucket full of Metalbrite, but instead of going to fill one up he looked at me with a sad, almost pained expression.

“Can't you hear it?” he asked, turning to face me. Confused, I took a step back and asked him what he meant. 
“The rust” he replied stepping towards me “It sings so beautifully if you know how to listen.” At this point I began to worry, I thought maybe the needle had given him and infection and he'd begun to become delirious so I ran to get the Chief officer to make sure he was okay, since he was the closest thing to a doctor we had onboard. By the time we got back Max was working away as though nothing happened, and when I tried to explain to the Chief what had happened he just told me he'd keep an eye on him, and to take the rest of the morning off.

That night as I was trying to sleep I woke to a familiar sound. The metallic rattle of chipping needles firing into a bulkhead. Initially I shot upright, sure I'd overslept, but my clock read 3am, and it was still dark out. Confused, I began throwing on a boiler suit to head put onto deck and see what was happening. I wasn't going to be able to sleep with the noise and I was confused as to why anyone would be on deck so early. Stopping to grab a torch from the rack in the cargo control room, I walked into the deck slowly, not wanting to trip on the myriad of compressed air nozzles and hydrants that dotted the area, until I saw the source of the noise. 

Hunched in the darkness, a chipping gun in hand, was Max. I couldn't quite see what he was working on from where I was stood but as I shone the light over his back the rattling stopped. “Matt, is that you?” he asked, barely shifting from where he was squatting on the deck. “I knew you'd come, I knew you could hear it too”. Confused, I asked him what he was talking about, mentally trying to work out how I'd be able to get him inside and down to the sick bay. He slowly rose from his position hunched over himself as he replied “The rust of course. It sings of such beautiful corruption. It wants to connect us, to grow with us. Tell me you can hear it Matt”.

Before I could formulate a response he turned towards me and my breath caught in my throat. I can't put into words the thoughts that ran through my head when I saw him. Every emotion I had ever felt in my life was dwarfed in that moment by sheer unadulterated terror. The skin on the right side of his face was cracked and peeling, revealing a dull brown stain spreading across the blackened flesh beneath, pocked with a network of virulent orange spots like veins across the surface. His right eye was missing completely, the empty socket oozing saltwater, leaving brown streaks down what little remained of his skin on that side of his face, staining the pristine white of his boiler suit.

I staggered back, tripping on a compressed air hookup and landing on my back, knocking the wind out of me. I tried to scramble backwards as he approached me but to no avail. He leaned over me, the salt water soaking into my boiler suit as he reached down to grab me by the collar. Panicked, I attempted to loosen his grip, but my hand recoiled as I grasped his arm and felt the familiar sensation of paint crumbling beneath my touch as salt water begin to leak from underneath the skin where I had grabbed him. “Don't worry Matt. I'll teach you how to hear it. You can be just like me”

He raised me up from the deck and held me aloft by the front of my boiler suit, part of his lips flaking off and falling to the deck below, revealing pristine white teeth in stark contrast to the decay continuing to spread its way across his face. I wish I could say I saved myself, that with a flash of genius and some heroic surge of strength I managed to escape, but I didn't. Fortunately the chief mate did. He'dbeen observing Max for some time from the bridge, when he saw me on deck. He swung a prybar at the back of Max's head, connecting at the base of the skull with a metallic clash, the vibrations of which I could feel as it reverberated through his body into his hands. A second swing and he had dropped me, a third and he was on his knees, but the Chief didn't stop swinging. Blow after blow came down from overhead until the back of Max's skull was dented inwards, as if his head had been deflated from the inside.

“Get the Metalbrite” he said once he was sure Max was still. “I'll tell the captain we need to call in a man overboard” I hesitated, a fairly natural response I'd argue, but chief was adamant that there was no time to waste and so I ran down to the chemical store and came up with two full jugs. I never heard the rust sing, but I'll never forget the way it screamed as we poured the metalbrite over what used to be Max. A cacophony of metallic grating and screeching, completely artificial yet somehow the agony was palpable regardless. Agony, and sorrow. In that moment I understood the pain the rust was feeling, the pain of being presented with a feast the size of a super tanker but denied at every turn, of being reviled simply for existing where it had no choice but to. I almost felt pity as I set down the first emlty jug, until I remembered the iron grip on my shirt, and the man I called a mentor. At that I opened the second and emptied it out too.

From there, I was debriefed by the chief mate and the captain. Max was to be declared an overnight man overboard, with no chance of rescue, and the scope of what I had signed up for finally revealed to me. The smarter part of me wanted to quit, I was so close to leaving and never coming back, but something in me wanted to stay. I tell people it was the money, or the chance to see the world. But honestly looking back, the morbid part of me wanted to know more about what went on so far out to sea, where humans have no business being. Unfortunately that desire has been indulged many times since, but I'll leave it there as this has already gotten longer than I intended, and retelling this has got me breaking out in itches. Luckily we just stocked back up on metalbrite. ",2,1728005142.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

We were vibing all night and had a good connection/energy together. I tried meeting up with her a few different times that year and it never advanced to the point of picking a day where she was available so I eventually dropped it. We kept in touch through socials here and there.

We met again in July at an event and got to chatting once more. A few weeks later, she asked me out on a coffee date. I ask her when is she available and she literally replies ""that's a good question haha"". I suggested a day the following week, but that day came and went without a meet.

Why ask someone out and then not proceed with scheduling? I can't make any sense out of it. I'm done trying for a date with her but I'm just curious about this.",1,1728004622.0,dating,3,1.0,False

I thought I'd share my personal experiences with five supplements I tried from Amazon. 

**Ashwagandha by NutriRise**

I started with Ashwagandha because I heard so many good things about it. 

This one from NutriRise is high potency and includes black pepper for better absorption. 

After a couple of weeks, I noticed a reduction in my anxiety levels and I felt calmer.

The capsules are easy to swallow and I didn't experience any side effects. The only downside is that it took a little time to kick in, so you have to be patient.

**Nature's Bounty Magnesium**

This supplement improved my sleep quality, I fell asleep faster and slept more soundly. 

It also helped reduce muscle tension I usually get from stress. The tablets are a bit large, which might be hard for some people to swallow. 

Also, taking too much can cause digestive issues but I didn't have any problems with it because I just stick to the recommended dose.

**NOW Foods L-Theanine**

I felt more relaxed without any drowsiness, which was great for staying focused at work. 

It seemed to take effect relatively quickly. One thing I appreciated is that it didn't interact with my morning coffee, in fact, I didn’t have caffeine jitters. 

The only con is that the effects are subtle so it's not a dramatic change but still helpful for me.

**Gaia Herbs Lemon Balm**

I added it to my tea in the evenings and it helped me unwind after a long day. 

It has a pleasant, mild taste, and I felt it ease my nervous tension. On the flip side, the dropper can be a bit messy and it's another step to add to my routine. 

Also, since it's liquid, it's not convenient for traveling.

**Nature's Way Valerian Root**

It definitely made me feel more relaxed and helped me drift off to sleep easier. 

However, I didn’t like the strong unpleasant smell. The capsules are a decent size, but the odor can still be off-putting. 

I also felt a bit groggy the next morning if I took it too late at night. No major side effects or whatsoever, but it's something to be mindful of.

**Conclusion**

Out of all these, **Ashwagandha by NutriRise** was the most effective for me because it really reduced my anxiety levels without any side effects and I felt more balanced overall. 

Of course, everyone's experience can be different, so what worked for me might not work the same for you.

Her disposition is still fun, playful. She’s always been a good sleeper and used to stay up until 11 sometimes to watch a show or movie. She moved near me about 20 months ago and her bedtime became 8:30-9. Routine is dinner around 5-5:30 in the dining room, some TV w/me or sister, health aids come with eyedrops, we leave, she calls my brother and then goes to bed. She sleeps solid until about 8:30 and was going to exercise class or coffee during the weekdays. In the last month, she is missing most exercise classes, getting up and going back to bed. Surprised at how late it is when we call (say 10 ish). But most startling is 4x this past week she has thought it was time for bed as early as 3pm and around 6-6:30pm. She is reminded that the eyedrops people are still coming and today at 4, that she hadn’t had dinner yet. Soooo, is this the beginning of the sleeping more phase, could it fluctuate before becoming a permanent change? Should we put in a temporary camera to get a feel for her sleep habits?

From what I can gather, a lover is someone you can open up to sexually, an Anam Cara is someone you can open up to spiritually, and a deep friendship is someone you can open up to about everything else. Is that kind of the idea?

Is there a great significance to be put on having an Anam Cara? Can you have multiple? Is everyone you meet for group ceremonies automatically an Anam Cara to you?

I do my best to provide my child with the things he needs and be a positive role model. 

Having said that, right now in my life I’m lacking that special someone, as cliche as it may be.

I’m a bit of a hopeless romantic and still kinda believe there is someone out there for me.

I’ve done the online dating apps and it’s not really for me. Browsing profiles and swiping left or right is a weird experience for me. 

“Ah yes this girl looks cute, likes coffee, gym, walking and movie/music, I’m sure we will be a great match based on allllll of this information.” 

L O L 

You get the point, so I’m here on Reddit, I’m sure some people at this point are rolling their eyes, but frankly put I’ve had many more great conversations on Reddit with people than I’ve ever had with people on dating apps. 

A little about me;

I’ve had some issues over the last 3 or 4 months that have been frustrating, to say the least. It started with some swallowing issues that were diagnosed as muscle tension dysphagia. Something that happened simultaneously was a feeling of something in my right nostril after eating/drinking. A swallowing test shows nothing going up there, but the sensation would happen 70 percent out of the time after a meal.

For the last 4 weeks, that feeling is has turned into **nasal burning**, with occasional throbbing in the right nasal region/right sinus area, with some tension headaches as well.  As well, that pain can be present on the right side of my throat, an inch above the collar bone.

Rarely it presents in the soft palate area on the right side. But, usually centered in the right nasal region. Some weeks are ok, but some weeks are much worse. It’s really hard for me to find a trigger on what makes it good or bad. 

Like, as an example I was fine all day today. I had one decaf coffee at a cafe, which in the past has been fine, and suddenly I feel bad enough I had to go home.

**X-ray showed no infection**, steroid spray did nothing. My speech-language pathologist said LPR was a possibility but my GP sort of dismissed that possibility. My GP tried giving me gabapentin to see if it was nerve pain, with no change. I see an allergist in 2 weeks and an ENT in 5 weeks. That doesn’t seem long, but this burning nostril is really wearing me down.

I’m just curious if anyone has any thoughts, or other users have experienced something similar and if they had anything I could try in the meantime. Thanks!",1,1728003520.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1fvn6lw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1fvn6lw/houses_on_a_graveyard_update_14_investigation_2/,Houses On A Graveyard (Update 14) (Investigation #2),"So, in this update some really interesting things has happened at my house, so that means this is going to be a VERY long post and for anyone that has doubts, this whole story as crazy as it is going to sound was recorded on video on multiple cameras and recorders. I couldn't make this up even if I tried, lol.

It's odd to say, but I have gotten used to not understanding everything that happens in the house. It's even weirder to say I have kind of gotten used to seeing the stuff that happens. Whenever an object moves, or we see a door close. My wife and I point it out. However, we don't react like we used to a year ago when we started to get the constant activity. I guess it has become our ""norm,"" as you can say. However, it hasn't stopped me trying to figure out how to learn more about whatever or whoever is at the house. Luckily, I have been in the AV / Automation Industry for nearly 2 decades, so that helped me figure out how to do EVPs using the voice memo app and Audacity to go through the audio. I find the process oddly enjoyable, and it helps that the house is pretty much always active. But I always want to know more. So I reached out to a paranormal group that is Houston based, and they seemed nice enough and really got excited when they learned where I live. It always baffles me that my community is so well known in the Texas paranormal community. So anyways, I sent them the pictures and EVP's that I have managed to get, and they were impressed with my work. They said they were aware of the history of my community and were also aware that paranormal investigators weren't exactly welcome in our community due to the way some have harassed the area where the first homes of the community were built and so if a paranormal investigator is in the area, people aren't very kind to them. The local group said they wanted to investigate my house based on the evidence I provided as well as help them move on. Now, I am not a religious guy, and neither is my wife. I am not looking to cast the entities out since they aren't really disrupting anything, but I am also not interested in keeping or trapping anything. So, if that's something they do, cool. give whatever it is a choice. I guess that was a choice the entities didn't want....

So, the group came to the house with a wagon of goodies. They have camcorders, Thermo-cam, light up cat balls, an orange device that measured temperatures and barometric pressure, voice recorders, a motion detector, and an EMF detector Upon arriving, they set up a webcam for an investigator who couldn't make it but was willing to call out if he saw anything. They also sketched the layout of the house and then took thermal base reading around the house. At this time, they were in the kitchen, and they were able to capture a tall female figure against my coffee bar area. My first reaction was, is the surface reflective? No, its wood thats painted but not shiny and the figure was cold and transparent, you could see my coffee maker though it and it was a full figure that covered other things on the counter that aren't reflective. If anyone is curious to see, I'll post the picture. 

After the excitement died down from this and they set up all the equipment. They started the investigation by turning off the lights and sitting on the couch and introducing themselves. They stated names and intentions, and this is where the first EVP was caught. The lead investigator asked if the entities would talk to him because they obviously have talked to me (the homeowner), so they should talk to him. I think this was said oddly because the EVP that came though said ""talk? Can you talk?"" It was an odd response, and keep in mind, these responses were found after the investigation was completed. The next response came after the lead investigator asked if the entity was alone. The EVP response was ""take a hint."" It was kind of odd to hear these responses as they had never acted in that manner with me. 

In the next part of the investigation, they used dowsing rods. I personally don't believe in them because there can be too much human influence but at the same time, they do make me curious as if you read my past posts, at my neighbor's house, their little girl used them and had a name of a entity that was repeated in an EVP that was caught there, as well they have been used to find water, so there might be a little merit there? I don't know. Anyways, the lead investigator asked a series of interesting questions. Like how far their grave from the house was, is there more than the 2 entities here. This is where the 3rd EVP came into play and is interesting. A new voice I have never heard before very clearly said ""yes."" Now it is to be said that the investigator was getting his own answers using the rods, and that answer matched the dowsing rods. Then, the next question changed the whole dynamics of the investigation. He asked if they needed help moving on. The dowsing rods said yes. They stopped what they were doing and came to find out that the dude that was on the webcam was an ordained minister. He immediately said a prayer, and it seemed they were convinced the ghosts were gone and they were about to get ready to leave. Suddenly, I personally felt uneasy. It was like I was on caffeine, and I hadn't had anything to eat. Something felt wrong, and I had never felt that way in my own investigations. The house matched the way I felt, and the orange thing (sorry, I don't know the technical name) registered that it registered a 6 degree drop in a 30 min span. This orange thing had an SD card and spit out an Exell like data sheet, and it told every min the temperature and pressure. This baffled the investigators because they eventually told me they were hoping they would be able to help me not have ghosts anymore by helping them move on and I'd hopefully recommend them to the community, and they could discretely help others move on. I don't think there was a malicious act behind it. However, maybe if there was a negative motivation, my house didn't like it. 

After they felt the temperature change, they sat with me on the couch, wondering what to do. They discussed that now, they may have created a flood gate into my house (I am happy to report, this didn't happen.) of entities looking to move on and they needed to comeback and figure out what to do. The lead investigator almost looked defeated. It was really weird and almost awkward. He asked the priest on the webcam what he thought of the situation and what to do. The priest reminded him that I never asked for them to get rid of the ghosts, and I was only looking to make contact. Eventually, the lead investigator looked at me and was like, ""Well, why don't we try and do the investigation the way you usually do it?"" I was like, ok. I told them the steps my wife and I took, and he said, ""Well, lead on."" He followed me with a camcorder.

So, I took my phone and started recording like I usually do. Now, keep in mind, I don't know the EVPs yet, so i don't know if the entities had left or moved on, so I was searching on what to say because what if? So, I asked if Abigail (a name that has popped up over multiple EVPs) if she was still there. As we are in the kitchen, a single EVP of a familiar sounding voice says ""Abigail, Abigail."" I did the same thing in the Playroom. I felt odd at the fact that I had no idea what happened, and that really changed the questions I'd usually ask other than, are there new entities here? I used to just ask about other EVP's I had caught in the past, and it gave me something to at least talk about. At this time, I caught another EVP that said my sons name. After the playroom, we went to my daughter's room. While everyone was perfectly still, the motion detector that was placed facing my daughters room started to go off. We started to ask questions, and it seemed the motion detector was acting randomly so can't say one way or the other if it was paranormal or not. However, on the recorder was a different story. There were 2 separate EVPs that say GET OUT. Whatever is here was mad either what happened, or they were mad they were in that room, but they definitely weren't pleased. We moved to my son's room, but there was nothing that happened in there, and after this, the paranormal team packed up and left. 

I am happy to report things have returned to ""our"" normal, the usual things that happen, and no more things out of the ordinary has happened, and the house feels normal. This was a weird night and not one that I was looking to repeat. If I do investigations, I think I'll invest in my own stuff and do it myself.

I mention this because, according to some studies I’ve read, AFAB individuals are disproportionately affected by parosmia. I also wonder if the vaccines or Paxlovid affect AFAB individuals differently due to historic/continued lack of a comprehensive understanding of AFAB individuals’ bodies in clinical trials. I’m not a scientist or medical professional, though.

I’m triple-vaxxed (Pfizer). I got COVID in Dec. 2023, which my fiancé miraculously didn’t catch despite continuing to share a bed. I took Paxlovid a few days in and it left a terrible, medicinal taste in my mouth and throat for a few hours after taking each dose, known as “Paxlovid Mouth”. A day or two after starting the medicine I lost my sense of taste and smell, but could still sense the intense bitterness of the medicine.
I think it took a couple weeks before I started to be able to smell & taste again. Everything was muted or one-profile; it was difficult to pick out individual tastes. I remember things tasted a bit odd at first, then things tasted as they should, but continued to be muted.

Around Feb. 2024 the phantom smell started: the smell of rotting vegetables or a dying animal following me around from home to work and back home again, like it was embedded in my nasal canal and throat, so strong I thought it was coating the skin above my upper lip. I thought I stunk. 
 
The first food that alerted me to parosmia was a red pepper: why did it smell like gasoline as I was meal-prepping breakfast burritos? Then broccoli, carrots, and more followed. Peanut butter smelled fishy; it now smells and tastes similar to gasoline. Coffee began to smell and taste burnt and like cigars. Luckily, fruits and dairy products have all been fine. Meat started to smell & taste rotten and sour in the spring/ early summer. The only “safe” proteins now are seafood & common vegan meat alternatives in their simplest form, like tofu. The last to go were onions and garlic a few weeks ago: they smell and taste like play dough! If my fiancé eats onions or garlic, hours later I can smell it so strongly, even if he brushes his teeth. It’s a horrible superpower. 

I feel like the gasoline/rotting smell of vegetables has weakened; it’s not as over-powering as it once was. Idk if I’ve just gotten used to it or if my sense of smell has muted again. I kind of accepted those things into my diet and perhaps that’s made my perception change. Garlic and onion is hard to accept into my diet, though.

In addition to parosmia, I have dealt with other long-COVID symptoms like chronic fatigue, brain fog, muscle weakness, & digestive issues. Going out to eat sucks and just makes me super sad. I used to be such a foodie and had such a strong sense of taste and smell. 

**Edit: Forgot to mention the other big thing that alerted me which was weird smells when showering or using other bathroom products. Very musky, chemically smell. I was super confused. Finally I was with my fiancé while he was getting ready for work and I realized it was his cologne. I said, sir, your YSL cologne smells awful, it must be crazy expired, can we throw it away? He fully said, ah, yeah, I thought it was started to smell a bit off, and threw out his expensive cologne. Weeks pass and I end up in Whole Foods waiting for a friend while they used the bathroom lol, during which I perused the bath aisle: the smell hit me like a truck. I realized, Oh, I’m the problem. Once I got home I smelled the different bath products he used in the shower and realized most smelled like that smell. So did some of my hair products. Fresh ginger and, as I discovered at Costco through their soda machine, soda products, smell and taste like it, too??? Yuck. SO strange. 


**Warning - TMI:


My stool has smelled like that original phantom rotting, sour smell I first perceived, since I got COVID. Now, my stools don’t smell like stool but rather rotten/sour versions of the skewed awful smells of things I ate the night before. It smells of sickness.
