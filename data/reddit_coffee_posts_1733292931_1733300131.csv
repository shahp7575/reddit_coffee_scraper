So today I had the chance to meet an external environmental auditor (let’s call her Kat) introduced to me by a colleague (let’s call her M). I’m a rail safety auditor. 

M and I get on well as colleagues and I offered to take her and Kat out to one of our rail terminals for a once off visit/audit, as I’m at my desk she introduces me to Kat. Kat is gorgeous and came across as a very pleasant and sweet person (I could be wrong since we’re dealing with each other in somewhat of a professional capacity). 

The car ride there was filled with some basic conversation between us, which resulted in a few laughs here and there. I show them around and Kat’s enjoying every bit of it, taking photos and asking me lots of questions, I throw in a bit of light banter she responds well. We return and they get lunch, I get my coffee and she smiles and waves me over to thank me for my time. I replied in kind and said hopefully it’s not the last time we meet. 

I see Kat upstairs again looking my way every time I walk past, unfortunately she’s in a meeting, I couldn’t talk to her before leaving for the day and wanted to exchange contacts or ask her for a coffee/lunch. Do I leave it as it is or reach out (I have her email from a previous message) and politely ask her out for a coffee/lunch?

Find the perfect fit for your hiking needs and never worry about water quality again!

So, you’re out in the wild, miles from the nearest tap, and suddenly your water supply looks like a scene from a horror film. Enter the hero: the hiking water filter. Trust me, the last thing you want to do is drink untreated stream water and end up with a stomach bug. I’ve been there, and it’s not pretty.

Let’s chat about why a hiking water filter is your best buddy on the trail. It’s not just a fancy gadget; it’s a life-saver. With bacteria and other creepy crawlies lurking in the most innocent-looking streams, having a trusty Best Hiking Water Filter filter on hand is more crucial than your morning coffee.

# What to Look for in a Hiking Water Filter

1. **Portability & Weight:** You don’t want a filter that weighs as much as your backpack. Look for something lightweight. The Sawyer Squeeze is a fan favorite—tiny but mighty.
2. **Ease of Use:** After a long hike, you don’t want to fiddle with complex gear. Gravity filters are great for their simplicity. Just hang them, and let gravity do the work!
3. **Flow Rate:** Fast flow means less waiting and more hiking. Some filters can pump out up to 1.75 liters per minute. Think about all the extra exploring you can do!

# Top Picks for Hiking Water Filters

* **Sawyer Squeeze:** Ultra-light and filters up to a whopping 378,000 liters. Perfect for long hikes and minimalists.
* **LifeStraw Personal:** Weighing just 2 oz, this is a solid budget pick. Great for quick sips from streams.
* **Katadyn Hiker Pro:** Slightly heavier but super reliable, especially if you’re dealing with murky water.

Got a personal story? Imagine setting up camp by a muddy river and knowing your filter’s got your back. It’s peace of mind you can’t put a price on.

# Keeping Your Filter Happy

Filters need love too. Regular cleaning is key to keeping them in top shape. A simple backflush can do wonders for flow rate and longevity. And remember, a frozen filter is a dead filter. Keep it warm on those chilly nights!

In the end, picking the right filter is all about your hiking style and needs. Whether you’re a weekend warrior or a hardcore adventurer, there’s a Best Hiking Water Filter filter out there for you. Stay safe, stay hydrated, and keep exploring!

Before I start I would like to say I am a pisces sun, cancer rising and leo moon and I need a bit of advice how to deal with sagittarius people and it would be good if you shared your experiences with them.

My father is a sagittarius and we never get along with each other. There are always fights and arguments and he accuses me of being too much sensitive, while he himself is carefree and doesn't care what he is doing with his life. I have met some sagittarius friends as well and I can say there exists good communication between us, if we sit down for a coffee we can have some nice chats with each other but only for that time. With all the sagis i have come in contact with I have the same impression. We can talk and be nice with each other but only on the surface level. There is never deep connection and deep feelings or a long lasting friend that you can find in them. I wanted to have had a long lasting sagi friend because we pisces are empathic and we want to know how we can fix things but regardless of all my efforts it seems we cant get on each others deep feelings.

It is odd though because reading about sagis personalities and observing them, you can say that they live a carefree life and they have fun a lot, however they wont admit it in front of a pisces. I have known that my sagi friends live a carefree life yet they keep it secret in front of me, and yet they wont hesitate to open in front of a scorpio. Maybe sagis and scorpios have a better matching vibe. The only sign i can get along with from the fire signs is the cardinal aries. Leos are fine too and can make good friends as well.

I would like to add that I have trouble with Aquarius too, I never understood how these guys operate. In fact its hard to understand all the air signs as well, but I can say I have found common grounds with Gemini and Libra. But this post is about Sagittarius. So I would appreciate any advice or any common experiences that you guys can relate.

Thanks a lot, pisces rocks.",1,1733298043.0,piscesastrology,2,1.0,False
1h6aryx,https://www.reddit.com/r/mounjarouk/comments/1h6aryx/post_shot_nausea/,Post shot nausea,"Yes, I know I am not special in this side effect :-P But I just took my fifth shot last night and I am definitely feeling the suppression and a bit of nausea this morning. Drinking my normal breakfast smoothie and it's just not sitting fantastically and I woke up with my normal post-shot headache this morning, but all things considered it could be a LOT worse and it just means I need to listen to my body and work with how I am feeling NOW vs. how I felt YESTERDAY or after any other of my shots. 

I know I am a slower starter than some - I have about 45kg to lose, and in 4 weeks I am only down 4.5kg. Then again, that is exactly 10% of what I need to lose in a month, and all things considered, that ain't bad. My dad went on Zepbound a week later than me and has already lost 7kg.... freaking men!! However I am not in a rush, and I really just want to go with how my body feels and make this a really sustainable lifestyle change as I approach food and eating and healthy choices all around.

I ended up getting two 2.5mg pens the first month I bought them, just because I figured I would want to stay on 2.5 longer if side effects were kicking my butt, but since it hasn't been bad at all I talked to my doctor and we are going to do injections every 5 days to basically do an easy titration and then go to the 5mg pens partway through the month. I am really curious to see how that will impact things as I get to the end of the week, and those Day 6 and 7 normal food noise return and higher hunger cues. Also, I was scheduling my shots for Tuesday evening so I was a little less suppressed on the weekends, but that will shift with the 5 day schedule. Interested to see how that plays out both physically and mentally. 

ANYWAY... I guess I just wanted to share because I don't really have anyone I can talk to about it in person as I am keeping this all pretty quiet with folks around me. If anyone has words of wisdom or even just commiseration please feel free to add them in :-) Only 2 weeks and 2 days to Christmas break!!

================================================================

""Discover the SECRET of Fresh breath for Dog https://freepage.pro/samutores/dogfresh""

If you’re a proud dog owner, you know that our furry friends can sometimes have breath that could knock a buzzard off a gut wagon. Whether it’s leftover kibble, a snack from the garbage, or simply a case of poor dental hygiene, bad breath (or halitosis, if you wanna sound fancy) is a common issue among dogs. It’s enough to make you think twice before leaning in for a snuggle. But fear not! Enter dog mints for bad breath—a tasty and effective solution to combat that less-than-pleasant aroma wafting from your pooch's mouth.

In this article, we’ll delve deep into the world of dog mints, exploring how they work, what ingredients are best, the connection between oral health and overall wellness, as well as some tips on how to incorporate them into your dog's routine. So grab a cup of coffee, kick back, and let’s chew through the juicy details!

What Are Dog Mints and How Do They Work?
----------------------------------------

When you hear the word ""mints,"" thoughts of fresh breath for humans might spring to mind. Well, dog mints are basically the canine equivalent! These little tidbits are specifically formulated to freshen your dog’s breath while also promoting healthy teeth and gums. But what exactly is in these delightful morsels, and how do they wield such power over bad breath?

### The Ingredients That Pack a Punch

Not all dog mints are created equal, and it’s essential to know what’s going into your pup's mouth. Here are some typical ingredients found in dog mints that help fight bad breath:

- **Natural Flavors**: Many mints use chicken, beef, or fish flavors, making them oh-so-delicious to your dog.
- **Green Tea Extract**: Known for its antioxidant properties, green tea extract helps to neutralize bad odors and promote oral health.
- **Baking Soda**: This natural ingredient helps to neutralize acids in the mouth, preventing tooth decay.
- **Coconut Oil**: Not just a fad; coconut oil has antibacterial properties that can kill oral bacteria causing bad breath.
- **Parsley**: This herb not only freshens breath but also contains antibacterial properties.

### How Do They Combat Bad Breath?

Dog mints don’t just mask the smell of bad breath; they actively work to eliminate the underlying causes. The unique blend of ingredients targets odor-causing bacteria, prevents tartar buildup, and promotes saliva production to keep your dog’s mouth clean and fresh.

But that’s not all! Many dog mints also help to reduce plaque and tartar, meaning they’re like a two-for-one deal: fresher breath and healthier teeth.

Why Bad Breath Happens: Understanding Halitosis
-----------------------------------------------

Before diving deeper into dog mints for bad breath, it’s essential to understand why your dog might be experiencing halitosis in the first place. You might be wondering, is it just a matter of bad luck or something more serious?

### Common Causes of Bad Breath in Dogs

1. **Poor Oral Hygiene**: Just like us, dogs need regular dental care to maintain fresh breath. Without proper brushing, food particles can linger, leading to bacteria growth.
2. **Dental Diseases**: Gum disease, periodontal disease, and tooth decay can all contribute to less-than-pleasant odors emanating from your furry friend’s mouth.
3. **Diet**: Certain foods, especially those with strong odors, can lead to foul breath. For example, a diet rich in fish or garlic may not sit well with your dog’s breath.
4. **Health Issues**: Sometimes, bad breath could signal underlying medical issues, such as diabetes or kidney disease. If your dog has persistent halitosis, it’s worth taking a trip to the vet.
5. **Foreign Objects**: If your dog has chewed on something they shouldn’t have, bits of trash or toys can become lodged in their teeth, leading to stinkiness.

Recognizing the cause of bad breath is crucial because it can help determine the most effective treatment approach, including whether dog mints for bad breath can do the trick.

The Benefits of Using Dog Mints for Bad Breath
----------------------------------------------

Now that we’ve got the lowdown on what dog mints are and why bad breath happens, let’s look at the benefits of incorporating these tasty alternatives into your dog’s routine.

### 1. Easy to Use

Let’s be honest—getting your dog to sit still for a teeth cleaning session isn’t always an easy feat. Dog mints are a no-fuss way to take care of oral hygiene without the wrestling match. Just pop one in their mouth, and you're golden!

### 2. Promotes Good Dental Health

Regularly using dog mints can help prevent plaque formation, reducing the chances of gum disease, cavities, and some other nasty surprises that come with poor dental hygiene.

### 3. All-Natural Options

Many brands prioritize your pup’s health by using natural ingredients. This means you can feel good about what you’re giving to your furry friend.

### 4. A Special Treat

Who doesn’t love a treat? Dog mints double as a reward for good behavior, making it easier to train your dog and keep them excited about oral care.

### 5. Cost-Effective

Compared to regular trips to the vet for dental cleanings, dog mints are a budget-friendly solution to maintaining your dog’s oral health over time.

Choosing the Right Dog Mints
----------------------------

With so many options out there, how do you choose the right dog mints for your beloved pooch? You don’t want to pick something that smells worse than their breath! Here’s how to sift through the options:

### Look for High-Quality Ingredients

Always check the label for high-quality, natural ingredients. If you can’t pronounce it or if the list looks like a chemistry experiment, it’s probably best to steer clear.

### Consider Your Dog’s Size

Not all dog mints are suitable for every breed. Some are designed for larger dogs, while others are perfect for tiny teacups. Make sure you’re picking mints that are appropriate for your dog’s size to avoid any choking hazards.

### Read Reviews

A little bit of research can go a long way. Customer reviews can provide insight into how effective the mints are and whether other dog owners have seen positive results with their furry friends.

### Consult Your Vet

When in doubt, chat with your vet! They can recommend trusted products and help you establish a dental care routine that works for you and your dog.

Incorporating Dog Mints into Your Dog's Routine
-----------------------------------------------

So you’ve decided to give dog mints for bad breath a shot—great choice! Now, how do you seamlessly integrate them into your pup’s daily routine?

### Establish a Routine

Dogs thrive on routine, so try and give your dog mints at the same time each day. Whether it's after breakfast or as a mid-afternoon snack, consistency is key!

### Use Them as Rewards

Training sessions can be a blast when paired with tasty treats! Use dog mints as rewards for good behavior or successful tricks. Not only will this encourage your dog, but it’ll also help maintain their dental health.

### Monitor Their Intake

While dog mints are usually safe, moderation is crucial. Keep track of how many mints your dog consumes, especially as you introduce them into their diet.

### Pair with Other Dental Care Methods

Dog mints shouldn’t replace other dental care methods but complement them. Consider using dental chews, brushing their teeth regularly, or having professional cleanings done.

Beyond Mints: Other Ways to Tackle Bad Breath
---------------------------------------------

If you find that dog mints alone aren’t doing the trick, don’t throw in the towel just yet! There are several other strategies you might consider.

### Regular Dental Cleanings

Just like humans, dogs need dental cleanings to ensure their oral health remains in tip-top shape. Consult your vet for recommendations on how often your dog should have their teeth professionally cleaned.

### Supplements for Oral Health

Just as we take vitamins to boost our health, there are dental supplements available for dogs. These can help support gum health and freshen breath.

### Home Remedies

If you're looking for natural solutions, some pet owners have success using homemade remedies like baking soda mixed with water for brushing, or offering crunchy fruits and vegetables that can help clean teeth naturally.

### Plenty of Water

Encouraging your dog to drink plenty of water keeps their mouth moist, which can help wash away food particles and bacteria. Make sure fresh water is always accessible.

Conclusion: A Fresh Beginning for Your Dog's Breath

My old main core setup was the Amex Gold + Venture X/BBP which is pretty solid.  The only thing is now that I'm using the AR for everything with apple pay, I don't necessarily need the Gold.  Pretty much every grocery store takes apple pay now (I don't shop at Walmart) and I've had good luck with sit down dining taking apple pay. I also have the Savor One and CSP so I have plenty of 3x on dining options.  

I do use the Gold card's credits easily, I add $7 to my Dunkin app every month and get coffee there from time to time, I already take Uber and there's a 5 guys near my work which I eat at.  My annual fee just posted as well.  

While there's no Amex lounge at my home airport, I do travel a fair amount both domestically and abroad.  I already take Uber regularly so hitting the Uber credits would be easy, so would the airline credit with the United Travel Bank, and my dad wants to subscribe to the New York Times, so that's $640 right there.  While I'm generally more of a budget traveler, I don't think it would be too hard for me to use the Hotel credit too.  

It's also December which means if you get the Platinum card now, you can double dip on the credits which is very tempting.  Only thing is the upgrade offer I have is for $50k MR points.  I would like a higher offer, but I also don't want to outright apply for the card since I'm working on the USBAR's SUB.  There's no way I could hit two.  ",1,1733297731.0,CreditCards,1,1.0,False

1h6aoga,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1h6aoga/my_ex_bestfriend_m33_his_wife_f32_and_their/,☕ My ex bestfriend m33 / his wife f32 and their batshit crazy AM,"If you’ve been following my earlier posts (linked below), you already know the saga of my best friend (K, 33M), his wife, and how I ended up playing unwilling host to their stuff for **11 months**. But this isn’t just about space or clutter. This story has layers—his wife’s insecurity, his lack of boundaries, and my patience wearing thinner than a phone screen protector after a drop.

**Original Post:** [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/s/Adz5jH1OJd)  
**Update 1:** [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/s/bW2abJmgCB)  
**Update 2:** [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1g79quj/update_i_28f_stepped_out_of_my_33m_best_friend/)

K got married earlier this year and left nearly all his belongings—dining table, fridge, bed, microwave, and more—in my house when he moved into his penthouse, **right next to mine**. At first, I didn’t mind. I figured he’d move everything out “soon.” Spoiler: he didn’t.

Starting **November 1st**, I began **practically begging him every single day** to move his stuff out. My parents were relocating after **30 years** and bringing their lives with them, and I had no space because **his belongings were taking up my cupboards and two bedrooms.**

Every time I asked, he had a new excuse:

* “We’re still doing post-wedding rituals.”
* “There’s work being done at our place.”
* “We’re buying furniture and don’t have space for the old stuff yet.”

Important detail: My mom was moving in on 21 Nov

On **November 19th**, I came home from work expecting my house to finally be cleared out. After weeks of begging, I thought this was the day. **Wrong.** Nothing had been touched. When I texted K, he promised to handle it the next morning. Later, he backtracked, texting, **“Actually, can we do it at night?”**

Frustrated, I asked why. After some pushing, the truth came out: **he didn’t have work the next morning—his wife wouldn’t allow him to be in the same room as me alone.**

Later same night, K and his wife showed up at my house. She delivered the most nauseating line ever: **“We like doing everything together.”**

K, visibly uncomfortable with her clinginess, reluctantly backed her up. Meanwhile, I was **barfing in my mouth** at the absurdity of it all.

Trying to keep the peace, K told his wife that the **only space left to clean was the storeroom**—a place where **seven years of our friendship lived.** It held photos from our trips, gifts we’d exchanged, and memories that symbolized our bond. He suggested that just the two of us go through it together.

Her response? In the most patronizing tone, she said, **“What are seven years? You have to spend seventy with me, so do it with me.”**

I was awkwardly smiling. They left, and I told them to **do it whenever they felt like.** But inside, I was seething—angry, frustrated, and feeling completely exploited by two entitled people who clearly had no respect for my time or space.

That night, from **11 PM to 4 AM**, I stayed up cleaning out their junk. I dragged their larger furniture out and stacked it in front of their penthouse. For the rest, I created a **detailed list** of all the remaining items they needed to pick up.

The next morning, the couple woke up, coffee in hand, to the sight of their **mess stacked neatly in front of their house.** And that was only **20% of it.** The remaining **80%** was still inside, waiting to be cleared.

It took them **an hour and a half** the next day to collect the rest, and watching his wife’s **horrified reaction** to the sheer amount of garbage they had left behind was the only satisfying part of this ordeal.

I’d had enough. I slapped K with a **₹10,000/month rent bill for 11 months**, explaining that his clutter had cost me:

* I couldn’t get a flatmate.
* My cupboards were full of things I didn’t use.
* I’d lost time, energy, and my sanity trying to accommodate them.

I told him I’d use the money to **repaint my house** and fix the cupboard hinges that had worn out.

Finally, I blocked **both of them** on my phone—not out of pettiness, but because I needed time to **calm my anger** and regain my peace.

Here’s where it gets even messier. Before the wedding, K’s wife and I got along fine. But after the wedding, she completely flipped. I’ll admit that I wasn’t at my best—I was recovering from a tough breakup, dealing with a falling-apart engagement, my ex’s mom in the ICU, and back-to-back dental surgeries. I didn’t have the energy to be social, so I distanced myself from her.

Months later, when I started to feel better, I reached out, took full accountability for my actions, and apologized sincerely. I thought we could move on. Instead, she became **even angrier**, apparently because I now held the **“moral high ground.”** Sorry for being raised right, I guess.

K tried to mediate, telling her he wanted to spend time with me as friends, but she wouldn’t let him come over without her. Every time he asked for a little breathing room in their relationship, she’d go from crying and apologizing for being controlling to **bat-shit crazy** the moment he asked for relaxed boundaries.

According to him, she’s bipolar and unpredictable. One day, she’d say sorry for being so possessive; the next, she’d accuse him of wanting to cheat with me just because some of her friends had affairs with their best friends.

A week after the “storage war,” K and I had a work trip together. At the airport, after two weeks of silence, he asked why I’d blocked him. I told him I needed boundaries because his behavior was destroying my mental peace.

That’s when he told me everything: his marriage was falling apart. His wife was jealous, controlling, and insecure. He admitted he missed being friends with me and felt trapped. But honestly? It felt like a manipulation tactic—an attempt to guilt me into staying in his life on his terms.

I told him that while I sympathized with his situation, I couldn’t be the scapegoat for their issues. His marriage, his boundaries, his problems—they’re all on him to sort out.

This ordeal taught me a harsh but valuable lesson: not all friendships are worth the emotional toll. I’ve reclaimed my house, my peace, and my boundaries. Watching their stunned faces as they dealt with the chaos they left behind was satisfying, but more importantly, I’m done with their drama.For now, I’m finally breathing easier, and I’m never letting anyone exploit me like this again.

# TL;DR:

My best friend (33M) got married this year and left his belongings—furniture, appliances, and junk—in my house for **11 months**, ignoring my repeated requests to move them out. His wife refused to let him be in the same room as me alone, claiming they “like doing everything together.” When I suggested we clean the storeroom, which held memories from our 7-year friendship, she shut it down with, “What are seven years? You have seventy with me.”

Frustrated, I stayed up from **11 PM to 4 AM** clearing their stuff, dragged furniture outside, and left a detailed list of items. Watching them wake up to their mess the next morning was satisfying, but I was furious. I slapped him with a **₹10,000/month rent bill for 11 months**, blocked both of them, and moved on.

1h6anzs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h6anzs,Proposal plan (hopefully someone can help) ,"Hopefully, someone here can help me…

At the beginning of August, I was in contact with a vendor who was supposed to create a designer toy of my girlfriend. The plan was to place the ring for the proposal inside the toy(in the coffee to be specific). I sent him a sketch of the figure, and he assured me it wouldn’t be a problem. Unfortunately, I was scammed. Three days ago, I received a message saying the figure wouldn’t be completed because it turned out to be much more work than expected. While I understand that, I’m frustrated that he told me only three days before the deadline instead of a month or two earlier. Also the 3d model he sent wasn’t even close to what I’ve sent at this point. The proposal was initially planned for Nikolaus, but I’ve now postponed it to Christmas.

Now, I’m completely desperate and wondering if anyone here might be able to help me on short notice. I realize this is extremely last-minute, so the figure doesn’t need to be made of separate parts—it can be printed as a whole. I’ll handle the painting myself. The only requirements are that the material is resin, that the figure resembles the sketch and that the top part of the coffee can be taken off, so I can place the ring inside it. Of course, I’m willing to pay for it.

I’ll attach the sketch of the figure and the 3d model the guy sent me.

1h6ai12,https://www.reddit.com/r/UARSnew/comments/1h6ai12/fme8_current_progress_and_updates/,FME8 Current Progress and Updates,"Hi everyone! Got my FME installed on 11/17 by Newaz & Jaffari at their Manhattan office. I'll post as many updates as I can here. 

**To start, here's some background:**

27M, caucasian, BMI 23.7. I eat a pretty healthy, mostly plant based diet, moderate level of consistent exercise. Cardio, resistance training, mountainbiking, or pickleball 3-5x/week. 

&nbsp;

Have been pretty tired my whole life, difficulty waking up in elementary/middle school, needed naps after school in highschool. Same thing in college. Had a nose injury that caused a deviated septum when I was ~13.

&nbsp;

In late college (age 21-22), my girlfriend told me that I would sleep talk, breathe weird while I was sleeping, and I continued to be overall pretty tired. Often would wake up with a racing heart and headache. Thought I just happened to be a bit more of a sleepy person. 

&nbsp;

During a family trip when I was 23, my mom noticed that I was choking and breathing weird in my sleep. My girlfriend also noticed that I'd have pretty frequent parasomnias. Got this WatchPAT sleep study done: https://imgur.com/a/2hWAqwc

&nbsp;

During that time my symptoms were:  
Racing heart/headache upon waking up  
Parasomnias  
Anxiety  
Ocd  
Brain fog/mental fatigue/ADHD symptoms  
Irritability  
Anhedonia  
Extreme tiredness  
Urge to nap/go back to bed  
Reflux  
Scalloped tongue  

&nbsp;

Lofta prescribed me a CPAP and I tried it for about 6 months. It made me feel maybe 10% better. During that time I noticed that I couldn't breathe out of my nose well (due to the injury mentioned above). Only 1 nostril at a time, if that.

&nbsp;

Had a septoplasty and turbinate reduction in 9/2022. After the surgery I was able to breathe out of my nose well when standing/sitting upright, but if I laid down I would lose the ability to breathe out of the nostril on the side I was laying down on. This continues to be the case even today.

&nbsp;

Though the septo/turb reduction improved my nasal breathing, I didn't notice much change to my sleep. Maybe a slight slight gain? During 2022 I tried CPAP, APAP, BiPAP, S, T, ASV, ASVAuto with the help of consulations with LeftyLanky and Dr. Barry Krakow. Tried mouth taping, different masks, soft cervical collar, etc.

&nbsp;

I found that ASVAuto helped me the most, but still didn't quite get me to where I wanted to be. In December 2022 I got a dorsal style mandibular advancement device and felt that it slightly slightly helped.

&nbsp;

Eventually in May 2023 I got a true PSG done, should have had this done earlier. Here are the results: https://imgur.com/a/oQJSqE1

&nbsp;

During 2023 I also tried flonase, azelastine, xlear, intake breathing nasal dilator, elevated pillow, occasional Afrin. I felt like I felt slightly better some days after using Afrin the night before. 

&nbsp;

I continue to use Xlear daily and use Afrin ~2x/week

&nbsp;

Current sleep setup is:
ASVAuto, F20 memory foam full facemask, mandibular advancement device, intake nasal dilator, saline or saline with xylitol nasal rinse, occasional Afrin, weighted blanket, magnesium, melatonin, wedge pillow. I still feel terrible most days, but better than without these things. ASV and regular exercise have had the biggest positive impact for me. I also take 5-15mg of Adderall daily as coffee gives me too much anxiety and makes me feel mentally scattered and increases OCD symptoms.

&nbsp;

Did a consult with Kasey Li in early 2024 as well, he said I'm a good candidate for either MMA or EASE. I had started hearing about FME and wanted to wait to hear more as it was much less invasive and much less expensive. Given that my nasal breathing could still be improved, I figured nasal expansion was worth a shot before jumping to MMA.

&nbsp; 

Relevant CBCT: https://imgur.com/a/88fBl5P

&nbsp;

I also have a tongue tie, but don't have trouble putting my tongue on the roof of my mouth. Though I've been told that my tongue is very large for my mouth and I do feel like I could use more space on the roof of my mouth for my tongue. My tongue is scalloped if I don't use my MAD.

&nbsp;


**FME install:**
So, all this led me to doing a consult with Newaz in September 2024. Total cost for FME8 was $15k + $8k for invisalign. Initial consult was $550 I believe. I got a 10% discount for paying in full. Looks like this includes all follow up appointments as well which is great. 

&nbsp;

Initial consult with Newaz was fantastic and I didn't feel rushed at all. All questions were answered. 

&nbsp;

Install was done on 11/17 and total took probably 1.5hr from when I arrived. Super smooth process overall, fantastic experience with the entire staff.

&nbsp;

Install was as easy as can be. The first 2 numbing shots hurt but that's it, Didn't feel a thing during the install. Mild pain for the rest of the day after the install but I was able to walk around NYC and enjoy the rest of my trip.

&nbsp;

**11/19**
I was given 2 turns prior to leaving the office. I felt like I noticed that I could smell better immediately upon leaving. Could have been placebo who knows. I still feel like I can smell better. I also feel like my symptoms feel slightly better. Again, could 100% be placebo. *(Can confirm as of 12/4 it was in fact not placebo.)*

&nbsp;

Now 2 days later my tongue is a little raw, eating is hard, but the actual install site of the device hurts maybe 1/10? Shocked by how easy and painless FME has been.
Have a bit of a lisp but overall talking isn't too hard.

&nbsp;

Now in conclusion to my intro, I'm not expecting major gains from FME but I'll take what I can get. I believe that the issue is my tongue falling back while sleeping. Due to both not enough space for it to sit properly on the roof of my mouth and there being too much resistance in my nose, so my body chooses to mouth breathe. Logically it makes sense that FME may help with this, but we shall see.

&nbsp;

If FME is unable to help with this, MMA might be the way to go. But my approach has been to try the least invasive things possible first.

&nbsp;

**11/20**
Day 3 update, first self turn planned for Friday (11/22).
First thing I noticed right after install was a stronger sense of smell. Again thought this could be placebo but I still notice this to be the case.

&nbsp;

I also have had noticeably less reflux. Now I have been on a lower reflux diet for the past few weeks, but even the couple nights before my FME install I had worse reflux than every day post install. 

&nbsp;

My first day of work after install was yesterday and here's what I noticed:

A bit easier to get up (still difficult)
A bit more energy
Much better cognitive function, my girlfriend even noticed that I was more awake than usual. Usually when I get home from work my brain is fried and I feel dead. I was sleepy, but cognitively much better.

&nbsp;

Second day of work is today and I noticed I had a noticeably easier time getting up. I also feel much less brain fog. Still pretty sleepy, but cognitively I feel better.

&nbsp;

Only changes I've made are of course the FME install and I've started taking creatine about a week ago. But didn't take it for the 4 days I was in NYC. Want to make sure I'm presenting all of the changes that could be contributing though. 

&nbsp;

Definitely open to the possibility that it's placebo or something else, but I 100% feel different post install. No doubt about that.

&nbsp;

Tongue is a bit raw but it's not that bad. Mostly on a liquid diet or very soft foods. Smoothies, protein shakes, bone broth, yogurt, hummus, etc. I can eat regular food fine but it hurts more to swallow and move the food around in my mouth. 

Device area starts to hurt a bit when I'm talking a lot, which unfortunately I have to do for work

**11/21**
FME Day 5 Update

Still feel noticeably different. Much less cognitive fatigue/brain fog at the end of the day. Still pretty sleepy, maybe even more sleepy than before the install but the decrease in brain fog and irritability has resulted in a net positive in the way I feel. 

&nbsp;

Stopped the daily 5g of creatine so I can get a true baseline. But both myself and girlfriend have noticed that I'm much less mentally dead at the end of the work day. Kind of hard to believe only 2 turns could do that, but I'll take it.

&nbsp;

First self turn is planned for tomorrow!

&nbsp;

Also roof of my mouth hurts pretty bad, didn't hurt this morning but I think it hurts because I was talking all day. Hurts about as bad as a few hours after install.

&nbsp;

**11/24**
1 week update:

Did my second turn last night and I continue to feel both sleep and breathing improvements. I was getting some TMJ tightness but I believe this is exacerbated by my mandibular advancement device. That thing has wrecked my jaw. I stopped using it last night and woke up to almost no TMJ tightness as well as a much better feeling bite. 

&nbsp;

It’s crazy that already I can feel noticeably better energy levels, sense of smell, and amount of air coming in. This is after just 4 total turns.

&nbsp;

**11/25**
TMJ tightness has gone away, it was definitely the MAD. Bite is slowly going back to normal. 

I feel some tension in my cheeks but nothing too uncomfortable!

&nbsp;

Got <6h of sleep last night since I stayed up late and forgot I had an early client meeting. I'm sleepy today of course, but cognitively I feel significantly better than I did pre FME. Kind of insane since I've only done 6 turns total since install...
Noticeable tension in my cheeks, but not painful at all. I usually only notice it if I really focus on it.

&nbsp;

I can also see a clear difference in my OSCAR data, check this out: https://imgur.com/a/8zCbx8E

&nbsp;

**11/26**
Turn 7 was today:

Pressure building in cheekbones, feeling a bit of numbness maybe tension along MPS. No issues to note though thankfully!

&nbsp;

Felt pretty tired today, then realized this evening I don't feel great and am getting sick. Nasal breathing still feels great after some Azelastine and Xylitol spray
Also only slept 7h last night and <6h the night before.

&nbsp;

**12/4**
15 total turns! I can clearly see the activation of the device now. No split yet but I'm feeling more tension between my central incisors and the lower part of my nose, not necessarily pain but just tension. Hoping to see a split soon, turning the device has gotten a bit harder.

&nbsp;

I've modified my MAD to no longer move my jaw forward and I split the top half into two pieces since I've had enough expansion to make it tight and uncomfortable to wear. It's basically acting as a TMJ splint at this point. My bite is pretty jacked up from the MAD so I'm not surprised I need it.

&nbsp;

Even with the small amount of device activation, I've continued to see a significant improvement to my sleep. I'm dreaming again which was a bit jarring at first, but is a welcome change. I've had good days and bad days, but overall I am doing better. Even on the days where I don't have the best sleep, I may be sleepy but the brain fog, lack of motivation, irritability, ability to get up and do things, etc. is much much better. It's so much easier for me to get up in the morning, do chores, etc. Hoping that further expansion yields further gains. 

&nbsp;

I've also decreased my EPAP min to 9.4 since I was getting some aerophagia. Perhaps due to my ability to take in more air now.

&nbsp;

My nasal breathing is much much much better, very noticeable. I feel that I can perform better when I work out too? Breathing becomes more and more effortless with every turn of the device.

&nbsp;

I'll do my best to continue posting updates here, feel free to reach out with any questions! I know there's a strong desire for more FME updates in the UARS community, so I want to do my part to share my experience.",2,1733296816.0,UARSnew,2,1.0,False

=================================================================================

When it comes to our furry friends, nothing quite beats the joy of seeing them wag their tails, playfully bounding around with a sparkle in their eye. But let’s face it, as much as we adore our canine companions, dealing with bad dog breath can feel like a punch in the gut! It’s not just a nuisance; it can impact their health and your relationship with your beloved pet. If you’re scratching your head wondering how to tackle this stinky problem, you’ve landed on the right page. This guide will walk you through the best options to combat bad breath in dogs, exploring everything from dental chews to professional cleanings. So, grab a cup of coffee and settle in — you’re about to learn how to transform your pup’s breath into a fresh breeze!

Understanding Dog Bad Breath
----------------------------

### What Causes Bad Breath in Dogs?

Bad breath, or halitosis, is something nearly every pet owner will encounter at some point. But why do our four-legged pals develop such smelly mouths? Well, there’s a whole host of reasons:

1. **Dental Issues**: Just like humans, dogs can suffer from plaque buildup, tartar, and gum disease. Bacteria feast on leftover food particles, leading to foul odors.
2. **Dietary Choices**: Some kibble or treats may not be ideal for oral health. Ingredients that aren’t easily digestible can ferment and lead to a mouth full of stench.
3. **Health Conditions**: Beyond dental hygiene, underlying medical issues like kidney disease or diabetes can also manifest in your dog’s breath.
4. **Poor Oral Hygiene**: If you’re not keeping up with regular brushing or dental check-ups, you might find yourself facing a serious case of doggy halitosis.

So when you notice your pup’s breath could sour milk, it’s time to dig deeper into understanding the root causes, because knowledge is half the battle!

### Signs of Oral Health Problems

Before diving into solutions, it’s essential to recognize the signs indicating your dog’s mouth might need a little more TLC. Look out for these red flags:

- Yellow or brown build-up on teeth
- Swollen gums or bleeding while chewing
- Excessive drooling
- Reluctance to eat or play with toys that require chewing
- A sudden change in appetite

If you notice any of these symptoms, it's probably high time to schedule a vet visit. After all, prevention is better than cure, right?

The Best Solutions for Dogs Bad Breath
--------------------------------------

Now that you’re well-acquainted with the causes and signs of bad breath, let’s roll up our sleeves and dive into what you can do to remedy the situation. From changing diets to incorporating dental routines, there are plenty of actionable steps you can take to ensure your dog's breath isn't a source of embarrassment.

### Regular Dental Care: The Foundation of Fresh Breath

Just like humans, good oral hygiene can make all the difference for dogs. Let’s break down what this entails.

#### Brushing Your Dog’s Teeth

Brushing your dog's teeth may sound daunting, but it’s one of the most effective measures you can take. Think of it like a spa day for their mouth! Here’s how to get started:

1. **Choose the Right Tools**: Invest in a dog-specific toothbrush and toothpaste. Human toothpaste can be toxic to dogs.
2. **Make it Fun**: Use positive reinforcement! Allow your dog to sniff the toothbrush and taste the toothpaste before diving in.
3. **Start Slowly**: Gradually introduce the brush by letting them lick the toothpaste first. Once they’re comfortable, gently brush their teeth.
4. **Establish a Routine**: Aim to brush at least two to three times a week. Consistency is key!

#### Professional Cleanings

Even the best dog owners can’t reach every nook and cranny. This is where your veterinarian comes in! Scheduling an annual dental cleaning can help prevent serious issues down the line. During this procedure, your vet will:

- Assess your dog's dental health
- Remove plaque and tartar
- Provide fluoride treatments

While this may seem like a chore, think of it as an investment in your pet's overall health.

### The Role of Diet in Freshening Breath

What goes in must come out, right? The food your dog eats plays a significant role in their oral health. So, what should you look for in dog food if you want the best for dogs’ bad breath?

#### Quality Kibble

High-quality dry food can help reduce plaque build-up, which means fresher breath! Look for kibble that has a specific texture designed to clean teeth as they chew. Brands that contain minerals to promote dental health can also work wonders.

#### Fresh Foods and Treats

Incorporating fresh fruits and veggies into your dog’s diet can freshen their breath naturally. Consider these options:

- **Carrots**: Crunchy and refreshing, carrots can help scrub away plaque.
- **Apples**: Packed with vitamins and a natural breath freshener, just make sure to remove the seeds!
- **Parsley**: This herb is known for helping eliminate bad odors. Sprinkle a bit on their food or use it in homemade treats.

### Chews and Treats for Fresh Breath

Let’s be honest, who doesn’t love the occasional treat? But when it comes to freshening up your pooch’s breath, not all treats are created equal. Here are some great options to consider:

#### Dental Chews

Dental chews are designed specifically to tackle bad breath while keeping your dog occupied. They’re often textured to help scrape away plaque while your dog chews. Look for options that have:

- **Natural Ingredients**: Avoid artificial flavors and colors.
- **Veterinary Approval**: You can’t go wrong with a product that’s been vetted by professionals!

#### Breath-Freshening Treats

Some treats are formulated with specific ingredients known to combat bad breath. For example:

- **Mint and parsley**: Both are excellent at neutralizing odors.
- **Coconut oil**: Known for its antibacterial properties, it can be a game-changer.

Always make sure to monitor your dog's weight as you provide these treats. Giving too many can lead to weight gain, which brings on a whole different set of health issues!

### Natural Remedies You Can Try at Home

If you're looking to whip up a quick solution at home, several natural remedies can freshen your dog's breath without much hassle.

#### Water Additives

Consider adding a water additive designed for pets to your dog's bowl. These products usually contain ingredients that neutralize odors and promote oral health. Just be sure to follow usage instructions carefully.

#### Baking Soda

Believe it or not, baking soda isn’t just for baking! It can be a natural breath freshener. Just sprinkle a tiny amount on their food occasionally, but consult your vet first to determine the right dosage.

#### Apple Cider Vinegar

Adding a little apple cider vinegar to your dog's water can help kill bacteria and freshen breath. Start with a small amount to see how your dog reacts — and definitely consult with your vet beforehand.

### Keeping Up With Regular Vet Visits

Don’t overlook the importance of regular visits to the vet. They can help identify any underlying health issues contributing to bad breath. By keeping your dog’s overall health in check, you’ll likely keep that bad breath at bay!

### Don’t Forget About Your Dog’s Overall Health

Maintaining an eye on your pup’s general well-being is essential. Bad breath can sometimes be an indicator of larger health concerns lurking beneath the surface. Keeping your dog healthy means keeping an eye on:

- **Diet**: Ensure you are providing balanced nutrition.
- **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can support overall health, including oral health.
- **Weight Management**: Keeping your dog at a healthy weight can prevent a variety of health issues.

Conclusion: Say Goodbye to Doggy Halitosis!
-------------------------------------------

Managing your dog’s bad breath may seem like a daunting task, but it doesn’t have to be. With a little effort and the right tools, you can have your furry friend flashing a fresh-smelling smile in no time! Remember, a solid dental care routine, coupled with a healthy diet and regular vet visits, can go a long way in combating that notorious doggy breath.

So the next time you lean in for a lick from your beloved pup, you won't have to hold your nose or shield your face in horror.

==================================================

Bad breath in dogs is not just an unpleasant surprise when they come to greet you; it can be a sign of underlying health issues. As pet parents, we want our furry companions to be happy and healthy, and that includes their oral hygiene. Have you ever wondered what you could do to combat that notorious doggie breath? Enter dog mouth spray—a quick and easy solution that’s gaining popularity among dog owners everywhere. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the world of dog mouth sprays designed specifically for bad breath, exploring their benefits, how they work, the various types available, and tips for maintaining your pup’s oral health. So, grab a cup of coffee, kick back, and let’s get started!

Understanding Bad Breath in Dogs
--------------------------------

You might think that bad breath is just a nuisance when it comes to your four-legged friend, but it's often more complicated than that. Bad breath, scientifically known as halitosis, can stem from a myriad of causes. Understanding these causes is the first step in tackling the problem effectively.

### The Causes of Bad Breath

1. **Poor Dental Hygiene**: Just like humans, dogs need regular dental care. Food particles left in the mouth can lead to plaque buildup, which ultimately results in bad breath.
2. **Gum Disease**: Periodontal disease is common in dogs, especially as they age. Bacteria in the mouth can lead to serious gum infections that produce foul odors.
3. **Diet**: What goes into your dog's stomach can directly affect their breath. Some dog foods are more likely to cause bad breath than others.
4. **Underlying Health Issues**: Sometimes, bad breath can indicate other health problems like liver disease or diabetes. It's always wise to consult a vet if you're concerned.

By understanding these factors, you'll realize the importance of regular dental care for your pet, and this is where dog mouth sprays can come into play.

The Need for Dog Mouth Spray
----------------------------

So, why should you consider using dog mouth spray for bad breath? Let’s not beat around the bush—keeping your dog’s breath fresh is not just about avoiding awkward moments when they lean in for a cuddle. Fresh breath can enhance your dog’s overall health and well-being.

### Benefits of Dog Mouth Spray

- **Convenience**: Dog mouth sprays are easy to use and can be applied quickly, making them perfect for busy pet parents.
- **Improved Oral Health**: Many sprays contain ingredients that target bacteria, helping to reduce plaque and tartar buildup.
- **Fresh Breath on the Go**: If you’re heading out for a walk or trip, a quick spray can help keep your dog’s breath pleasant.
- **Non-invasive**: Sprays are gentle and don’t require brushing or any complicated procedures.

When you think about it, having a bottle of dog mouth spray on hand is similar to having a travel-sized toothbrush for yourself—it's just a practical way to maintain freshness!

How Dog Mouth Spray Works
-------------------------

Now that we've established the benefits, let's delve into how dog mouth sprays work to combat bad breath. There’s a bit of science behind these little miracle workers.

### Key Ingredients in Dog Mouth Sprays

Most dog mouth sprays contain a blend of ingredients aimed at neutralizing odors and promoting oral health. Here’s a rundown of common components you may find:

- **Chlorhexidine**: Known for its antiseptic properties, it helps in reducing bacteria in the mouth.
- **Green Tea Extract**: This natural ingredient is touted for its antibacterial properties and can also help reduce plaque.
- **Baking Soda**: A classic household item, baking soda can neutralize odors and act as a mild abrasive.
- **Essential Oils**: Certain oils, such as peppermint or eucalyptus, not only provide a pleasant scent but also have antimicrobial effects.

The combination of these ingredients works synergistically to address the root causes of bad breath, promoting better oral hygiene for your pooch.

Choosing the Right Dog Mouth Spray
----------------------------------

With an abundance of options on the market, how do you choose the right dog mouth spray for bad breath? The following tips can help steer you in the right direction.

### Factors to Consider

1. **Ingredients**: Look for sprays that are made with natural, safe ingredients. Avoid products with artificial sweeteners or harmful additives.
2. **Veterinarian Recommendations**: Don’t hesitate to ask your vet for recommendations. They often have insights into reputable brands.
3. **Ease of Use**: Choose a spray that fits seamlessly into your routine. Some sprayers are designed to target specific areas, while others may be one-size-fits-all.
4. **Dog's Preferences**: Believe it or not, some dogs are picky about flavors or scents. You may need to try different sprays to find one your pup tolerates and even enjoys!

Your best bet is to read reviews and even test a small amount before making a full commitment.

How to Use Dog Mouth Spray Effectively
--------------------------------------

Using dog mouth spray is straightforward, but here are a few pointers to ensure you get the best results.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Choose the Right Time**: Make it a part of your daily routine, such as after meals or before bed.
2. **Read the Instructions**: Always follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for dosage and application.
3. **Target the Back of the Mouth**: Aim for the spray towards the back of the mouth, where bacteria tends to accumulate.
4. **Reward Your Pup**: After spraying, give your dog a treat or some affection. This reinforces positive associations with the process.

By integrating mouth spray into your dog care routine, you can make it a hassle-free experience that both you and your dog look forward to.

Other Oral Health Tips for Dogs
-------------------------------

While dog mouth spray can work wonders, it's crucial to complement it with other practices for optimal oral health.

### Essential Practices for Maintaining Your Dog’s Oral Health

- **Regular Teeth Brushing**: Aim to brush your dog's teeth several times a week, if not daily. Use dog-specific toothpaste.
- **Dental Chews**: Incorporate dental chews into their diet. These can help reduce plaque naturally.
- **Routine Vet Check-ups**: Schedule regular veterinary check-ups that include dental exams. Early detection is key!
- **Healthy Diet**: Feed your dog a balanced diet. Some kibble formulations are designed specifically to promote dental health.

By implementing these practices alongside dog mouth spray, you'll be setting your pup up for success in the battle against bad breath.

Natural Alternatives to Dog Mouth Spray
---------------------------------------

If you’re a fan of all things natural and homemade, you might be wondering if there are alternatives to commercial dog mouth sprays.

### DIY Dog Mouth Spray Recipe

Why not whip up a batch of your own? Here’s a simple recipe to get you started:

- **Ingredients**:
- 1 cup of water
- 1 tablespoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon of peppermint or cinnamon essential oil (ensure it's safe for dogs)

**Instructions**:

1. Mix the water and baking soda until dissolved.
2. Add the essential oil and stir well.

Store in a spray bottle and use as needed. This homemade option can be a cost-effective way to maintain your dog's oral hygiene while keeping the ingredients natural and safe.

Common Misconceptions About Dog Mouth Sprays
--------------------------------------------

It's crucial to distinguish fact from fiction when it comes to dog mouth sprays for bad breath. Let's clear the air on a few common misconceptions.

### Debunking Myths

- **Myth 1**: Mouth sprays can replace dental care.   
    **Fact**: While helpful, sprays should complement regular brushing and dental check-ups.
- **Myth 2**: All dog mouth sprays are safe.   
    **Fact**: Always read labels and consult your vet. Not all products are created equal.
- **Myth 3**: An occasional spray is sufficient.   
    **Fact**: Consistency is key! Regular use yields the best results over time.

By debunking these myths, you can make informed decisions about your dog's oral care routine.

The Emotional Connection Between Bad Breath and Pet Owners
----------------------------------------------------------

Let’s talk feelings. The bond we share with our pets is unlike any other, and that includes the joy (or distress) they bring into our lives. Bad breath can sometimes feel like a barrier to that intimacy.

Imagine cuddling your pup only to be hit with a wall of stinky breath. It’s akin to being smacked in the face with a fish market! You may feel embarrassed when guests come over, or it might even affect your affection towards your furry friend, albeit unintentionally.

By investing in solutions like dog mouth spray, you’re not just addressing a physical issue; you’re enhancing the connection you share with your pet. Fresh breath and a healthy mouth pave the way for a closer, more enjoyable relationship.

The Role of Diet in Managing Dog Breath
---------------------------------------

Earlier, we mentioned how diet plays a role in your dog’s breath, but let’s dig deeper into that topic. The food you choose has significant implications for both breath and overall health.

### Key Dietary Considerations

1. **Quality of Food**: High-quality dog food tends to be more digestible and less likely to cause bad breath.
2. **Hydration**: Ensure your dog has access to plenty of fresh water to help wash away food particles and bacteria.
3. **Raw Foods**: Some advocates suggest that raw diets may contribute to fresher breath, although it's essential to consult with a vet before making drastic changes.

Diet is a huge factor—so it’s worth examining what you’re putting into your pup’s bowl.

Conclusion: The Fresh Breath Journey
------------------------------------

In the grand scheme of pet care, combating bad breath may seem like a small victory. However, it's about much more than a pleasant sniff before kisses! Using dog mouth spray can significantly enhance your dog’s quality of life, improve their oral health, and deepen the bond",1,1733296292.0,FreshBreathChampion,0,1.0,False

1h6a8nw,https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1h6a8nw/coffee_table_why_life_is_a_horror_movie/,Coffee Table - why life is a horror movie,"This post contains spoilers. 

One of the things I find the most frightening about life is how easy it is to fuck it up in a way you can't go back from. Not only can one bad decision lead you into a nightmare, it can be just one bad moment, where you don't even make any big conscious choice. One small accident. The line between your normal, comfortable, safe and familiar life and a horror movie can be an event that happens in a second or two, and then the former is closed to you forever. 

There's a sense of extreme injustice about this, but who can you complain to? 

This movie captures this feeling perfectly. I read some comments that this is a horror movie parents would feel the most, but I think everyone can understand it, as least I did. This situation can be something else, but the point of it is, its the moment after which life of the subject is destroyed. 

While I don't really get how the accident happened (it sounded like he was showing the table to the baby and dropped it on it, or he put it under the table? confusing, but although the guy didn't want the kid, it definitely doesn't seem plausible that he killed it), it happened in a bizarre and unlucky moment.

It's insane, you can do risky things in your life, you can recover from crazy accidents and situations, but one bad mundane moment can destroy everything. 

I could very visceraly feel the reaction after, the sense of such total shock where you can't even process what happened and want to just make it go away. I could totally understand why he went on with the dinner and then planned to just kill himself, how do you face the outcome of that? And the sense of panic and sickness creeping through that whole evening. I think a part of you believes it can't be real and you'll wake up or it will magically get fixed because it's too insane, too unfair and just too big to deal with. 


Even as a viewer, I kept irrationally expecting some magical fix, that it was just a weird nightmare or that the kid will come to life by some supernatural forces and redirect the movie, because I got into the characters head and simple reality seemed to be too much, almost unreal.


What's the right reaction? I guess to call the cops right away and whatever, but really there's no right reaction, there's nothing you can do to fix the extent of the damage that affects not only your life but others too. It's too much to face. 



The ending also made perfect sense, because again, what else can you do when you can't live with it?

Ultimately the movie for me was about the danger, randomness and unfairness of life, where there's nothing you can't lose. 


Aside from that, I liked how realistic the movie felt, at first I found his wife really grating, and in many scenes she's intolerable but I appreciated how they didn't play into an idylic family. It didn't take away from what happened to them, it made it more effective. The acting and tension are excellent. I throught the guy's reactions throughout the movie were believable and it really immersed me in that metnal state. 



I didn't know much about this movie aside from that the title got my attention so when I saw it brought up a few times I finally decided to check it out. I was under the impression it was some bizarre movie about a haunted coffee table, and really didn't expect what I got, especially how quickly the tragedy happens and the rest of the movie is the agony of the aftermath.",6,1733295697.0,horror,1,0.88,False
1h6a7ma,https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/1h6a7ma/coffee_spamming_during_the_raid_didnt_turn_out_so/,Coffee spamming during the raid didn't turn out so well,"I had never done any coffee (or similar) spamming  before since it stresses me out when resources dwindle quickly. But I thought I would come prepared to the raids yesterday and not let my teammates down, so I came with 77 coffees and thought I would down 10 in some crucial moment. Well, during the first turret fight my two teammates died early on, I pushed on a bit but didn't quite have the DPS so I thought I would abandon it. I would have guessed I had pressed my shortcut button for the coffee maybe 30 times during the fight. But lo and behold, toward the end I noticed that my AP did not stay up even though I pressed the button. All the coffee was gone. There's no way in hell I pressed the button 77 times ...

How does one keep the usage in check? How many coffees are normal to consume during one fight? If I'm gonna have to save up for several days of playing (don't have time to play several hours per day) for just one fight, then I will just have to go back to the way things were before with no spamming whatsoever.

By contrast my stimpak reserve never dwindled although I had all the available auto stim stuff and must have been taking damage constantly. 

What's funny is when I later faced the snake boss with a team, with no coffee to my name, my AP bar was often pushing upward (better than when I spammed) even though I didn't consume any AP buffs. Is there anything teammates can do that make your AP go up like that?",2,1733295597.0,fo76,0,1.0,False

A Duke from England goes to an undisclosed country “over the pond”, perhaps Canada.  Sadly his luggage doesn’t arrive so he goes to a men’s clothing store where a single lady of the appropriate age is the owner. He places an order, she delivers the order, he is rude, she is miffed, he apologizes, she accepts, they drink coffee. And she agrees to be a paid escort.  Of course love will bloom.

I thought this would be a romcom but it just turned out to be a rom, without the com. It was extremely bad and I cannot think of a single good thing about it other than it was less than 90 minutes. Just horrible. I will give it 0 stars out of 4 stars and request that all humans actively avoid this film for nothing good will come from watching it.

Once we got into jobs, we connected again through social media and got talking. We belong from the same city and we had just recently moved back to our hometown after working in other cities. I had gotten out of a 4 year long relationship (and broken off the engagement as well) a couple of months prior to connecting with her but she was still with her ex at that time (and I had no idea about that). I liked her as I found her insanely beautiful and also very calm as a person (from our interactions around common friends). We met a few weeks after reconnecting, her best friend also came along (who was also in our college). Later she met me alone as well and I told her about my breakup story but she didn't mention about her relationship. We just had a coffee and conversation, no hanky panky. But I developed strong feelings as I genuinely liked her as a person. Fastforward few months and I proposed to her, she said yes (not very enthusiastic though). Then she told me that she had broken up with her ex recently (who was also her coworker in previous company) but what was weird is that she told me that they never actually had a mention of breaking up but rather slowly stopped talking to each other. Also, he was a few or six years older to her and he was married. She said she was fooled by him on pretext of having a sad and poor relationship with his wife and was close to divorcing her (but he never did). That itself sounded astounding to me to believe but on top of it, she said she was a virgin and had never had sex (but had done everything else apart from penetrative sex). I had very openly told her everything about my sex life. So we started dating and seeing our history, we decided to take it slow before telling anything about our relationship to our families so we don't make any more mistakes again in our life. She told her dad within a month once we started dating. We both had just turned 30 so she started to get pressured from her parents to get married. Once that happened, our plan to take it slow went for a toss and we literally engaged within the second month of our relationship. We got married in the sixth month of our relationship which was too soon for me and I did mention it to her as well. Soon we will be completing 3 years of our marriage. I have observed a two things that concern me often:

1. When we started dating, sex (non-penetrative) was quite often and very intense including BJs etc. I always reciprocated the BJs . We did have penetrative sex after getting marriage with all sorts of positions (some which she guided me for which made me doubt if she was really a virgin, not that I care about virginity but it is more about lying and lying is a very big deal for herself ironically). Now, the sex average is twice a month mostly plain vanilla, no BJs. It makes me want to watch nudity online to satisfy my craving while I still feel attracted to her but nothing much happens.

2. Her intense uncontrolled mood swings during periods (something I have noticed only after marriage). She says all sorts of things during periods some which she knows very well are hurtful towards me, almost as if to test my patience and incite me to do something bad like breaking stuff. In fact, I have broken things twice (and apologized for that later) and had never done that before in my life. She will say things like ""I am stuck in this marriage"", ""Do you want to hit me"" etc. Although I have thankfully been raised well enough to never even imagine hitting a women or a child. Those days are very hard for me. A good life gets changed into the worst life very easily.

I got married at 20. Prior to getting married I working as a paralegal (loved, loved LOVED my job…and I was good at it). I had dreams of moving to California because you can take the bar exam there without going to law school. I used to love studying just for fun. I loved philosophy and theology. I had hobbies. I used to refurbish old furniture and resell it. I loved debating. And snowboard. I was excited about life. Then I got married and moved onto a military base because my husband was military. Finding a job in a small military town was impossible so I was unemployed. I’ve been unemployed for 4 years now. Then after a year of marriage and trying for a baby I got pregnant. Baby #1 came along and I did have some PPR and PPD but it wore away when she was around 6 months old and I began thriving. When she was 8 months old we decided to try for another baby. I had 2 back to back losses, but the 3rd time was a charm. Baby #2 is 5 months old now and I adore her. I absolutely adore both of my kids. Loving them is so insanely easy. I didn’t know I can love someone so immensely until my first baby was born. I didn’t think I could love another baby as much as I loved her, but then the second came along and I was wrong. They mean everything to me. But it’s been hitting me hard lately, the redundancy of each day. Sometimes I feel hopeless. Change poopy diapers, redirect a rowdy toddler every 2 seconds, breastfeed, pump, make a meal, clean up after meal, then it’s almost snack time, clean up whatever my toddler got into for the millionth time, etc etc. husband is incredibly busy with work which is great because his new business is really picking up. But husband comes home late and he expects coffee and dinner to be ready for him after a long day of work. I put the kids down to sleep feeling a weight off my shoulders until the next day…but then I have him to take care of. And then there’s the expectation of sex after cooking up dinner at 8pm and then cleaning the kitchen and additional tasks that I couldn’t get around to during the day. I don’t even know who I am anymore. I’m dull. I swear my IQ dropped since having kids. I used to be intelligent. I used to be witty. I used to take care of myself. I used to wear nice clothes. I used to be pretty. I used to carry myself with so much elegance. Now I’m just a wreck. I went from 100 to 0. All I do is take care of others and I lost myself in it and I’m honestly miserable. I spoke to my primary care doctor about possible depression and he referred me to BH to see if there’s something they can do to help. BH prescribed me a 30 minute walk a day 🙄
I’m not eligible to even be seen by a psychiatrist. Has anyone with small kids been through this? Please tell me the sun shines again and that it won’t be like this forever. And any advice on how to get through this? There are little joys in life, like how my baby looks at me with so much love while breastfeeding, and when my toddler randomly comes up to me and gives me a hug and kiss…but I’m finding it hard to maintain that joy.

I find visits from my in laws so overwhelming; my FIL doesn’t use google translate although he knows how to (he used for his first trip to us), he just finds it annoying. Which means, he just talks at me in his language and hopes I magically understand (I don’t!). 

This is made all the more difficult when I’m with my toddler or in a public situation. If my husband isn’t available to translate, we cannot understand each other unless I use google translate. I don’t have the freedom and time to type out what I want to say, while managing my toddler. I have to yell for my husband to come back. 

I can see my husband gets exhausted by it too, by being used as the translator. He asks his parents to use it but they don’t. He just says his dad is too stubborn. 

It means that I find FILs visits very overwhelming, he’s a very helpful and kind man, but not being able to speak to each other about very important things is difficult.

My husband wants my FIL to stay, in our 1 bed flat while we have two children (baby and toddler). If I have to get up with baby at 4am, I’d bring him to the lounge to settle him and put him in his Moses basket and try to sleep a little more myself (in the lounge). 

If FIL was staying here, he’d start talking to me in his language while I have the baby; after I’ve just woken up at 4am. Before I could even drink a cup of coffee, I’d be having to get google translate out, ignore my baby to do this etc. I wouldn’t be able to sleep in the lounge with my baby and FIL. 

My husband is upset that he ‘won’t get to see his parents’ because I said it’s too much if FIL comes while we have such a small space, and I need the lounge to settle baby. I suggested that a hotel, given the circumstances, would be very reasonable and of course we will pay (we wouldn’t want or let FIL pay). In his culture, family don’t stay in hotels when they visit… so in my husband’s mind, he can’t see his father…

got my meds (30 mg) yesterday and am wondering when to start. Prescription is 30 mg to start with. 

I have borderline (diagnosed by my last therapist), general anxiety disorder, C-PTSD (both diagnosed by a psychiatrist some time ago) and ADHD (diagnosed with 14 with EEG, psychological tests and interviews with my parents and school). 

My ADHD symptoms trigger the other conditions pretty well, so I hope to get some relief from it, my therapist think it might be a good relief. 

I read, especially with anxiety, that Vyvanse could trigger that in the beginning pretty bad when it fades out. Also, I had Withdrawal symptoms because I didn't drink coffee (severe headaches), and read to really don't do coffee, normally I'm on 6 cups a day. 

I have the next three pretty important work meeting, but also right now, I'm stressing out about everything pretty fair and also struggle with tasks. On the weekend, I'm helping a friend with moving, also not the best time to start, to have an emotional rollercoaster. 

Should I start today? When did you start? Should I wait for a better week for it? Otherwise, Christmas is around the corner and I don't want to mess up my vacation. ",2,1733294300.0,VyvanseADHD,4,1.0,False

1h69oxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h69oxx/my_paranormal_experience/,My paranormal experience ,"So I’ve been told from a couple people I should put this online somewhere just to see what others think and a podcast I listen to, Redweb, has mentioned here a number of times about people posting theirs so I figured why not. So here is my paranormal experience.

This happened back in Highschool/middleschool so around 2010-2012 I’m not positive on what grade but it doesn’t really matter. A little back story that I learned many years later is that when my dad died in the early 2000’s, lead poisoning as we joke about but really self inflicted gunshot, there was a friend of the family that practiced warlock/whichcraft stuff and did a “protective chant” over our household. Could be related could not I feel it’s relative enough to add to the story. 
  So we lived in a 4 bed 2 bath double wide mobile home just my mom, the oldest boy, my sister and me the youngest best boy. Which from the front door you could go straight through the back half of the living room, turn left in the dining room, straight in the kitchen to a back hallway with the washer/drier, turn left in the master bath, straight into the master bed, once in the master bed turn left and be back in the living room to repeat endless. A lovely little circle to run in as kids. When in the dinner room if you turned right would be a hallway and the first left would be a bathroom, second left was my room straight was my brothers and right was my sisters. I could draw a picture of the house if anyone cared for it.
  At night my mom would close her door going to the living room but normally leave the one from her bedroom to the master bath and from the bath to the hallway open. We had a fridge in the back hallway the we kept waters in and sleepy mom didn’t want to deal with doors.  
  Well as kids normally do I was staying up late, probably on our family desktop in the dinner room or maybe playing Xbox who knows and doesn’t matter. It’s late midnight to early ams for sure and I decided to get a water from the back hallway. Well my mom is a creature of habit if anything. She has her spontaneous moments but her morning and bedtime routines have always been the same. Shower, read, bathroom, turn off her lights, face down her blue led lighted alarm clock and go to sleep, wake up, fold up alarm clock, brush teeth, coffee read in bed, get ready for day. Every day the same I’ve never seen it change. Until today.
  Once I got to the door for the master bath in the hallway I probably had 3 or 4 steps to the back door and fridge to the right of that but something caught my eye. Something I knew was off. Wrong in this routine. Her led alarm was facing up. Here room had that faint glow of blue led that just pieced to my eyes in the hallway, not a ton of light but enough to see shapes and the such. So I thought it odd and went to investigate. My mom being a very light sleeper normally would hear someone just walk into her room so I tiptoed into the bathroom, between the tub and vanity to the master bed door and stood in the doorway. Just curiously investigating. When I saw it. 

A figure. At the right side of my mom’s queen size bed. Her side she slept on, with the light glow of the clock. I could see it standing there. But not right. Its legs were straight. It’s hips slightly taller than my mom laid on the bed. And the “thing” a perfect 90 degrees directly over my mom. I went to speak but stop. I might have made a noise I don’t know. All my hair was standing up. Then “it” stood up. In a snap it was straight vertical. Like it took a floating back step pasted in front of the clock blocking out the light and into the shadow of the wall on the right. I was too scared to look hoping I imagined it. Oh. How I was wrong. It what seemed like a long time but by the clock no time for I never took my eyes off those blue leds they went dark. 
 He was in front of me.. At the time I was a runner. 6 feet 4 inches tall and about 165 pounds. Not a thick man but a tall one at the least. And. And this thing. Was every bit looking me eye to eye. It was light a shadow. But you shouldn’t see through it but at the same time you could. I was cold. I was scared. This thing filled the door way in front of me literally nose to nose with me. And I did the only thing I could. The only logical thing my terrified mind could think of in the situation of me, my mother and some entity. 
 
In my mind I wished my mother the best of luck. I turned on my heels. I ditched the water idea, gave up on what ever game or device I might have stayed up way to late on and I went to my room, closed the door and hide under the covers because everyone knows monsters can’t get you there and went to sleep. 

Over the years I have been asked by my mom about this incident and it’s always been the same retelling. The fear and cold of just her bedroom and bathroom, the figure watching her and coming to me. This all being caused by her upturned led alarm clock, which was never again left upturned I might add. I never saw “it” again, I never wanted to see it again. I’ve done some digging over the years and came up with nothing on the subject. He did not have a hat, no glowing eyes. No facial features or any features for that matter. It was like a shadow of my exact size that once in front of me filled the whole doorway but didn’t. Like a person of darkness but clear. The best I can describe was when looking right at a spot it was just darkness but around that spot in your peripheral vision you could see what was behind him. I have not a clue what it could have been. If this was just a random thing. Maybe something from my dad. He was the same height as me and my weight at that age, not when he died. Was it something today with the warlock/whichcraft.
  I have honestly no idea. I’m 28 now. Every so often this thought comes back to me and I can still feel that same fear. My morbid curiosity would love to figure out more about what this could have been but alas I’ve came up short. Maybe someone out there has some knowledge of what I speak. Or maybe a similar experience. Either way, thanks for reading.",2,1733293484.0,nosleep,1,0.67,False

I know it could be something else.

That being said, since I can remember I’ve always been very bed ridden, in the sense that I cannot get myself to leave the bed to do anything at all whatsoever. I want to be productive and have all the motivation in the world to accomplish all my goals, or take care of my responsibilities, but it feels like no matter how “hard” I try I can’t get myself to do anything but doom scroll or play a video game until my brain feels like it’s going to explode. I’ve been through so many hobbies, routine attempts, goals, and jobs, but I always end up dropping the ball every single time, even though I wanted to become more involved in it. I’ve been stuck in the same year of college for so long, I stay motivated for a week and then end up right back where I was. It really depresses me, which in turn amplifies my inability to do anything. My entire life is about to fall apart around me and I still can’t get myself to get up and do something about it, even though I know I’m capable of it. It feels like I’m stuck in my body and even though “I” want to do something really bad, my other half makes the final decision, which is to do absolutely nothing all day every single day.

Example:

I wanted to learn Japanese because it’s extremely difficult and I like the challenge. I was so excited to start. I’d wake up in the morning, make breakfast and coffee, and study for a little while and I’d feel accomplished. Each day I started doing less and less until yesterday I completely stopped and gave up.

I checked our system and managed to find his previous purchase and we only charged his coffee so I printed it and showed him his reciept. After seeing that he kept asking where his $10 had gone and started calling us thieves and that all we ever do is steal from everyone.

After explaining a few times I referred him to call customer service if anything had gone wrong and that they would be able to help him more than we could as we provided proof of what we charged. He then started telling us that our families and children would pay for stealing and being thieves.

1h69lvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifecoaching4u/comments/1h69lvp/how_to_make_your_girlfriend_happy/,How to Make Your Girlfriend Happy?,"Hey there, Reddit! If you’re here, you probably want to know what makes your girlfriend happy. Whether you’re in a new relationship or you’ve been together for years, there’s always room to bring more joy and smiles to her life.

Relationships are a beautiful journey where both people get the chance to uplift and support each other. Making your girlfriend happy isn't about grand gestures or expensive gifts it’s often the little things that mean the most. So, let’s explore some simple yet powerful ways to light up her world!

# Listen to Her Heart 🫶

One of the best ways to make your girlfriend feel loved and valued is by really listening to her. Listening shows her that you genuinely care about her thoughts, feelings, and experiences.

When she’s telling you about her day or sharing something that’s bothering her, give her your full attention. Put down your phone, make eye contact, and show her you’re truly present in the moment.

Listening is also about empathising with her emotions. You don’t always need to fix things; sometimes, she just wants to be heard and understood. Whether she’s sharing her dreams, fears, or frustrations, let her know that you’re there to support her without judgment.

# Surprise Her with Small Acts of Love 🌸

Big gestures are lovely, but small, consistent acts of love and appreciation will make a lasting impact. You could surprise her with a handwritten note, make her favourite meal, or bring her coffee in bed.

Think of the little things she loves and incorporate them into her daily routine. These small gestures go a long way in making her feel cherished and special.

You don’t have to break the bank, either! A simple *“Good morning, beautiful”* text or a warm hug when she least expects it can bring a huge smile to her face.

Maybe plan a surprise picnic, give her a shoulder rub after a long day, or tell her one reason you love her every day. These moments create a strong foundation of love and happiness in your relationship.

# Show Her You Appreciate Her 🥰

Everyone wants to feel appreciated, and showing your girlfriend that you notice all the amazing things she does will make her heart sing.

Tell her how much you appreciate her kindness, how proud you are of her achievements, and how grateful you are for her presence in your life. You might be surprised at the difference a simple *“thank you”* or *“I love the way you...”* can make.

Let’s take a moment to thank YOU for being here and taking the time to read this. By actively seeking ways to make your girlfriend happy, you’re showing that you’re invested in your relationship and that’s something to be proud of.

Relationships grow when both people are willing to put in the effort, so kudos to you for wanting to make a positive difference! 🌈

If you’re ever feeling uncertain or need extra guidance, don’t hesitate to reach out to a professional. Therapy or counselling can be a wonderful step for those looking to grow and strengthen their relationships even more.

# Embrace Quality Time Together 🕰️

Life can be busy, and sometimes, we get caught up in our routines. However, setting aside dedicated quality time to spend together can do wonders for your relationship.

Whether it’s a cosy night in with Netflix, a spontaneous road trip, or a walk in the park, spending meaningful time together helps you reconnect and bond.

During these moments, put away distractions and focus solely on each other. Ask her about her dreams, share stories, laugh, and just enjoy being together. Building memories and experiences will create a stronger emotional connection between you two and make her feel truly happy and appreciated.

# Support Her Ambitions and Passions 🌱

Your girlfriend has dreams, passions, and goals that are important to her – and she’ll be over the moon if you show genuine interest in supporting them!

Encourage her to pursue her ambitions, whether it’s a career goal, a creative hobby, or a personal project. Attend her events, ask her about her progress, and celebrate her achievements with her.

Being her biggest cheerleader not only brings her happiness but also strengthens the trust and love in your relationship. When she knows that you’re by her side, supporting her every step of the way, it boosts her confidence and shows her that she can rely on you.

# Conclusion: Love Is in the Little Things 💖

At the end of the day, making your girlfriend happy doesn’t require a grand plan or an endless budget. It’s about paying attention to what makes her smile, being thoughtful, and showing her that she means the world to you.

The small acts of love, genuine appreciation, and moments of togetherness create a happy and fulfilling relationship that brings joy to both of you.

Remember, relationships are about growth and understanding. Continue to learn about her and the things that bring her happiness, and don't be afraid to be vulnerable with her too. By nurturing your relationship and staying tuned in to her needs, you’ll be well on your way to building a loving and joyful life together. 😊

So, go on – make her smile today! You’ve got this! 🌟",1,1733293149.0,lifecoaching4u,0,1.0,False

I switched my midday kombucha for a Recess drink today and I was pleasantly surprised to see the effect. Maybe it was a placebo effect but maybe not. I do CBD in my morning coffee and then had the Recess around midday. A slight headache I had went away, I felt relaxed but clear and was able to tackle some work things.
