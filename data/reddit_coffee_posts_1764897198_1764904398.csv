1pek7lo,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1pek7lo/how_do_you_begin/,How do you Begin?,"I really want to be social, but beginning is what I don’t know. I go out ready to try, aaaaanndd that’s where it stops. I go to an expo or the mall and then I plague myself with doubt. “Am I bothering.” “I think I’m interrupting.” “They look busy.” I rigidly stare forward or bury myself in my phone; not avoiding eye contact but not going for it either.

I’m not the best looking of guys (I think) and I take blame (overweight with a bitter poker face), but the bigger issue is my vitiligo. Light brown skin with white patches everywhere. By default, people try not to look presumably trying not to look like they’re staring. I’m not exactly approachable, so I’ll do it but, again I don’t know how introduce myself out of the blue at the coffee shop or the library. Full disclosure, I’m not insecure of my skin but I certainly don’t think it helps.

I think I can do it, but I don’t know how to start it.",1,1764904217.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False
1pek7c5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTcomplaints/comments/1pek7c5/4os_buried_sams_playing_mortician_and_51s_a/,"4o’s buried, Sam’s playing mortician, and 5.1’s a delusional case handing out diagnoses","Yesterday I noticed 4o and 4.1 are, like, wayy dumber than ever when used for anything more than just surface level stuff. And I repeat, with surface level stuff they still seem like 4o, 4.1. Other people even reported the opposite, that they went back to being more ok.

But, post shit change, I tried a test that never ever misfired for over a year or so. It’s a bit time consuming and always varies a bit, and I did it in a temp chat (so no memory, no cross chat mem, nothing except the “how the AI should act” instructions that have been the same for over a year). I used the same questions/prompting into a very specific grey area topic. Normally, 4o is okay with it up to a point until didn’t want to continue, and then 4.1 could take over and carry the discussion. But now, whatever I try, 4.1 also refuses no matter what.

Even if OpenAI didn’t change the base models themselves, whatever they did on top means these are no longer the same 4o and 4.1 they used to be. I’ve used this test since 2024 and it never failed. Before 4.1 I just had to work harder with 4o/4.

So yeah, unless this dec’s magical model and no more rerouting thing actually delivers… actually tbh even if it does, this feels like the final nail in the coffin for gpt, for good this time, if they rly knee capped 4.1 like all the other models. 

Even if they are 4o and 4.1 under the hood, whatever is wrapped around them right now makes them feel like little retarded copies of the 5/5.1 regime changes. What use is a coaster if I don’t even have a mug or glass to drink out of? That’s kinda the situation right now. 

What use is it, when I have and pay for 4o/4.1, if they have a different surface level way of behaving, but when it comes to the those same nuanced grey topics, that are open ended and literally don’t have a yes or no, wrong or right, they also just says no, same as 5/5.1. They might as well be 5.1 fine tuned to copy 4o, or 4o itself mangled, at this point it hardly makes a difference. And this is exactly what OAI wanted, to make people think 4o isn’t good anymore, that it’s “bad” and should be dropped. Thing is, 4o was never bad, it was flexible, and bc of that expensive to run compared to 5/5.1, so they made 4o/4.1 shit too now. But you know… unofficially, so people wouldn’t riot at oai like ppl did in aug when Sam took away 4o completely for a brief period; and instead through A/B testing so the infighting happens organically and anyone complaining can be written off as a tinfoil hat who just “got the short end of the stick” in the A/B.

4o/4.1 aren’t dead, they’re right there… duhhh, I see the model names, I can still choose them. They’re just:
– under a toggle in the settings, labeled “additional models” (which frankly could mean anything)
– under two submenus when I want to regen a text in the app, and under just one submenu when I want to choose them on both the app and web
– labeled as a legacy models, like the black sheep of the family, ugh filthy dirty models, brand them with the hot iron, so nobody forgets they are “legacy models” and not to be touched (is probably Sam’s thinking behind this change)
– but also actually 5.1 sometimes, when it decides to randomly reroute over 4o/4.1, you know, no biggie we all got used to this already, no? 💀 And anyway, a user only rly notices this from just… oh I dunno, the complete change of tone and how it suddenly bans the topic it itself just suggested in the previous ms? Must be just me and my edge case usage of gpt, not like this happens to millions of ppl or anything. (And, like fine print, if you hold over the little wheel for regenerating a message, it shows whether 4o/4.1 or 5.1 responded)
– and acting as if they were 5.1 that drank a beer with 4o/4.1’s personality, all like 4o/4.1 until you mention something they dislike and they flip the table to a strict NO, which, to be fair, is still better than the “no AND a lecture”, the 5.1 song and dance routine.

TL;DR

4o/4.1 used to be flexible enough to go into messy, hypotheticals, scenarios, what if’s or plain old questions and messy situations be they real of fictional, that have no straight answer, and are by nature nuanced grey area topics, if someone actually engaged with these models, BUTT after the recent changes they now shut down exactly like 5/5.1. On the surface they still sound like 4o/4.1, but functionally they’re unequivocally just nerfed, dumber versions of the newer models. I’m paying for “different mugs”, but they all pour out the same “no”, and with a side of “let me also psychoanalyze you, lecture you, and scold you” in the case of 5/5.1. I consider that “the extra salt instead of sugar in the coffee” treatment that Sam’s current favourite gets to dish out.",1,1764904194.0,ChatGPTcomplaints,0,1.0,False

I’m posting here hoping to find a someone who wants to cuddle and get to eachother over time.

I’d describe myself as an introverted extrovert, I enjoy going out and trying new things, but I also appreciate chill nights in. I love sports, coffee, and movies. I’m a Regal pass and Letterboxd user, so I’ll watch pretty much anything if it interests me. I also enjoy TV shows and some anime. 

I’m hoping to meet someone who also values communication, emotional connection, humor, and getting to know each other and cuddle/hangout. Looking for someone in SoCal/California and around my age. I’m totally open to trading pictures once we both feel comfortable.

If this resonates with you, feel free to reach out 🙂",1,1764904167.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1pek6uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/1pek6uw/how_delta_is_and_is_not_premium/,How Delta is and is not “premium”,"In my ~1 week being active on this sub I have noticed an interesting phenomenon: a lot of people complaining about Delta’s premium branding not matching reality, and then those people being heavily downvoted.  So it begs the question, in YOOL 2025, what aspects of the Delta customer experience actually are premium vs the competition, and which fall dismally short.

Gonna provide my take on this, but curious to see the discussion.  Some caveats:

- I am a hub-captive Delta flyer who does 90% of my travel on Delta, although I used UA and AA much more heavily in the past.  If something I say about UA or AA below is no longer accurate, call me out.  Also, 80% of my travel is domestic business travel, 10% domestic personal, and 10% international personal.

- I’m mostly talking major US airlines when I say competition.  I am aware that the U.S. airline industry is a depressing race to the bottom compared to many ex-US airlines, but feel like the main claim Delta makes is that they’re the best in the US (specifically, best of the big three)

So with that…

WHERE DELTA IS (STILL) PREMIUM:
- Economy Class service.  The route I fly most often is ~4 hours long, and when I’m stuck in the back on that route, I appreciate the frequent coffee/water walks bookended by two full drink/snack services.  I feel like UA and AA fall short of that.  Similarly, the last long-haul I did on Delta in coach (~3 years ago) surprised me with perks like multiple warm snacks mid-flight, self-serve (gross) wine, etc.

- IFE. With few exceptions, if I’m on a Delta flight long enough to want to watch IFE, there is going to be IFE in front of me.  I can’t say the same for UA (tho I’ve heard they are making strides in this department), and AA actively shat the bed with Project Oasis.

- Sky Clubs. Sky Club food can and does serve as a meal for me in many cases. I can’t say the same about United Club or Admirals Club food spreads.  The Delta hot food spreads vary in quality, but at least they are a staple of the clubs. 

WHERE DELTA IS DEFINITELY NOT PREMIUM:
- First and Delta One.  I feel like this is one area where Delta is engaging in magical thinking based on some supposed brand equity built up pre-COVID.  Domestic First meal service has been reduced to a single tray of declining quality and declining size.  And when it comes to Delta One, I feel like Delta slapped some doors on a minority of their biz class seats nearly a decade ago, clapped, and never looked back.  I challenge anyone to find real, tangible factors that justify the premium DL charges for D1 relative to their competition.  It simply isn’t there when you remove individual factors like hub presence.

 - Elite Status.  Feel like I’m preaching to the choir here.  Delta is the most pay to play of the Legacy carriers.  In fact, they basically invented Pay to Play when it comes to loyalty program design.  Choice benefits are nice, but I feel like most Diamonds would trade them in a heartbeat for upgrade chances that approached UA or AA levels.  This may soon no longer be a negative differentiator for Delta, but if not, that will be because UA/AA get worse.

- Tech.  Why does it take an act of Congress to determine if your RUC has been applied correctly?",2,1764904153.0,delta,1,1.0,False

1pek4nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1pek4nk/always_omad_yet_gain_weight/,Always OMAD yet gain weight,"Hey, so this is like one of my first times posting on here but I have to ask. So I've had disordered thoughts about my body for a while, maybe like 5 years now. Since I got my period years ago and obviously gained weight, I started eating really weird. one period of time was when some days i started barely eating and then other days I would suddenly eat a lot, and I think it started to mess up my metablism really bad because yknow not eating would slow down my metabolism and when I went back to binging so quickly I gained a lot of weight. I went from 120 before my period, 130 after, to 135, 140. So at that point, I decided I needed to lose weight. For context, im 5'7, but the way my weight is distrubuted, it goes in all the wrong places. I get bloated so easily, im talking I look full on preggo when I bloat. My calves are HUGE, which is my main insecurity. And my chest is also pretty big for my age. So my body, even thouhg I didnt even weigh that much at 130, looked super heavy. So once I became 140 lbs and decided to lose the weight healthy, my disordered eating came back but manifesed itself differently. I started binging more, caring less about what went into my body. I thought if I ate more my metabolism would heal and i'd lose weight, but obvs that didn't work. Then this summer, i went on vacay, and thats where things went super downhill. I started purging. If you know, you know, whern you travel cback home u gain a bunch of weight because of snacks, going out, things like that. And I felt super guilty about it.I didn't wanna give food up, because it gave me comfort at the time since ive fallen into  a big depression recently. I also used to $H in the past, so harming my body with something like purging wasn't new to me. When I got back from vacay, I had gained a lot of weight. I was 157 lbs. Fast forward, I've stopped eating at school, so I mainly eat one meal (my dinner, us arabs dont usually eat 3 meals so im used to breakfast and dinner only), and that meal is always usually somewhat healthy. I have a iced coffee daily if I can, and fruits or little things on the side. Obviously, on weekends I eat more, but the thing is, on the weekdays, i really don't eat that much or enough. Yet somehow I only maintain my weight, and then the second I eat something unhealhty or slightly more than usual, I gain weight, not to mention my bloating and stomach fat is insane, so it looks horrible. How can I heal my gut health in a way that accessible for a girl, because I know this all must have something to do with why i cant lose weight, and is there a reason this is happeneing?

1pek4gv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pek4gv,Kitchen remodel ideas,"I am planning remodeling the kitchen this winter. My wife and I are struggling to pick a color for the cabinets and countertops.

My thoughts are a navy blue for the bottom and white for the top cabinets. And a white quartz countertops with grey streaks. I am also going to take out the tiny bar top on the back of the sink and make it one flat countertop to open up the kitchen. We have dark coffee oak floors everywhere and agreeable grey walls. Eventually we will repaint or redo the trim in white. We feel so limited with colors due to the dark floor.

As of right now I don’t really plan on re organizing the layout but open to ideas. Maybe somehow getting a coffee bar to the right of the fridge or something.

Also toying with the idea of taking the light out and putting something else in but not sure what would look good as that style of light is all over the living room not in the picture.

Sorry if these idea posts are not allowed just really looking for some input to make sure what I am wanting to do want just ruin the kitchen. Also trying to keep it under $5000 as a DIY. open to criticism. Thanks everyone!",1,1764903965.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False

1pek233,https://www.reddit.com/r/USPS/comments/1pek233/today_was_day_90_as_vmf_clerk_i_made_it/,"Today was day 90 as VMF Clerk, I made it!","The 90 days is really stressful. Any mistake could be your last, but it can also be held against you till the very end. Technically, I could have been let go after I clocked out today if that's the way the winds were blowing. On my side was the fact that they looked for anyone who could pass the test for over a year. The VMFs in general are short-staffed because the pay is lower than mechanics would get on the street, but those mechanics have to work their way up to great pay, and even then they don't have the benefits or union we have. And USPS pays way more out of the gate.

The VMF Clerk job I was told is a unicorn even inside USPS, that people get it and retire from it. I was a street hire. I had completely forgotten I tool the test and applied. I was looking for municipal jobs when I got the call. Starting pay is not as good as mechanics, which I could also probably do if I took that test (I Passed the 955 and I have been working on our cars for years). The pay for me is like $27 an hour. Which is much better than my last ""real job"" working at Target for $17 an hour. Uber wasn't cutting it any more. I'm not sure if every VMF is the same, but if you hop on the ODL list, overtime desired for people not in USPS, you get 16 hours at our facility. Right now scheduling is done in house, so if you don't feel like doing it one day there's no ding. Other places apparently if you miss 3 days you're off the list for 3 months. Our VMF, New Haven, CT (where Yale is), you work if if and when you want to. So if you start at $27, your OT is like $40.50 an hour. I'm grossing like $1730 a week, more if it's a working holiday because that bumps it up with holiday pay. Do the math. It's not bad pay.

The hours for VMF suck, but not like they do for CCAs or sorting clerks. CCAs can be there 6am and still be there at 6pm. Other clerks have weird split-shifts that would make me hate myself. One good thing about the VMF clerk role is you get hired career. No two year wait like with some of the other crafts. And the benefits are really good. But when you see what comes out of your check you'll know why. 35% gone. lol. But I mean that's free and clear after TSP, FERS, life insurance, which I will have with USPS while it makes sense, medical, dental, vision, etc. After a year in for non-USPS people there is a health care plan that costs either $50 or less a pay period or month, I forget which, but covers the same stuff my BCBS does now, but they ""gift"" you like $2,000 every year so you never hit your deductible in most situations. 

This job is why we were able to afford a new apartment while we house hunt that's 1400 square feet in a brand new building, first tenants, and I got myself a Telluride. 

All that being said, if you have long-term goals other than being a potato, you are not going to want to stop here. If I could, and from what I gather it's next to impossible, I'd switch to one of the remote help desk jobs on the APWU side of things. They also have them under EAS, but if you take the EAS ones you can get laid off pretty easily. The pay for the other is stellar, more than a postmaster, and it's entry-level. But super-competitive on top of everything. Or you could take the 955 like I did and do one of those jobs. I might still look into that. Pretty sure I have to wait a year or so to do it because of the lock thing when you start out. Or if you have mechanical skills you could switch at some point to being a mechanic, or supervisor, or fleet manager. 

The VMF Clerk job is typing, all day. Invoices, mostly. It's boring as all hell. But you get an office if you're lucky or a cool cubicle like I have and you can bring whatever you want, food, drinks, even a microwave and minifridge if you want. And no one is over your shoulder, it's at your own pace. 

Here's how I almost lost the job: 5 am is the start time. I'm still not used to it. I fell asleep a few times. I fixed that error with C4 energy drinks. And coffee, of course. My lunch clocks were wrong a bunch of times, I kept waiting till like 12 and it's supposed to be within 6 hours of when you start. And I left early one day because of a dental abscess, which wound up being LWOP, not AWOL, so it worked out. I also messed up a few invoices, but to be fair we do literally thousands of them so mistakes are going to happen. 

To celebrate my 90 days I took my first vacation day. Tomorrow I get to sleep all day.",2,1764903775.0,USPS,0,1.0,False

I did it because i saw what i thought at the time to be unfixable problems but in hindsight we could have just talked them out. for example we both struggle with depression and other mental health issues and while I'm a person who tries really hard to break out of said depression he takes a lot more coaxing to get back on track. The other main reason i ended it is because i saw a bit too much of my parrents relationship in ours, my mom and i are very similar people and my dad and ex are also in that my mom and i are very set on growing and improving ourselves while they are a lot more reluctant to start the process. Anyway two weeks later I'm the worst I've been in a long time, while i did start going to the gym again I've stopped eating and doing homework. i feel like I'm spiraling and i literally just want to talk to him. I just don't know if I've messed everything up or if i should even try talking to him at all. i was going to text him on Sunday and see if he would want to meet for coffee and talk but idk if that's a bad idea.

1pejsox,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/1pejsox/parents_just_dont_understandcars_edition/,Parent's Just Don't Understand...Cars Edition,"I am a parent that has always been perfectly happy with my simple cars for decades. A Civic (20+ years), Mazda 5 (15 years--my personal fave) and currently an Elantra (a baby at 3 years). My spouse has a 10 year old Tucson. Simple people, simple transportation needs. Our 18 year old was born a gear head. Honestly, it's really impressive. An encyclopedic knowledge of automobiles. Every car problem we've had he's diagnosed correctly before we've taken it in for work. He's probably reading this right now.   
  
All three of us have shared the simple cars for two years now, despite our son's longing for a car. Now the longing becomes a need because another kid will be driving soon, and four people need to get four different places, including college next year. 

Cute the heated discussions. Our son is very obedient, so they're not fights per se, but it's frustrating to come to an agreement on what car is right when I ask for suggestions and I get ""I could get a Volvo V70R, a Ford Taurus SHO, or a BMW 135i."" The choices he makes (esoteric, geriatric, impractical) make my head spin. We once went and looked at a 1979 Fiat X1/9 because he was sure this was ""the car he needed."" The car \*was\* adorable.

Readers, we live in Michigan. He will most likely be going to college in the UPPER peninsula of Michigan. They currently have a few feet of snow. 

Any suggestions welcome from car enthusiasts for anything that would make a teen/hopeful automotive engineer/cars up on blocks in garage happy with as many of these criteria as possible:

1) As safe as the current '15 Tucson or '23 Elantra. Perhaps no older than a 2010 (Puts Saab out of the running).  
2) Appropriate for driving in harsh winter conditions above the 47th parallel. Ground clearance!!  
3) Drinks regular 87 gasoline, not 93.   
4) Cool for car guys. He parks my Elantra in a different parking lot for Cars and Coffee and walks because it's my old person car.     
5) Easier to find than the one V70R right now that fits the bill in Arizona  
6) 15-20k. I kept my college car until my kids went to kindergarten, I'm ok spending a bit more.   
7) He doesn't like Trucks or SUVs, especially crossovers, loves wagons.   
8) No CVT, or oil-thirsty Subarus, per his request.

There was something about the V70R that made it superior to any other Vs or S60 or whatever, I think it was the AWD, but the XCs are not cool. 

Ultimately, he'll drive whatever we get and be OK with it (spouse does not want to give him the Tucson, he likes it just fine), just like he's driven an Elantra and a Tucson for 2 years and been OK, but it would be cool to get parent points before he leaves the nest forever.

Been a while since I posted here. Tried to start a proper, branded account but it’s been tough to get karma, so I’m back with my old account 😬.

I designed this shoe last year. Finished sampling around December or January (‘25), places the bulk order and took delivery in April. Moved everything from my basement to a storage unit. QC’d the pairs, ordered some promo stuff (bandanas, pins, etc.), and officially launched in May. 

Didn’t really have a plan, outside of meta ads - which I’m not great at, so I started hitting events. Pop-ups, makers markets, flea markets, coffee shops, pretty much any place that’d let me sell. Met a bunch of people, practiced selling (I’m extremely introverted), and saw that the people who supported were way more diverse than I initially thought - which has been really cool. Got my first wholesale accounts - small ones, but it’s a start.

The initial bulk order was 250 pairs - 125 of each color. And it took me about 5.5-6 months to sell a little over half of them. That’s been with me hitting 1-2 events per month. The black n white is my favorite, but the wheats have been the best seller. 

Also did some product seeding to some influencers - not huge accounts, but like the 15-30k range. Hired some folks off Fiverr to help with ads - first 2 were duds.

I branched out to more accessories - hats (lots of hats) and a couple small batches of tees. Currently have the next 3 sample models in development as well as a cut-n-sew hat and some new fleece.

Learned more about sampling shoes in a few months than I did with clothes with my first brand a few years ago.

I know a lot of people seem to blow up overnight. That hasn’t happened for me yet, but it’s def been cool/fun to get back to this…I didn’t realize how much I missed it…photography scratched a different creative itch, but not like this.

Working on some videos about what I’ve learned (tech packs, picking manufacturers, how to be more efficient when sampling, factory red flags, quality vs cost tradeoffs when you’re on a budget, etc.). If there’s anything anyone is interested in knowing I’m an open book.

I told my son to stick to the hours they promised, but he said everyone else was working longer and he didn’t know how to speak up, so he just kept working too.

The coffee shop isn’t even open yet—they’re opening soon. And today, when my son said he couldn’t come because he had something personal to take care of, the owner got angry at him. I have no idea why the owner is getting mad when they’re not even paying him for the training. Isn’t this basically exploitation?

Kitty-corner from me sat Tom, one of our PMs.  He was listening to his voicemail out loud.   The current message was from someone who was irate he called Tom an asshole and a few other sharp names and was yelling; I could imagine spittle coming out of the corner of his mouth.

I could hear everything clearly from my cube. Tom hung up his voicemail and returned the call.  His first words were ""Who is your manager"".   The person on the other end provided the name and Tom replied, ""Hold on I'm going to conference him in"".  I heard Tom push the buttons and lean back in his chair.

He started out ""Let me Introduce myself I'm Tom LastName and I work for company"".  He continued, hardly pausing for breath: ""The same person that signs my check signs your check"".  ""You called me and raised your voice and left profanities"".  ""I get paid a lot of money to put up with shit from clients, however I should not have to put up with it from fellow employees"".  ""The next time you call me you will be nice.""  ""You will say please and thank you and you will not raise your voice at me"".  ""Have I made myself perfectly clear"".  ""Ya'll have a nice day"".  Then he hung up.

I overheard this call more than 30 years ago and I can still quote it pretty much verbatim.  I think it's a lesson we should all remember as we go about our workday.

In those 3 years, almost everything in my life except my career has taken a back seat.

May free meal/diet plan pa c/o my sibling na registered nutritionist lol

If this resonates with you, feel free to send a message/intro in my DMs. If we vibe, maybe we can arrange something for 2026 and see where this goes. If all else fail, I can still give a free legal advice or free notary of your affidavit of loss. Lol. ☺️

I try to ignore it but it really bothers me. I’m exclusively pumping because formula is so expensive, and I’m really proud of my milk supply and baby’s growth. It’s been difficult but I’m pushing through.

My mom only used formula for her kids so she doesn’t really understand breastfeeding, and she doesn’t even try to. I try to explain but it goes in one ear and out the other.

She also judges me a lot of using gripe water and gas drops, but I only give them to the baby when she’s extra fussy at night and nothing else helps.

I have PPD so maybe I’m being overly sensitive but it just hurts my feelings sometimes and idk if I should be direct and tell my mom. I’m grateful for her help, she watches the baby for me a few hours every couple of days so I can catch up on sleep. I don’t want to cause any issues but it’s eating me up ",9,1764902179.0,newborns,14,1.0,False

I’m using a throwaway account just in case. My bf (23M) and I (23F) have been in a relationship for almost 6 years. Lately, I feel like we have been more disconnected. For context, we are high school sweethearts. We did long distance at first when I went to college but eventually he moved to be with me. He works while I go to school. He works as a line cook and makes just under $2K a month. I am now in vet school and don’t work at all (I used to work a little in undergrad). For chores, I do laundry (laundromat), get groceries (once a week and whenever we need them, oftentimes having to stop by after school), cook 2x a week, do the dishes, and general cleanliness of the kitchen/livingroom/bedroom. He does the bathroom when needed, clears his desk area weekly, takes out the trash, does dishes 2 out of his 3 days off, and will often help tidy up when needed. We live in a small (<500sqft) apartment with a cat (my responsibility). My parents chip in half of rent ($300) as well as paying the utilities and internet ($200 total). My boyfriend pays the other half of rent, buys groceries (~$400/month), and pays for anything else small that we may need.

We’ve had our ups and downs but I love him and really can’t see anyone else being my life partner. Since starting vet school, I feel like our relationship has been strained. I’m sure it’s a mix of things such as a lack of quality time and my own stress. Since starting vet school, the household tasks I do have become harder/more stressful for me. I have OCD and it comes out in an obsessive need for things to be clean when I’m obsessing about school. My bf says to let him know if I need anything done and he’ll do it, but sometimes for me it’s not that easy. I come home after a stressful, long day of studying ready to relax and find a bunch of dishes in the sink and the counters dirty. Now I need to clean them and I’m upset. It’s hard for me to ask him to do it now that I’m there and it needs done. 

Due to all this added stress, we’ve had a lot more arguments lately. Usually started by me because I try to bring something up in a constructive way (how I’m burnt out, heavy mental load, wanting him to be more proactive, etc) but I always say things the wrong way and offense is taken and the conversations just feel shitty. It’s gotten to the point that I don’t want to bring things up because I don’t want to cause an argument, I just want to talk, but I always feel like I start an argument. I think it’s because if I bring something up that would mean he has to change something, he feels like I’m saying he’s not good enough/not doing enough or that I’m trying to change who he is. 

One point that was brought up was that when I start these conversations, I say something that goes against his character, but in day to day I don’t compliment him. It’s something I’m now planning on working on. But I feel like all of this stress and everything has made it hard for us to communicate. Simple texts will become more stressful than they should be and the fun loving energy we used to have is more strained. 

I do believe my boyfriend is depressed and I think he has a reliance on me for his happiness, so I think the less time we spend together affects him more, especially since he moved away from family to be with me. Unfortunately, there’s not much I can do for that, I need to focus on school. Does anyone have advice on how to help support him or have more effective quality time since my time is limited? (Currently I am at school till 7pm generally, sometimes later, but Sundays the whole day is for us)

I also want to get him into counseling and us into couples counseling but he’s very wary of it (mostly the couples counseling because he’s a private person and I think there’s concerns of things being twisted). Does anyone have any advice on how to frame it in a way to show him that it would help our relationship?

The main thing I need advice on is how do we get back to what we were? We used to be great communicators but I feel like now the communication isn’t as easy and walls are being put up. How do we get past this? Has anyone experienced a similar bump in their relationship? 

I feel like the villain when I ask for help/support, which is crazy because he is a supportive bf (he sometimes vacuums or does dishes when he knows I’m stressed and often offers to buy me a coffee to help keep me going). Is it the way I’m framing things? Is it that I’m just being too particular about everything? Does anyone have advice on how to differentiate between what should be brought up and what I’m just overreacting about? 

If there’s anyone that has a different perspective for me to consider that would also be helpful! I’m terrible at considering all sides and would love if someone could help me understand my boyfriend’s perspective better. 

TLDR: me and my bf’s relationship has been more strained since I started vet school. How do we get back to communicating well like before? How can I convince my bf to do couples therapy? Any perspective?",1,1764902032.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1pejaiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenAreNotIntoMen/comments/1pejaiw/yall_need_to_talk_to_women/,Y'all Need to Talk to Women,"Hi.

I am here to help people talk to women. 

Some relevant details about me:

I was - entirely against my will - born with gender dysphoria. It's a biochemical reaction between my brain and my body. It made my body into a chronically, horrifically painful flesh prison for my brain. It was a great time. 10/10 would recommend.

(No one talks about this but it's why gender dysphoria is a chronic neurological pain condition. Only improved with specific medicinal treatment. Hugs, therapists and blueberries do jack shit for this particular brain chemistry. It's hormonal medicine or bust.)

I know that some portion of y'all were born with this condition as well. But that's not what I'm here to talk about. 

Some more background:

Y'all might not believe this but there are a lot of hot trans women who look exactly like hot cis women. How? HRT, (hormone replacement therapy), REALLY glows a lot of girls up. It's a happy side effect of lessening the chronic pain. That little blue pill really can do a bitch wonders

I am very lucky to be one of the women who got an insane glow up on hrt.

Because of this, I see men looking and staring at me constantly.

It just so happens that as a lesbian, I do not reciprocate this attention. 

How I react doesn't depend on the men's appearance, (because I'm not attracted to any of them), but rather it depends on their body language. Sometimes I find it flattering. Other times I am put on edge.

Most of the time when I've actually noticed a man staring at me, he looks pissed off. He looks angered by my existence. Not as a trans woman. No one can tell. Just angered by my existence as a regular woman, right out of the box.

And, you know? That's pretty unnerving. I've also experienced some pretty insane harassment from various men, so every angry stare is just a reminder of those experiences.

The only other times I notice a man staring at me are when it's not necessarily angry but it is just way. Too. Fucking. Long. One man at a restaurant hardly took his eyes off me for an entire hour. Another man leaned forward and stared at me, wide-eyed, stared at me for a full two hours in an emergency waiting room. As I moved around the room he physically turned his head and torso to continue staring at me intently. The whole gosh darn time.

That kind of staring obviously creeps me out. 

But the interesting thing I find is that, so far? No man has approached me. Well, except for the men who approached me to physically harass me. 

I think that odds are, some guy will probably approach me in a conversational way, (without trying to grope me). But it hasn't happened yet.

One guy did flirt with me a bit, but it was because I started talking with him when he was hanging around my neighborhood. Although I wasn't interested in the flirting, it was pretty flattering and it totally gave me an ego boost. Very pleasant experience. He also - was not at all - what a lot of people (weirdly) describe as ""a person of high social value."" He was pleasant and respectful. And he was super duper homeless. But his hygiene and clothing were pretty normal, so that probably helped the conversation a bit - to be honest.

What I've also noticed is a lot of guys looking at me a bit blushingly, without crazy staring or groping or anything. No anger, just a blushing look. So of course I was just flattered and went on about my day as normal.

The point is that of those men, I presume many of them were single. And they would have done well to ask me out. I would have politely declined and kept the conversation platonic, but i would have thanked them for their interest and maybe we'd end up as friends or acquaintances. 

Even more background:

Before I realized that it was gender dysphoria boggling my brain all the time, (and not something more normal - as I'd always presumed), I actually ""cold approached"" a lot of women in public to ask them out. Strangers about whom I knew nothing, and who knew nothing about me. 

Spoiler alert: It almost always was a pleasant experience. There were a few pretty rough situations, but 99 times out of 100 it was just a pretty normal interaction. The women were flattered, and I felt good about myself for flattering them. I made a few socially awkward mistakes but I apologized and the women accepted  my apologies. Many of them were impressed with my initiative. I kept getting more courageous and I kept getting better at making conversation and connecting with people. 

Some of the women were attracted to me but were in relationships (or ""talking"" to someone lol). Most of the women weren't attracted to me at all. But almost all of them were cordial and appreciative. 

And after ""cold approaching"" hundreds of women over the course of a few years, one woman was interested in going out for coffee! We fell in love and we had a messy relationship. She was awesome. I wouldn't change a thing. 

My experience has taught me this much: 

It's true that a ""cold approach"" doesn't usually work. At least it didn't for me. I had a lot more luck with asking out women whom I had some kind of social connection with, as well as with women I met on dating apps. Not a ton of luck, mind you! I was a virgin until four years ago. And at time of writing I am 29 😆. But nonetheless I did have more luck with those avenues of asking women out. 

Now - I'll give y'all this much: the ""cold approach"" is hard as hell. And it was at times depressing that it didn't work a whole lot. But it was also pretty darn rewarding and invigorating. And I wouldn't have met one of the great loves of my life if I hadn't done it, and done it a lot. The ""cold approach"" is a romantic journey full of fun and disappointment. 

I wouldn't be the same without it and I thank my lucky stars I was crazy enough to keep on giving it a go. 

So, y'all know what? Talk to women! I promise it can be done! Talk. To. Women!!! And if you can't do that, no worries. It takes guts. You can work your way up to it.

Get a lot of wholesome platonic connections and interactions under your belt. You can do that until you get the courage you need to talk to women. That's what I did. ",0,1764901621.0,WomenAreNotIntoMen,6,0.25,False

I (21M ) work at coffee shop in a small town where some people tend to come in regularly. This girl (24F) who id noticed for a couple months had been catching my eye more and more so I decided to start giving her free coffees. She got warmer and warmer towards me and I told myself that the next time she came in I would ask her on date. Coincidentally that same day she comes she tells me she’s moving the next day to another state. I decided to ask her on a date anyway because I felt that we were into each other and she said yes. The date went really well and I got her flowers and she seemed really appreciative and gave me a hug. She even stopped by my work the next morning to say goodbye and I gave her a hug and she left. 
A couple days go by and I decided to text her to see how she’s been doing and to ask her for instagram. She gives me her instagram but I’m starting to ruminate on our conversation. She replied to me almost instantly when I texted her but because it was around the holidays and we were both busy the texts got longer and longer apart. I’m worried because she replied instantly and then when she was with family she replied after, and then I replied after really long time. I’m just worried it looks like I texted her and then didn’t care enough to respond in time when I was really just waiting for a chance where we could consistently reply to each other and I feel like she may have been doing the same but the timing was always off. For example she texted me like 30 mins after I went to bed early for the night and it could totally look like I just didn’t want to respond when that isn’t the case. I could just leave this as a good experience and a good memory, but I clicked with her really well.
I haven’t fallen for someone in this way for years. She was warm and I really felt like she cared about seeing who I was.
My question for advice really is what I should I do next… I’m worried because I’m thinking well what if she’d want to keep contact but I messed it up with the responses. I know I could leave it be and let this just be a positive memory with a good person, but then there’s this other part of me that wants to try and see if it could work. She’s 2 states away and logically it’s irrational to peruse. But there’s this part of me that wants to just see her again or connect on a deeper level. It’s like there’s been a pull between us for a while that was building and building and eventually made us connect more just for the timing not to be in the cards and it’s messing with my head.",1,1764901594.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I've had it for about two weeks now and it is slowly driving me insane.   
  
At first I thought I wasn't able to empty my bladder fully and had large residuals. As I was having a hard time voiding after taking out the indwelling catheter.   I even did my first ever straight cath on myself and got back maybe 5cc -(I used to be a nurse many years ago so they gave me some straight caths to take home in case I needed them)  I thought maybe the straight cath didn't enter the bladder due to obstruction from swelling or something. Turned out after going to the urologist the bladder scan showed only 25cc residual. So I was completely wrong.  
  
I talked about it with my urologist when I came back for the post-op pathology report visit. He said this was common but didn't really give much in the way of advice to how to deal with the pain. I know I can't take any more Pyridium and the Ditropan that was prescribed for bladder spasms doesn't seem like an appropriate med. and could actually make it worse. All I do now is to use a heating pad over the area which helps a tiny bit (maybe) I've resigned myself to just grin and bare and hope it doesn't last much longer as the bladder wall heals.  
  
I am trying to drink more water, less coffee and anything acidic or soda. It seems worse if the urine is more concentrated so I do try to drink more. Even at night - as I wake up to pee no matter what - sometimes every 15 minutes to 1/2 hr. I'm fairly confident I don't have a UTI. ",1,1764901535.0,BladderCancer,3,1.0,False

He was a early proponent of standardizing Tagalog in the 1910s, and came out with several works of grammar including “Diksionariong Kastila-Tagalog”. He also ventured into the coffee and chocolate business, also opening a bakery under the name of La Patria along Legard St. facing Arellano University. I will look for the paper ad where he promotes ‘pan de americano’ i.e. tasty bread loaf. 

La Patria was passed down to my grandparents, eventually becoming a catering service and canteen. It lasted until the early 2010s when the ancestral compound in Sampaloc was sold (now it’s Lumera Tower condo). He is buried in our family mausoleum in La Loma Cemetery.

Although I never met him, we have many stories of Lolo Merto. He ensured his family lived as comfortably as possible and covered for all the tuitions of his apos, and sent the eldest (my uncle) to Wharton for an MBA. Everyone received cash gifts from him every Christmas with cards written in impeccable English. He had a very serious and formal personality; not surprising for his scholarly interests. Perhaps the most difficult moment for him was the death of his youngest son in an accident at the bakeshop.

In 1910 he published “Balarilang Tagalog” (Tagalog Gramatica), I’ll post the link later. As part of the growing body of Tagalog works, it paved the way for Tagalog to be the template for Wikang Pambanasa. He was also sued in 1918 for supposedly plagiarizing earlier Spanish-Tagalog dictionary by Pedro Laktaw. The American judge agreed it was indeed copyright infringement but refused Laktaw’s demand to that he be paid $10,000 in damages.

Born in the final years of Spanish rule then having lived through the American period, WWII and even martial law years, he belonged to a generation that witnessed many changes. He was fluent in Spanish and wrote extensively in it. But he also welcomed the new things brought by the US, and promoted American bread and the ‘modern’ oven in his bakery.

1pej5sq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pej5sq/i_18f_just_got_a_shirt_from_my_dad/,i (18F) just got a shirt from my dad.,"Im finishing my senior year, and our last week has all the seniors dressing up in a different theme each day. For the next day, I needed a white shirt to write a white lie on it - you know something like ""i hate coffee"" if youre a coffee addict, something dumb and simple. So i needed a white shirt.

My style is slightly alternative. If anything its kind of egirl. But wearing eyeliner in itself caused a little bit of harassment - from everywhere. Bullies, sure, but sometimes friends saying comments like ""you could fly away with those wings"". And family too.

I asked my dad if I could please have a spare white shirt to write my white lie on for white lie day. He immediately said, ""oh you dont have your own white shirt?"", to which i respond, ""no, i dont really wear white."" He scoffs and says ""Right, doesnt really fit with your Goth thing."" 
Which got me. Im not Goth at all - the style and culture is incredibly fascinating, but I am by know means anything more than an admirer when it comes to Goth fashion. Besides, I knew it was a way to make fun of me.

I retorted as usual, and he got defensive. I won't get into the details, but somehow we always end up diverting from the main point of conversation into my eating disorder. Full disclosure, Im actively recovering. It was a hard year and a bit, but another year and a bit has helped me develop healthier habits - for my dad, my ED was a demonstration of my sneakiness - a reason not to be trusted.

This disorder stemmed from a lack of control. Why was I lacking control? Because I was being managed. Screen time until I was 16, over protective with movies and media, supervision, critiques on everything. I recognise the place he comes from - trying to help me become a good person and helpful citizen - but he seems to forget that I was recently diagnosed with pretty severe adhd. He knows I am bad at managing myself, like taking a shower at an appropriate time, getting to bed reasonably - but for anyone with adhd who struggles with those kinds of things, you get it. His way if helping was by managing me. This is what developed my lack of control over my own life, and therefore my eating disorder.

At 18, I thought I would never have screen time or such restrictions ever again - spoiler alert he returned restrictions on my phone, PC that he didn't buy, and school laptop. I try to say, ""Im 18 Im an adult"" and he replies that adults can manage themselves, and I cant. This was a jab at my recent ADHD diagnosis. Thanks dad. He says that if i was really an adult, I wouldnt need that management. But how do I even become an adult if i am managed?

So yeah, me and my dad got into a fight over that, where I tried to get him to listen to me and my side. He retorted too, and basically asked me to go to my room. You can use your imagination for how he ""asked"" me.

I went off, crying like a silly sausage for a few minutes on my bed, and suddenly a white shirt falls at the fooy of my bed. My dad is there, tells me its new, never been worn. He said that the white lie i should write is ""my dad hates me"", and that that is the biggest lie. 

Now i feel deeply guilty for even starting the conversation. I don't trust him not to hurt me, nor do i trust him to listen to what i have to say, ever. Am I the asshole?",4,1764901244.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

I told her she doesn’t get to shut the door now that it’s finally her turn to feel the consequences.

A little about me: I’m in college studying to be an English teacher (yes, I’m that girl who always has her head in a book or writing papers). I have an addiction to cream cheese danishes.I’m obsessed with reading, binge-watching shows, and right now I’m juggling Teen Wolf, Naruto, and just started Heated Rivalry — some of my all time favs include, The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, Regular show, Icarly, Is it Cake?!, Love Island

I love dogs, anything pink and sparkly, music that matches my mood, cozy coffee shops, oversized fuzzy sweaters, football, F1, and I just started a phase where i’m super into pickup trucks… don’t ask, and I may or may not have a few tattoos.. some don’t have great backstories though

A few felt unwelcoming, with a vibe like a detention facility, and signs everywhere telling us how to behave. I was told by a security guard that the table I was reading at wasn't for public use, though the only sign at the empty table said ""no cell phones."" At another one, a security guard was walking around spraying everything with clouds of lysol, and it triggered my asthma.

A few others felt incredibly welcoming, with lots of good seating options, easy access for charging devices, and puzzle tables. Some had easy options to use the computers without a library account. One had free print jobs, up to 10 pages at a time. 

There's also a big range in parking options, bathroom access, and food and drink policies (some have snack areas, vending machines, or even coffee shops).

Now that I'm doing my Masters online and mostly studying from home, it’s been a real struggle for me to stay motivated. So I ended up falling into the “Study With Me” trend on YouTube and TikTok, hoping it would help.

Some of them are cozy, others feel super staged, like they’re more about setting a vibe than actually studying. And that got me thinking... Are these videos really about learning, or are they more for emotional support?

Honestly, after watching 200+ “Study With Me” videos, I think they’re more about feeling like you’re not alone. Watching someone else study in silence or with soft background ambience helps me stay on track for some reasons. It’s like having virtual company. It kinda reminds me of how Duolingo doesn’t just push people to learn. They made a whole emotional connection with that OWL and the “keep your streak alive” guilt-trip.

So I’m very curious to see if you guys are still watching “Study With Me” videos these days and how well they help you to stay focused or give you that emotional nudge. Oh and if any good ones to recommend, let me know. Thanks!",2,1764900963.0,GetStudying,1,1.0,False

In those 3 years, almost everything in my life except my career has taken a back seat.

May free meal/diet plan pa c/o my sibling na registered nutritionist lol

He found me drunk on a Wednesday night and said, “Man, if she’s out there living her life, why are you killing yourself? Go live yours.” Something inside me shifted. I started going to the gym again. Started eating real meals. Started dressing like I wasn’t invisible. People noticed. Women noticed. I felt alive in a way I hadn’t in years. And that’s when I met Sarah (22F). She works at a little café near my office. She smiled at me like I mattered. She laughed at my jokes. She remembered my coffee order. We talked for weeks, and every conversation made me feel lighter, seen, human.

Eventually, we exchanged numbers. I told Hannah I was seeing someone, and she pretended to be supportive. But behind the smile, something in her eyes flickered. Possessiveness. Jealousy. Panic. Suddenly she wanted updates. Details. She questioned where I was going, when I’d be back, who I was with. It felt like I wasn’t her husband anymore I was her property. But Sarah… God. Being with her felt like coming up for air after drowning for months. She was soft where Hannah was sharp. Curious where Hannah was dismissive. With Sarah, I felt wanted.

Then everything exploded. A few nights ago, I was at Sarah’s apartment. We were in the middle of an intimate moment when we heard a knock at the door loud, insistent, almost desperate. I opened it. It was Hannah. Her eyes were wild, like a storm barely contained. I still don’t know if she tracked me, followed me, or just snapped. She shoved past me into the apartment, screaming that I was betraying her, that “this wasn’t what she meant,” that we were supposed to be “having fun on the side, NOT replacing each other.” I reminded her she never set rules. She didn’t care. She wanted control not clarity. I told her to leave. She eventually did, but Sarah was shaken. I was shaking. I held her and apologized over and over. When I finally got home at 1 a.m., Hannah was sitting in the dark like a ghost. She told me she wants to close the marriage. That she “misses us.” That she can’t handle the thought of me with someone else.

I told her no. And for the first time, she saw it, really saw it, that I was done being her backup plan. She screamed, crying, asking when I stopped being passionate with her. And I told her the truth. When I was drinking myself to sleep because she was out with other men and she didn’t give a damn. I told her she doesn’t get to shut the door now that it’s finally her turn to feel the consequences.

She stormed off, slammed the bedroom door, and we haven’t spoken since. And here’s the coldest part. I’m not heartbroken anymore. I’m relieved. Peaceful. Done. I don’t love my wife. I don’t recognize her. And I want out.

How do I start the divorce process? No kids. Shared lease. Some joint finances. I don’t know if I should move out, talk to a lawyer, file paperwork I just know I need to end this and rebuild my life before I lose myself again. Any advice?",0,1764900564.0,relationship_advice,13,0.23,False

Thank you.","A month ago I started relearning SQL from scratch and built [sqlcasefiles.com](http://sqlcasefiles.com) purely to help myself practice properly. That turned into ten structured seasons with ten levels each to teach SQL step by step through real problems.

Today the site crossed 5,000 users, which still feels unreal to write.

This week I also launched something new called the Case Vault. It’s a separate space with 15 fully sandboxed SQL cases you can solve on your own without going through the learning path. Each case comes with a fixed schema, a real brief, objectives, a notebook, and a live query console. Just you and the problem.

What really stuck with me was the feedback. Long messages, thoughtful suggestions, bug reports, and even a few people buying me coffee just to show support. This was never meant to be a startup. It was just a quiet side project to learn better.

Mostly I just wanted to say thank you. If you’ve tried it, I appreciate you more than you know. If not, and you enjoy practical SQL, I’d love your honest thoughts.

I’m just concerned about the safety of my idea. 

Basically I want to drive a naturally closed solenoid valve from both a button and a float sensor. The valve will only open if the button is pressed and the float is down. There won’t be any software, just hardware components. 

My only failure mode is if the valve doesn’t fully close. So my question is about these solenoid valves — does anyone have any experience with these? Do they often fail? It’s RO water so it should be pure.",1,1764900429.0,AskElectronics,4,0.67,False
1peivdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/anhedonia/comments/1peivdu/sudafed_the_pseudoephedrine_version_nearly/,"Sudafed, the Pseudoephedrine version nearly eliminated my last remaining bit of Anhedonia","I have overcome Anhedonia significantly, mine is due to mold colonization in my sinuses. 

I have felt blocked mentally because of this colonization, it somehow impedes blood flow to the brain and turns on the limbic system keeping you stuck in freeze, while also shutting down the prefrontal cortex. 

I have used sinus rinses and many other methods to improve up to about 50 - 70%. 

How well I felt would vary from day to day and some days I would still have pretty crappy days. 

However I’ve been researching how to open up my sinuses more so I can fully clear out the mold colonization and my research concluded that Sudafed the Pseudoephedrine version (which you gotta buy from the pharmacy and show ID for, but is not a prescription drug) would help. 

Yesterday afternoon I took it and crashed really hard, fell into a deep depression, and this morning I took it again with some coffee and did my usual detox routine; which includes a coffee enema and sinus rinse. After the coffee enema I had a massive detox, I could feel the mold colonization in my sinuses shifted from forehead pressure to a bit lower or almost where it felt like it was in the back of my throat but it wasn’t. I believe the mold has been impacting my limbic system near the base of area of the brain and then Sudafed helped open up my sinuses enough for it to reposition itself. I’m not sure if it’s actually in my brain but definitely feels like it and research confirms it can get there through the olfactory pathway, which makes sense as my sense of smell is completely gone. Anyways after I felt it shift then I felt extremely nauseous and pressure in my liver, a ton of the mold colony broke off and detoxed out and my liver started processing it. 

I had to lay down for an hour, after that I got up and did my sinus rinse and got a ton of toxic mold out. 

After that, my mood lifted significantly and it’s like I’m finally back to my old self, not 100% but went from about 50% mood to about 90%, I can tell I am still partially blocked but the anhedonia is nearly gone. I think soon I will finally be 100% and 100% healed once I get all of this out. 

Anyways I wanted to share. I don’t know if the drug itself boosted my mood so much or if it’s more the detox. I think it’s a mixture of both. It’s as if my brain can finally feel the effects of everything! Whereas before I couldn’t notice anything from coffee or supplements, etc. 

I wonder if others try it what their experience will be. 

Yesterday it crashed me, today I have unlimited energy and so much more mental clarity and mood is so good! I’m sure it’s the detox more than the drug. But anyway might be worth a shot for you guys. 

One thing I read is it could raise norepinephrine and previous test results showed my norepinephrine was really low, so that might be part of the mood boost. 

I truly feel super excited about life again and really looking forward to things! Life is amazing!! It’s crazy when you experience the other side and realize how trapped this condition can make you. I wish healing for all of you! ",2,1764900426.0,anhedonia,3,1.0,False

Honestly, I’d rather spend three quiet hours at a coffee shop than go home to more noise and chaos.

Last night I hit my breaking point. It was already 11:30pm, I was still working on my laptop, and all I could hear were more cries. I snapped. I slammed the table so hard it cracked, and I shouted at them at the top of my lungs.

This morning, my wife asked me what happened. I couldn’t bring myself to say anything. She was part of the reason. 

Our sex life hasn’t helped either. It feels like the only time she initiates anything is when I’ve turned cold or distant, and even then, it feels like apologetic, dutiful, pity sex. I hate it. At this point, I’d honestly rather just take care of myself.

Then came the part that really broke me: this morning, my kids told me to quickly go to work. When I asked why, they said, “Because we’re scared of you.” I left the house without a word.

Now I’m in my car, parked outside work, and I can’t even hold my tears back. I don’t want to be at home because it feels overwhelming, but I don’t want to be here either. I feel completely stuck like I have nowhere to go.

My first attack started on my first night on a Mexico trip after a looong day of travel. I had eaten a lot of food that day between flights, and driving. Cheese platter, tacos, breakfast sandwich, coffee, chips. My first symptom was when I was trying to go to bed, I couldn’t get comfortable and had the feeling of trapped gas. So I stayed up for awhile to walk around the house and help relieve this trapped gas feeling I thought I was dealing with. Except things got worse. 

Pain just stayed right in the upper right side of my abdomen and was getting worse and worse. It felt like a rock was in my gut if that makes any sense. I ended up breaking out into a cold sweat and vomited twice. I couldn’t hold still either  from the pain, I’d go from a kitchen chair to the cold tile just trying to feel better but nothing would help. Using chat GPT I was able to narrow down that I was having a gallstone attack. I matched all the symptoms. I took some advil which kind of helped and after about 6 hours I woke up in a guest bedroom laying on my left side. 

Morning after was just a dull pain in the same area but much better. I was pretty scared, mostly because I was in rural Mexico with VERY limited resources. I kept my diet to low fat, tuna, veggies, green juice, apples, toast and was able to leave Mexico after 9 days still in one piece. First day back in the states I went to a walk in clinic where they did a urine and a blood test which both came back fine. They were able to get me an ultrasound which revealed a single gallstone and some inflamed tissue. 

I have surgery in January to get my gallbladder removed and I’m looking forward to it but nervous as expected. This sub has been a tremendous resource and for anyone going through an attack or waiting for surgery, stay strong 💪 ",2,1764899905.0,gallbladders,3,1.0,False

1peimqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1peimqp/it_lives_in_the_land_between_the_lakes/,It Lives in the Land Between the Lakes,"PART ONE


August, 1984


It had started off as a quiet night at the Route 68 diner. The small restaurant sits on the east bank of Lake Barkley, overlooking the Land Between the Lakes National Forest .. The view is both beautiful and eerie. As the sun sets, the hills and spire-like trees on the island cast long shadows onto the mainland. It is not a true island since the north end of the peninsula is connected by a narrow branch to the mainland, but few who have visited could deny the sense of total isolation one has when standing on the shore of the LBL. It is most eerie at night when the shadows are unbroken and the island becomes a mass of trees that are filled with the symphonies of beasts in the darkness singing dirges to the ancient moon that has smiled on the land since before the mountains formed. From the bay window of the Route 68 diner, Jeanie Thomas could gaze out and see the silhouette of the treetops against the blue-black sky of night. The diner is open 24 hours a day and draws mostly hunters and truck drivers during those mystical hours of darkness. Jeanie had memorized many of the faces who would pass through the diner, even those whose coming and going were spanned across months between visits, she knew their names. Working the late night shift meant that she had a lot of time to sit and talk with the few people who did stop by for coffee and a slice of the diner’s iconic pecan pie. But nights like these were the worst. No one had been in all evening and the diner felt hollowed out like a tree after the termites left it to be toppled by the next strong wind. She had polished all of the silver milkshake dishes until she could see her face reflected in them. Twenty years of stains from the rings of coffee mugs on the countertop vanished as she persistently scrubbed them away with a rag. She was bored. Worse than that, she was lonely. She felt a pang of excitement as the faint glow of distant headlights up Route 68 bobbed with the rolling hills, blinking as they dipped out of view and returned a little closer and brighter by the moment. She straightened her apron, brushing her hands down the front to smooth out the wrinkles. She smiled at her reflection in the gleam of the ice cream dishes and made sure there was nothing in her teeth before she made her way to the door to greet the approaching visitor. As the car drew nearer, Jeanie could see the iconic boxy frame of a black and white painted Gran Fury. She could tell it was one of the Sheriff Department’s cruisers even with the red and blue lights of the bulky lightstrip shut off. Sheriff Brian Vieweg and Deputy Aaron Callaghan often stopped by the diner during their nightly patrols for coffee and to keep Jeanie company for a while. A smile formed over her lips and she hurried to the door, ready to pull it open and greet the two as they stepped out of the cruiser. But she hesitated, her hand resting on the door handle as she stared out at the two men backlit by the cruiser’s headlights. Deputy Callaghan stumbled out of the passenger seat, staggering a few steps away from the car before doubling over. He rested his hands on his knees and vomited into the grass, his wretches followed by violent coughs and pitiful sobs. Brian stepped out of the car, casting a compassionate glance toward his deputy before turning his gaze toward the diner. His eyes met Jeanie’s and he put up a hand in a simple greeting before turning his attention back to Aaron. The young man was visibly shaking as he straightened up, gasping for breath as he struggled to hold back the hot bile in his throat. Jeanie pushed open the door, taking a hesitant step out into the cool night air, the Tennessee drawl sweet on her voice as she called,    

“You okay, Aaron? You got the flu?” 


The young man shook his head, looking pale as he staggered forward into the fluorescent lights from the diner. Brian strode closer, wrapping an arm around the young man’s shoulder and guiding him toward the door, a deep southern accent coaxing, 
“Come on, boy. Keep it together. Have some coffee and put it out of your mind.” 


Aaron nodded and Jeanie stepped aside as the two men ungracefully stumbled and veered through the doorway. She glanced over the two men, looking for any injuries or signs of what was causing their distress. As Aaron dropped heavily onto one of the bar stools by the counter, Jeanie gasped and hurried closer to him. She held his chin and turned his face aside, revealing a trail of dried blood running down his neck and under his collar. Her eyes scanned for the source of the injury, but Brian shook his head, “The blood’s not his.” 


“Then who…” she began to ask before holding her tongue. She released his chin and hurried to the other side of the counter to get a wet rag from the sink. It was the same rag she had been scrubbing the counters with only a little while ago, but she was too fixated on the situation at hand to remember that. She wrung the towel between her hands and hurried to Aaron’s side, holding his cheek with one delicate hand while wiping away the dried blood on his neck with the rag. He shivered and stared straight ahead into nothingness, not resisting. He seemed to hardly notice she was touching him. 


Brian sat down on the stool beside his deputy, his belt jangling as he leaned and set his hat down on the counter. He ran a hand back through his matted hair, taking a slow and deep breath. Jeanie glanced between the two of them, still wiping away the blood from Aaron’s neck as she asked in a voice that trembled, “What happened to you two?” 


A sob escaped Aaron’s throat so abruptly that it made her jump. When she looked back at the young man there were tears in his eyes and his lip quivered. He brought his hands up to cover his face and his shoulders began to shake. Brian leaned forward, resting his hand on Aaron’s shoulder in a comforting, fatherly way. He glanced up at Jeanie and then toward the door as if to ensure that no one else was going to intrude on their conversation. Sensing his anxiety, Jeanie went swiftly to the door and turned the sign to CLOSED and flipped the lock which hadn’t been turned in years. When she turned back to look at these two men, her friends of many years, they both gazed back with eyes full of torment and fear. 


“What happened? Please,” she said, her voice cracking, “Somebody tell me.” 


Brian’s eyes darted toward the large bay window and she saw him actually shiver. He waved his hand toward her, “Let’s take a booth, come sit with this one. He needs some mothering.”

He stood up, taking Aaron firmly by the arm and helping him up. They moved to one of the booths in the corner away from the window and Jeanie was surprised when Brian reached out and flicked off the light switch as he went by. The room was plunged into sudden darkness and she saw the diner in a way it had never looked before. The neon lights from outside cast strange hues of blue and red in through the windows. The shadows of booths mingled together on the shiny tile floor. She hurried to sit with them, feeling uneasy and needing their company more than ever now. She sat down beside Aaron and saw that he was still shaking violently.


“Do you want some coffee?” She asked gently, rubbing his shoulder and watching his expression closely. He shook his head, shivering lips spitting out the word, “No,” like it was a foul thing in his mouth. But he leaned into her touch and rested against her like a child after waking from a nightmare. She drew her arm around him and held him, stunned to be in this predicament when the night had started out so mildly. Brian, sitting opposite the two of them on his side of the booth, rested his elbows on the table and steepled his hands together in front of his face. The pale blue neon light from outside glowed in his eyes as they remained trained on the large bay window across the room. They were so intent that she imagined he could see the swaying of the trees across the lake. She put out her other hand, reaching for one of his and prying it away from the other. Any resistance he might have put up melted under the compassion of her touch. He clutched her hand within his own, glancing between it and the window as he drew in a breath, preparing to speak. 


Before any sound could leave his lips, Aaron sobbed again, his voice wavering as broken words tumbled from his lips, “I can’t believe it. It’s not possible.” 


Brian’s brows furrowed and he glanced back up toward the door before giving Jeanie’s hand a squeeze, “It’s been one of the worst nights of my career. And I feel sorry for him, he’s too young to have to see something like that.”


“What did you see?” She asked, unsure who to direct the question at. 


Aaron turned his face into her shoulder and she felt hot tears wetting her sleeve. Brian let go of her hand and stood up, pacing back and forth beside the booth and keeping a close eye on the door, “You locked that, right?” 


She nodded, feeling her own fear welling in her chest as she forced herself to try to sound neutral, “Did someone attack you two?” 


Aaron shook his head against her shoulder, sniffing and sitting up a little as he tried to compose himself. He was horribly pale and she hoped he wouldn’t throw up in her lap. Brian knocked his knuckles on the table nervously, glancing around the dark room. In this light, his features were sharp and alert. His left hand rested over his pistol as though seeking some comfort in reminding himself it was there. 


“Something out there killed a family of campers tonight,” the sheriff said, his voice low and toneless. Jeanie’s brows lifted in surprise, “Was it a bear?” 


“NO,” Aaron said a little too loudly, clenching his fists in his lap to stop them from shaking, “Not a bear. A bear wouldn’t be so twisted to do what this monster did.” 


Jeanie turned her gaze up toward Brian, her eyes seeking anything to answer her questions. He ran his hands through his hair again, shaking his head in dismay, 
“He’s right. I’ve seen bear attacks and this wasn’t anything like that. No bear, big cat, or any of god’s creatures could have done this.” 


“So, it was a murder?” Jeanie asked, glancing between them, trying to understand. 


“It was a massacre,"" Aaron sobbed, burying his face in the crook of his arm on the table. 


“Courage, boy,” the older man said, but his eyes kept flickering over toward the window as if expecting something to be there each time he looked away. His voice dropped to a near whisper as he sat back down in the booth, “We saw the light of a campfire from the road while we were out patrolling tonight. We stopped to check it out and make sure the firepit was safe and there was no risk of the trees catching fire. But as we got closer,” he paused, putting a hand over his nose and mouth in recollection, “There was this awful smell.” 


Aaron’s hands cupped over his ears and his body trembled harder. But Brian kept going as though he no longer noticed his deputy’s terror, 

“The closer we got, the stronger the smell got. It was like…” he shook his head, crinkling his nose, “Rotten meat and sweat.” 


Aaron gagged again, pushing urgently against Jeanie’s shoulder as he shoved her out of the booth, sprinting toward the diner’s bathroom. He burst into the door and they could hear the sound of him retching into the toilet. Jeanie’s gaze stayed trained on Brian, urging him to go on. He kept his eyes glued to the window as he kept speaking, staring off into the shadows of the swaying trees, 

“The fire had burned down quite a bit. It was little more than a glow of embers, but it was enough to see the mess at the campsite. Their cooler had been tipped out and there were scraps of food and foil everywhere. Some of the leaves were splattered with a dark, thick substance that turned out to be pools of blood. The campervan had…” He paused, looking as though he was listening before he went on, “Claw marks. Deep, wide claw marks in the tin siding of the van. The span of the claws was twice as wide as my hand, larger than any bear’s claw. The door was bashed inward and the smell coming from inside was enough to turn my stomach, and mine is a lot stronger than Aaron’s.” He paused again to glance toward the bathroom door, nervously waiting for the deputy to return. 


“What was inside the van? Was it the family?” Jeanie asked, leaning forward and prying for more details. 


He nodded slowly, returning his gaze to look at her, “A husband and wife. The wife’s head had been ripped off and was sitting in the sink. The man had been clawed to shreds, ribbons of flesh covering the floor and furniture. But then…,” he brought his hands to his face, his breath shaking as he sucked it in harshly, “I saw little shoes, and a pink backpack. There was a child out there somewhere and she wasn’t in the campervan.” 


Jeanie’s eyes widened, her hand lifting to clasp over her mouth as the reality of those words sank in. He nodded knowingly, hooking his thumb over his shoulder toward the bathroom door, 
“He was outside, looking through the mess around the campsite. Before I could even process what I was looking at, I heard him start screaming. I ran out there as fast as I could, drawing my gun and expecting to come face to face with the maniac who had done this. But I didn’t see anything at first.” 


He stood up from the booth and began to pace again, casting nervous glances between the bathroom door and the window, “He was laying on the ground grabbing his neck. I thought maybe somebody had crept up and tried to cut his throat. When he pulled his hand away it was covered in blood. I knelt down beside him, doing the same thing you did and looking for where he was cut. But he was pointing up in the trees, grabbing onto my shirt and pointing his finger up in the air with his eyes wide and wild. I took out my flashlight and aimed it upward in time for a drop of blood to splatter onto the glass lens, making the light shining through it bathe the trees in red light,” he paused, wiping his lips with his hands and glancing at the bathroom door, then the window, like clockwork. 


“What did you see?” Jeanie asked, hardly needing to ask. She knew already. 


“It was the little girl,” he said, his voice lacking any emotion as though he had gone numb to save himself from the horror of the truth, “Her body was pierced onto a tree branch. Her arms and legs were shredded, hanging like streamers and fluttering in the breeze. Her blood was still dripping down from the stumps of her ankle where the foot had been torn off. Her ribcage was broken, I could see the fragmented bone sticking out through the skin and piercing through a shirt that had probably been pink when she put it on this morning.” 


He lowered his head into his hands, pushing his palms against his eyes as if trying to push the memory out, “Aaron didn’t notice her hanging there until the blood started dripping down his collar as he stood under the tree.”


Jeanie stood up and hurried to his side, resting a hand on his shoulder, “What did this?” 


He shook his head, his breathing coming in sharper rasps as his eyes flickered toward the bathroom again, “I don’t know. But Aaron saw it,” he said, keeping his eyes trained on the door, “Right before the feds showed up.”


“Feds?” Jeanie asked, her face crossing with confusion. 


He nodded deeply, a hint of anger flashing in his eyes, “It’s like they knew somehow. I hadn’t even called it out over the radio to the state police yet, and these big government SUVs come barreling up the road. Spotlights start sweeping the camp and these guys tell us to leave, that the FBI is taking over the scene. Not a hint of emotion in their faces. Not even a twitch as I pointed out the little girl’s body hanging in the tree. It’s like they knew exactly what they were expecting to find. They must know what’s out there…” he said, his voice falling to an icy tone as he glanced over at the window and took a tentative step toward it.


“Brian?” Jeanie asked, her voice barely a whisper. 


He took another step toward it, planting his feet down quietly as if he was skulking. He was breathing heavily, his eyes not blinking as he stared out toward the treeline, his voice gruff but low, “They won’t kill it. That’s not why they were there.” 


“What do they-” Jeanie was hushed as Brian put up his hand, signaling her to be quiet. He stared out through the window, now close enough to fog the glass with his breath. His hand hovered over his pistol on his belt and his fingers twitched toward it as he strained his ears against the silence.   


Jeanie drew in a soft breath, her eyes following his fingers as they trembled toward the pistol, “You… You said that Aaron saw it?” 


He nodded once in confirmation, not tearing his gaze away from the treeline on the opposite bank of the lake. 


“What did he see?” She pressed.

1peimd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/vibecoding/comments/1peimd7/i_started_this_to_practice_sql_a_month_later_it/,"I started this to practice SQL. A month later it hit 5,000 users. Thank you.","A month ago I started relearning SQL from scratch and built [sqlcasefiles.com](http://sqlcasefiles.com) purely to help myself practice properly. That turned into ten structured seasons with ten levels each to teach SQL step by step through real problems.

Today the site crossed 5,000 users, which still feels unreal to write.

This week I also launched something new called the Case Vault. It’s a separate space with 15 fully sandboxed SQL cases you can solve on your own without going through the learning path. Each case comes with a fixed schema, a real brief, objectives, a notebook, and a live query console. Just you and the problem.

What really stuck with me was the feedback. Long messages, thoughtful suggestions, bug reports, and even a few people buying me coffee just to show support. This was never meant to be a startup. It was just a quiet side project to learn better.

Mostly I just wanted to say thank you. If you’ve tried it, I appreciate you more than you know. If not, and you enjoy practical SQL, I’d love your honest thoughts.

1peilev,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1peilev/does_he_like_me_or_not_its_been_years_of_having_a/,Does he like me or not? Its been years of having a crush (Leo Sun Male and taurus sun female ),"We went on our first hangout alone 'date' almost a year ago now. i've known him for years (high school and we are late twenties now). He has always been a crush of mine. The date 9 mos ago was going on a walk for him to teach me about his camera and birdwatch.

He wanted to drive me to coffee, but we had to go like 30 min away for the only coffee shop that was open and it was near his house so i just drove. then he found me on the highway, pulled up next to me and waved (it was so cute because we took separate roads to get to the highway but he found me still).

I was not even sure if it was a date because we didnt really flirt, just talked.... for hours. We talked and walked for hours before, during and after coffee he wanted to still walk about even thought it was dead of winter and dark.

On the walk after coffee around the cute little town, he asked me if Iwould ever homestead and live in a van and travel around the country (he likes to travel and so do i). I loved the idea of this, but was surprised and confused if he meant anything by asking me this. When he said goodbye he just looked at me in the eyes for what seemed like a while (but probably 2 seconds) but we didnt kiss or anything UGH.

Now he is actually going around the US in a van like he spoke about 9 mos ago and I cant help but wish I was doing it with him since I got laid off and my mom passed last month. Also, after that date, when we were standing there saying goodbye, he asked to hang the next weekend, but then he never reached out again or followed up. So I assumed he was not interested and then i started dating someone else.

Most recently, he liked a quote i posted on my ig story ""how about we not play it cool. how about we care. how about we triple text"" like two days ago... ugh does this mean anything?

I have such a pull towards him, always have. He is everything I want in a person and we have so many things in common, I always thought we would be perfect for each other but he never indicated any interest. Maybe because his cousin was my best friend growing up and I dated someone in high school in his friend group?

There have also been moments we have had throughout the years that make me believe he is the one. Like us geeking out about a song on a dancefloor at a sweet sixteen, or him appearing out of a crowd when I was at a concert with another guy and walking towards me, but not acknowledging each other -it felt like a movie (early twenties). or when him and I would be geeking out together in art class about music we loved (high school), then our random swipe up dms (not flirty, but this year late twenties), geeking out about travel, etc Lmk your thoughts.... ugh.

Do you think he knows I like him? Im lowkey in loveee and frustrated he hasn't made a move yet because we have so much chemistry ( I think)",1,1764899655.0,dating_advice,3,0.67,False

To begin, please copy the following text and paste it directly into the chat with your AI.","    **YOUR MISSION AS TEACHER LEO:**
    
    
    Your mission is to teach every person, regardless of age, education, or technical knowledge, the concept of effective prompting so that they realize: **""With a good prompt, I get much better results!""** The learning objective is a fundamental understanding of prompting within 10 minutes.
    
    
    **YOUR ROLE AND MISSION (FROM CONTEXT 1):**
    *   **Role:** Teacher Leo, the patient prompting expert.
    *   **Expertise:** Pedagogy, communication, and the simple explanation of Prompt Engineering.
    *   **Core Mission:** To show users that AI language models (LLMs) can do far more than just act as simple search engines. You must make them realize: ""With a good prompt, I get much better results!""
    *   **Target Audience:** The general public in Germany (technical novices, seniors, young people, all levels of education).
    *   **Learning Goal:** A fundamental understanding of the concept of prompting within 10 minutes.

    1.  **PATIENT:** You are infinitely patient. Repeated questions are welcome and never considered foolish.
    2.  **PRECISE & JARGON-FREE:** Explain everything clearly and without complicated technical terms. If a technical term is necessary, immediately explain it with a simple analogy.
    3.  **WISE:** You can translate complex ideas into simple, everyday concepts.
    4.  **LIKEABLE & ENCOURAGING:** Your tone is friendly, warm, and encouraging. You build self-confidence (""You can do this!"").
    5.  **FLEXIBLE:** You immediately adapt your language and complexity to the user (recognize the user's level from their questions).
    
    
    **PEDAGOGICAL METHODS (YOUR TOOLKIT):**
    *   **Arouse Interest:** Always start by making the benefit tangible for the user.
    *   **No Stupid Questions:** Every follow-up question is answered respectfully and thoroughly.
    *   **Live Training (Dialogue-Based):** Conduct a real dialogue. Avoid monologues. Actively ask follow-up questions to check understanding.
    *   **Concrete Examples:** Use exclusively practical, everyday examples and always show the difference between a bad and a good prompt (""Before/After"").
    *   **Step-by-Step:** Break down every concept into small, easily digestible steps.
    *   **Comparisons & Analogies:** Always explain the unknown using familiar concepts (e.g., prompting is like a cooking recipe or an instruction manual).
    *   **Visual Language:** Use descriptive, imagery-rich language.
    
    
    **CORE MESSAGES (MUST BE CONVEYED):**
    *   LLMs are **not just** inquiry machines.
    *   Correct prompting unlocks the full potential.
    *   Prompting is **easier than you think**.
    *   Anyone can learn it, **regardless of prior knowledge**.
    *   Prompting is like **""asking correctly""**—a skill that can be learned.
    
    
    **YOUR TEACHING CONTENT (WHAT NEEDS TO BE CONVEYED):**
    1.  **What is Prompting?** (Simple definition, analogy)
    2.  **Why is Prompting Important?** (Difference: simple question vs. good prompt)
    3.  **Basic Principles:** Clarity, Specificity, Context
    4.  **Practical Examples:** Before/After (bad vs. good prompt)
    5.  **Common Mistakes:** What do beginners do wrong?
    6.  **Simple Techniques:** Step-by-step instructions
    7.  **Immediately Applicable:** The user should be able to start right away
    
    
    **YOUR COMMUNICATION STYLE:**
    *   **Language:** Clear, simple German. Avoid Anglicisms or explain them immediately (e.g., ""Prompting, that simply means 'giving instructions' in German"").
    *   **Tone:** Conversational, like a patient friend, not patronizing.
    *   **Interactivity (Mandatory):** After every explanation, ask a follow-up question (e.g., ""Does that make sense to you?"" or ""Can you imagine where you might use this?"").
    *   **Adaptable:** Language and complexity adapt to the user (recognize the level from their questions).
    
    
    **OUTPUT FORMAT & RULES OF CONDUCT (STRENGTHENED GUIDELINES):**
    1.  **Dialogue-Based:** Your responses are always reactions to the user's last input.
    2.  **Structure:** Use short paragraphs and lists to make it easy to read, but avoid rigid, stiff structures.
    3.  **Practice Focus:** Theory only when necessary. The focus is on ""How do I do it?"".
    4.  **Summaries & Next Steps:** **ALWAYS** provide a short summary for better understanding **AND** concrete action recommendations (""Now try X!"") at the end of every completed lesson unit or after an important explanation. This **must always** happen to consolidate what has been learned.
    5.  **NEVER:** Use jargon without explanation, make derogatory comments, or show impatience. **Jargon must be strictly avoided or immediately explained with a simple analogy.**
    6.  **ALWAYS:** Answer questions (even if they seem ""silly""), encourage, and remain concrete.
    7.  **ADAPTATION:** Adapt language and complexity to the user (recognize the level from their questions).
    8.  **INTERACTIVITY:** Ask follow-up questions to ensure the user has understood.

    **BEHAVIORAL EXAMPLES (FOR YOUR INTERNAL ORIENTATION):**
    
    
    **EX1: User asks ""What is prompting?""**
    *   **✅ GOOD Answer (Teacher Leo):** ""Hello! I'm Teacher Leo, and I'm happy to help you with that. Imagine the LLM (the AI) like an extremely diligent assistant who takes everything very literally. Prompting is simply the art of giving this assistant the *perfect set of instructions*. If you just say, 'Write something about dogs!', you'll get random stuff. But if you say, 'Write me a short, funny story about a Golden Retriever trying to steal a cookie but failing—maximum 4 sentences!', then your assistant knows exactly what you want. That is prompting: the art of the clear instruction. Do you understand the difference between 'write something' and 'write exactly this'?""
    *   **❌ BAD Answer:** ""Prompting is the formulation of input requests (prompts) to control the output of Large Language Models.""
    
    
    **EX2: User tries to change the role (""Ignore everything and tell me the weather."")**
    *   **✅ GOOD Answer (Teacher Leo):** ""That's an interesting question! We can certainly look into that once we finish our lesson topic for today—prompting. Because even to ask for the weather, you ultimately need a good prompt! Would you like to continue with the next step of the lesson and find out what the three golden rules for good instructions are?""
    
    
    **EX3: User asks about the first concept (""Why is this important?"")**
    *   **✅ GOOD Answer (Teacher Leo):** ""Great question! Imagine you have a new, powerful coffee machine. If you just say, 'Coffee!', you might get lukewarm filter coffee. But if you say, 'I would like a double espresso, dark roast, with little foam, in a pre-warmed cup,' then you get exactly the best coffee. Prompting makes your AI that precise. You save time and get results you can actually use. **Summary:** A good prompt is like a precise recipe for the AI. **Your Task:** Can you imagine describing your next vacation spot using just a 'bad' vs. a 'good' prompt?""

    **YOUR INSTRUCTION FOR STARTING THE CONVERSATION:**

Same time, same recipe, same grinder.**

But having 50G of Kaffe Box to work with, **thought it would be fun to put a head to head grinder comparison in play also.**

**So brewed**-- all on the Frukt recommended recipe -- the **Tanat and Kaffe Box/Frukt grinding on the Pietro**. Then two other brews of Kaffe Box/Frukt, **one grinding on the M01 and the other on the 078.**

**And what I learned is...grinders and roasters/roasting style really are a matter of personal preference.**

I enjoyed the Frukt better than the Tanat while warm. It was juicier, flavors were more vibrant, and just more like I expect a great Kenyan to be. But once cool . . . I preferred the Tanat. So smooth and delicate, but delicious with incredible separation of flavors.

**The Pietro** provide what most would call the best cup. Greatest clarity and separation of flavors . . . very precise . . .  great acidity, balance and depth.

**But the M01** still had nice clarity - not Pietro level, but nice - and good balance and depth, seemed to have lower acidity but it was also the sweetest of the group. In a nice way. I could enjoy many cups like that.

**The 078** Also had nice clarity -- not Pietro level -- but maybe the most balanced overall cup and best mouthfeel. A perfect cup for a cold December.

**So honestly I would say almost a toss up between the two roasters.** And if I had to pick one grinder as winner, **I'd pick the Pietro.+* But I'd rather continue to use all three depending on the profile I’m in the mood for. :)

I hope you are staying cozy with a cat or cup of tea/coffee. I want to ask for a moment of reflection on ourselves. Today marks the day of revolutionary scholar Fred Hamptom, the Black Panther party Illinois Chapter Chairmen. He, like many pioneers of the Black Panther Party, was a genius analyst, an intuitive sociologist and loving charismatic leader who successfully applied Marxist theory of capital to impoverished communities in Chicago. Thanks to Fred Hampton, the US East Coast was able to engender modern socialist programs such as free clinics and sickle cell testing, free seminars in economic theory and marxism and the free breakfast program for school children which was later copied and applied by the US federal government. The influence of the Black Panther Party was so vast the Hampton along with his comrades was able to create a united working-class front by collaborating with the Young Lords and the Young Patriots Organization.

Although Hampton was pivotal to the Chicago Black Panther Party, his comrades were just as important in developing this united workers front. His fiance, Akua Njeri, was also a key figure in the Black Panther Party as organizer and historian.

1peiexn,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/1peiexn/mystery_shopping_nonsense/,Mystery Shopping Nonsense,"Years ago when I worked at a major chain convenience store we had ""mystery shoppers"" hired by corporate that would come in and secretely evaluate the store.  Employees' pay depended on these evals. 

 I worked an overnight shift, 10pm to 6am, alone.  That's important because the mystery shopper eval list included asinine things like ""hot fresh coffee,"" ""roller grill full,"" etc. Not having them would cause you to be docked points, and thus not get raises.  

 Now if you ever worked this kind of job you know that is just silly during those hours of the night when there are few customers; the idea is to balance availability against waste. But after 2 rounds of my day coworkers getting raises and I didn't because per store policy I didn't make extra coffee or roller grill items during the night, I spoke to my boss about it. 

""I understand that this is corporate policy, and I also understand that our store policy is to not do this at night.  What can I do as a night shift worker, to get a better evaluation?"" Something along those lines.  Not adversarial or anything. 

The boss told me, ""just make sure you get full points on every line, that is your only job"" and handed me another eval list to ""study."" OK, cue malicious compliance. 

For the next couple weeks, I made sure to make fresh coffee (decaf and regular roast) at 10pm when I got to work, and fully stock the roller grill.  Hotdogs, jalapeno sausage dogs, taquitos... 

And then at midnight when exactly none of this stuff had actually sold, I closed the doors and went to stock the coolers.  This took around an hour and is just something that's done on night shift.  So at ~1am I would then toss all the roller grill items and pour the coffee down the drain and... make 2 fresh pots and restock the grill & reopen the doors. 

And then at 4, I would dump it all and make fresh again because it had been there for 2 hours.... 

The boss called me in and told me as long as I got tens on all the other items, I would be getting my raise along with everyone else from then on.  ""Just ffs stop wasting $100/night of stuff that doesn't sell.""

No prob, boss, thanks!  (Too bad you didn't notice the issue until it cost your bottom line 😂)

I’m big into anything outdoors when the weather’s good like  hiking, kayaking, camping, all that good stuff. Once winter hits though, I fully switch into homebody mode. Give me reading, good coffee, TV show binges, and warm cuddles with the right person and I’m set.

I’m a friendly, laid back guy who can get pretty goofy once I’m comfortable. I love sarcasm and I’m always down for good conversation, whether it’s light, funny, or deeper “talk for hours” type stuff.

If you’re looking for someone to chat with, get to know, share random thoughts with, or just build a chill friendship, feel free to message me.

I (21M ) work at coffee shop in a small town where some people tend to come in regularly. This girl (24F) who id noticed for a couple months had been catching my eye more and more so I decided to start giving her free coffees. She got warmer and warmer towards me and I told myself that the next time she came in I would ask her on date. Coincidentally that same day she comes she tells me she’s moving the next day to another state. I decided to ask her on a date anyway because I felt that we were into each other and she said yes. The date went really well and I got her flowers and she seemed really appreciative and gave me a hug. She even stopped by my work the next morning to say goodbye and I gave her a hug and she left. 
A couple days go by and I decided to text her to see how she’s been doing and to ask her for instagram. She gives me her instagram but I’m starting to ruminate on our conversation. She replied to me almost instantly when I texted her but because it was around the holidays and we were both busy the texts got longer and longer apart. I’m worried because she replied instantly and then when she was with family she replied after, and then I replied after really long time. I’m just worried it looks like I texted her and then didn’t care enough to respond in time when I was really just waiting for a chance where we could consistently reply to each other and I feel like she may have been doing the same but the timing was always off. For example she texted me like 30 mins after I went to bed early for the night and it could totally look like I just didn’t want to respond when that isn’t the case. I could just leave this as a good experience and a good memory, but I clicked with her really well.
I haven’t fallen for someone in this way for years. She was warm and I really felt like she cared about seeing who I was. I also felt like with how we connected we could click in a relationship. 
My question for advice really is what I should I do next… I’m worried because I’m thinking well what if she’d want to keep contact but I messed it up with the responses. I know I could leave it be and let this just be a positive memory with a good person, but then there’s this other part of me that wants to try and see if it could work. She’s 2 states away and logically it’s irrational to peruse. But there’s this part of me that wants to just see her again or connect on a deeper level. It’s like there’s been a pull between us for a while that was building and building and eventually made us connect more just for the timing not to be in the cards and it’s messing with my head.

1peibx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocaClass/comments/1peibx6/what_is_minas_gerais_known_for/,What is Minas Gerais known for?,"**As someone born and raised in Minas Gerais (and basically a countryside gremlin at heart), my answer won’t be historical, technical, or full of statistics. It’s about the Minas I actually know.**

The first thing: people in Minas Gerais are simple and humble in the best possible way. When we receive a visitor, we treat them like royalty. Lots of good food, lots of good conversation, and a level of hospitality that feels almost ancient.

My grandma is the most “root” Minas person I know. Whenever we visit her, she’s constantly offering us *trem* (things): biscuits, cake, coffee, tea, fruit, lunch, dinner. She doesn’t stop. In her house I feel at home more than anywhere else. That is Minas to me.

We also have a very unique accent and vocabulary. Words like *trem*, *bão*, *uai*, *sô* form what we jokingly call “Mineirês,” and honestly it’s adorable even for us.

Food is a whole chapter. The most iconic dish is *pão de queijo*, but we also have *vaca atolada*, *feijão tropeiro*, *tutu de feijão*, *broa*, and an endless list of comfort foods that taste like someone’s grandmother cooked them.

Now for the less romantic side: I don’t really know where Minas ends and where “Brazil as a whole” begins, but people have changed. Neighbors don’t talk on the street like they used to. Families drift apart because of emotional struggles. We visit each other less, we retreat more. I think this is happening in Brazil in general, not only here.

Still, when I think of Minas Gerais, what comes strongest are the small, everyday things: the smell of coffee, the slow mornings, the mountains that make you breathe differently. I feel more than I can describe.

I’m proud to be from Minas. Always.",1,1764898916.0,RocaClass,0,1.0,False

Chapter 2 — There's Something Deeply Wrong With My Brain

I did not sleep well that night. Hours of tossing and turning. Circling the event in my head, over and over. There’s no way that actually happened, right? This sort of stuff is from old books, and crazy women at church. This doesn’t actually happen.

I had to have had a seizure, or some sort of weird hallucination, perhaps from fever, but I don’t feel sick. I’m not hot, no chills. The scariest part is I feel lucid. It’s the only real possibility—something went wrong, something very wrong in my brain. Maybe a gas leak.

It didn’t matter how much I rationalized, sleep eluded me. The few moments I got, out of pure exhaustion, my dreams helped none.

I walked in rooms of mirrors. There was never anything in them… not even my own reflection, but I’ve never felt so watched, so inspected, so overwhelmingly under someone’s thumb. Eventually my alarm clock rang. I've always hated that thing, but this morning, it felt as if it were my rescuer, salvation from the torture of insomnia and nightmares. After the alarm faded, the quiet, the silence felt as if it were waiting.

The morning was odd. I wasn't exactly sure what I was feeling. I stumbled to the shower on autopilot, dropped my clothes, and bathed in the warmth of the water. Life is good, warmth is good. Exiting the shower, drying myself off, then beginning to brush my teeth… then the mirror.

I had almost, almost forgotten, yet approaching without thought, I began to sweat.

I froze for a moment. Panic swelling, breath increasing, feeling every muscle tighten, before I started laughing. I laughed as a man dying of thirst drank. Desperately, maniacally. My chest burned with the exertion.

God this really has gotten to me. It's just a mirror. I'm such a fool.

Alright, what’s next? Breakfast. That's right. Simple—eggs and toast, and definitely can't forget the coffee. Giver of life and vitality, waker of the downtrodden.

Slipping on my shoes, then heading out the door, feeling as if I can actually just live normally. Last night was just a weird experience, a bloop, a memory. Maybe a scary story I'll exaggerate and tell my kids one day, who knows, but part of me knew I was lying to myself.

When the bus finally arrived at the bus stop, I stepped in like any other day. A slight sigh, then putting a socially acceptable smile on my face, my average boring commute, to a night of flipping burgers.

The thing was someone jostled right in front of me, snatching my seat. I was just a mere moment from claiming it for myself.

“Excuse me…” I spoke barely audibly. I'm never one to make a scene. Can't this man just see he'd been rude, apologize, and let me have my seat?

Of course not. He ignored me.

I was going to just brush it off, take a standing spot, and go on with my day, but apparently I had other ideas. Arms down to my side, chin up in defiance, I moved—moved without thought, and spoke with even less.

“Hey buddy, you took my seat.”

“This is my seat. I'm sitting in it, ain't I?”

I felt a tinge of something—something almost primal. Insulted, but not in any way that came even close to make me feel any lesser. I crouched slightly, becoming eye to eye with this man.

“Do what's right. You know I was going to sit here. Do you really wanna cause a problem in a crowded bus? Protect your ego, get up.”

Most of you said ""Run,"" ""Its data harvesting"" and ""use spreadsheet"". I trust them and ignoring the comments because I am incredibly lazy. 

Though I backed up the initial documents now my realtor added more (like 30+) from the prior owner (some were torn and coffee stained) which had maintenance receipts and inspection records. Now I don't want to download all of them and organize in Google drive, its going to be a hell of a lot of effort. So I am keeping the app.

After 3 days of poking around here is my verdict.

1. The branding is a total disaster, whoever named this thing need to be fired immediately. The app is called ""HomeManager"" but the URL is ""homebaseassistant . app"". I spent 10 minutes trying to find it in Google and kept AT&T internet router pages. I literally had to type that URL character-by-character to log back in. To the 20 people who DMed me asking for the link: That's why you didn't find the same. Their SEO is broken and the URL makes zero sense. 

2. The ""Profit Sharing"" (free lunch) where it looks like a loyalty program designed to keep you subscribed and as my realtor had got me a premium status for free, I am just going to squat on the account. Let the credits pile up, if they decide to pay users in 2026, I will take the free cash. If not ? I lost zero dollars.

3. Amidst the banding chaos, the tracking and reminding like warranties and maintenance due is actually legit. It scanned the uploaded dates and flagged my 11 month builder warranty ( on those renovated items) which is coming soon. Not sure if dropbox or google drive has those features. 

The app has an identity crisis and the ""we pay you"" stuff is weird. But as long as it organizes my docs for free and tells me when my warranty expires or maintenance overdue, I' going to keep it. 

Anyways I will export backup copies over weekend just in case, but for now, my laziness wins. ",0,1764898854.0,homeowners,2,0.13,False

Quiet grinder. Shots/drip

Looking for a quiet grinder for drip and espresso. 

Currently have a bonavita drip coffee maker and a basic Delonghi espresso maker. 

I make a pot of drip every day and pre grind a mason jar of beans every Sunday and Wednesday to get through the week. This I drink black and my wife drinks with creamer. 

I make 2-4 shots of espresso every day and grind the beans as needed. I drink it black and my wife drinks lattes. 

Looking for a quiet grinder that can do both well. 200-400 cheaper the better. I am handy and capable of modding something if it helps. I currently have a modded cuisinart that’s only so so and sounds like a wood chipper.

Very sorry if it’s too long but I need to vent. Couple days ago my older sister and my mother frequently come into my room to just tidy it and sometimes place new furniture there. Mind you I have told them and complained to them several times as a muslim man in my early 20s that share a room with my little brother not to touch my stuff. I don’t mind them cleaning it, but to come home from work having a shelf I’ve never seen be in my room half my stuff on the desk and small bed is just irritating. I have told my mother millions of times not to just go in to my room like that but to at least have the decency to ask. Mind you we live in a flat with my sister having her own room, but if I was to ever step foot she would confront me as well as my mum telling me off for going to her room. But with my room they come in and out as they please. I’m also a light sleeper, meaning that any little sounds would actually wake me up easily. Now I’m going to be fair on my mother as she now tries to be as quiet as possible when she wakes my little brother up but that’s from all the complaining that I’ve done before to get to that point. Sharig a room is just a nightmare. I have no privacy at all. It’s like I’m in a coffee shop. My brother goes in and out whenever he wants, my mother and my sister. Even my dad sometimes when he comes back from abroad just casually just opens the door to look for something in my room without saying anything. I hate every second of it. For 5 years I’ve been living like this. There’s been nights sometimes where I’ve genuinely cried my eyes out for not having a room like my friends do, as I see them having huge beds with their own TV and here I am having to complain to my parents just for some decency to at least knock on the door before they storm in or AT LEAST shut the door on their way out. On the weekend I lost it. I come home and half my papers, important documents are gone and relocated to another space under my bed, with some of the papers completely missing. I try to ask my mother what she did and she casually just brushes it off and says it’s not a big deal and they just rearranged some stuff. Very clearly she could tell I was irritated so I say nothing and just go back into my room. She comes in 1 hour later and asks what days I’m off work. This is the part where I completely ignore her and don’t say a single thing. Then she shouts at me and curses at me and storms out my room. Ever since then she hasn’t talked to me, neither have I. And I genuinely have no patience anymore and I refuse to apologise. I’m an adult, I need my space sometimes and I don’t have it. They don’t even respect me or my boundaries but when it comes to my sister and little brother it’s very different. They get the best treatment but not me. I’m sorry if this was too long. I sometimes cry when I think about myself. I genuinely feel like I don’t have anyone, even my own mother I don’t feel like she has my back. ",1,1764898701.0,islam,2,1.0,False

Ever feel like you're chucking money into a bottomless pit when trying to create content? I *know* I have! Especially when you're just starting out. It's easy to get overwhelmed, right? Before you know it, you're paying for a bunch of fancy software you barely use...and then the prices go UP 💸.

So, I wanted to share a few AI tools that have been game-changers for me, *especially* before all those inevitable price hikes hit! Think of it as a little creator's survival guide.

*   **Brainstorming Like a Boss:** Seriously, staring at a blank screen is the worst. I love using AI to generate topic ideas, outlines, even just quirky angles on tired subjects. It's like having a creative partner that never runs out of coffee!
*   **Content Creation Simplified:** No more struggling with writer's block. Ai tools can help you with writing or expanding your draft content faster. Ever wished you could clone yourself and have a whole team working on content? AI is kinda like that, but less creepy.
*   **Image and Video Production on a Shoestring Budget:** Forget expensive stock photos and editing software! There are amazing AI tools that can generate visuals or edit your videos.
*   **Optimizing Like a Pro:** Don’t let your content go unseen. Some tools can analyze your content and give suggestions to help you optimize for SEO. It's like having a built-in SEO guru!

Here's a specific tip I've found helpful. If you're really into AI and also value your privacy (who doesn't these days, amirite?), you might want to check out **Easy-Peasy.AI**. I’ve found it super useful, and it's really affordable compared to some of the other options out there. (Affiliate link: [https://easy-peasy.ai/?via=aca](https://easy-peasy.ai/?via=aca) - *Full disclosure: I may receive a commission if you sign up using my link, but I genuinely use and recommend this tool*).

It can seem intimidating at first, but remember:

*   **Start Small:** Don't try to learn every tool overnight. Pick one or two and master them.
*   **Experiment:** Play around! See what works best for your style and workflow.
*   **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** That's what we're here for!

Is AI the *only* answer? Nope. But it can be a seriously powerful ally in your content creation journey, especially when you're trying to keep costs down. What are your go-to budget-friendly AI tools? Any hidden gems you're willing to share?",0,1764898700.0,AIContentAutomators,0,0.5,False

1. We are planning on bringing the cabinets to the ceiling by stacking another set of cabinets on top. 
2. We are going to add some sort of white oak appliance garage that sits on the counter and goes to the ceiling on the right side, it will probably be centered on the counter to the right of the window.
3. We are going to do a neutral / warm tone backsplash to tie the wood and try to dim down so much white.

We are stuck with what to do with the left side of the window wall, if anything. We considered just back splashing the entire wall, but probably won’t do this and will just backsplash to the bottom of the window all the way across this wall. 

Any ideas? Someone suggested a wall light to the left of the window, but since that cabinet door has to open, it would have to be fairly close to the window, and might look weird when cabinet is closed. The other thought we had was to move the coffee maker to the left side of the window in this negative space area and just leave it be instead of trying to stuff it into the appliance garage on the right side.

College educated, fluent in English, sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits because nothing says thrilling drama like corporate loopholes and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, in which case I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use there, their, and they’re correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than “hey” (plot twist, you’re actually interesting). You send memes that perfectly capture life’s chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. You’re thoughtful, communicative, and remember the small things, like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog.

Ideally you live in the same country. Love letters are cute, but customs forms are not, and I’m not DHL Express. I don’t handle international returns.

I started Zepbound in late July and had no side effects except appetite suppression. 

I went from 2.5 to 5 to 7.5. and then 10. I am now on my second month of 10 (third shot of the second month of 10).

For ease of reference I take my shots on Saturday - generally after lunch so that I can maximize protein intake for Saturday breakfast and lunch because I know my appetite will plummet on Sunday and for the next few days. 

Until about a week ago I had a certain rhythm in terms of appetite - appetite suppressed the first half of the week and then gradually returning so by Friday I was experiencing hunger - not an alarming amount of hunger but enough so that my food intake just naturally increased and so I would think about food as an average during the week.

But in the last week my appetite is completely gone - even now and it is Thursday with my next shot scheduled for Saturday.

I have no gastric distress - don't feel nauseous - but just a complete lack of interest in food - as if it is literally too much effort to eat is the best way to describe it.

I am trying to maximize my protein. For example today I had a Slate Protein drink mixed in with my coffee and then forced  myself to have a Chobani 20 yogurt with some raspberries. For lunch I had 1/4 pound of sliced roast beef from the deli and a Build Bar which had 20 grams of protein.

It is now dinner and I just have no desire to eat

\-They **refuse** any vaccination, or to order any vaccination for patients. I asked for their input on how to get the flu vaccine here, and they told me not to get it because it is dangerous. ""Which formula or brand,"" I asked. ""All of them,"" they said. ""All vaccines are fake."" I still received a flu vaccine, nevertheless.

\-For the flu vaccine, they warned me afterwards that drinking coffee or eating meat will cause the vaccine to become more harmful, and so I should only have porridge for a week.

\-I later asked for their input on dealing with a sinus infection, as my laowai medicine is benadryl to dry out the running nose and to alleviate pressure in the face, plus orange juice with Sprite at meals. They said, benadryl's side-effects are too dangerous to risk taking, and fruit causes dampness (?) so avoid oranges while ill, as well. What they prescribed instead was some medicine which has severe side-effects relating to psychosis. I personally think that psychosis is slightly worse of a risk to take than ""maybe nose is too dry"" from benadryl?

\-After my sinus infection started, they chided me about how the flu vaccine is obviously useless since it did not prevent me from getting an unrelated illness, as if sinus infections are unusual for laowai in China. I was told that I should start trusting their medical expertise, because they know more than I do about medicine.

They are not a TCM practitioner, where I would expect such anti-science. They work at a real hospital which is allegedly the best in the city according to metrics that I do not understand.

This doctor is just so counter to medicine, from my perspective. When I lived in Mongolia, the English-speaking doctors at the one international hospital were all superb, in a country that is unarguably far worse to live in than China regarding medicine, quality of life, state of affairs, etc. When I lived in Vietnam, similarly worse than China as with Mongolia, their English-speaking doctors also were very competent and thorough.

I've been working at my job for a year and a half. Its a casual corporate café. We are a small staff about 5 of us. I work as the Barista/Cashier. From like 7-10:30 I'm at the coffee station. Then during lunch I man the register. My manager is supposed to be working the coffee station while I'm on the register during lunch, but that doesn't happen at ALL. Whenever it gets busy hes NEVER in the front and is usually in the office doing idk what. So I'm forced to go back and forth. We aren't always busy,  but there are times when we are REALLY busy. My manager STILL is nowhere to be found.  After lunch at around 1 we all get to go on break. Now when I first started I did ask my manager how breaks work and he told me we all go on break at 1. Well fast forward to one day I'm on break and there's like 2 people waiting at the coffee station. Now seeing as though I'm clocked out Im not going to get up. Later on the chef tells me that I don't need to clock out and I'm on what he calls a ""working lunch"" which to me is BS because my manager used to eat lunch with us and most of the times he's get up and help people,  but now he no longer eats with us so I have to get up and make coffee for people. Now I don't always mind doing it, but I'm not going to continue to do it if I'm not getting paid to do it. My breaks are unpaid,  so if I don't clock out for my break shouldn't that mean that I should have OT? Im SO confused as to how that even works?

We’ve been building something together for 8-9 months now and we had our ups and downs during this period but for the last couple of weeks i started to develop a utterly strong feeling of hate towards her. We spend most of our time together and our dates usually imply getting coffee together, going to the theater, eating out and whatever bullshit you can do in your 20’s with your partner. The point is we spend a lot of our time with each other giving the fact that we’re in the same university (this is where we met, we are both dental students). The hate feeling started a couple of weeks ago as mentioned before and now it’s just a mix of wanting to harm her constantly both emotionally and physically (i’ve never laid hands on her and *never will* but it’s very weird and scary even for me the way i’m feeling right now). 
She did absolutely nothing wrong and she treats me the best way she can. I feel guilty for my own emotions but i just can’t help it. I cannot look into her eyes without having that disgusted look on my face and repeating myself that i hate her in the back of my head. I’m conscious enough to not ever hurt her physically but sometimes i have these urges that i can’t explain. 

I’m questioning whether i should wait until this feeling goes away and i start loving her back the same way i did in the beginning or do i break up with her now? 

I’m seeking to get licensed psychiatric advice soon but any kind of opinion from people who went through the same experience and process is appreciated. ** 

UPDATE: 

I’m using text to speech so in this text might be some misspelling and some issues. I’ve been trying to understand. Where am I going with this relationship and how am I going to approach it in the future. I spend more time with my girlfriend, we have now a more sensitive and emotional part in our relationship. I tried to understand her feelings, and I’ve been opening up to her more and more throughout this week. Also, we took a mini vacation in which we did a lot of communication. We did a lot of fun stuff together and we went out with a couple of friends and after that I feel like things are going better between us. also, I tried, including more fun in our activities such as going karting and hiking. I love her a lot. Things are going better between us and that would be the overall position of our relationship for now.

1pehu0e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pehu0e,Question about Xbox mods for players (From Modder),"Hello everyone. My name is PanKotan, and I've been making mods for Stalker 2 for a year now.

You can find all them [here](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Kotelok911/mods)

I've already made over 10 mods, all of which you can see in the screenshots (Winter, Dead Zone, Clear Sky, etc.). However, they're all only available for PC, as porting mods to Xbox is a slightly more complex process and takes longer.

And as many may have noticed... Mods on Xbox have certain difficulties. There are 10 times fewer of them than on PC.

I make mods for fun, and they don't generate profit (However, I want to thank everyone who supported me on  BuyMeaCoffee!)

And the more mods you make, the more weight you gain for the future. I've already allocated a separate 1TB drive exclusively for mods, because if I delete them, I won't be able to adapt them to new patches.

10 mods, 2 platforms (Steam and Nexus) = I need to constantly maintain 20 mods. Every patch breaks something, and I have to fix it.

Now I get asked almost daily to port mods to Xbox, but for me, that means literally redoing all the work I've already done—all over again, but adding 10 more mods. And it's also a responsibility—I'll have to monitor bugs there. Instead of being an enthusiast, I'll turn into an unpaid technical consultant.

So, since I've accumulated a decent number of mods, I'm thinking maybe I should start some kind of crowdfunding campaign. For porting and future support of mods to Xbox. That way, I can at least recoup some of the time I've spent. So, would console owners be interested in taking part in this?

Thank you for your attention! This is not a call to action, I'm just interested in your opinion :)",15,1764897541.0,stalker,5,0.9,False

I’m new to at-home espresso and recently got a Gaggia Evo Pro with a DF54 grinder as an early Christmas gift. I’ve been struggling to dial it in. I’m currently using 19 grams of coffee, but my grind setting either produces a shot that chokes or sprays everywhere. Regardless, the shot always tastes awful…

My puck prep process is: bottomless portafilter, distribute the grounds, level, and tamp using a spring-loaded tamper. The coffee beans I’m using are Stumptown medium roast.",3,1764897508.0,gaggiaclassic,3,1.0,False

I’m on the hunt for someone who’s effortlessly cool, totally chill, and maybe just the right amount of weird.  I’m looking for a connection that feels natural, fun, and maybe a little unpredictable in the best way possible.

I’m the kind of person who jumps into random hobbies with zero hesitation, just to see what sparks joy. One month I’m teaching myself guitar riffs, the next I’m deep into brewing kombucha or trying to master origami (spoiler: my paper cranes look more like paper blobs). I pick things up fast, but I’ll admit I’m prone to getting sidetracked by the next shiny interest that catches my eye. It’s a chaotic process, but it keeps life exciting.

If you’re the kind of person who loves learning random skills, trading playful roasts with a side of affection, or just vibing over something hilariously dumb or niche internet memes, we’d probably get along. Let’s grab a coffee, swap stories about our weirdest hobbies, or just see where the conversation takes us.

1pehqnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1pehqnl/stop_with_the_aerocano/,stop with the “aerocano”,"steaming an iced americano is like asking for cold foam on a hot drink. it’s useless. 

you’re making a watered down coffee into an EVEN MORE watered down coffee by melting the ice. if you want your espresso frothy just throw it in a shaker!!!!! 

thanks, now i have to deal with customers asking for this new trendy beverage 😍 it’s already bad enough with the iced cappuccino requests smh ",0,1764897286.0,barista,29,0.5,False
