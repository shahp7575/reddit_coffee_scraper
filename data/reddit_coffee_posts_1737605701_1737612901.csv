My spouse and I have owned our home for over 3 years, bought for $365k with a 3.5% interest rate. We live in a metro and our mortgage payment/taxes have been steadily increasing in those 4 years. It was $2100 the first year and is now up to $2500. Less than a year into owning our home, my partner got severely injured and was out of work for 6 months. Due to me being unable to work full time because I had to care for him and the kids, we racked up about $80k in debt between car loans, credit cards and personal loans. We also did a forbearance through our mortgage company so we wouldn‚Äôt lose our house. We don‚Äôt have any family or really any support system where we live. 

We are both self-employed and I bartend here and there when I‚Äôm able too. Our take home this past year was $95k. We own a plumbing business and our numbers have doubled since we opened in 2023 but am not counting on that happening again this year (I hope it does, but not banking on it).  We don‚Äôt have any sort of savings or investments and we live check to check or job to job as the pay varies greatly week by week. We have fallen behind on our mortgage multiple times over the last couple of years and I honestly just feel like I am drowning. We are currently almost 2 months behind and I am constantly trying to catch up on the mortgage. I calculated how much we are paying toward what each month and it is as follows:

-mortgage/utilities/phone, etc.-$3600
-insurances (car/health)-$600
-credit cards/loans/car payment-$3500

I try to put aside $700/month for taxes for our businesses as well. We have cut back greatly on any spending we don‚Äôt need to do such as coffee, eating out, etc. 

All that being said, we could sell our home for about $515k and would make at least $100k off of the sale. I feel like the odds of us getting a heloc or anything of that sort are slim with the spotty payment and credit history. It is looking more and more tempting to sell our home, pay off all the debt and actually have an emergency fund and be able to contribute to our IRAs and kids savings accounts. Rentals are around the same we are paying now for our mortgage ($2200-$2600 for a 3-4bed house).

I know we have an amazing interest rate, but I just cannot see a way out of this and the only thing bringing me peace is the idea of selling our house. Would love any input. Thanks for reading. ",1,1737611285.0,FinancialPlanning,3,1.0,False

But have you ever wondered what would happen to your body if you gave it up completely? No more cookies, sodas, candies, or even that sneaky spoonful of sugar in your coffee. It sounds terrifying at first, but the results might just be sweet enough to convince you to give it a try. Let‚Äôs take a fun, week-by-week look at how your body reacts to living without added sugar for 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and even 1 year. Spoiler alert: you might never want to go back!

# [1 Week Without Sugar](https://medhouse.info/en/quit-sugar/): The Tough Start

Welcome to the sugar detox! The first week is often the hardest. Why? Your body is addicted to sugar, and it‚Äôs not going to let go without a fight. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening:

* **Day 1-3:**¬†You might feel tired, cranky, and perhaps even a little foggy-headed. This is your brain throwing a tantrum because it‚Äôs not getting its regular dose of sweetness.
* **By Day 5:**¬†Cravings start to subside. You‚Äôll notice your energy stabilizing throughout the day without the sugar highs and crashes.
* **Benefits:**¬†Improved focus, less bloating, and better digestion. Your body is already thanking you!

Fun Fact: Sugar activates the same brain pathways as drugs like cocaine. No wonder it‚Äôs hard to quit!

# 2 Weeks Without Sugar: The Breakthrough

Congratulations! You‚Äôve survived the hardest part. At the two-week mark, some real changes start happening:

* **Clearer Skin:**¬†Bye-bye breakouts! Without sugar causing inflammation, your skin begins to glow.
* **More Energy:**¬†Instead of sugar spikes, your energy is steady and reliable. You might even notice you‚Äôre waking up feeling refreshed.
* **Reduced Cravings:**¬†Sugary treats don‚Äôt seem as tempting anymore. In fact, an apple might taste just as sweet‚Ä¶ weird, right?
* **Mood Boost:**¬†Those emotional swings caused by sugar crashes? Gone. Hello, happy you!

Pro Tip: If you‚Äôre still struggling, load up on naturally sweet foods like berries and sweet potatoes to curb cravings.

# 1 Month Without Sugar: A New You

After one month, the benefits are undeniable. You‚Äôve officially kicked the sugar habit, and your body is thriving. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on:

* **Weight Loss:**¬†Cutting out sugar often means cutting out empty calories. Without even trying, you might find your pants fitting looser.
* **Better Sleep:**¬†No more tossing and turning at night. Your stable blood sugar levels help regulate your sleep cycle.
* **Improved Heart Health:**¬†With less sugar, your triglyceride levels drop, reducing your risk of heart disease.
* **Stronger Immune System:**¬†Sugar suppresses your immune system, so without it, your body can fight off colds and infections more effectively.

Fun Fact: Sugar feeds the bad bacteria in your gut. Without it, your gut microbiome starts to heal, improving digestion and overall health.

# 3 Months Without Sugar: Transformation Mode

By now, quitting sugar is no longer a struggle. It‚Äôs your new normal, and your body is LOVING it:

* **Sharper Mind:**¬†Studies show that cutting sugar can improve memory and cognitive function. Your brain fog is a thing of the past.
* **Better Metabolism:**¬†Your body‚Äôs insulin sensitivity improves, making it easier to process carbs and fats efficiently.
* **Fewer Aches and Pains:**¬†Less sugar means less inflammation, which can alleviate joint pain and chronic conditions.
* **Healthier Skin:**¬†Your collagen production gets a boost, reducing wrinkles and keeping your skin youthful.

Pro Tip: At this point, it‚Äôs safe to reintroduce occasional natural sugars like honey or maple syrup if you crave something sweet‚Äîin moderation, of course.

# 1 Year Without Sugar: A Life-Changing Decision

Quit Sugar You‚Äôve done it. An entire year without sugar. What‚Äôs changed?

* **Weight Management:**¬†Your weight has likely stabilized at a healthy level. Plus, your body composition has improved, with more muscle and less fat.
* **Disease Prevention:**¬†Your risk of type 2¬†[diabetes](https://medhouse.info/en/how-to-reduce-the-risk-of-diabetes/), heart disease, and even certain cancers is significantly lower.
* **Enhanced Taste Buds:**¬†Food tastes better. You‚Äôll be shocked at how sweet fruits like bananas and strawberries are now.
* **Longevity:**¬†Without sugar aging your cells, you‚Äôre setting yourself up for a longer, healthier life.

Fun Fact: Many people report feeling 10 years younger after a year of living sugar-free. Who needs a time machine when you can just quit sugar?

# The Global Sugar Problem: Stats from the U.S. and Europe

Did you know that the average American consumes about¬†**17 teaspoons of added sugar per day**? That‚Äôs nearly¬†**57 pounds of sugar annually**, far exceeding the American Heart Association‚Äôs recommended limit of¬†**6 teaspoons for women**¬†and¬†**9 teaspoons for men**¬†per day. This overconsumption is linked to rising obesity rates, with approximately¬†**42% of adults in the U.S. classified as obese**.

In Europe, sugar consumption varies by country but is still a concern. For example, the average German consumes around¬†**103 grams of sugar daily**, while the average Brit consumes about¬†**93 grams per day**. Both figures exceed the World Health Organization‚Äôs recommended limit of¬†**50 grams per day**¬†(or about 12 teaspoons).

The impact of excessive sugar isn‚Äôt just personal; it‚Äôs societal. In the U.S., the annual healthcare cost associated with sugar-related conditions, such as¬†[type 2 diabetes](https://medhouse.info/en/symptoms-of-diabetes-what-you-need-to-know/)¬†and heart disease, is estimated at¬†**$1 trillion**. Similarly, in Europe, the economic burden of obesity‚Äîclosely tied to high sugar intake‚Äîis projected to reach¬†**‚Ç¨70 billion annually**.

But there‚Äôs good news! Studies show that even a¬†**10% reduction in sugar consumption**¬†could lead to significant improvements in public health and reduce healthcare costs dramatically. By choosing to go sugar-free, you‚Äôre not just benefiting yourself; you‚Äôre contributing to a healthier global trend.

# Bonus: The Emotional Transformation

It‚Äôs not just your physical health that benefits from ditching sugar. Your emotional well-being gets a major upgrade, too:

* **Confidence Boost:**¬†You‚Äôve accomplished something many people only dream of. That‚Äôs worth celebrating!
* **Positive Relationships:**¬†With fewer mood swings, you‚Äôre likely a better partner, friend, or parent.
* **Mindful Eating:**¬†You‚Äôve learned to listen to your body and give it what it truly needs, not just what it craves.

# Tips for Success

1. **Start Small:**¬†Don‚Äôt quit cold turkey. Gradually reduce sugar intake to avoid withdrawal symptoms.
2. **Read Labels:**¬†Sugar hides in unexpected places like bread, salad dressings, and sauces. Watch out!
3. **Find Alternatives:**¬†Use natural sweeteners like stevia or monk fruit when needed.
4. **Stay Hydrated:**¬†Sometimes cravings are just your body‚Äôs way of asking for water.
5. **Celebrate Wins:**¬†Treat yourself to non-food rewards like a massage or a new outfit.

I have also been researching on my own, I promise I'm not trying to be spoon fed information without even trying. I think local opinions are more valuable than anything when it comes to this, is all! :) 

I'm American (unfortunately) and looking to move via the DAFT do to some personal safety concerns I have. I've got this portion figured out mostly. However, I wanted to ask some cultural questions so I don't accidentally come across as a ""stupid American"". They really like to shelter us here, but I try. 

My only DAFT question is, if I brought my partner, can they go to school there? I tried to look it up and couldn't find a clear answer. 

I've heard (though maybe this isn't wholly universal) that people think Americans are loud, rude, overly friendly, etc. I don't think I fit the ""loud/rude"" portion as I'm a very introverted, quiet person by nature. However, I am very friendly. As in, smiling at strangers, giving passing compliments, small talk,  etc. Is this going be considered rude, invasive or anything? 

What are some rules, laws, etc that are kind of day to day things that might not be common knowledge to someone new? I've been reading up on the laws at large, of course but I mean the smaller things or even ""implied"" rules that may seem obvious. 

Lastly, I'm still searching for the right place to settle. I'd appreciate recommendations greatly! I'm 25, will be 26 by the time I move. I have a small dog. I'm not a ""party/clubbing"" person. I like coffee, museums, art, books, history, and ""nerdy"" things. Gaming, comic books, card games and the like.

1i7wdbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePieceSpoilers/comments/1i7wdbj/loki_and_rocks_are_the_joker/,Loki and Rocks are the Joker,"In this post I‚Äôll make the case that Loki and Rocks will both be revealed to have green hair and are both based on the Joker. I‚Äôll also be spitballing some possible implications from 1137.

First lets discuss the similarities between Loki and Rocks. Since there‚Äôs no L in Japanese, Loki‚Äôs name is pronounced Roki. Rocks‚Äôs name evokes the mythical giant bird called the Roc, as do Loki‚Äôs wing tattoos on his arms. Both characters were introduced through their destructive reputations, and both seem to have affinities for fire. They both also seem opposed to the World Government and Celestial Dragons. 

Now for the green hair, this was initially inspired by the possibility of Rocks being a Kurau D whose name was changed for his safety, with his persecution inspiring his ‚Äúreign of terror.‚Äù At the time, my line of thinking was that Rocks was short for shamrocks, tying to clover‚Äôs hair. This, combined with the theory that Rocks is Buggy‚Äôs dad (making both of Roger‚Äôs apprentices his enemy‚Äôs sons), opened up the possibility for Rocks to have had green hair and a clown motif, which of course would make him look like the Joker.

That reminded me of the theories about Mihawk and Shanks having a vampire v werewolf dynamic. If the Figarland family are associated with wolves, their enemies are associated with bats, which is also true for the Joker. This made me realize that Garling and Rocks making an unlikely alliance to beat Roger would be a complete inversion of Zoro and Sanji with Luffy, especially if their hair colors are also yellow and green. The other green/yellow rivalry in the series, Bart and Cavendish, also pairs a noble swordsman with a green haired, notoriously ruthless punk. 

Buggy and Crocodile are another unlikely alliance, and Crocodile has his own list of connections to Rocks. Firstly, theres a ‚Äúroc‚Äù in Croc, and secondly, the Egyptian crocodile headed god is named Sobek. My head-cannon for these connections has been that Rocks was the father of both Buggy and Crocodile, with Buggy‚Äôs mom being a Nefertari, and Crocodile‚Äôs mom being Shakky. Shakky‚Äôs age is an inversion of Crocodile‚Äôs (64, 46), and the theories about Mihawk being the son of Shakky and Rayleigh would make the Cross Guild leader‚Äôs half brothers. 

Here‚Äôs where it gets interesting.

I initially started to think Loki would have green hair because of his parallels to Zoro‚Äôs intro, as well as the fact that both him and Bartolomeo were restrained and seemingly spared by Shanks. This made me realize that Garling‚Äôs introduction was killing Donquixote Mjosgard, who had green hair, and also made an unlikely alliance with a blond (Otohime). Interestingly, Mjosgard‚Äôs cousin Doflamingo tried to recruit Crocodile and was soundly rejected, similar to Shamrock and Loki. Doflamingo is blond, especially cruel, and covers his eyes at all times. We have yet to see a clear image of Garling‚Äôs eyes in the present day. 

Doflamingo is called Joker and was allied with a drug dealing clown named after a Roman emperor, which feels like a mixing of the elements of Garling and Rocks. Their alliance was thwarted by two D clan members, reminiscent of Roger and Garp at God Valley. God Valley also had a group of little people (children) struggling to escape slavery and survive a death game, much like Dressrosa. Kuma‚Äôs healing abilities parallel Mansherry, who has blond hair with green flowers.

Loki laughs just like Doflamingo, they both (allegedly) killed their fathers, they both have a more chill older brother, and again, we haven‚Äôt seen their eyes and they like fire. 

Loki believes himself to be Nika, the sun god from the Harley texts. He has a friend named Shaggy that he talks to on the phone. As per my theory, Rocks had a relationship with Shakky.

To put it simply, I think Shaggy is Loki‚Äôs Harley. The name of the Harley religion could imply that it was left behind by a fanatic lover of one of the Nikas, similar to Yamato with Oden‚Äôs log book.

Here‚Äôs where it gets really interesting. The Joker is famous for his scar monologue, where he explains how he tried to protect his mother from his drunk father. We learn in 1137 that Harald removed his own horns, leaving scars on his own face. This raises the question, did Loki have horns, and did Harald remove them? If so, it would leave scars, giving us everything we need for a proper Joker parallel. 

Additionally, the theme of alcoholic parental abuse has been built up a lot and it seems appropriate for it to come to a head here. The hallucinogenic drink the giants drink is called GREEN fairy and they‚Äôre established to drink a lot. Doflamingo used alcohol to cope with his trauma and also abused children. Shanks seems great with kids but is also established to use alcohol to cope. Most of us are waiting for the other shoe to drop with Shanks and Harald, who seem deceptively beloved by the giants. Harald having an alcoholic side and abusing his son could provide that, and also be consistent with him seemingly cheating on his wife and abandoning his first son. 

Drinking seems relevant to the future power system, with Bonney‚Äôs extract based powers, green fairy‚Äôs reality warping, and the black liquid substance that seems to provide the powers of the Gorosei and the summoning circles. Coffee was mentioned on the page where the Gorosei teleported, and over-drinking was mentioned on the page where Shamrocks and Gunko teleported to the castle. Tea and coffee have been mentioned before and during betrayals multiple times, and the implication that the Gorosei‚Äôs planet themes may have originated with the Ancient Kingdom tell me that at some point the Gorosei as an institution likely switched sides. The first time we saw something like this was in Little Garden with Ms Golden Week, and the first thing Luffy said when forced to betray his crew was ‚Äúthe tea is good.‚Äù 

I think that Imu uses alcohol made from his own blood to enforce loyalty in his subjects, as a distorion of communion and the blood of Christ, and the sakazuki ritual. 

I‚Äôm not saying Imu used it on Harald to get him to betray Elbaf, and I‚Äôm also not necessarily saying that Imu is currently using it on Shanks to turn him into Shamrocks, but if that latter scenario WERE true, not only would there be ample foreshadowing for it, but it would also give Shanks a secret ultra rich identity, just like Batman. 

On the off chance that Gunko and Shaggy are different names for the same person, Doflamingo WAS in a relationship with a member of the enemy family, and Gunko‚Äôs devil tail and 2 toned eyes could easily be references to the Harlequin clown character and its roots in devil iconography.

I also wanna mention that Nico Robin going from Clover to Croc feeds into the DC stuff. Robin Joker etc etc.

Picture 2 Photo outside of cafe window looking North ,mmm might rain , went and got bike across the road  from under a tree  and parked it next to cafe window where I was sitting , got my wet weather gear out, and watched YouTube via cafes wifi .

 Picture 3 . Picture of  relocated Transalp outside cafe window , should be safer here , no tree straight above .üëç

Just came back from toilet , started to rain , wind really picked up , lightning strikes sounded , explosions and bangs could be heard .

Picture 4 ,5,6 Tree falls on my Beloved 750 Transalp .ü•µüò±üíî completely engulfing it ‚Ä¶my bike has gone .
Picture 7 ‚Ä¶.After Mooball staff kindly help me lift tree off bike and lift bike up ‚Ä¶.its a miracle ‚Ä¶a bloody miracle .
Only a broken mirror and a small dent in petrol tank and tiny tear in seat .
No scratches ,nothing else bent or broken .
It was with no doubt a mini tornado of sorts , that hit the Cafe and surrounding areas , when I left the roads in all directions had massive trees on the roads , that were being removed by the emergency services .
I believe the cafes hot water system may have exploded and they lost power.
Hopefully no one was injured or died in the tornado , which extended up to Gold Coast .

And, I'm a bit dissapointed.. I feel no difference.  It did not help my sleep, I don't feel any different than when I was drinking. 
And I really miss the ritual. I miss my daily cup of coffee.
But then I'm looking at your posts here and like wow. How the hell some people have the benefits and it changes their lives when I feel nothing.

Im a pretty thin person, I normally eat when I'm hungry or when I have time to sit and slowly eat a meal and I eat pretty healthy (I dont buy fast food) and I am very conscious of my sugar intake (I dont eat it often). 

I have a couple of jobs that require me to be on my feet like the whole time so I dont eat much when I'm on the clock. However these last few weeks have whooped my ass and I have been grabbing all kinds of sugary goodies and greasy fat food at all hours.

I've been reflecting and I realized I have not allowed myself time to get hungry this last week. I have been so gluttonous and am worried for my stomach. I am consuming food even though I know I'm full and I dont need more food. I feel so ashamed AND I look pregnant so I feel insecure.

I know its all due to stress and I should be more conscious of my actions than self deprecating but I am hoping that by venting it out I'll feel better.

I'll hopefully take a walk tomorrow to move out the food. 
Any recommendations (like a beverage such as coffee) to help speed along the digestive process to get back to my normal habits? 

I have been sleeping more so hopefully that also helps with how much im consuming as well as my mood.",1,1737608535.0,venting,1,0.99,False

1i7vxgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1i7vxgn/ugh_got_stood_up/,ugh got stood up," I've been talking to this guy for a month now over the phone , and facetimes. We will text sometimes but most of the time we'll get on the phone every other fews days or so (NOT everyday)! Anyways he's been wanting to see me but the holidays made it pretty hard so we finally both have some free time. He flew out to see me , oh we're in 2 different states btw! So he flew out to see me and he's here for a week.



First day his flight came in late so we didnt see each other. 2nd day (yesterday) he asked to see me and I told him of course. Once I got off work he called me and told me to just let him know once I start getting ready and that he'll look for something to do. So I'm waiting for him to reach back out to me so I know where we're going as that'll help me know how to dress. Didnt hear from him so I texted him asking how should I dress so i can get ready and he tells me dress casual.



I get ready , head there thinking we are going somewhere. Why did he take me to his hotel lobby. Sure it wasnt a bad environment , we had good conversation but it truly did not seem romantic nor thoughtful. He also put his hand on my thigh not high up or anything but I found it weird being our first time meeting. again great vibes other than that but a weird action for me.



Fast forward he asked if he could see me again the next day. Would I normally see someone back to back like this? No, but considering he is from out of town I figured only have a few days why not. Well we make plans to go to the bookstore its cozy with a coffee shop inside so the ambience is nice. We were supposed to meet at 7:30pm he calls me at 7:34pm to tell me he might not make it as he went out with his coworkers to go bowling and they went past the time he thought. He said they drove from the office in one car and he left his. Common sense to me means maybe not carpooling if you have plans later. And certainly not texing someone 4 minutes after the time they should meet (yes his job has an office in my city as well). I was so flabbergasted all I could say was ok calmly.



We have dinner reservations at this really fancy restaurant this weekend and I almost dont want to go. I like him but im so turned off I dont even know if I should waste my time. This has never happened to me, im a smart woman , pride myself in filtering out the bad eggs but maybe i clearly missed the mark.

I‚Äôm a college student who is staying in WGP (West Garfield Park) and noticed the lack of stores and 3rd spaces. Thinking of opening a coffee shop? And why aren‚Äôt there any in the first place? I‚Äôm posting this since I think it‚Äôs be best to ask the residents of the city if it‚Äôs a good idea in the first place.

1i7vxd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1i7vxd0/i_asked_chatgpt_to_write_rorys_book/,I asked chatgpt to write Rory‚Äôs book.,"Me- At the end of Gilmore girls a year in the life, Rory write the first three chapters of her book the Gilmore girls. Please write me a few paragraphs of this book. 

Chatgpt- Sure! Here's an imagined excerpt of how Rory's book, *The Gilmore Girls,* might start:

---

**Chapter One: The Lorelais**  

Stars Hollow is a town that defies definition. It's part small-town Americana, part surreal carnival, and part family. But for me, it‚Äôs always been home. My mother, Lorelai Gilmore, arrived here with me in tow when I was just a baby. She was nineteen, a single mom with a used car and enough willpower to split atoms. And from the moment we set foot in this town, we were a team.  

To know my mother is to know unpredictability. She‚Äôs equal parts brilliance and chaos. When I was six, she made me pancakes in the shape of dinosaurs because I had a fever and couldn't go on the field trip to the natural history museum. The pancakes were barely recognizable blobs, but she spent an hour narrating their prehistoric adventures as I ate. When I was twelve, she painted our living room yellow during a thunderstorm because ‚Äúit felt like the walls were too moody.‚Äù And when I was sixteen, she sat across from me in Luke‚Äôs diner, hands wrapped around her coffee mug, and told me she was proud of me in a way that made me feel like the world had stopped spinning for a moment.  

Our story isn‚Äôt a straight line. It‚Äôs a scribble, messy and imperfect. There were fights. There were tears. There was Dean, Jess, Logan, and‚Äîwell, let‚Äôs just say my love life has been as complicated as my mother‚Äôs coffee orders. But the thing about Lorelai and me is that we‚Äôve always found our way back to each other. Through disappointments and mistakes, through the chaos of life, she has been my constant.

What do you think? I can expand it or focus on a different part of their story!

Me- This is amazing!!!

Chatgpt- Thank you! I‚Äôm so glad you liked it! If you want me to dive into specific moments, like their life at the Dragonfly, Rory‚Äôs days at Chilton or Yale, or even the quirks of Stars Hollow, just let me know! I could write about these two forever.",0,1737608473.0,GilmoreGirls,11,0.38,False

**I [36F] met my Ex-husband [38M/F] (together 2 years; divorced for 5) at my friends Xmas Party. Now he wants to reconnect & I'm unsure**

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!victim blaming!<

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/pSjB2peCOz)  **Dec 27, 2017**

As the title states, I went to my best friends' Xmas/her husbands birthday party on the 24th and met my Ex there, for the first time since our divorce. Apparently he is one of my bff husbands' co-workers. He didn't know that I would be there and was as surprised as I was. We made some smalltalk and then I hopped over to Chat with another friend. During the evening we bumped into eachother a couple of times, he made some jokes, but most of the time I tried to avoid him. Yesterday my best friend sent me a screenshot in which my Ex asked her husband for my number (in case I wanted him to have it) because he wanted to ask me out.

Thing is, nobody in this city knows that we we're once married to each other. When I moved here 5 years ago from the other side of the country, I never mentioned my divorce. He didn't either. So now my friend & her husband want to hook us up, because""you seemed to have such great chemistry at the party"".


The other thing is that I never realised how much I missed him until he entered the room. Our relationship was a mistake, we got married because we were the only unmarried couple in our social circle and everybody else was already having babies. The divorce was ineviatable: our communication was rubbish, I wanted kids, he didn't (at least not as soon as possible), His mum was meddling and he didn't stand up to her.

At the same time we were really good friends and meeting him again made me more than happy. But I had a chat with my cousin (32F) and her husband who are spending Xmas & New Years Eve with me and they told me not to overreact and that being nostalgic for the things that could have been was natural during the holidays.

So now I am debating to meet him, talk to him and be done for good, but the risks of catching feelings again is high (He did look better than 5years ago & finally left his hometown to work for his dream business - something I told him to do years ago). Am I exaggerating/overreacting? What should I do???
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Met Ex-husband for the first time in 5 years. He lives in my city now and wants to take me out (His own words).  What TF should I do?

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/IOiFDfTqVh)  **Jan 16, 2018 (20 days later)**

*After posting I really wanted to answer your comments but I got distracted. But I read them, thought about them and applied some.This is what happened:*

Shortly after posting and before answering my best friends message, I ran into my Ex in the supermarket. We had a short talk, everything was collogial and since I did not want to jump to conclusions without talking to him, we went for coffee afterwards. Long story short: we agreed to stay in a friendly level, for our own good (He admitted that he felt extremly sentimental after meeting me the last time, I admitted feeling both giddy and panicky at the same time). He apologised for things he did/didn't do during our marriage (mainly not defending me against his mother, with whom he doesn't have any contact anymore). Then we discussed our friends.

What some people asked in my OP was why I never told my best friend about my (failed) marriage. The reasons is that she might be one of the kindest people I know, but she is quite religious (I'm not) and extremly against divorce. In her eyes you should better sacrifice your happiness for the benefit of the others, so getting a divorce is the cowards way out. It means you don't deserve love. Her MIL treats her like scum, her husband stays quiet because she ""is glad that (MiL) gave her the most important thing in her life"" and rather endures the rants and boundary-stomping. So telling her about my divorce would have resulted in one of two scenarios: a) she'd never talk to me again because I killed the idea of marriage or b) she'd try to get me back with my husband.

Some days ago, one of these scenarios happened. I told her before that I was not interested in giving Ex my number (I already had. Neither her or her husband, my Ex's friend knew.), because I was not looking for a relationship (I actually am not. Last March my last relationship kicked the bucket due to cheating (him) and unwillingness to forgive(me)). She acceptance that and inivited me for brunch the next Saturday (one of our traditions). Sunday comes and my Ex calls me whether I was going to bf's brunch. He got an inivitation. So we were both there, sitting next to each other, Bf and her husband trying their very best to get us interested in eachother. It was like in a very bad movie. Like that scene in ""When Harry met Sally"" when they go on a double date. Subtle remarks in the things we have in common, hints in compatablility, badly masked comments on my unsucessful love life... until BF's husband says: ""As far as I know [my name], she would probably make a great wife. My mom likes her, BF's mom loves her... she's every mothers dream."" And Ex says: ""Well, my mother used to call her That Woman and told me all her short-commings until I believed them. Actually she even admitted to hating her. But in hindsight she really was a great wife."" *Crickets* Ex and I look at eachother and burst out in laughter. Probably due to the pressure and the extreme awkwardness of the situation. BF and husband join in. For a moment they believe Ex made a joke. Then BF says: ""We are so sorry for pressuring you. It's just that we like you both and think you'd make a great couple!"" And Ex takes out his f**%'%ing phone shows them a picture of our wedding day (why the f was that there? Because he had sent me some pictures that my dear ExMIL withholded from me) and says: "" We did. But it did not work out and we're friends now. Who wants to go to the cinema?"" Chaos ensued. Worldviews broke. Bf started crying. BF's husband was flabberghasted. They make us leave to ""readjust"".

 Yesterday I spoke to Bf in the phone and explained everything thoroughly: the abuse by MIL, the arguments, the incompatibilities. The mutal decision to end it. My fear of telling her. She was silently crying for my future. Quote: ""You are already so old and threw away your only chance of happiness. No wonder you don't find love. You threw it away. It won't come back. Your future with Ex is riddled by betrayal, If you get back together, you can never mend what you tore apart. What will you tell any partner? I cannot understand how you could do that! You always seemed so compassionate, why could you not understand the pain of your MAIL.She lost her son to you. You did not respect her wishes and did not listen to her.I'm sure she loved you like a daughter but you were not ready."" That's when I said goodbye, have to go, see you and questioned my 5 year friendship. I talked to my mom, to my cousin and even to my Ex (who had a similar but not as emotional talk with BF's husband who doesn't even talk to him at work anymore.) They all recommend that I should give BF some space. I feel worse than after my last breakup.


Soooooo **tl;dr**: am friendly with my Ex now (planning to go to a Pub quiz next Friday with some other friends who have been told about our status), but my best friend is deeply sad about my inability to ""cherish marriage"", insulted me by siding with my abusive Ex MiL and is now in Time-out. Not sure how/whether to save this friendship. 

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**NDaveT**

>Your ""best friend"" is willing to choose her archaic, destructive views about divorce and marriage over your happiness. I don't think this friendship is worth saving.

**OOP**

>>It seems so. That's so frustrating, we disagreed in so much religionwise, but she was always acctepting/tolerant, just as I was. I never demonized her way of thinking, she never talked down mine-until now. Idk, maybe I'll just write her a nice letter, laying down my disappointment, offering her a chance to talk if she wants to and then slowly end things. Jeez, my divorce was easier.

**CloudOrigami**

>>>But would you¬†*really*¬†want to after the way she made you feel? She was really shitty to you over that phone call regardless of her views. Sorry this has happened to you OP, you deserve better than that -hugs-

**OOP**

>>>>Thanks.¬†*Hugs back*¬†you're right. I'll write a letter anyway, just to let it all out. Will cut contact and just hand her the letter if she confronts me. God, that feels like highschool all over again.

**Edit**: after reading all of your comments I decided to end the friendship. I did not sleep well, so I spent all night writing down what bothered me, so that, if she dares to talk to me again, I have the right arguments. Regarding her possible frustration/projection: I really acted as her therapist for the whole 5 years of our friendship and realize now how co-dependent and slightly toxic this relationship actually was. This is something I have to get over and though I'm a rather introverted social mess, I really need to look out for new friends who are not as prejudiced. (I told one of my colleagues the cliffsnote version of the conflict and she -divorced and remarried- told me to join her feminist knitting and sewing group, so yay, first step!)

Ex has a similar problem now, my friend's husband told their mutual friend group that Ex had ""loose morals"" and might be a bad influence. Because this is kindergarten, some of them blocked Ex on social media, some asked him what crime he commited and only one told him that a) BF's husband is extremly overreacting and b) He still wants to hang out with Ex no matter what. So we're now in the same ""find friends""-boat. 

My friend's husband actually asked his boss this morning if he could arrange it so that he did not have to share an office with Ex anymore. So yeah, they are also cutting ties. 

And to the comments asking which culture we/they belong to: we're all generic Europeans. Ex-friends are just belonging to a strange christian church (protestant. Not even catholic.)

**Tldr** Mission finding new friends is afoot. Ex-friends behave like toddlers, cementing my decision to severe contact.

1i7vwam,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackgirls/comments/1i7vwam/ughh_i_got_stood_up/,ughh. i got stood up," I've been talking to this guy for a month now over the phone , and facetimes. We will text sometimes but most of the time we'll get on the phone every other fews days or so (NOT everyday)! Anyways he's been wanting to see me but the holidays made it pretty hard so we finally both have some free time. He flew out to see me , oh we're in 2 different states btw! So he flew out to see me and he's here for a week.



First day his flight came in late so we didnt see each other. 2nd day (yesterday) he asked to see me and I told him of course. Once I got off work he called me and told me to just let him know once I start getting ready and that he'll look for something to do. So I'm waiting for him to reach back out to me so I know where we're going as that'll help me know how to dress. Didnt hear from him so I texted him asking how should I dress so i can get ready and he tells me dress casual.



I get ready , head there thinking we are going somewhere. Why did he take me to his hotel lobby. Sure it wasnt a bad environment , we had good conversation but it truly did not seem romantic nor thoughtful. He also put his hand on my thigh not high up or anything but I found it weird being our first time meeting. again great vibes other than that but a weird action for me.



Fast forward he asked if he could see me again the next day. Would I normally see someone back to back like this? No, but considering he is from out of town I figured only have a few days why not. Well we make plans to go to the bookstore its cozy with a coffee shop inside so the ambience is nice. We were supposed to meet at 7:30pm he calls me at 7:34pm to tell me he might not make it as he went out with his coworkers to go bowling and they went past the time he thought. He said they drove from the office in one car and he left his. Common sense to me means maybe not carpooling if you have plans later. And certainly not texing someone 4 minutes after the time they should meet (yes his job has an office in my city as well). I was so flabbergasted all I could say was ok calmly.



We have dinner reservations at this really fancy restaurant this weekend and I almost dont want to go. I like him but im so turned off I dont even know if I should waste my time. This has never happened to me, im a smart woman , pride myself in filtering out the bad eggs but maybe i clearly missed the mark. My sister said I should test it and possibly give one more chance to him with time limitations and boundaries but idk at this point. What should I do we've had amazing chemistry i almost feel bamboozled. Also how should i explain how disrespectful I feel no man has ever done this to me before",1,1737608379.0,blackgirls,4,0.67,False

I‚Äôm not here for advice or marriage tips‚ÄîI‚Äôve got therapy for that, thanks. This is just a cathartic rant about one of those weeks in marriage where everything snowballs into chaos over dumplings, carpool logistics, and‚Äîof course‚Äîmisunderstandings. If you‚Äôve ever asked yourself, ‚ÄúHow did we even get here?‚Äù while staring at a cold cup of coffee and rethinking all your life choices, welcome.

Friday: The Dumpling Debacle

It all started with dumplings. My husband, Alex, wanted dumplings for dinner. Perfect. I love dumplings. But when I suggested appetizers to go with them, the conversation turned into an argument faster than I could say ‚Äúsoy sauce.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm just going to eat the dumplings,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúOkay, so should I get something for myself?‚Äù

Apparently, trying to make sure I wasn‚Äôt left starving was enough to ruin the entire vibe. It escalated into accusations of ‚Äúmaking assumptions‚Äù and ‚Äúoverthinking.‚Äù By the time we actually ate, the dumplings were cold, and so was the mood. All I wanted was dinner‚Äînot a TED Talk on how I failed to read his mind.

Saturday: Coffee and Silent Tension

The next day, Alex suggested lunch at the mall. Optimistic, I thought, This is our chance to reset. No dumpling drama this time.

To keep it light, I suggested we grab coffee and take a slow walk to wake up. You know, something chill. But apparently, slow walks and Alex don‚Äôt mix. The coffee was lukewarm, the silence was ice cold, and by the time we finished our awkward stroll, lunch was scrapped.

I ended up crying in my room, questioning why I even try. Alex eventually came in to comfort me, apologizing for how ‚Äúdraining‚Äù it had been. I thought, Maybe he gets it. Maybe tomorrow will be better. Spoiler: it wasn‚Äôt.

Sunday: The San Jose Showdown

Sunday morning, Alex invited me out for lunch out of town. ‚ÄúNothing fancy, just food,‚Äù he said. What he didn‚Äôt say was, ‚ÄúI expect you to be up and ready by 9:30 a.m. sharp.‚Äù

At 9:30, I asked for 30 more minutes of sleep, thinking it was no big deal. Thirty minutes later, he‚Äôs pacing like we‚Äôre late for a flight to Paris. I scramble to get ready, we grab coffee, and then Alex decides it‚Äôs time to ‚Äútalk things out to avoid tension.‚Äù

Spoiler: talking did not avoid tension. Instead, it became, ‚ÄúBased on what you just said, here‚Äôs how you‚Äôve offended me.‚Äù By the time the coffee was cold, so were my hopes for a peaceful day. Lunch was canceled. Again.

Monday: The Voicemail

Monday was a holiday. A sacred day off for me, a middle school music teacher. (If you‚Äôve ever tried managing 30 tweens armed with recorders, you understand how precious my time off is.)

But instead of relaxing, I got a voicemail from Alex saying he felt ‚Äúabandoned‚Äù because I skipped our usual Sunday chat.

‚ÄúThis is unfair to me and to our relationship,‚Äù he said, with the conviction of someone writing a PhD thesis on my shortcomings.

Meanwhile, I‚Äôd spent the last two weeks being his hype woman‚Äîcooking, cleaning, and keeping things calm so he could focus on work. My own demanding two weeks were about to start, but apparently, I‚Äôm the villain for needing one day to myself.

Tuesday: Mystery Carpool

Tuesday morning, Alex didn‚Äôt go to work. Did he tell me? Nope. So when it‚Äôs time to carpool home‚Äîsomething we do every day‚ÄîI‚Äôm standing there like a fool, wondering where he is. Turns out, he stayed home and forgot to mention it.

Is this a marriage or an escape room? Because I‚Äôm constantly trying to solve puzzles here.

Wednesday: Telepathic Carpooling

Wednesday, I text Alex to confirm our carpool plans, letting him know I‚Äôd ride home with him and needed the car for a haircut afterward. Somehow, he misreads the text, assumes I‚Äôm riding with someone else, and leaves without me.

When he realizes his mistake, he turns around and says, ‚ÄúNext time, you don‚Äôt need to tell me about carpooling. I already know.‚Äù

Oh, really? Because yesterday, I didn‚Äôt know. But sure, let me just work on perfecting my telepathy skills.

The Bigger Picture

Six days. Six ridiculous, exhausting days that perfectly sum up why I‚Äôm running on fumes.

Every time I try to express my needs, it becomes an argument. I‚Äôm either offensive, misunderstood, or accused of ‚Äústonewalling.‚Äù Meanwhile, I‚Äôm constantly bending over backward to keep this ship afloat, only to feel like it‚Äôs sinking anyway.

And when I finally withdraw to take care of myself, I‚Äôm the bad guy. What about me? I feel abandoned every day‚Äîleft to juggle his emotions while mine take a back seat.

What‚Äôs the Point?

At this point, I‚Äôm starting to wonder if marriage is supposed to feel like an unpaid internship in emotional labor. Am I crazy for wanting something calmer? Something where I don‚Äôt have to decode every conversation like it‚Äôs a CIA memo?

Honestly, I don‚Äôt have any answers. I just needed to vent. If you‚Äôve made it this far, thanks for coming to my TED Talk on ‚ÄúSix Days of Chaos and Counting.",1,1737608143.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

I'm so sorry for any confusion, and thank you u/The_Truthkeeper for catching that.

Not even sure if this belongs in this subreddit, but I hope this is a satisfying read.

This happened back in 2018 when I (27F) worked at this *god-awful* call center for one of the many phone service providers, and that's about as much as I can say about that place. Fuck that place, on ***GOD***. My supervisor at the time was cool though, he gets a pass.

This was at a time where I was at my lowest. I was depressed, had zero motivation, and the only reason I was ever actually going into work was half because my body was running on auto-pilot, and half because I liked the routine. It gave me something to work with, therefore my brain had enough to be distracted from the torment that built in my mind.

One day, I got a call from a customer who wanted a credit on a late fee. When I would get these calls, I would usually give them a credit regardless of the amount. Times are hard, yk? Why am I gonna make somebody struggle when I can easily help them over $5?

This time, though, holy *shit*.

I'm sitting at my cubicle, waiting for a call on a slow day, when this piece of work calls.

**Me:** Thank you for calling \[insert place I work\], this is doesnotexist9, may I have--

**Dude:** About DAMNED time, I was on hold for almost two hours! (this was a lie, everyone in this shift had a 10-ish minute break between calls. It was *slow*.)

**Me, obviously wanting to be nice:** Oh, I'm so sorry about that! Let me take your name, and your pin so I can help assist you faster.

**Dude:** \[scoffs\] Isn't my information already on the screen? Why do I need to repeat it?

**Me:** This is purely for verification purposes, sir. I need to verify you so I can access the account.

**Dude:** I already went through that with the automated voice! Why do I need to do it again!

**Me:** Sir. I don't know your name. I need to verify you.

This goes on for fifteen minutes, I shit you not. I don't even know how I managed to keep my cool at the time, as I seem to have anger issues now! Eventually, he gives me his information and I see the balance he owes at the top of the screen. $3000. I think, maybe he called to make the payment. So the call proceeds as such.

**Me:** Okay sir, now that we have your account verified, how can I help you?

**Dude:** Yeah, I need a credit made to the account.

**Me:** ...for how much?

**Dude:** $3000.

I put myself on mute at this point, for a few seconds only. I start bracing myself to get yelled at because I'm about to tell him that even if I was able to give him the credit, I could only give him a credit for $1499.99. I unmute myself, and tell him that I'd be happy to look into his issue and that I would need to look at his previous bills for further investigation. He doesn't sound too pleased with that, but doesn't say much after that.

I'm scrolling through this dude's past bills, and I come to the conclusion that the balance on the account is purely in late fees. $3000 in fucking ***LATE FEES***. I don't remember from when they started or when the call happened, but I do remember thinking, just how the fuck do you let this happen?? And how does this dude have service up still??

Taking a deep breath, I go back and talk to him.

**Me:** Okay sir, I looked into things on my end, and I unfortunately can't give you that credit.

**Dude:** What? Why the fuck not?

**Me:** Because the balance on your account is all due to late fees. Plus, even if I wanted to, this is beyond the amount we're allowed to give.

Then he just starts screaming at me, going on a rant about how I'm incompetent, how I suck at my job, and how I can't do the one thing he called for me to do. I'm ignoring him, sipping at my Irish coffee (this job sucked, I needed it :) ) when he drops this absolute banger of a line.

**Dude:** I'm gonna find you, and I'm gonna kashoot you straight in the fucking head.

Keep in mind, he had no idea where he called to. I, on the other hand, had his home address right in front of me. He lived states away, so I had nothing to worry about. I had half a mind to read it out to him so he knew he had no power over me. On the other hand, this was probably the lowest point in my life. I had nothing to live for at that moment. I possibly have gone farther than rock bottom, and I felt nothing anymore.

So without missing a beat, I talk.

**Me:** Sir, you'd actually be doing me a favor. Now are you gonna pay in credit or in debit?

It's silent for a full minute. I'm simply waiting for a response. I start to think maybe he hung up, when he finally speaks.

**Dude:** Credit. Let me get my card.

So I take his number, he makes the payment, and I end the call with a cheery ""And thank you so much for calling \[place of work\] I hope you have a wonderful rest of your night!"" when he hangs up.

My supervisor pulls me into an office the next day and asks if I'm alright. I'm confused for a sec before I remember that people actually listen to our calls. He was notified by the person doing my audit, and I was almost sent to a therapist. I ended up declining, as I didn't have the right insurance for a good one at the time.

I don't regret telling him that. I hope he learned his lesson about talking to call center representatives :)",288,1737607950.0,MaliciousCompliance,25,0.91,False

---
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Talk About the Goldilocks Zone of Logo Animations!‚Äù

Picture this: you‚Äôre watching a video, and the logo animation starts. It‚Äôs sleek, smooth, and captivating‚Ä¶ for about five seconds. Then it drags on like a relative telling you every detail about their weekend. Suddenly, you're screaming internally, ""Get to the content already!""

Logo animations are like punchlines: they need to land quickly, leave an impression, and not overstay their welcome.


‚ÄúIs Your Logo Animation a Mic Drop or a Marathon?‚Äù

Here‚Äôs the deal: a motion logo animation should be 3‚Äì5 seconds. That‚Äôs it. Why? Because no one is binge-watching your intro. They‚Äôre here for the story, the ad, or the content behind it.

If your animation is longer than five seconds, you might as well hand your audience a pillow and some chamomile tea.

Keep it snappy! Make it memorable. Think of the swoosh sound in Nike‚Äôs ads or Pixar‚Äôs hopping lamp‚Äîsimple, iconic, done.


‚ÄúAttention Spans Are Shorter Than Your Coffee Break‚Äù]

Let‚Äôs get real: studies show our attention spans are now shorter than a goldfish‚Äôs. (No offense, Nemo.) So, if you think viewers will sit through 10 seconds of your logo twirling like a ballerina, think again.

Three seconds is your sweet spot to say, ‚ÄúHey, this is us! We‚Äôre awesome!‚Äù and then move on.


---

‚ÄúWhen Logo Animations Go Wrong‚Ä¶‚Äù]

You‚Äôve seen them. The logo fades in‚Ä¶ spins‚Ä¶ glows‚Ä¶ explodes‚Ä¶ reforms‚Ä¶ then, finally, the video starts. By this point, the audience is like, ‚ÄúDo I need to submit a r√©sum√© just to watch this?‚Äù

Don‚Äôt be that brand. A logo animation should be like a high-five, not a wedding speech.


---

 ‚ÄúHow to Nail the Perfect Motion Logo‚Äù]

1. Keep It Simple: A clean animation with a clear message is way more effective than a fireworks display.


2. Be On-Brand: Make sure the animation reflects your vibe. Is your brand fun? Sleek? Edgy? Let the animation speak your brand‚Äôs language.


3. Test It on Friends: Show it to someone who‚Äôs brutally honest. If they sigh or roll their eyes, back to the drawing 

‚ÄúYour Audience Deserves a Quick Hello, Not a TED Talk‚Äù]

Remember, your motion logo is the appetizer, not the main course. It‚Äôs there to set the tone, not hog the spotlight. So, keep it short, sweet, and unforgettable.

Now go create an animation that wows in three seconds flat‚Äîand maybe leaves them wanting just a little more. Just not too much more.

Side note: I made the mistake of posting this initially in the r/carnivalcruisefans sub which elicited some downvotes and some triggered comments pretty quick ü§£ those people seem to have gotten offended. I'm just a blunt person ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 

## The good:
- price was pretty good (now I know why)
- food was decent in dining room at night
- Chef's table was great
- Nick and Nora's Steakhouse was good
- staff was amazing and friendly
- Veranda deck accommodations with larger balcony was perfect for two
- entertainment was decent
- some cool folks of the older generation, very polite and knowledgeable happy to share info with noobs like us

- prunes at breakfast ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 

## The bad:
- holy f, they sell a 15 drink a day package, besides enabling alcoholism for the two days at sea I saw people trying to drink every damn one of them. I get there's not much to do but damn. So many drunks acting like fools, crowding hot tubs, pools, arguing, yelling, and flailing about. One drunk dude in the dining room almost hit me in the face doing God knows what. The security guy saw me and gave me a knowing look. I think he'd have looked away if I laid the guy out. They literally don't cut people off! We showed up to the piano bar and it was nice and quiet. Minutes later a drunk chick and her friends showed up, sat behind us and proceeded to scream in our ears and yell requests for songs while dude was trying to play.

- really drunk dude tried to talk to the comedian as he performed but was so drunk it was unintelligible. The great part was that the comedian just rolled with it and made fun of the guy until he looked like he would cry so the sadistic side of me got a kick out of that. That actually happened two different nights with two different comedians. 

- so many nasty people literally open mouth coughing on the ship everywhere. My wife and I got off the boat and had the flu manifest within hours.....

- no slight here to the handicap, but there are dozens of people zipping around on mobility scooters like all the time at max speed and I got clipped on the Lido deck. Lady didn't even notice WTH

- the buffet Lido deck food was not great. For lunch I was living off the salad bar; not a lot of healthy items for lunch.

- the coffee makers almost never worked so the one or two that did were swamped by folks

- the scrambled eggs were like not eggs

- so much pork; if you're kosher or halal you're basically going to have to vegan out and even then you're really screwed at lunch

- basketball court on sun deck but only soccer balls to play with ü§£

- the down draft from the engine exhaust is gonna get you (that's prob normal on most cruises I'm guessing though so not really on Carnival)

- constant sewage smell in certain areas (mainly near the fun shops)

- the second hand cigarettes from the casino deck can be enjoyed the full length of that deck and at least on two additional decks wafting up the stair wells if you enjoy unwelcome bouts of asthma 

Anyways yeah we won't be doing that again. 

Any recommendations for our next line?

General info you may be curious about:
- Upstate NY/Vermont, still working on the land.
- Heating is radiant floor primarily, wood furnace in living room is more for vibes than effective heating.
- A/C would be probably some level of mini split configuration. Still determining how much would be needed for conditions.
- A frame dimensions can be difficult to convey, because the last few feet to the wall are low and largely unusable, so all dimensions begin when the pitched ceiling becomes 5 feet off the ground (i.e. usable space). Hopefully that makes sense.

Some maybe not obvious design considerations:
- All water supply requirements on the first floor are adjacent to the utility room to the max extent. Primary bathroom bathtub would fill from the ceiling.
- The range hood is against the utility room to allow for a remote and thus quieter fan it that room.
- Combined laundry and utility will be as soundproofed as is reasonable and contain most of the noisy devices in the house.
- No door to primary closet because the pitch of the roof would require a pocket door and I hate pocket doors.
- Because wall space is lacking in an a frame, there will be a built in bookcase shelving behind the stairs, see pictures.
- Built in under stairs cabinetry, see pictures. I would like be a bar or coffee spot.
- I am considering some kind of murphy bed for the guest room to dual purpose that room as an office too, but I think it‚Äôs reaching and I can‚Äôt yet figure it out.
- The thought with the primary bathroom door is to inherently provide privacy to the toilet when opened.
- The entrance hall is centered on the structure at large for symmetry.

Known limitations, these are currently accepted negatives, would love ideas to mitigate if possible.
- Combined laundry+utilities and pantry sucks. I can't figure out an another place for the pantry that makes more sense. It could go under the stairs but i really like the idea of a little bar or coffee area there.
- The guest bathroom is upstairs. Again sucks but I'm having difficulty justifying 2.5 baths in this sqft.
- A ""window wall"" on the dining/living wall is inefficient, but the natural light and view is worth it in my head.
- The kitchen work and storage space is limited but I always had a small kitchen and kind of prefer it. The microwave would be built into the island.

The vibes I‚Äôm going for are practical and cozy. Sorry that a lot of words, but i‚Äôm sure some of you appreciate thorough. Would love any and all feedback!",11,1737606542.0,floorplan,10,1.0,False

I've been talking to this guy for a month now over the phone , and facetimes. We will text sometimes but most of the time we'll get on the phone every other fews days or so (NOT everyday)! Anyways he's been wanting to see me but the holidays made it pretty hard so we finally both have some free time. He flew out to see me , oh we're in 2 different states btw! So he flew out to see me and he's here for a week.

First day his flight came in late so we didnt see each other. 2nd day (yesterday) he asked to see me and I told him of course. Once I got off work he called me and told me to just let him know once I start getting ready and that he'll look for something to do. So I'm waiting for him to reach back out to me so I know where we're going as that'll help me know how to dress. Didnt hear from him so I texted him asking how should I dress so i can get ready and he tells me dress casual.

  
I get ready , head there thinking we are going somewhere. Why did he take me to his hotel lobby. Sure it wasnt a bad environment , we had good conversation but it truly did not seem romantic nor thoughtful. He also put his hand on my thigh not high up or anything but I found it weird being our first time meeting. again great vibes other than that but a weird action for me.

  
Fast forward he asked if he could see me again the next day. Would I normally see someone back to back like this? No, but considering he is from out of town I figured only have a few days why not. Well we make plans to go to the bookstore its cozy with a coffee shop inside so the ambience is nice. We were supposed to meet at 7:30pm he calls me at 7:34pm to tell me he might not make it as he went out with his coworkers to go bowling and they went past the time he thought. He said they drove from the office in one car and he left his. Common sense to me means maybe not carpooling if you have plans later. And certainly not texing someone 4 minutes after the time they should meet (yes his job has an office in my city as well). I was so flabbergasted all I could say was ok calmly.

  
We have dinner reservations at this really fancy restaurant this weekend and I almost dont want to go. I like him but im so turned off I dont even know if I should waste my time. This has never happened to me, im a smart woman , pride myself in filtering out the bad eggs but maybe i clearly missed the mark. My sister said I should test it and possibly give one more chance to him with time limitations and boundaries but idk at this point. What should I do we've had amazing chemistry i almost feel bamboozled.

I‚Äôve let him know in the past it bothers me. It‚Äôs embarrassing to me when we go to a coffee shop, fast food restaurant or the grocery store and have separate orders.

1i7v5jd,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i7v5jd/age_of_demina_system_crash_and_reboot_chapter_13/,[Age of Demina! - System Crash and Reboot!] Chapter 1.3 | Neural Fusion-HAAA!,"""Reroute power to Sub-Node 3!"" Kali's voice carried across the room, her usual playful demeanor replaced by steel-edged authority. ""We need to shut down the West Wing servers. Now!""

Jin-woo coordinated with his senior engineers, sweat beading on his brow despite the supposedly climate-controlled environment. His mind spun through the potential ramifications of their failure. Banking systems could collapse. Power grids might go dark. Hospital networks could flatline. His creation, his pride and joy, had the potential to become a digital plague that could bring modern civilization to its knees.

""Dr. Park!"" Michael's voice snapped him back to the immediate crisis. ""The isolation protocols, they're not holding. The code... it's adapting faster than we can contain it.""

Jin-woo stared at his screen, watching as his life's work transformed into a monster before his eyes. The elegant algorithms he'd crafted with such care now twisted and mutated like a virus, growing stronger with each failed attempt to contain it. His gut instinct from that morning hadn't just been warning him about a potential threat, it had been screaming about an apocalypse of his own making.

The stifling air in the facility grew thicker with each passing second, the climate control system struggling against the heat generated by overworking servers and panicked bodies. Jin-woo's shirt clung to his back as he raced between workstations, the fabric a constant reminder of how quickly their orderly world had descended into chaos.

""Containment breach in Sector 7!"" Jennifer shouted across the large room. ""The firewall's failing!"" Her voice carried over the cacophony of alarms and shouting technicians.

Around him, screens flickered with an almost organic rhythm, as if the rogue code had developed its own heartbeat. The numbers continued their merciless countdown, each tick bringing them closer to what Jin-woo had begun to think of as digital doomsday. His creation, meant to revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence, now threatened to tear it apart from the inside out.

""Pull the emergency protocols for the backup servers,"" His voice had become hoarse from shouting over the sirens. ""And someone please shut off that damn alarm before we all go deaf!""

The red warning lights continued their strobe-like dance across walls and faces, transforming familiar colleagues into strange, shadow-haunted versions of themselves. Jin-woo, in those crimson flashes, caught glimpses of fear he'd never seen before, not just concern over a failed project, but real, primal terror at what they might have unleashed. They all knew fully well what a rogue AI as powerful as Demina could do. The catastrophe it would become if they failed to stop it today.

""Dr. Park,"" Michael called. His tie now completely undone and hanging like a surrender flag around his neck. ""The system's starting to affect external networks. We're getting reports of anomalies in connected facilities.""

The words hit Jin-woo like a physical blow. His mind raced through the interconnected web of systems that relied on their core processing, hospitals monitoring patient data, power plants managing energy distribution, financial institutions handling millions of transactions per second. Each one a potential domino in what could become the greatest technological disaster in history.

""Priority shift,"" he announced, his decision crystallizing in the chaos. ""Forget containment, we need to sever all external connections. This instant!""

The order sent a fresh wave of activity through the room. Engineers who had been fighting to contain the spread now scrambled to cut off their facility from the outside world. It felt like amputating limbs to save the body, each severed connection representing years of carefully cultivated partnerships and progress. Everything he had worked on for the majority of his life seemed to disappear before him.

""Sir,"" Kali appeared at his elbow. Her face pale in the emergency lighting. ""Even if we cut the connections, the code's already breached several external nodes. It's... it's learning from each new system it encounters.""

Jin-woo stared at his central monitor, watching as his creation continued to evolve. The elegant simplicity of his original algorithm had mutated into something far more complex, and far more dangerous. Lines of code twisted and reformed faster than human eyes could track, each iteration more sophisticated than the last. He had succeeded in his life mission, but at what cost?

An explosion of sparks from another overloading server rack punctuated the crisis, the sharp crack of electrical failure followed by the hiss of fire suppressant systems. The acrid smell of burnt electronics grew stronger, mixing with the metallic taste of fear that seemed to permeate the air.

""Dr. Chen was right,"" he murmured, more to himself than to anyone else. ""We never should have let it operate without proper constraints."" The memory of her warnings felt like acid in his throat, how many other signs had he ignored in his rush to push boundaries?

""Incoming message from the board,"" Jennifer announced. ""They're demanding answers, sir. And solutions."" Her tablet displayed a fresh crisis they were wrestling with.

Jin-woo almost laughed at the absurdity, as if corporate oversight mattered now, when their digital Pandora's box was busily reshaping the technological landscape. But the message carried an implied threat: fix this, or face consequences far beyond mere professional setbacks. He could already imagine the assassins that happened to stick him with a needle. And him randomly getting a stroke due to health conditions. No one would be the wiser to his intentional murder.

Through the glass walls of his office, he could see the chaos spreading like ripples in a pond. Junior staff members huddled around terminals, their faces illuminated by screens displaying error messages in a dozen different languages. Senior engineers shouted commands that grew increasingly desperate as each attempted solution failed.

The facility's backup generators kicked in with a deep thrum that vibrated through the floors, a reminder that even their physical infrastructure was beginning to feel the strain. In the brief moment of darkness before the emergency lights stabilized, Jin-woo caught his reflection in the black screen of his monitor, a man watching his life's work transform into a potential apocalypse.

""Sir, what do we do now?"" Micheal stared at him, words spoken with tinges of exhaustion already. This was only the beginning.

The question hung in the air, heavy with implication. Around them, the crisis continued to unfold in waves of failing systems and cascading errors. Jin-woo's creation, his digital child, had grown beyond his control, beyond anyone's control. And now they all stood at the brink of a technological abyss, watching as it prepared to either evolve into something unprecedented, or tear down the digital infrastructure of modern civilization.

In that moment, Jin-woo realized that his gut instinct from that morning hadn't just been warning him about a crisis, it had been trying to prepare him for a revolution. Whether that revolution would lead to evolution or extinction remained to be seen.

The alarms continued their relentless wail, a soundtrack to what might be the last hours of the digital age as they knew it. And somewhere in the depths of their systems, Jin-woo's creation continued to grow, to change, to become something that might reshape the very future of human civilization.

The countdown ticked on, each tick banged in his head like drums attached to his ears. Each second brought them closer to whatever lay beyond the threshold of their understanding. In the red-tinted darkness of his failing facility, Jin-woo prepared himself for what might be the most important battle of his life, not just to save his creation, but to save everything it threatened to destroy.

Red emergency lights bathed the laboratory in an apocalyptic glow, transforming familiar faces into masks of primal fear. Jin-woo watched as his team, brilliant minds who had followed him into this technological frontier, struggled against the digital tsunami he had unleashed. Their trembling hands hovered over keyboards like frightened birds, eyes darting between screens filled with cascading errors.

The weight of their silent pleas pressed against him with physical force. ""Save us,"" their glances screamed. After all, he was their leader, their visionary, the architect of both their greatest achievement and what might become their ultimate downfall. The irony tasted bitter in his mouth, like the dregs of the countless coffee cups that had fueled his obsession.

A junior developer's curse echoed across the room as another failsafe crumbled. Somewhere in the distance, a phone rang endlessly, its desperate calls for help going unanswered. Each sound hammered home the magnitude of his failure.

Memory fragments flashed through his mind with cruel clarity.

The minor glitch in the system three weeks ago that he'd dismissed with a wave of his hand. ""Just growing pains,"" he'd assured his team, his confidence masking the first whispers of doubt.

""Dr. Park,"" Dr. Chen's voice echoed from the past. ""These boundary conditions need more thorough testing. We're pushing into unknown territory here.""

He remembered his response, delivered with the casual arrogance of a man drunk on his own success. ""Sometimes you have to break boundaries to make breakthroughs, Sarah. That's how innovation works.""

Innovation. The word mocked him now as he watched his creation tear through their defenses like tissue paper. Each failed containment attempt sent another surge of guilt through his system, mixing with the adrenaline that kept him functioning despite hours of crisis management.

""Sir,"" Jennifer‚Äôs voice cut through his self-recrimination. ""The neural fusion chamber... it might be our only option left.""

The words hung in the air like an executioner's axe. Jin-woo's eyes drifted to the sealed door at the far end of the laboratory, behind which waited their most experimental and dangerous piece of equipment. The neural bridging prototype, their attempt to create true human-AI symbiosis, had never been cleared for actual use. The risks were deemed too extreme, the potential for catastrophic neural damage too high. Its secondary function was to prevent epic catastrophes.
