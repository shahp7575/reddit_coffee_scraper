1mhvdxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkinSoulSync/comments/1mhvdxv/eli5_whats_the_difference_between_am_and_pm/,ELI5: What's the Difference Between AM and PM Rituals?‚Äã,"I was just thinking about the differences between my morning and evening routines, and wondered what a good ""ELI5"" explanation would be. it seems like the core difference is purpose: AM rituals are often about prepping for the day - energizing, focusing, and getting ready to be productive. Coffee is the classic example, but it could also be meditation, exercise, or planning out your schedule.

PM rituals,on the other hand,seem geared towards winding down and preparing for sleep. This could involve things like dimming the lights, reading a book (paper, not a screen!), or having a cup of herbal tea. The goal is to signal to your body and mind that it's time to relax.

What I find engaging is how much personal preference plays a role.What helps one person energize might overwhelm someone else in the morning, and what helps one person relax might bore someone else to tears in the evening. What are some of the key differences you've noticed in *your* morning vs. evening routines, and why do you think they work for you?",1,1754355697.0,SkinSoulSync,0,1.0,False

I got one of the super early bird Oasis Minis and honestly love it, I love how it looks, how unique it is and barring a few niggly build issues (noise related), I think it's a solid product.

  
But despite feeling like every month there's a new firmware update, there doesn't seem to ever be any new real app features or app maturement, and it's sorely, SORELY missing some simple enhancements I would have expected by now.

  
Simply put here's my wish list that I feel is relatively easy to implement but hugely impactful;

1. The playlist with the auto add the spiral in and out is a total mess. I've seen others complain about this on this forum. The wipe cannot be a playlist item, instead you should be able to pre-select the wipe pattern in the settings. Mainly this is annoying when you add pauses between tracks, and I want one design a day, and the erasing procedure should just happen and more on. This the stupid simple and super annoying!

2. The ability perhaps to add your own image? 

3. Or, make it easier for the community to create their own to a public gallery. 

4. The connect interfact is dumb, no friendly name, when you have two devices, you have to remember the serial number?

I feel this is all app development, cmon Oasis! My wife was really pressuring me to get the big coffee table and right now I'm glad I didn't pull the pin.

Sure I've seen a few tweaks here and there, but the whole experience still feels very beta, buggy and far from optimized.

I‚Äôm a first-time founder in Toronto working on a loyalty program software for small businesses. Think restaurants/cafes, gyms, salons, retail stores, and experience-based venues like escape rooms or arcades.

The goal: get your customers to come back more often, without you having to discount your own product/service, or waste time running a loyalty program.

We haven‚Äôt launched yet, and before we go any further, a friend of mine advised me that I need to sanity-check what we‚Äôre building with the people who‚Äôd actually use it.

If you‚Äôre a Canadian small business owner who:
- Has tried tools like TapMango, Kangaroo Rewards, DataCandy, Thanx, etc. OR
- Doesn‚Äôt have a loyalty program but has struggled with repeat customers.

This isn‚Äôt a sales call. More like an invitation for criticism. I just want real feedback to stop me from building the wrong thing. I‚Äôm also happy to offer anyone who has a conversation with me a free 60 days using the product whenever we do launch (only if you want it, no tricks to lock you into anything long-term, I‚Äôm also happy to have you criticize us over coffee and not have you try anything we‚Äôve built out lol).

I don‚Äôt necessarily need or want advice aside from recommendations for books on religious/mormon trauma and anyone who understands to sit and commiserate with me‚ù§Ô∏è

I‚Äôm just so angry lately. I left the church over 6 years ago and it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve delayed processing it until now. I just woke up mad and sad one day and now I just have to carry it 24/7??? I know it‚Äôs important for me  to finally feel all this after spending my entire life burying every negative emotion (blessed are the peacemakers üòò‚úåÔ∏è), but its so fucking uncomfortable to have nowhere for all this anger to go.  

I finally started therapy a few months ago, and now understand that I have several different mental health issues that cause the anxiety and depression I‚Äôve always thought was the main problem. Every last one of them is affected, whether directly or indirectly, by growing up in the church. I have OCD and developed moral scrupulosity as my main theme which is a hell I wouldn‚Äôt wish on anyone. Undiagnosed ADHD until 27. A mild eating disorder off and on. Maybe autism?? Wrap it all up with CPTSD, my latest diagnosis, which makes it all such a confusing tangle you don‚Äôt know where one issue ends and the next begins! I learned how to mask and dissociate from it all at a very young age because I felt like if I let any flaws show, everyone would figure out that I‚Äôm actually a complete fraud. 

I became obsessed with being percieved as what I had decided was the perfect Mormon- not a weird, cringy Molly Mormon, but the perfect Mormon who could still pass as a Normal Person; one everyone would look at from afar and say ‚Äúshe‚Äôs just so good‚Äù. I took ‚Äúbe an example‚Äù and fucking RAN with it. I wanted my Mormon friends to be impressed by my testimony and unwavering faith but not to think I was superior or stuck up about it. I wanted my non-Mormon friends to think it was so cool that I was so religious but not a freak about it. I wanted to be cool and fun and carefree enough for them to accept me but maintain strong enough in my values that they would never even try to tempt me with alcohol, drugs, or god-forbid, coffee. I felt the weight of the church‚Äôs reputation in small town Midwest on my very young shoulders. It was not healthy and I became a chronic people pleaser to avoid the discomfort of feeling different. 

I was so determined to fit in in every group I was in, that I eventually disconnected entirely from my own opinions, thoughts, feelings. I became a skilled personality sculptor, molding myself hour by hour to be as close as possible the person everyone else wanted me to be. I completely dialed in to everyone else‚Äôs emotions, trying to sense what they wanted or needed me to be or do for them before they knew it themselves, so they never even had a chance to be angry, sad, or disappointed in me. I kept my circle very small, cutting out people who (I thought) needed a person I simply couldn‚Äôt be one by one until there was no one left who really knew my authentic self. Eventually, I lost touch with her too. 

By my early teens, I started treating my life like a checklist as a coping mechanism for having no real identity outside of ‚Äúdaughter of God‚Äù or any clue what I really wanted out of life. Luckily enough, the church pretty much handed said checklist to me, wrapped in a bow as a gift the minute I was given a name, a blessing, and, most importantly, membership number. I was given a literal plan of happiness, and by 8 I had fully committed. I checked every single one of them off that list, the carrot of eternal happiness always just out of reach, propelling me forward to the life I was told I wanted, not a single thought about whether or not I actually did. 

- I finished personal progress before I graduated high school, not so early that I looked like a tryhard but not so late I looked lazy 
- I had a couple boyfriends so everyone knew I was a) straight (I‚Äôm not lol) and b) still a cool normal girl (also not what I am lol), but not so many that people in the ward would think I was a slut
- Graduated HS and seminary with honors and a BYU acceptance letter. 
- Got heavily involved in campus and my YSA ward
- Dated very intentionally with the end goal of marriage
- Waited a respectable amount of time to get engaged (second semester junior year, I was 20, we had been dating for 4 months LOL)
- got married (as a virgin of course!!) in the temple
- waited a respectable amount of time before getting pregnant so that no one would think we rushed into it (LOL) but also not so late people would wonder what was taking so long (18 months LOL)
- graduated with a mommy major (sfl human development girlies where you at) that still had potential for a return to grad school if I wanted to later (gotta make sure people still know I‚Äôm smart)
- all culminating with having my first baby by 23! The perfect age to not be considered too young but also not old (like 25 omg)!! 

I never once thought about my life beyond that, and the prescribed life itinerary got fuzzy past this point. Motherhood was supposed to be the pinnacle of my life, so I kept it on the pedastal the church, my leaders, and my own parents had created for me. I practically worshiped it. I knew that while life would still have its challenges, once I got pregnant, everything would finally start fall into place naturally because this is what I was born for, what God wanted MOST for me! I wasn‚Äôt dumb, I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be easy. But I was promised over, and over, and over that it would be THE MOST REWARDING, FULFILLING, GODLY THING I WOULD EVER DO. Plus I babysat like, a LOT as a teenager so I had plenty of experience obviously!!

And then she was born, and at first, every moment was so beautiful, fun, and even fulfilling‚Äî just like they said it would be! It even still is in some ways. I love my children. They are absolutely incredible, and while I don‚Äôt know exactly what I believe spiritually anymore, there are parts of being their mom that do feel genuinely sacred to me. Watching them grow from little helpless things to people with thoughts and opinions and ideas and natural talents and morals both taught and self discovered??? Indescribably cool. They are so funny and smart and just so GOOD, and I cannot believe I MADE them! They are the two of the lights of my life, and I genuinely do find it a privilege to be their mom. 

The truth is, I love being their mom but I do not like motherhood. It has taken me 7 years to be able to admit that, and I still don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve said it out loud. It is beautiful but it brings out an ugly side of me. It‚Äôs fulfilling in the long term, but physically, emotionally, and mentally draining in the day to day. It‚Äôs triggering to see the things I hate most about myself mirrored in the perfect tiny people I made. It‚Äôs overwhelming to be so needed when I feel like I barely have enough to keep myself alive. Rest is rarely actually restful, due to a million interruptions and intense guilt and shame about not having earned it. There‚Äôs just so much to do, and there will never be enough time, energy, and resources to do it all. 

We have lived in poverty since our eldest was born, because we believed what had been drilled into us from childhood‚Äî that God would provide. He did not. I felt (and still feel!) guilt and shame around our finances, because it seemed like a clear indication that we were doing not doing enough to be eligible for the financial blessings of paying tithing. I literally did not have anything left to give, emotionally or monetarily. I felt shame and embarrassment that we didn‚Äôt have as much as my wealthy friends from BYU, who were already buying McMansions and designer bamboo sleepers for their 4th baby. 

We lived outside of our means in order to keep up with the Jensens and Nelsons and Smiths and Flakes and Kimballs. I had no concept of budgeting or finances because my parents supported me up until I got married, and I never bothered to learn about it because I was uninterested and assumed it would just be my husband‚Äôs job. We now have to live with family because my husband (who also has severe mental health issues and trauma) just doesn‚Äôt have the earning potential to support all of us here (high COL area), but we also can‚Äôt afford to move somewhere cheaper, nor do we want to leave our support system. We can‚Äôt afford the childcare we‚Äôd need for me to work full time unless I go back to school first, which we can‚Äôt afford without me working full time for several years first!!! Of course money can‚Äôt buy happiness, but it does provide peace of mind and comfort, which is something I desperately crave. Who knows, maybe we would still be living like this even if we never had kids or waited longer, but it cannot be denied as a significant factor in my situation now. 

I eventually sank into severe depressive episode and had near mental breakdown that landed me in a 12 week intensive outpatient therapy program earlier this year. I‚Äôm better than before, but my handle on life is still tenuous at best. I feel like I‚Äôm slowly rebuilding a Jenga tower and someone keeps taking blocks out one by one before I‚Äôm done. Sometimes it stays up, just a little less stable than before, and sometimes it all crashes down and I‚Äôm starting from nothing again. 

I wish I could sue the church for tithing repayment, child support, lost wages for what I could‚Äôve been making in the work force during the 6 years I was a stay at home mom, lost wages for what all of my unpaid labor in the home at that time was worth, AND emotional damages. It might just be enough for an apartment and (some of) the therapy we all need. 

anyway, if you made it this far‚Ä¶ thanks for letting me ramble and whine. I know I will get through this and come out the other side, but I just wish I could fucking teleport there. ",1,1754355202.0,exmormon,0,0.67,False

* **Joint LoC:** $19,000 (vehicle parts and vehicle, we‚Äôve had some issues over the last year with them. Still haven‚Äôt sold 2 cars that a year ago we were sure would quickly.)

**Student Loan Debt:** $0. I did not take student loans, and I supported my husband when he went through trade school (8 weeks/year for 4 years).¬†

**ESPP:** $2023.50¬†

**Section Three: Income**

**Monthly Take Home:** Mine is **$4,770** *(2 paycheque months)*

**Monthly Deductions: $2,502.45**¬†

* **Taxes:** $1,550.13
* **EI:** $116.86
* **CPP:** $407.94
* **ESPP:** $213.76
* **DCPP:** $213.76

**Husband‚Äôs take-home is roughly $4,400** (he just started a new job, so this is an estimate based on his hourly wage; he‚Äôll pay around $1,500 in taxes/EI/CPP, not sure yet on everything else)

**Section Four: Travel Expenses**

I planned this trip knowing that Orbit would not be able to pay for much (if anything) for this trip. She intends to pay me back within 6 months. If that happens, super awesome. If it doesn‚Äôt, that doesn‚Äôt bother me or my husband. I included covering her costs in my original budget and savings plan. I will mark out her costs just for transparency, but they aren‚Äôt removed from my costs.¬†

Maggie carpooled with me and Autumn, so we shared gas expenses from Edmonton to Calgary to Drumheller to Edmonton.

I marked all split/shared expenses. I hope it is not too confusing! It confused me as I was writing and doing the math, so hopefully it's accurate!

**Transportation:** **$283.24 -** my cost $220.05, Maggie‚Äôs cost $63.19

* **Gas to/from Edmonton:** $156.85
* **Gas from Edmonton round trip to Calgary/Drumheller:** $126.39 (split 50/50)

**Accommodations:** **$956.17 total** \- My cost $626.88, Maggie's cost $496.73. *Orbit's cost $195.22*

* **One night on route:** Free (at a friend‚Äôs)
* **Two nights in Edmonton:** Free (at a friend‚Äôs and Maggie‚Äôs)
* **Two nights in Calgary:** $305.20 (split 50/50 with Maggie)
* **Three nights in Drumheller:** $650.97 (split 60/40 with Maggie. *Orbit's cost $195.22*)
* **One night in Edmonton:** Free (at Maggie‚Äôs)

**Pre-Vacation Spending: $1024.61** ($442.50 paid back, *Orbit's cost $66.60*)¬†

* **Lion King Tickets:** Tickets purchased in March were $88.50 each, total $708. I paid for 8 tickets and was paid back for 5 of them. Unfortunately, Orbit and Suzy couldn‚Äôt make it, but I was able to get someone to take one ticket last minute.¬† We did have one empty seat, which was unfortunate. I ate the cost of the 2 ‚Äúextra‚Äù tickets ($177).¬†
* **Bikes and Bites:** $177.60. Maggie paid back her cost of $44.40. *Orbit‚Äôs cost $66.60.*
* **Little Red Reading House:** $21 (Autumn got to take a book home)
* **Mastermind Toys**: $43.01.¬† I grabbed some car toys for Autumn before we left.¬†
* **Hiking Toddler Backpack:** $75 from Facebook Marketplace. I got a used, decent brand, solid-framed hiking backpack so I‚Äôd be able to do some of the interesting hikes around Drumheller and just pack the toddler on my back instead of picking hikes a 2-year-old would be able to do.¬†

**Food:¬† $989.80¬† -** my cost $895.71, Maggie‚Äôs cost $94.09

* **Eating out: $490.47** (Maggie‚Äôs Cost $94.09)
* **Groceries: $334.91**
* **Snacks, Drinks and Coffee: $167.42**

**Excursions, Strollers, and Parking:¬† $ 251.04** (Maggie‚Äôs cost $25, *Orbit $45.70*)

**Souvenirs: $217.59**

**Miscellaneous: $120.24** 

***Total Trip Expenses: $3,842.69*** My cost $2,708.18, Maggie cost $723.41, *Orbit cost $302.52*

**Section Five:**¬†

I saved for this trip for about 4 months and put aside $2,500. The majority of that is from a bonus I got in February.¬†

I set up a Google sheet detailing all planned expenses and shared it with Maggie and Orbit so we all knew what we should budget for. My total estimate for this trip was **$2,412.65**.¬†I did not budget for food, parking or souvenirs. 

‚Äì

***Day 1 - Friday:***

Worked all day, gassed up before leaving town ($45.28) and grabbed supper from A&W ($29.16) for Autumn and me before I got home to pack up and take off. We left later than I‚Äôd hoped (wanted to leave at 6 pm and left at 7:30 pm, ugh). I also hoped Autumn would sleep on the drive, but she said sleep is for the weak and didn‚Äôt go to bed till about 11:30 pm. I picked up coffee on the road ($3.00) and grabbed a snack right before getting to my friend‚Äôs house ($11.96). We spent the night there and had a great visit. Autumn loved playing with the dogs.¬†

**Daily total: $89.40**

**‚Äì**

***Day 2 - Saturday***:¬†

Woke up at 7 am, had a slow start to the rainy morning with a dog walk, Saskatoon berry picking, and eggs/mennonite sausage/toast for breakfast. Then we packed up, gassed up ($47.19) and drove to Edmonton. I grabbed a coffee for the road that was free with my points, and luckily, Autumn slept most of the way, so it was an easy drive. Once we got to Edmonton, we stopped for lunch at Southgate. We shared an Ahi-Tuna crispy miso bowl and a strawberry hibiscus wai-tai¬† ($23.39), did some assorted shopping for things we forgot ($92.36 at Winners for shoes for both of us, makeup remover wipes and hair supplies - shampoo, conditioner and curl cream. $27.88 at London Drugs for hair ties, toddler snacks and a razor). Went to my sister Maggie‚Äôs for a bit before going to another friend‚Äôs house. He watched Autumn for the night while I went to the Lion King at the Jubilee. She had a blast doing dance parties and playing with the other kids, and I loved going to the musical. It was phenomenal, the masks, the set, the emotions, just everything. 10/10 no notes. I did have to pay for parking ($7).

**Daily total: $197.82**

**‚Äì**

***Day 3 - Sunday:***

Woke up at 8 am and had pancakes and eggs with my friends and kids. Had a chill (as chill as 5 kids are, haha) morning before Autumn had a nap from 2-3. We then headed out to visit with another friend, got a coffee (she paid!), went for a walk and found a splash park playground. Then we went for supper at a pasta place ($44.90) before heading to Maggie‚Äôs house. Autumn needed a bath as she smelled like a swamp, so she fought that before getting jammies on and heading to bed. I went downstairs and hung out with Maggie, her husband and her friends watching ‚ÄúTo Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar.‚Äù

**Daily total: $44.90**

**‚Äì**

***Day 4 - Monday:***

Woke up at 7 am, showered, packed up our things, had a quick breakfast of toast, eggs and yogurt before hitting the road at 9:30 am. Maggie had to pack, so she didn‚Äôt have time to eat breakfast at the house. We stopped at McDonald's for coffee and a breakfast sandwich before hitting the road (Maggie paid $9). Stopped for gas ($64.33 - will be split) in Red Deer.¬† I accidentally left my wallet on the roof of the car and drove away, but luckily someone was following us, let us know right away, and within 5 minutes I had turned around, found the wallet and was off on the road again. We stopped at Booster Juice for a couple of smoothies for Autumn and me ($14.36) and Starbucks ($17.56 for chocolate milk, a charcuterie board, cheese stick and spicy falafel wrap). Maggie also grabbed snacks and a drink from Starbucks, and then we left.¬†

Arrived in Calgary at 1:30 pm, Maggie had plans for a flash tattoo, so we dropped her off and headed to Butterfield Acres Petting Zoo. ($39.88 for one adult ticket, one child ticket and a pony ride). Autumn enjoyed petting the goats, sheep, pigs and more. The pony ride was very cute, but she did get frustrated that it was over so soon. A slight meltdown ensued, and we headed to the car for a snack. After a quick bite of cheese and meat,¬† we left for the hotel. Autumn had a quick car nap before arriving, and I forgot my wallet at the front desk after checking in, so right after we got up into our room, the concierge knocked and returned it ($305.20 for two nights, split 50/50). Autumn and I hung out in the room to relax for a bit before Maggie arrived, and we went for supper. We decided to have supper at the hotel; I ordered grilled cheese and fries for Autumn, I had a pork steak and veggies with a Moscow Mule, and Maggie had a steak and veggie dish with a Strawberry Bellini. The total after the tip was $122.69 (split 50/50). It was okay, but I always forget that booze costs so much out of the house. Most of the meal was pretty bland as well, so we decided to eat elsewhere the rest of the time in Calgary. After supper, Autumn and I went for a swim at the hotel pool, and Maggie relaxed with a few books and her switch. Autumn hits a point of toddler rage mixed with exhaustion and goes to bed at 8 pm. I stayed up for an hour or so reading Bull Moon Rising by Ruby Dixon, then went to bed myself!¬†

**Daily Total: $564.02** *(When I checked my statement, it appeared the room cost, meal or something else was a different cost than I thought - or we got a discount cause our window leaked overnight due to rain. It didn‚Äôt wreck anything or leak much, so I wasn‚Äôt concerned about switching rooms. I assume maintenance came up at some point during the day on Monday to check it out. I thought the meal was $140-150 after the tip, but that was different from what my credit card statement showed.)*

***‚Äì***

***Day 5 - Tuesday***:

Autumn woke up at 8 am, and we had a rainy, slow morning before heading to OEB for breakfast at 9:45 am. I ordered the A-Lott A-Laks breakfast poutine and a coffee. It was amazing and so delicious! Autumn had pancakes, a fancy hot chocolate and berries with whipped cream. Maggie had the smoked salmon eggs Benny. The meal was so good, everyone left very satisfied (with the tip $96.72 - split 50/50). We decided to head to the zoo despite the rain and see how the day goes. Autumn fell in love with the penguins and had a great time in the playground zone. Autumn was free, my ticket¬† ($47.20), parking for the day ($13), and the wagon rental ($10). I also treated Maggie and myself to lattes ($8.30). We wandered around for a few hours before stopping for lunch at one of the cafes ($19.80) for a yogurt parfait, chicken Caesar salad wrap and a fountain drink. We grabbed another set of lattes to counter the cold, rainy day ($14.60). Autumn slowly fell asleep in the wagon and missed the last exhibit of owls, then she woke up and we hit up the gift shop to return the wagon and buy one souvenir from the zoo. She picked out 4 different polar bears and a few birds, but ultimately chose one of the polar bears ($12.59). We headed back to the hotel and had leftover pasta for supper. I grabbed some milk from the front desk for Autumn, one chocolate and one regular ($7 - on my room tab). Maggie left to visit with some friends, and Autumn and I went to the pool again before she went to bed. I stayed up to finish my book before going to bed myself.¬†

**Daily Total: $229.21** *(Milk also wasn't charged to my card - see previous day‚Äôs comment).*

***‚Äì***

***Day 6 - Wednesday:***

Autumn woke up at 6:45 am, packed up and checked out of the hotel. We went to Helen‚Äôs Place for breakfast, I had a trucker meal (eggs, bacon, sausage, ham and toast), and Autumn had a fruit bowl with some of my bacon, eggs and ham ($41.82 with tip). Then we went to Costco for groceries for the next few days, we grabbed mostly snacks; fruit gummies, fruit bars, jerky, yogurt, cookies, sandwich meat, lasagna, rotisserie chicken, potato salad, Caesar salad dressing, cereal and whipped cream ($242.76 - lots of this came home after the trip). After stocking up, we went to a cafe for a cappuccino ($7.67) before going to a park to hang out before our next stop, the Little Red Reading House. I prepaid for our appointment, so it was technically free today; it is in ‚Äúpre-trip costs‚Äù as $21. This was so, so cool. The entire house is set up for children to roam and look at books, or do crafts. Then, at the end, you get to take a book home. Autumn picked *Chicka Chicka Boom Boom*. I did have to pay for parking during our booking ($2).¬†

We met up with Maggie after leaving the Little Red Reading House and checked out Stash quickly. It‚Äôs a cute little fibre arts store, and Maggie grabbed a felting owl kit. Then we went for a quick bite to eat before leaving Calgary, Inglewood Drive-In ($16.43). They had a ride on elephant in the lobby, and Autumn liked sitting on it before it started moving, but then she was not a fan. We left for Drumheller at 1:45, and Maggie grabbed us lattes for the road (she paid). Once we got to Drumheller, we checked into our motel, a triple suite with a kitchen ($650.73, split 3 ways, I‚Äôm covering mine and Orbit‚Äôs portions, but Maggie will be paying a bit extra to have the larger bed and room to herself). Once we unpacked and settled a bit, Autumn and I went for a walk to the Heritage Antique Museum ($12), and I grabbed us each a Freezie ($4.50). We walked back to the motel and then went to explore Drumheller a bit, then stopped by a local brewery to grab some beers and coolers ($33.55) before going to Fresno Bros to grab a few more groceries that we forgot about earlier; juice, bread, cheese, milk, chocolate milk, eggs, bacon, steaks, cottage cheese, water, body wash and toothbrushes (I spent $92.15, Maggie spent $118.56 - this included some other things like ibuprofen, body wash and shampoo she needs for home too). I also stopped for gas ($62.06 - split 50/50) before Orbit and Suzy arrived at 7 pm, and we had a chill evening bathing toddlers before all going to bed. Orbit paid $49 for fruit and veggies from H&W produce (carrots, lettuce, tomato, peppers, cherries, strawberries, blueberries, cauliflower, broccoli, celery, and corn on the cob).¬†

**Daily total: $1,165.67** ***(doesn‚Äôt include Orbit‚Äôs or Maggie‚Äôs grocery costs, they are there for transparency)***¬†

***‚Äì***

***Day 7 - Thursday:***

We woke up at 8 am, then made some eggs, bacon, cut up some fruit and made sandwiches, chopped veggies and assorted snacks to pack along with us. We headed over to our e-bike rental for 10 am at Bikes and Bites. It took all of us a bit to get coordinated, but once we did, we all had a blast ($177.60 for the bikes, in prepaid expenses, and $15.70 for parking). Autumn loved riding in the trailer, and Suzy had fun on the tow-along bike. Maggie stopped and grabbed us all a bubble tea once we finished, and we headed to the splash park (another $15.70 for parking - 2 vehicles, 3 hours each) to help beat the heat. This was the first day of the trip it was above 20, and it was so nice!! Autumn saw someone else with ice cream cones and wanted one of her own, so we went and grabbed an ice cream sandwich ($3.75), but I had to eat the sandwich part; she only wanted the ice cream. I grabbed myself some flavoured shaved ice ($8), sour watermelon, strawberry and lemon. Delicious! After we played in the water some more, we got changed and went to the World‚Äôs Largest Dinosaur, Tyra. You can walk up the stairs to its mouth and take photos from inside. Unfortunately, Tyra will be taken down by the end of 2029, so if you have plans to go to Drumheller to see her, do it before then! It cost ($10) for Orbit, Suzy, Autumn and me to climb her, and Maggie stayed at the bottom and took some other photos of us. After that, it was time to head back to the motel for supper: we had BBQ steak, BBQ corn on the cob, veggies, potato salad, Caesar salad, and the adults each had a beer bought yesterday. I also prepaid the Royal Tyrell Museum tickets for tomorrow, and that came to $75.00 for 3 adult tickets and 2 kids Funbooks (Maggie sent $25 for her portion right away as well). After the kids went to bed, I went out by myself to take some photos of the HooDoos and have a bit of a solo-break time ($0.56 for parking). Came back, showered and went to bed!

**Daily Total: $128.71**

**‚Äì**

***Day 8 - Friday:***

Autumn had a rough night but still woke up at 8 am. We got a breakfast together of leftovers, omelette, potatoes and bacon with some very weak motel coffee. Then we went to the Royal Tyrrell Museum, grabbed a coffee to drink ($7.09, just mine; Maggie grabbed her own) before going through all the exhibits. I did rent a stroller again ($3) so Autumn had somewhere to nap if she wanted to (spoiler alert: she did not). At the end, we walked through the gift shop and Autumn picked out a chocolate Dino sucker, a Dino T-shirt, a hatching Dino egg, and we picked out a T-shirt for my husband ($65.51). We went back to the motel for lunch and had potato salad, rotisserie chicken and chopped salad, then Orbit, Suzy, Autumn, and I packed up our things to go for a hike at Horsethief Canyon. Maggie stayed back to nap and prep for supper while we were out. We didn‚Äôt do a super long, intense hike, but it was a good hill down and up a few times, just checking out all the cool rocks and surfaces. Autumn decided she wanted out of the backpack carrier and hiked up the last hill relatively on her own. At the top, we had a little picnic, and the girls loved seeing all the gophers and watching how close they‚Äôd get to food. At 5 pm, we headed back to the motel for a lasagna supper. Autumn passed out on the way back and was very grumpy to wake up once we arrived. The rest of the evening was fairly chill. After supper, Orbit, Suzy, Autumn, and I went for a walk, and Autumn fell asleep in the hiking backpack when we got back.

**Daily Total: $75.54**

**‚Äì**

***Day 9 - Saturday:***

Around 8:30 am, Suzy woke up not feeling super great and didn‚Äôt have a great sleep, so Autumn and I left for a short walk (5 minutes!). Then we went to WIFFs for breakfast and waited for everyone else to join us. The waitress was excellent and didn‚Äôt bat an eye or seem bothered by us adding a chair or a new person a few times. They‚Äôre known for their pancakes and waffles, so we all had something along those lines ($91.46, split 50/50 between Maggie and me). Then we packed up, washed the last of the dishes and checked out of our room. No one was 100% ready to leave Drumheller just yet, so we went downtown to check out a few shops and get some souvenirs ($111.14 at the Fossil Shop for some fossils, petrified wood and dinosaur soapstone carvings, and then $28.35 at another little shop for a ceramic HooDoo and sticker). We also stopped for some bubble tea ($9.76) and took some photos of the kids with dinosaur statues. Then we drove to Wayne and tried to get lunch at The Last Chance Saloon, but it was a 1-2 hour wait, so we just decided to leave and head back to Edmonton. We stopped in Red Deer for a bite to eat and a toddler-car-break at Peter‚Äôs Drive-In ($33.97 - burger, hot dog, drink, milkshake, fries and an ice cream cone). We got to Maggie‚Äôs around 7 pm and had a chill evening playing Mario Party and watching Little Bear.

**Daily Total: $274.68**

**‚Äì**

***Day 10 - Sunday:***

We woke up around 8 am, had a little breakfast of eggs and sausage, before we packed up and visited both my brothers. After our visits, I stopped to gas up ($64.38) and stopped for coffee/donuts at Krispy Kreme($19.52, a dozen donuts and a drink) - I didn‚Äôt know there was one in Edmonton, not the best donuts, but their iced coffee was good! On the way through Whitecourt, we stopped at Booster Juice for some smoothies ($16.36) before getting home around 7 pm.¬†

**Daily Total: $100.26**

**‚Äì**

Overall, we had a great time and I would do it again! I wish our weather were slightly better for Calgary, but it meant there weren‚Äôt a ton of people at the zoo. I was within $200 of what I saved, so I am quite happy! I was not focusing on what we were spending, I felt like we‚Äôd stick near the budget, and I wasn‚Äôt wrong! There were a few things I under-budgeted for (Calgary Zoo was $10 more expensive for my ticket, and I didn‚Äôt factor in parking or stroller rentals), and I had no budget in mind for food, so I am pleasantly surprised we were so close to what I had saved.",3,1754355110.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,0,0.71,False

How do we fix it?,"Based on my own personal experiences and from posts on Reddit, some people seem to be struggling with loneliness (myself included on occasion). If they don't have any family or close friends to reach out to, how are they supposed to find support? I understand that it can be mental health related in some cases but I imagine most people know how woeful our mental health system is.

It has traditionally affected older people, but it seems that more and more young people are beginning to suffer from it too. Yes you can reach out to strangers on the Internet or call a phone number but in my opinion nothing can replace in person interactions with people.

I especially feel for people who live in rural areas or in small towns where your options to find something to join or do are extremely limited.

I for one would think that some sort of service where people visit someone who is lonely in their home once a fortnight and just have a cup of coffee or a beer and just talk to them for a bit would do wonders for so many people.",0,1754354277.0,newzealand,13,0.5,False

But basically my brother in law has been staying in our basement. He doesn't pay rent, he barely helps with chores.

My mom told me how disgusting my house was cause the 2 of them never cleaned, anyway that's not even the most excruciating part. 

I didn't want him to stay with us, but he was kicked out and not really enough time given between finding places so he asked my husband..my husband asked me. I felt bad was told it was only for few months..I knew in my head be longer but what ever couldn't let him go on the streets? 

Those few months turned into a year. I told him I was doing fertility treatments, then I got pregnant. I wanted him gone then but didn't say anything. Baby was due to be here, deff wanted him gone then but I was like what ever here's some ground rules if you have to stay here every one agreed..now my daughter is gone. I'm grieving hard. 

I want my space back, I want to maybe put her stuff away one day but I can't with him in my basement. Im tired of crying with my morning coffee then here he comes to make breakfast. I finally said something to my husband. Long story short, he took his side.

I'm starting up a writing group where we drink things (water, coffee, tea, whatever) and write a bit. Or write a lot, drink a little. It's up to you. The first event will be on August 18, 6 pm at Minneapolis Cider Co. I'll be there with a sign. If you would like a link to the Meetup group, feel free to let me know and I'll send you a message.

Here's more info:

We will be meeting at 6 pm at¬†**Minneapolis Cider Co.**¬†All you need to bring is what you prefer to write with - notebook, laptop + charger, or typewriter will suffice. After around an hour to 90 minutes, we will then begin the talking portion if you wish to leave. No hard feelings!!

**Vibes:**¬†Minneapolis Cider Co is a nice, large spot with options to play Pickleball. It is on the darker side, as most of their windows face the street and there is no direct sunlight. However, there is still some natural light that filters through. There are also board games to play after, if we wish.

It can get crowded and noisy depending on the night and if there is pickleball going, so if you get distracted easily, headphones would be a good bet!

**Drink offerings:**¬†A pint of cider at Minneapolis Cider Co runs about $7-10. They have a variety of ciders, as well as THC beverages you can consume, as well as some craft cocktails.

**ood offerings:**¬†There is a small selection of crepes and galettes.

**Parking:**¬†There is a small lot out front, street parking out front, and a large lot in back. You may have to walk to the front to enter, though.

**Outlets:**¬†I believe there are outlets on the walls, but not in the center of the space. I will do my best to confirm before our meeting!

**Wifi:**¬†Free and abundant.

**Accessibility:**¬†I believe there is a small stair to get into the building at the front, but no stairs if you enter through the back (Haralson Room).

# Star Trek Little House Crossover

**LH Episode Name**: The Vulcan

**ST Episode Name:** The Western Front, the Previous Frontier.

The USS Enterprise goes thru a black hole with unexpected results.. sending it earth's solar system but back in time to the 1870s. Spock realizing that this could be a once in a lifetime chance, if only to gather samples of long extinct plants to be able to bring them back to present day. He, Kirk, and the Doc beam to an abandoned farmhouse outside Walnut Grove, Minnesota. They first notice they are dressed in period clothing. Spock says that this by wearing them, they will be less conspicuous, but still to limit interactions with people. Spock also says he will do the plant gathering, but wants Kirk and the Doc to head into town and pick up a few things at this place called ""Oleson's Mercantile"" about two miles down the road.

Kirk and the Doc head to the center of town to get things on Spock's list, while Spock starts to collect plant samples along a creek. Not too far away at the Ingalls' farm, Laura is rushing thru her post school chores so she can go fishing up the creek. Spock keeps following the creek gathering more different types plants. Laura, now done with chores and ready to fish, sees him near her favorite fishing spot and comes over to say hello. Laura charms Spock with her smile and cuteness. She asks him about his ears, and he explains he from a place far away and is Vulcan. Her reply is ""is that some kinda religion?"". He smiles and laughs. She asks if he wants to fish with her. The whole rest of the scene could be cute banter between Spock and Laura. (I could totally see it)

Meanwhile Kirk and the Doc arrive in town, but get distracted when the Doc saw, Doc Baker's office sign next to the post office as they were walking into town. Not wanting to a chance to miss to talk to another Doctor and possibly someone with a bit more open mind, Doc McCoy and Kirk go over and have a chat with the good doctor (baker). As expected Baker is open minded and interested that they are from space AND another time. They mention the Mercantile, and Baker warns them about the town busy body, Harriet, and not to reveal themselves as from the future.

Kirk and the Doc (McCoy) go to the Mercantile to get the stuff on the list. Nels waits on them and is boxing up the order. Nels is a bit curious about the order as it's not typical stock up order for new people in town. (i.e. flour, sugar, coffee, nails, fabric, etc), but mostly books, medicine tonics, and a few odds and ends. 

Harriet comes down the stairs and goes behind the counter just as Nels was about to ring everything up. She does her usual ""oh who are you.. you new in town?"" nosy neighbor thing with Kirk and the Doc. Kirk and the Doc look at each other and whisper ""this must be Harriet"". They converse and Harriet is a bit suspicious.. especially when she said 'cash or charge' and Kirk not knowing what she meant. Then she points to his bulging wallet in his back pocket. ""oh you mean this"" Kirk acting surprised and not knowing what to do with it, he puts it down on the counter and says ""here take what you want out of this"" (again cuz he has no idea what paper money is). Harriet picks a few bills out of the top and pulls. She makes change, and gives it to Kirk, who has no idea what to do with it. Then she says ""put it in your pocket"". He say ""oh"" and does. Then he and the Doc leave. Seconds after, Harriet looks at Nels and says some comment about the Doc and Kirk. Then Doc baker arrives and says ""I see you met our newest neighbors"". Nels and Harriet say ""Yeahhh"". Harriet say ""they were.. strange. It was like he didn't know what money was... "". Doc Baker laughs and say ""Lets just say they aren't from around here"".

Laura brings Spock home to meet Charles and the rest of the family. Spock is kind and gentle enough. Charles finds him fascinating. Carrie wanted to sit in his lap. Mary was reserved and Caroline was cautious (""well he seemed nice enough.. but odd"" she would say). Spock would stay long enough for a meal, remarks at how delicious Caroline's biscuits are, but is pushed out after Charles plays one song on the fiddle. (Spock does not enjoy Charles' fiddle)

Spock returns back to the abandoned farmhouse to find Kirk and McCoy with the goods. They tell Spock about their day, Doc Baker, and Mrs Oleson. Spock tells Kirk and McCoy about meeting a ""rural rustic farming family named Ingalls and their daughter Laura"". McCoy remarks how familiar the name ""Laura Ingalls"" is but cannot place it, so he asks ""Computer. Tell me about ""Laura Ingalls"" and the computer replies with ""Do you mean Laura Ingalls Wilder 1867 to 1957 An American Pioneer author, who wrote the ""Little House"" series of books? Or do you mean Melissa Gilbert 1964 to 2065 An American Actress who starred as Laura Ingalls Wilder in the 1970s and 1980s NBC Television program Little House on the Prairie?"". They quickly realize that Spock has met Laura Ingalls Wilder when she was a little girl. Realizing his introduction into her life may change her future, he devises a plan to meet her again to tell her not to write about this.

Meanwhile Harriet becomes suspicious, tells Willie and Nellie about Kirk and McCoy and their visit to the Mercantile over dinner that night, who promptly set out to find them the next day. They do and willie spies on them in the abandoned farmhouse. He sees Spock with his pointy ears and using some of foreign high tech gear. They report back to harriet who declares them unholy, then brings it up at church on Sunday. She clashes with the Ingalls bring up that they met a 'nice' spock and realize that he must be connected to the two men that came into the Mercantile. To settle this, they both.. the ingalls and the olesons, along with several other towns members, march to the abandoned farmhouse. Charles opens the door and everyone walks in just as Kirk, Spock, and Doctor McCoy beam back up to the Enterprise. 

Not knowing what they saw.. they all assume it was a St Elmo's Fire and no one was really there inside. But days later, Laura is fishing near the creek and Spock beams down. Excited to see Spock again and realizing that what the town saw a few days ago was true.. they did beam away.. she runs over. They have a cute exchange of dialogue and at the end he tells her to never tell anyone they met again and to NEVER write this part of her life down.

And the episode ends with a voice over of Laura going ""If I had a remembrance book, I would only write about how today was a fine day for fishing and just leave it at that""",1,1754353525.0,littlehouseonprairie,0,1.0,False

This is my first story and so sorry for the writing, english is not my native language.
I (F29) have a long history with my husband's (M29) family. We've been together since 2015 and got married in 2021. From the start, his family was overprotective of him. They'd always cover up his mistakes and solve his problems for him. But the biggest issue for me was that they would have family gatherings with just his parents and the kids. My sister-in-law and I were not considered ""part of the family,"" even after three years.
The most memorable example was a family photo session. They told us we couldn't go because they wanted photos of ""just family."" I was completely against this. My husband didn't understand my frustration, insisting that his family was just different. I argued that we could simply step out of some photos, but they kept pushing the ""just family"" rule.
I stopped talking to my husband for an entire day because he once again chose them and failed to set boundaries. He always wanted to please them, no matter what. To make him happy, they eventually invited me, but the ""photo session"" turned out to be a marriage proposal from his father to his mother. It was deeply hurtful that they didn't consider his sons' long-term girlfriends worthy of being there for such a significant moment.
For years, I fought with my husband, trying to make him see how wrong it was for them to exclude us. He promised things would change, but they never did.
After we got married, my husband lost his job. His parents helped us financially, but they also demanded a lot of his time‚Äîcoffee dates, lunches, and shopping trips‚Äîwhile I was working 10+ hours a day at a job I hated.

Our relationship was also strained by physical, verbal, and emotional abuse. He treated me more like a roommate, lacking affection and intimacy. Combined with his parents' emotional and financial manipulation, I finally left him in March of this year.
During our separation, while we were working on ourselves individually, his family ""coincidentally"" started planning a dream family trip. We eventually started talking again, setting boundaries and making agreements. I finally got him to understand my issues with his family. However, he then told me he was going on the trip with them at the end of July. He's currently there as I write this.

The only thing that has helped has been a topical pomade i use for well atopic dermatitis issues. But even though it goes away it comes back again and i don't quite know what has been causing it. I have just been very stressed with work so that might be the main reason, but i have also been eating badly lately and they say its nickel allergies, it got better for me when i quit instant coffee but now i am doubting that is all there is to it because it came back.
Anyways while googling online i just found out about all the foods that can trigger it and damn it i eat all of those. I love dairy, i eat eggs everyday so apperantly that may be a trigger too. So my question is how do you guys eat with this condition, it seems so hard to quit all these because i genuinely won't know what to eat anymore if i cut them out. And i don't know with what do i replace eggs in the morning with. I mostly just eat breakfast and lunch, i don't eat much but if i cut these out too, i know i will get extremely hungry and have severe lack or energy so i will end up indulging into sugary foods and carbs in general.

1mhuegb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Commodities/comments/1mhuegb/breaking_into_the_physical_commodities_industry_a/,Breaking Into the Physical Commodities Industry ‚Äì A No-BS Guide,"This post is a summarized version from u/Samuel-Basi. Samuel has over 15 years of experience in the metals derivatives and physical markets, and is the author of the book ***Perfectly Hedged: A Practical Guide To Base Metals***. [You can find the full post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Commodities/comments/1kx0n75/for_those_trying_to_break_into_physical/).

Here‚Äôs a realistic roadmap for anyone trying to break into commodity trading (metals, oil, ags, energy, etc.). This is based on industry experience. Save it, study it, and refer to it often.

# You Won‚Äôt Start as a Trader (And You Shouldn‚Äôt)

* Don‚Äôt chase trading roles straight out of university. You won‚Äôt be ready.
* Traders get little room for error, flame out early and you‚Äôre done.
* Instead, aim for **entry-level ops roles** (scheduling, logistics, middle-office) to learn the business.

# Start Where You Can. Learn Everything.

* **Middle-office** is best: you'll interact with risk, finance, front-office, and more.
* **Back-office** is fine too, just get in and be curious.
* **Find mentors**, ask questions, be a sponge.

# Apply Relentlessly. Network Aggressively.

* Big grad programs get **thousands of applicants,** don‚Äôt rely on those alone.
* Use **LinkedIn, recruiters, cold emails, coffee chats,** whatever it takes.
* Small and mid-size shops can offer **faster responsibility** and better learning opportunities.

# Degrees: They Help, But They‚Äôre Not Everything

* Background matters less than **your attitude and curiosity**.
* Whether it‚Äôs STEM or humanities, can you hold a smart, humble conversation?
* Most hiring comes down to: *‚ÄúCan I sit next to this person for 9 hours a day?‚Äù*

# Commodity Masters Degrees? Be Careful.

* Some (like **Uni Geneva‚Äôs MSc**) are well-respected and have strong placement.
* Many are **useless without real experience**.
* Always prioritize actual work experience over fancy credentials.

# Skills That Matter Most

* **Coding is a bonus**, not a must (unless you're aiming for quant/analytics).
* **Languages help**, but your **soft skills are critical**.
* This is a **relationship-driven industry,** be personable, reliable, and sharp.

# Practice Interviewing (Seriously)

* Do mock interviews. Get feedback from people who don‚Äôt know you well.
* Be able to speak intelligently about the industry, even at a basic level.
* Confidence > memorized talking points.

# Don‚Äôt Be Commodity-Specific Early On

* Focus on **getting into the industry**, not chasing only oil/metals/etc.
* Skills are **transferable across commodities,** specific focus can come later.

# Be Geographically Open

* Willingness to **move or travel** increases your odds.
* Global mobility is often part of the job anyway, be ready for it.

Final Thoughts

Breaking into commodities isn‚Äôt easy, but it‚Äôs **absolutely possible**. Be humble, stay curious, show real passion, and keep grinding. The industry rewards those who **learn the fundamentals, build strong relationships, and aren‚Äôt afraid to hustle.**",8,1754353019.0,Commodities,1,1.0,False

It was edible but the end result wasn‚Äôt at all how it was supposed to come out! But I have a full belly, so I‚Äôm happy.

Feeling better from two weeks of AIP has me looking at the health/beauty/household products I use and their ingredients‚Äô effects on my body. I won‚Äôt do an entire overhaul right now, but I‚Äôm trying to better educate myself about chemicals, pesticides, additives, etc that contribute to immune issues. My hope is that with enough of the proper information, I can phase out certain every day products I use and introduce ‚Äúsafer‚Äù ones.

This also has me looking at ways to simplify my life. So as not to ramble, I won‚Äôt get into it now, but I will express how grateful I am that beginning AIP has caused such a domino effect of personal mindfulness.

I planned to do AIP for 30 days, but with it being as easy as it has been so far, I may extend it to 60. Depending on what symptoms are present at day 30, I might introduce coffee back in. I simply miss the taste!

Anyway, I look forward to what awaits me tomorrow. As I did the last two weeks, I‚Äôll take my measurements to jot down. As with every day, I‚Äôll weigh myself and make note of symptoms. Enjoying this new way of getting to know my body and myself. Yay!

I'll start with the first incident, goes back about 4 months. I was home hanging out with family and friends, I got about 7-8 hours of sleep (not the best quality), and we had been out and about the entire day, I didnt have much to eat (less than 1000 calories), and had less than 1L of water, it was a hot day (stupid I know), and I sat, stood, and sat in quick succession and blacked out. I remember sitting in the chair next to my friend and immediately just making a groaning noise that I couldnt control, and I remember thinking what is happening I gotta stop, and just falling forward. Some say i was twitching (not full body convulsions though), but i was rushed to the ER, and couldnt drive for a month. Docs checked me out, clean EEG, ECG, MRI. the whole bunch. Fast forward 2 months, all is going well, and this time I am home again, I went to bed a bit later than usual watching a show, and slept 6-7 hours (awkward timing and not great sleep probably), but i was eating well and drank a decent amount of water ( 1.5 L), but it was hot in mu room upstairs and I again blacked out. This time i stood up to grab socks, kneeled next to the cupboard, and blacked out. same way it happened the first time, made a groaning noise, and remember blacking out, no one found me till i was basically up that time around tho. Now the third, and final time. I was a bit low on sleep (8 hours but weird timings again), and this time i went on a run since i wanted to get into that, ran a 3 mile, was exhausted and felt like i got hit by a bus, had lunch at 11:30, and drank a liter during the run and almost a liter in the hours after, yet by 3:30 i had blacked out, same exact thing happened with the groaning and remember blacking out. And this time i was apparently twitching again. All 3 times it took me around 30 ish minutes to regain any kind of consciousness or understanding, for the first 15-20 i couldnt even remember what I did with anyone in that day, all 3 days  I drank an instant coffee, the first and second day it was a few hours before i blacked out, but the third i was still drinking my coffee only halfway done with it. Not the type of person to be scared of something that may happen, but I don't know how to feel.

Google diagnosed it as scombroid poisoning from tuna, but I'm not sure. The symptoms wore off after a day, and I didn't even see a doctor.

1mhu9n6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mhu9n6,Review: Ben & Jerry's Fudgy Flan (FINALLY my turn!!!),"Since the second I heard of this flavor, I've been on the hunt for it. I absolutely love flan, it's been one of my favorite desserts ever since I was little. But I couldn't find it! Over the last few weeks I've been watching what feels like *everyone else* on this sub living my dream! Until today, when it's magical presence revealed itself at my neighborhood Safeway. So let's get into it. 

Ben & Jerry's describes this flavor as ""burnt caramel ice cream with fudge brownies & pastry cream swirls"". The base was what I was most curious about... would it really taste like flan? My verdict is *yes*! On my first bite, I tasted the light coffee flavor I've seen others describe. But it fades into a rich, eggy, creamy & caramel-y flavor that's unique to flan. The texture of the base is scrumptious. I was able to pull my spoon through with clean precision (after letting it thaw a bit of course), but it still remained thick and mouth-filling. 

The ""pastry cream swirls"" have been a point of debate. Some people claim they were nonexistent, and some noted a light presence. That's what the yellow circles are, my best guess of what I believe are the pastry cream swirls. Did they add much flavor? No, definitely not. At most, I would describe them as having a *very light* condensed milk taste. Just a hint. They certainly weren't as present as the picture on the packaging would lead you to believe. But honestly, this ice cream didn't even need that element. 

Onto the brownies. The brownies!!! Wow. A major highlight. I've had a lot of ice cream in my life, and I believe this is the best brownie mix-in I've ever tried. They tasted like the Ghirardelli brownies my mom used to make at home, just amazing. The texture felt like you had just cut it freshly out of the pan they were baked in. They weren't soggy, and they were light years away from being dry. They had a lovely chew, and a bold fudgy flavor. 

This ice cream was everything I hoped it would be. I was unsure if you could really get an ice cream to taste like flan, but I think this flavor did it justice. The pastry cream swirls were difficult to find and pretty unnecessary, but the brownies were a slam dunk. I would highly recommend picking up this ice cream if you see it.

At opening I had a hard time self starting and knowing what to do next. At closing I also forgot after weeks of doing it and had a hard time adapting to what needed to be done first or at all. Not all of it is imposter syndrome because managers would discuss it with me, each other, and I found out later from a friend most of the time other workers were a bit bummed because when they had a shift with me they knew they had to carry the slack.

1mhu260,https://www.reddit.com/r/AustraliaPost/comments/1mhu260/aggressive_staff_member_ascot_lpo/,Aggressive staff member Ascot LPO,Just a heads up using Ascot LPO there is a man in there that is pretty aggressive. I collected a small parcel and was getting rid of some of the tape etc because I walked there. They have a bin in there which I thought was what it was for. He yelled at me to take it with me outside like I‚Äôd just shot his dog. I wasn‚Äôt served by him and the lady that did was lovely and professional. I said oh ok and suggested it might be a good idea to supply one for customers. Did as I was told and walked outside to the sidewalk not even thinking it was that big of a deal. He follows me outside and yells out passive aggressively for me to have a fantastic day. This is infront of people getting coffee. I walked back and said pardon because I didn‚Äôt hear what he was saying at first. He repeated it and called me a bitch and slammed the door. I stood there shocked. Never in my life have I ever had anyone speak to me like that before let alone follow me outside. I‚Äôm terrified to ever go in there again. It was such a mountain out of a molehill for no real reason. I know Australia Post doesn‚Äôt care about things like this but if you‚Äôre in that area just be mindful of this guy.,12,1754352086.0,AustraliaPost,7,0.88,False
1mhu207,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Super-Ad-1340/comments/1mhu207/how_i_went_from_zero_motivation_to_loving_every/,How I Went from Zero Motivation to Loving Every Minute of Learning (And You Can Too!),"Hey everyone,

I used to dread tackling anything new‚Äîwhether it was learning a language, picking up a coding framework, or even just trying to read a book. I‚Äôd procrastinate for days, then beat myself up for not making progress. Sound familiar?

A few months ago, I decided enough was enough. I craved the confidence that comes with mastering new skills, so I experimented with a few strategies that completely flipped my mindset. Here‚Äôs what worked for me:

# 1. Define Your ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù

‚Ä¢ **Dig deep.** Instead of ‚ÄúI should learn Python,‚Äù ask **why**‚Äîis it to build your own game? Automate a boring task? Land a dream job?  
‚Ä¢ **Write it down.** Place sticky notes around your workspace with that core reason to keep your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù front and center.

# 2. Break It Into Tiny Wins

‚Ä¢ **Microgoals rock.** Commit to just **5 minutes** a day. That‚Äôs enough to build momentum without feeling overwhelmed.  
‚Ä¢ **Celebrate small victories.** Finished one tutorial exercise? üéâ Pat yourself on the back and record it in a quick journal.

# 3. Make It Social

‚Ä¢ **Find accountability buddies.** Share your goals with a friend, subreddit, or Discord group. Weekly check-ins keep you honest.  
‚Ä¢ **Teach what you learn.** Write a quick Reddit post or explain the concept to someone else. Teaching cements understanding.

# 4. Mix Fun with Focus

‚Ä¢ **Gamify your progress.** Use apps like Habitica or Duolingo‚Äôs streaks to turn learning into a game.  
‚Ä¢ **Variety keeps you curious.** If you‚Äôre tired of videos, switch to podcasts, articles, or hands-on projects.

# 5. Embrace the Struggle

>

# My Daily Routine

1. **Morning (5‚Äì10 min):** Quick review of yesterday‚Äôs notes while having coffee.
2. **Midday (5 min):** Solve one micro-exercise on your phone during lunch.
3. **Evening (10‚Äì15 min):** Work on a fun mini-project‚Äîno pressure, just play.

# Your Turn

1mhu1x9,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftRecommendations/comments/1mhu1x9/birthday_wishes_for_mentor_whats_the_right_way_to/,Birthday wishes for Mentor ‚Äî what‚Äôs the right way to do it?,"If you‚Äôve ever wondered whether it's appropriate to wish your mentor a happy birthday‚Äîor even give a small gift‚Äîyou‚Äôre not alone. It‚Äôs one of those things that can feel tricky, especially in an internship or office setting. You want to be respectful without going overboard.

So we went through what other Redditors have shared on this, and here‚Äôs a simple, people-first guide that keeps it thoughtful, genuine, and workplace-appropriate.

# 1. A handwritten card goes a long way

This came up over and over again. A handwritten card with a short, warm birthday wish is **always appreciated**. You don‚Äôt need to get fancy. Just a couple of lines showing that you appreciate their time, support, and mentorship is often enough to leave a lasting impact.

**What other Redditors say:**

‚ÄúA respectful card with warm wishes is remembered.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs formal and nice. I told my kid to do the same.‚Äù

# 2. Consider your company culture

Every workplace is different. Some are friendly and open, while others are more formal. If you‚Äôre in a supportive environment where people wish each other well, go ahead and write that card or say something in person.

But if the office is very hierarchical or reserved, it might feel more appropriate to skip birthday wishes and instead express your appreciation at the end of your internship or job. Trust your read on the room.

**What other Redditors say:**

‚ÄúIf you're second guessing, maybe wait till the end of the internship.‚Äù ‚ÄúCulture matters‚Äîfriendly workplaces are usually open to it.‚Äù

# 3. Keep gifts light or humorous‚Äîif you give one at all

Most people agree that **you shouldn‚Äôt spend money** or give anything that feels like a big gift. That can get awkward and sometimes even come off wrong.

If you're close to the mentor or have an inside joke, something tiny like a coffee, sticker, or rubber duck can work. But skip expensive or personal gifts‚Äîkeep it simple and light-hearted.

**What other Redditors say:**

‚ÄúI gave my boss a 3D-printed duck‚Äîwe always joked about it.‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt gift anything of real value‚Äîit can seem like a conflict of interest.‚Äù

# 4. It‚Äôs not always seen as ‚Äúgifting up‚Äù

In industries like tech, creative fields, or academia, the line between senior and junior can be more relaxed. That means wishing someone a happy birthday‚Äîeven someone above you‚Äîisn‚Äôt seen as sucking up. It‚Äôs just being polite and human.

**What other Redditors say:**

‚ÄúA senior engineer is just another coworker‚Äînot your manager.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all under the same lead, so a card isn‚Äôt weird at all.‚Äù

# Best for:

* Interns who want to show appreciation  
* Employees with mentors who‚Äôve been supportive  
* Friendly or collaborative work environments  
* Moments when you genuinely want to say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù  

# ¬†Bottom Line:

If your workplace feels friendly and your mentor has made a positive impact on you, go ahead and wish them a happy birthday. A simple, thoughtful card or warm message is more than enough‚Äîit‚Äôs respectful, appreciated, and can mean a lot.

You‚Äôre not doing too much by saying **‚Äúthank you‚Äù with kindness.** Just keep it sincere and low-key, and you‚Äôre good to go.

Let me know if you‚Äôve ever given (or received) a great mentor birthday wish! Would love to hear what worked for you.",1,1754352069.0,GiftRecommendations,0,1.0,False

[https://www.reddit.com/r/StockOptionCoffeeShop/comments/1m5v8cx/rolling\_short\_calls\_atthemoney\_atm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockOptionCoffeeShop/comments/1m5v8cx/rolling_short_calls_atthemoney_atm/)

Perhaps to shed some light on the two approaches: ""only roll for a net credit"" versus ""there's nothing inherently wrong with rolling for a debit""...

If you hear someone advocate only rolling for a credit, their investment objective may likely be capital preservation plus the generation of current positive cash flow (or they unfortunately learned from someone who didn't express an alternate viewpoint for capital growth). Think someone retired running a conservative version of the wheel and using premiums to pay their monthly bills.

Rolling for a debit is more for those who are interested in long term total gains -- premiums + capital gains -- and they're willing to forgo the current positive cash flow for that potential. If you follow the ""roll for a net credit"" folks closely, when assigned a stock via a cash secured put, they often want to get rid of that stock, quickly.

I would hazard a guess that most 20 year olds, 30 year old, 40 year olds, and even many 50 year olds are more interested in long term total gains (i.e., capital growth). They may be trading stocks like NVDA or PLTR (where the conservative wheeler may consider NVDA ""is more of a meme stock"") and the last thing they want to do is ""get rid of that stock, quickly"". They likely aren't withdrawing premiums received to pay their monthly bills (or if they are, they may be running a small conservative wheel for that purpose).

Having said that, perhaps a 30 year old individual brand new to options, or someone with a small account, may wish to take the more conservative approach as they start, and then evolve their skillset as they learn/grow their account.

For those with sufficient financial resources and looking for long term capital growth potential, however, if you have the ""only roll for a net credit"" rule pounded into your head, you may wish to reconsider your strategy.

***Bigger Picture Takeaways:***

1. With options trading in general, there are few (if any) hard rules. One approach may be appropriate in a certain context, and the opposite approach may be appropriate in a different context.
2. Be very careful when you hear someone say something like, ""the rule is..."" as it a) is perhaps coming from a place where they lack awareness of other contexts and b) their entire foundation of advice may be built on such a framework.

I've buried them in the scrubland behind the house. I've burnt them in a fireplace. I've tried tearing them up and throwing them into the sea. Once, I even locked them inside a lead box that I had a blacksmith seal for me. It vanished from the shelf the following week. Two days later, I found a new letter. It was in my pocket, folded into quarters, with my name handwritten on the front. My old name. The one I haven't used since I moved here.

You don't have to believe me. I don't expect you to. I wouldn't believe it either if someone told me something like this. But after six years, I've stopped trying to understand. The truth is, it all started with just one letter. A small, unaddressed envelope that appeared amongst the archive boxes at Carstairs Library, in Yorkshire.

It was my first month as an archivist there. The library was enormous, quiet, and far too old for today's world. The corridors seemed like passages from a time that no longer existed. And that day, someone left an envelope with my name on my desk. No one called me, no one warned me. The envelope was just there. That was it.

I thought it was some formal request for digitisation or cataloguing ‚Äì something normal for the role. But when I opened it, there was no technical sheet. It was a long, handwritten letter, describing in detail the murder of a woman. Her name, her clothes, the exact place where she'd be found, and even the time of death. The author didn't say who they were, only described everything as if it were a script. The letter ended with a phrase: ""Now you know. What will you do with it?""

At the time, I thought it was some sort of morbid prank. Something left by a former employee. Perhaps a forgotten play. But three days later, the police found the body of a red-haired woman on the tracks of the disused Brackley Moor station ‚Äì exactly as described in the letter.

That's where it all began. And that's where I made the mistake of not throwing the letter away. I should have ignored it. I should have left that town that very day. But instead, I read the next one.

\*\*\*

When I accepted the position at Carstairs Library, I thought I was starting my life over. It was a rare opportunity, the kind you don't find just by looking. An institution over 300 years old, deep in the English countryside, needing someone to reorganise its historical archives, digitise ancient documents, and handle private donations. For someone like me ‚Äì quiet, methodical, accustomed to dust and small print ‚Äì it was almost romantic. The world outside was moving too fast. I needed silence. And Yorkshire offered me exactly that.

I rented a cottage a few miles from the town. Modest, secluded, with a real fireplace and a wooden fence that creaked in the wind. The village was small. Two main streets, three caf√©s, a grocer, and a pub that only opened on Friday nights. People spoke little, but they were polite. Even smiling. The kind of place where the postman still calls you by name and neighbours actually listen to the radio.

The library sat atop a hill, surrounded by ancient trees that seemed older than the books themselves. It was a dark stone building with narrow windows, and inside, the scent of wood, paper, and damp permeated everything. I arrived early every day. Work was my refuge. I catalogued manuscripts, checked systems, prepared boxes for digitisation. Sometimes, I'd go the entire day without seeing another human being. And that, for me, was a bonus.

Over time, I realised no one mentioned the previous librarian. Not the cleaning staff, nor the volunteers who occasionally showed up for events. When I asked, they'd change the subject or pretend not to hear. One older lady even told me that ""time swallows those who stay too long in there."" She chuckled afterwards. I thought it was just British humour.

There were small things that bothered me, but I brushed them off. The way the clocks always seemed to be running late. The fact that documents were never where I'd left them. Or that some archive names would appear in the system and then vanish, as if they'd never existed. I attributed it all to the age of the building, the antiquated system, and my own adjustment. After all, everything seemed to work out fine by the end of the day. The sense of strangeness dissolved amidst hot tea and yellowed paper.

But the truth was, there was an emptiness inside. Not an emptiness of silence, but of a real absence. As if something important was missing. As if the walls concealed an unnamed absence that felt heavy. The library was too large for the few staff. Too quiet, even for an isolated place. Some wings were always closed, supposedly for renovations. But I never saw anyone working in them.

The routine, despite everything, continued. In the morning, tea. Then, archives. In the afternoon, digitisation. In the evening, a random book and a leisurely dinner. I grew accustomed to the solitude. I liked it. And that's precisely why I didn't perceive the danger when it arrived. Because it arrived slowly, like everything else there. Without a sound, without knocking on the door.

It was just an envelope on my desk, one ordinary morning, enveloped by a silence I'd come to consider normal.

\*\*\*

The morning it all began, it was drizzling. I remember it well, because the windowpane was fogged up and the sound of the rain on the roof gave me a false sense of security. The library was still empty. I arrived early as always, switched on the lights in the archives section, and made my tea. When I sat down at my desk, the envelope was already there.

It was white, with no sender, no stamp. Simple. It looked like an internal memo.

Except no one left correspondence on that floor ‚Äì reception was on the ground floor, and I worked three floors up, in the section reserved for special collections. It was rare for anyone to come up there. I was, in practice, the only one responsible for the library's physical archives. I thought about asking the receptionist, but the envelope was already there, before me, and my curiosity was stronger.

Inside was a folded sheet, handwritten. Neat, firm script, unhurried. An old-fashioned, almost calligraphic hand. The letter described a crime. It didn't use the term ""murder,"" nor did it give legal context. It was simply a meticulous account of what was about to happen. The author wrote as if witnessing the scene. It spoke of a woman, red hair, early thirties. It described the floral dress, the steps she took in the rain, the sound of the phantom train on the abandoned tracks of Brackley Moor. It said she would fall, that the impact would be dry, and that no one would find her for two days.

The letter ended with the phrase that still echoes in my head to this day:

""Now you know. What will you do with it?""

For a moment, I stood still for a few seconds. The letter trembled slightly between my fingers. Was it a joke? Some kind of literary exercise? A forgotten excerpt from a novel? But why address it to me? Why without context?

I put the paper in my drawer. At midday, I went down for lunch and discreetly asked the receptionist if anyone had left correspondence for me. She said no. That no one had gone up to that floor since the previous Friday.

I returned to my desk, uneasy. I recalled the details of the letter and decided to look for information on my own. I searched for ""Brackley Moor"" ‚Äì a name I didn't know ‚Äì and discovered it was an old railway station, disused for decades and isolated in the middle of nowhere. No recent news, no planned events. Nothing.

I thought about forgetting the whole thing. But the letter had unsettled me in a way I couldn't explain. There was something in the tone, the precision of the words, that took my breath away. At the end of the day, I took the envelope home. I left it on the mantelpiece, as if trying to decide what to do.

Two days later, I heard the news on the radio.

It was early morning, and I was making coffee. The radio presenter sounded odd, hesitant. He was talking about a woman's body found in Brackley Moor. Red hair, floral dress. Death by head trauma. Probable fall. No signs of a struggle.

I nearly dropped the mug.

I picked up the letter and re-read every line. It was all there. Every damn detail. I stood still for almost an hour, unsure what to think. I tried to rationalise it. Maybe I'd heard the news first and then confused the timings. Maybe I was suggestible. Maybe it was all just a coincidence. But deep down, something in me already knew. I just didn't want to accept it.

The following week, another letter arrived.

This time, it spoke of a man. Thirty-nine years old. Walking across the stone bridge near Washmere Lake. The letter described his anguish, his weariness, his vacant gaze before he jumped. The text was cold, almost too descriptive, as if written by someone who wasn't judging the act ‚Äì just narrating with precision.

Three days later, the body was found.

I started having trouble sleeping. The library was no longer a refuge, but a place where the next warning might be waiting for me at any moment. I began checking my desk before I even took off my coat. Every morning, my hands trembled slightly. I still hadn't told anyone. Part of me still believed I could stop it, that it was only a matter of time until an explanation appeared.

But each new letter pushed me further away from reality. And what scared me most... was that they were becoming more personal.

\*\*\*

The letters didn't stop. On the contrary ‚Äì they started arriving at shorter intervals. The pattern seemed to follow an invisible logic, like a pulse that kept quickening. At first, it was one a week. Then, every five days. Three. Sometimes two on the same day. All followed the same style: exact, objective descriptions, but with a subtle touch of judgement, as if the author wasn't just reporting ‚Äì but expecting me to do something.

I began keeping them all in a locked box, hidden in the digitisation room cupboard. I still hoped that one day I could hand everything over to the police at once. But I didn't know how to explain what I had. The letters had no postmark, no physical proof of origin. They were ordinary sheets of paper, folded into quarters. And each new crime described in them... came to pass.

I tried to confront reality with logic. I printed old news articles, verified names, searched for connections between the victims. Nothing. No apparent link. Different ages, different locations, random occupations. The only common thread was the time between the letters and the murders: always three days.

I mentioned this vaguely to a police officer, as if doing academic research.

He listened politely, said that coincidences sometimes seem more important than they are, and that without real proof there wasn't much they could do. It was what I feared. Saying more would be risking my job ‚Äì and perhaps my freedom. After all, I was the only one with advance access to the descriptions of the crimes. The only one with a collection of letters that seemed to predict each one of them.

I began to wonder if I wasn't creating it all myself. Was I reading the letters, forgetting, and committing the crimes in some dissociative state? I started recording my nights, using a hidden camera in my room, timing my journeys from home to work. I never deviated from the pattern. No absences, no lapses in time. But the doubt remained. And once it entered, it never left.

Small things started to go missing in the library. A locked cupboard that appeared unlocked in the morning. An 1892 manuscript that moved shelves on its own. A smell of smoke coming from the closed section, where there was no electricity. I wrote everything down. I took photos. I showed them to a colleague who appeared on Fridays ‚Äì but he just laughed. He said the building was old and did these things. ""Perhaps you're hearing the whispers of the collection,"" he joked. But it wasn't a joke.

One morning, I arrived and found a letter on the floor of the meeting room. Not on my desk, but on the carpet, under the chair where I always sat. How did it get there? The library was locked. I had the only key to the section. And even if someone had got in ‚Äì why leave the letter on the floor? Why put it there and not anywhere else? It was a staged scene. A message. But for what? And from whom?

The inconsistencies began to pile up. In one of the digital files I'd scanned myself, there was an image I didn't remember saving. A blurred, black-and-white photograph of a man standing in front of the library, holding an envelope. His face was partially covered by shadow, but there was something in his posture that reminded me of someone. It took me two days to remember. Until I realised the coat he was wearing was the same one I wore in winter.

Another time, I received an anonymous call on the library phone. When I answered, I only heard a faint breath. Nothing else. When I hung up, the phone rang again. I answered. The same breath. Third time. Breath, followed by a subtle sound ‚Äì something like paper being folded. When I tried to trace the calls using the reception panel, they weren't in the log. The receptionist swore no one had used the line at that time.

The world around me began to fragment.

A library volunteer called me ""Mr. Hastings"" one day ‚Äì a name that wasn't mine. When I corrected her, she became confused and said that's what they called him before. Before what? She couldn't explain. She just apologised and left. The next day, she didn't show up again. No one spoke about it.

One October afternoon, I walked through town to clear my head. On the way, I saw a mural with old posters. One of them caught my eye. It was for a missing person: man, 34 years old, dark eyes, archivist. The date on the poster was three years ago.

I ran to it, tore off the poster, and kept it with me. I tried to find the place it came from, but couldn't. The caf√© next door said they'd never seen that mural. An old man across the street said the board was for theatre announcements and no one had used it for years.

And at that moment, I knew for certain: either the world was falling apart around me... or I was the only one who perceived how it truly was.

\*\*\*

It took me time to accept that I couldn't solve it alone. I tried to list all logical possibilities: that someone was playing a trick on me, that it was an elaborate hoax, that there was a group persecuting me for some unknown reason. Even the hypothesis of losing my sanity seemed more plausible than accepting that all of this was real.

I began to investigate the library's own records. I had access to historical archives, local newspapers, microfilms, old crime reports. I scoured decades of information looking for any clue. And I soon noticed something that had escaped me before.

This pattern of letters ‚Äì premonitory, precise, impersonal ‚Äì wasn't new.

I found fragmented mentions in 19th-century reports. In 1886, a librarian named Thomas Hargreaves had recorded in his personal diary that he was receiving letters describing accidents before they happened. He cited fires, drownings, suicides. The documents were vague, handwritten, and unidentifiable, but the pattern was identical: three days between the letter and the event.

Hargreaves disappeared in 1887.

The following year, another employee ‚Äì this time an assistant ‚Äì reported in unsent letters that ""the words were starting to appear in the books."" He said he'd read reports and found messages between the lines, names and places he'd never written. He was institutionalised that summer and died six months later, with no clear diagnosis.

That shook me.

These men had gone through exactly what I was going through. And all of them disappeared, or died, or went mad. Still, part of me felt a strange relief. I wasn't alone. This wasn't an invention of my mind. It was an old story, rooted in that place, perhaps even in that profession. I began to see the library as an organism ‚Äì not just a building, but a receptacle of forgotten things, of patterns that repeat in silence.

With that line of reasoning, I decided to look for larger patterns. I took a map of Yorkshire and marked the locations where the crimes had occurred. I used the details from the letters to get approximate coordinates. It took a while, but when I finished... I froze.

The points formed a drawing. Not exactly a recognisable figure, but a shape ‚Äì an incomplete circle. There was a repetition, a rhythm, as if the murders were following a geometric order.

Four points were missing to close the outline. What if this was some kind of ritual? An invocation? Not in a mystical sense, perhaps, but in the sense of a cycle, a structure that needed to be completed. Each death, a piece. Each letter, a summons. The library was the centre.

The theory seemed absurd. But why would someone write detailed letters about real crimes before they happened? And why did they always come to me? Me, specifically? I started listing more radical hypotheses. What if I was being used by something that understood time differently? What if the letters were written by an entity outside our linear time? A consciousness that merely observes... and records?

I returned to the archives and found something even stranger.

A manuscript dated 1794 described the legend of a being locally known as The Letter Whisperer. According to the text, it was an invisible presence that ""murmurs the end before the beginning,"" and chooses a human messenger to serve as a link. The account was vague, but spoke of a library that ""silently holds the truth of the future"" and of ""words that walk before footsteps.""

It was too much of a coincidence.

I started trying to understand who else knew about this. I discreetly asked other staff about Hargreaves, about the 1887 assistant. Everyone evaded the questions. Most had never heard of them. And those who had looked at me as if I'd said something I shouldn't have.

I sent emails to nearby universities. I tried to contact scholars of local history, authors of articles on regional folklore. No response. Some emails bounced back. Others seemed to have been read but ignored. A single historian replied, but his message was strange. He said:

""If you have received the letters, you are already in. Stopping now is not an option. Document. Record everything. But do not try to understand it. That is what it wants.""

The message was deleted a minute later. I couldn't reply.

From then on, the glitches began to infiltrate every aspect of my routine.

My photos disappeared from my phone. Some returned later, with alterations. In one of them, taken in the archives room, there was a figure standing in the corner ‚Äì dark, diffuse, almost invisible, but present. In another, my expression was wrong. I was smiling, but I didn't remember smiling. It was a smile... out of place.

I started writing notes to myself. ""Today is Tuesday."" ""Your name is still Elliot."" ""You are awake."" Simple things, just to maintain my sanity. But sometimes I found the notes with letters swapped. As if another version of me had rewritten them.

Rationality was crumbling. But that's what it wanted, wasn't it? To push me little by little. To make me doubt myself. I couldn't give in. Not yet. There was something there, something that needed to be discovered. I felt it with every fibre of my being. And the strangest thing... was that I also felt it was waiting.

As if it knew that, at some point, I would become part of the writing too.

\*\*\*

That morning, I woke up on the library floor.

I was lying among cardboard boxes, with no memory of how I got there. The lights were off, the door locked from the inside, and my coat was still wet from the previous night's rain. But I didn't remember the rain. Nor leaving home. There was a haze in my thoughts, as if the last twelve hours had been carefully erased ‚Äì not torn out, just gently removed, like a page ripped from an old diary.

I slowly got up. My back ached. My hands were stained with ink ‚Äì not printer or stamp ink, but pen ink, dark blue, deep. It was on my fingers, on my palms, on my sleeves. And all around me... letters. Many of them. Scattered on the floor, on tables, spilling from drawers. Folded letters, open letters, old and new letters. I recognised the handwriting. It was the same. Always the same.

And it was mine.

Each envelope had my name. And inside, the details. The victims' names. The locations. The descriptions. The times. Future dates. Some that had already passed. Others that were yet to come. A sea of potential deaths, all written by a hand I didn't remember moving. I picked up one of the random letters.

It described a car accident. A bearded man, driving down a foggy road, losing control on a bend. I remembered the news story. It happened two weeks earlier. But I hadn't written that. I swore I hadn't.

I rushed to my computer. I tried to access the security cameras. Nothing. The system was empty. The video files had vanished. I went back to the archives room. Now it was different. The shelves seemed reorganised. The books were out of order ‚Äì not alphabetically, not chronologically. When I looked more closely, I realised: the titles were organised by dates of assassinations.

And beneath each title, an author's name. My name. As if I had written every one of those accounts. As if they were my works. Each murder archived as a publication. Each death... a chapter.

Something inside me broke.

I ran downstairs, looking for anyone. Anyone at all. But the building was empty. Silent. The windows were dark, as if it were night, even though I had woken up to sunlight. I went to the main door. Locked. I locked and unlocked it several times. Nothing. It was as if it was sealed from the inside. I peered through the gaps. Outside, everything was still. No cars, no people, not even wind. A heavy, artificial silence. As if the world outside had been paused. As if only I were running... inside a cardboard set.

Then I heard it. Footsteps. Coming from upstairs.

Slow, regular footsteps. A muffled sound of old shoes on the wooden floorboards. I climbed slowly, compelled by an instinct I didn't understand. The footsteps stopped. Reaching the top step, I saw a childlike figure, standing at the end of the corridor. A girl with black hair, pale skin, dark eyes. She held an envelope. She didn't seem frightened. Not alive. Just... there.

""It's your turn to write,"" she said.

Her voice didn't match her age. It was older, drier. A voice of old age canned in a young body. She held out the envelope. I didn't want to touch it, but my hand moved on its own. I took the paper. It was blank. But when I opened it... the words began to appear on their own. As if something invisible was writing on the other side.

My name. My address. Today's date.

And the cause of death: mental collapse due to continuous exposure to the truth.

I dropped the letter and ran. I didn't know where to. Each room seemed identical to the last. Each corridor repeated itself. It was like walking inside a book that folded its pages as you read. Everything was familiar, but always wrong. When I finally found the emergency staircase, it led up... and up... and up. It never ended.

I don't know how long I was trapped there. Hours? Days?

At some point, I fell. Or perhaps I passed out. When I woke up, I was outside. Lying in the library's front garden, my coat torn and my eyes burning from lack of sleep. The door was open. People were walking along the street, as if nothing had happened.

The world had returned to normal.

But the letter was still in my pocket.

\*\*\*

After that day, I left the library. I didn't resign. I didn't hand back my keys. I simply walked away. I walked home like a zombie, the letter still in my pocket and the feeling that the world was watching me from the edges of time. I spent three days lying on the sofa, with the curtains drawn. The letters stopped. No new ones arrived. For the first time in months, the silence felt real.

I thought I had won.

I truly believed it was over. That the cycle had closed with me, and that by not reading, I had broken the chain. I began to rebuild my routine. I started sleeping more often. I cooked warm meals, read old books that didn't speak of death. Reality seemed more solid. Things had weight again.

It was in this time of calm that I realised what had truly happened.

The library wasn't the beginning. It was just a station. A point of contact. Whatever was behind the letters, the premonitions, the murders ‚Äì it wasn't human. It wasn't a person, nor a group, nor a cult. It was a consciousness. Something that moved through stories, through records, through narrative patterns that repeat across centuries. A parasite of reality, perhaps. An invisible author that feeds on chronologies, that uses words to shape what is to come. And for that... it needs someone to write.

And there lay my biggest suspicion, and perhaps my only truth: I was chosen not because I was special, but because I was predictable.

My profile, my organised mind, my love for archives, my solitude ‚Äì everything about me was ideal to serve as an intermediary. I was the kind of man who doesn't question the rules while they're organised. And when they start to fail, he tries to fix them, even when there's no way to. Such a man doesn't resist. He merely records.

This thought filled me with dread. But also a kind of peace. For the first time, I understood my role. I wasn't the victim. I was the narrator. I always have been. The one who documents, who preserves, who gives form to the cycle.

There was only one way out: to break with the function.

So, I burned everything. The letters, the files, the maps. I deleted digital files, formatted hard drives, destroyed records I had hidden. I burned my coat. I tore up every paper with my name on it. Even personal documents. I wanted to erase myself. To disconnect from the function. To become nobody again.

And for a while, it worked.

I moved town. Changed my name. Cut contact with everything. I started living from temporary jobs, in silence. I never stayed too long in one place. I never told anyone. I never wrote about it. Until now.

Because this morning, a new letter arrived.

It was on my bed. Even with the windows locked, even with the door closed. Even with no one knowing who I am, or where I am. A white envelope. Neat handwriting.

And this time, there was no crime description.

Just one sentence: ""You've started writing again, Elliot.""

\*\*\*

I put the letter in a locked drawer. But I couldn't ignore it. For hours, I sat at the table, staring into nothing, trying to understand how it reached me. There was no explanation. No sign of a break-in. No print. Just that white envelope, waiting. As if it knew I wouldn't resist my curiosity.

I tried to go about my day. I went for a walk, bought groceries, chatted with a shop assistant about the weather. Everything seemed normal. But upon returning home, I found a new envelope. This time, on my pillow. It was sealed. Nothing written on the outside. No sentence inside.

Just a blank sheet of paper. As if it were waiting for me to fill it. I didn't sleep that night. Nor the following ones.

I started hearing noises inside the walls ‚Äì the sound of something scratching, not from outside, but from within the house's structure. Indistinct voices, as if someone was whispering words before I brought them to conscious thought. Sometimes, I see reflections that don't mirror me. My own gestures arriving a second later. My shadow turning its face when my back is to it.

I thought it was paranoia. But then I noticed something worse. The letters started arriving at other houses.

First, a neighbour commented on a ""strange"" letter that appeared on their porch, with no sender. Then, I heard children talking about envelopes ""appearing out of nowhere."" An old man across the street put up a new post box and, the next day, destroyed it with an axe.

I understood too late. I wasn't the last messenger.

I was just the first to write clearly enough to reopen the trail. The words were loose now. The cycle no longer needed me. It had learned to multiply. And all that was left for me... was to observe. As I always have.

Today, I found a new letter on the front door. Different from the others. It was thin, with golden edges. In the centre, just one sentence, precisely printed:

""The next one has already begun.""

The envelope was open.

**TLDR: We built a handy little app to make your Irish Rail and LUAS journeys a bit less of a pain. This commuter companion app tracks trains for you and wakes you up before your stop. Free on iOS and Android.** [**Download here**](https://chunkytofustudios.com/dozy/)**.**

\-----

I take the train a couple of times a week, usually heading home late in the evening feeling wrecked. I started setting an alarm so I could grab a quick nap on the way and arrive home a bit more human and actually enjoy the evenings. But sure the t**rains kept getting delayed, so the alarm would go off way too early**.

And then in the mornings, **I'd leg it down to the stop only to find the train had been cancelled**. Could‚Äôve taken me time with a proper coffee if I‚Äôd just known...



So, I got together with a few mates and we built an app ‚Äì it‚Äôs called **Dozy**.

It‚Äôs basically a smart alarm for public transport. It **auto-magically figures out what train you‚Äôre on and sets a GPS alarm to go off when you‚Äôre nearly at your stop**. It‚Äôs based on location, not time ‚Äì so you‚Äôre not constantly checking the map or worrying you‚Äôll miss your station. Just chill or get a bit of work done.



We‚Äôve packed in a few handy features too:

‚Ä¢ **Irish Rail** and **LUAS** integration

‚Ä¢ Live train tracking so you know where you are and what the ETA is

‚Ä¢ Timetables on the home screen that show you the next train for your usual route

‚Ä¢ Trip sharing with mates & family

‚Ä¢ Real-time service alerts

‚Ä¢ Battery friendly, uses about 4% per hour (way less than the usual GPS stuff)

  
It‚Äôs built to be reliable too, because otherwise what‚Äôs the point?

‚Ä¢ Lost signal? Alarm goes off a bit early in case the train speeds up

‚Ä¢ Battery nearly dead? It wakes you immediately

‚Ä¢ App crashes? There‚Äôs a backup alarm at the operating system level that still rings



And don‚Äôt worry, the alarm won‚Äôt annoy anyone around you. It **starts off as a vibration, and only gets louder if you don‚Äôt dismiss it**.



It‚Äôs a side project we‚Äôve poured loads of time into, and now we‚Äôd love to hear what you think:

‚Ä¢ Would this sort you out on your commute?

‚Ä¢ Anything you reckon we could improve?

‚Ä¢ Any feedback on the design, usability, or features?



PS: I commute between NYC and New Jersey myself, but two of the lads are based in Dublin; so we know the hassle the Irish Rail causes on the daily. We‚Äôre planning to roll out to more areas soon too.



Thanks a million for reading ‚Äì and fair play if you give it a go!

1mhtnpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TRUE_Neville_Goddard/comments/1mhtnpj/nevilles_most_important_paragraph/,Neville‚Äôs most important paragraph,"You read Neville‚Äôs books and lecture transcripts and you find a lot of wisdom. This is not just his wisdom; it‚Äôs the wisdom of the entire New Thought movement but nobody captured it better than Neville. Of everything he said, and I went through everything many times, if I had to single out one paragraph, it would be this one and you‚Äôll find it towards the end of his early book, *Your Faith Is Your Fortune* (1941):

>You cannot force anything outwardly by the mightiest effort of the will. There is only one way you can command the things you want and that is by assuming the consciousness of the things desired. There is a vast difference between feeling a thing and merely knowing it intellectually. You must accept without reservation the fact that by possessing (feeling) a thing in consciousness you have commanded the reality that causes it to come into existence in concrete form. You must be absolutely convinced of an unbroken connection between the invisible reality and its visible manifestation. Your inner acceptance must become an intense, unalterable conviction which transcends both reason and intellect, renouncing entirely any belief in the reality of the externalization except as a reflection of an inner state of consciousness. When you really understand and believe these things, you will have built up so profound a certainty that nothing can shake you.

Let me break it down for you and explain why I find this paragraph remarkable:

>You cannot force anything outwardly by the mightiest effort of the will. There is only one way you can command the things you want and that is by assuming the consciousness of the things desired.

People try to achieve things by taking massive action from the outside. There‚Äôs this misconception that the more you work, the more you accomplish. You don‚Äôt need to work hard, you need to work smart. And if you want to succeed, you must become in your consciousness the person you want to be before taking any action on the outside. You must identify with your goal, as I will explain in a future post this Fall. That‚Äôs really the first crucial point to understand about manifesting. If you don‚Äôt identify with your goal, you‚Äôre just day dreaming in your imagination and no amount of techniques and routines will help you.

>There is a vast difference between feeling a thing and merely knowing it intellectually.

You can read books about the Law and you can understand the theory, but that‚Äôs not enough. That‚Äôs only surface acceptance. So many people claim they believe the Law is real, but then when they manifest something they start asking ‚Äúwhere tf is it?‚Äù like Neville telling Abdullah ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no movement; where is my ticket to Barbados?‚Äù You can‚Äôt feel something is true unless you experience it. First you experience it in your imagination until it feels natural, then it materializes and you experience the result of the law in action.

>You must accept without reservation the fact that by possessing (feeling) a thing in consciousness you have commanded the reality that causes it to come into existence in concrete form. You must be absolutely convinced of an unbroken connection between the invisible reality and its visible manifestation. Your inner acceptance must become an intense, unalterable conviction which transcends both reason and intellect, renouncing entirely any belief in the reality of the externalization except as a reflection of an inner state of consciousness.

These are the most categorical sentences ever stated by Neville in his entire career. He basically leaves no error margin, not because there‚Äôs actually no error margin, but because he really wants to make this point very clear and powerful. You can‚Äôt just parrot his statements ‚Äúimagining creates reality‚Äù or ‚Äúevery physical effect in this world has a spiritual cause and not a natural.‚Äù These notions need subconscious acceptance. You can‚Äôt have hidden doubts about it, just like if today is Monday you don‚Äôt secretly worry that maybe tomorrow isn‚Äôt Tuesday. You need to reach the point where you see the outside world as a mere projection of our collective consciousness. It‚Äôs not a real world of causality, it is a world of effects and that‚Äôs why Neville called it a ‚Äúshadow world.‚Äù You must believe that deeply, not just declare it because it sounds cool.

>When you really understand and believe these things you will have built up so profound a certainty that nothing can shake you.

In the same book Neville said ‚Äúa conviction is not a conviction if it can be shaken.‚Äù You can‚Äôt rely on the Law unless you achieve a complete acceptance of its guiding principles as explained above. That‚Äôs why most people can manifest free coffee and other unimportant things, but fail when they work on something that actually matters to them. When everything is said and done, the reason for their failure is always the same: they don‚Äôt really believe in the Law. Their anxiety, their fear, the importance they place on their goals is always higher than their confidence in the Law. This is a mathematical formula based on energy. It‚Äôs not Neville‚Äôs black & white description in this paragraph, but it is still one where the strength of your belief must supersede the strength of your obstacles. And in the end Neville is right: the strongest belief is one that is unshakable.

>If you do not have wisdom, ask God for it. He is always ready to give it to you and will never say you are wrong for asking. But ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. For that person must not suppose that a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways will receive anything from the Lord (James 1:5-8).",9,1754351015.0,TRUE_Neville_Goddard,1,1.0,False

About a month ago, I saw my ex-girlfriend for the first time since we broke up ‚Äî after 6 months of complete no contact. I was the one who reached out and invited her for a coffee. She agreed, but made it clear from the start that she saw it as a friendly meet-up. I respected that boundary and kept the tone light, cordial, and surface-level. We didn‚Äôt talk about the past or our feelings ‚Äî just small talk, really.

But ever since that meeting, something‚Äôs been gnawing at me.

I‚Äôve been noticing subtle things on her social media that feel‚Ä¶ emotionally charged. Posts that seem to carry hidden meanings, at least to me. For example, she posted a review on Letterboxd (my favorite social media) of The Notebook (I know ‚Äî classic), and simply wrote: ‚ÄúFeeling emotional ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π‚Äù.
And beyond that, she‚Äôs been sharing Instagram stories with songs that have emotionally heavy or nostalgic lyrics ‚Äî often about heartbreak, regret, or longing.

I‚Äôm fully aware that I might be reading way too much into this. But still, I can‚Äôt help but wonder: why now? Why, after months of silence, these specific types of posts ‚Äî right after we saw each other?

Has anyone here experienced something similar? An ex seemingly sending ‚Äúcoded‚Äù messages online after a long period of silence?

""You're trusting end users again?""

Noted.

I just finished my coffee and was deep in Entra Connect trying to un-break a sync conflict involving duplicate UPNs (because apparently that's fine now by Microsoft's standards), when I got the email.

It's from Kaylee.

She's confused because our MFA app did something unusual and... asked for camera access. She literally said, ""It seems‚Ä¶ sketchy?""

Mm-hmm. It's a QR code, Kaylee. That's what it does.

It uses the camera. To scan the code. To enroll the device. To complete the setup.

To log you in.

She doesn't like it. She doesn't want work stuff on her personal phone despite using the same phone for Outlook, Adobe, and probably some very aggressive Teams reactions.

So she proposes this instead: ""Could you issue me a company phone for this?""

Because, obviously, the solution to avoiding a 3-second camera permission is to hand her a corporate asset, enroll it in MDM, track it, secure it, and support it just so she can receive login prompts.

Okay, let's recap:

She doesn't want to scan the code. She doesn't want the app on her phone. She wants a corporate phone instead.

She's proposing full lifecycle device support to avoid a standard enrollment screen.

I explained -- calmly, and once -- that this isn't Microsoft Authenticator. It's a proprietary app, required by the system we use, and it does not support numeric code entry as an alternate method. The QR scan is the only option. It's a technical limitation.

And then she asked:

""Could you just, like‚Ä¶ read the QR squares and tell me what to type in?""

Sure.

Let me just pause the dozens of high-priority tasks I'm actively triaging to manually decode a visual cryptographic handshake, all so you don‚Äôt have to interact with your phone.

Kaylee, we are not in a choose-your-own-authentication reality. I mentioned FIDO to her and she literally asked how a dog could help me stay safe, but in a ""technical environment.""

Holy shit.

We don't issue phones for vibes. This is MFA. Not a luxury resort check-in.

You want a device policy? Here it is:

Use your phone. Use the app. Scan the code. Done.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll be going back to stopping your Entra ID object from duplicating itself (again) so I can pretend to work on your problem tomorrow when you inevitably call me.

  
EDIT: Just to clarify, no one is being forced to use their personal device. Some of you clearly missed this: the user is already voluntarily using their phone for work... Outlook, Teams, Adobe, etc. They also signed a BYOD agreement during onboarding, which outlines expectations around secure access and MFA.

**LETS GO**

I was in the IB program until I dropped out early junior year. Technically, I never fully escaped it ‚Äî most of my classes were tagged as AP/IB hybrids, and the alternative (""standard"") classes felt like chaos with a bell schedule. So I stuck around the edge of the beast.

This is written from the perspective of a middle-income (maximum stretch), heteronormative, mostly Caucasian male, someone who always felt like the unacknowledged villain of the classroom narrative. That sense hasn‚Äôt faded ‚Äî in fact, friends of mine who now teach in the IB system tell me it‚Äôs only gotten worse. 

I‚Äôm a bit on the spectrum, which means this comes out in a slightly chaotic, stream-of-consciousness format. But hey ‚Äî at least you're not trying to read my handwriting.

A few of the books I reference may have come from California junior college courses or personal deep dives, not strictly from the official IB list. My temporal memory is accurate, even if my transcript isn‚Äôt.

This isn‚Äôt a manifesto. It‚Äôs not a cry for help.

It‚Äôs just a long, overdue eye-roll, delivered with wit, venom, and maybe a few actual insights. plus I haven't been motivated to write anything after college. Enjoy! Much of this could just be My school district or program coordinators were heavy on guilt-based enlightenment

What IB Taught Me:

The world has heard enough from people who look like you.

Your role now is to listen, unlearn, self-flagellate, and never speak too confidently ‚Äî or you risk sounding like history‚Äôs villain.

It is the unspoken mission of the International Baccalaureate to grind down your spirit, ambition, and original thought, all within four expertly rubric-aligned years



Literature Summary:



Shakespeare is allowed, but only so students can unpack his toxic masculinity line by iambic line.

Cultural canon-disrupting writers are presented as moral upgrades, not just literary ones.

What I can recall from my 4 years of classes and summer reading assignments is:

15. The Catcher in the Rye J.D. Salinger

A war novel where trying to stay alive proves you're insane, following orders gets people killed, and bureaucracy is the real enemy ‚Äî because nothing says ""heroism"" like being gaslit by your own chain of command while stuck in a loop of existential paperwork. Oh wait this one seems like it slipped through the cracks! Must be why modern school libraries are tossing it.

Lets try how history was taught next.

Colonialism, imperialism, and capitalism treated as uniquely Western diseases, even when non-white empires did the same things earlier and longer.

Revolutions by white men? Oppressive. Revolutions against white men? Glorious.

1. Military Leaders (Alexander, Napoleon, etc.)
History‚Äôs greatest minds reduced to tyrants with daddy issues and horses, but only if they‚Äôre white ‚Äî otherwise, they're visionary freedom fighters.

Two fascist regimes throw punches, but the curriculum makes sure you understand it‚Äôs really Western imperialism‚Äôs fault ‚Äî somehow.

4. Rights and Protest (USA/South Africa)
White men create the problem, then barely help fix it, and still get booed in the textbook for not clapping hard enough.

5. Conflict and Intervention (Rwanda/Kosovo)
A guilt buffet where Western inaction is dissected lovingly, unless we actually did intervene ‚Äî then it was colonialism again.

6. Authoritarian States
A greatest-hits album of angry men with mustaches, most of whom are white unless the class needs more ""diversity in tyranny.""

7. 20th Century Wars
Global death tolls used to remind us that whenever white guys lead armies, it‚Äôs proof of inherent moral rot ‚Äî unlike revolutions, which are brave.

8. Cold War
A 45-year passive-aggressive breakup between white empires, taught like it was all just American paranoia and Soviet hugs.

9. Independence Movements
Colonialism bad (fair), but also: every white male in history should‚Äôve known better, apologized sooner, and died quicker.

10. Democratic States
Look at these brave nations slowly giving people rights ‚Äî and shame on them for not doing it sooner, smoother, or without being male.

11. Industrialization
The story of how white men invented pollution, unions, child labor, and somehow even climate change.

12. Societies in Transition
Men lose power and women get microphones, but don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî the textbooks assure us it‚Äôs not revenge, it‚Äôs justice.



Thankfully I bailed before TOK, but I kept tabs through friends who stuck it out. From everything I gathered, the class should‚Äôve been titled:

Theory of Knowledge: Where Facts Go to Die, and Everything Is Somehow Your Fault If You're European and Male. 

At my school, TOK also meant waking up an hour earlier than necessary for a ‚Äúzero period‚Äù taught by a groggy, overworked teacher who routinely showed up 15 minutes late ‚Äî the perfect embodiment of critical reflection through caffeine withdrawal and institutional irony

CAS Service (or whatever it was called back then)

The academic version of community penance ‚Äî a structured ritual where you‚Äôre expected to pay off karmic debt you didn‚Äôt know you had, armed only with forced smiles, manual labor, and a 500-word reflection essay titled:

‚ÄúI Picked Up Litter and Discovered My Colonial Mindset.‚Äù

Always remember: in IB, service isn‚Äôt about helping ‚Äî it‚Äôs about becoming ‚Äòaware.‚Äô
You‚Äôre not volunteering. You‚Äôre being morally rehabilitated ‚Äî and you better document it on ManageBac.



I've concluded that what IB really teaches you is
How to question everything except the ideology baked into the questioning.
How to cite your pain for points.
How to cry academically, in MLA format.
How to turn guilt into a coherent global perspective.
How to fake purpose through structured burnout.


How the program will treat you:
If you‚Äôre white and male: Deconstruct yourself.
If you‚Äôre not: You are the learning outcome.
If you‚Äôre confident: Reflect harder.
If you‚Äôre struggling: Your resilience is being assessed


Most of all beyond the guilt trips:
Chronic stress builds character. 

College is infinitely easier and more enjoyable than IB expectations by a long shot.


REAL TALK: How to Survive IB, Beat the System, and Actually Win at Life or Further Unsolicited Patriarchal Mansplaining from a Straight-Cis Male.

Advice for Teens Who Aren‚Äôt Drinking the Kool-Aid


Step One: Game the IB ‚Äî Don‚Äôt Worship It

Be polite but unshakable with your parents. Smile, nod, and let them believe the IB Diploma is your golden ticket ‚Äî while you quietly use it as GPA fuel to ride the college app conveyor belt without losing your mind or your soul.

Skip the overpriced IB exams. Take AP exams instead ‚Äî they‚Äôre cheaper, more accepted in U.S. colleges, and can actually earn you credit. Obviously take both if you're going for The Honors Track Nervous Breakdown Bundle‚Ñ¢

Nobody in the U.S. cares about your IB certificate only European universities or a school that fetishizes internationalism.

Do just enough to keep your GPA clean and your parents off your back ‚Äî work the system, don‚Äôt let it work you. A strategic mix of CliffNotes and critical thinking will leave you smarter (and saner) than your sleep-deprived, overachieving peers.



Step Two: Exit the Trap, Enter the Strategy

(This part‚Äôs less about IB and more about the broader agenda of *The System‚Ñ¢* ‚Äî you‚Äôll know it when you feel it.)

Looking back, the smartest move would‚Äôve been:

Drop out after sophomore year. Get your GED. Bail before the machine finishes formatting you into a compliant spreadsheet of test scores and trauma.

If you‚Äôre dead-set on a high school diploma, take the path of least resistance: find your local continuation school, breeze through the condensed coursework, and reclaim your time to further hone your sharp mind for yourself.

 Deep-dive into topics you *actually care about* (AI, philosophy, history, finance, art, etc.) Use platforms like Coursera, Khan Academy, Brilliant, or open courseware from MIT/Harvard. Read books not on school lists ‚Äî especially the banned, obscure, or inconvenient ones. Learn how to regulate your attention, manage your emotions, and develop antifragility. Study philosophy (Stoicism, Taoism, or Gnosticism if you‚Äôre feeling spicy) Practice mindfulness, journaling, or intentional solitude. Skill > Degree > GPA. Learn how to make, sell, or fix something. integrate Skills 

Really its about Creating without waiting for feedback, Mastering your own mind before someone else programs it. Building skills that make you recession-proof, censorship-proof, and soul-proof, and saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to everything that asks you to shrink. The endgame isn‚Äôt success in their system. It‚Äôs sovereignty.

Use your extra time to take community college gen eds for dirt cheap. Transfer them into a 4-year university later.

Avoid life-crippling student debt by front-loading your education with common sense and frugality.

Take a year off if you can. Travel. Work. Backpack. Flip burgers. Suffer a little ‚Äî it's good for clarity. Learn to hate bullshit jobs so you know what you‚Äôre trying to avoid.

Get a credit card early ‚Äî not to spend, but to signal.  
Never buy what you can‚Äôt already afford, and always pay it off in full.  
You‚Äôre not building debt; you‚Äôre building *credibility*.  
A spotless credit history opens doors long before your r√©sum√© does ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôve got dreams bigger than your checking account.


Step Three: Pick a Major That Pays

Don't let school drain your soul for four years of ""self-expression."" Figure out what you can tolerate that also earns money.

STEM, skilled trades, tech, public service careers ‚Äî not ‚Äúaspiring podcaster with $60K debt.‚Äù

Finish that BA or BS once you‚Äôve figured out your leverage. If your goal is to be a teacher start as soon as you can, they want to hire newbies for cheaper, get your schooling afterward and get your higher education pay bumps (and special teacher student loan forgiveness)


Step Four: Income First, Then Smart Moves

Once you‚Äôre making money:

Get in early on scalable tech or industries riding major waves. Stocks, startups, automation, AI, green energy ‚Äî don‚Äôt just consume, invest.

Buy into what your generation obsesses over ‚Äî and hold it for 15 years. Ignore the noise. Don't invest enough to lose your ass until you've learned more.

Avoid shiny crap: New car, luxury apartment, dumb subscriptions. They‚Äôre traps.


Step Five: Lock In a Home Base

Buy a modest place as soon as you can ‚Äî it‚Äôll never be cheaper tomorrow. inflation is constant and BRUTAL
Live near a college or military base = guaranteed renters and future cash flow.
Get roommates now, own the place outright later.


Step Six: Secure the Bag ‚Äî Public Sector Edition

If you want stability: Find a pension-backed, unionized public job.

Low stress, no after-hours nonsense, and legally guaranteed raises and retirement.  
The beauty of seniority-based systems?  
The longer you stay in the game, the more people have to quit, die, or get promoted before *you* have anything to worry about.
A *defined-benefit* plan ‚Äî your pension promises you a fixed monthly income after you retire, based on your salary and years of service. This is guaranteed by the law, the state would have to cease to exist for you to lose it. Many of your peers will lose heavy in poorly managed private company retirement programs.


Step Seven: Never. Stop. Thinking.

Question every power structure ‚Äî old and new.
Learn on your own. Stay curious.
Society wants you docile, debt-ridden, and dependent.
Don‚Äôt be a cog. Be a ghost in the machine. Learn to game it. Learn to break it.
F the system ‚Äî but learn its rules first. Master it. Beat it. Use it to buy your freedom.
This is your life. Don‚Äôt wait for permission to live it on your own terms.
Don‚Äôt hesitate to cut off anyone who drains your energy, wastes your time, or keeps you small ‚Äî no matter who they are.
That includes flaky friends, manipulative partners, and yes, even family members who expect unconditional access to your peace while offering nothing but guilt in return.
Loyalty isn‚Äôt slavery. Love isn‚Äôt a leash.
Sometimes the most radical form of self-respect is walking away ‚Äî and not explaining yourself.

Your choice in a partner is either your greatest asset‚Ä¶ or your biggest liability. Choose like your future depends on it ‚Äî because it does.

1. Look for Alignment, Not Just Attraction Hot fades. Debt doesn‚Äôt. For some sick reason craziness is alluring be cautious and hedge your risks
Shared goals > shared playlists.
If they scoff at your dreams, mock your hustle, or need you to fail so they can feel secure? Run.

2. Red Flags Are Real ‚Äî And Costly
Avoid people who:
Treat victimhood as identity.
Can‚Äôt manage their own money, emotions, or expectations.
Want lifestyle upgrades they didn‚Äôt earn.
Think you owe them a constant emotional performance.

3. Emotional Intelligence > Academic GPA
Find someone who knows how to argue without nuking the room.
Maturity is someone who solves problems ‚Äî not multiplies them for drama points.
Jealousy, passive aggression, manipulation = drain on your mind and wallet.

4. Relationships Are Compound Interest ‚Äî or Compound Regret
A solid partner boosts your focus, your income, and your mental clarity.
The wrong partner drains your time, energy, finances, and years of your life.
Breakups are expensive. Divorces are financial nukes.

5. Never Marry Before You‚Äôre Stable ‚Äî And Only If It‚Äôs Strategic
Marry someone who‚Äôd thrive with or without you ‚Äî not someone looking for a rescue plan.
Protect your assets. Yes, even if it‚Äôs true love.
If you‚Äôre not willing to sign a prenup, you‚Äôre not ready for marriage ‚Äî you‚Äôre ready for regret.

6. Choose Someone Who‚Äôs on Their Own Path
You want a partner, not a dependent or a project.
If their dream is to ‚Äúbe supported‚Äù or ‚Äúbe adored‚Äù ‚Äî keep walking.
Two independent people moving in the same direction >>> codependent soul-mess.

Final Word on Relationships

Love is real ‚Äî but partnership is a strategy.

Pick someone who builds with you, not just someone who wants to be there when the house is finished

On Friends

1. Audit Your Social Circle Like It‚Äôs Your Resume:
Do they inspire you or drain you?
Are they future-focused or still emotionally orbiting high school?
Surround yourself with people who want more ‚Äî not those who want to make sure you don‚Äôt outgrow them.

2. Watch How They Handle Money, Time, and Pressure
If they‚Äôre broke but still buy $9 coffees and vape pens, don‚Äôt follow them anywhere.
If they joke about ""grinding"" but never actually build anything, you‚Äôre being tricked into stagnation with vibes.
Chaos follows some people ‚Äî and you‚Äôll end up paying for it.

3. Smart Friends Make You Smarter
Iron sharpens iron ‚Äî and dull minds make rust.
Good friends challenge your thinking, not your boundaries.
If no one in your circle calls you out when you‚Äôre slipping? You're not growing ‚Äî you‚Äôre babysitting.

4. Don‚Äôt Confuse Proximity for Loyalty
Just because someone has history with you doesn‚Äôt mean they deserve your future.
If they ghost you when you‚Äôre focused or resent you when you‚Äôre winning ‚Äî they were never on your side.
Length of friendship ‚â† quality of friendship. Cut loose accordingly.

5. Avoid These Archetypes Like They‚Äôre Financial STDs
The ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just chill‚Äù guy: Time vampire. Will derail every good habit you try to build.
The perpetual victim: Emotionally manipulative, allergic to accountability.
The gossip engine: If they talk to you about others, they talk about you to others.
The flexer with no assets: Spending money for clout and wondering why he‚Äôs broke.
The angry revolutionary with no plan: All theory, no action, and expects you to burn with them.

6. Grow or Go
Make friends with people better than you in some area.
Build mutual elevation pacts: ‚ÄúWe push each other. We don‚Äôt pull down.‚Äù
Friends who grow together stay together ‚Äî everyone else is a seasonal cameo.



Learn how to get your media, games, and software for free or deeply discounted just by being a student. The long-term savings are massive. Also, learn to meal prep and skip the fast food ‚Äî it‚Äôs the cheapest way to eat well, stay sharp, and keep your wallet from bleeding out daily.

Fast Food is a Financial Parasite:
$10/day = $3,650/year = a year of rent, a vacation, or the down payment you‚Äôll wish you had.
Food is fuel ‚Äî not dopamine therapy with a drive-thru window
You don‚Äôt get rich by working harder ‚Äî you get rich by stopping waste.
The world is forever selling convenience. You‚Äôre building freedom.

Live below your means.
You control your time and resources.
You invest the difference.
And you never wake up one day asking, ‚ÄúWhere did all my money go?‚Äù

Final Rule: Learn Relentlessly. Think Ruthlessly. Move Quietly. Win Loudly.
This whole thing ‚Äî the system, the expectations, the guilt, political theatre ‚Äî it's all just white noise.
Your job is to cut through it. Play along, but don‚Äôt internalize the game.
Build your mind. Stack your skills. Guard your freedom.

Then?
Do what they never expected:

Live well ‚Äî on your own damn terms!

# Apology (Kind of):

I‚Äôd like to formally apologize for committing a series of educational thought crimes ‚Äî including, but not limited to: noticing patterns, questioning dogma, and briefly entertaining the idea that guilt might not be hereditary.

I now understand that critical thinking is only applauded when it arrives at the *pre-approved conclusion*, and that independent learning is acceptable only when it reinforces the assigned worldview.

I regret nothing ‚Äî but I‚Äôm sorry if that makes me problematic.

I acknowledge my failure to fully internalize the worldview expected of me. Instead of unlearning myself, I made the mistake of learning independently.

I questioned assigned texts, disagreed during seminars, and didn‚Äôt perform the correct emotional responses on cue. I understand this violates the spirit of the curriculum.

I will now begin a 500-word reflection ‚Äî double-spaced, MLA format ‚Äî on how I plan to recalibrate my consciousness to meet institutional expectations.",0,1754350277.0,IBO,3,0.3,False

**Reducing Exposure**

These are the sources introducing the most microplastics to people in my opinion

* Single-use plastic water bottle
* Polyester clothing (especially underwear or when heated)
* To-go coffee cups & food containers (especially when heated)
* Plastic cutting boards
* Plastic dental retainers
* Tea bags
* Large seafood
* Tap water

**Eliminating What's Accumulated**

There's a few methods that have research for increasing excretion of microplastics. 

**Sauna Therapy** \- Sweating has been shown to be an effective route of elimination for various plastic chemicals. \[[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3255175/)\]

**Chlorella** \- this is one of the few ""toxin binders"" with an affinity to microplastics. \[[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844023095464)\] I've noticed it massively boosts my energy levels. There's very few brands that are quality. I know health ranger is okay and Ki Science is really good.

**Broccoli Sprouts** \- high in sulforaphane which upregulates different cellular detox pathways such as NRF2. This helps excrete all toxins, but especially microplastics, BPA, phthalates, and other forever chemicals. \[[3](https://www.oasishealth.app/blog/sulforaphane_removes_microplastics)\]

**Melatonin** (strange, I know) - some research shows that melatonin is protective against the toxic effects of microplastics. \[[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10488227/),[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10193254/),[6](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10495-025-02111-2)\] Who would have thought lol.

1mht74i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1mht74i/for_those_who_had_to_leave_a_love_they_did_not/,For those who had to leave a love they did not want to leave,"Hello! I want to tell my story to vent, this journey has been hard, and I would like you to give me some advice based on your personal experiences. I have been separated from my ex for two years, and legally divorced for one year. I can say that with a broken heart I had to say goodbye to the person I loved. I can't say that I did it to prioritize myself, in reality, at that moment I did it because of the pain and deep sadness of not feeling loved, valued and reciprocated.

When I met my ex, it was at work. I had been without a partner for a long time, maybe 5 years, and I was somehow afraid that they would hurt me again. When I met him, it was something like love at first sight. After so long, I was finally able to see in a man something that I felt coincided with my way of being, and that there was that complicity of feeling seen by someone. The truth is that he flirted with me from the first day I started working. We started to get along well and he looked for me a lot. His flirtation with me was very evident, but one day, in a conversation with him and other colleagues, he opened his wallet and I saw that he had a photo. It was a girl and I asked her very innocently who the girl in the photo was, and with great discomfort she told me: ""She's my girlfriend."" At that moment I was furious inside. It didn't seem fair to me that there were men with that level of nerve, without commitment, hurting the people around them regardless of the consequences. It was not the idea I had of him, and of course, from that moment on I distanced myself, I avoided him and I didn't even talk to him, in fact, I ignored him.

Sometimes he left me things on my desk, little notes, chocolates, etc. Still, I continued to avoid him. I told him that I was not going to fall into that game of being anyone's second option, that I didn't deserve it and that neither did his girlfriend, I asked him for respect. We grew apart, until about 5 or 6 months later he asked me if he could invite me out for coffee, that he wanted to talk to me. I accepted, we went out and the truth is that I liked him too much. We talked calmly and he told me that he had broken up with his girlfriend and that he wanted to have something formal with me. I accepted, although the truth is, with too many doubts because of the past. I was feeling my way and thinking that at any moment he could betray me like he did with his girlfriend. I also noticed that he was very flirtatious with women, but I clung to the idea that he was going to choose me. Today I think that I did it from my state of emotional lack, wanting to be seen, loved, chosen.

That was our courtship until we moved in together. There was a good time, he was very affectionate and attentive to me, but I lived in constant fear of betrayal. I didn't think about wanting to marry him, I just felt good being like that, with a certain freedom, because he didn't keep me tied down and I knew I could escape at any moment. I began to notice differences in daily life, and I always ran away from problems and returned to my apartment. I thought: ""I don't have to put up with this."" Until one day he told me: ""This can't go on like this, you have to accept that you have a relationship with me and that we already live together, you can't run away when something goes wrong."" And I recognized it, it scared me, but from that day on I accepted that I was in that relationship and decided to face my reality. I fought and improved to make my relationship better. They were the best days, until one day he asked me to marry him. Honestly, I didn't expect it and it wasn't something I was looking for, but it happened and I accepted. But something inside me wasn't so sure. There were things about him that I didn't like and that hurt me, and I still decided to omit them (big mistake). There were things like when we were walking down the street, he would look at the girls with a lot of lust and I would think: ""Don't be so squeamish, he has eyes and well, I'm missing out."" You don't have the right to complain to them (that's what I thought at the time, perhaps because I didn't confront them), even when I didn't, but that hurt me a lot and aroused a lot of insecurities in me.

Then we got involved in wanting to be parents. It didn't happen, we had a lot of problems being able to have children, although we fought a lot, it ended up wearing us out physically, emotionally and financially. I focused solely on having a baby because I wanted a family with my ex. I was excited that we were going to be parents, but after 5 years of trying, he started to distance himself from me. I did all this pregnancy stuff because I thought I wanted a family with him. However, 5 years of aggressive treatments, surgeries and medications wore me down physically and emotionally. I gained a lot of weight, I didn't realize how depressed I was. At that moment, he decided to dedicate himself to it. He started going to the gym, going out, being everywhere except with me. We never talked about it, I didn't even see it coming in the midst of so much depression. I only compared myself in what the girls he looked at were like and they had nothing to do with what I was at that time (I want to mention that I have always considered myself a beautiful woman with great qualities. My ex is not a physically attractive man, but he has a great personality and, above all, in the face of others, a lot of self-confidence, I think that was what attracted me the most to him). So I kept thinking that as soon as the children arrived everything would change, but that wasn't the case. I kept crying, until one day I dared to tell him: ""I feel like you don't love me anymore, I feel like you want to be away from me."" And I was surprised by his response. He told me: ""I don't know how I feel about you anymore, something changed."" I cried uncontrollably and he just told me: ""I'm going to the gym and then we'll talk, now that we're calmer."" I left the house upset, angry, crying. Something in me broke with that revelation. I spoke to a lawyer that day and asked him if he wanted a divorce. He said, ""Are you sure? Aren't you acting impulsively?"" And I told him no, because my love for him had not ended, with everything I had experienced. I had dedicated myself totally to him, to the point of forgetting myself, and I have always thought: love is a choice, love is not given simply by being with a person, it is something that is cultivated, not in the other, but in oneself. So love is one's own choice, and he had stopped choosing me.

From there, everything became hell. That man I idealized was transformed. I even asked him to go to therapy and he didn't accept. He wanted time, but not a divorce. I wanted space to know what he felt for me, to give him a year living as roommates, almost to see if he could feel something for me again. That hurt me a lot, and that hurts anyone's self-esteem. The thought that someone offers you crumbs of love is the cruelest thing a human being can offer another. ""Human misery."" He accepted and we went to therapy. We went for about a month to determine if getting a divorce was the best option. He mentioned in the final session of therapy that he wanted to try it with me, but on his terms, that he wasn't sure he could love me again or feel anything for me, but that he wanted to try, that he didn't want anything to do with having children, because he mentioned that the only thing I did and cared about was getting pregnant and that he was putting that aside. The therapist asked me, when it was my turn: ""What do you want?"" And I had listened carefully to every word he said and I told the therapist, ""I choose divorce, I don't want to be with him anymore."" I chose that because when you want to make an effort to recover a marriage, you have to know that the fear that both of you can lose, in the sense of not knowing if the other will be able to or not, is a risk and is latent. The vulnerability of both is present, because you cannot want to make an effort to recover something only by winning on your side, only hoping not to lose anything, but for the other person to lose everything. Because I wanted to fight for my marriage and I knew what that entailed, but he wanted me to fight because he knew that I loved him and he only wanted to act from his comfort, in the comfort of not losing anything, of saying: ""Well, I don't love you, but at this moment I don't choose you either."" And well, what he offered me were crumbs of love.

After that day, we continued with the divorce issues. I tried to be fair, but he started acting arrogant and with an inflated ego. He ended up fighting every moment for money, for material things, and I told him: ""Take what you want, just leave."" It is worth mentioning that I always contributed to the household to the same extent as him, because we earned the same. So he told me he wanted to keep the house, but in the end he couldn't pay me the corresponding amount. I asked for a loan and paid him half of the house, and I did it because it was the only way for this to end soon, since trying to sell it was going to be a real odyssey, because he didn't want to leave the house. He told me that he would live there until it was sold, but I couldn't continue like this, I couldn't continue seeing him, my heart hurt too much.

A few months after the divorce, I found out that he was already dating someone. It hurt me a lot, but in this time I have worked on myself, on recovering my spirit, my health and my self-esteem. Today I am better, but there is still damage from that pain, the pain of not being reciprocated. Today I see him very often at work, we don't talk to each other. Everyone tells me that divorcing him was the best thing that could have happened to me, that I am a lot to him, but I still try to get away from the emotional violence that I experienced in my marriage and of which I did not realize the economic violence, because he counted my expenses. So it's painful, painful to think that he grew up using me as a springboard, but also today I think that his actions speak only about him and that they don't define me. Today I treat my story with compassion. I think that I am not open to love, I think that everything I experienced hurt and traumatized me, that although I know that I am an attractive woman, no one approaches me and I think it is because I don't feel safe starting anything with anyone. I would like to, although I don't know if it will happen. I left the idea of being a mother behind, I would love to, although I don't feel brave enough now to face it alone. Maybe there is a future for me, will I be able to rebuild my life as much as my ex did? How could he have a clean slate and I'm still fighting this pain?",1,1754349828.0,Divorce,0,1.0,False
1mht738,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShanghaiDisneyland/comments/1mht738/how_we_as_newbies_hit_20_rides_in_1_day_at/,How we (as newbies) hit 20 rides in 1 day at Shanghai Disney,"This was my first time at Shanghai Disney! We purchased the Premier Access package of 8, as well as early entry.

We arrived at the park at about 7:15 am, and entered shortly after 7:30. We noticed huge crowds rushing to Zootopia, but i was surprised that not many were heading to Tomorrowland. I felt bad cause Hot Pursuit doesn't open til 9am, which meant people were rushing to be first in line at 9 - but that meant they'd still be 1.5 hours.

Anyway we were proud of how much we got done this day so I wanted to share it- especially cause I was feeling sick and had to take lots of break, and we were also dealing with ride shutdowns due to rain/lightning, but still made the most of it.

This is roughly how our day went (these times are rough estimates). This was Saturday, August 2nd:

7:15am - Taxi dropped us off at park

7:35am- entered park, headed straight to TRON

7:45am - TRON line was short - less than 20 minutes- so we rode TRON with no PA

8:15am - Rode 7 Dwarves, line was 35 minutes or so. no PA necessary

8:30am - Winnie the Pooh only had 10 minute line, we rode and i'm glad we did! very fun ride

9:00am - rode Zootopia with Premier Access pass

I was feeling really tired from lack of sleep, and slightly nauseous (i get more nauseous at theme parks if i haven't slept well) so i sat down on a bench and closed my eyes for 20 minutes

10:00am - rode Voyage to Crystal Grotto without PA cause line was less than 10 minutes

I was feeling really sick and tired, so I laid on a bench and closed my eyes for 30 minutes. then I went to first aid to get headache medicine, then we got coffee.

11:00 am - rode Peter Pan, always one of my favorites. Used PA

11:45 - Pirates line was less than 30 minutes, so rode that and saved our PA

12:15 - got lunch at Pinnochio's Village Kitchen

1:00 - checked our locker at TRON to make sure our stuff was still in there (it was) and rode Buzz lightyear Planet Rescue. this was surprisingly fun, and I like that it tracked our score

1:20 - did the camp discovery challenge. I was worried this was just for kids but it was actually pretty fun even for adults. I wish it had a zipline but it was still worth it and challenging enough to make it fun

2:00pm - used a PA for Roaring Rapids. It was a blast!

2:30pm - used a PA for Soaring over the horizon

3:00pm - decided to wait in line for 30 minutes for Jet packs. We were literally next in line at the gate, when the ride shut down due to lightning. We were disappointed but we noticed that the ride didn't last super long anyway. And there's similar rides to Jet Packs at most theme parks that we've ridden before. So of all the rides that could've shut down, we were ok that it was this one.

We decided since it was raining pretty hard we would sort of regroup and make a new plan. We went and used a PA for Buzz Lighyear and rode that again at about 3:45pm

Then we went back to Wander Zootopia, and get some snacks there. We got the big donut, some coffee, and the blueberry ice cream cone. All were great!

4:50pm -we decided to ride Pirates again. Line was short so we saved our PA. Afterwards, we got back in line again and used our PA, so we rode Pirates 3 times total, 2 of them back to back

6:15pm - Went back and rode TRON again and used our PA pass

7:00pm - Decided to go ride Hot Pursuit again, because line was under 50 minutes. We noticed this second time, without using the PA, there's a ton of stuff we missed the first time, that was skipped with the shorter line. like walking through the entire police station, the zootopia jail, etc.. the line moves pretty fast (the space for the line is pretty long so it feels like you are walking the whole time and not really standing still) so that was pretty cool

7:50pm - we were on our way back to Tomorrow land, but suddenly saw REX's Coaster was open after lightning closure -we ran there and got in line and rode it within 20 minutes. Short ride, made us feel a little sick but was really fun. I'm glad we did it, and i'm glad the ride wasn't any longer than it was or i might have thrown up ha.

8:20 - Buzz lightyear line was 0 minutes (it said 10 - but we got through and there was no one in line), so we rode that again

8:35pm - Purchased an additional PA for TRON, and rode it for the 3rd time that day

9:00pm - headed back to castle for fireworks.

We ended the day with one PA pass left for Voyage to Crystal Grotto. We had already ridden it in the morning without the PA pass. We were saving the pass for nighttime to see if it was cooler while lit up. But we decided to watch the Illuminate show instead.

We had a lot of really long breaks throughout the day. If we were to go back I think we could easily have hit 25 or more rides. If i had got a good night sleep the night before, we wouldn't have taken so many long breaks. But we hit all the main rides, and did Hot Pursuit x2, Pirates x3, Buzz x3, and TRON x3 ha.  
Also if you're using Early entry - there's a long way to walk so I'd say get to the park at 7 or sooner. 7:15 worked ok for us but by the time we entered the park it was past 7:30. The wording on the Early entry is confusing, because it says ""60 minutes early entry, but they start letting people in 90 minutes early."" We can confirm that they DO let people in 90 minutes early. So i'd almost say get to the park at 6:30, and you'll be in by 7.

I'm not a big Disney Parks guy so I'm not super experienced with this, but we felt like we had a really great, full day and appreciate all the posts on here that helped us plan well!

Things we would've squeezed in if I wasn't sick:

\-Enchanted Storybook Castle Walkthrough

\-Voyage to Crystal Grotto (at night)

\-Alices Curious Labyrinth

\-Jet Packs (we did have time for this, and made it through the line and would have rode it, if it wasn't for the lightning closure)

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Dynamo Kyiv vs. Pafos FC: A Clash of Titans (One Has a Dynamo, the Other Has‚Ä¶ Pafos?)**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a Champions League Qualification showdown that‚Äôs less *Gladiator* and more *Who‚Äôs Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?* On August 5th, Dynamo Kyiv (the Ukrainian heavyweights with a win streak smoother than a baby‚Äôs bottom) faces Pafos FC (Cyprus‚Äôs underdog with a resume that reads like a Netflix thriller: ‚ÄúWill they beat Maccabi Tel Aviv? Will they not? *Spoiler: They did, but only just*‚Äù). Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a Ukrainian chess grandmaster and the humor of a stand-up comic who‚Äôs had one too many coffees.

### Parse the Odds: Because Math, Not Magic

The bookmakers aren‚Äôt just throwing darts here‚Äîthey‚Äôre lobbing hand grenades at Pafos‚Äô chances. Dynamo Kyiv is the favorite at **1.75 odds** (implied probability: **57%**), while Pafos‚Äô **4.35 odds** (implied **21%**) suggest they‚Äôre the sports equivalent of a ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù on a dating app. The draw? A **3.35** shot (**28%**), which is basically the sportsbook‚Äôs way of saying, ‚ÄúHey, anything can happen if Dynamo‚Äôs goalkeeper starts juggling pigeons.‚Äù

The spread? Dynamo‚Äôs -1.0 line (you‚Äôll need a **2-goal win** to cash in) implies they‚Äôre expected to dominate, while the **under 4.5 goals** line at **2.07** suggests this won‚Äôt be a fireworks show. In short: Dynamo‚Äôs offense is a steady drip, not a geyser.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Form, and Why Pafos Should Bring a Snack

Dynamo Kyiv just **swept Hamrun Spartans 3-0, 3-0**, a feat akin to bringing a chainsaw to a knife fight. Their attack? Sharp. Their defense? Leakier than a sieve if you‚Äôre Pafos‚Äô striker, but sturdy enough to keep the Euros in their pocket. Key players like **Andriy Yarmolenko** (Ukraine‚Äôs ‚ÄúHuman Torpedo‚Äù) are fit, which is less exciting than it sounds‚Äîthink of him as the team‚Äôs emotional support dog.

Pafos, meanwhile, squeaked past **Maccabi Tel Aviv 1-0 on aggregate**, a result so narrow it could fit in a thimble. Their secret weapon? A defense that‚Äôs mastered the art of ‚Äúalmost scoring,‚Äù and a midfield that moves at the glacial pace of a 1980s

1mhswbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1mhswbf/blindsided_by_a_trad_wife/,Blindsided by a Trad Wife.,"TLDR: Potential new friend I now highly suspect was groomed into a relationship with a 30+ older man when she was 16, has no job, no education, no financial independence, and just revealed she‚Äôs pregnant. Her biggest concerns are not being allowed to play in our (no kids) D&D game and disappointing people with a miscarriage. Says she likes being a homemaker and has no desire to get a job or go to school. I feel really bad for her. She‚Äôs likely been groomed since childhood, but I also can‚Äôt help her and I don‚Äôt want that trad-wife mentality in my life. 

We‚Äôve been interviewing players for our next D&D campaign and we recently met a lovely  person who seemed like a perfect fit with her creatively and enthusiasm. 

But there were some odd details that were raising some yellow flags. When she first showed up we mistook her for a teenager out with her silver-haired dad. Nope that was her partner of 10 years. Her partner didn‚Äôt come over to say hi and avoided us. On her social profile she had said she was 28, but as we were chatting she told us she was 26. So that makes her a minor by two years when her and her partner got together. She also said she‚Äôs been a homemaker for 10 years but was hoping to either get a job or go to school soon. When her and her partner left the quiet cafe, next to the daycare, in our residential area her partner revved his motorbike loudly for a whole minute before peeling out of there at speed.

Not wanting to punish her for the jerk-like behaviour of her partner and possible predatory nature of their relationship, we started building her character for the game. She was really into it and had some fantastic ideas. Then she ghosted us for a week. 

Then she asked to meet with me over coffee and revealed she was pregnant. She kept repeating that her partner was really excited, but when I asked how she felt she said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù, that she was overwhelmed, her biggest concern was a miscarriage because it would disappoint people, and she‚Äôs scared of all the changes to her body and lifestyle restrictions to ensure a healthy birth. 

I asked about her plans for work and school and she said, ‚Äúoh I just say that when I first meet people so they don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a slob. But I like being a homemaker‚Äù. 

The weirdest thing was that I was the first person she told other than her partner. None of her family knows yet. She was really worried about us not letting her play in our game because we have a strict (no players with kids policy). But she‚Äôs also scared to tell her family because she‚Äôd feel bad for drawing attention and is anxious about disappointing them if she miscarries. 

Trust me, I tried to lay out all the options and aids for her, but towards the end of the convo she seemed dedicated to the trad-wife life. No financial independence, no bank account, no job experience, no education (she was a high school dropout), and now has a baby on the way. You just can‚Äôt help some people. 

I feel really bad for her. I was the product of grooming and predatory men, but I dunno, I had a stubborn survivalist independent side to me as well. Obviously we are not going to add her to our game.

1mhswav,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1mhswav/the_man_in_the_reflection/,The man in the reflection,"I‚Äôd been on the help desk night shift for just under a month, and the novelty had already worn off.  
Nights were quiet, sure ‚Äî but it was the kind of quiet that made your ears ring. Most of the work came in through tickets and occasional calls from overseas staff, usually the same complaints:

* ‚ÄúMy password expired.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúThe printer says paper jam but there‚Äôs no paper.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúMy computer hates me.‚Äù

By 2:17‚ÄØa.m., I was half-watching the help desk dashboard and half-stirring a cold cup of coffee when it popped up ‚Äî a new ticket.

No name. No department. No location. Just the subject line:

No details in the description field. No attachments. It should‚Äôve gone straight to ‚ÄúNeeds Info,‚Äù but company policy was *every* ticket got a callback, no matter how ridiculous.

The extension in the ticket wasn‚Äôt one I recognized, but I dialed anyway.

One ring.

The man who answered didn‚Äôt say hello ‚Äî he said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here,‚Äù like we‚Äôd been in the middle of a conversation.

I introduced myself from IT. He chuckled softly ‚Äî not the happy kind, more like the sound someone makes when they‚Äôve given up on explaining something.

‚ÄúYou should see for yourself,‚Äù he whispered, and gave me his workstation ID.

I pulled up the remote session tool‚Ä¶ but the machine wasn‚Äôt on our network. No record of it anywhere. That shouldn‚Äôt have been possible. Still, somehow, the session connected.

The screen wasn‚Äôt a desktop. It was static ‚Äî that fuzzy, snow-like grain you only see on old TVs. But within the static, shapes began to form: an office desk, papers scattered, a man sitting there. Him.

And behind him, in the dark reflection of a window, stood‚Ä¶ something.

I blinked. And the figure in the reflection blinked back.

Before I could say anything, the call dropped. The static went black. The ticket vanished from my queue like it had never existed.

I sat there, staring at the empty dashboard, wondering if I‚Äôd imagined the whole thing. But when my supervisor came in that morning, I mentioned it.

He froze, then quietly went to his desk. Came back with a manila folder.

Inside were printed screenshots. My screenshots. The same desk. The same man. The same‚Ä¶ thing.

Only the timestamps said they were taken in 2015 ‚Äî ten years before I was even hired.

And in the last photo, the man at the desk wasn‚Äôt him anymore.  
It was me.

Under the photo, in shaky handwriting, was a note:

""Once you see him....He sees you.""

I also have a new coffee bar which allowed me to plumb in the synchronika. I also got a new push down wdt tool. These three upgrades have definitely simplified my workflow.

So, I‚Äôm kinda floating through life solo, daydreaming about someone to share late-night chats and epic gaming sessions with. I‚Äôm a bit of a lone wolf, but I‚Äôm ready to find someone who gets me, someone who‚Äôs down to dive into life‚Äôs big questions and maybe geek out over anime or a tough boss fight. üòÖ If you‚Äôre looking for a meaningful connection, hit me up‚Äîlet‚Äôs see where this goes!  

About me
‚Ä¢ 22, equal parts introspective and ready for adventure.  
‚Ä¢ Quiet at first, but I open up into a nerdy whirlwind of thoughts.
‚Ä¢ Total geek for psychological anime and games that make me rage-quit (in a fun way).  

My hobbies
üéÆ Grinding through Dark Souls, Elden ring, guilty gear, or Rimworld.  
üì∫ Binge-watching mind-bending anime like Serial Experiments Lain, Hunter x Hunter, or Paranoia Agent.

Stuff I Wanna Try:
üèÉ Speedrunning my favorite games (and probably failing spectacularly).  
ü•ä Mastering a new fighting game character to dominate the leaderboard.  

Things I‚Äôm Obsessed With:
üí¨ Late-night talks about the meaning behind a good story or game.  
üéµ Swapping Spotify playlists to vibe together (bonus points if you‚Äôre into moody or eclectic tunes).  
üéÆ Co-op gaming sessions that turn into laughing fits or rage quits

I‚Äôm just a guy who loves diving deep into stories, games, and big ideas, hoping to find someone who‚Äôs up for the same. Bonus points if you‚Äôre in Midwest and want to grab coffee or stargaze IRL! So, if you‚Äôre into anime marathons, tough games, or just vibing over life‚Äôs mysteries, slide into my DMs. Maybe you‚Äôre the Player 2 I‚Äôve been searching for? üïπÔ∏èüåÉ

Starting weight: 235 lbs (mid January)

Current: 185 lbs

Height: 5'4""


I‚Äôm a full-time working mom with two young kids, a packed schedule, and very little downtime. Most of my workouts happen after 7 PM ‚Äî after dinner, dishes, and bedtime routines. It‚Äôs not easy, but it‚Äôs my time, and I‚Äôve learned to love it.

My routine has been:

Gym 5 nights/week, mostly strength training (machines, cables, dumbbells)

Step class every Monday

Meal prep to stay on top of macros, focusing on high protein (aiming for 140g/day)

Tracking daily weight, sleep, HRV, food, water, and mood


I‚Äôve done this without perfection. I still grab my iced coffee at Tims every morning. I‚Äôve had nights where I skip the gym to clean, or weekends that derail me a bit. But I keep going ‚Äî I log everything and always get back on track.

This journey has changed how I see myself. I‚Äôm stronger, more patient, and finally feel like I‚Äôm showing up for me too ‚Äî not just as a mom or employee or partner.

I‚Äôll try to answer any questions if you‚Äôre curious about routines, tracking, or parenting through it. If you're juggling all the things and feeling stuck, I hope this shows that slow and steady still works ‚ù§Ô∏è",39,1754348880.0,beginnerfitness,11,0.99,False

I‚Äôm down to meet anyone and everyone. I have a pretty wide-ranging sense of humor (I laugh at awkward, bad, sad situations to cope). I like coffee, tv/movies, music recommendations, 90‚Äôs nostalgia. I suck at video games but I play some. I like football & basketball, and the smell of new shoes. 

I‚Äôm married. I work in education. I‚Äôm into photography.  

I don‚Äôt care if we have anything in common. I am open to chatting with any of you weirdos. 

Let‚Äôs be best friends‚Ä¶ or short acquaintances. Let‚Äôs chat. ",1,1754348851.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,1,0.67,False
