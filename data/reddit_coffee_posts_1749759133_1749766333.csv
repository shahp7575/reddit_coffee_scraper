Hey! I’m Ad—21 and from the UK, freshly graduated and currently held together by anxiety, excessive compassion, and sheer willpower.

I don’t have a plan—at all. I know I’ve got to leave London, and I’m dead set on not ending up back in my hometown a decade from now. I can’t stay still, I can’t go back… so I’m just trying to keep moving forward.

I like fog, good coffee, and conversations that spiral from “how was your day?” to “do animals experience awe?”

Looking for kind people to chat with—about politics, philosophy, aesthetics, or just the strange little joys of being alive. Bonus points if you’re the kind of person who notices moss on walls or gives names to foxes you pass on your walk home.

DMs are open—don’t be shy, just tell me who you are and what’s going on :)",1,1749765273.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

1l9z27k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAustralian/comments/1l9z27k/urban_exploration_lost_places/,Urban Exploration / Lost Places,"Hi friends,
I’m trying to locate a unique commercial building somewhere around Melbourne’s city loop, and I hope someone here might recognize it.

Before the pandemic, I visited this place and it left a deep impression on me — not just for its coffee, but for the overall atmosphere and design. Here’s what I remember:
	•	The building’s exterior was a black glass curtain wall — flat and minimalistic, with no exterior pillars, awnings, or decorative features.
	•	The entire structure had a cube-like shape — not a high-rise, but a small, boxy building with very clean lines.
	•	The front entrance was located on the southwest corner, tucked to the side — small and low-profile, not grand or flashy at all.
	•	Just outside the entrance, to the left, there was a small window for takeaway coffee orders.
	•	The rear exit led into a quiet laneway with no outdoor seating.
	•	The lobby itself was the coffee bar — not just a café on the side, but a true hybrid space, where the café counter blended seamlessly into the design of the lobby.
	•	If you walked in the front, you’d see the restrooms to the right before reaching the back exit.
	•	The interior walls and even the restroom doors were adorned with classic solid wood paneling or carved veneer.
	•	The bathroom faucets were solid brass, giving the whole place a timeless, elegant charm.

It was quiet there — no trams passed by, and it felt like a little hidden sanctuary in the middle of the city.

Sadly, I didn’t take any photos at the time. But I often think back to it — not just as a coffee spot, but as a special memory I want to recover.

If any of this rings a bell, I’d be deeply grateful for your help.
“If you know this place, please let me know — I’m trying to find a piece of my memory.”

1l9yza4,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiction/comments/1l9yza4/mentally_ill/,MENTALLY İLL,"(It is the quietest wing of the mental hospital. Behind a heavy door, a room exclusive only to selected doctors. Scratch marks on the walls, an old leather sofa and fluorescent lamps flickering in places. Rose firmly grasps her file and clicks the door.)



Rose: (in a low voice)

“Nathan Whitmore?”



(The door is December. A light smile comes from inside.)



Nathan:

“If you're knocking, I know you'll come in. Then why are you trying?”



Rose: (steps in, stands cautiously but upright)

“Because I still believe in the rules.”



Nathan: (he's sitting on the old sofa in the corner of the room, his hands are joined on his knees, his gaze is piercing)

“Rules... What a sweet word. What about me? Can you define me by your rules too?”



Rose: (looks at the notebook)

""a 27-year-old with an undiagnosed personality disorder. A tendency to consider oneself superior to other people, high intelligence, violation of boundaries...”

(he raises his head, they meet eye to eye)

“But also very good manipulation skills.”



Nathan: (smiles)

“I want to play a game with you, Rose.”



Rose:

“This is not a game. This is therapy. It's a process with rules.”



Nathan: (he leans forward slowly from where he is sitting)

“But shall I tell you a secret?”

(his voice drops)

“I can only express myself when I play.”



Rose: (slightly startled, but does not show it, sits down in the chair)

“It surprises me that you are so comfortable.”



Nathan:

“Because I'm watching you. Since the first day you arrived. You're different from other doctors.”



Rose:

“Different, what do you mean?”



Nathan:

“You are not trying to solve me. You're listening to me.”

(he takes a break Dec.)

“But be careful. Everyone who listens will eventually either go crazy... or fall in love.”



Rose: (with a slight smile)

“Was that a threat?”



Nathan:

“No... it's just statistics.”



(Silence. They both stare at each other. The energy between them Decelerates. Nathan suddenly stands up, but not menacingly, on the contrary, controlled.)



Nathan:

“Don't ask the questions today. Let me ask.”



Rose: (raises her eyebrows but allows)

“All right. Ask.”



Nathan: (approaches, but keeps his distance)

“Who did you see last in your dream?”



Rose:

“What has this matter to do with you?”



Nathan:

“Because sometimes... people see in their dreams the desires that they suppress the most.”

(he continues in a low voice)

“And I think I was in your dream.”



Rose: (clears her throat, doesn't miss her eyes)

“You take yourself too seriously.”



Nathan:

“no. I'm just being very careful.”

(he examines her gestures with his eyes)

“And your pupils can't lie to me, Rose.”

(Rose briefly looks into Nathan's eyes. His heart is beating. Although he tries to control himself, his body language gives him away. Nathan realizes this, does not retreat.)



Nathan:

“They told you I was a bad person, didn't they?”



Rose:

“I'm here to see what you are, not what other people say.”



Nathan: (shakes his head slightly, squints his eyes Tuesday)

“That's why I love you.”



Rose: (sternly)

“This... that's not the right word, Nathan. This could be a transfer. A patient's temporary feelings for his therapist.”



Nathan: (comes closer, rests on the table)

“Temporary? Every time I look at you, even the whispers in my mind stop, Rose.”

(his voice drops)

“This is not temporary. This is peace.”



Rose: (he turns the pen in his hand, his eyes are caught on her fingers)

“For someone like you, even peace of mind can be a threat.”



Nathan:

“What about for you? To be in the same room with me... To come so close to the darkness... Doesn't it bother you at all?”



Rose: (in a whisper, without missing her eyes)

“I'm here even though he did.”



(The air in the room condenses.Nathan takes another step. The distance Decoupled between them is now a few inches.)



Nathan:

“I can hear your heart beating, Rose.”

(he pretends to put his hand to his chest, but does not touch it)

“This is not fear. I don't have the power to scare you... it attracts you more.”



Rose: (her lips tremble but her voice is determined)

“If you make this mistake, I will have to stop therapy here.”



Nathan: (smiles, if his head is slightly)

“But you don't want to interrupt. Because when you're talking to me... and you're getting closer to yourself.”

(tilts his head to the side)

“How long has it been so... you didn't feel alive, did you?”



Rose: (holds her breath, then retreats, returns to her chair, but her voice is still not shaky)

“I'm ending this conversation here. That's it for today.”



Nathan: (he leans back slowly, a vague smile on his lips)

“Of course... doctor, ma'am.”

(his voice is sarcastic but compassionate)

“But this is only the beginning.”



Rose:

“I'm here to save you, Nathan.”



Nathan:

“No, Rose. You came here to save yourself... but you don't realize it.”



(Looking at Nathan for the last time, Rose leaves the room. As he walks down the corridor, his breathing becomes irregular. Anyone looking from the outside would think you were just tired. But inside... Nathan's voice still resonates.)



(Corridor. The sounds of Rose's heels walking in silence echo on the wall. He doesn't have his hands in his pockets, he doesn't have a notebook. It's as if he left not the room, but Nathan's mind... He stands on a bench and takes a deep breath.)



Rose (inner voice):

“This is not professionalism. This is an uncontrolled thing. It's like burning with a dark person when he draws you in...”



(He puts his thumb to his lips involuntarily. It's a move he's made unwittingly throughout therapy. He's coming to his senses at that moment. He's looking around. The corridor is empty. Squeezing his file, he starts walking towards his room.)





\---



In the meantime... THE THERAPY ROOM.



(Nathan is still in the same place. He looks at the chair where Rose is sitting. His eyes are empty, but in one way... in life.)



Nathan (in a whisper):

“Rose.”



(He stands up slowly. He runs his fingers through his hair, as if he wants not to express his tension Decently. Then he slowly starts talking to himself, whether it's a dream or not, it's not clear.)



Nathan:

“You have not looked at me with mercy. Compassion is a condescending thing. You understood me.”



(He leans his head back, his eyes are closed. It was as if there was still that warmth in the room with his presence.)



Nathan:

“They say you want to save yourself. But it's you who really wants to be saved, Rose. No matter how much you try to protect your borders... the voices inside you don't stop either, do they?”



(He suddenly opens his eyes. His eyes are not red, but there is something flashing in them. Desire? Or the danger?)



Nathan:

“I will tear you to pieces.”

(smiles)

“But gently.”





\---



ROSE'S ROOM



(Rose is looking at herself in the mirror. He pauses as he takes off the jacket. He notices the pulse on her neck, her hands are shaking. He opens the water bottle, but he can't drink. His eyes slide to the glass. He sees eye to eye with his own reflection in the glass.)



Rose (inner voice):

“What are you doing? You entered that room to solve it. But his eyes, it was like he could read your subconscious.”



(He reaches for his phone. In the search history ‘Consultant Psychiatrist - Dr. Dec. Zack's name still stands. His finger tremblingly hovers over it, but he does not call. He breathes, deeply and painfully.)



Rose:

“I'm his therapist.”

(pauses, in a whisper)

“I can't fall in love with him.”



At that time... WHEN NATHAN WAS ALONE IN THE ROOM



(Darkness has begun to fall. He walks towards the looking glass. He locks his eyes to the glass. He is so quiet that he cannot even hear his own breathing.)



Nathan:

“They are watching me. But you... you look at it differently.”



(He puts his fingers on the glass, almost like touching her face.)



Nathan:

“I don't know what to do with you, Rose. It's the line between Deconstructing you and loving you... it's very thin.”



evening



(Rose's room. Night. It's dark, it's raining outside. The drops flowing through the glass create flickering shadows on the wall by the light of the dim lamp. Rose is tired. He's lying on his bed. His eyes are closing.)



THE DREAM BEGINS.



(The therapy room... but it's different. The walls are darker, there are no tables. Just two chairs. And Rose is not alone.)



(Nathan is sitting right across from her. This time his hands are not tied. His clothes are casual but stylish; black shirt, messy hair. His gaze is sharp, but... there's a part of him that's suffocatingly soft.)



Nathan:

“There are no limits this time. And there are no questions.”



Rose (confused):

“This is the place... it's not a therapy room.”



Nathan:

“But you imagined me here again. Don't lie to yourself, Rose.”



Rose:

“It's a dream.”



Nathan:

“yes. And this is the most honest version of you that your mind has given me.”



(Nathan stands up, his steps slow but steady. Rose wants to step back, but her chair restrains her. Nathan kneels down and comes to eye level.)



Nathan:

“Your pupils are growing. The sound of your heart is ringing in my ears. You think you're scared, but”""



(He holds out his hand. He touches Rose's cheek. The moment his fingers touch her skin, Rose holds her breath.)



Rose (in a whisper):

“Don't.”



Nathan:

“No one stops in a dream, Rose. Everything you suppress is revealed here.”



(He puts his head closer to her neck. His breath is hot and dangerous.)



Nathan:

“You don't want me. You want to escape from yourself.”



Rose (eyes closed, out of breath):

“You are a patient.”



Nathan:

“And you are a woman who cannot stop understanding me.”



The distance between them is Decoupled. Her lips come closer together, but just before kissing... a scream breaks out Dec. Rose's scream.)



Rose suddenly wakes up.



(He is sitting up in bed, his forehead is covered in sweat. Breathlessly. He puts his hands to his head. It's still raining on the window, but it's much quieter outside.)



Rose (in a whisper, to herself):

“No... no, it's just a dream.”



(But something is still squeezing in his chest. It's like a knot where desire and guilt are tangled together. His eyes involuntarily shift to the window... and for a moment, he feels as if someone is looking at him through the window of the hospital building.)



Rose (to herself):

“This... will not end.”



the day after



(Hospital, morning. Rose is holding her coffee in her hand, but she's not drinking. They have purple under the eyes. His fingers are trembling in the cup. He's walking slowly down the hall to Nathan's room. When he gets his fingers on the doorknob, he gets out of breath.)



Rose(inner voice):

“Calm down. Yesterday was just a dream. It's just a dream. Psychological reflection. You can't let it affect you.”



(He opens the door. Nathan's sitting there in the chair. His arms are on the table. She has her head slightly tilted to the side, watching him arrive. He's smiling - too calm, too... familiar.)

Nathan:

“You're too late today. Or... did you have a hard time waking up?”



Rose (dully):

“...Sir?”



Nathan (without blinking an eye):

""Sometimes dreams make a person dizzy in the morning. Especially if the person... met his desires in that dream.”



(Rose's face tightens. His heart speeds up. He sits down, but does not take the pen in his hand, does not open the notebook.)



Rose:

“This is a therapy session. It's not a game. Please let's not personalize it.”



Nathan (if his head, his smile becomes sneaky):

“It is not I who am making it personal, Rose. Thinking about me all night long... it was you.”



Rose:

“This... this is completely unreasonable.”



Nathan:

“You approached me in a dream. You wanted to stop me. But you couldn't even stop yourself.”

(he stares into her eyes)

“The pulse in your neck is still there, Rose. In the same place, at the same speed.”



(Rose gets up, staggering.)



Rose:

“That's nonsense. How do you know all this?”



Nathan (leans forward slightly, his voice low but devastating):

“I am in you.”



(Silence. The room seems to suffocate for a moment. Rose's pen falls out of her hand, she looks out of the window, but her eyes seem to be stuck in the room. Nathan is leaning back in his chair, comfortably.)



Nathan:

“When you were trying to solve me... you opened yourself. There's a room in your mind reserved for me now. And I have no intention of getting out of there.”



Rose (in a whisper):

“you... you're a patient.”



Nathan (without squinting):

“You too... you're not that healthy anymore.”

(Rose quickly leaves the room. He breathes deeply with his back against the wall, covering his face with his hands. It's almost like tears will be shed. But she won't cry. Because he doesn't cry... he fears even worse: that Nathan is right.)







evening 



(Night. The hospital archive room. Rose waited for the other therapists to come out. He has a flashlight and a staff card in his hand. His heart doesn't fit in his chest.)



Rose (inner voice):

“I was supposed to keep my distance from you, but dreams... it goes deeper than the truth. I have to understand you, Nathan. Where did you come from? What did you do?”



(He opens the locks of the glazed cabinets, finds the thick file with a red label that says 'Nathan Whitmore'. He opens it with trembling hands. The pages are yellowed, some are missing, some are scrawled in black ink.)



What is written in the file (with the inner voice of Rose between Decals):



\> Patient name: Nathan Whitmore

Date of birth: September 1, 1997

Diagnosis: Antisocial personality disorder, post-traumatic psychosis

Note: The patient witnessed the death of his entire family at the age of 17. It was noted that he showed no reaction at the scene.

Rose (in a whisper):

“His parents... are they dead?”



\> Event Summary:

A house fire. He was detained on suspicion of murder but was released due to lack of evidence. He said only one sentence: “I just made them quiet down.”

Rose (in surprise):

“Have I made it quiet? What does this mean?”



\> Monitoring Note - 2021:

The patient shows manipulative behavior towards other patients. He shows impressive, seductive attitudes, especially towards female therapists. It was not clear whether he was conscious or unconscious. 





\> Private note (confidential):

His previous therapist, Dr . Shaw was dismissed from his post after inappropriate intimacy with the patient. The therapist suffered a serious psychotic breakdown after her sessions with Nathan. He's been admitted to the hospital right now.







(Rose's hands are shaking. Her pupils are enlarged, her lip is dry. It's like he's afraid to go to the next page. But it goes on.)



\> Drawing Octets:

The pictures Nathan made: burned hands, women's faces, broken mirrors... and in one of them a silhouette that looks exactly like Rose.







Rose (putting her hand over her mouth):

“Is that... is that me?”



(At that moment, a voice comes from behind. The room is dim, but that voice is familiar. We're very familiar.)



Nathan (from the door, in a soft but icy tone):

“I knew you liked to be alone at night. But I didn't know you preferred the archive room, Rose.”



(Rose can't turn around. The file in his hand falls to the ground. Nathan doesn't come out of the shadows, we just hear his voice.)



Nathan:

“Tell me now... even after what you have seen... will you still try to understand me? Otherwise, no more... did you realize that you can't run away from me even in your dreams?”





(In the archive room, Rose is still unable to look in the direction from which Nathan's voice came. The file fell to the ground. His fingers hold the pages, but his eyes are in Nathan's shadow.)



Nathan (footsteps are heard):

“I know you're scared, Rose. But there is something else underneath that fear. Curiosity. Desire. Loyalty. Don't deny him.”



Rose (breathing fast):

“You... are a sick person. These feelings are not real. You're a manipulation. You always do that!”



Nathan (comes closer, his voice is very close to his ear):

“Then why can't you shut up your heart?”



(Rose turns suddenly, her chest close enough to Nathan's to touch. They see eye to eye. There's something in Nathan's eyes — something burning. It's like madness and passion are intertwined. Rose wants to take a step back, but her feet won't budge.)



Rose:

“I had to... treat you.”



Nathan:

“But you have been ill yourself.”

(he stares into her eyes)

""You touched me, Rose. Even in the first session. With your eyes, with your voice, with your mind. Now you want to have me. You're saying let's break all the rules.”



(Rose's eyes fill up, but she doesn't cry. He puts his hand on Nathan's chest, tries to push. But his hand remains powerless. Nathan holds her hand, gently stroking her fingers.)



Rose (in a whisper):

“This... wrong.”



Nathan:

“But your body says ‘yes’. How did you feel when you saw me in your dream? When you touched my neck? When you mix your breath with mine?”



(Rose closes her eyes. Not tears, but fire pours out of it. Nathan, he touches your face. He strokes her cheek with his thumb.)



To be continued



1. Do you think, Rose, Nathan is really in love, or is he just drawn to his dark side?

2. Can love heal the darkness inside Nathan?

3. Do you think the relationship between the two is based more on passion, or is there a real connection between them? Deca Deca deca deca deca deca deca deca deca?

4. Can a therapist fall in love with his patient? Do you think Rose has overstepped her professional boundaries?

5. Does Nathan's history of mental illness make this relationship dangerous?

6. Is Rose losing her identity by getting closer to Nathan, or is she becoming herself for the first time?

[7.Do](http://7.Do) you think this relationship can turn into a healthy love, or does it lead to destruction?

8.Does Nathan really love Rose, or is he controlling her?

9. Is this relationship a “story of salvation” or a “beautiful disaster”?

I watched as the ***ONE*** barista at the cafe had to juggle 6 customers. She did an amazing job and the drinks still came out quickly (compared to Starbucks, anyways), but other customers were starting to get nasty and making comments about having to wait.

She doesn’t, and honestly it’s outrageous. Jeff Bezo can cut back on buying rocket ships and give his whole food employees some coffee and pastries during their shift, for free.

katherynkliewercoldcase@gmail.com

This is a link to an article for more information:

https://infotel.ca/newsitem/decades-without-answers-in-vernon-cold-case-murder/it65913

—————————

A quick summary of the article:

Katheryn Kliewer was a 25 year old woman when she was murdered on Wednesday, May 19th, 1976.

She was found in a hotel room at the Village Green Inn by the cleaner who checked on Katheryn and discovered she was deceased.

Two cops who were drinking coffee in the hotel at the time of her discovery and responded first before calling more officers to the scene.

Katheryn is thought to have been strangled to death with (possibly) a pair of pantyhose (as a pair of nylons were discovered next to her body) sometime around midnight.

There was no evidence of sexual assault, was wearing her nightdress, and had only been in Vernon for about two days before her murder.

She moved to Vernon from Kelowna on May 17th, 1976 after she was given a promotion to accountant. She transferred from the Vancouver branch of CIBC where she had worked for two years.

Police say, “We have got some idea of where she went earlier in the evening, but we’ve still got a few blanks to fill in.” Her location before her death was never released to the public (to my knowledge). No suspects were found, and her case quickly went cold.

I (26M) am looking for advice on how to stop feeling guilty about saying no to my mother (60F) constantly asking for money.
This has been an ongoing issue for me since I first started working where she would ask to take the entire paycheck or ask for money to better her situations. For the past 6 years, she has started multiple jobs just to end up quitting a couple weeks later. When we’ve run out of money completely, she has written bad checks, convinced me to write bad checks, and always takes money from others and never gives anything back, and gets defensive when people ask for a fraction of the money back.
I used to give her money or treated her to lunches, some shopping, etc. happily when we were more stable financially, but we have not been stable situation for a long while, even battling homelessness for a time.
Right now, we just recovered from homelessness, and we both started new jobs and I fear that everything will start again.
We don’t have any money right now, my card has been maxed out in overdraft, I’ve used up the last of the money my dad has given me (he is even worse financially), and I’m barely surviving until my first paycheck.
She has always asked for money and will spend it on trivial things like makeup, whatever candy is her favorite that week, coffee from Dunkin’, etc.
Most times I get extremely angry because she will take so much of the money that nothing is left for me to use for myself (I only buy essential needs and gas for our car). I’ve told her no in the past and she says that I’m being selfish, cruel, or an a-hole. I’ve been told by every single person I’ve vented to that I need to just say no and that’s it, but I find it so difficult when I feel so emotionally torn to help her.
Example: I finally told her that I’m so tired of her asking for money for little things. She doesn’t need chocolate, she doesn’t need milk for her coffee, she doesn’t need to buy makeup, she can’t just order whatever from fast food, and that I have no money left and it angers me to no end (not to mention taking care of her dogs, my dog, our roommates dog and chores around the house). She called me cruel, bipolar, and an a-hole for expressing that to her, and that we’re in a “give and take” situation right now and that helping other people is what being an adult is. In turn, I feel guilty and feel like I’m the bad person even though I know I don’t need to carry a fully grown adult on my back.

TLDR: My mother emotionally guilts me when I tell her no to giving her money for trivial things and I need to learn how to build a boundary.",0,1749764361.0,povertyfinance,2,0.5,False

I am a recent TAMU grad ('25) working with a development company on a new retail center going in near Nash Street and Hwy 6 (across from the Boonville road shopping center) and 2 minutes from the new Blinn Campus entrance. 

I wanted to reach out to you guys and the community to see what exactly students and residents are missing in that area along with any ideas on who you would love to see! (favorite food places, coffee shops, study areas, etc.) I understand with the construction going on it can be quite difficult to get to your favorite places. Nash street is also somewhat of a ""dead zone"" meaning that there is not much available in the area for students and other community members to rely on and enjoy; especially for Blinn students and commuters).

As a former student, I would love to hear your guys thoughts and honest feedback as it would help me immensely! Also, if you know someone who owns a business and may be interested feel free to let me know!

I experience nausea and stomach cramps pretty often and I kind of struggle to eat an entire meal unless I’m smoking weed, which really helps me. I’m now in a really weird situation where I struggle to have more than a coffee during the day, then I smoke and eat like two meals worth of food at night. I’m just at a loss of what to do.

A quick summary of the article:

Katheryn Kliewer was a 25 year old woman when she was murdered on Wednesday, May 19th, 1976.

She was found in a hotel room at the Village Green Inn by the cleaner who checked on Katheryn and discovered she was deceased.

Two cops who were drinking coffee in the hotel at the time of her discovery and responded first before calling more officers to the scene.

Katheryn is thought to have been strangled to death with (possibly) a pair of pantyhose (as a pair of nylons were discovered next to her body) sometime around midnight.

There was no evidence of sexual assault, was wearing her nightdress, and had only been in Vernon for about two days before her murder.

She moved to Vernon from Kelowna on May 17th, 1976 after she was given a promotion to accountant. She transferred from the Vancouver branch of CIBC where she had worked for two years.

————————————————————

I (22F) have been dating my boyfriend (39M) for almost a year. We don’t live together, but we spend a lot of time at each other’s places. For the most part, things are good — we get along well, have fun, etc. But money stuff has become kind of an ordeal lately.

When we first started dating, I was making a bit more than him, so I didn’t mind covering stuff here and there. Like, I’d pay for dinner, he’d get the next one. Pretty normal. But as time went on, it kind of stopped being “taking turns” and just became me… paying. For everything.

We go out to eat? I pay. Groceries? Me. Ubers? Me. When we order takeout at his place, he’ll say “I’ll get the next one,” but that never actually happens. He’ll Venmo me for like $6 for a coffee once every three weeks and act like that makes it even.

What makes this worse is that he’s not broke. He’s almost 40 and even though I make more, he does make a healthy living. He has a job (in tech, fully remote), no kids, no major bills outside of rent. I asked him once about splitting things more evenly and he said he’s “just bad at keeping track of who paid last.” Okay, but I’m not?? And I’ve brought it up rationally, I’m 99% sure. 

So a few nights ago, we were out with his friends (first time I’d met most of them) and someone made a joke about him “spoiling” me. Like “oh man, she’s got you wrapped around her finger, huh?” and I just laughed and said, “Oh trust me, if anyone’s getting spoiled, it’s not me.”

He asked what I meant, and I said something like, “Let’s just say my Venmo history tells a different story.” I wasn’t trying to cause a scene, I said it lightly, but it got weird. His friends kind of laughed awkwardly and changed the subject. 

Later that night he was pissed. Like super hostile for no reason as all. Said I “humiliated” him in front of his friends and made him look like a “freeloader,” and that if I had a problem I should’ve brought it up privately. I told him I have brought it up, multiple times, and nothing changed — so maybe I was just done being quiet about it!!

He slept on the couch and we haven’t really talked since. One of his friends messaged me on Instagram and said it was a “low blow” to call him out like that, especially when I knew he was sensitive about money.

I don’t know. I’m not trying to ruin his reputation or emasculate him or whatever, but I feel like I’m being gaslit into thinking this is normal when it’s not?

AITA?

1l9ygy1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1l9ygy1/the_man_in_the_red_scarf/,The Man in the Red Scarf,"I was walking home from work when I found the notebook.

It was lying on the second step of the Bleecker Street station, spine cracked, a bright red scarf looped around it like someone meant to come back. I don’t usually touch things that don’t belong to me, but it was starting to rain, and something about it-how carefully the scarf was folded, how the notebook was placed, not dropped-made me stop.

Inside the cover, it said:

**“If found, please don’t return. Just read.”**

So I did.

The first entry was from someone named Miles. He wrote about missing a train on purpose. About following a dog because he liked its energy. About sitting in a laundromat for three hours to watch an elderly couple fold shirts in complete silence, like it was a kind of holy ceremony.

Each page was a record of tiny rebellions.

Walking a new route every day. Making up fake names when ordering coffee. Leaving oranges in phone booths.

Then there was a question scrawled in messy pen at the bottom of a page:

**“Do you ever do things just to see what happens?”**

That’s when I realized this wasn’t a diary-it was a game.

So I wrote back.

**“Yes. Today I picked up your notebook.”**

I left it where I found it, red scarf and all. Came back the next day. Another entry.

This time, from someone else.

A woman who called herself “Wisteria.” She'd found the book that afternoon. She’d read my message. She added one of her own.

**“I once ate nothing but foods that started with ‘B’ for a whole week. Bananas. Borscht. Blueberry bagels. It got weird. But I kept going.”**

I wrote again. Told her that was bold. That I respected the borscht.

That was the beginning.

The notebook became a kind of traveling confession booth. No names. No dates. Just stories, dares, thoughts scribbled in different hands. We passed it back and forth—sometimes days apart, sometimes weeks. I never saw who dropped it off before me or picked it up after.

But somehow, we were all talking.

We left poems. Doodles. Coordinates to weird corners of the city: a rusted carousel in the Bronx, an abandoned stairwell behind a bakery in Queens that smelled like cinnamon and mold.

I started living differently. Slower. Stranger. On purpose.

Then one day, the notebook was gone.

No scarf. No note. Just a cracked step and a little bit of rain.

I didn’t panic. I just missed it.

Until a letter showed up at my apartment. No return address. Just a wax seal stamped with a bicycle.

Inside: a Polaroid of a group of people—seven of us—laughing on the roof of what looked like a parking garage. In the center: the notebook, still wrapped in the red scarf.

On the back, it read:

**“Thank you for playing. Want to meet the others?”**

I did.

That was six months ago.

Now we pass around a different object every month. A rubber duck. A mixtape. A single glove. The game never ends, and the rules keep changing.

But the spirit stays the same:

**Do weird things. See what happens.**

And always leave room for strangers to join.",1,1749763706.0,stories,0,0.67,False

I hadn’t had coffee since March! I was eating a lot less on zep, but i had such strong food aversions that salad and eggs and most healthy stuff besides fruit was just repulsive. But today i thought man, i could really go for a Cobb salad. On zep my food aversions were like pregnancy level aversions. I’d cook dinner and then immediately be repulsed when it was time to eat, smell McDonald’s and feel sick, but i definitely seem to be feeling more normal then I have been.

I'd ideally like a modern or newly renovated apartment within a 15-20 minute walk of Equinox Domino. 

Must-haves : Dishwasher, in-unit washer/dryer, and AC. 

Nice to have : Floor to ceiling window, lots or natural light, a decent to big kitchen (i like to cook)

As I work remotely, I need a room that can comfortably fit a queen bed and a desk.

My budget is up to $3000 for my share. I'm very clean, tidy, and not a big party person. I'm hoping to find friendly roommates and not just housemates. Happy to grab coffee or a drink to chat!

Last night I (m30) met a girl (F28) at a social event for a language learning group in my city. The group holds 3 “classes” and one social meet up each month. I’ve gone to a few of the classes starting 2 months ago but this is my first social. There was a girl there that caught my eye who I had never seen before we shared a few glances and started chatting up, although due to the nature of these things it’s kind of a mixer group setting so we would talk for a bit, talk to other people and then find ourselves talking again. I approached her first and at first she seemed a little shy and avoided eye contact but as the night went on she seemed much more comfortable engaging one on one with me. This is her second social event and she says she doesn’t show up for the classes, I encouraged her to show up but she said that she was too shy in our target language so she probably wouldn’t.

I think she’s cute! And she seems easy to talk to. She was very nice although our conversations weren’t super deep so I can’t say we connected deeply on anything, but it was fairly lighthearted and it seemed like we had a good back and forth.

This group is organized primarily through instagram and we exchanged instagram follows as it seems like that’s kinda the way things go. I didn’t want to ask for her number because it felt kind of forward since we were in a big group and the purpose is not necessarily to find a date or anything.

My question is: do I hit her up on insta in a day or two, or do I let life take its course and see if I see her again in a month at the next social. I want to ask her if she would like to get some coffee or dinner or something 

People tend to fall off these groups often, and I tend to fuck these things up. I’m scared of either coming off too strong too soon or to let too much time pass and never see her again.

Her not wanting to go to the class after i encouraged her kinda makes me think i should look elsewhere to be honest. Although i might be reading too deep into it.

Single, working, and figuring it all out one coffee at a time.

I’m Palestinian and it’s a big part of who I am, so I’d naturally appreciate someone who shares that background—it just makes the connection feel a little deeper. But of course, with respect and love for everyone.

Looking for someone in the 29–35 age range who’s got his life (mostly) together. Communication, generosity, and strong morals go a long way with me. I’m drawn to people who are emotionally mature—someone who can handle life’s curveballs with patience rather than drama. I really value consistency, too; if your words and actions match even when things get hectic, that’s a big win in my book. Bonus points if you’re a family-oriented guy who’s honest and open-minded (within reason) and knows how to have a calm conversation when things get tough.

What won’t work? Laziness, arrogance, jealousy, temper issues, or a lack of ambition. Also, being a practising Muslim is really important to me—non-negotiable.

A bit about me:

Educated, well-traveled, and always up for a deep conversation or a spontaneous trip (or both).

I love the simple things—coffee, sunsets, bookstores—but I won’t say no to the occasional splurge.

Super logical, realistic, and honest to a fault.

I can be a little opinionated, but I’m also the first to admit when I’m wrong.

Sarcasm is basically my second language.


Hobbies? I’ve got a few:

If I’m not reading, I’m probably yelling at my screen while gaming.

Love board games—approach with caution if you’re not competitive.

I try to stay active-ish (walking, swimming), but I won’t pretend I’m an athlete.

Baking is my therapy. Expect cookies.

1l9yd55,https://i.redd.it/jnh7ssl2dk6f1.jpeg,RIP Lapis M20. I’ll need to crit 7 of my remaining meals.,"Thursday, post lunch. 

Cooking Hidden Power Perk Up Stew gets me ~150,000 and there are 10 meals remaining. ~1,500,000. 

I did some math and since I’ve crit’d 2 meals that means I made around 400,000 points in berries and skills so far in the middle of the week (which honestly doesn’t sound right).

2,350,000 + 400,000 + 1,500,000 = 4,250,000

I’m basically 1,000,000 short. So not even close. I need 7 crits to bridge the gap, and again, I’ve only gotten 2. Maybe Sunday crits can help, but I can’t rely on that.

My poor Dedenne is working entirely off of Speed up nature, Helping Speed S, Skill Trigger S and a main skill level 3. 

I think I’ll replay this in a couple weeks when we get the stronger crits and I’ll pop another GCT. I can always go to Cyan another week for Farfetch’d or wherever it spawns. Does it spawn at Lapis?

Next time I’ll pre-farm enough Coffee so I don’t need Vikavolt on the field ever so my Quaquaval and BFS Victrebell can be on the field all the time getting me useful berries instead of rotating out. 

Coffee: 336

Mushrooms: 150

Soybeans: 100

Tomatoes: 100

Quagsire also needs the help. With that buffer the 3 of them should not be worried about running out. 

Instead of swapping my Gardevoir out for my 4th ingredient mon when everyone is sitting at 120+% I can switch to my maxed out double skill trigger Golduck. Sadly my Espeon is only at Lv 4.

QRding is a simple self-hosted QR code generator. It includes templates for creating QR codes for sharing WiFi credentials, contact cards and text or links. In the long-term the goal is to build an automation system around QR codes which allows you to trigger custom actions, track actions or habits and send notifications when a scan event is triggered/not triggered. Github repo: [https://github.com/rishikanthc/qrding](https://github.com/rishikanthc/qrding)

# Features

* QR code for sharing WiFi credentials
* QR code for sharing contact cards
* QR code for adding events to calendars
* QR code for generic link sharing and text
* Customize size of QR code image
* Customize color of QR codes

# Cool ideas for using QR codes

I highly recommend getting a label maker to print out QR codes and stick them on specific locations or objects depending on the type of usage.

1. **Connect to WiFi** Encode SSID, security type, and password so scanning immediately joins the network (no manual typing).
2. **Add a Contact (vCard)** Embed a full “virtual business card” (name, phone, email, address). Scanning prompts “Add to Contacts.”
3. **Compose an SMS** Encode SMSTO:+15551234567:Your message here so the user’s messaging app opens with the recipient and body pre-filled.
4. **Dial a Phone Number** Embed an VEVENT (title, start/end, location) so the calendar app offers to add it straight into the user’s schedule.
5. **Send an Email** Use MATMSG:TO:[you@example.com](mailto:you@example.com);SUB:Subject here;BODY:Email body;; or MAILTO: syntax to open the email composer with fields pre-filled.
6. **Geo-Coordinates / Map Location** Encode geo:37.786971,-122.399677 so the mapping app opens at those coordinates.
7. **App Deep-Link or Custom URI Scheme** e.g. myapp://product/1234 launches a specific view inside an installed app (if it supports that URI scheme), or falls back to a URL.
8. **Bluetooth Pairing** Some devices support BLUETOOTH:MAC-address;PIN:1234; → triggers pairing dialogue for headsets or smart devices.
9. **Text-Only Payload** Plain text that the user can copy to clipboard—ideal for coupons, short instructions, or secret messages, without any network call.

# Roadmap for potential advanced use cases

* Save and browse generated QR codes
* Automations via webhooks and integration with other apps like Home Assistant, Ntfy, discord etc.
   * Track events/habits and trigger notifications - For eg. QR code stuck on medicine cabinet. Scan everytime you take meds. If the code hasn’t been scanned before a pre-set deadline, send a reminder/notification.
   * Trigger specific evens when code is scanned
      * **Smart Home Scene Triggers**: Place QR stickers around the house. Scanning the “Movie Night” code dims lights, closes blinds, and fires up the home theater. Scan “Good Morning” in your bedroom to raise shades, start the coffee maker, and read you the day’s weather.
      * **Equipment & Tool Checkout**: In a makerspace or home workshop, each tool has its own QR. Scanning when you borrow it logs you as the current user. If you haven’t returned (i.e. scanned it back) within your allotted time, an automated reminder pings you.
      * **Plant & Pet Care Scheduling**: QR on each plant’s pot or pet’s food bin: scan to log watering or feeding. If no scan happens after the plant’s ideal watering interval (e.g. 7 days) or pet’s mealtime window, your smart home assistant reminds you.
      * **On-Demand How-To Guides**: Affix QR codes on appliances or furniture. Scanning the code launches the PDF manual.
      * **Vehicle & Machinery Maintenance Logs**: Under the hood or on factory equipment: scan QR to instantly log an oil change, safety inspection, or filter replacement. The system then auto-schedules the next service reminder based on mileage or hours run.
      * **Inventory management**: QR codes on pantry items connect to your home-inventory app. Scanning the last bag of flour or coffee bean container logs the “out-of-stock” event.

If you like the project please consider giving a star. It would mean a lot for me. Please feel free to drop suggestions or feature requests or other ideas you can come up with to use QR codes. Requests to add specific templates are most welcome as it's relatively easy to add them.

Like day 2 I started feeling jittery, especially when combined with coffee (I drink 12 oz in the morning). Also noticed a higher heart rate and increasing resting heart rate as reported by my Fitbit. I had a follow-up with my psychiatrist 3 weeks later. At that time, the increased heart rate seemed to resolving. Discussed options to mitigate this, including possible supplements and cutting back on caffeine. He checked my blood pressure and it was fine.

In the week after my heart rate actually started getting better (and I actually felt like the medicine was working less also) but then shot back up. It hasn't gotten better since. 

I generally think this medicine is helping me but the heart rate is concerning. Generally, my resting heart rate is averaging around 78, with it jumping to about 90 if I am sitting around working, around 100 when I am on my feet working on something (cooking, laundry, etc). It will quickly shoot too to 115 or 120 if I do anything slightly strenuous. 

I guess this is 10-15 bpm higher than I normally run. When I am not experiencing heightened anxiety my resting heart rate has historically been in the low 60s. I am currently laying here in bed watching tv at 95 bpm. Not only are all these rates higher, but I feel like my heart rate is a lot more reactive and will even stay even higher for nearly 24 hours after exercise.

I decided to go off the deep end and cut caffeine completely to see what would happen. I am only on day 2 of this (sucks!). I am not sure how long I need to go without caffeine to see an effect. 

I have another appointment with my psychiatrist in July, but I am thinking about messaging him sooner. I'm not sure how long I need to give the no caffeine before I can conclude it's not making an impact.

I developed feelings quickly. Just felt like someone i had good chemistry with, someone i wanted in my life. We met up for coffee a week later. And then after this was when i snooped for her on facebook and came across stuff that hinted at her having a boyfriend. There wasnt signs on instagram from when i added her.

As the months go on, we start hanging out more. We've hung out a lot recently. And guess what, she still hasn't told me directly or mentioned having a boyfriend. A fiance, no less. Long distance.

So she's leaving to another state soon. And so i felt compelled the other day when we were hanging out to finally address this. So i asked her about it, and asked why she hadnt told me.

She got defensive and said im just her film friend to talk about movies with. I guess saying theres no reason to mention her boyfriend. But she always talks to me about her sister, her family?

So after this conversation, yeah. She didnt respond back me yesterday.

She finally reached back to me just now. Everything seemed fine, we were kind of ignoring whatever was bothering us and talking about other stuff. And then i see she blocked me on facebook....

We're still good on instagram and other places.

I couldnt help but ask her about it. Like heyy i thought we were good, whats up with facebook?

and this is what she said: ""yea, i think we'll just continue to be film friends. But everything else was weird to me idk i cant, im already dealing with a lot of shit""

that could mean sooo many things. Like did she realize i do in fact like her and basically friendzoned me? or was she just weirded out and wants at least some place where we're not connected? 

i didnt ask her what she meant exactly. i did tell her that if its because of what i said, that i understand. Cause facebook is the only place where she mentions her boyfriend.

we are hanging out Monday. 

My point with all this is that yes, i have feelings for her and it thus made things difficult for me. I havent told her how i feel. I wanted to other day, but i dont think its a good idea anymore. She'll move soon. We'll still be friends but it will be different and i've already accepted that.

*by E.P. Daly*

My friend Jim is a good guy.  
No family,  
but he’s got a dog he loves very much.  
He’s well-read  
and a pretty good artist too.  

He’s always quick with a smile  
and generous with his laughter.  

We had coffee the other day  
at his place on 14th Street.  
He had finished the crossword in *The Times*  
and was about halfway through *Infinite Jest*,  
(I never did understand that book).  

We talked about Kerouac  
and who’s running for mayor  
for a bit before I had to head home.  

I hope he finds a home soon.

1l9xxwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1l9xxwr/aita_for_the_break_up_between_my_best_friend_and/,AITA for the Break Up between my Best Friend and her Boyfriend and destroying our friendship?,"Sry for my English, it's my second language. 

This is not a story about how I cheated with the Boyfriend so they broke up. This Story is longer, complicated and juicer. So buckle up. It will be a wild ride. 

This happened 10+ Years ago. My Best Friend Lena (FN) and I were around 15 -16 years old. 
We knew each other around 8 years. Where Friends for 5 and BF for like 3 Years. 
Lena had a Boyfriend bevor Stephen(FN) and our Friendship was fine. But I will say I didn't like her First Boyfriend very much. But her second Boyfriend Stephen was so much more 🤢.

From the beginning he flirted with me. Lena just needed to turn around and he tried to come near me, spoke inappropriate jokes and was just an A*hole. I said clearly that I don't want that and that I had no interest in him. That he was the Boyfriend of my Best Friend. But he didn't stop. 
Lena new about his behavior but overlooked it. And I did see how happy she looked and how much in love. So I didn't try to talk her into a break up. But I said I didn't like Stephen. In fact I mistrusted him. And there was a reason for that.

I new Stephen way bevor she new him. He was the little Brother of my neighbor. I was 12 and he was around 17 or 18 as I met him the first time. He came over a lot, and as I was often at Home. He new he could meet me there. He was overly friendly and looking back a bit to touchy. He said we were practically engaged. It wasn't more than that as I blocked every time he tried to come near me or win my favor. I didn't like him. But I didn't see what he tried to do and how lucky I was as nothing more happened.
 I believe after 6 Months he just vanished and I didn't ask why. As I said I had no interest in him. 

I didn't tell Lena about it. At that time I believe others didn't believe me if I tell the truth so why bother. 
But Lena new that Stephen was 5 years behind bars. Allegedly because he molested a Child at a camp. 
I do believe that he could have done that crime. But Lena wanted to believe that Stephen was innocent. 
So it was not my call to make.

And Stephen had learned at least one lesson. On the day Lena turned 16. (Legal Age for Sex with ok from the younger person) He gifted her, her first Time. 
Lena looks happy and in love, and apart from his creepy behavior I hoped he was a good boyfriend to Lena. 
I love to see my Friends happy, I would do so much for them just to see them truly happy. 
But there are things I won't do. 

One of them was(is) a threesome. 
Stephen and Lena were together for a view Month. I visited them rarely, but after a view weeks I visited Lena. We, Lena, Stephen and me sitting in her room. 
I can't remember how the situation began. But I remember he pinned me on the bed. I struggled but I could free myself by pushing and wiggling me of the Bed. Lena didn't say a word, and I felt betrayed. It was scary as hell and I believe if he meant it, I would not have freed myself. In Lenas eyes was something that told me something was of. Stephen left the room and Lena and I were alone. For the first time since she was together with him. There she told me Stephen wanted a threesome with her and me. I instantly said eww, no, never. I saw her and new that Stephen hat talked her up to ask. And Lena was a Person that couldn't say no. 

But this is not the reason they broke up, or why our friendship broke. This is only the Beginning.

I know at this point there are a lot of red flags and I should have run away, or told a grown up what happened, but I couldn't. 
I spoke with Lena and she didn't want to and I just couldn't go against her wishes. 
I did told her that I didn't want to be near her Boyfriend. Or at least not that often. So our main communication was on ICQ (WhatsApp bevor WhatsApp) 

That was ok. At least for a moment. Until I had a friend request from Stephen. He had stolen my ICQ number from Lenas ICQ. And from there on Desaster struck.

I trie to give a general example how the chats went. But my memory is a little fuzzy, as it is a long time ago. And yes, now I know I should have blocked him from day One. But I was young and thought what could happen.

In the beginning he was friendly. Tried to say sorry and so on. My response was minimal. Then he tried over a view days to say yes to a coffee date between him and me. I always said no. But I was at least friendly. Even if his was creepy AF! He said I don't need to be ashamed about my body, that it's ok if it was hairy (I never told him anything about my body!) and so on. At this point I was irritated and I told him I didn't say anything about my body to him and that I didn't want anything to do with him.
But he didn't have up and at some point I had enough. I said that I would not met him. That he was the Boyfriend of my Best friend and I would never betray her like that. I probably wasn't as friendly.
The instant answer from him was. He has broken up with Lena. 
As I was writing with Lena in ICQ and she didn't say anything I asked her if it was true. She denied id. Until 10 minutes later as she said Stephen had just broken up with her. 
She cried and was heartbroken. And I believed it was my fault for being so mean to Stephen or worse make Stephen believe that I would go out with him if he broke up with Lena. Lena said something along these lines to me to. That Stephen broke up because I was mean. 

So I tried to fix it. I wrote Stephen that he didn't need to break up with Lena, that I was sorry. That I would make it good. I would make them both a romantic dinner as an apology. 
He became creepy again and said I should cook in underwear to make it good. I said no I would not do that. And I never did! But it was a hard chat. One one hand be their for my best friend who is heartbroken and on the other hand trying to make Stephen go back on that break up. 
At least I succeeded. They came back together. I know I should have let it ended there. But I couldn't see how hurt and heartbroken Lena was. The breakup didn't last more than 30 minutes.

But after that my friendship with Lena would break.
I told her I couldn't meet her when Stephen is there. And she said it was ok. We could meet alone.
But we never met again. Every time we make a date she cancelled shortly before. Said she had forgotten another Termin. Like a Doctor's appointment. 
One Day, after she cancelled again. My Dad called home and I answered the phone. My Dad was surprised why I answered, he thought I would sit by our neighbors with Lena and Stephen. I said I didn't even know that they were there. And I played it as it was no big deal. But after the telephone call I walked with our Dog outside. I new I could look through the window and the in the living room. And there they were. Sitting on the couch and talking, having fun. 
Lena said she had a Doctor's appointment that day, that she cancelled our meeting because of that. 
I had a feeling that our friendship was dying. That she was lying about her appointments that she forgot. On that day I decided not to call her again. That she needed to call out to me if she wanted to keep the friendship alive. But she didn't. 

Year's later she called out to me. She hat a new Boyfriend (someone who was 10 Years older than her.) and had moved to a different city. She said that Stephen was the reason she cancelled the appointments and didn't reach out to me. That other stuff happened and she feared to call out to me again. It was her new Boyfriend that gave her the courage to do so.  
But even after we tried to be friends again, it didn't work out. 

I know it's a long post. But thank you for reading.
But I do wonder if I was the Asshole for breaking up my Best Friend and her then Boyfriend and so causing our friendship to be destroyed? ",0,1749762399.0,AITAH,2,0.5,False

1l9xvx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1l9xvx6/tips_for_those_stuck_and_looking_for_roles/,Tips for those stuck and looking for roles,"Some tips for the struggle.

 1. It's not you. 

Demand for ux and especially research and customer centric innovation is at an all time low - worldwide. Partly low economic conditions mean smaller budgets and very low tolerance for change = new risks = research and design. 

2. Internal hiring and cut backs

Jobs get advertised without a committed need. They are being filled internally or withdrawn because budget for headcount disappeared from quarterly Capex ( project money) . We're still seeing constant lay-offs and ""restructures"" to get rid of opex cost too (perm team money) . Especially in design and research. Again no risk, no innovation = no work for design. 

3. Culture change

There is a notable shift in corporate culture to prioritise delivery and engineering not customers and innovation. Progress over perfection. Ship not iterate. Engineering and data teams subtly don't see value in design and research vs their own contributions. That makes a difference in the overall team planning and shaping per initiative. A symptom of this is design and research teams being moved out of delivery or digital org structures to marketing and strategy. = out of the main flow of funding and delivery. 

So what can you do? 

Reframe your value. How are you helping deliver  outcomes faster? How can you help measure value of the outputs in real time? How can you track roi and enable agile pivots? Avoid preaching the customer religion at people who don't share that belief. Identify YOUR buyers values and biases. 
That said with demand being low all of this might be mute unless you can get in a door. 

Disrupt and reinvent yourself. OK... market needs have changed and as a product your past skills (not you personally) might not be in demand. But you are more than your last job title. Try to abstract and 'do discovery' on yourself as a product. What other skills and experience do you have? What are you interested in? What new gaps in the market would you enjoy heading toward? What was your passion starting this before your first role? 

Find community. Most of all you're not alone. The lockdowns are over. Get out of the house. Have coffees meet people, attend meet ups and conferences. Take courses. Join sports groups. Don't let this be your focus for life. And don't let yourself be alone in the world. You are more than your latest employment contract. 

---

If it helps the trajectory for ai means a lot of all of the digital delivery pipe will be sitting a home in the same place. I see active and real steps to replace junior engineer roles with automation and ai agents today. We're planning for 3-5 years dropping more than half staff. There just won't be a need for a typing pool of humans analysing data and writing code. You have the opportunity to be exiting the downward curve when everyone else is just entering it.

I’ve always struggled with cold hands and feet! My whole life I just thought I had poor circulation. Could i be hypothyroid? Estrogen dominant? Been dealing with some gnarly symptoms the past ~2 years…brain fog being the main culprit. Which doesn’t sound bad but idk how to explain it other than I feel like I’ve lost double digit IQ points and my testosterone plummeted.. I had my TSH checked in April 2023 and it was at 1.73! Test levels were 790. Uhm cortisol was 16.1mcg/dL. I had a bunch of stuff checked and everything was in range, after a few visits and I thoroughly voiced my concerns, I was referred to a psychiatrist to be put on psych meds. I haven’t seen a doctor since and actually did a 10 day fast in June 2023 which kind of helped, like a lot! It moved the needle more than anything else but still not to where I know I should be. Maybe I’m dealing w a gut issue/mold/candida but I really don’t have resources to see a functional/naturopathic doctor right now. Hopefully soon 🤞 

I don’t even have a very high tolerance for research at the moment. I’m not lazy, I really do feel metabolically impaired.. I workout and have a manual labor job but my brain function, it’s in the toilet. Any advice? Where to start? Things I’ve figured I should start doing are: daily carrot salad w EVOO/ACV/salt… aspirin (dose? I just take four 81mg pills w coffee) Coconut oil in coffee w milk/honey… uhm what else… I’m not too sure! I don’t tolerate B vitamins (methylated and non methylated) as they affect my sleep and just make me feel weird.. I have eaten beef liver and didn’t notice any negative effects so maybe I can do that once a week. I should probably start eating oysters too.. I’ve not done a lot of research on NDT or have a good source but is that something I should look into? Anyways, any basic advice you can give to help me would be greatly appreciated. My goal is to get to a point where I can comb thru all the information myself but idk. My head spins when I think too hard and it hasn’t always been like this I swear I used to be able to research, read and learn whatever! The past two years have been really difficult.. 

Also, what is the philosophy behind taking cyproheptadine? I’m looking into getting an RX for that soon, hopefully. I’ve read on Twitter it’s been promoted by this ray peat guy… I just wanna take it bc I’ve been struggling to get good sleep for a while now and it’s supposedly good for not just insomnia, but it’s one of the few medications that can also improve sleep quality.. Is there a specific reason why it’s touted by Ray Peats and his followers?",1,1749762154.0,raypeat,1,1.0,False

Ideal schedule would be every 2 weeks. Weekday evenings or Saturday afternoons. Not looking to do any newer D&D really though. 

Happy to meet up for a beer or coffee to suss things out and figure out if folks are compatible and on the same page with what kind of game we would want to do. I just prefer a steady group to the one-horse at bars that seems to have become pretty common this past five to ten years.

About me: I'm mid-40s, punk rock sort of background and music is still a primary pursuit. Currently trying to find work as a technical writer, which may necessitate life upheaval depending on how that plays out. Otherwise focused on living a healthy life with my two dachshunds down in Beechmont. Finally, I'm not a bigot and so I obviously don't want to game with that energy at the table. 

Other game system ideas: Torchbearer, Burning Wheel, Twilight:2000 (any edition), Ars Magica (3rd-5th ed), The One Ring (2nd edition), AD&D (1st or 2nd edition). But OSE is a really fun game that is easy to pick up since it's basically Basic D&D, which is the lingua franca of gaming.

1l9xqf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreeceTravel/comments/1l9xqf8/2_week_peloponnese_driving_trip_report/,2 week Peloponnese & Driving Trip Report,"(I hope this doesn't post twice; I tried posting one and got a note it had been automatically removed due to a swear near the end of the post (woops!!) so here it is without!) 

I just got back from 2 weeks in the Peloponnese with friends. Before I went, I spent a lot of time trawling this subreddit for info since it was my first time in Greece, so I thought I'd share it forward!

**Driving:** We were a group booking one large accommodation to use as a 'home base.' Because of this, we decided to book two rental cars, one a little bigger. Turned out our diesel midsize was more fuel efficient than the other little car, but we did mostly highway driving.

I'm Canadian, I've roadtripped briefly to the states, and I've also driven for a couple years in the Bahamas. Out of the four countries I've driven in now, Greece was by far the best. Take that with a healthy heaping of salt; we only drove briefly in Athens or any city/village along the way, and did most of our driving on the highway, but I was shocked at how courteous the drivers were in Greece compared to Canada. If I'm being generous, 70-80% of cars in Canada will move to the right on the highway when they're done passing, or if they see someone coming up behind. Compare that with the SINGLE car we came across in 2 weeks who refused to move over and had people passing them on the right. Having experience driving for long hours, winding mountain roads, narrow roads, and being someone who actually likes driving, all probably helped a lot!

In towns, like in small villages near our rental and in Athens itself, it was a bit more touch and go with some very narrow roads. Compared to North America, people in Greece (and Europe in general, probably) have a much better understanding of how wide their vehicle is and how much clearance they actually need. It was closer driving than I'm generally used to but at no point did I feel unsafe (my passengers might have had a different experience; it's nice being the one in control, but we were unscathed!) The only road that was challenging was Patras -> Olympia thanks to the passing lanes and numerous tractors and trucks you could get stuck behind if you didn't pass in time. Pay attention and be proactive and you'll be fine!

**Athens:**

Temple of Poseidon, Cape Sounion: We did this day 1. It was cool, but compared to other archeological sites for the same 20 euros, didn't match up for us. Having more time and visiting at sunrise/sunset would probs be nicer.

Acropolis Museum & Acropolis Daytrip: 9am for the museum gave us one beautiful, quiet hour; by 10 it was full of tours. 11am for the Acropolis wasn't ideal, and we were in a sea of people walking to the top, but still enjoyed it. If your schedule allows it, for sure take advice from the people recommending earlier (or later) time slots. It was windy at the top and not super hot the day we went. You can bring water.

Driving: We drove in and parked at Syggrou-Fix; easy and convenient! From there we walked to the Acropolis, Plaka, and back.

**Patras, Kalogria, Aigio:** Our rental was near Aigio, 20-30 minutes from Patras. We had everything we needed nearby but were removed from the big city, and really loved it. Between daytrips we stayed at the villa to swim and relax. We visited Aigio, Selianitika, and Longos for food and swimming, and the area is really nice and quiet. Against most of what I'd read, most people did not speak any English (or very little), and what little Greek we did speak took us a long way. There was a lot of me telling someone I spoke a little Greek and them confirming, in Greek, that they spoke a little English haha. I wish I'd learned more because I would have had ample time to practice. Food words for groceries and relating to coffee (sugar, milk, plain, etc) help a lot!!

Favs: Kalogria Beach/Strofylia National Park, Mycenean Cemetery of Voudeni

**Olympia:** 10am for Olympia wasn't too busy, even with tours. The museum is beautiful, quiet, and cool and the grounds are quite large. We even ran the length of the stadium there. Had a nice lunch in town.

**Delphi**: 8am was perfect, but even then we were struggling a bit to stay ahead of small tour groups; still much preferred since when we were leaving, the place was crushed with BIG groups. The museum for Delphi's archeological site was my favourite, and we had one of the nicest views for lunch at a restaurant in town looking out at the valley and nearby Itea. We drove briefly through Arachova and I felt right away I could easily spend a week there alone.

**Mystras:** We spent one night away from our rental to do an overnight in Monemvasia. On the way, we stopped at Mystras. It was about 30C and we hiked to the top from the lower gate; really felt like a proper hike and we took plenty of stops to drink water (store it in the freezer overnight beforehand!!). My partner managed it in flip flops but he's a seasoned pro; I'd definitely recommend actual shoes. An old hiking injury of mine started to flare up on our way down. It's quite the walk if you do the whole thing but also felt well worth the cost. This was a major highlight for me and it wasn't busy at all, but maybe doing it midday in the heat helped hahaha.

**Monemvasia:** We parked at the end of the road and walked the 10 mins up to the gate and stayed overnight in a hotel there. This was also a favourite among our group. We loved exploring the streets and meeting the cats and chatting to shopkeepers. We had a great dip here in the ocean and the best food all trip (not that it wasn't good everywhere, but the slightly fancier dishes we had were a real treat). When we went out for dinner at 6pm the restaurants were quiet, and at 10:30 when we popped out on our balcony to stargaze, the rooftop patio across the way was completely full. Late nights are really the vibe it seems; we're just sleepy 30-somethings. Definitely could have spent longer in Monemvasia.

**Nafplio:** I had high anticipations for Nafplio and I feel like a daytrip from 2 hours away doesn't serve it best. We did a walk around the cliffy/rock-fally area, had brunch, walked through the shopping streets, and finished at Arvanitia beach. It was more fancy/resorty than I expected but that might just be due to where we were. I wish I'd had more time to explore it properly and see the forts, but it was also way too hot to even think about walking up there.

**Takeaway:**

\- Tolls add up, but the roads are well worth it  
\- The handmade souvenirs are our favourites (ceramics, linen)  
\- 8am time tickets are worth it, but maybe not needed for Olympia  
\- Delphi & Olympia had our favourite museums  
\- Mystras is worth a stop  
\- Not everything is on Google; our favourite place for takeout gyros had no listing  
\- Already in the first week of June, the weather shifted hot. In the last few days of May our pool was cold and we even had a night of rain. Then the highs started to settle around 30, 31, 32, and we were sweating. I'd packed a bunch of linen and it saved my life. Sunscreen too. When the UV goes up the sun does not mess around. I was getting complacent by the end of the trip and got burned.

Cannot wait to come back and visit the northern mainland and maybe some islands one day. We loved it. Hope this helps provide info for anyone worrying about driving or looking at visiting the Peloponnese! :)",6,1749761898.0,GreeceTravel,2,1.0,False

1l9xp2y,https://v.redd.it/holvwhh38k6f1,"Impossible Dial In, Always Over-Extracted [Diletta Mio & Baratza Sette]","Seemingly Impossible Dial In, Need Help!

My family has had our espresso setup for over a year now: Seattle Coffee Gear’s Diletta Mio Espresso Machine, and the Baratza Sette 270 Espresso Grinder. I really only ever am making myself VERY (much more than average) sweet & milky lattes, so how bitter the espresso ended up never really mattered to me. Recently, however, I have been getting into more pure espressos and drinks. As ive gotten deep in the rabbit whole of espresso over the past few weeks, watching nearly every James Hoffman video available, I know I am completely failing in my results (i would guess many of my earlier brews to be in the 1:4 ratio range after a 32 second brew, including the first 4 seconds of no drip). I have tried numerous times to dial in my espresso (spending a good 2 hours total) and have yet to get anything in the 1:2 ratio range, or anything remotely enjoyable. Heres some more details:

I have mainly attempted to dial in with two different beans: first, the Lavazza Super Crema Beans, second, Blue Bottles Espresso Roast Beans. With the Super Crema, I had the grinder on the absolute finest settings, grinding 18g at first, and hit my 1:2 ratio of 36g output in only ~18 seconds. I tried upping the dose to 19g and was still getting near 40g output by ~22 seconds. I had a similar experience with the Blue Bottle Espresso Roast, though I bumped the dosage to 19.5g, and still hit 40g output by ~23 seconds. 

From all the videos ive watched, I seem to be struggling more than usual with this. Im a bit stuck as ive already gone as fine as possible with my grind, and have basically filled up the basket as much as I can with it still screwing in tightly. Both my grinder and machine, aswell as the beans, seem more than capable of producing great espresso. Does anyone have any advice on this?

Im happy to share anything more! I really want to brew my first incredible cup. I also provided a video example, in it I only use 18g, but as I mentioned ive tried going up with no luck…",2,1749761800.0,espresso,32,0.75,False

But today I was out with a friend who has just had her second and it made me really doubt myself again. I loved being able to give my daughter my attention and being a little team with her in one hand and my iced coffee in another, meanwhile my friend (who is doing absolutely amazing at having 2 kids btw) was not able to do this and I just wonder if we should potentially ruin a good thing (a slightly more laid back and relaxed life (in context 😅)) to have a second. 

I don’t know if the constant “what if” if we don’t have a second will just consume us but then don’t want to push ourselves into more chaos if we don’t need to. ",2,1749761750.0,Shouldihaveanother,3,1.0,False
1l9xo1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/FODMAPS/comments/1l9xo1p/bad_food_problems/,Bad food problems,"Hey y'all... So I've had stomach/digestive issues for years that I've just kind of dealt with, but in trying to fix it now. 

Basically on the daily I've had gas/diarrhea, and several months ago I went gluten free which helped a lot with the gas - which was seriously a problem. 

I was motivated to post because these issues surfaced today and totally derailed my plans for the day. 

However, even since removing gluten from my diet, sometimes I still get gas and diarrhea. Yesterday I had corn tortillas, which gave me bad gas - but that was basically done before I went to bed. Woke up this morning and had an apple and a coffee, then had 3 baked chicken drumsticks with BBQ sauce for lunch. About an hour after that my guts turned to liquid and I've been in and out of the bathroom with diarrhea and can't really leave the apartment. 

Is something I ate today a common cause of these issues? I can usually have coffee without issues. Is it corn? The BBQ sauce had some corn products in it. Any thoughts are much appreciated. (Also I'm broke without insurance so doctor isn't an option right now).",1,1749761725.0,FODMAPS,4,0.67,False

1l9xmg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1l9xmg6/how_can_we_make_rdeaf_better/,How can we make r/deaf better?,"r/deaf is a community of 43,000+ members and is maintained by 3 human moderators and an automod bot. I've been thinking about making this post for months and it's long overdue.

We strive to maintain and curate this subreddit for the deaf community at large. We do have rules in place to help maintain this subreddit. Here are the rules as of 12 June 2025. We can make changes based on feedback from the community.

   1. Research, surveys, etc must be pre-approved by the moderators. Asking for non-medical advice is OK.
1. No self-promoting or asking for money. -- No buying or selling!
2. No posting about ideas for new technological products that serve the deaf.
3. No asking for medical advice
4. No ""how do deaf people think"" posts.
5. No ""self-pitying"" posts.
6. Don't post sign language questions here.
7. Use the search engine.
8. No lipreading requests.
9. Videos must have captions or transcripts.
10. Limit crossposting. No karmafarming or brigading.
11. Shitpost / Low Effort / Mod's choice.

**I want to add some of my personal thoughts and opinions on some of these rules as they stand.**

* Rule # 1 says research and surveys must be pre-approved by moderators. We[ currently have a moratorium on these requests](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1i4gk9n/new_total_ban_on_research_affective_immediately/) because it became overwhelming. Issues being urgent requests to help with a school assignment that should have been done weeks before, requests that put a burden on the deaf community with zero compensation, and outright offensive/insensitive/outdated language used in the surveys.
   * We generally try to direct people to r/askdeaf. We are not affiliated in any way.
   * Should we resume allowing research and survey posts?
   * What guidelines should we hold these posts to?
   * Transparency requirements? Who is using and benefiting from the research?
   * Should we require some kind of compensation for participants? ($5 gift cards for coffee, etc)
   * In the past we sent out a Google Form for those wanting to do research to filter out the requests and streamline the approval process. We can maybe tweak the questions and resume doing this.
* Rule # 3. We get a ton of posts regarding ideas for assistive technology. These typically have good intentions and are profit driven. Many of the ideas are not as original as thought, aren't actually useful to deaf people, or not needed if things were made to be accessible to begin with.
   * Should there be a place for this? If so, where?
* Rule # 5. No ""how do deaf people think"" posts. WE GET A LOT OF THESE and it's very overwhelming and taxing on the community. Hearing people are welcome here but remember that this is a deaf space.
   * Again, r/askdeaf is there for this. We are not affiliated in any way.
* Rule # 7. Don't post sign language questions here. I know this may seem silly at first but remember this is a worldwide community. There are many different sign languages and it's not universal. This isn't the right place to post ASL questions or ask for free help with your homework. Generalized questions can be asked but most should be directed to their own specific subreddits such as r/asl, r/auslan, r/BSL, etc. The automod bot will flag the few sign language posts that would allow so please let us know.
* Rule # 9 No lipreading requests. WE GET A LOT OF THESE. Most are low effort and from hearing people outside the community. Lipreading is not perfect and not every deaf people can, it's a tool that is used in combination with other context clues. We don't exist to serve hearing people. At least offer some form of compensation.

**Additionally, I want to take a moment to mention the other pertinent subreddits. We are not affiliated with any of these. In no specific order. If I forgot any, it was not intentional.**

* r/AskDeaf
* r/hardofhearing
* r/ASL
* r/auslan
* r/BSL
* r/HearingAids
* r/Cochlearimplants
* r/disability
* r/Disability_Survey
* r/AskAudiology

**My personal thoughts and opinions on Reddit moderation in general.**

* It's time consuming. We are volunteers spread across multiple time zones to try to get the most coverage.
* We the moderators are humans and don't always agree exactly but trust each other to make a decision in good faith. We do have a group chat to discuss things that need to be escalated or evaluated further.
* We want to be consistent with rules and enforcement. Please don't feel slighted if we aren't always consistent. Please reach out to us. We have allowed removed posts and unbanned members after additional review.
* Reddit moderation tools suck and are not intuitive. It's easy to miss a message or forget to follow up. The automod will also take actions that we are not aware of unless we dig through the moderation log.
* The rules list doesn't match the moderation responses list. We need to fix this.
* I haven't had the time to learn how to program and tune the automod bot yet. It was configured years ago by people that are no longer active.
* The FAQ is really old and made by people that aren't active members anymore.

**Online chat.**

* There is a Discord server listed in the description. The Discord server is run by a completely different team and not officially affiliated with us. The invite link is here: [https://discord.gg/ae8T8pG](https://discord.gg/ae8T8pG)
* There is an official Reddit Community Chat for r/deaf. You can find it in the ""Community Chat Channels"" section of this subreddit. It's seldomly used but it was created by request from the community.

**Lastly, we need your help!**

* If you want to volunteer, please let us know. We need more moderators!
* What can we do to make this place better?
* Should we have regular online events?
* Should we have a designated day for self-promotions?
* Should we have a designated day for research/survey requests?
* Should we allow AMAs? I've only seen one request so far and I honestly didn't know if we should allow it or not.
* Should we allow posts from hearing people about dating advice? We get a lot, and they are well intentioned, but they can usually be answered in two ways. 1) Ask your partner what their preferred method of communication is. 2) Talk to your partner.
* Should there be a public moderation log? I've seen other communities do this and it's nice, but it requires a lot of effort on the moderators to do this.",8,1749761616.0,deaf,4,0.83,False

When I was young he would drink lambrini, around 5 years ago he lost his mum. He stayed heavily drinking spirits. He was drinking from morning to night and had really lost himself. We moved him out of his house and he made some real positive changes (around 3 years ago) he was no longer drinking spirits and had reduced his intake to half a bottle of wine a day. This was his hot girl summer. Over the coming years he increased his intake slowly and was drinking 3 bottles of wine a day. At the beginning of May he was rushed into hospital with coffee ground vomit and iscities (i have never seen someone's body look like that) he was being sick for 48 hours was giving antisickness and withdrawal meds. He was in hospital for 3 weeks he was increasing mobility food intake and liquids and honestly I thought he would be okay. The next day he start the sick again and became very confused. The doctor said his ammonia levels were very high and he had an infection. He passed away 6 days later. 

He was my hero, my biggest support and had so much love to give. My dad carried the weight of the world on his shoulders so we didn't have to. He raised 4 kids alone and we never went without. He was hard working, supportive and the ultimate girl dad.

I \*completely\* understand that my progress is slowed because of that.  But in my visit today they said something that I didn't quite understand.  I have a lower canine that is rotated 90 degrees and they were unable to place an attachment on it from the outset.  It's not really moving and as a result is opening up the tray a bit, reducing corrective pressure on my bottom teeth.  

The comment that was made was that 'due to lost time' they may need to do another refining scan and make another tray set.  Certainly possible, but to me this just seems like a problem with the technology rather than my slow progression through the sequence.  It doesn't matter one way or the other really but I'm just curious if there's a 'speed' aspect to the treatment that is compounding the problem with that tooth.",1,1749761533.0,Invisalign,1,1.0,False

I would like to preface this by saying I am a total Sheets/Excel noob, if this answer is fairly obvious please forgive me! 

As the title describes I am having trouble with having a selection from one drop-down cell correlate with an adjacent drop down list. Specifically, I would like to have one selection from the drop down trigger the selection from another drop down list in a different cell. The drop downs are two separate categories, the product and its various sizes and the legs that will be required to complete it. 

I tried doing an IF statement to achieve this but I think my formula is bunk cause I keep getting returned an error stating ""Invalid call to non-function"".

=IF(F2=""Small Coffee Table 13.25 H."")(G2=""11 7/8 in x 11 3/4 in H. (CT. Small)"") is what I attempted. 

I have attached screenshots of the two drop downs but what I'm looking for is for when I select ""Small Coffee Table 13.25 H."" in cell F2 it auto fills cell G2 with the correlated ""11 7/8 in x 11 3/4 in H. (CT. Small)"" etc. 

Any help or guidance would be so greatly appreciated! Thank you!

Promotions and raises were handed out like slices of pie at a family BBQ—but only if your last name matched the ones on the walls. Dissenters were swiftly fired, written up, or buried under bureaucratic nonsense.



Enter: Tommy 

Tommy, 27, a Florida transplant with a work ethic tighter than his budget, entered the office fresh-faced and hopeful. His first month? Quiet. Too quiet. But by month three, he noticed the cliques. Five employees who always took breaks together. Five who never seemed to be corrected, written up, or even busy. Five who, as he’d soon find out, were family.

Despite arriving 15 minutes early every day, helping coworkers, and trying his best, Tommy stumbled while learning a new process. He made five errors in two weeks—human mistakes, nothing malicious. But on the sixth, Supervisor Sandy pounced on him like a predator. She raised her voice in front of the office, with no professionalism or grace.

Tommy had had enough.

""Do not talk to me like that. Who do you think you are?"" he snapped.

Sandy’s face twisted in shock. She stormed off and within 24 hours, HR summoned Tommy. He was cited for “disruption,” issued a warning, and then publicly humiliated in emails that CC’d every manager. Errors he hadn’t even made were now being pinned on him. Tommy, already rattled, began emailing everything to his personal account for backup.

Then came a late arrival due to a car accident—his first. He emailed Sandy immediately upon arrival, only to be blasted at 4:45pm in another email—again, CC’ing all of management about time and attendance. No reply, no grace, just public shame.

While on a break smoking a stress cigarette, Tommy laughed at a ridiculous story on Reddit—until a fellow employee, Cherri, approached him. She pried into his work life. When Tommy vented and called Sandy “a bitch,” Cherri didn’t flinch. But when she ran back in and was soon spotted whispering with Sandy in the back hallway, Tommy's gut twisted. A setup.

The very next morning, HR requested a meeting. Tommy was informed of serious allegations: time theft, inappropriate language, and discrimination. He wasn’t told who reported him. He wasn’t even allowed to defend himself with witnesses. They told him a letter was coming in the mail with a hearing date.

Two days later, that letter came.

Tommy’s heart sank. The charges were exaggerated and maliciously false. Fear of unemployment settled in. But instead of folding, Tommy called his uncle, Eggplant Tracy—a nickname earned from his courtroom swagger and eggplant-sized ego. A seasoned attorney with a love for justice and black coffee.

“Send me everything,” Tracy said. “Emails. Notes. Your soul if you have to.”

Tommy did. Then he waited.

The Courtroom Showdown

Months passed. Tommy felt defeated. Then one morning, his phone rang.

“Hey kid… how ya holdin’ up?” Eggplant Tracy’s voice buzzed through the speaker.

“Barely breathing.”

Eggplant chuckled darkly. “Guess what?”

Scene fades to black.

Scene opens in court.

Tommy stands beside Eggplant Tracy. Across from them sits the entire corrupt management team, looking like children awaiting punishment after a food fight. HR reps looked like ghosts. Sandy tried to apologize with her eyes, but the judge only had eyes for justice.

The courtroom was packed. Reporters, former employees, and representatives from the Labor Department watched eagerly.

The Evidence:

Emails Tommy saved showing biased write-ups.

Time sheets proving he was early 99% of the time.

Testimonies from former employees, some crying on the stand.

Internal documents from whistleblowers proving nepotism in hiring.

Surveillance showing selective punishments and rewards.

Some of the stories were gut-wrenching:

One woman had lost her home after being fired for a ""bad attitude"" after asking for medical leave.

Another man’s child had died due to delayed care—he’d been passed over for a promotion that could’ve provided insurance coverage.

One person had been fired for “low performance” while receiving “Employee of the Month” awards.

Tommy’s final testimony was calm, honest, and powerful.

The Verdict:

The judge slammed the gavel.

“All five family members in management and three HR reps are charged with:**

Workplace nepotism

Hostile work environment

Wrongful termination

Retaliation

Falsifying employee records

Defamation

Obstruction of workplace investigations

Emotional distress damages

Each wrongfully terminated or passed-over employee was awarded $50,000 in damages.
Sandy cried. Marcus fainted. Trina tried to storm out and was stopped by court security. Uncle Lenny asked if he could “at least keep his mug.” Denied.

Three Weeks Later…

The office reopened under new management. All wronged employees were offered leadership roles. Many cried tears of joy when told.

At the welcoming ceremony, the new Director addressed them:

“Your dignity, strength, and honesty were tested. You didn’t fail. You exposed failure. Today, we rebuild this company… with you. Welcome to the Justice League.”

Epilogue:

Tommy looked out the Assistant Director’s window, a corner office with a view of the city park and lake. He sipped coffee slowly, watching women in sundresses stroll by. The sun kissed the glass softly.

“Life is good,” he whispered, kicking his feet up on the desk.

A voice came from the hallway: “Hey AD Tommy, there’s a meeting in five!”

He smiled, straightened his tie, and stood tall.

“Let’s give them something to believe in.”

Tommy was now the new Assistant Director!!

Tommy looked out the Assistant Director’s window, a corner office with a view of the city park and lake. He sipped coffee slowly, watching women in sundresses stroll by. The sun kissed the glass softly.

“Life is good,” he whispered, kicking his feet up on the desk.

A voice came from the hallway: “Hey AD Tommy, there’s a meeting in five!”

He smiled, straightened his tie, and stood tall.

“Let’s give them something to believe in.”

Tommy was now the new Assistant Director!!

About me, I'm a M24(Now) completed Masters in one of the reputed universities in USA.



Here comes the story.

When I  was planning to go to USA for masters after my engineering. I had 1.5 months spare time for my travel t USA.

I did not have a lot of interactions with girl, had one girlfriend when I was in 10th standard. After that almost 0 interactions not even friends. So, I decided to try Online Dating to see if I have the potential for any matches. I got lucky got 10-15 matches came my way. My plan was simple I was there only to make friends as I was having very little time. I still maintain good convo's with some of them. But there was this girl who used to study in Pune but family and settled in Hyderabad. We matched talkd for2 weeks. She was really cute and I liked her. Then I travelled and got in my university-got set. We used to still text daily almost 2 months. One day We decided to talk to on a call. I was nervous and it went well. Then we had have movie party(online) couple of times-it was fun. She likes movies, watches cricket, also loves dog and have a dog too. She was everything I wanted. Later she got a job and she was planning to move to Mumbai. She went on a vacation to Pondicherry. She called drunk dialed me. It was not romantic but we had long conversation about us how close we become it was not the first time-second time. She told me we should meet next time when I was in India. It was summer in 3 weeks. I booked the tickets to India. She was happy at first/excited too. But since when I landed the conversation were mostly initiated by me. It was planning for meeting. I don't know if she was really busy as she was moving to Mumbai for her Job or she was avoiding me. Probably after 1 month we met she planned at a coffee shop. Good Conversation-first time meeting her in person. It was really nice.

Then after I came back to USA, conversations were drying up and it was me who was text her unlike the past were she used to start conversations. I have/had feelings for her. I thought if it is going to be this way, I should put forward my feelings and see how she reacts. I felt if I keep getting attached to her it would get hard for me to get back from it. I expressed my feelings and yeah she left heart broken she said we could be friends but yeah after some days. We got ghosted.



**Present:** anytime I become depressed(like breakup)- Good things happen to me. I got a high paying internship just after that and it got converted into full time after my graduation, H1b on first attempt(but I intend to comeback to India) ",2,1749760941.0,hyderabad,1,1.0,False

- Listing featured coffee as a prime amenity, but there was barely enough coffee provided for two espressos. We went out that evening and bought more. 
- Listing said “essentials: towels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper” & “extra pillows and blankets” were provided, but there was only kitchen soap (no bathroom hand soap, shower soap, or shampoo/conditioner), only big bath towels (slightly stained, no washcloths, kitchen towel, or bath hand towels), and we stole extra pillows & blankets from the beds we weren’t using. We went out and bought a bar of shower soap. 
- Water was HOT. Like dangerously hot if you weren’t paying attention. 
- Shower drain was partially blocked, but didn’t overflow if we turned it on super low so we preferred that over having a handyman come in. 
- Clean-ish, though everything could really have done with a solid wipe down, particularly in the kitchen drawers. 
- No kitchen sponge for cleaning, so we went out and bought kitchen sponges.

So, leave honest review or ask for very small reimbursement? Am I being too literal in soap = all soaps, not just dish soap?

I don’t care how much money you make at 22 or what car you drive.

I don’t care about “high value man/woman” garbage or where you think someone should be by a certain age.

I hear this shallow competitiveness all over social media and even when I was at college and more recently at a coffee place, where people have started to measure themselves and others over nonsense — fashion, income, status, trying to involve me based off my jacket or watch, this affects real life.

I have autism and ASPD, and I just want to exist without being dragged into all this.

I’m not in your social group. I’m not interested. Why do people laugh at or mock others over things that don’t matter? Taking the bus, wearing thrift clothes (I personally do sometimes), or simply minding their business shouldn’t be cause for judgment.

Not everyone wants to play this game. Some of us were never even invited. Just stop trying to involve me.

It gets tuah point, I remember my dad saying how he enjoyed the solitude of prison because he was away from people, I think he valid for that.

TLDR: Stop dragging everyone into your shallow value system. Not everyone wants to play that game — and it’s none of your business where someone’s at in life. ",4,1749760770.0,Vent,3,0.75,False

After landing, we took the dirt road from the airport to the barn. For such a progressive country, they sure did have a lot of oil derricks on the side of the road. I thought it was odd, but once we got to the city we had to switch from the tractor we rode in on to the mules they rent out.

I have heard a lot about Tom Hortons. So I wanted to pop in. There I was served by the former prime minister. I was confused why he was in blackface, but I was trying to roll with it.

Disappointed but not discouraged, we trudged through the blizzard to the arena. It was hard to make out what people were saying because their accents were so nasally, but I think people were hurling anti-indigenous slurs at me. I have a bit of a tan and they have a bit of a problem with anti-Native racism (ask Jordin Tootoo) but for the most part they were too inebriated and incoherent for me to really get it.

Once I arrived at the barn, I was assaulted, defenestrated, and actually murdered. Yes, they literally killed me. My only crime was wearing a Luongo jersey. Apparently not winning a Stanley Cup for several decades leads to a lot of pent up aggression.

There was a guy wearing a Kane jersey. Before he started wailing on me, he said something about his wife. I tried to inform him that I wasn't his wife, but he said that is something his bitch wife would say before striking me several times more.

1l9x4uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarnivalCruiseFans/comments/1l9x4uk/just_off_of_the_miracle_out_of_dover/,Just off of the Miracle out of Dover,"Hi all. My dh and I sailed on Carnival Miracle out of Dover and I wanted to share our experience. 

Carnival Miracle, 8 nights. Cabin 8161

Ports of Call:

La Caruna, Spain

Porto, Portugal 

Lisbon, Portugal 

Bordeaux, France

Portland, UK

When we booked this cruise it was listed that we would sail out of Dover (London). Dover is a 11/2 train ride away from London. We booked our train tickets ahead of time. 

We flew into London Monday of last week and were able to tour the city for 4 days. London was amazing, but much cooler than we expected. I remember checking the temperature a few days prior and the high was 78.  If you go, pack your umbrella!

We stayed in a cute Airbnb Studio flat a block away from Hyde Park. We both absolutely loved the London. We purchased a 3 day Hop on/Hop off bus package that included a boat ride on the River Thames. 

Early Friday morning we headed to Paddington Station, where we road the tube to London Pancras Station. There we boarded a train for Dover. The weather was in the 60’s and rainy.  There were large buses available for transport to the port for a fee of 5$/pp. taxis were also available. We road the bus on the short ride to the port. 

First Day: usual fun activities on the Lido deck. The main pool area has a retractable glass roof, which came in handy!  Gary was our cruise director, and he was wonderful!

Day 2: Day at Sea. 

Day 3: La Caruna. Beautiful day and beautiful city. There are tours available for the cathedral 2 hours away. We strolled the city. There was a lighthouse with a huge Hercules statue. 

Day 4: Porto. There was a smaller town that we docked in Leixoes, a smaller city about 15 minutes from the town of Porto. We walked a few blocks and caught a bus taking us to Porto. The city is very hilly. Luckily the bus took us to the top of the city! We strolled the streets and decided to view the tower at Torre de Clerigos. 

The church itself was free, the tower was 10 euros pp. we opted to climb the tower. Keep in mind if you go it’s something like 12 stories, climbing up very narrow stairs. Up we went, I was breathing hard when we reached the top. Amazing views of both the city and the Douro river. 

After we toured the tower and church we rewarded ourselves with the best Gelato I’ve ever had. I wish I could tell you the name of the shop, it was a few steps away from the church. 

Day 5: Lisbon, Portugal. The Portuguese name for their capital city is Lisboa. We opted to tour the city with a Hop on/Hop off tour bus. The city was beautiful. Jacaranda trees were blooming their distinctive purple flowers. The city had lots of history and we learned a lot. 

Day 6: Day at Sea

Day 7: Bordeaux. Again it wasn’t really Bordeaux, which was a 2 hour bus ride. Instead we went to the local village of Soulec der Mur. A lovely little seaside village.  While there we enjoyed a glass of Bordeaux, because when in France. 

After our tasty libation, we walked to their small cathedral which was built in the 1200’s. It was small but beautiful. 

Day 8: Day at Sea

Day 9: Portland. This was an industrial port, with a castle and a military museum. We arrived early and it was quite chilly and rainy, probably low 50’s. We opted to get on a bus that took us to Weymouth. This was an incredible place, also a seaside village with a river that divides the town. This town was much bigger than the French port. 

About the Miracle: 

I am Platinum and I have been on many Carnival Ships. The layout was different than any of the other ships I have sailed on. The bridge was quite low on this ship. Also, the Promenade was on deck 2. There was one dining room that was on 2-3 aft. 

As I said the main pool had a retractable roof which came in handy
for much of our cruise. The Serenity area was on the aft side on the Lido deck. It held a small pool and a hot tub. We usually love Serenity as an adult only area of the ship. As a Floridian, I found it too cold to enjoy. The area was lovely, otherwise. 

Our cabin was an extended balcony room 8161, was almost in the middle of the ship. It was convenient to the Lido deck one floor up. Being under the Lido, I was concerned about noise. We didn’t notice anything excessive. The only slightly irritating thing was they did balcony cleaning twice and they were both on Sea Days. It seems with 5 ports of call it would have been better to schedule it then. It wasn’t a huge inconvenience, though. 

We celebrated an anniversary on this cruise and Gary sent us some chocolate covered strawberries. One day we enjoyed a lovely tea. We had coffee. 

The entertainment was good, food was okay. I had a Plain Jane at Guys and it didn’t taste like what I remembered. It almost had a sweet taste. We ate almost exclusively in the Bacchus Dining Room, only dining in the Lido buffet a few port days. 

As it was a longer European cruise the other sailors skewed middle aged and above. There were very few kids on board and they were well behaved. 

All in all, we had a marvelous experience. This was my first time visiting Europe, something I have dreamed about my whole life. For reference, I am 61 and spouse is 69. We are active which came in handy a few times. We enjoyed each and every stop on our cruise, but London was my favorite.

I Wish I Didn't Know That (Part 4),"I know it has been some time since the last update, but things have transpired rather superfluously. I had hoped this deal I made, the longer I took to write down these experiences, the longer I stretched them out…. I had hoped it would grant me some time, but this has cost me. Cynthia has now been roped into this, and so has Rose. 

I tried to fight, move my muscles, go against the ebb and flow of the macabre, gooey dark molasses that has been stripping away my being only to lose a few more layers of my psyche to expose the already rotting insides that I always knew had existed long before I had been a part of any of this. 

… Let's start this one differently; let me give it another shot. After all, these are supposed to be cathartic entries for me and entertaining for you. 

Setu's rendition of the symbol had me scouring the web like a maniac for at least two days, and what I found didn't instill confidence either. The most I could gather was that it was the symbol of a fallen God, a forgotten God barely mentioned in the dark corners of forums, belonging to threads I posted that would either get archived or deleted within hours. But for those few hours, while the thread was up, I would get comments that would tell me —

*Looks bad*

*Nice try Edgelord*

*What, are we letting anyone post random things now?*

*That's sacrilege, you know how offensive that is? Istg, people will twist and turn holy symbols just to get a reaction. You want me to turn the cross sideways and then turn it into a crude Swastika?*

*The last we entertained such a thread, it turned out to be a 13-year-old who had just found his dad's old Victorian horror stories*.

But then, one comment offered me hope.

*Idk dude but if you're serious about this, everything looks wrong, it looks upside down, looks mirrored, the serpent encircling it is moving in the opposite direction….This doesn't represent eternity…it represents eternal torment…and the symbol…Idk who it is…but whoever it is, has either fallen, is doomed, or once betrayed wherever it came from*

\- 

I remember the first two comments because they would always show up, I remember the third one clearly because that's what told me that this was symbolic and holy to someone at the least. The fourth one I remember because it had sent me down a rabbit hole of someone who was suffering the same fate as me a few months ago, albeit fictionally. The kid had ended the 6-month long thread with a photo of the monster that stalked him at night…the link to the photo Rick Rolled everyone invested. 

I still chuckle about it as I write this…the last one…the last one stuck with me, sticks with me because I would soon come to find out that some random stranger on the internet had tried to warn me of what I was getting into, but every protest against my desire to visit the island, every obstacle, every statistical or logistical problem only brought out the worst in me. 

I had ignored this comment thinking that someone was simply trolling me, trying to scare me even more than I was. I had also decided to lie to Setu, falsely promising his identity would be protected. Because after the interviews, after the symbol, after its potential meaning being unveiled, the pit in my stomach had grown to a gargantuan size. It had swallowed my morals, had twisted my intents and had put out a shoddy copy of my identity that I stupidly took as my own. I know people often say that if they could go back in time, they would stop their former selves….they would stop themselves before it was too late ….I wouldn't. I wouldn't dare even try…

I had lied to Setu, I had lied to Bala that the terms had changed after Carl and the rest had seen the footage, I had lied to Carl that there was even going to be a documentary to show in the first place…and I had lied to Mr. Sastry by handing over $15,000 and promising the rest once I had wrapped up the project. Faking a contract was easy; averting his gaze as his adopted son fell deeper into the web of my lies was even easier… 

I had become this vile chameleon that would instantly adapt to scenarios to get what it wanted. Back then, I had thought of myself as a hero …a hero saving Setu, a hero helping him find his origins, a hero doing what the world should've done long ago… a visionary on the frontier of the unexplored… but now I know, I was a fool barking and gnawing at the trust of my people and dragging them to the edge of the world and into the maw of something that would one day eventually change the meaning of ….creation. 

And so, assuming that nobody would understand me, nobody would understand my burden, I began to sow seeds of mistrust and curiosity that would eventually lead me where I had always wanted to go. Setu was, by all means, a stalwart man, but I had also gained his trust; I had become a confidant he never knew he needed. Years ago, he had tried to learn more about his past but was always shut down by his parents; he had always tried to look more into it, but they had always averted his curiosity. But now, as an outsider, I could exploit that, and before you knew it, he was itching to learn more about his past, just like I had planned. 

Bala however, was another story, he had grown to resent me, our friendly banter had ended the day the ""documentary"" was approved and funded. I had paid him in full, and maybe he found that disrespectful, but in hindsight, he was probably onto me. Bala had stuck around for a week as I prodded Setu and the Sastry family for minute details. But then out of the blue, he had come to my room one morning and had quit. 

""I need a change of pace, I need a taste of normality, I am going back to Chennai""

""Sure… Wait… is something wrong? I know we haven't exactly been talking lately but you know I think of you as a friend Bala….right?""

I still remember him staring into my eyes then… If I was me, I would've known what that stare meant, but I wasn't and so I didn't. 

""Goodbye Phillip. Maybe we'll see each other again soon…""

I nodded, handed Bala some extra cash, and watched him drive away. By then I had learned my way around the culture better, I had bought myself a used car, had learned how to deal with swindlers, and most importantly, had found my preference when it came to food. And then one fateful night, while I was exhaling clouds of cancer, lost in the thoughts of how to take my machinations a step further, there was a knock on my room's door… It was Setu. I had welcomed him in, and when Setu spoke… I knew the seeds I had planted had finally sprouted…

""Do you really think there are more out there Phillip?""

""I don't know man… you're a miracle to be honest, finding another miracle in this lifetime seems like a heavy dose of optimism even for me…""

""I am starting to believe that you might be right…""

Part of me wanted to jump and probe Setu further, but by then I had become this evil chef of spiced lies and so I waited with bated breath as I let Setu cook… He took his sweet time, but eventually continued much to my sadistic pleasure…

""I …remember what I told you what I thought about my parents?""

I nodded and sighed, playing my part of a trusted confidant and friend to perfection. Setu always had strong feelings about his biological parents. He didn't hate them, but to him, there was an unknown fear and trepidation associated with them. He had hinted at this when I had initially started to peel his layers, but over the past two weeks, he had revealed how he truly felt. As far as I had gathered, Setu had repressed memories and buried feelings. Whenever he thought about them, he felt fear, dread, he got uneasy and twitchy but as I would come to know through this conversation, he had finally managed to peel away a layer that I had failed to pierce despite my desperation. 

""I wonder if she would recognize me… I wonder if he would…would they regret or rejoice if they ever knew that I was still alive? They'd probably shun me though…considering how protective the tribe is when it comes to interactions with the mainland""

I simply nodded and continued my stoic impersonation of someone actively listening to a friend. In reality, I was struggling to ignore the itch under my skin to push Setu towards my ultimate goal. 

""Do you remember them? Their faces, the island, anything?""

He shook his head, ""No… no, just my gut screaming at me, my mind searching for memories that should be there but aren't…""

I knew I had to stall this, and so I allowed silence to sink its teeth into our conversation and after a minute or so, Setu spoke up

""So… if there are no more survivors, no one to interview… how are you going to make the documentary…""

""I mean your interview and existence alone might be enough…"" I sighed pretending and acting like I had been defeated…

""But you can't be sure that it will prove to be worth it right?""

""No, …Maybe… but certainly not after I've paid you in full… I'd be swimming in debt by then…""

I put on a brave face while hoping my chest would endure the loud thumps, the huge hits my ribs were taking from my heart with each beat, knowing too well that the moment was coming…

""Ever thought about going to the island?""

""No…hah that'd be crazy and illegal. Why? Are you thinking of going back?""

Setu looked out of the window and into the distance, his eyes desperately trying to find an Island that I now know was stuck in his head, just like it was stuck in mine…

""I tried denying myself that freedom, but a part of me feels like its my right to go back if that's where I belong. Find out what happened back then, why did my family lose me…are they still alive?""

""I.. understand…""

I wanted to say so much more but that would've blown it. It took all my strength to hold myself back until Setu proposed the idea himself, which was crucial. 

""Do you think we can make it there? I mean it would be pretty sweet… you'll get footage and information that could complete your documentary….""

""Yeah…yeah it would be nice… but you're better off dreaming, getting there would be a nightmare and getting past your parents, your father especially… would be hell…""

Again, after a long pause…

""What if I was able to convince them? What if somehow they weren't part of this equation… Could you make it happen?""

""Wait… you're actually serious about this? SETU IF we get caught we'd be sent to prison for god knows how long! And I am not risking that or your life especially after knowing what your parents fear ever since I showed up to interview you…""

""You sound like them…but this is my life… my past. I have a right to know…""

*Silence*

""You should think this over man… give it a good week or so at least""

""I have… I have been thinking about this ever since you told me that I could be from the island… Can you do it? Do you think you can pull this off?"" 

I sighed, and acted my part and after some deliberate performance of contemplating my options, I said…

""Let me look into it""

Setu nodded, we shook hands, and he then left my room. I'll confess I spied on him from my window and after he had passed the hotel gate, I screamed at the top of my lungs. It was done, and my dream was coming true. All I had to do was pretend and waste a few days, preferably a week in the name of research. In actuality, all of that was already done. My key and safe passage to the island was through a man named Abbas. 

Now, before I tell you about Abbas, let me confess something: I had assumed that my manipulation was what had pushed Setu to go back to the island, but in reality, the reason was something that he would confess on our way to the island. A confession I still hope he had made that night, or even before we left, because the dream Setu had, which prompted him to take this step, was a warning in disguise, a warning that he misinterpreted as a calling. 

Now, about Abbas, Carl and I had met the guy at a late-night party in Pondicherry, he dealt with rather illicit and provocative substances, and so I had naturally exchanged numbers with him in case I was back in India and wanted to experience the high life again. I had contacted him a few days ago, and under the guise of getting to know him better, I had learned that his people smuggled in various substances from Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines through illegal sea routes. And so I was supposed to meet him in Chennai a few days later. Coincidentally, the doctor who treated Setu was also in the same city. Abbas had helped me track him down, which gave me hope that he would be able to help me reach the island. 

However, upon reaching Chennai, things weren't off to a great start. Dr. Kumar wasn't exactly cooperative, and that was because I hadn't told Mr. Sastry that I had tracked him down. The man didn't know I was in contact with the family, and I didn't want the Sastrys to know that I was stalking their son's old doctor. Eventually, I was forced to show him their interviews, and it was then that he decided to calm down and meet with me officially at his home. When I reached there the next day, I was greeted by a quaint two-story house that was a rather pleasant contrast to the bustling life in the heart of the city. Dr. Sai Kumar was already waiting for me in the yard. 

He had two chairs set up for both of us, and when I took a seat, he promptly ordered tea for us. Though this setup appeared welcoming, this was clearly his way of testing me, making sure I didn't get to interact with his family, and ordering tea for me without knowing my preference seemed like another power move. I liked that everyone in the South of India preferred coffee, and so I had grown used to it being the staple drink, but now, here I was on a hot and humid Chennai mornin,g surrounded under the shade of palm trees, having some hot tea. I didn't want to start the conversation on a bad note, and thus I begrudgingly sipped the tea and said…

""Thanks for meeting me Mr. Kumar… you have a lovely place""

He simply nodded, clearly wanting to get over the pleasantries as soon as possible…

""Thanks Phillip. Let's get one thing straight before we talk… I don't want to be on tape, I don't want to be a part of your documentary because frankly talking about my patients without their consent, is breaking the law and my oath..""

""I know Doctor, and that can be fixed""

I took out my phone, dialed Setu and handed it over to the Doctor. His face was like an ocean of expression, each consecutive wave bringing along a new one, it started with curious, then familiarity and happiness upon talking to Setu which was then followed by confusion when I assume Setu granted him permission to talk about his medical history, and then eventually defeat when he realized that he would now have to talk to me. Of course the entire conversation was in the native language so I didn't know what they talked about, but when Doctor Kumar handed the phone back to me, he said…

""Fine Philip. You seem to know your way, and Setu seems to trust you. What do you want to know?""

""Everything, but before we start, do I have permission to record your audio? You don't have to be on camera if you don't want but your audio will be of tremendous help.""

He nodded, ordered his servant to get him some documents and then started. I quickly pressed the record button on my audio recorder and placed it between us. 

""Setu's case was unique but not untreatable. Yes, he was malnourished, dehydrated, sunburnt but nothing that was untreatable. That is until the wound on his back began to act up…""

By this time his servant had brought him the necessary files and after flipping through a few pages, he handed me two photographs. It was the wound on Setu's back and it was gnarly. There was a huge gash between his shoulder blades and the skin around it was purple and black. There were tiny holes, missing flesh, as though cookie cutter fishes had had a field day while he was in water. The tea almost jumped from my stomach back into the cup but I managed to control my reflexes. The wound was horrid, and imagining that on the back of someone who was only 7 or 8 years old still gives me nightmares. But this was only the beginning…

""Yeah…and these photos were taken 5 days after Setu was recovered. I had him on IV from the first day and even attempted a debridement surgery in the confines of the home. We were able to remove the highly affected tissue but there was no positive response from his body. The wound culture didn’t raise any alarms but this made Setu’s case all the more puzzling from a medical perspective. I was administering every antibiotic ideal for his condition considering his weight and the results of the culture, yet it seemed to have no effect. The fever would suppress with every dose but the would showed no signs of healing. ”

He then pointed to the photos,

“These holes you see, we assumed this was done by sea life at first, but then…look at this…""

Dr. Kumar handed me another paper, this time an MRI. I didn't know what I was looking at, and so Dr. Kumar explained it to me and once I realized what he was trying to say, chills ran down my spine. The holes led all the way to Setu's spine…

""Now we tried stitching them up the first day he was brought in. The stitches held for a day, but then dissolved all on their own after 24 hours. Reluctantly and after consultation with some of my other colleagues in Chennai, we decided to use Staples…but 24 hours later, the skin had lesioned and separated on its own…the tissue seemed to be rejecting treatment""

""So….. you're telling me that somehow, the holes were forced open?""

Dr. Kumar didn't want to answer that question and his following words made that clear. 

""You see the holes weren't that big, only 2 to 3 cm in diameter, but the bigger wound, that was my biggest concern. At first I thought sepsis had begun its course, but then that MRI showed something else, a foreign mass.""

He then pointed to a very dark area that at first seemed to be a part of the surrounding back muscles around the spine.

""Unfortunately for Setu, I spotted that anomaly after 3 weeks. During those three weeks, we tried everything, from simple bandages to speculation of skin grafts. Despite Mr. Sastry's unwavering stance on not involving any other doctor, I consulted with many and even brought my daughter with me to observe Setu behind his back. She was in the last year of her medical college and she was the one who spotted the anomaly when I showed her the MRI scan.""

""What was it, Doctor?""

""As I said, a foreign organic mass. It seemed to resemble the muscle tissue from which it was extracted at first, but once separated, we preserved the sample in formalin, but within hours, its cellular structure collapsed. By the time I had finished  patching up Setu after the procedure, the mass had lost its original structure, and by the time I was able to analyze it hours later at the hospital, I realized it had suffered from acute cellular degradation.""

""Did you do any other tests?""

""There wasn't much to learn after that happened. We debated sending it for advanced testing, but Mr. Sastry was adamant. Any formal lab would generate records that could expose Setu. ""

""So that was it then…""

He nods. ""After that, the boy recovered miraculously; the stitches held their ground, With the mass removed, systemic antibiotics and wound management finally began to show rapid improvement. Setu was saved from the verge of sepsis. He was kept on nutritional fluids and Vitamins for a few months but that's the extent of that. 

""Did his parents ever take him to a psychologist?""

Dr. Kumar gave me a cold hard stare after that one. I knew he knew something but his words implied otherwise…

""Not that I know of Philip no""

To avoid overstaying my welcome, I made copies of the photos and the MRI scan and left his residence. Dr. Kumar had given me more than enough information needed but right now I needed to focus on my meeting with Abbas, and how I was going to help me arrange my excursion to North Sentinel Island. 

— 

I am exhausted after that one, having confessed what I have and facing what I've done and how it started has taken its toll on me. As I mentioned at the start, I can't use this to prolong my control either. Not after experiencing the consequences firsthand… as for the image Setu had drawn, I couldn't find it, but I have attached my own rendition of it below. I have tried to be accurate rather than artistic, neither of us were artists to begin with…

You can refer to the post linked above to see where my health was eight months ago, when I first shared my hba1c.

Last Friday, I had new blood work done. I now weigh 100–101 pounds. My cholesterol is down and normal, including LDL and HDL, is all in the healthy range. My HbA1c has dropped to **5.4**. Everything came back healthy—except for a vitamin D deficiency.

I want to briefly share what I’ve been doing. For the first 3-4 months following the elevated hba1c results, I’ve cut out all junk food and processed foods. Completely. Most of my meals are home-cooked and clean—no unnecessary condiments, no hidden sugars. This part is non-negotiable. No “just a bite” of dessert, no occasional chips or cookies. None. They add up, and they matter. Even if people around you say, “ohhh come on\~ it’s just one bite”. DONT give in. tell them to shut up.

Here’s what my typical weekday looks like:

**Morning:**  
Boiled egg whites, black coffee, an hour at the barre studio, followed by a 1–2 hour walk or bike ride.  
***EDIT:*** *I forgot to mention I also take protein powders. I like Isopure unflavored protein powder. Just one scoop in the morning with 2-3cups of water. Speaking of water, stay hydrated throughout the day. So important.*

**Lunch:**  
Celery (or other veggies) with avocado, with either chicken or salmon, light salt pepper seasoning with garlic and onion, and a large bowl of leafy greens. No dressing unless its home-made and i know exactly what goes in it. If I want something sweet, I only have a small amount, and only **after** a full, balanced meal—which usually keeps cravings away.

**Snack/Dinner:** I snack on mixed nuts. If I’m still hungry, I’ll have some Greek yogurt with seeds. Nothing else. No syrup, no sweeteners. So, this pretty much fills me up. And in the evening i usually take a 20-minute walk.

***EDIT:*** *the above will put me at around 1,600-1,800 calories a day.*

**Weekends:**  
Rest days. I do allow myself cheat ***snacks***—not cheat ***days***. just SNACKS. One or two throughout that weekend and only **AFTER** a balanced meal. Then as for exercise, I stick to light walking and stretching on the weekends.

This routine helped me bring all my numbers into a healthy range. While 5.8 HbA1c wasn’t dangerously high to begin with, it had been steadily climbing and I decided to make a drastic change in my lifestyle. If I didn't, it would only just go up.

I hope sharing this gives others some encouragement. Small choices, done consistently, really do add up. And be kind to yourselves.

This was not easy by any means. But I chose to ""suffer"" now so I wouldn’t have to ""suffer"" longer later. It’s hard. It takes discipline and time. but it’s doable, and it’s absolutely possible. (goes without saying that of course, if there are underlying health issues or a family history, can certainly make this much more difficult)",3,1749760036.0,prediabetes,1,1.0,False

People complained a lot about the ending of MHA. I think the ending is great, and a lot of complaints are mostly idiots who don’t get the story or simply didn’t read it. However, I do think there are some valid complaints - such as the lack of introspection on Deku’s part, which seemed very lacking towards the final act of the series. I wrote this scene so that we can get good closure on Deku’s thoughts about everything that transpired through the final battle, and set up his future inspiration as a teacher.

**IZUKU**  
No. From being *me*.

No matter how much you initially love something, it's NEVER enough to carry you through.

At first, it feels like biking downhill. Easy, fast, kind of thrilling. Then somewhere in the middle, the road tilts uphill, your legs start burning, and you start asking, ""Why the hell did I start this?""

We need **discipline** to accomplish anything meaningful and valuable!

Learning your 5000th word in a foreign language is never going to feel as exciting as your first (And it’s not supposed to). However, that’s the line between mastery and almost wasting time.

If discipline matters this much in our solo life, it matters **10 times more** when it comes to our relationships.

# My personal experience

I’ve had “good” Dommes before. The catch? That ""good"" lasted anywhere from *a few hours* to *a few weeks*.

The pattern was always the same:  
*Day one: electric.*  
*Day two: a bit colder.*  
*Day three: Taking me completely for granted and starting to forget I exist.*  
*Eventually, I started to feel like my presence was some kind of inconvenience to them, so I moved on.*

And no, I didn’t take it personally. It wasn’t about me. And I don’t even think it was about them being fake or bad people either. It usually came down to two things:

1. They didn’t have the **capacity** to be consistent.
2. Or they didn’t **care** enough to try.

**A Domme who doesn’t have her own life in order will bring nothing but chaos into yours.**

A good example of consistency is my current Domme. It wasn’t until I met her that I realized long-term dynamics are actually possible. There are a lot of things I appreciate about her, but the one that tops everything is her **consistency**.

And maybe it’s not a coincidence. She has a military background, and that mindset shows. She doesn’t flake. She doesn’t shift with her mood. She shows up:

* She can be happy, bored, excited, stressed, or tired, but she never lets that bleed into our dynamic. No matter what, I always feel the same warmth, kindness, and presence.
* I could send her a couple of hundred dollars, a coffee, or nothing for a week or so. Doesn’t matter. She treats me the same.
* She could be at the gym, a party, working, hanging with friends, or just chilling at home. She still finds a way to check in and connect with me.

The other night, she was exhausted from work and went to bed early. But she *didn't put her phone on silent,* because she wanted to hear it when I said good night to her.  
That hit different. Not gonna lie, it almost brought a tear to my eye.

This kind of consistency gives me something invaluable: **stability**.  
It makes me feel emotionally **safe**. Grounded. Centered.  
Like I can **count on her**, truly **rely on her**, no matter what.

And in the current findom scene, full of flakes, ghosters, mood-swingers, and people who change overnight... That’s **EXTREMELY RARE**.

# Consistency is a Two-Way Street 🚦

We’ve made enough jokes about fake Dommes who call themselves dominant after watching one TikTok (Just kidding, it's never enough and never gets old 🤭). But seriously, time to turn the mirror toward ourselves.

Are we really submissive?  
Do we practice submission like a skill?  
Do we try to grow and gain experience as a sub?

Because if we only follow instructions when we *feel* like it, or only obey when we’re horny, and then disappear the moment post-nut clarity hits... are we ""real subs""?

Being a sub also means showing up, day after day.  
Even when it's not as exciting as day one. Even when you're tired.  
Especially when you're not in the mood.

We can’t expect consistency from our Dommes if we don’t offer the same back!

Even outside any dynamic, **consistency is the second most admirable quality a human being can have.** It’s what builds trust, reputation, and relationships. Slowly, quietly, but permanently.",13,1749759520.0,paypigsupportgroup,4,0.93,False

I'm (24M) at an interesting crossroad with my SO (24F). We were introduced through a mutual friend, and have been together for about 8 months. Things have moved quickly and we moved in together after only dating for 3 months. Long story short, she got a job in my city, my lease was turning over, and we were both looking at 1BR apartments. We each wanted a nice place, and she was the one who said, ""screw it, do you want to be my roommate?"" We both jumped on the idea and the rest is history.

We have so much in common, similar values, and both active people. We spent the holiday's with each other's families, and I'm so happy to have her in my life. Our relationship is a story for a different day and I thought it might give a little helpful insight. Now, let me get into the ""meat and potatoes"" of this post.

Her dog is my **only** hesitation in our relationship. The dog is a Portuguese Water Dog mixed with a Mini-Poodle and about 20lbs. The breed is high-energy and not the best for apartment living. She got it during her senior year of college- which doesn't seem like to best decision. I love my girlfriend, but can't convince myself I love her dog.

It is **hyper reactive**, doesn't do well with new people (barking, growling, and eraddic) or in public spaces, and it limits our ability to be away from the apartment for more than 8 hours. It also eats plants, underwear, and anything left on the couch/coffee tabe. It has severe **separation anxiety.** It is 18 months old (basically a puppy) and it is a very sweet dog once it settles down. My girlfriend paid $4500 to have the dog professionally trained, and even the trainer said Billie (the dog) is a ""unique case"" and they hadn't experienced a dog with such high levels of reactivity/anxiety. The dog has an E-Collar, which is a little inhumane in my opinion and I hate shocking it (at low levels), but it's the only way she listens and my girlfriend encourages the use of the E-Collar. My girlfriend loves Billie- as any good dog owner should- and getting rid of it will never be in the question. There are times where my girlfriend and I are both frustrated, and we work together to take care of it.

My girlfriend and her dog are a package deal and it makes me anxious to take it anywhere because it causes a scene. We've been to farmers markets, dog parks (and regular parks), the beach, and anywhere in public. It is scared of absolutely everything I can't imagine a world where I am 35-40 years old and this dog is still in my life. I know my girlfriend and I have only been together for 8 months, but we both see each other having a future together. I've gotten to the point where I've grown spiteful of Billie.

I've grown up with pets all my life (large breed dogs, cats, fish, frogs) and I love animals in general. However, I can't bring myself to love Billie. My girlfriend has no idea about my feelings about her dog and I have bit my tongue for so long. I'm very nice to the dog, I scratch it's tummy, take it for long walks, and throw the ball for it, but I will never love this animal in the same way I did any of my family pets growing up. Another thing, I love to travel and spend time with friends/family (away from the apartment), but there's a constant commitment to make it back to our apartment to provide care.

Does anyone have any suggestions/advice for the way I move forward with this situation? Or, has anyone experienced anything similar?

1l9wohk,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1l9wohk/how_do_i_talk_to_my_parents_about_my_10yearold/,How do I talk to my parents about my 10-year-old brother needing more emotional support?,"Hi all,

I’m(26F) looking for advice on how to talk to my parents about my little brother, K (10M). I’m really worried he needs more emotional support than he’s getting, and I don’t know how to bring it up without them getting defensive or shutting me down.

K lives in Florida with my dad(48M),  stepmom(38F), and sister, C(4F). Back in April, his pediatrician mentioned he may have Retinitis Pigmentosa, a condition that can lead to vision loss. He’s getting official testing and a diagnosis at the end of June. There have been signs before this — like struggling to find objects that are right in front of him (e.g., not seeing a soda in the fridge).

K also has a hormone disorder and is receiving hormone injections to go through puberty. From what I understand, that medication may also increase his appetite, which is good because he barely eats anything besides McDonald’s or sandwiches.

When I spoke to my stepmom recently, she said they’re planning to teach K braille, how to use a cane, and maybe even get him a seeing-eye dog — which I fully support. Learning those skills early while he still has some vision is really important.

But here’s the issue: My dad recently told me K has become a “huge germaphobe.” He said K wants to take three showers a day, washes his hands so much they turn red, and wants his sheets changed multiple times daily. My dad is also a germaphobe and was recently diagnosed with Illness Anxiety Disorder — to the point where he’s had panic attacks thinking he’s having a heart attack. He constantly talks about germs and health concerns, so I gently pointed out that K may be modeling his behavior. My dad disagreed and just said K needs therapy (which I agree with too).

They also have a 4-year-old daughter, C, who cries when her hands get dirty or if there are little spots on her clothes. It makes me think both kids are absorbing a lot of stress and anxiety from the household.

I want to be clear — I’m not a doctor or a therapist. This is just what I’ve gathered from reading, speaking with my own therapist, and observing. But I really feel that the way my parents are reacting to K’s possible blindness and health issues might be adding stress instead of helping. It seems like K is trying to control something — like cleaning himself — because he feels overwhelmed or scared. And I don’t hear much about them comforting him emotionally.

Their overall parenting style concerns me. They don’t offer a lot of emotional support — they tend to yell or order the kids around. When the kids push back, they either give in or snap. There’s no real consistency or emotional reassurance. When they were living here last year in Arizona, it was a lot of TV, unlimited snacks (even coffee), and minimal structure.

I practice gentle parenting with my own 3-year-old, so the contrast is pretty big. I’ve tried saying things like, “He probably just needs you guys to really be there for him emotionally. Let him know this is scary, but you’re there for him no matter what.” I’m not sure how that was received. My dad tends to shut me down by saying things like, “I still see you as 14,” even though I’m an adult with two kids myself now.

I’m not trying to change them — I know I can’t. I just want them to understand that emotional support is just as important as physical care. K is going through something really heavy for a child his age, and I don’t want him to feel alone or misunderstood.

So here’s my ask: How can I talk to them in a way they’ll actually hear? Should I keep trying or let it go? Is there a way to offer help without sounding like I’m judging them?

Any advice is appreciated. I just love my little brother and want the best for him. 💛",1,1749759326.0,family,1,1.0,False

Where I come from, today is valentine's day, while my friends make posts about being single or in love I just feel broken, I've never spent any valentines day dating so it never bothered me before, but today I've been failing to cope due to the recent loss of my father, I've no one to talk to about my feelings and what I feel, and I'm unemployed at the moment so I can't pay for therapy so I'll lay it all down here and try to feel better even for a bit. So I want to talk about me and my father just for a little bit.

My father and me don't looked much a like, appearence and personality wise, I'm mixed, son of a black man and a white woman and I'm much more alike my mother, my dad was short and strong, I'm more taller than he was (yet I'm not considered tall enough for most people including me lol) and I'm not as strong as he wanted me to be, even frail to some extent. My father was easygoing and extroverted, all parties and events he was always there being the one who made everyone laugh and being his iconic self, meanwhile I'm not like that at all, I've tried so much to be like him, but in the end I couldn't change who I am. When I was still a kid and my parents went to somewhere and took me with them, I always got compared to him, not in a mean way, people here in my country are usually just like my father so seeing a kid in the corner of the place with his cellphone and headphones was a little weird I guess, back in the day I didn't care about it, now I think if I should've pushed me further to be like him, this way we could have spent more time together.

My childhood and early adolescence with my dad are cheerished memories for me, when my father took me to fish for the first time, or when he bought me a PS2 and started to encourage me to learn english just to translate things and musics for him, or when I graduated middle school and his smile was open wide the entire event, or when he watched me play football and win second place with my team, and even more recently he was encouraging me to learn japanese as well because he knew a bit from his friends and from past jobs that he did with japaneses.

My father always told me how he never had a childhood because of how he had to start to work at 11 years old to help at home, he always worked after that, until his lasts days on earth, my mother even joked with him that he was an eternal child for enjoying watching movies for kids or kids shows, he never denied and he trully loved watching it all. 

When I was 16 I made the worst decision of my life and ended up dating a extremely manipulative and toxic girl who was older than me, she completely destroyed my self confidence and isolated me from friends, in the end the only thing she lefted me with were addictions and a extremely severe depression, I tried to end it all many times than I can count, I almost failed my last year of high school because I couldn't focus on classes and just slept, or just skipped school to lay and cry on my bed, that made me lose 2018 and 2019 completely, not once my father pressured me to anything, we didn't talked much at this point, I'm the type of person who bottle it up until i can't anymore and my dad wasn't the best at talking feelings out. 

My dad was not perfect, no one is, but he tried his best and I can see it now, he tried to taught me how to drive but I never had the interest in cars or motorcycles, when I got older he stopped to take me with him to fishing tripps and went with his friends, back in the time that hurted me but eventually I got over it, he never did it out of malice, he worked all week, just having monday as a free day, waking up at 3AM every single day just to come back home around 5PM, I can see him wanting to spend some time with someone else who could've interacted more with him than me being quiet most of the time. Last year he bought me a plain cake for my birthday, I didn't reacted as he expected, not because I felt entitled to anything, but that made me sad, my mother gave him an earful and he bought a slice of a cake that i actually like. I understand that he probably just didn't thought the same as me or my mom, because that's how he was raised, i never heard my dad complain once about anything at all (besides when he was watching football on the TV lol), not even when he got mocked at work because of how he smelt or when at this same job they accused him of stealing, this in particular was hard for me to watch, my father always wanted to smell nice and always took ""perfume baths"" as my mother called, from how much he used it.

In 2020 I enlisted in the army and joined them, if you ask me why I did it I can give many answers, because my ex told me I would never do anything significant in life and just rot and die, because no one in my family ever enlisted and joined before (my father's family was always hyper competitive so this was a reason to prove myself I guess), because I wanted to kick depression and take my life on my own hands, all of those are true, but to make my father proud was one of those reasons, I didn't went to my graduation in high school so at least i got some pictures with him when I enlisted and joined, and probably that was one of the last pictures of us together. In september of this same year my grandma (my father's mom) passed away, I was not close to her because she had Alzheimer and didn't even remembered me, I could get out of service when the news reached me and i went to the cemitery, I always had some issues with my father's family because of how competitive they always were, so being there with uniform, in my mind was somewhat of a proof that the undermined boy they always dismissed was somewhere above their expectatives now, but all my competitive side died out in the moment I saw my father crying, that was the first time in my life i've ever saw him cry, that made me feel horrible and all those feelings I had, all those thoughts my ex planted in my mind came all running back inside my head, after one week bottling everything up, I had a complete breakdown in the middle of my service and got relieved from any military duties, this made me feel completely useless and a fraud, all I did for the rest of the year was going to the army's psychologist and psychiatrist where besides my depression i got diagnosed with impostor syndrome as well.

In the end I got discharged and lost 2021, 2022 and half of 2023 because of this, I had no will to live or to do anything at all, and the meds just made me feel physically ill, one day I was drinking in the roof of my house past midnight, feeling completely like shit not even smoking was helping me to relax anymore, so I thought about ending it all again, and so I just fell from there, by some insane miracle I didn't got hurt at all, just got some scratches and bruises, my father woke up with the sounds and when he looked at me all I could do was cry and beg him for forgiveness, for being useless and not making him proud, he never answered me, he took me inside and helped me bathe and gave me water and coffee, some days later I got a chance of enlisting in a nurse assistent course and I did, because I had to try again, or else I would be burden forever.

And I did it, I finished the course, but this year, in january he passed away, he said to me that he almost feel from from his bicycle and started to feel pain in his legs, even with pain he went to work for two more days until it became unbearable, I called an ambulance and went with him to the ER, they just medicated him and sent him home, I should've known that wasn't so simple as that, but yet I did nothing, because I couldn't think about anything at all, in the next day my mother went with him to the ER again, he stayed there until I could get home and go there, to be with them, I talked with the nurse that i got to know when I did my internship there and got some help to transfer my dad to a hospital, I got there with him 9PM, I did all I could, talked with doctors, nurses and relayed every information I had, the last thing my dad said to me was ""I'm cold"" I covered him with the sheet before they said to me wait outside, at 1AM they transferred him to the ICU, he had cateters in his arms and neck, he was already sedated, then there I was, alone in that corridor. I didn't know back then but that was the last time I would see him still alive, as a nurse assistent I had faith that he would survive, even if I weren't able to help at all, but it was not enough, I should have thought more or see the signs, anything. My father passed away at 5AM, 13 of january.

He wasn't there with me in my graduation, all I had was a picture of him in my cellphone, I'm still unemployed because I dread to be in a hospital again, what if let any other person die? what if I did not not notice again the signs? I can't help but to feel useless all over again.

If you read this far, thank you for your time.

I'm so sorry dad, I wish I were enough to help you.",6,1749759304.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,0.88,False
1l9wo3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/thegriefmonkey/comments/1l9wo3q/the_dream_a_stream_of_consciousness_healing/,"""The Dream"", a stream of consciousness healing exercise","I have this dream within a dream within a dream in which I wake up from a nap on Mom's and Allen's living room couch, the one that we were sitting on when mom was being weird about Ray Lewis, going on and on about him being ""such an attractive man"". Allen was her husband, and is now her widower, but he was also a lifelong friend of the family, the uncle of one of my brother Chris's best friends from childhood. Allen had been ""Uncle Allen"" throughout our lives, and became ""Mr. Allen"" after he and my mother married several years before her passing. He was one of four husbands she had in her lifetime, one of only two she had married for love, and the only one I wish I had called ""dad"" back when he was still speaking to me. He doesn't know the truth about my falling out with mom, and so he believes whatever it is that she told him, which cannot possibly be the truth, as he hasn't spoken to me since. Had I been in a better place before mom died, I would've cleared things up with him, as I very much valued his presence in my life. I don't know that there's any use in telling him now, other than soothing my bruised ego at his rejection of my company as his stepdaughter, as he treats Chris as his stepson. The ego is a horrible reason to make any sort of decision, so after reaching out to him once out of love for him with no reply, I chose to leave Allen alone. Let the man have whatever peace of mind he has acquired without disturbance from the past. He had known and suffered mom's cruel side as I had. Let him have peace.

""Tangent."" Memories of coffee dates with Margie and Tony at Cup O' Joe flood over me. I hope they are well. I hope they are happy. Back to The Dream.

I wake up from a nap on that couch, and as I sit up, I see that Carmen and Aaron are in the room, as well, wide awake and to my left, further away than I am from the huge living room window that the stink bugs congregated in when it was that time of the year. The stink bugs are not in the dream, indicating that my dream does not occur within that time of the year. The kids are adults. Chris and I called Carmen and Aaron ""the kids"". That was until Chris's wife, Kari, gave birth to Sydni, the second of their three kids, and their only daughter. He then had his own kids, but Carmen and Aaron are forever ""the kids"" to me. They were the reason that I chose not to have children of my own. The thought of being too occupied raising my own children to be there for Carmen and Aaron was upsetting enough to me to bother my stomach. I felt resentment towards children that hadn't even been conceived. It was bizarre. I certainly wasn’t going to bring kids into this world to a mother who was as likely to not love them as she was to love them. 

That was probably the reason it didn't seem possible to me that both of them would leave this Earth before me. It's never ceased to be surreal. 

""Tangent,"" I say. Back to The Dream.

I wake up to Carmen and Aaron. They are sitting to my left. They are smiling. That makes me happy. It always did. I smile, too. Aaron says something funny. Carmen sucks her teeth and says, ""That's stupid."" Aaron says, ""You're stupid,"" but they're both still smiling and laughing. Carmen's smile was gentle most of the time, though when she beamed, she was stunning, even more beautiful than usual. Sometimes I found it necessary to catch my breath, and I would just take her beauty in, wondering hkw this angel came to be my sister. I was grateful for her, long before I understood what gratitude was. Aaron often laughed as he smiled, and his eyes became mischievous, and expectant of hilarity. He squinted. He had three squints. One occured when he was laughing, the second when he was contemplating something, and the third because he did not care to wear his prescription eyeglasses, and perpetually lost them when he did wear them as a result of his internal displeasure with them. Sometimes Carmen smiled for others, wanting them to be happy, nurturing, not people pleasing. Aaron smiled because he was amused, or because he was in the process of being amusing. 

A dream within a dream within a dream. Which dream is the dream? Am I sitting in the world now, writing about a time when they were here, when they were my world, when they defined me without my realizing it? Am I awake in a world of horrors without them? Or is this the dream that I will wake from, groggy from a nap, to find them sitting somewhere in a room with me? The dream of them is more real than anything that has happened since they've been gone. The world with them in it made sense. Even in times of confusion, the world that held them had more clarity than any aspect of this world that only knows their absence. 

This must be the dream, here where I sit writing. 

I would like to wake up now.

I want to wake up.

Wake me up, Carmen and Aaron. Grab me, and shake me, and wake me up. Can you hear me?

I hope they hear me.

1- know your weakness and focus on it, instead of reviewing topics that you‘re confident about.

2-train your mind using active recalling, like flashcards, way better than passive reading

3-don’t cram the night before the exam. Get good mental rest and good sleep (sleep early by 10 pm) that preserve your stamina.

4-wake up early by 7 am, get a high protein breakfast, greek yogurt with oat, and a black coffee if you run on caffeine like me, then dress in something comfortable(stay away from pockets)

  
<< During the exam >>  
1-read the last 2 lines first, as it saves time and help you focus on the information you are looking for.

2- highlight keywords, like age, lab results , concerning symptoms( i mean don’t just go and highlight nausea and tired..)

3-don’t leave any question without an answer, even if you have no clue, time isn’t guaranteed , give it a guess and mark it then move to next q.

4-take mini mental breaks, after every few questions, take a deep breath and tell yourself that you can do this.

5- take a break after each block to avoid burn out at the end of the exam.



<< After the exam >>  
1- what’s done is done and it’s gone. don’t try to look up any questions , forget it and move on , go play games, enjoy some fresh air, get quality time with your friends . trust God, trust the process, trust yourself.
