To achieve a childlike state for fast learning and creativity, adults need to reset their mindset to “baby mode”🧐🧐🤓🤯To hit “baby mode” – that clear-headed, curious-as-a-kid state – just grind through 23-24 hours of work, like cramming for exams while chugging coffee, chasing deadlines until your eyes scream and your brain goes “Error 404: Mind Not Found”. Your body’s like “I’m done, bro,” but your mind? It resets to zero, like a toddler staring wide-eyed at the world. To keep “baby mode” going, after you’re wiped out, find a quiet spot, ditch your phone, and take deep breaths for 5-10 minutes, picturing yourself as a phone on low battery getting a quick charge. Stretch that relaxation from 15 minutes, to 30, to an hour daily, and you’ll hold onto that kid-like curiosity to tackle big questions about the soul! Speaking of the soul, where’s it from? Imagine it’s a cosmic “data packet” uploaded into you at birth, like downloading an app from some fancy universe server. Buddhism says souls come from karma, looping through rebirths; Christianity claims God “installs” them for you to live and learn. Souls link to the physical world – trees, people – through emotions and thoughts, and to the invisible world – energy, spiritual realms – via gut feelings, like that shiver you get passing a creepy graveyard at midnight. When your body’s game over, where does the soul go? Buddhism says it might reincarnate as another person, a cat, or even your neighbor’s cactus, depending on your “karma score”. Christianity points to heaven or a much toastier spot hotter than a summer in Texas. But in sci-fi mode, maybe the soul’s a spark, a burst of consciousness, zipping through space, crossing galaxies, landing on another planet like, “Earth’s boring, let’s vibe on Mars!”. To dig deeper, stay in “baby mode” by asking kid-like questions: “Why do I feel my soul?”, “Can it take a galactic road trip?”. Try reading “Journey of Souls” by Michael Newton, or meditate 10 minutes daily, focusing on inner vibes, to tap into the invisible world. Stay curious, embrace mistakes like a kid, and the universe becomes a giant playground full of mysteries to explore!",1,1749823833.0,u_Green_Ad_4131,1,1.0,False

I am a 23 years old guy, living in Friesland, The Netherlands and I am looking for a long-term connection. 

I am currently enrolled in a bachelor's programme in a STEM-discipline at the University of Groningen. I love to go the extra mile, which is why I dedicate a lot of my time to numerous extracurriculars. When I am not studying, I prefer to spend time with family or friends. I love nature, some jazz in the background and a good cup of coffee. Once in a while I play some games or read, but I am better at buying books than actually reading them. A quick visual rundown: I am 174cm tall, blonde, white, have green/blue-ish eyes and I have a slim build.

I am looking for a woman living in the Netherlands, preferably relatively close by, who is ready for a long-term relationship. I generally prefer someone who’s on the quieter side and is passionate. Having at least 1 or 2 shared interests would be great, but we can discover those while we chat.

Start the chat with a screenshot of your Pinterest's For You-page, I would love to see your vibe!",1,1749823815.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Not complaining, but why?","I've been on an iced coffee kick for several weeks. I didn't even realize I was always getting a large until I stopped at a different Tim's last night and ordered my usual medium and it was a smaller cup (16 oz) than what I'm used to.

This isn't a case where someone is just hooking me up with a free upgrade. No one there knows me, I always use the drive thru, and regardless of what time I go, my medium coffee is always a large. They're not putting a medium amount of coffee in a large cup, which is what I'd expect if they were out of medium cups. If I order a small, I get a small.

I used to order Iced Capps and always got the cup size I ordered.

I ain't complaining, just curious. Is this a promotional thing? Training issue? Employees just don't GAF? I don't want to ask anyone there and ruin a good thing or risk getting someone in trouble over it, so that's why I'm asking here lol.",1,1749823694.0,TimHortons,1,1.0,False
1laguqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_uwu0876/comments/1laguqr/hello_im_back/,Hello! I'm back :),"Hi to whoever sees this, I haven't been active for the past four years because life hit hard. I'm now in college! But this isn't like a happy update I guess, more of another venting sesh. 

Just to recap, I have emotionally abusive parents, mainly my mom, but I guess I should talk about my dad too. I had a small time period a couple years ago where I vented about my mom. Mainly how she would get upset at me for having a B and hiding stuff from her. But a little bit about my dad: he's not the best, but I guess he isn't the worst. I read a lot of stories where the dad is like drunk and physically abusive, and my dad is nothing like that, but his way hurts too. My dad is horrible with money. And I don't mean like not being able to manage money, but more like he has no ambition. It might just be me, but he and my mom are like the worst couple ever. He has worked a government job for years, and it barely covers even a part of our monthly bills. He constantly takes loans that my mom has too pay off because he doesn't have any money. Like ever. My mom is the one who always pays his credit card bills. My mom is definitely the breadwinner, but I can never say that because of course his fragile ego would get hurt. But he is far more emotionally balanced than my mother. Yes, we've had disagreements, but he's rarely ever yelled. He's the type of dad who if I get a low score, he doesn't yell, but he is like: what are your next steps? what is your plan? You need to make sure you have a solid plan. And he like, tries to help, but he doesn't really understand how the school/classes work because he grew up in India. So he's better in that sense. But he doesn't have anything else in his life. No friends to hang out with (he just calls), no hobbies except drinking coffee all day, and spends the rest of the time either sleeping or on his phone. And he doesn't try to improve himself. He just sits. He does the dishwasher like once, but he has never cleaned like ever. He has never cleaned a bathroom or kitchen or anything like that in his life. I kind of understand my mom's outbursts now because she's the one who has to pick up the slack. It just took me a long time to realize it, since my dad was always the one to comfort me after one of my mom's yelling sessions. My mom literally handles everything: cooking, cleaning, working two jobs, investing, learning, real estate, anything that helps. My dad does nothing. He started to get on my nerves lately, because he acts like some high and mighty guy when he orders me to do stuff. Like if my mom is cleaning their room, he doesn't go help, he just says: go help your mother she needs you. Like tf? Are you not going to help? And he needs to be told what to do like a million times to get something done from him, or else me and my mom have to do it. So I guess I'm just talking about how both of them together is like a ticking time bomb because I'm the only buffer between them. 

I've been talking to my mom a lot more nowadays, and I just asked her: why didn't you ever divorce my dad? I know it sounds harsh, but it would be a lot easier. Like she faces all that on the daily, and then on top of that my grandma, dad's mom is like absolutely horrible. My mom would tell me about how her dad had to fund the entire wedding, with dowry, because my dad's parents refused to pay. She also told me about how she was so focused on pleasing his parents that she sold off a lot of her precious, sentimental jewlery because his mom didn't like it. She still regrets it to this day. She also told me about wheneve she and my dad fought, he would run back to his mommy, and she would sooth him, saying that he was a wonderful person and doesn't need to listen ot my mom. She literally raised her sons (my dad also has a brother who is the exact same) to believe that someone would wait on them constantly. And I was obviously shocked because my mom never really told me all of this, and I never really saw it either because my grandparents are in India. My mom says she only considered divocring once, but she said: we are family, we stick together, even through the tough times. I tried explaining to her that what my dad is doing is wrong, but she gets all mad AT ME, saying I shouldn't say that about my dad. I tried a couple more times, not about divorcing, just acknowledging the fact that he ain't a good person, but she gets pissed, saying that I should never say that about him. Like omfg. I gave up of course, wth am I supposed to do? I would just make a mental list of things that I would never allow a man to do in a relationship with me. Like don't get me wrong, I will support you through mental health, financial struggles, and everything else, but if I don't see/feel improvement, I will leave. I'm a no bs person, and I'm very blunt about what you are doing. Like, if you are depressed that's a whole other thing, but like, if you are just like oh life has no meaning after one bad day, then I would literally sit your down and be very blunt with you. Not pushing yourself to make sure you survive is a huge turn off. If he doesn't have a backbone either I'm out. I've been pretty logical in that sense, and I don't really believe in love, but more like mutral respect and care. Oh, and if he's a mama's boy, I'm actually kind of okay with it. Not like red flag, but there are some men out there that I'm sure have their own life, but care for their mother as well. I don't mind them having a close relationship, as long as she and I respect each other. I don't know, I feel like I've become a toxic person as well because of growing up with these types of parents.   
  
About me, I've gained a lot more weight ever since I got to college, but now I'm working on losing it. It's slow, but I've lost 20 pounds so far! I already feel a lot better about how I look, and I'm excited to lose more! I got into an average college, with my grades not being the best in high school. I crashed first semester, because I just had no motivation. I ended up with a really low GPA my first semester, and I literally slapped myself to make sure I do better then next semester. Much higher GPA the next semester, like all As. I make sure I keep that motivation throughout. I'm in a major I really like, completely different from my parents, but I'm super happy with myself now. My parents' still affect me, and I guess you could say that I've forgiven them, but I'll never forget it. Besides, my parents are paying for my college. But I try to remember all the things I've accomplished, the clubs and programs I am part of and stuff like that.

Well, that was a pretty long update! I'm not sure if I'll post/comment more often but to whoever reads this, thank you for reading it, and I hope you have a great life!",1,1749823688.0,u_uwu0876,0,1.0,False

Writes me a letter explaining,"My former best friend was matron of honor in my wedding, we did a lot together, and we were tight. Fifteen years ago my DH died, leaving me a young widow with a 1&4 yr old. Friend, we will call Kim, comes into town with her DD and stays at our condo for wake and funeral. During the wake she left for a couple hours to meet friends for dinner. Then the next morning, my 1 year old is screaming while I’m trying to get her dressed for funeral, and Kim just stands there and sips her coffee. She doesn’t come to funeral. 
Four and a half weeks after he died, coroner calls to tell my cause. I call Kim
And tell her and ask her why she hasn’t returned texts or calls. She says she has a lot going on. 
After we hung up, I decided that I wasn’t going to work or put any effort into our friendship. If she wants to be a good friend, she will reach out. 
Nope. Oh wait, she did once. To ask if I wanted to go to her high school reunion with her. One day notice, and I have two small children. How selfish. Anyhow, fast forward 15.5 years and I get a letter in the mail. She’s explaining how she felt so sad and how her marriage was crumbling and she sought out someone else. She had an affair and it really hurt her DH and kids. Meanwhile in social media, everything looks fantastic. She looks like she is enjoying her life…so yeah, never believe everything on SM, eh? 
Anyhow, in her letter she wrote all about how much she was hurting and how ashamed she feels and hopes the letter explains how she failed me as a friend. 
After so many years, it does still bother me, but also after so many years she finally has the guts to confess to me. I guess I should be gentle with her and give her grace. But I don’t want to. Not once in her letter did she ask how I am doing or saying she hopes I am doing well. I guess I just think she is selfish. 
AITA for not wanting to write her back? At least not now. Herbs band is the one who reached out to ask for my address. She has my phone number and address, which is weird. 

Anyhow, I guess I’m wondering if I ATA If I don’t answer and continue to not invest in the friendship. She didn’t for over 15 years after I lost the LOML. It has not been easy at all

1lagq78,https://ncse.info/post-quantum-tools-guide/,Spent my weekend diving into quantum-safe encryption and... holy crap,"Okay, so I've been putting this off for months. You know how it is - you hear about quantum computers breaking encryption and think yeah yeah, future problem. Well, I finally sat down and actually learned this stuff. And now I can't unsee it. Started because my company had a security audit last month. The auditor casually mentioned ""post-quantum readiness"" and literally everyone in the room went quiet. Nobody had a clue what to do about it.

So this weekend, instead of binging Netflix, I went full nerd mode. Coffee, multiple monitors, the works. Here's what's messing with my head: the NSA and NIST aren't just saying ""maybe worry about this someday."" They're saying organizations need to start transitioning NOW. Not because quantum computers exist today, but because our data has a shelf life. Think about it - if you're encrypting something today that needs to stay secret for 10+ years (medical records, government docs, financial data), you're already in the danger zone. Bad actors are literally stealing encrypted data now to decrypt later. It has a name: ""Harvest Now, Decrypt Later.""

The good news? The solutions actually exist. I spent hours implementing CRYSTALS-Kyber (the new NIST standard) and it's... surprisingly not that hard? Like, I expected some mind-bending math, but the libraries (shoutout to Open Quantum Safe) make it pretty straightforward. What really got me was the performance. I ran benchmarks expecting these new algorithms to be slow as hell. Nope. Kyber is actually FASTER than RSA for most operations. My mind = blown. The frustrating part is how little practical info is out there. Tons of academic papers, sure, but barely any ""here's how you actually DO this"" guides. So I ended up documenting everything as I learned it. Code examples, benchmarks, which algorithms to use for what, migration strategies, the whole nine yards. But honestly, the biggest takeaway for me wasn't technical. It's that we're all sitting on a ticking time bomb and most of us don't even know it. Every day we wait is another day of data that might be compromised in the future. Anyone else been down this rabbit hole? How's your org handling it? Or are you like we were - hoping it'll just go away? 😅",3,1749823368.0,programming,1,0.71,False

Below is the full, corrected version of your Reddit article, formatted in **Reddit markdown** for easy copy-paste directly into the r/panamaexpats subreddit.

# Grocery Shopping in Panama as an Expat: What to Expect, Where to Go, and How Much You'll Spend

Whether you’re new to Panama or just considering the move, one of the biggest day-to-day changes you’ll notice is how different grocery shopping feels here. Some parts will remind you of home—but a lot won’t. Here's what I've learned after spending time navigating the aisles of Panama’s supermarkets, local markets, and neighborhood tiendas.

# 🛒 The Grocery Shopping Landscape in Panama

Grocery shopping in Panama is a mix of modern and traditional. You’ve got big chain supermarkets with everything under one roof, tiny corner stores (called **tiendas** or **minisúpers**) for quick essentials, and local produce stands that often have fresher fruits and veggies than the bigger stores.

In cities like Panama City, David, and even medium-sized towns like Boquete or Las Tablas, you'll find clean, air-conditioned supermarkets that feel pretty familiar. But the further out you go, the more you’ll rely on smaller shops and open-air markets.

# 🇺🇸🇵🇦 Panama vs. U.S. & Canada: Grocery Shopping Differences

Here are a few things that might surprise you:

* **Brand selection is more limited** – Especially for American/Canadian products. You might not find your favorite cereal or coffee creamer.
* **More local products** – Expect to see a lot more Latin American brands, which are often cheaper and sometimes just as good.
* **Produce varies seasonally** – If it’s not in season locally, it’s probably not available.
* **Customer service is more relaxed** – Don’t expect “greeters” or baggers everywhere. Sometimes you bag your own groceries.

# 💵 Price Check: Groceries in Panama vs. North America (2025)

Prices vary depending on where you shop and how “imported” your tastes are. Here's a detailed comparison of **30+ grocery items**—Panama prices based on June 2025 data from Riba Smith, El Machetazo, and PriceSmart:

|**Item**|**Panama (USD)**|**U.S. Average (USD)**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1 liter of milk|$1.30|$1.20|
|1 dozen eggs|$2.00|$3.00|
|Chicken breast (1 lb)|$2.50|$4.50|
|Ground beef (1 lb)|$3.00|$5.00|
|Strip steak (12 oz)|$5.75|$10.50|
|Pork chops (1 lb)|$2.75|$4.50|
|Whole chicken (per lb)|$1.25|$2.50|
|Rice (2 lbs, local)|$1.25|$2.00|
|Pasta (500g, local brand)|$1.10|$1.80|
|Beans (1 lb, dried)|$1.00|$1.60|
|Tomatoes (per lb)|$0.90|$1.90|
|Onions (per lb)|$0.85|$1.40|
|Carrots (per lb)|$0.60|$1.20|
|Potatoes (per lb)|$0.65|$1.10|
|Lettuce (1 head)|$0.75|$1.60|
|Bananas (per lb)|$0.30|$0.60|
|Pineapple (each)|$1.00|$3.00|
|Apples (per lb, imported)|$2.20|$1.80|
|Bread (sliced loaf, local)|$1.75|$3.00|
|Coca-Cola (2 liter)|$1.90|$2.50|
|Imported cereal (Kellogg’s)|$5.50|$4.00|
|Butter (local, 1/2 lb)|$1.75|$2.50|
|Yogurt (small, local brand)|$0.85|$1.20|
|Cheese (local queso fresco, 1 lb)|$2.50|$4.00|
|Cheese (imported cheddar, 1 lb)|$5.25|$5.50|
|Domestic beer (6-pack)|$3.75|$9.00|
|Domestic rum (750ml)|$4.50–$7.00|$10.00+|
|Imported whiskey (750ml)|$25–$35|$30–$40|
|Coffee (ground, local, 14 oz)|$3.50|$6.00|
|Cooking oil (1 liter, local)|$2.75|$3.50|
|Sugar (2 lbs)|$1.20|$2.00|
|Laundry detergent (medium)|$5.25|$7.50|
|Toilet paper (4-pack)|$1.95|$3.00|
|Dish soap (small bottle)|$1.25|$2.50|

**Bottom line**: Local items are very affordable. Imports? Not so much.

# 💡 Why Are Prices More Affordable for Expats?

Panama is still a **developing economy**, and the average Panamanian salary reflects that. Minimum wage is around **$400–$650/month**, depending on the industry. Because of this, most food and grocery prices are set with locals in mind—**not international visitors**.

Expats earning pensions or remote income in dollars often find that their buying power goes a long way. But keep in mind: imported goods are priced high to reflect tariffs and shipping costs.

# 🏪 Major Grocery Stores in Panama

If you’re in or near a city, these are the chains you’ll see most often:

* **Riba Smith** – Most “American-style.” Great for imports and variety. Pricier, but reliable.
* **Super 99** – Big chain with decent prices, fewer imports.
* **Rey** – Popular and widespread. Good selection and balance.
* **Xtra** – Budget-friendly, more local brands.
* **El Machetazo** – More of a hybrid store (like a Walmart meets a supermarket). Often has good prices on basic goods and home items. The Panamanian man/woman on the street shops here for good reason--very affordable prices
* **Super Baru** (in Chiriquí/Boquete region) – Popular with expats for selection and service.
* **PriceSmart** – Membership-based (like Costco). Great for bulk buying, especially for expat families or shared households.

Don’t skip **ferias** (open-air markets) for fresh produce and meats—they're where many locals shop, and you’ll often get better quality for less.

# ✅ Grocery Shopping Do's and Don'ts for Expats

**DO:**

* Learn the Spanish names for your staple foods (e.g., *pollo*, *arroz*, *leche*).
* Bring reusable bags—plastic is being phased out in many areas.
* Check expiration dates—turnover can be slow in smaller shops.
* Use local brands to save serious money.
* **Sign up for loyalty programs** at your favorite store, and download their app. Some stores offer decent discounts or member-only promotions.

**DON'T:**

* Assume all staff speak English (many don’t).
* Expect customer service like in the U.S. or Canada.
* Buy imported products every time—they’ll drain your wallet.
* Forget to check out the weekly deals or flyers.
* **Don't forget to tip the baggers.** Most are teens or seniors, and many **aren’t paid by the store**—they rely on tips. A few coins or a dollar or two is appreciated, especially if they help carry your groceries out.

# 🧾 Summary: What to Expect and How to Save

Grocery shopping in Panama isn’t hard—it’s just different. You’ll adjust fast--because, you gotta eat. Shop local when you can, learn a little Spanish, and don’t stress if you can’t find your favorite brand of peanut butter. You’ll discover something new that you love just as much. Pack your patience, and open your palate.

And if all else fails? Hit up PriceSmart for that Costco-style comfort zone.

[And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him in and explained to him the way of God more accurately. — Acts 18:26 ](https://preview.redd.it/4hnvvjctap6f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5abc9698c125cc1d788aded08e87dd61a9c9e166)

**To do Christian work well**, we need to know the full gospel.

Apollos was a Christian, passionate and eloquent, but his knowledge of Christ only went as far as John the Baptist’s teachings. Priscilla and Aquila heard him preach and recognized this shortcoming.

They saw that he didn’t yet know about Christ’s death and resurrection. After they taught him the full gospel, he became a much more powerful preacher.

One of the best things we can do for others is to encourage them. More than half the people we meet on any given day need encouragement. One of the worst things we can do is to be a discourager.

Perhaps the problem with many Christians is similar to what Paul found in a group of men at Ephesus—they hadn’t even heard that the Holy Spirit had come. We can only have power in witnessing for Christ when we are filled with the Spirit.",1,1749823246.0,TheDailyDose,0,1.0,False

okay so this is gonna be long but i need to get this off my chest because everyone keeps telling me different things and i'm losing my mind.

my husband got in a really bad car accident three months ago. like really bad. he was in a coma for two weeks and then the ICU for another month. the doctors weren't sure if he was gonna make it at first. i spent every single day at that hospital. sleeping in those awful chairs, eating vending machine food, watching him hooked up to all those machines.

here's where it gets complicated. during the second week when he was still unconscious, i met this guy in the hospital cafeteria. he was there because his mom was having surgery. we started talking and he was just so kind and understanding about everything i was going through. nobody else really got it, you know? my family kept saying ""stay positive"" and his family was dealing with their own stuff.

we exchanged numbers and started texting. at first it was just support stuff. then it got more personal. he'd bring me coffee when i was at the hospital. we'd sit in his car and just talk for hours about how scared we both were.

one night when the doctors said my husband was stable but still critical, this guy asked if i wanted to get out of the hospital for a few hours. just to breathe. we went to his apartment and we ended up sleeping together. and then it happened two more times over the next week.

my husband woke up but he's been different since the accident. really different. he has nightmares, gets angry over small things, won't talk about what happened. the VA therapist says it's ptsd from the crash and his time overseas.

here's the thing though. when i told the therapist about how stressed i was during his hospital stay, she said i might have trauma too from watching him almost die. i mentioned how isolated i felt and how this one person really helped me through it. i didn't say we slept together but i talked about how guilty i felt for leaning on someone else when my husband needed me.

the therapist said it was completely normal to seek support during a crisis and that i shouldn't feel guilty for taking care of my mental health too. she said wives and families often need just as much help as the patients.

so now i'm wondering if what i did was actually that bad? like yes i cheated but i was traumatized too. i thought my husband was going to die. i was completely alone and this guy was the only person who understood what i was going through.

my husband still doesn't know. he's been going to therapy twice a week and taking medication for his ptsd. we barely have sex anymore because of his issues. sometimes i think about telling him but then i think it would just make his mental health worse.

the guy from the hospital texted me last week asking how i was doing. i haven't responded but part of me wants to. not to hook up again but just because he was there for me when nobody else was.

my sister says i'm a horrible person and that trauma doesn't excuse cheating. but my therapist friend says people do crazy things when they're in crisis mode and that i was basically having a breakdown.

i keep going back and forth on this. was i just a scared wife who made a mistake during the worst time of her life? or am i just a cheater trying to justify what i did?

so reddit, AITA for what happened during those hospital weeks? should i tell my husband or just let it go since he's dealing with so much already?",1,1749823225.0,FoundandExpose,0,1.0,False

**The Retail Battle for Attention has a New Player.**  

In-store marketing is no longer about being seen. It’s about being remembered. Brands across malls, trade shows, and public spaces are battling shrinking attention spans, rising customer acquisition costs, and saturated visual environments. Static signage and traditional displays are quickly losing their edge. 

Enter the [Advertising Robot, Odigo](https://kodyrobots.com/odigo/), The AI-enabled brand ambassador that doesn’t just display dynamic ads but delivers them and moves with them in real time. And at the front of this revolution is Odigo, a smart advertising robot designed to roam, engage, and drive footfall where it matters most- revenue generation. 



**What Is an Advertising Robot?** 

An Advertising Robot is a mobile, autonomous robot that is built to promote brands, products, and services in high-footfall environments, like shopping malls or airports, etc. Unlike static banners or digital screens, these Odigo robots can move, speak, interact, and react, turning traditional advertising into a live, engaging experience. 

**Key Traits of a Smart Advertising Robot like Odigo Robot:** 

* Mobility: Moves across malls, expos, or events to maximize ad visibility. 

* 360° Brand Display: LED screens or panel wraps ensure visibility from all angles. 

* Voice Interaction: Many can greet customers or deliver scripted messages in multiple languages. 

* Sensor Intelligence: Intelligent navigation allows safe movement through crowds and tight spaces. 

* Autonomous Operation: No human driver or remote control is needed. 

* Custom Branding: Outer shell and on-screen content are fully brandable. 

Odigo Robot exemplifies all of this. It’s not just a robot; it’s a mobile advertising robot built to entertain, inform, and convert. 

Whether in a shopping mall, tech showroom, or international expo, advertising robots like Odigo offer a fresh channel for reaching people where they already are but with more movement, memory, and impact. 

 

**Why Traditional In-Store Marketing Falls Short** 

In a hyper-competitive retail space, traditional in-store advertising methods like static banners, backlit posters, and wall screens are struggling to keep up with consumer behavior. These formats are passive and repetitive and often go unnoticed by shoppers conditioned to tune out background noise. 

**Key Limitations:** 

* Static & Stationary: They don’t move, so they can’t reach foot traffic across multiple zones. 

* No Interaction: They can’t talk, greet, or respond, which makes them easy to ignore. 

* Poor Targeting: Most don’t adjust based on time, location, or crowd patterns. 

* Limited Visibility: Brands in less-trafficked areas often get minimal attention. 

* Hard to Track ROI: No way to know who saw the ad, for how long, or whether it worked. 

This is exactly where an Advertising Robot like Odigo disrupts the status quo. Odigo doesn’t just display content. It moves, engages targets, and measures.  

Whether guiding visitors to a store or streaming promotions on the move, it ensures ads aren’t just seen but remembered. 



**Meet Odigo: The Advertising Robot in Action** 

Odigo, From Kody Robots, isn’t just a display screen on wheels. It’s a fully autonomous advertising robot built with precision, performance, and marketing impact in mind. Whether in a mall, airport, showroom, or outdoor venue, Odigo transforms physical spaces into interactive brand playgrounds.  

Here’s what makes Odigo stand out: 

**Smart AI Navigation** 

Odigo autonomously roams high-traffic areas using AI-based navigation and intelligent obstacle avoidance, ensuring smooth movement through crowds, corridors, and open spaces. It can operate independently with customizable speed settings, adapting to footfall density and mall dynamics. 

**Dynamic Ad Display on All Sides** 

Odigo features two full HD digital screens, front and back, and it includes both a 32-inch touch display and gesture control features.  

This setup ensures 360-degree ad visibility, even when the robot is in motion. 

* Front: 32"" vertical ad screen 

* Back: 32"" vertical ad screen 

**Interactive Engagement** 

Odigo isn’t just visual; it interacts. With interactive displays, it interacts in multiple languages and even reacts to gestures. It becomes a two-way brand interaction tool, not just an ad surface. 

**Amazing Hour Battery & Automated Charging** 

Designed for endurance, Odigo runs up to 8 plus hours on a single charge and auto-docks when needed. No need for constant supervision or manual recharging. 

**Centralized Dashboard & Real-Time Analytics** 

Marketers and mall managers can control content, monitor performance, and track engagement from a centralized dashboard. Campaigns can be adjusted in real-time, ensuring maximum flexibility and ROI. 

**Purpose-Built for Malls, Airports & Events**

**6 Ways Odigo Is Redefining Experiential Marketing** 

Odigo doesn’t just enhance your campaigns. It redefines the very experience of advertising inside malls and public venues.  

From moving around to interacting with people, here is how Odigo, the smart advertising robot from Kody Robots, does things that regular display screens just can’t. 

**1. Turns Heads with Mobile Brand Visibility** 

Unlike fixed digital displays, Odigo Robot moves with purpose. It attracts attention across zones, ensuring your ad isn’t limited to one small location. Whether it's patrolling high-footfall zones or reaching quieter corners, your amazing brand stays constantly visible at all times. 

**2. Engages Shoppers with Interactive Experiences** 

Odigo has two 32-inch touchscreens and can understand hand gestures, making ads more interactive. People can check offers, ask for directions, or explore brand content, which helps them stay longer and engage more.

**3. Delivers Targeted Ads Based on Time and Location** 

Odigo Robots can display different ads at different times or zones, making campaigns more relevant and profitable. Morning coffee promos near food courts? Evening retail flash sales near anchor stores? Odigo adapts in real-time to context. 

**4. Boosts Store Footfall and Sales** 

Odigo guides visitors to stores, especially those in low-visibility zones. With voice prompts and clear digital signposting, it funnels customers to specific stores, increasing walk-ins and encouraging purchases. 

**5. Maximizes Campaign ROI with Real-Time Controls** 

Marketers or the concerned person can fully or partially manage Odigo Robot remotely through a centralized AI-powered dashboard, adjusting creatives, messages, and targeting on the go. Plus, real-time analytics help track impressions, engagement, and performance across campaigns. 

**6. Blends Seamlessly with Retail & Event Environments** 

From its sleek futuristic design to ultra-low-noise operation, Odigo Robot is built to complement modern retail and event spaces. It doesn’t just grab complete attention; it enhances the ambiance while delivering marketing results. 

In short, Odigo turns marketing into movement, connecting shoppers to brands in a way that’s interactive, measurable, and unforgettable. 

**Where Advertising Robots Like Odigo Work Best** 

Advertising robots aren’t limited to one sector or space. Odigo’s modular design, AI navigation, and mobile advertising features make it adaptable across multiple commercial environments, delivering impact wherever attention matters. 

Let’s explore where Odigo truly shines: 

**Shopping Malls** 

Odigo Robot helps shopping malls or large malls to turn big casual foot traffic into deep targeted brand engagement. It guides visitors, promotes ongoing deals, and drives traffic to under-visited retail stores, increasing both store visibility and overall sales per visitor. 

**Airports & Transit Hubs** 

With thousands of travelers in constant motion, Odigo becomes a moving billboard that delivers high recall in low-attention environments. Its multilingual voice prompts and navigation assistance offer functional value and branded engagement at once. 

**Expos, Trade Shows & Product Launches** 

At exhibitions, Odigo acts as a roaming brand ambassador. It showcases new products, directs attendees to your booth, and creates a tech-forward brand experience, something traditional roll-ups and backdrops can’t achieve. 

**Retail Showrooms** 

In large-format retail spaces, Odigo helps buyers explore product categories, highlight bestsellers, or broadcast promotions across departments. It complements retail storytelling with movement and digital interaction. 

**Outdoor Brand Activations** 

Thanks to Odigo’s smart movement and weather-resistant hardware, it can be integrated into outdoor media plans. Think of it as a futuristic extension of digital billboards but mobile, interactive, and measurable. 

**Hotels, Convention Centers & Multiplexes** 

Odigo acts as a guide and advertiser in large spaces, greeting guests, promoting upgrades, or even showing branded offers related to nearby services or retailers. 

Wherever there’s footfall, distraction, and competition for attention, Odigo becomes a mobile edge. It’s not just about presence; it’s about movement that converts. 



**ROI and Business Impact of Advertising Robots** 

Investing in a smart advertising robot like Odigo in 2025 isn’t just about looking like futuristic robotics. It’s about delivering measurable business results. Odigo is designed to support both marketing performance and operational efficiency across malls, retail chains, and media zones. 

Here’s how Odigo creates real value: 

**Increased Store Footfall** 

Odigo’s ability to guide visitors to less visible stores helps brands attract more walk-ins, especially those positioned far from entrances or anchor spots. It not only redirects traffic but also holds shoppers' attention during the journey. 

**Higher Brand Recall** 

With constant mobility, multi-angle screens, and a futuristic look, Odigo makes branded messages unforgettable. Unlike static signage that blends into the background, this robot sparks curiosity and sticks in memory even with short exposures. 

**Smarter Campaign Optimization** 

Thanks to Odigo’s real-time analytics, advertisers can track impressions, dwell times, and interactions, enabling data-driven adjustments mid-campaign. You don’t waste ad spend. You learn and iterate. 

**Better ROI vs Traditional In-Store Ads** 

Traditional in-store ads like posters, standees, and digital screens have one big problem. They stay in one spot and show the same message to everyone. They can’t move, they don’t interact, and changing the content takes time and effort. 

Odigo, a smart advertising robot, transforms everything. 

It moves around your space, taking your ads to more places and more people. Its 360-degree screens show your message from every side, whether it's moving or standing still. Plus, dual touchscreens make your ads more engaging and memorable. 

What’s even better is that you can control everything in real time. Update ads, track results, and fine-tune your campaign instantly, all from one dashboard. This contrasts sharply with traditional media, where performance is hard to measure, and changes are slow and expensive. With Odigo, advertisers gain measurable insights, more flexibility, and, ultimately, a much higher return on investment. 

What It Means for Your Business 

* Mall Owners see higher footfall and better advertiser retention. 

* Retailers see increased walk-ins and faster conversions. 

* Advertisers get better campaign reach, data, and returns.

Whether you're selling electronics or launching a new perfume line, Odigo moves your message in the right direction, literally and financially. 



**The Future of Experiential Marketing Is Mobile, Smart & Human-Centric** 

As digital fatigue grows and static ads fade into the background, the future of marketing lies in real-world experiences that move, talk, and adapt. The age of advertising robots is not just a tech novelty. It's a strategic leap toward more meaningful, measurable engagement. 

Ad robots like Odigo mark a real change from just showing ads to telling brand stories in a smarter way. They move, collect data, and easily fit into places where people already shop, travel, or spend time. Odigo doesn’t just display ads. It helps, guides, entertains, and encourages more and more people to take action. 

Whether you're managing a mall, launching a new store, or organizing a global event, Odigo offers a new medium that blends utility with creativity and visibility with intelligence. It's built for a world where attention is hard to win and harder to keep. 

If you're planning your next big campaign, ask yourself this: Are your ads moving with your audience or just standing still?

1lagmt9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lagmt9,"Catalonia Royal Bavaro, first time there and my experience","This year the wife and I did something different for our vacation. We generally like to head to Las Vegas in the spring, but because of the political climate we opted to try something new.

I'm not really what you would call a resort guy or at least that's what I thought. I generally love waking up and just wandering around to take in the sites and sounds of wherever I am (not really something you can do on a resort). I'm not even a beach guy...I live 2 minutes from lake Huron and I can't tell you the last time I sat on the beach there. So the initial idea of spending a week on an island resort not even on my bucket list.

We stayed at the Catalonia Royal Bavaro during Easter. First and foremost it's a gorgeous adult only resort. There wasn't a time in the day or night I didn't catch staff cleaning and maintaining the property to keep it pristine.

The staff were always happy and willing to help, and let's face it the bartenders can make a wicked long Island ice tea and whisky sour!

There were events going on every day and at night to keep the guests entertained. If you didn't like what was happening there you could freely walk over to the family resort next door and check out the shops, entertainment and food as well as gambling.  The coffee shop on the board walk does make an awesome cappuccino!

The food was decent from the buffets to the ala carts, but if your like me and like spices or flavors you may find it bland.

The only real let down I had of my experience in the Dominican was once you left the resort, I found the island to be a bit of a shithole. I know it's because of poverty and huge contrasts of the have and have nots. But seeing the garbage and waste all over the place while traveling around is a huge disappointment, like as if the people don't have pride in where they live and don't realize how gorgeous the island is.

But that is my take on my first island experience. Would love to hear from others who have gone to Catalonia and what their experiences are!",0,1749823159.0,PuntaCana,0,0.5,False

Carol: Let’s see who in this company would be worth asking? Well no one in your department. Not ethical. Too young.
Sales department? Too married too divorced too sleepy.

Lois: Carol you do love to stereotype.

Carol: Yea makes it easier to eliminate the unworthy.
Ok Accounting?  Nah old men and young women.  
Executives?  Old but they do have money.

Lois:   Who?

Carol:   Nick from IT

Lois:   Really?  No.  Hmmm Let me think about it.

Carol:   But don’t over think it.
Back to work.

Next day Lois went into the break room first thing in the morning. Something she rarely does. But she had a need for caffeine.  Pouring a cup of coffee was Nick from IT.

Nick:  Good morning Lois.  Can I pour you a cup?

Lois nodded yes.
As Nick poured Lois said:  Nick can I ask you something?  She pointed the way to a far table.
Lois: I need to ask you something in private Nick.  But not here.  Can you meet me tomorrow after work?  But not at anyplace around here.

Nick:   Sure Lois. Text me later and we’ll figure a place to meet.  I have a meeting right now.

Lois:  that’ll work.
She let out a sigh of relief.

Nick was wondering what it was all about. But he had work to do.

Later that day Lois texted Nick:  Do you have any place we can chat away from work area?
Nick texted: You live in Hatboro and I live in Chalfont. How about Jim’s in Warminster?  Just up York rd from you.
Lois:  ok  I know where that is. 7 pm?
Nick: ok good.  I’ll meet you at the bench outside.

At 6:50 Nick sat down on the bench in front of Jim’s.  He figured it would be easier for Lois   If he was there first.
Two minutes later Lois was there.

Lois:   Nick thanks for coming.  You must be wondering what is so private not to talk at or near work.

Nick:   Lois I had several ideas what it could be.  Most were too incredible to make any sense.
But let’s get a seat and relax a second.

They were seated at a booth.  Lois ordered white wine, Nick a beer.

Nick:   Lois what would you like to eat?  They have excellent roast beef sandwiches.

Lois:   Oh nothing for me thanks.  I’m too nervous.

Nick:   Says the girl who probably only had coffee for breakfast. Eat half her sandwich for lunch. And now is drinking wine . 

Lois:   Nick have you been spying on me?  I had a bagel for breakfast and almost ate all my sandwich for lunch.  Ok? (Ok had a sarcastic tone)

Nick:  I’m going to order a few appetizers.  You can watch me eat or eat them too.
I think I’ll have loaded tater tots, stuffed mushrooms and mozzarella sticks.

Lois:   Did you say stuffed mushrooms?  Oh I love them.  Oh they have onion rings and chicken bites.  
Nick good idea! We can chat and eat comfort foods.

Nick:   I thought you may pass out on me if you didn’t eat.
So what did you want to ask me?

Lois took a sip of her wine.  Took a deep breath and said:  I have a wedding I’m invited to and I was wondering if you would be my date? 

Nick:   What happened to Jake your boyfriend?

Lois:  he hasn’t been around since before Christmas.

Nick:   Oh sorry 

Lois:   Time to move on.

Nick:   About time… to talk about the wedding.

Lois: The wedding is two weeks from Saturday.  It’s upstate and I have to be there for the rehearsal dinner on Friday.  It would be great if you could get Friday off and we can go together.  You can stay at my parents house with me and use my brothers old room.

Nick:   No problem. I have enough days owed me to get off.
But I do have a few questions.

Gavin was thirty-seven. Immaculate in appearance. By day, he worked in a glass office, perched high above the city like a crow on a wire. At home, he shared a downtown apartment with Eric—twenty-two, gentle-eyed and pale-skinned. Gavin liked to cook. Each evening without fail, he prepared dinner for them both.

Eric couldn’t recall a single time he’d cooked a meal himself. The kitchen simply belonged to Gavin, as did the unspoken rules that governed their quiet domestic life.

And so, every night, Gavin cooked.

And Eric ate.

Eric hummed softly as he ate, savoring every bite, wiping a smear of sauce from the corner of his mouth. “Thank you for covering dinner again. It’s amazing. Like always.”

Gavin smiled in response.

“You can thank me later,” he said, voice low and silk-smooth. Then he winked.

Eric blushed, ducking his head slightly.

Gavin watched him chew, watched him swallow.

It made him happy to see Eric eat.

And so the day would come when the freezer was nearly empty.

One evening after Eric had gone to sleep, curled beneath a soft linen sheet, Gavin slid on his coat and stepped into the city’s cold breath.

# The villain wins. Doomsday blues.

Genre: Dark, Apocalyptic, Gay dark Romance (18+)

 *Clover*, is the hero—born from the goddess Gia. The villain is from *Born of Hades*. This is an apocalyptic dark gay romance RP.

Clover’s body is bound tightly to the edge of the tallest skyscraper in New York. The ropes biting into his skin.

Clover‘s mind is numb, haunted by the endless firestorm consuming the city below. Buildings collapse in blazing infernos, streets run red with ash and smoke, and the distant cries of despair echo up to where he’s trapped.

For ten brutal years, he fought—relentlessly clashing with the son of Hades in a war that shattered the world. But now, after a decade of Selfless sacrifice.

The villain stands victorious, and Clover is left a broken.

Prompt 3: A horror and survival rp.

“Love thy neighbour.”

Edward is a 33-year-old man living in a quiet, middle-class suburban neighborhood. His life appears, on the surface, to be rather ordinary. He works as an IT technician—a job that provides stability, but little satisfaction. His personal life has been a series of quiet disappointments.

A year ago, he went through a devastating breakup with his wife. Their marriage had barely lasted a few weeks before she discovered his secret—his homosexuality. She tore apart his character, denouncing him to their mutual friends in the church community they had once been a part of. The slander was swift and brutal. Edward found himself cast out—not just from his marriage, but from the very social network that had once been his anchor.

One of the few constants in Edward’s life now is his neighbor, Roy, who has quietly become a close friend. Roy lives next door in a house that’s a stark contrast to Edward's modest home. The house, with its three floors, basement, and—oddly—its wine cellar, seems almost out of place in this suburban neighborhood. Roy, tall at 6'4"", often towers over Edward, who stands at 5'9.

Every Saturday and Sunday evening, the two of them find themselves on Roy’s front porch, drinks in hand. It was a warm afternoon when Edward—Eddy, as Roy called him—found himself in the garden again. Trimming dead stems, watering the soil, and watching as the flowers bloomed every spring.

For a moment, he caught a strange, faint odor. He took in a deep breath, trying to pinpoint the source. At first, he thought it was the compost pile near the fence, but that didn’t quite explain it. The smell wasn’t like rotting vegetables; it was heavier, more organic.

He considered Roy’s house next door. Maybe Roy had been hunting again and had left some animal remains out to decompose? The day wore on, and the mild scent lingered. The windows were dark, and Roy had been quiet all day. There were no signs of movement, no headlights in the driveway, nothing to suggest Roy was home.

Edward’s feet itched to investigate, but he hesitated. What was he supposed to do? Knock on the door and ask if Roy had left a dead animal out for too long? He took a step toward the fence, and then stopped.

The next day, a Saturday afternoon. The sun hung low in the sky, casting a golden glow over the neighborhood. Roy appeared at the end of the driveway, walking toward Edward’s. His broad shoulders pulling at the sleeves of his T-shirt. His hair.

“Eddy!” Roy’s voice was warm and boisterous, like they hadn’t spoken in months, not just a few days. “Look at this! The garden’s looking fantastic. These roses, man.”

Edward smiled. “Thanks, Roy. It’s just a lot of patience, I guess.” He straightened up from his crouch, brushing off his knees as he dusted his hands on his jeans.

Roy’s grin widened. Roy’s smile curled into a more knowing, almost self-satisfied grin. “Well, I’ve got a bottle of 2015 Château Lafite Rothschild down in the cellar. You ever had that?”

“2015 Château Lafite Rothschild?” Edward repeated, trying to keep the tone casual. “That sounds pretty fancy.”

Roy’s eyes lit up. Edward felt a flicker of discomfort. Just a pinch of discomfort.

Edward wasn’t exactly a wine connoisseur, but even he knew that Château Lafite Rothschild wasn’t just something anyone could casually open up on a Saturday night.

“I mean, sure, sounds great,” Edward said, trying to sound as casual as possible. “If you’re offering, I’ll take you up on it.”

Roy clapped him on the back with a little more force than necessary, his eyes lingering for just a moment too long before he stepped back. Edward smiled awkwardly, watching as Roy walked back toward his house.

Eddy looked back down at his garden, the roses now seeming somehow less beautiful, less peaceful, than they had before.

Later that evening, Edward stepped inside, the familiar scent of Roy’s home—wood and leather. Edward took the glass, swirling it for a moment before taking a sip. The taste was exquisite.

“So, how’s work been?” Roy asked, casually settling into an armchair across from him.

“Same as it’s always been,” Edward said, smiling softly. Edward added, “I noticed something... Is the plumbing in your house okay? I mean, I’ve been smelling something... a little off? Could be coming from the pipes or something.”

Roy’s smile didn’t falter. He leaned back in his chair, looking almost amused.

“Rot?” Roy repeated. “We’ve had a bit of moisture in the basement recently—pipes can get a little musty down there...”

Edward nodded.

As the night went on, the taste of the wine started to lose its charm, and a faint dizziness crept up his spine. Roy, still watching him, leaned forward, his elbows resting on his knees.

“How’s that wine treating you, Eddy? Feeling good?”

Edward wiped his forehead with the back of his hand. “Roy... I think I need to—”

But before Edward could finish his sentence, the room seemed to sway again.

Roy didn’t say anything at first. He simply leaned back in his chair, his smile widening just slightly, as though he were savoring something.

“Take it easy, Eddy,” Roy said, his voice low and almost... soothing?

The words echoed in Edward’s head like a warning, but he couldn’t focus enough to make sense of them. His limbs felt heavy, his head too light.

Slowly, with the faintest flicker of dread, he realized something was terribly wrong.

Edward tried to push himself to his feet, but his body felt unresponsive. He reached out, fumbling for the edge of the coffee table to steady himself, but it seemed to drift just out of reach.

Edward’s breath hitched in his chest.

Prompt 4: Life in prison…

In the fractured ruins of what was once the United States, a poetical tyrant named James McAuthor has risen to power. McAuthor presents himself as a visionary leader, a man of art and intellect, cloaked in the charisma of a savior. But those who dare to oppose him whisper another name in the shadows: *The Antichrist*.

Jayson Ryan, once a respected college professor turned underground activist, dared to speak out. He published a manifesto denouncing McAuthor, accusing him of using poetry and language as tools of control—subtle, hypnotic chains that bind the minds of the people. For his defiance, Jayson was imprisoned.

Now locked away in a high-security facility, Jayson is treated as a madman. The guards mock him daily, sneering as they pass his cell. They call him *""The Prophet in Chains.""* He talks to the walls, scrawls cryptic symbols into his food trays, and mutters strange phrases under his breath. To the world, he is a lunatic. But beneath the surface of his madness, a terrifying truth waits to be uncovered.

Jayson now rots in Blackridge. officially designated for the “Linguistically Compromised”—those whose speech is considered dangerous. His cell is cold and metallic, illuminated by a single buzzing light. Time is a fog. Days blur. Nights bleed.

At first, the guards only mocked him lightly.

They mimicked his old lectures in singsong voices. *“Language is a living thing,”* one would say, clutching his chest like a stage actor. *“And guess what, teach? We strangled it.”*

But as the weeks turned, the mockery turned sharp.

The guards—there’s something wrong with them. Jayson sees it in the way their eyes don’t blink enough.

they take photos. ""Just documenting the madness,"" they say.

But Jayson knows. They’re not just guards. They’re watchers, sent by McAuthor

I am Happy to play as Jayson or the prison officers 👮‍♂️👮‍♂️👮‍♂️

Prompt 5: Creepy uncle.

Your character just lost their job. Twenty-two, burned out, broke, and barely holding things together. City life chewed them up and spit them out—no savings, no safety net.

Uncle Roy (My Oc) Old-school. Keeps to himself. Lives on a patch of land where the radio barely works and the nights get *too* quiet. He’s offered a place to stay—no questions asked. Just a bed, a roof, and a chance to breathe.

The door creaked open slowly.  
There stood at the small wooden table just outside the door, slicing an apple with a hunting knife far sharper than necessary was good old uncle Roy. Each cut was even, precise—almost meditative.

It was meant to help her out while she got her life together.

She completely trashed it. Fast food everywhere, coffee spilled, makeup smeared into the seats, it literally smells like trash. She never locks it either. It sits out front of my house which is embarrassing. I took it to work last month and saw bugs in it. I loved this car when i had it and seeing it like this hurt badly, especially considering I basically gave it away to her so she could get back on track. She still doesn't work and is still living with me eating my food and hardly contributes to the daily chores.

I told her to clean it or I’d take care of it myself. She laughed and said I can't tell her how to treat her car.

So last weekend I drove it to a junkyard while she was out with her friends and scrapped it. Despite the KBB value being 3,000 they would only give me $400. That's how bad she treated this thing.

 I didn’t tell her until after she asked where her car is. I said I was tired of looking like I live with a hoarder. She freaked out and screamed about how i ruined her life. I told her its not like she needed it for work or anything and maybe her goal should be to get a job and save up for her own car.

I’m especially interested in those who’ve created something meaningful for travelers — from walking tours to authentic supra experiences.


2. Partners/investors – people who may want to support the project and/or promote their unique products for tourists (handmade crafts, rare souvenirs, niche services) through the site. I’m open to collaboration.

1lagfo1,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiction/comments/1lagfo1/the_hollow_truth_chapter1/,THE HOLLOW TRUTH CHAPTER-1,"Chapter 1: The Invitation
From the ashes of memory, something stirs.

The letter arrived on a Tuesday. No return address. The envelope was textured, handmade—old-fashioned. Ink bled slightly on the edges, as if written in haste… or with trembling hands.

Leon Varga stood at the threshold of his apartment in Kraków, staring at the envelope. His fingers were reluctant to touch it. Something about the weight—too heavy for one page—unsettled him. His ears rang faintly. A trick of the mind, surely. He told himself that twice, then picked it up.

Inside: a single photograph and a note.

> “They never left. Come see for yourself.”
—V.



The photograph was grainy, black and white. But he recognized the face immediately. Wide eyes. Pale hair. A scar just under the jawline.

Elena Weiss.
Dead. Or so they had said.

She had been fifteen when she vanished with four others in the mountain town of Dornthal, a place Leon had scraped from his memories like rot from an old wound. The town, the case, the nightmares—he thought they were long buried.

But the girl in the photo… she wasn’t fifteen. She was older now. Maybe twenty-five. The same age Leon had last been in Dornthal. The photo was new. Recent. Impossible.

His fingers trembled. His palms grew slick with sweat. His breathing grew short.

Not again. Not now.

He stumbled to the bathroom and flicked cold water on his face. The mirror blurred, and for a moment—just a moment—he thought he saw someone behind him in the reflection. A flash of white hair, a narrow face. He spun. Nothing. Just steam curling from the cracked tile.

He didn’t sleep that night.

The next morning, Leon made the call. Only one person would believe him.

Matteo Linhart, his closest friend—and a conspiracy vlogger who’d built a following debunking legends and chasing the ones he couldn’t.

> “I’m serious, Matt. It’s her. From Dornthal. Elena.”

“Leon,” Matteo said slowly, “Elena’s dead. There was a fire. Five kids gone. It was the story that launched your career. Why would anyone—”

“She’s older. It’s recent. It’s real.”



A pause. Then, Matteo whispered:

> “You sure it’s not one of your... episodes?”



Leon went quiet.

Matteo regretted it instantly.

> “Sorry. Look. I’m coming over. Show me the photo.”



When Matteo arrived, he said nothing for a full minute, holding the photo in gloved hands as if it might stain him.

> “…This isn’t doctored,” he finally said. “Where did you say this came from?”



> “I didn’t,” Leon replied.



That evening, the nightmares began.

Leon wandered a blackened corridor lined with burning doors. Children whispered from behind them, some crying, others chanting in languages he didn’t understand. A bell tolled above, warped and echoing like it was underwater.

He approached one of the doors. Scratched into the surface:

“Room 5: The Ones Who Watch.”

From within, he heard her voice:

> “Elena?!” he called.



But what answered him wasn’t a voice.

It was the sound of something breathing. Not human. Wet. Hungry.

He awoke screaming, hands around his own throat.

The next morning, Matteo was already researching.

> “You know the town’s sealed now?” he said over a mug of burnt coffee. “Landslides after the fire. Officially ‘uninhabitable.’ But there are people still living nearby. Quiet types. Not a lot of info online.”



Leon stared out the window. Fog had rolled in overnight, clinging to the glass like fingers.

> “We have to go,” he said.



Matteo hesitated.

> “Leon… whatever’s waiting there, it’s not going to be clean. You’ve worked ten years to put this behind you. Are you sure?”



Leon turned to him, eyes sunken.

> “I don’t want closure. I want the truth.”



By Friday, they were in Leon’s car heading into the Carpathian foothills. The roads grew narrow. Trees arched overhead like the spines of giants. Fog deepened with each mile.

> “Ish,” Matteo muttered. “Feels like we’re being swallowed.”



Leon remained silent, eyes locked on the road ahead.

Just outside Dornthal, they passed a crooked wooden sign half-covered in moss:

> WELCOME TO DORNTHAL – Elevation: 6,113 ft
“May you never walk alone.”



It was half-burned. Blackened at the edges.

They arrived just before dusk. The town was ghostlike—molded buildings, rusted signs, windows boarded from the inside. A single crow sat on a power line, unmoving, as if carved from coal.

And then they saw him.

An old man sitting on a bench in the square, facing the ruined school building. He was motionless, wrapped in a threadbare coat despite the heat.

Leon approached.

> “Excuse me… do you live here?”



The man didn’t respond. His eyes were wide, cataracted—but alert.

Leon tried again.

> “I’m looking for information. About Elena Weiss. The children who—”



The man lifted a trembling finger and pointed toward the school.

Then he whispered,

> “You shouldn’t have come back.”



Leon turned to look where he pointed. When he looked back—

The bench was empty.

That night, they stayed in the only building with an intact roof: the old church. No power. Just candles and sleeping bags.

Matteo rigged up cameras and audio equipment—

> “Just in case,” he said.



Leon, meanwhile, stared at the photo. The shadows around Elena’s face seemed darker now, deeper.

At midnight, the bell of the ruined school rang once.

No wind. No mechanism.

Just one, deep, echoing clang.

Leon whispered to himself,

> “They never left.”

Personally, I love herbal tea; my favorites are chamomile, lavender, rose, ginger, hibiscus, rose hips, and peppermint. I drink it every single day, not just for anxiety regulation or health benefits but for the enjoyment overall. I can’t go a day without it. Whenever I see a box of tea at the store or online (especially if it has Chinese writing or pretty flower patterns on it) I get excited. 

I was never crazy about coffee. Maybe with cream, milk and caramel but I was never obsessed with it like everyone I know is. I feel like coffee is overrated, especially here in the West where everyone is always busy or in a hurry for something. Plus, our ancestors were tea lovers, way before they were enslaved and sold to this country. In fact, most African countries consume tea way more than they consume coffee. I don’t know about where you guys live, but tea culture isn’t so big where I live (the Midwest) where of course everyone is seems to be obsessed with Starbucks or Dunkin’ coffee and just the grind in general. The Midwest is kinda boring so they need caffeine to feel alive. I wish there were more tea shops in my area. Tea culture isn’t very big in the US in general. 

So, I’m curious to know if any of you are tea lovers or enjoy drinking tea on a frequent basis or if you just prefer it over coffee. I’d be very happy if you recommend some tea blends, brands and flavors! 😊🌸",16,1749822640.0,blackgirls,6,1.0,False

Overall healthy, no known medical issues. In fairly good shape, i don’t do nearly as much cardio and walking as I use to but train with weights 4 days a week. Only diagnosed with elevated blood pressure at times and moderate anxiety. 

Let me say, i don’t know the difference between palpitations, skipped beats, and an actual irregular heartbeat. 

Mine are mainly an issue when exercising or during high stress/anxiety situations but here lately exercise has been a cause and the anxiety kicks in and makes it way worse. 

I’ve cut back my coffee from 2-3 cups a day to just 1. I don’t take any medicine or anything else. 

It’s hard to describe what it feels like, but it definitely feel like it skips a beat and just makes me super nervous i have a serious medical condition going on. 

I wore a Holter monitor for a few days and they said they saw a few extra beats but that’s about it, I wasn’t wearing it at the time of real panicky situations unfortunately. I’ve been to the ER and i calmed down by the time I got there and was on an EKG for a few hours and nothing. 

It’s like i’m entering an afib or have sporadic skipped beats and it’s not being caught by medical staff, I’m not sure what the next steps are because it’s really begun to affect my quality of life.

1lagawf,https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/1lagawf/i_dont_even_have_puppy_blues_i_just_find_it/,"I don't even have puppy blues, I just find it difficult to manage the stress with my mental health issues","Hi all. 4 month old puppy, he's an angel. (This is also an update if you remember my previous post - puppy has no issues by now apart from being a bit skittish, even the breeder was surprised how good it all turned out!)

I have no reason to complain, he only chews on his toys, sleeps when there isn't movement in the house (I'm in home office), and even the biting is super manageable. He's even almost potty trained by now too, which is baffling to me because it took my other dog months. Very smart and attentive pup. He has his small shenanigans but that's it.

  
However, I've been struggling with depression for a long time, and I feel like I can't handle the stress and constant worrying because of it. I'm now tired all the time, feel physically sick and weak, and sometimes dread the moment he wakes up, when he's never even committed any serious puppy felonies apart from successfully jumping on the bed for a few times, stealing non-toy objects from the coffee table, or doing parkour in the living room. He does have some health issues, turns out his breed doesn't do very well with the kennel cough vaccine, so sometimes he'll end up having a reverse sneezing fit, which is horrifying to watch (looks like he's choking on something), but apparently this will go away on its own in 1-2 months and we can't do much about it. Still obviosuly this adds a lot to the stress, especially when I'm home alone when he starts it.

I'm still a bit scared my other, far bigger dog will hurt him even though all he ever did was a few warning growls when the puppy got too annoying. I have no reason to be scared, I just don't know how to handle toy breeds, they're so small when they're young. Him being small probably the reason for most of my stress. Sometimes he'll go play alone in a living room with his favourite toy, I can hear the rattling sound from my study so I know I don't have to worry, but leaving him without direct, constant supervision is stressing me as well, but I can't be watching him all the time when I'm working. (Yes don't worry, I do go out every now and then to make sure he's not destroying and eating the toy.)

So I think I just want to hear it gets better. And some point he'll finally have thoughts not just vibes, when I can finally leave him without supervision. Please someone tell me there will be a time when it will be more joy than stress, because right now it's ""DROP THAT"" ""Ohnowhatheseatingagain DROP IT"" ""GET DOWN FROM THERE!"" and ""PLEASE MAKE SMART DECISIONS!"". Like he's not a landshark puppy, he's a ""look what I can do!! hoo hoo hoo haa haa haa!"" type of puppy who will definitelly break a limb at some point at this rate.

I have an ex who I was in an abusive relationship with that ended with quite a bang. He was arrested for harassment and threats with a dangerous weapon, put on probation for 5 years, and can never own a firearm again. The abuse started mentally, then financially, then physically. 

During my years with him, I did think to save a good amount of evidence of the abuse and documented a lot in personal journals. In the years since, I’ve gone to a lot of therapy, and I mean a lot, and ended up compiling that documentation into a binder. I basically scrapbooked my way through processing trauma. And that binder has been sitting in a storage unit since I moved in with my now husband.  

Well I knew that my ex ended up marrying a girl I knew from high school who was sweet and smart and very liberal. This guy was a deadbeat, misspelled a tattoo he did on himself, and wished he was at the capital on the 6th. (I swear my taste in men isn’t total trash, my husband is amazing)

But the pair never made sense to me and I just prayed that he was capable of change and didn’t do what he did to me, to her. When I found out she was pregnant with his kid I couldn’t stop worrying about her. I found out, as expected, the story she got was that I was crazy and a cheater and I made things up, and she likely didn’t even know about his arrest and conviction. I don’t know what their relationship was like behind closed doors but I knew that I’d have an endless amount of ‘what if’s’ if he had a child with her and was anything like he was with me because nobody deserves the treatment I got and no child should ever have to see that or think it’s okay. 

So, I made a copy of every single page I put in the binder and packed them up with a handwritten note offering to talk about anything if she’d like. I gave them to a mutual friend to deliver so he couldn’t intercept. About a week later, she texted me. We met for coffee and she brought the papers, pulling pages out one by one and asking for context and comparing the story he told to mine. After a bit she just sat silently and told me how sorry she was for what I went through. I was a little surprised she believed it no question, and she told me she didn’t believe any of it until the official court records and my victim impact statement. Then it was like it all clicked how real it was. 

I offered her a room or any help if she wanted to leave, but she said she was going to head home and pack a bag for her parents. It’s been a few days since and she’s staying with them until she decides her next move, but hasn’t told him the real reason behind this all yet. 

At first I had no doubt or regret about what I did. But I’ve had some people tell me that I had no business blowing up her life and I have no idea what he is like now. But I was doing what I think I would want someone to do for me? I’m not sure, AITAH? 

EDIT TO ANSWER COMMON QUESTIONS: 

- I found out about the marriage and the pregnancy through screenshots sent to me. It’s small town gossip, not me keeping tabs. 
- I waited until after she was pregnant because I had thought about doing it when I found out they were married but decided to stay out of it. When I found out she was pregnant I knew I couldn’t sleep at night if I didnt tell her. It pushed me over the edge because he had caused a miscarriage for me and that’s a pain I wouldn’t wish upon my worst enemy. 
- Yes my husband knows about the past abuse and that I did this, and fully supported me, even offered to give it to her himself 
- I currently have a restraining order on him, an incredibly protective guard dog, a security system, and a concealed carry license that I actively use. 
- The people that found out were not from me telling. At first I only told my mom, who I went to for advice, my husband obviously, and later I told 2 friends who knew every detail just so they knew. Most responses were from people I only kinda know or don’t know at all because they found out somehow through her. That’s all I know. ",34,1749822197.0,TwoHotTakes,18,0.9,False

Summary- Ever since you hired your personal assistant, life and work has been going smoothly. Almost too smoothly. You have seen massive successes in the company and got back additional free time you never had before. This even allowed you to start dating and get out more often. You owe her a lot but she’s always been a stoic oddball. She’s a little pushy but well intentioned… mostly. Recently she’s been bugging you to sit down and watch her presentation to you on an ‘important topic’ but she refuses to say more. Whenever she talks about it you feel an unnerving feeling that you shouldn’t accept and thus have been pushing it off. Until today…

Excuse me, I am here to give you today's morning briefing. How are you today.

…

I am glad to hear you are well. Today we have a busy schedule. This morning has 2 back to back virtual meetings of an hour each. Those will begin in 30 minutes, giving you time to browse your computer for messages that came in over overnight and enjoy your morning coffee. After your meetings, we have a one-on-one lunch meeting with-

…

Yes, with them. With the negotiations going so well, they are looking for one last meeting to go over the fine details with you. I hope you do not find this bothersome.

…

I can cancel the meeting if you find it unnecessary.

…

The appointment will remain then.  

… 

After your lunch meeting, you are set to return here for a visit to the staffs’ offices. Since the increased workload, your presence in the offices is required to make the staff feel they are recognized by the higher-ups. Walk around, chat with them and shake hands.

…

Once that is completed, we will have a block of free time in case the office visit goes long. To end the day, I have reserved time for my presentation. I have been telling you about for some time and found time in your schedule. It seemed as good a time as any to-

…

But as discussed, it is a time-sensitive matter, I think you would have a lot to gain from letting me tell you about it.

…

I’m sorry, but I must insist that you allow me to present on my topic.

…

As… as you request, my presentation will be removed from your schedule.

…

Yes, going forward I will not do as such without your permission. My apologies.

…

I will retrieve your coffee now, Please feel free to browse your computer for tasks at this time.

…

\[Speaker brews a cup of coffee and sets it on the desk\]

…

Here you are.

…

Of course. Enjoy. \[listener takes a sip\]

…

Are you okay? It seems you are displeased.

…

Well of course the coffee flavor seems off. I put a large amount of sedative in the coffee, it is bound to interfere with the taste.

…

I did so because of your resistance to my presentation. Due to that, I took extreme measures to make sure you listen to me. Worry not, for I have canceled all your appointments today due to sickness, as long as your response to my talk is satisfactory, I expect business as usual to resume tomorrow.

…

Sleep well. I will begin preparing my presentation.

…

\[time skip\]

…

\[listener groggily wakes up\] I am sure you are wondering why I asked you here today.

…

I am aware I didn't ask you here, rather, I forced you, but it's about the formality. You asked me to always be professional, and so I must. You are my captive audience, are you not?

…

I meant it more literally captive audience, since you are bound to that chair. You have refused me this opportunity quite often, so I had no other choice.

…

I brought you here today because I need you to finally understand my feelings. I need to show you all that I have done for you. 

…

Of course. I take care of you. I will outline your day, support your every activity. I’m the backbone of your work and life. You need me, because with me you are more. Greater.

…

\[Speaker Changes slides\] Look, here are the trend graphs from after hiring me. You will see the productivity, profits, and investor rating have all been on a steady increase. 

…

At 3 locations on the graph, you can see larger spikes. 1, at the time in when my staff initiative was implemented, reducing the number of slackers we had within our office, 2, where I initiated the opportunity to collaborate with another office on a larger project that started the merger that happened later in the year, and lastly, the rival office's collapse.

…

Oh, you assume it was internal conflict that brought down that rival office? You are correct, that is what the reports on the news said, as that is what I intended them to say. My interference wasn't that hard though. Simply airing out some the CEO’s dirty laundry was enough.

…

Of course, I was very intentional. I did things you did not request, but needed. It was all because I knew they would be helpful. I will do anything for you, shown through all this progress. I have made myself an invaluable asset to you, through any means necessary. It drove me insane that I would spend all this time after work our doing tasks and not being with you. I knew that it was all for your sake. I was working towards this day. This moment.

…

Outside of work, I know just as much. \[Speaker Changes slides\] see, here we have a picture of your favorite outfit. This includes your favorite color that fits you so well and a creative choice of texture. Every morning I find you have dressed in your favorite clothing, I make sure to compliment you. 

…

That smile in return always brightens my day. It was what first captured my heart. You did this to me. You started all of this. I just wanted to be your personal assistant but you demanded more from me with that damn smile.

…

\[Speaker Changes slides\] Next we have you eating your favorite food. It’s from the fancy restaurant downtown and you go once a quarter to celebrate another quarter of improvement. You promised yourself that you wouldn't go on a quarter that you missed your goals so I worked extra hard to guarantee you never missed that meal. You never noticed me sitting alone in the back of the restaurant as I took these pictures.

…

I’ve even learned to cook that meal myself, so you wouldn’t need to ever go there again. 

…

Of course, I would learn to cook for you. I would like to remind you that I would do anything for you. Even if it was against your will, like this presentation. I knew it was the best for you so I kidnapped you for \*your\* sake. I needed you to understand me and what I’ve done for you... You will see just how far I’m willing to go.

…

No, I will not release you. I need you to stay. I’m not done showing my presentation. I have many more slides remaining.

…

Part of me was dreading this day. This moment. I was not looking forward to your face of fear and horror, I didn’t want you to look at me like… like this. But now that it's here. I think I like the feeling of this look too. The heat of your anger makes my skin tingle. 

…

\[Speaker Changes slides\] This is your favorite show, and here you are watching it. Since I’ve gotten to know you, you've watched it 6 times, and are currently on season 2 episode 6 again as you sat down to watch it last night.

…

Yes, that is a picture through your living room window silly. It was the best angle I could get for the photo. The more difficult part was disabling your motion-sensing lights in the yard. That made it a bit challenging. I would have preferred for you to let me inside, but, beggers can’t be choosers.

…

Yes, it was me that broke them. It's always me. I’m the reason some of your items go missing. Like your hoodie that you wear most nights? Sometimes I sneak in and wear it as I huff your pillow and take it home with me for a longer session. I just need to be surrounded by you. I need to take in your scent, or my motivation will drain. All the work I do for your sake is exhausting, but I do it happily. Recharge moments like those keep me going.

…

Of course, I can get into your place. Working so closely with you allowed me the opportunity to duplicate your key. Sometimes I stare at my copy and imagine you gave it to me by choice. I realized that unless you were forced to see me my effort, I don't think that would ever be mine. That's where the idea of this presentation came from. 

…

\[Speaker Changes slides\] have I told you that I love taking candids of you? Like this sleeping picture. I make sure that no one and nothing interrupts your sleep as I watch you through the night. I mean, look how peaceful you are sleeping with no care in the world. I am responsible for that. You can only sleep like that because of me. I give you all of me. I give you all my time. All my energy. You are my world. I just would like you to return the favor. I want to belong to me.

…

No, no \*NO.\* You- You need me. Look at all I do for you. You need to recognize that I provide so love and success to you. I know that you can see that. I have all this evidence. What more do you need? I can't allow you to say no. Don’t deny me.

…

I love you. I love you more than my own life. My \*life\* is dedicated to you alone. I just need you to be mine. I molded myself into the thing you can no longer live without. 

…

Oh. I know you \*think\* that you love someone else. You show her off on your socials like she's important. But she can't be. I know because all the things she should do, she doesn't. I do those things. She should know your every like and dislike. She should know the way you like your coffee. She should know the ways she can make your work successful.  She should be invaluable to you. But she's not. I’ve seen how she is.

…

\[Speaker Changes slides\] Of course I have seen her. As much as I love to look at you when you sleep, her face is a much more unpleasant view. I-I need you to know there is only one way out of this. I don't think I can leave your side ever again. From now on, I will always be next to you, watching. Otherwise, you might try to lie and say I am ‘stalking’ or ‘abusive’ but that’s a misunderstanding. 

…

More than that, I need you to see that being next to me allows you to watch over me too. Because… I have the urge to go back to her place and take a new picture of her sleeping. One's, I’m sure you won't like nearly as much. 

…

\[speaker gets closer to the listener and puts their hand on their cheek\] Hey. Look at me. \*Look at me.\* You’ve seen how far I'll go for you. If you think I won’t physically maim someone for you, then I don’t think you are looking closely enough at the sleeping picture of your girlfriend on the screen. Nothing is off limits. You will be mine.

…

Thank you baby. I love you so much. I would have hated to hear you say no after everything I did, I’m so proud you recognized my effort. From this moment on, I will always be by your side. Always. And forever. You are mine.

1lag8bz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1lag8bz/explore_uppababy_minu_v3_travel_stroller_review/,Explore UPPAbaby Minu V3 Travel Stroller Review Is It Worth the Hype,"Testing out the UPPAbaby Minu V3 Travel Stroller certainly felt like taking a deep dive into what premium stroller design has to offer. This compact marvel manages to balance lightweight portability with an array of thoughtful features. It’s no surprise the UPPAbaby Minu V3 Travel Stroller has left me both impressed and harboring a few reservations that may or may not apply depending on individual needs.

**Compact Design and Portability Shine Bright**  
One of the product’s strongest points is undoubtedly its compact and overhead-friendly design. With dimensions designed to fit airline overhead compartments, I couldn’t help but marvel at the ease of portability during travel. This stroller weighs only 16.7 pounds, yet it doesn’t compromise sturdiness. The ability to fold and unfold it with one hand in a matter of seconds was something I quickly grew fond of—especially when multitasking with a baby in tow. The integrated carry strap is a detail you’ll thank yourself for during errands or flights. If convenience is your top priority, this stroller doesn’t disappoint.

[Ready for UPPAbaby Minu V3 Travel Stroller? See Amazon’s price.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b0dwnmxkxf/)  

**A Premium Canopy for Weather Woes**  
As someone living where the weather can be unpredictable, I appreciated the zip-out extendable canopy offering UPF 50+ weather resistance. It’s water-repellant and includes a handy peek-a-boo mesh window, which ensured that I could keep an eye on my little one while they were protected from sun, wind, or the occasional drizzle. Thoughtful features like these make every outdoor stroll pleasant while providing peace of mind.

**Seating Comfort Made Personal**  
The adjustable seating is a game-changer, particularly for growing kids. With a five-point harness system, a plush insert, and a high seat back, the stroller ensures both safety and comfort for babies of different sizes. I found the three-position footrest particularly useful for customizing the riding experience. A baby could nap comfortably in infinite recline positions while toddlers can enjoy sitting upright. This customization made long stroller walks feel less like work and more like leisure.

**Strolling with Effortless Flow**  
The smooth ride is another key feature. Front suspension in conjunction with independent rear suspension gives this stroller excellent maneuverability. Whether I navigated cracked sidewalks, uneven park paths, or even a busy mall, the stroller glided gracefully with minimal effort. Handling it one-handed while drinking coffee in the other hand revealed its light-yet-durable design truly comes into play.

**A Focus on Safety and Sustainability**  
I couldn’t help but notice how many small touches were included to ensure the safety and well-being of both the baby and the parent. Apart from the high-quality full-grain leather accents, the GREENGUARD Gold certification reassures you that this stroller uses materials designed to support healthier air quality. Small additions like the hidden Air Tracker pocket also stood out; this thoughtful detail adds an extra sense of security by keeping tabs on your stroller’s whereabouts.

**Storage Space: A Mixed Bag**  
The storage basket can hold up to 20 pounds, which helped me lug around diaper bags, snacks, and even some groceries. While the capacity is sufficient, I occasionally found accessing it slightly awkward, especially when the seat was fully reclined. This isn’t a dealbreaker, but it’s worth noting for parents constantly on the go with heavier loads.

**Key Benefits**  
- Folding and unfolding with one hand is hassle-free.  
- The stroller is impressively lightweight yet remains durable.  
- It's travel-system compatible with Mesa, Aria, Maxi-Cosi, Nuna, and Cybex car seats.  
- The adjustable five-point harness and recline position suit babies and toddlers perfectly.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Access to the storage basket becomes less convenient when fully reclined.  
- While great for urban travel, it may not be ideal for rough terrain or off-roaders.
- The premium materials drive up the cost, which might be a concern for some parents.  

**Competing Brands**  
When lining up the UPPAbaby Minu V3 Travel Stroller with others like the Babyzen YOYO2 or Bugaboo Ant, certain contrasts became apparent. All three models shine in the realm of compact strollers, but the Babyzen YOYO2 takes the spotlight for accessories and customization options, while the Bugaboo Ant edges others out with its ergonomic design for taller caregivers. The UPPAbaby Minu V3 Travel Stroller, however, excels in its folding mechanism and overall sturdiness. I also prefer the weather-resistance and extended visor compared to similar models. Budget-wise, some competing products may offer more features for a slightly lower price, but not necessarily with the same material quality UPPAbaby brings to the table.

**Price Performance**  
Thinking about whether this stroller aligns with its price tag depends on what you value. It certainly feels sturdy, luxurious, and trustworthy, and added features like a weather canopy and carry strap boosted its usability for everyday life and adventure. This is not a product for those seeking something budget-friendly but instead for those who prioritize convenience, premium materials, and sleek functionality.

My mother is engaged in a severe OCD spell.  From the minute she finishes her breakfast til night time with mood swings and chucking my belongings.  

It's unreal.  So far I face this so alone. With help from medical professionals, a diagnosis, help from family. 

I am alone.  Except for this online groups and amazingly my work.   I find respite from my home in work but sometimes my work does bring other challagnesand stress too but it is great for helping me to get respite from home.  I was even allowed to move into work for a week recently and we were all happy. 

Home, it is so stressful.  My mother is showing some amount of crazy behaviours.  Rummaging like a rat in every corner of the house.  

It is so so so hard. 

The past two weeks - my bedroom has been my place.   When I am not in work. I am in my bedroom. I will not spend more than 2/3 minutes in my mother's company.  I even plan things so I am up at about 6 am before she gets up to brush my teeth and to get coffee and maybe some breakfast. 


Basically my room is a state now and it's from depression and badly need to pick an hour or two somewhere and clean this.  I do have some plans to tidy it but putting it into action.

1lag7io,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1lag7io/interfaith_marriage_with_protestant_and/,Inter-faith marriage with Protestant and ex-Catholic and general Christian thoughts,"My wife is Protestant (Sola Scriptura) and I grew up in the Catholic Church. If I had to label myself now, I'd say agnostic. She goes to a non-denominational church and I go with her to be supportive.

Recently, we drove by an Orthodox Church and I got to thinking about the various churches/denominations in Christianity, how she practices her faith, and what I would do if I wanted to go back to Christianity. We got to discussing that and she said I was disrespectful to her.

If I were to go back, I would want to find the Truth. By that, I mean that Jesus established a Church (Matthew 16:18) and I would do by best to make an honest, genuine effort to research Christian history to determine what that Church is. Logically, it makes sense to me that apostolic succession is a requirement. If Jesus established his Church through the apostles, namely Peter, then one should look to a Church that is rooted in the apostles.

She found a church to attend by ""shopping around"" for a church. Eventually, she found one that she felt comfortable with and ""feels"" it. She has attended a Catholic Church a few times and never ""felt"" it. This doesn't make sense to me because finding a church was subjective. She is in control of her Christian faith and wanted to find a church that aligns with her rather than finding a church that aligns with the Truth of Christianity, whatever that may be.

I got to talking about early Christianity and apostolic succession with her which naturally led to the Catholic Church. She brought up the common talking points about idolatry of sculptures, worshipping people (saints, Mary) instead of God, and the Catholic Church being man-made. I wanted to challenge that because even though I am not a practicing Catholic, I felt it was disingenuous just from an integrity standpoint. If she wants to disagree, that is fine, but she should at least be honest about the Catholic faith regarding veneration, intercession, and worship aids. I stated the Catholic perspective on those things and she still thought it was worship. I said something along the lines of ""Well, you can think that but it's simply not true"". She was offended by this and felt disrespected about her faith. Perhaps I made a mistake there and should have just let it go.

I didn't reply to her comment about the Church being man-made at this point because she was upset. But, that also did not make sense to me because we go to non-denominational church that is quite literally man-made. A pastor decided to establish a church with their worship consisting of modern Christian worship songs and a homily by the pastor. Sometimes, they have symbolic bread and juice as the ""eucharist"" which is completely at odds with historical Christianity. You can even buy merchandise with the church name on them (sweatshirts, coffee mugs, etc.). I understand that it is for financial support but it doesn't help the man-made concept.

She also quoted a Bible verse about Christ being present wherever people gather. So, the Church is the figurative body of Christians no matter where they gather. I can see her point but it also ignores other Bible verses and their interpretations regarding tradition as well as historical Christianity in general, which brings me to my next point about authority.

Sola Scriptura and the Protestant practices seem very subjective. This may sound rude but I don't know how else to say it (and of course I did not say this to her). Who is she, or anyone else, to decide what the Church is other than Jesus and his apostles? Was Christianity practiced incorrectly for 1500 years before Martin Luther? In some ways, I almost think it is absurd for someone to reject historical Christianity and traditions and decide for themselves what is correct. 

Protestantism seems like a ""choose your own adventure"" way of Christianity and you can decide for yourself what is correct rather than doing what is correct. 

Anyway, I guess I don't really have a point. I just needed to write down my thoughts and learn to be more accepting of my wife's faith.

Gardai were last night questioning a millionaire over the murder of missing Annie McCarrick – after they received new information in the case. And, more than 32 years after the American student disappeared in Dublin, officers also began searching a house in the city.

Sources have told The Irish Mirror that the arrested man, who is now a respectable businessman and owns several properties with combined values of more than €1 million, has long been a suspect in the case of Ms McCarrick, who disappeared from south Dublin in March 1993.

The search is ongoing and it's hoped the dog will assist as despite extensive investigations, her body has never been found

The searches come with the first arrest in the long running probe into her disappearance – and comes two years after the case was upgraded from a missing person’s case to a full blown murder inquiry. Sources have also told us that the man, who is now in his 60s, had an infatuation with Ms McCarrick. He has been interviewed by gardai at least twice.

But that was as a witness – and now he is being questioned as a murder suspect. Officers from Irishtown Garda Station in south central Dublin – where the Annie McCarrick investigation is based – early yesterday morning sealed off a house in Clondalkin in south west Dublin that they suspect may be connected to the American woman’s murder.

Officers began using specialist search equipment at the house yesterday afternoon – but gardai were keen to stress that the current occupants of the property were not connected in any way with Ms McCarrick – or the investigation. “The current residents of this home are not connected in any way with Annie McCarrick or her disappearance,” gardai said in a statement.

The suspect, who was known to Ms McCarrick, was arrested on suspicion of murder early on Thursday morning and he was being quizzed in a Dublin Garda Station last night. Officers can hold the man for 24 hours before he must either be charged or released.

But that does not include significant periods of rest that must be offered to the suspect – which means it is likely the detention time will run out on Friday afternoon, or even the evening. Sources last night told us that gardai took the decision to arrest the suspect after a thorough review of the case that has seen dozens of people interviewed by detectives.

They said investigators were not anticipating any immediate breakthrough in the case – but remained hopeful. “This arrest is not a shot in the dark,” one source said last night. “It came about after the investigation team received new information. After evaluating that information, the decision was taken to make the arrest and carry out the search.”

We have also established that gardai have spent much of the last two years interviewing dozens of people who worked with Ms McCarrick – or knew her personally. They have been building a case against the suspect – and even went to France to interview a key associate.

Gardai announced the dramatic development in a statement early yesterday morning. The force said: ”Gardaí investigating the disappearance and murder of Annie McCarrick in March 1993 have this morning arrested a male on suspicion of her murder.

“The male aged in his 60’ is detained under the provisions of Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 at a Garda Station in Dublin. Investigating Gardaí are today commencing a search operation at a residence in Clondalkin, Dublin 22.

“Elements of that house and garden will be searched and subject of both technical and forensic examinations. The current residents of this home are not connected in any way with Annie McCarrick or her disappearance.”

The statement also said local gardai were being assisted by detectives from the Garda Cold Case Unit and National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.

The force said: “The arrest and search operation is being led by an investigation team from the DMR South Central Division, Serious Crime Unit based at Irishtown Garda Station under the direction of a Senior Investigating Officer and with the assistance of the Serious Crime Review Team, Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.

“The search is being carried out by the DMR South Central divisional search team supported by the Garda National Technical Bureau. This search operation has the support of other state and external expertise if required. An Garda Síochána has and will continue to keep the family of Annie McCarrick fully updated in relation to this investigation. They have been fully appraised of today’s developments.”

And officers also appealed for witnesses to come forward – even if they had been holding back information for decades. Gardai said: “An Garda Síochána appeal to anyone with information, no matter how small or insignificant that they might believe it to be, to contact the investigation team.

“Gardaí also appeal to anyone that may have previously come forward but who felt that they could not provide Gardaí with all of the relevant information they had in relation to this matter, to please make contact with An Garda Síochána again. With the passage of time they may now be in a position to speak further with the investigation team.

“Any information will be welcomed by the investigation team, and will be treated in the strictest confidence. The investigation team can be contacted at Irishtown Garda Station on 01 666 9600 or anyone who wishes to provide information confidentially should contact the Garda Confidential Line: 1800 666 111.”

It's understood gardai were aware of the suspect shortly after Annie was last seen in a coffee shop in the Sandymount area of south Dublin on March 26, 1993. Sources say he was able to give an account of his whereabouts around the time Annie disappeared – but that account is now under the spotlight again.

The focus of the investigation had been in Enniskerry, in rural south County Dublin, after a sighting of Ms McCarrick there on the day she disappeared – as well as one of her at Johnny Fox’s pub in Glencullen, around 5kms away. But neither of those sightings was ever confirmed and gardai now doubt she was in that area.

She was, however, caught on CCTV in a bank in the Sandymount area of central Dublin on March 26 – and that is the last confirmed sighting of her. Sources say detectives now believe the answer to her disappearance and murder lies in and around an area in south central Dublin, including Sandymount.

Best selling author Marisa Mackle, who worked in a restaurant with Ms McCarrick and never believed that she had gone to Johnny Fox’s, last night said she felt vindicated by the arrest.

She said: “I do feel vindicated, but it is a hollow vindication. I never wanted to be proven right.”

But she added: “It is a good day. But I really hope it ends in something rather than getting the family’s hopes up.”",32,1749821982.0,UnresolvedMysteries,0,0.97,False

1lag4sm,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1lag4sm/i_miss_us_but_i_dont_miss_you/,I miss us. But I don’t miss you.,"Hi. 

It would’ve been our one year anniversary if we were still together. But we are not.

It’s monsoon again and the pitter-patter of the rain brings back immense memories; so immense, that I struggle to handle them. It has been over 3 months since I last heard your voice, and a long time since we were last together. Even today, I pick up my phone and the thought of calling you crosses my mind. Even though I _know_ I won’t do it, the idea of you lingers in the background, teasing me. Staying away from you is becoming easier, but the longer I stay away, the stronger the pangs get, whenever I _do_ get them. For now, I ride the tide. And I miss us, there’s no doubt about that. But I don’t really miss _you_. You were always wrong for me, and I know that _now_. I keep the list of reasons (you were wrong) handy, on my phone, for weak moments. Off lately, I do not have to pull it up too often. 

And yet, I miss us. I miss showing you things I’ve learnt, tell you about how I finished all my shopping within an hour, or how I fixed my bike without any help. I would’ve written notes to you, or sent you poems that I liked. I would’ve showed off all the weight I’ve lost and how pumped I feel, the salads I make every day or other things I am now learning in the kitchen. How I am firming up my boundaries, and staying calm even when others around me aren’t calm. That I can now _hear_ my body when it says something and I take care of it. That I can now identify the patterns of my old self and measure my growth. I would’ve beamed with pride and would’ve wanted to keep getting better, for us. 

I would’ve annoyed you by waking up at 6 AM on weekends and making early plans, which you would’ve hated. I would’ve dragged you to off-beat movies or plays just so that you’d leave the house. I’d have made tea for me and a strong cup of coffee for you before insisting we go to the park and get a walk together. We’d get into debates on politics or some other things, make our points, and even with differences would’ve been respectful throughout. We would’ve chuckled about the religious beliefs we hold so dear, how sometimes they can fail us, and sat in silence contemplating alone, yet together. I loved that about us. The weekends would’ve felt so small and weekdays so long. I would’ve planned my vacations and leaves and holidays so we can make the most of our time together and…

Yeah, we could’ve been doing a lot of things. But instead, we broke up. You did not miss a beat and moved on to someone else because you were convinced you were running out of time already. I am choosing to stay away from you, because I love myself more than I love staying in touch with you. I am so thankful for all the mistakes you made and red flags you waved and I am extremely grateful for my friends and family and therapist who helped me spot them before it was too late. I’ve grown a lot in the last year, you know? And I didn’t even know that was possible after the horrible divorce years I had before that. Now, I feel like I am _just_ getting started on my growth. I _am_ growing. It is scary and exciting and fulfilling and…and also a little lonely and a little empty without you. I miss you, I miss us. 

I loved you very much. Very passionately. I have no regrets about loving you. You put me in touch with a beautiful side of mine. For you, I brought out the best in me and I will carry it on even though we’re not together. 

I will fall in love again. But strangely this time (and in a nice way), I am not in a hurry. I do not feel pressured—not to heal from the heartbreak and definitely not to jump into dating again. You used to say that it always hits differently when you’re on the other side of 35. But I think you’re wrong in generalising. I now believe that truly fulfilled people are happy and content, no matter what age.

I too will be happy, no matter what age or status. I have decided that for myself. Until then, if I ever miss you, I will cry and write letters on a random Reddit sub. But I will not reach out to you. May you stay happy in your oblivion.

My (28F) younger sister, ""Becca"" (24F), has been living with me for the past six months since she moved to the city for a new job. I offered her a place to stay while she got on her feet, no rent, just asked her to help with utilities and chores. Everything was fine for a bit, but then her habit of ""borrowing"" my things without asking started.


It began with clothes, then small kitchen appliances, which annoyed me, but I let it slide. I have a professional photography business on the side, and my camera gear is my livelihood. It's expensive, delicate, and I have always been extremely clear with everyone, including Becca, that my camera equipment is off-limits. Period. I have a dedicated, locked cabinet for it, and I've told her countless times not to touch it.


About a month ago, I found my backup lens, a $700 prime lens, out of its case on the coffee table. It had a minor scratch. When I confronted her, she admitted she ""just wanted to take a few pictures for Instagram"" and ""forgot"" my rule. She promised it wouldn't happen again and downplayed the scratch, saying ""it's barely noticeable."" I was furious but, stupidly, let it go after a stern lecture.


Fast forward to yesterday. I had a big shoot today and went to grab my main body camera, a $2,500 mirrorless setup, from its locked cabinet. The lock was clearly forced open, and the camera body was gone. I found it later, shoved under her bed, with a huge, deep gouge across the LCD screen and a noticeable dent on the corner of the body itself.
I confronted her, holding the damaged camera, and she just shrugged and said, ""Oh, yeah, I just borrowed it for a few selfies at a party last night. It must have gotten bumped."" Bumped? It looks like she threw it down a flight of stairs! When I blew up, demanding how she could disrespect my clear boundaries and damage something so expensive and critical to my income, she yelled back that I was ""overreacting about a little scratch"" and that I was ""acting like a crazy person over a camera."" She then had the audacity to say, ""You have insurance, right? Just file a claim! It's not a big deal!""


That was it. I told her right then and there that she needed to pack her bags and find somewhere else to stay, effective immediately. She started crying, calling me a horrible sister, and saying I was abandoning her. Now my parents are calling me, saying I'm being too harsh and that ""accidents happen"" and ""she's family.""


Am I the asshole here? Am I overreacting to kick my own sister out over this, especially when she has nowhere else to go right now? Or is she being incredibly entitled and disrespectful?

just a short story, because i think my story would be not suitable for reddit or a single thread. I have a form of ADHD, had PTSD & dissociations, so as you can imagine, i've saw some shit but i was able to get trough it and only dissociations and that special form of ADHD remained.

I never thought i had ADHD, because i abused the hell out of coffee without knowing it really..i worked ""fine""...but after ive stopped drinking 3 cans daily, because the side effects where horrible, i saw that i wasnt able to get anything done. And yes, even years after i stopped.

I got tested and was diagnosed with a special form of adhd. I'm not very hyperactive, but got a lot of other symptoms.

My brain was always looking for the next dopamine hit, always looking for more interesting things... it was a constant struggle, escpecially with important / boring tasks and concentrating on one task was very, very draining. (when it's not highly dopamine inducing)

All things have a barrier for me, let's call it the ""start the task""-barrier. With bupropion this barrier got smacked really hard and is just a shadow of its former self. Concentrating on things is really easy now.

I had a lot of dissociations too...moments where i asked myself ""are i'm even ""real""?"" and everything felt like i was watching my life unfolding like a movie. Could control everything, but it felt so distant...with bupropion i got this  ""real"" feeling back and i feel real again.

The last few days where very productive...and a bit unreal because i changed so much. It took 1 week for me to really feel the benefits of it without getting side-effects. (pressure in the head (behind my right eye), stomach cramps/gas)

May someone please help me with making it a bit darker and more gritty but not in a cliched manner? TIA!





His apartment was near the campus; it was neither large nor particularly small, but his bachelorhood was obvious in every room. The bathroom was sparsely furnished. The washstand with the narrow enamel basin was aged. In certain spots, the white paint had peeled off, and especially around the faucet, the washstand showed shabby wear. As I sat there, on the toilet lid, legs crossed, the sandals with the far too narrow footbed on the floor in front of me, I wondered if he had ever had a woman in this apartment. Because nothing remotely suggested it.
I stood up and walked barefoot to the washstand. Above it hung a mirrored cabinet. I opened it; the hinge made a lonely squeaking sound, and inside there were only a few items, and only half of those were appropriate for a bathroom. A bottle of mouthwash stood next to a toothbrush, in a glass was an old comb, and next to it was a notepad, all the pages torn out. On it lay three pencils, two of which were unusable. One had a broken lead, the other was too short. Also, there was a bottle of his aftershave, whose smell I could only tolerate in very small doses.
On the grimy shelf above the bottom of the cabinet lay a tarnished wristwatch. I remember raising my eyebrows as I looked at this tarnished slender watch because it was very feminine, yet the band was too short to fit any adult woman's wrist. No, it looked like a children's watch, and when I inspected it closer, I recognized the faded pattern of a Flick-Flack watch: a series of zig-zags, with small crooked stars and hearts scattered in the rows.I put the watch back on the shelf and closed the cabinet with a slightly disgusted deliberateness.
I looked in the mirror. Then I reached into the handbag on the windowsill and grabbed rouge and lipstick, applying everything with a relaxed sluggishness. Then I looked at myself one last time and decided not to keep him waiting any longer.
He was sitting on the sofa reading an article in some newspaper he had previously left on the coffee table. I sat down silently next to him and looked over his shoulder with feigned interest.
“Would you like something to drink?” he asked, and I smiled and looked him first in the eyes, then at the nose, then at the lips.“A coffee, maybe.”He got up and went to the kitchen without any sign that I should follow him. I stood up anyway and trotted after him. The kitchen was similarly sparsely furnished. On the countertop was a coffee machine, next to it a hook on which linen towels hung, next to that a knife block and a wooden board.
While the machine hummed, he went to the fridge:“Do you drink it with milk? Sugar?”I usually drank it with a lot of milk and three spoons of sugar:“Without anything, just black.”He nodded reverently, and when the machine had filled the white cup about halfway, he set it in front of me. Then he sat down opposite me at the kitchen table, which was flanked by two chairs. For a literary man, he had good posture; his back did not seem slumped or crooked. His hands lay flat on the table, his dark hair neatly combed, and he looked like the cliché of what he was—mysterious and, above all, at this moment, frightening. When I looked at him, I felt slightly dizzy and looked down at the coffee.
“You know, this arrangement is really not unusual.”“Yes. I know.”“You’re quite pretty, you know that?”He stood up and went to the window opposite the table. He pulled his cigarette case from the pocket of his pants and lit one with one of the matches lying on the windowsill. Then he looked at me and stared stoically at the wall.“Are you still a virgin?”The directness of his question felt like a blow to the back of my neck, and I looked back into the cup. The combination of strong coffee, cigarette smoke, and the unbearable aftershave made me feel terribly nauseous.“Yes,” I lied, assuming that was the preferred answer. But I was wrong because for a fraction of a second the expression of a certain shame and disgust flickered across his drawn face before it abruptly disappeared, and he looked at me with an interested gaze.“Tell me, what was the short story we analyzed last month again?”“Which one exactly? The one about the dying tomcat or—?”“Oh, yes, exactly.” he interrupted me as he remembered.“For Esmé—With Love and Squalor.”“Exactly. For Esmé—With Love and Squalor.”“Did you like it?”“Very much. But I already knew it.”I drank the now lukewarm coffee. It tasted disgusting, and I hid the disgust behind a dry cough.“Should I stop smoking?” he asked, a hint of concern in his voice, and I shook my head.“No, it’s fine, smoke if you want, doesn’t bother me.”He looked at me as if I were an unsolvable paradox.“I assume you like Salinger?”“In parts. I didn’t like The Catcher in the Rye. But I do like his stories about the Glass family.”“Yeah? Well, young women are usually not very receptive to Salinger. Especially not to The Catcher in the Rye.”“Mhm.”“You could tell in the lecture how many of your fellow students grimaced.”“Yeah,” I nodded and grinned, “Do you have a favorite story of his?”He looked at me and went back to the table, sat down opposite me, and kept smoking. Watching him like that pleased me much more—I was practically staring—then he took my hand in his.“For Esmé. Or A Girl I Knew. Do you have one? A favorite story, I mean.”“Teddy and Franny.”“Hm. That fits.” He laughed and squeezed my hand a little tighter, running his thumb over my ring finger. I wore a slim silver ring with a heart-shaped inset stone. He traced its outline:“You know, Salinger likes his partners younger. Many authors and academics do. I mean—” he took a drag from the cigarette and blew the smoke next to me, careful not to puff it in my face—“—I obviously can’t speak for everyone; but maybe it has something to do with innocence. Sometimes,” he seemed to be searching for the right words.“Sometimes you feel like the whole world has gone completely to hell, and everything pure, beautiful, is lost. But then you meet someone,” he squeezed my hand tighter, “who proves the opposite. And sometimes she might be younger. But spiritually she is on the same level as you.I think that’s the fascination with women like you that Salinger and I share.”“Mhm.”“On this level, Salinger and I are quite similar. He’s also a very reserved man.”We looked at each other for a brief moment, then I turned my coffee cup back and forth.“But you’re not Salinger,” I said, looking at him intently. Nervousness spread inside me, and I couldn’t suppress it.He let go of my hand and extinguished the cigarette in my cup. Then he stood up.“No. Of course, I’m not.”He took the half-full cup and placed it in the sink. His dreamy manner shifted into a slightly rapid and irritated mania.“I’ll clean up here. You can go ahead to the bedroom.”
And that’s exactly what I did.

1lafzea,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1lafzea/uncomfortable_truths_about_ruto/,Uncomfortable Truths about Ruto.,"I've seen an earlier post today criticizes boda guys for having a different opinion on the current regime. The other day some aspirant said housing levy itolewe and I just laughed.

Regardless of how you feel you should always remember that cash is king. Huyo Ruto anawafinya, anainua mama mboga na mtu wa boda or rather that's how he makes it seem to them.

That boda guy used to make 50 bob per trip. Now he makes 100 bob per trip. It takes him less trips to make 500 bob a day. Prices of petrol and goods have risen. Do you think he cares? No.

  
His wife/ aunt/sister sells sukuma. She makes 20 bob extra for the same amount of sukuma she used to cut. Yes. she also buys at a higher price. Do you think she cares? No. As long as yeye ako na 350 instead of 200 at the end of the day. 

Their son/neighbor/uncle/bro alipata gig pale kwa affordable housing. Atakuwa chairman kwa committee ya harambee ya kujenga kanisa in a few months time. When they hear you say affordable housing to go or taxes zipunguzwe. They look at you like you are from Mars. Io pesa ikitolewa, pesa ya kuwalipa itatoka wapi?

  
When Ruto/Kindiki visits their towns with empowerment. Huyo msee unampataga base kila siku will sing all day and pocket his 500 bob. That day he sleeps with a full stomach. Probably the last time he ate well was months ago. 

  
Coffee was once selling for 10 bob per kilo. Now it's selling for over 100bob per kilo in several towns. 

Milk is now well worth over sh 50 bob per litre. 

**When you hear Ruto constantly reminding people he has built them shades, markets, employed several intern teachers, made fertilizer affordable etc.. don't assume he is for a second talking to you**. He has his own audience that he is reminding mahali amewatoa and ensuring they don't forget. 

The people who usually come out en masse to vote. Those who brave huge lines. They are several and when you threaten to dip into their pockets. They shall come out in large numbers to protect their interests. Because to them.. if you only remain silent and not criticize...also known as better the devil you know.

  
Ruto has committed several wrongs. His regime is punitive. Ruthless. Inhumane. But don't for a second think that his regime is not benefitting others. 

Anyway. **Tell your favorite aspirants that issuing statements is not enough**. *Ruto is creating an illusion for the masses that historically vote*. They should be ready. Because yeye ako tayari and it won't be easy.

  
Gachagua knows this. Yes. I know you don't think he is an option. But they are people who think he is. 

  
Get your voters card and be ready to vote. ",6,1749821429.0,Kenya,10,0.8,False

At night, I have a few small cases of gear (eyepieces etc - basically like camera lenses). I'd like a table for it to sit on rather than on the ground.

I was thinking of one of the low single action tables...but I'm wondering if I should get an IGT table in case I decide to use that in the future. I've never really cooked while camping - I just bring food along. I have the BiPod stove already for coffee - so I'm set there.

is there any point in getting an IGT table if I never cook on it?

I'd rather not wind up with a ton of gear so I'm gonna pick just one for now.

So far, I’ve just tried the beans that came with the machine (De’Longhi Signature Beans), however, no matter what adjustments I do, it tastes decent but no better than my pod machine. 

I’ve set it to grinding level 3 which seems to do a nice steady creamy texture (Any lower and it starts dripping)

Any other tips on really getting that good coffee taste, or is it just likely my beans?

Also another thing I notice is the milk is too foamy, is there an adjustment I can make to make it less foamy and more-so actual liquid milk?

Audio quality is ace, and the EQ absolutely brings out the best it has to offer. Compared to my airpods pro, it’s almost ridiculous how different they sound. Using the airpods pro on a flight felt like listening to FM radio at times, but with the xm6s it was hard to resist bobbing and singing along at every opportunity. It just makes me so impressed to have a product like this that does ANC, music quality and wireless playback all so well.

Comfort-wise, unfortunately it does not sit nicely with my glasses so i can only wear for an hour tops. Without glasses, i can do two to three hours before feeling fatigued. No issues with the headband, and the slimmed-down, lightweight design plus foldable hinges are totally a win.

Admittedly, the price is not great. Just way too much to spend on a pair of disposable battery-powered product.

1lafp1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income/comments/1lafp1k/i_analyzed_hundreds_of_posts_and_comments_and/,I analyzed hundreds of posts and comments and found out the reason people are not making any money in this sub,"I created a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income/s/hreTNq0D4J) about my journey on reaching 650$ per week (Take the time to go through that post first as its important to understand this post) and it got alot of attention, becoming in the top 15 posts of all time and I, as one would expect got a ton of dms, some of which were very frustrating to go through so I just stopped at one point. I decided then to take a stepback and analyse the posts and comments in this sub and I found a negative recurring theme, here are some of the findings:

1- People just want to copy what others do for an easy win. 

Maybe the most common question that I got was about the specifics of what niches im in, and I get how some want to know what kind of niches are popular and working. But this isn't the way you're supposed to do that, its not like a good reason to open a new account is because you saw a random reddit post talking about this niche. What worked for me a year and a half a go might not work for anyone today.

2- People expect to be spoonfed all the information. 

This is probably the most important point, the amount of people that just came in and said ""Teach me your ways"" or ""Tell me step by step what you did"" is concerning. In reality, no one can really teach how to make money online, not even courses, as everyone has his own pathway and a course that is for everyone probably works on none (Mentorships work though as they're personalized)

3- People dont invest in themselves.

The market now is very competitive for anyone to just learn things on their own. Most of the people here want to get rich by next month but wont learn the skills they need to. As if they'll magically teach thenselved how to edit videos and go viral with them as soon as they start, without putting the time or money into learning it. They'd rather just spend 5$ per day on coffee instead of buying that 40$ editing course that'll set them up to generate thousands later on. Get your priorities straight


4- People focus on too many money making ways.

They probably just see a way someone made 30k a month and immediatly get drawn to it and considering how many people here post just to get you to press their link or their product (we'll probably even see a few comment on this post) they're definetly not making any progress. The truth is all of the ways people make money in are legit, the problem is that you never committed to one long enough to actually see results. Dont just follow what a random redditor did to get 30k a month. Instead, make a list of the ways people make money and write pros and cons of each and settle on one and go all in on it. It will probably work with time



5- They expect to make 10k by next week

Success and making money is a gradual process, no one would reach 10k$ per month until they surpass 1k per month and 5k per month first. You start by making money first and then scaling to more money",18,1749820643.0,passive_income,1,0.94,False

Olivia “Liv” Parker left the high-stakes world of Boston homicide for a quieter life in Harbor Point—a charming coastal town where the scones are sweet, the coffee is strong, and the cats have a mind of their own.

But Liv’s dream of opening Whisker’s Bakery & Cat Café crumbles on opening morning when the town’s most powerful (and most disliked) real estate mogul drops dead on her kitchen floor—with one of her signature scones in hand.

Now the prime suspect in a small-town murder, Liv must dust off her detective instincts to clear her name. With the help of her snarky best friend, a suspiciously clever Maine Coon named Sherlock, and a cast of quirky townsfolk—each with secrets and motives—Liv races to solve the case before her second chance at happiness disappears for good.

As the clues pile up and another life is threatened, Liv discovers that danger, like a stray cat, always finds a way back in.

1laffnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1laffnm/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

So budget that i bought a used - like new Delonghi ecp 3630 on amazon for $95. When i get a better grinder i do plan on upgrading the basket/filter. My wife doesn't like coffee of any variety so this was what I could justify for the time being.  Anyway they sent me an ecp 3420 instead, but looking at the box and unit it seems to have never once been used or even fully unpacked.

The seller is offering to either return the one they sent and send me the right one or a $20 refund because that's what the price delta is. Part of me wants to get the right one because of the metal housing and the visual appeal. The other part of me knows they're basically the same machine apart from housing and steam wand and knows that the replacement might not be in as good of shape. I could also use the 20 for some essentials like a wdt tool and proper tamp.

So anyway, i'm very indecisive and thought i'd ask the sub, is it worth the hassle and risk of a less than perfect unit or should i just keep the one i have, pocket the 20 and make some mediocre espresso?",1,1749819809.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

## What is EverixEdge?

EverixEdge is an **automated trading platform** that uses advanced algorithms and AI-driven tools to help users trade across various financial markets. Think of it like a digital co-pilot for trading—an assistant that handles the heavy lifting of technical analysis and market trends.

It’s mainly geared toward **cryptocurrency trading**, but also supports other assets like forex, stocks, and commodities. Unlike traditional brokerages that require hours of learning, EverixEdge simplifies the process by offering automation and smart trading tools that even beginners can use.

## Who Created EverixEdge?

While the exact team behind EverixEdge keeps a relatively low profile (which is pretty common for platforms in this niche), it’s believed to have been developed by a group of **financial tech experts** and software engineers with prior experience in building algorithmic trading systems.

Now, this anonymity might raise some eyebrows, but it’s not unusual in the world of automated trading platforms—**Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge** were the same way. The important thing is that the platform functions smoothly and shows no signs of being a scam operation.

## How Does EverixEdge Work?

EverixEdge uses **real-time data analysis** combined with machine learning algorithms to identify potentially profitable trading opportunities. When you fund your account, the platform either trades automatically on your behalf or gives you signals to execute trades manually.

Here’s a simplified version of what happens behind the scenes:

- The algorithm scans the market 24/7
- It identifies trends and price patterns
- Based on your settings, it either sends alerts or places trades automatically
- You monitor results, adjust settings, or go full auto

This setup is especially helpful for people who don’t want to stare at charts all day. You can still have a job, live your life, and let the system do its thing in the background.

## EverixEdge Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real—no platform is perfect. Here’s the good and the not-so-great:

**Pros:**
- **Easy to use**, even for beginners
- **Automated trading** saves time and reduces emotional decision-making
- **Demo account** lets you try before you commit real money
- **Supports multiple asset types**, not just crypto
- **AI-powered insights** help with smarter trades

**Cons:**
- **Not regulated**, which might be a dealbreaker for some
- **Minimum deposit of $250** might be a bit steep for total newbies
- **Limited transparency** about the creators
- **Advanced customization** may be limited compared to professional platforms

## What Devices Can be Used to Access EverixEdge?

One thing I really liked is how **device-flexible** EverixEdge is. It’s fully web-based, so you don’t need to download anything, and it’s optimized for:

- **Desktops and laptops** (Windows, macOS)
- **Smartphones and tablets** (iOS and Android)
- Works well on **standard browsers** like Chrome, Safari, and Firefox

You can literally check your trades during your lunch break or while waiting in line for coffee. That’s a win in my book.

Hes really smart and went to a fancy private school while I went to regular public school. Usually this isnt an issue but lately hes been correcting the way I say certain words and its starting to embarrass me.

It started small like when I said ""supposably"" instead of ""supposedly"" he would gently correct me. I didnt mind at first because I actually appreciated learning the right way to say things. But now hes doing it constantly and always in front of other people.

Last week we were at dinner with his friends and I was telling a story about something that happened at work. I used the word ""irregardless"" and Marcus immediately interrupted me to say ""regardless, babe, irregardless isnt a real word."" Everyone at the table got quiet and I felt stupid for the rest of the night.

Then at a party this weekend I was talking to some girl about a documentary I watched and I pronounced ""nuclear"" like ""nucular."" Marcus came over and said ""its nuclear not nucular"" in this condescending tone. The girl looked uncomfortable and changed the subject.

Yesterday we were at the grocery store and I asked where the ""expresso"" was. Marcus said loudly ""its espresso not expresso"" and the barista at the coffee counter gave me this pitying look. I was so embarrassed I just walked away.

When I told Marcus later that his corrections are embarrassing me he said hes just trying to help me sound more educated. He said people judge you based on how you speak and that he doesnt want others to think less of me. He also said if he doesnt correct me who will.

I pointed out that he only corrects me in public never when were alone. He said he doesnt always notice my mistakes when its just us talking casually. But it feels like hes purposely showing off how smart he is by making me look dumb in front of people.

Now Im second guessing everything I say around his friends and family. I even looked up pronunciation guides online because Im paranoid about saying something wrong. Marcus says Im being too sensitive and that constructive criticism should be welcomed in relationships.

1laf9a3,https://i.redd.it/mbux3u9mzo6f1.jpeg,$ATYR – Forget the Panic: A Real-World Guide to Risk Management in Volatile Times,"Hey folks,

Yesterday, conflict broke out in the Middle East Israel launched a coordinated military operation against Iran. Iran has already responded, and we’re likely to see tit-for-tat actions over the coming days. The situation is evolving rapidly, headlines are shifting by the hour, and while the US has distanced itself from direct involvement, it is providing support in the background. There’s a real risk of escalation or a drawn-out confrontation, and right now, the market is still digesting what this means. No one can say with confidence how far it will go.

If you’re an investor—especially in a sector as volatile as biotech—events like this naturally create worry, not just about profit targets and portfolio drawdowns, but about the entire basis for making decisions when the world suddenly feels unstable. Geopolitical shocks are exactly the kind of moment where most retail investors find themselves either paralysed or acting on emotion, mainly because information is so asymmetric and headlines are overwhelming. It’s a textbook “what on earth is happening?” kind of moment.

But for me, this is also an opportunity. If you’ve read my work before, you’ll know I’m never here for hype or panic. I’m interested in method—practical frameworks that help us stay grounded and make rational decisions when things get turbulent. Risk management is more than a buzzword; it’s something I’ve used and refined in real institutional contexts. I’ve built risk management solutions, coached teams, and worked hands-on in organisational settings—particularly during major disruptions like the pandemic, where I was deeply involved in global supply chain risk. So I feel genuinely well equipped to support the community here and to share thinking that goes beyond theory—grounded in practical, real-world application.

*Just for absolute clarity: I am not interested in discussing the politics of this conflict, nor will I entertain any political debate in the comments. That is not what this post is about, and there are other subreddits for those conversations. What follows is purely about an approach to risk management, and a way of thinking through volatility as an investor or operator.*

So in this post, I want to take you through the step-by-step risk approach I use in these moments. I’ll use ATYR as a case study, but this process is universal—you can apply it to any position you care about. My aim is to show you how to move from guesswork and stress to structured thinking and informed decision-making, even when profit targets are on the line.

This is another in-depth research piece, one that I’ve thought very deeply about over the last day and overnight. I don’t get paid for any of my research, my analysis, or the support I’m providing to this community. If you find value in what I’m doing and want to help keep this going, you can show your support by [buying me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/biobingo). It genuinely helps me continue the work, and it supports my ongoing research. You know I try to be as regular as possible, and I’m doing this for the community—to give you a framework for thinking and decision-making. I’d really appreciate your support.

If you’re tired of guessing or reacting blindly when the world goes sideways, this post is for you. Let’s get into it.

## A. Setting the Stage: Why Risk Thinking Matters in Volatile Times

If you’ve been watching the news, scrolling through market updates, or even just glancing at your brokerage app in the last 24 hours, you’ll know the feeling I’m talking about—a sense of uncertainty, of *“what’s going on and how is this going to impact my portfolio, my shares, my investments?”* When the headlines suddenly turn to geopolitical conflict, the flow of information quickly becomes chaotic and asymmetric. There are more questions than answers, and much of the noise you’ll encounter—online or in the media—is pure reaction: emotion-driven, rarely anchored in any real process.

This is exactly the kind of environment where investors tend to make their worst decisions. You see it in the whipsaw price moves, in the panic selling, and in the sudden surges into “safe haven” assets, often at precisely the wrong time. The root of this behaviour is simple: humans are wired to react to uncertainty and perceived threat with action, whether or not it’s rational. Most people don’t have a framework to fall back on, so when the headlines turn ugly and the screens start flashing red, they default to emotion or to whatever narrative is loudest in the moment.

But the truth is, you **don’t have to operate this way**. One of the most important advantages you can give yourself—especially as a retail investor—is learning how to pause, zoom out, and impose structure on your thinking. It’s not about pretending you know what’s coming next; it’s about giving yourself a method for sorting signal from noise, and for understanding the mechanics of risk, rather than being swept up by the mood of the crowd.

That’s really what I want to offer in this post. Most retail investors don’t get access to the frameworks or mental models that professionals use to navigate uncertainty. The gap isn’t just about data or resources; it’s about approach. By laying out the exact process I use—and, frankly, the same one used by institutions and risk committees everywhere—I want to bridge that gap. I want to show you that there is a way to bring discipline and perspective to even the wildest market environments. If you can learn to think this way, not only do you avoid the worst pitfalls of reaction and emotion, but you also put yourself in a position to make genuinely better decisions over time, regardless of what the headlines throw at you.

So before we get into the framework itself, just know this: clarity is possible, even in the mess. If you’re feeling lost, you’re not alone—but you’re also not powerless. This post is about reclaiming some of that power, and turning volatility from something to be feared into something that can be managed—and even, sometimes, leveraged.

---

## B. Step-by-Step Risk Framework

In this section, I want to walk you through the actual process I use to analyse risk—step by step, from the highest-level context all the way down to what’s actionable for an investor or a company. We’ll approach this from first principles, as if you were looking at ATYR or any business from the outside and asking: *“Given what’s just happened in the world, what’s the smartest, most structured way to assess what really matters for the stock, and what doesn’t?”*

The situation we’re dealing with right now is the sudden eruption of military conflict in the Middle East, with Israel’s strikes on Iran and the possibility of escalation. This isn’t just another headline; it’s the kind of global event that creates ripples across markets and entire sectors. The challenge for any investor—or company—is to move past the initial shock, take stock of the risks from the top down, and work methodically through what matters, where the real vulnerabilities are, and what can be done in response.

This is about starting from the very beginning, zooming out before we zoom in. We’ll use ATYR as our anchor point, but the method applies to any company or portfolio. At each stage, I’ll map the thinking process: from identifying the main categories of risk, to narrowing in on those relevant to geopolitical conflict, to translating those into specific risks and actions you can actually take.

---

### Step 1: Define High-Level Risk Categories

The first step is all about zooming out and scanning the full landscape of potential risk. In any business or investment context, this means laying out a set of broad categories that capture where things could go wrong—regardless of what’s happening in the world today. These aren’t specific to the current conflict, but they’re the scaffolding that ensures nothing is missed.

**Typical high-level risk categories include:**
- Strategic Risk
- Operational Risk
- Financial Risk
- Market Risk
- Credit Risk
- Liquidity Risk
- Regulatory & Compliance Risk
- Legal Risk
- Reputational Risk
- Cybersecurity & Data Risk
- Technology Risk
- Human Capital (People) Risk
- Supply Chain Risk
- Environmental Risk
- Political & Geopolitical Risk
- Macroeconomic Risk
- Product/Service Risk
- Intellectual Property Risk
- M&A/Integration Risk
- Catastrophic/Force Majeure Risk

For ATYR, most of these are always relevant—clinical-stage biotechs routinely face operational, regulatory, financial, and market risks. But when a geopolitical event erupts, **“Political & Geopolitical Risk”** quickly moves front and centre. The whole point of this top-down approach is to see the entire risk terrain first, and only then begin to home in.

---

### Step 2: Break Down the Relevant Category

With the high-level categories mapped, the next step is to break down the one that’s most pertinent in the current moment—in this case, **“Political & Geopolitical Risk.”** This means asking: within that big bucket, what are the different forms it can take? Here, it makes sense to separate *political risk* (domestic events, policy shifts, elections, regulatory moves within a single country) from *geopolitical risk* (cross-border tensions, conflicts, trade wars, sanctions, global alliances).

Given what’s happening now, we zero in on *geopolitical risk*—and within that, we can further break it down into sub-themes:
- Trade tensions and tariffs
- Sanctions and embargoes
- Armed conflict and war
- Diplomatic relations and alliances
- Political instability in key markets
- Nationalism and protectionism
- Transnational regulatory shifts
- Terrorism and cross-border crime
- Resource and energy security
- Cyber warfare and espionage

For ATYR, the live issue is **“Armed conflict and war”**—specifically, the outbreak of hostilities between Israel and Iran, and the possible knock-on effects for global markets, supply chains, and investor psychology.

---

### Step 3: Contextualise for the Scenario

Now we take the big-picture category and make it real. What exactly is happening, and how does it connect to the company in question? In this case, Israel has launched significant military strikes against Iran, Iran is retaliating, and there’s the risk of escalation or prolonged conflict. Markets are reacting in real time, and global investors are scrambling to figure out what it all means.

For ATYR, a US-based, clinical-stage biotech with no direct operational footprint in the Middle East, the key is to ask:

- **How exposed is the company, directly or indirectly, to this event?**
- **Which of the broader risk categories could plausibly be activated by this scenario?**
- **What transmission mechanisms—like supply chain, investor sentiment, or capital flows—might actually matter?**

Contextualising the scenario ensures we don’t just react to headlines, but instead link the real-world event to the specific areas where it might impact business fundamentals or the share price. In ATYR’s case, the most likely channels are not physical or operational, but financial and psychological: volatility in the markets, sector-wide sell-offs, changes in risk appetite, and possible knock-on effects through global funding or supply.

---

### Step 4: Identify Impact Vectors

Once you’ve contextualised the scenario, the next move is to map out the *impact vectors*—the major channels through which this specific event could affect the company or sector. These are the “routes” by which a geopolitical shock can travel from headlines into real financial consequences for ATYR.

Think of these impact vectors as both the “transmission lines” for risk and the levers by which market stress or disruption actually hits the business. It’s not enough to say “geopolitical risk is elevated”; the goal here is to articulate *how* and *where* those risks can actually show up in the business model or share price. A robust impact vector analysis isn’t just about listing possibilities, but prioritising those with genuine reach to ATYR’s operational, financial, or valuation profile. This step turns big abstract fears into a manageable set of concrete exposures.

For armed conflict in the Middle East, the most relevant impact vectors for a US-listed biotech like ATYR are:

1. **Investor Sentiment and Risk Appetite**  
   Heightened geopolitical tension often prompts investors to rotate out of riskier assets—like small- and mid-cap biotech—toward perceived safe havens. This manifests as sell-offs, reduced liquidity, and wider bid-ask spreads, regardless of company fundamentals. These moves are often mechanical and can be amplified by passive fund flows or ETF rebalancing.

2. **Direct Market Impacts**  
   Major market events—particularly those involving global security—can cause broad market drawdowns, leading to price declines across entire sectors. Even companies with no operational exposure can be pulled down in a correlated move, simply because risk appetite collapses and correlations spike across asset classes.

3. **Energy and Commodity Price Shocks**  
   Armed conflict in the Middle East often leads to spikes in oil and energy prices. For biotech, higher logistics, lab, or manufacturing costs may follow, which, for cash-burning development-stage companies, can squeeze financial runways and raise the cost of future fundraising. These impacts are often indirect but can build over time, affecting operating leverage and capital planning.

4. **Supply Chain Disruption**  
   Though less direct for a US-based biotech, global shipping, air freight, or access to raw materials may be affected—especially if the conflict disrupts key global supply routes or triggers insurance and logistics costs to spike. Supply chain pain can take longer to filter through but has the potential to derail clinical trial timelines or increase operating costs unexpectedly.

Other possible vectors—cybersecurity risk, regulatory shifts, or reputational impact—are far less likely for ATYR in this scenario, but could be more material for companies with operations or personnel in affected regions.

*This step is about discipline: listing out these vectors and being specific about what’s plausible for your company, given its business model and current environment. The better you map this, the more focused and confident you’ll be in your downstream risk assessment.*

---

### Step 5: Rank and Filter Impact Vectors

With the main vectors identified, the next step is to **rank them by materiality**: which are most likely to hit ATYR, and which are less relevant? This is where you cut through the noise and focus on what actually moves the needle.

For ATYR in this context, the ranking looks like this:

| Rank | Impact Vector                   | Materiality      | Notes                                                         |
|------|---------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Investor Sentiment & Risk       | High             | Most immediate; volatility, sector outflows, sentiment-driven |
| 2    | Direct Market Impacts           | High             | Correlated market sell-off even if company not directly exposed|
| 3    | Energy/Commodity Price Shocks   | Moderate         | Could affect cost structure and burn rate if escalation persists|
| 4    | Supply Chain Disruption         | Low–Moderate     | Unlikely unless escalation disrupts global transport/logistics |
| 5    | Others (Cyber, Reputational)    | Minimal          | Not likely to be material for ATYR in this scenario           |

The point of this ranking is to ensure your attention is on the channels with real, actionable risk. For ATYR, sentiment and market mechanics dominate; operational or reputational risks are less immediate.

---

### Step 6: Drill Down into Specific Risks

Now, for each high- and moderate-priority vector, you drill down into the specific, concrete risks that could play out—those scenarios that can actually be observed, measured, or monitored.

This is where abstraction gives way to the reality of market microstructure, business process, and investor psychology. A well-executed drill-down doesn’t just list “what could go wrong”—it describes, in practical terms, the sequence of events or market behaviours you might actually see. It’s not enough to say “energy costs may rise”; you want to specify *how* that filters down to cash burn, trial operations, or the need to raise capital.

**For Investor Sentiment & Risk Appetite:**
- Large-scale sector ETF outflows triggering mechanical selling in ATYR.  
  *Here, passive vehicles like XBI or IBB experience outflows as investors de-risk, which in turn forces selling of underlying constituents—including ATYR—even if there’s no company-specific news.*
- Surge in volatility indices (e.g. VIX) prompting de-risking by quant or macro funds.  
  *Many funds run systematic volatility or value-at-risk models; when volatility spikes, they’re compelled to cut exposure to riskier names, hitting the likes of ATYR hard.*
- Loss of liquidity in the biotech sector, leading to sharper price moves on low volume.  
  *As liquidity providers and market makers widen spreads or step back, small caps see exaggerated swings.*

**For Direct Market Impacts:**
- S&P 500 or Nasdaq sell-off on escalation news, pulling down high-beta stocks like ATYR regardless of fundamentals.  
  *This is classic “correlation goes to one” behaviour during macro shocks.*
- Temporary suspension of trading in small caps if panic spreads.  
  *Rare, but circuit breakers or market halts have been triggered before in high-stress periods.*
- General increase in bid-ask spreads, deterring institutional buying and worsening volatility.  
  *Reduced liquidity begets more volatility, reinforcing the cycle.*

**For Energy and Commodity Price Shocks:**
- Oil price spikes drive up logistics and lab costs for CROs and CMOs serving ATYR.  
  *These are often passed through in contract renewals or vendor pricing, tightening already slim margins for pre-commercial biotechs.*
- Inflation in supplier pricing shortens runway and increases future funding needs.  
  *If costs increase while the company is not yet generating revenue, the effective “burn rate” goes up—meaning the window before needing to raise more capital shortens.*
- Transport or raw material bottlenecks from global shipping route disruptions.  
  *Delays in receiving key reagents or shipping samples can slow trial timelines.*

**For Supply Chain Disruption (Low–Moderate):**
- Delays in clinical trial logistics due to global airspace rerouting.  
  *International clinical sites or labs may see shipping times and costs spike, risking protocol delays.*
- Difficulty sourcing reagents or consumables if supply chains get tangled.  
  *Not usually front-page news, but small disruptions can snowball if unaddressed.*

*This step is best done collaboratively, with input from finance, operations, investor relations, and sometimes external advisors, to ensure no blind spots remain.*

### Step 7: Rate Each Specific Risk

With your list of specific risks, you now **rate each one** for both likelihood and consequence, to create a risk matrix. The aim is to separate “background noise” from real threats, and to identify what requires active monitoring, mitigation, or contingency planning.

A simple example using the most material risks for ATYR:

| Specific Risk                                     | Likelihood | Consequence | Materiality (Combined) | Notes                                                |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Sector ETF outflows/mechanical selling            | Likely     | High        | High                   | Can trigger sudden, sharp price declines             |
| Broad market sell-off (risk-off event)            | Possible   | High        | High                   | Correlated drawdown even if not fundamentally hit    |
| Volatility-driven quant fund de-risking           | Possible   | Moderate    | Moderate               | Amplifies downside moves, especially on thin volume  |
| Oil/logistics cost spikes raise cash burn         | Possible   | Moderate    | Moderate               | Indirect, more severe if escalation persists         |
| Supplier cost inflation shortens funding runway   | Possible   | Moderate    | Moderate               | Needs monitoring, can affect future capital raising  |
| Global shipping/air freight disruption delays trials | Unlikely  | Low         | Low                    | Only material if escalation is severe and sustained  |

The matrix focuses attention on what actually requires monitoring, mitigation, or communication to stakeholders. It’s easy to get overwhelmed by the theoretical “list of everything that could go wrong,” but the risk matrix brings structure and prioritisation. For most ATYR holders, the high and moderate risks are those that can impact share price or funding runway within weeks or months, not theoretical long-tail possibilities. By having a clear matrix, you know exactly where to watch, what to manage, and which scenarios justify proactive planning versus routine monitoring. This also enables clear, rational communication to boards, investors, or the broader market—helping everyone stay focused on what matters, even when uncertainty is at its peak.

---

### Step 8: Identify Controls and Mitigations (Company & Investor)

Now that you’ve identified, ranked, and rated the specific risks, the next question is: *what can actually be done about them?* In classic risk management, this is where you map out both the controls already in place (existing mitigations) and potential additional responses. Controls fall into two buckets: those within the company’s reach, and those available to investors themselves.

**For the company (ATYR):**
- **Financial Discipline:**  
  Ensuring a strong cash position and prudent burn rate. A longer cash runway means less exposure to shocks in capital markets or rising costs. Regular scenario planning and updated forecasting become critical in volatile times.
- **Operational Flexibility:**  
  Diversifying key suppliers, building in redundancy for logistics, and maintaining close dialogue with CROs and CMOs to detect cost or delay risks early.
- **Proactive Investor Communications:**  
  Keeping the market informed, providing timely updates on exposure (or lack thereof) to the conflict, clarifying cash position and strategic priorities, and addressing uncertainty directly in earnings calls or investor letters.
- **Cost Controls:**  
  Reviewing vendor contracts and renegotiating where possible to lock in rates or minimise pass-through cost increases.
- **Trial Prioritisation:**  
  Focusing resources on value-driving milestones or trials that are most robust to disruption, and pausing or delaying less critical projects if risk escalates.

**For the investor:**
- **Portfolio Diversification:**  
  Avoiding overexposure to a single sector, stock, or risk vector. Allocating a portion of the portfolio to defensive assets, cash, or sectors less correlated with biotech.
- **Position Sizing and Liquidity Discipline:**  
  Scaling back position size if volatility or liquidity risk rises, and ensuring orders are not placed into thin markets where price swings can be amplified.
- **Stop-losses and Rebalancing:**  
  Implementing exit points or reviewing allocation targets as risk events evolve, while avoiding mechanical selling in moments of peak panic.
- **Hedging (where possible):**  
  Using sector ETFs, options, or other instruments to reduce downside exposure to broad market or sector moves.
- **Monitoring Real-Time Indicators:**  
  Watching for signals (ETF outflows, VIX spikes, sector liquidity, funding conditions) that may warrant action or increased scrutiny.
- **Maintaining a Catalyst Calendar:**  
  Knowing when critical readouts or capital needs are approaching, to avoid forced decision-making under duress.

*The essence here is agency: even in a world of uncertainty, both companies and investors have real tools to reduce, avoid, or transfer risk. Not all risks can be controlled, but being explicit about which ones can—and cannot—be managed keeps decisions grounded and reduces the odds of emotional overreaction.*

---

### Step 9: Consider Duration and Recovery

Not all risks are created equal when it comes to time. Some—like investor sentiment shocks—can hit hard and fast but fade within days or weeks. Others, like a sustained increase in cost structure or a prolonged sector-wide funding freeze, can last months or even years.

In the real world, the impact of an event like sudden armed conflict is felt most acutely in the short term—especially for day traders or anyone with a short holding period. You can almost guarantee higher volatility, rapid price swings, and shifts in liquidity. For those operating with a longer-term lens, these acute impacts often diminish in significance with time; it’s not unusual for high-quality names or entire sectors to snap back once initial panic subsides.

**Key considerations for ATYR:**

- **Short-Term vs Long-Term Effects:**  
  In the short run (the next days or weeks), the main impacts are likely to be sentiment-driven volatility, correlated market moves, and possible “risk-off” outflows from biotech. These typically present as sharp, sometimes irrational price drops.  
  Over the longer term (months, not days), the focus shifts to whether costs have structurally risen, if the capital-raising environment has truly tightened, or if the company faces real operational disruption. Historically, most external shocks fade if the core thesis is unchanged.

- **Catalyst Proximity:**  
  For ATYR specifically, we’re sitting here on 13 June with the major clinical readout (the next major catalyst) about three months away. This timing matters. If the company is well-funded and can reach that catalyst without needing to raise new capital, most short-term volatility will be just that—noise. The nearer the catalyst, the more any “macro” volatility is likely to be overridden by company-specific news and data.

- **Sector Recovery Patterns:**  
  Historically, biotech as a sector has been extremely sensitive to macro shocks and risk-off events—but also prone to dramatic rebounds when the macro fear passes. In some cases, entire drawdowns have reversed in a matter of weeks, especially if the sector is approaching major catalyst windows (like broad Phase 3 readout cycles or FDA decision periods). This pattern is even more pronounced for companies that are not fundamentally impaired and can weather the storm with cash in hand.

So, if you’re holding for the short term or trading actively, expect to feel the volatility most. If you’re holding through to the catalyst, and the company’s funding is secure, you’re often better positioned to ride out the noise and potentially benefit from the recovery when the clouds clear.

---

### Step 10: Monitor, Reassess, and Communicate

Risk management is not a set-and-forget exercise. The final step is to set up ongoing monitoring of key indicators, reassess the risk map as events develop, and communicate proactively—with boards, with staff, and for public companies, with the market.

**For ATYR and investors, this means:**
- **Establishing Key Risk Indicators (KRIs):**  
  These could include sector ETF flows, biotech index volatility, major moves in oil prices, or vendor warnings about supply chain disruptions.
- **Regular Reassessment:**  
  Formal review of the risk matrix and controls—weekly or as events unfold—to capture new information and recalibrate priorities.
- **Scenario Planning and Contingency Review:**  
  Running “what if” drills and ensuring that both company and investor plans can adapt if the situation escalates, stabilises, or morphs in unexpected ways.
- **Proactive and Transparent Communication:**  
  For the company: sharing updates, acknowledging uncertainty, and clarifying how risks are being monitored and managed.  
  For the investor: documenting decision rationales, updating personal or group investment theses, and being honest about what’s known and what isn’t.

This step closes the loop—transforming the framework from a static list into a living, breathing process. In reality, risk management isn’t about eliminating uncertainty altogether. It’s about narrowing the information gap, giving you an edge over the crowd, and equipping you with the tools to adapt. The institutions are thinking in frameworks like this; they’re not panicking or guessing how a headline will hit their portfolio—they’re working a process. My aim is to hand you that same playbook: to move you from worry and “what ifs” to real agency. With this kind of structure, you’re far harder to knock off balance. You have a foundation for action, not just reaction—real certainty in a world that doesn’t offer much.

---

## C. Beyond the Process: Managing Your Psychology

Even the most robust risk framework means little if it isn’t anchored in emotional discipline. One of the most overlooked but genuinely critical factors in navigating volatility is the *state of your own psychology*. You can have the best information, a carefully built process, and clear controls in place, but if your decision-making is driven by fear, FOMO, or a relentless focus on short-term price swings, you’re still at the mercy of the market.

Emotional discipline starts with recognising that uncertainty and discomfort are inevitable—especially during periods like this. Markets are designed to test conviction. When the headlines are chaotic and every tick feels consequential, most people’s instincts are to react—to do something—even when inaction is actually the rational response. The danger is slipping into reactive decision-making: selling at the bottom, buying at the top, or abandoning a well-founded plan because of a bad week or two.

What separates professionals from the crowd isn’t some secret information, but a structured approach to managing their own psychology. Here are some techniques that actually work:

- **Checklists:**  
  Write down, in advance, the specific criteria that will trigger changes to your position. Checklists act as a brake on impulsive decisions and ensure you’re following a rational plan, not just reacting to noise.
- **Journalling:**  
  Keep a log of your reasoning, decisions, and emotional state. Looking back over these notes after the fact can be incredibly grounding—it helps you spot patterns in your own thinking, and avoid making the same mistake twice.
- **Pre-commitment to Strategy:**  
  Decide in advance what you will do in certain scenarios—how you’ll respond to a sharp drawdown, a sudden rally, or a sector rotation. Make these decisions when you’re calm, not in the heat of the moment.

A major part of psychological resilience is the ability to *zoom out*. Markets are fractal: on a five-minute chart, everything feels urgent; on a six-month or one-year view, many short-term panics are barely visible. Whenever you feel the urge to act on emotion, force yourself to step back—literally and figuratively. Revisit your process. Ask whether the event at hand genuinely changes the thesis, or just introduces temporary noise.

The real advantage of a framework like the one we’ve just built is that it gives you *something to hold onto* when others are losing their heads. It’s the difference between being tossed around by every headline and having a map in uncertain territory. That mental structure is, in itself, a powerful psychological tool—one that not only makes you a better investor, but a steadier presence in any aspect of life that involves risk, uncertainty, and decision-making under pressure.

## D. Key Takeaways & Summary

Let me be absolutely clear about my intent with this post: I’m not here to alarm anyone, nor am I suggesting that anyone should be particularly worried by what’s unfolding. If anything, I see this as a real-world learning moment—a chance to get beyond the noise, zoom out, and use the current environment as an opportunity to build a better decision-making toolkit. Maybe I’m being conservative or even a touch risk-averse here, but my aim is not to worry you. Rather, it’s to offer a structure for thinking so that you’re not just guessing the next move, but approaching uncertainty with purpose.

The value of this framework is not just in mapping out risks, but in creating a process you can trust—especially when uncertainty is highest. The key insights are straightforward: start wide, don’t let headlines hijack your attention, and move methodically from broad risk categories to the few things that actually matter for your holdings. Rank what’s material, drill into scenarios, and put your focus where you have influence. Get specific about what is likely to be short-lived and what could actually linger, and always stay flexible enough to adapt as the facts on the ground evolve.

In my view, perspective and process are your best tools in these environments. Instead of lurching from one headline or tweet to the next, you have a discipline that makes you much harder to knock off balance. Whether things are calm or chaotic, you now have a way to communicate risk—to yourself, to others, to the wider investment community—that’s grounded and actionable. You move from reacting in the moment to making decisions anchored in evidence and process.

Ultimately, this is about agency—regaining control in a market that so often feels out of your hands. With a robust framework, you don’t have to guess. You can approach every risk with a method that institutions use daily, giving yourself a genuine edge—one that most retail investors never get close to.

She says shes just stopping by to visit but then stays for hours while the kids run around and trash my place.

I live alone and my house is set up for adults not children. I dont have any toys or kid friendly snacks and I definitely dont have child proof anything. But Jenny acts like my house is some kind of playground for her kids.

Last weekend she showed up around noon and said she was in the neighborhood. The kids immediately started touching everything and climbing on my furniture. Her youngest son found my art supplies and started drawing on my coffee table with permanent markers. When I freaked out Jenny said it was just a table and that kids will be kids.

Her middle daughter went into my bedroom without asking and started going through my jewelry box. She broke a necklace that my grandmother gave me and Jenny just said accidents happen. Her oldest son kept jumping on my couch even after I asked him to stop multiple times.

The worst part is that Jenny never helps clean up the mess. When they finally left my house looked like a tornado hit it. There were crumbs everywhere, toys scattered around that they brought in from the car, and sticky fingerprints all over my walls and windows.

I told Jenny she needs to call before coming over and that if she brings the kids they need to behave better. She said Im being uptight and that family should always be welcome. She also said her kids are just being normal children and that I dont understand because I dont have kids of my own.

Yesterday Jenny showed up again with all three kids and when I told her it wasnt a good time she got offended. She said I was being selfish and that aunts are supposed to love spending time with their nieces and nephews. Now shes telling our parents that Im rejecting her children.

My mom thinks I should be more patient since kids are naturally messy and energetic. But I feel like Jenny is taking advantage of me and treating my house like free daycare.

1laf7tw,https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1laf7tw/on_occult_consumerism/,On Occult Consumerism,"Money has long accompanied magick, but consumerism is not the same thing as charging for crafted items, services, or teaching. 

I don’t see every shop as “consumerism” and this may not be directed at you.  

I am amazed at some people who don’t think consumerism is a problem in today’s occult community, and who wouldn’t distinguish between consumerism versus taking money. 

Maybe they are too used to the capitalist and consumerist oceans we swim in to notice it. The older generation might notice more. 

Magick is like music. A musician who dedicates themself to the art, and takes pay for performances, is likely to be a good musician. Someone who tries to learn music to get a side hustle and has money as their main goal, is unlikely to be a maestro. 

To me, this is consumerism:

* sending the message that buying things (especially factory made things) will make you a better practitioner, or that you need things with the witchy aesthetic. Most of the kitschy altars we see on social media today would have been unthinkable in ancient times, and are still inaccessible to much of the world today, but are seen by some newbies as a requirement. Yes there are some items (like specialty materia) that can help for some things, but that’s different than just clutter. 

* Prioritizing appearance over substance for clickbait to monetise occult videos. (Expensive makeup jobs, fancy setups, etc) There is nothing wrong with a nice appearance, but it shouldn’t be the main draw. It says something that today’s image of a witch is a hot young woman  dressed in goth fashion (as opposed to the old wrinkly wise woman). 

* An unending series of beginners’ classes for $50 a pop, rather than sustained deeper education. (Shallowness sells)

* Creating need where there is none. (Do I need a surprise subscription box?) especially when it is environmentally harmful. 

* Creating unuseful things to make money. (Including books which are mostly vacuous). 

* Arguing that consumerism is bad for the elite but not the struggling masses, who need to make extra money through side hustles. These people seem to forget that we’re all in the same boat and they’re trying to make money off of people who are struggling too. 

* Fronting someone with a tip jar link or bill for what you thought was friendly advice or a casual chat.  

* Having to pay a fee for discussions (eg Patreon) that in the past would have been held free and in person (at homes, coffee shops, etc). Anyone and everyone seems to have a Patreon these days. Unless the Patreon is genuinely to cover fees, such as to keep a podcast running. 

* some people seem to have mixed up “creating community” with “making money off of people”. 

Having these things if you know and accept what they are is not a problem. 

The problem is when the laity start to confuse them with occult practice itself or see them as essentials or ideals. 

Of course there are worse things such as intentionally marketing to people who are homeless or mentally ill - but I’ll leave that for now. 

Some problems with consumerism:

* it stunts people’s growth by keeping them in the consumerist cycle and focusing on the material 

* It lowers quality. Producing 10 low quality books in 10 years will make you more money than producing 1 quality book in 10 years. People will pay more for what is new and, frankly, what is easy. 

* Concerns over the environment, labor abuse, and so forth. (Even if you’re making the things yourself, you’re probably buying materials, machines, etc)

* You can buy piano lessons but you can’t buy yourself mastery of piano. And you certainly can’t learn piano by watching TikTok. 

Again, I would like to distinguish between money as a tool of fair exchange, versus consumerism and capitalism. I think this is an important discussion to have. 

In the time of the PGM, there was money and charlatanry, but the type of rampant consumerism we have today is new, and some of it really took off only after the advent of social media. 

I think this a very important issue in our time and is definitely worth discussing.

We’re due to have our baby this month, the due date changed a few different times due to me being high risk and we ultimately set a mental date for the beginning of this month (June 6th) since they wanted to induce me to make sure there wasn’t any issues. He told her that but also made sure to exaggerate that it’s not 100% set in stone yet. I guess she ignored that last part and bought a plane ticket anyway for that date & decided not to tell anyone until the middle of the night before. 

So lo and behold, I ended up finally getting an official induction date scheduled for 6/18 and this last almost week and a half has been absolute torture. 

All this woman does is smoke legal weed all day long, ask for my partner get her wraps from a gas station that is practically in our backyard, sit and talk loudly on the phone at all hours of the day, takes more naps than me at 38 weeks pregnant, and makes a tsunami of a mess in our kitchen that I or my partner have to clean after she’s done and…cuts open her blunts with our butter knife’s often times leaving them bent and how that happens is beyond me. 

She lets the trash get so full that stuff starts falling out but doesn’t think to take it out (she walks past the cans when she goes outside to smoke) and when she does cook - she leaves crumbs or bags and boxes of whatever lying around & dishes piled in the sink. It’s been less than TWO weeks & I can’t take it anymore…

I spent almost 45 minutes last night around 11pm cleaning up a coffee stain on the counter, wiping up splattered food in the sink & on the stove, & the whole silverware drawer practically emptied in sink & washing food crusted dishes while she snored away in the next room. 

And this morning, she has completely avoided me and not said anything to me. I’m perplexed, I’m frustrated, but yet somehow I feel like I’m being an asshole because I want her to meet her 7th grand baby but GOD go stay in a hotel or at least be cleaner.

I want to share something personal — a game I started building completely solo, using only **Blueprints in Unreal Engine 5**. No C++, no team, no studio. Just me, a lot of coffee, and a dream to create something peaceful and heartfelt.

That game is called **City Garden Harvest** — a cozy first-person farming sim where you turn your futuristic apartment into a lush indoor garden. You grow plants, craft eco-products, upgrade your home, and just *slow down* for a bit.

And the best part?

🐱 Meet **Bimbus**, your cat. He’s not just part of the decor — he’s your cozy companion.  
You can **carry him around**, he **sleeps next to you**, and when you **sit down to read**, he quietly **joins you and purrs**. It’s subtle, but genuinely comforting — like a little hug at the end of a tough day.

🛠️ I built the foundation of the game in UE5 using nothing but Blueprints. After about six months of solo development, **all my closest friends joined in** — and together we created a beautiful playable demo. We improved the visuals, reworked the UX, and made something we’re truly proud of.

If you love calm, cozy games — or if you just want to support indie devs working from the heart — it would mean a lot if you’d **wishlist City Garden Harvest on Steam**. It’s a huge help for visibility and support.

Hey, so me (F22) and my bf (M25) moved in together last September and since then things have started going down south.  
We’ve been together for almost 3 years now and personality wise, he’s the most caring, loving and sensitive guy I’ve ever been with. He’s super intelligent, always respectful in every situation and (bare minimum ik) never ever oversteps any of my boundaries. 
He always smoked a lot of weed but I never saw it as an issue for our relationship because he always had his shit together and wasn’t one of those stoner guys that just rot away (or so I thought). 
We usually get along super well but in February he started working on his bachelors in Computer Science and has been super stressed about that. He barely leaves the house besides when he needs to get groceries, other than that he goes out MAYBE once every 3 weeks at best. He works from home too so I never have any alone time in our apartment. 
Every time we speak he’s either too stressed to listen properly, the conversation ends super quickly because he doesn’t have the time or he talks about being stressed and feeling like shit. Even though he’s at home all the time, he barely does any chores so the apartment looks like shit most the time with all his dirty plates and snack packaging and ashtrays.
We initially set some rules before moving in together which included to go one a date once a week, even if it’s just going for coffee. That happened maybe 5 times since September and other than that we aren’t doing much either. The only time we spend together is when we’re cooking and eating but other than that there’s basically no interaction going on. 
I used to try and get him out of the house and motivate him but he gets super defensive and even pissed at me so a month ago I kinda just stopped caring and started going on longer weekend trips to get away from the negativity. 

Every time I try and talk to him about it he always tells me how he cannot do anything about the situation because he needs to put in the work and cannot take any time off. it’s not even excuses, I do believe that he truly feels that he cannot leave the house but the fact that he doesn’t see that his behavior isn’t normal worries me. 
With him there’s always some sort of existential crisis going on and every time he says it’s gonna be different after but there’s always something else keeping him from truly living his life, leaving the house, spending time with me or going on vacation with me. (We never went on a vacation besides visiting friends in other cities) Now it’s his degree, before it was winter, before that it was moving. After his degree it’s probably gonna be finding a job. 
I know he needs to seek professional help because he’s obviously stuck in a deep cycle of fear and depression and he cannot access that because he literally smokes 10 joints per day. (and yes, I did tell him that) 
I feel like he won’t change because he isn’t even seeing what damage this is doing to me aswell and how frustrated I’m becoming with all of this. 
We’re barely intimate with each other because tbh I don’t even feel like it when there’s no interaction going on outside the apartment. 
I’m starting to lose attraction for him and I’m also starting to think about breaking up or at least moving out again and trying to fix the relationship while not living together anymore because this is obviously not working like we had intended. 
I have many issues too that would require support from him (my mom’s dying from als, and other struggles) and he hasn’t been there for me properly in so long. 
I have been telling him that i miss him, that I wish we’d hang out more and do stuff together but like I said, he always gets defensive when I mention it. We even got in a fight about me asking if he wants to go on vacation in late summer because he got so pissed off on that question. I’m too young to be stuck in a loveless marriage situation and  need a partner who’s by my side when going dancing, exploring or on trips and he’s not been that for me for a long time. I said I’d wait until he’s done with his degree until having a serious talk but I don’t think I can wait anymore because I can feel myself slipping away from him and even entertaining the idea of dating other people. 
Of course this was all from a rather negative POV, there’s still some nice moments together and he means so much to me but it’s just getting worse and worse. 
I honestly don’t know what to do anymore, I feel alone in my relationship and im strongly considering leaving him. 

Does anyone have experience with situations like this and can give me some proper advice besides telling me how stupid I was for moving in with him? ",0,1749818897.0,relationships,6,0.43,False

Porsha gets to keep the home! Well, kinda. Let me explain…

Simon has 50% equity in his home as a result of Simon owning this property prior to the marriage as we all know. Porsha has until 2027 to decide whether she wants to remain living there or sell it. If she does stay there, she’ll have to buy Simon out. In the meantime, Simon is legally responsible for any expenses related to the property, like the mortgage. 

It’s being speculated that Simon will file an appeal, which he has 30 days to do so. Simon also still has a pending defamation lawsuit filed against Porsha .

I moved around a lot when I was younger, so ive lost touch with my childhood friends. On top of that I have a tendency to become very distant, which also doesnt help. And in these past couple of years I havent been able to make any new friends, sometimes I feel like im too picky, since i dont usually like my co workers for some reason or another. I spend everyday alone with no one to connect to. 

I used to remember a long time ago, the only time I really felt any attention was for my birthday when I used to get a lot of messages, now I only get phone calls from family. 

Now im 31 and working in retail. I decided to start college late in life, and even then its not out of passion or love, but for the money. I have good grades and hopefully in two years ill have my bachelors, but in the meantime, I have barely enough money to cover my expenses

So I ordered Primus Bpc 157 drops to possibly speed up healing. However I had an awful reaction to it. I had heart palpitations, fast heart rate and couldn't sleep at all. It was really bad and disturbing, my stomach also seemed affected in a bad way, I felt like I couldn't even breath. This happened about 2 hours after taking 6 drops, (recommended dose for my weight). I managed to sleep for about an hour, but during that hour I had the most disturbing nightmares. I understood the dream as my unconscious telling me this thing is bad for me and it's breaking havoc in my body. It's possible I'm more sensitive than most ppl. I'm also an athlete. I notice that the biohacking community noone speaks about remembering their dreams or getting important information through dreams, which is something I found baffling.
For me dreams are essential, I remember what I dream every single night and get crucial, very critical information and instructions on how to solve situations from my dreams. I ve been known to react to sinthetic things, so I normally avoid tbose things, even supplements, I try to get everything from natural sources. But I made an exception because I suffered a serious injury and I'm wamting to speed up healing. The reaction I experienced it's terrible !!! 
I don't want to feel like that ever again, plus my body doesn't like this compound.
I'm going to try to return it. But what do you think ? 
I was looking online and there are very few side effects like this reported, although it says it's a possibility. 
I also have a headache from taking bpc 157, I never get a headache.
My body feels upset, riled up and on high alert, and it's not mental, it's just how upset my body is at this compound.
But again I might be more sensitive than most, I mean I ve met ppl that don't dream, or don't never remember their dreams, and I dnt know how they cope or live, those same ppl seem unaffected by things that certainly affect me, 
I even saw Sim Lard biohacker saying he took bpc 157 before going to bed and in the morning. How crazy. He does seem a little bit robotic, but he also said Primus bpc 157 is pure. What do you think ppl ? It's bpc 157 officially poisonous for some ppl? I'm never doing it again. 
If anything, I know it will slow my healing, specially from the way it had my nervous system on edge the whole night and even now, 
I'm looking forward to completely eliminate it from my system asap. Btw I'm a very slow metaboliser, very, and I can't metabolize caffeine at all, one cup of coffee give me panic attacks for 3 days. That bad is how I metabolize coffee, I heard in the biohacking world, how you metabolize caffeine determines your reaction to a lot of things, but I've never seen anything related to what happens when you cant metabolize caffeine at all, meaning you are allergic to coffee and to most caffeinated products. I can only tolerate a little bit of green tea and only because green tea has a natural chemical that cancels caffeine in the body (I forgat it's name). Thoughts?",1,1749818001.0,bpc_157,0,1.0,False

Mid-morning sunlight streams through the windows. The place is a disaster zone. There are papers half-sorted on the kitchen table. A half-assembled neuro-interface is glowing softly in the corner by the coffee machine. The rest of the room is a tangled pile of laundry threatening to become sentient.

Veronica storms through the living room, one sock on, hair wild, muttering under her breath. She can’t find her wallet and she is getting frantic.


Veronica, as she’s digging under couch cushions: “How can a neuroscientist with four degrees lose her wallet in her own tiny ass apartment? This is injustice.”

Spark watches her from the hallway, tail wagging slowly, as if unsure whether this is playtime or a genuine emergency.

Veronica opens the fridge and then the freezer: “I once left my keys in here. It’s possible, Spark. Brain fog is real.”

Spark tilts his head and gives a small woof.

Veronica checks under Spark’s dog bed: “Don’t give me that look. You’ve stashed socks in stranger places.”

Spark suddenly perks up, trots over to her, and begins sniffing at her jacket hanging on a chair. He nudges it. Paw. Nose. Nudge again.

Veronica: “What? Is this a game now?”

Spark snorts, tugs at the jacket’s pocket then sits proudly with a thump.

Veronica reaches into her pocket): “Oh my god. No. No. No.”

She pulls out the wallet.

Veronica turns to Spark, embarrassed and giggling with hysteria: “It was in my pocket. The whole time. You… little genius.”

Spark grins, tongue hanging out: “Woof.”

Veronica flops back on the couch, covering her face. She is going back and forth between laughter and groans.

Veronica (muffled): “I fight mind-controlling villains and build brainwave-stabilizing technology and I still can’t function without you.”

Spark climbs up next to her, plops down with a satisfied huff. She rubs his ears.

Ever wondered why your gut seems to throw tantrums right when your period begins? One day it’s bloat, the next it’s constipation, and suddenly it’s diarrhea without warning. Welcome to the world of hormonal chaos—where your gut and cycle are way more connected than you think!

At **Ace Wellness**, we believe in decoding these body cues and helping you feel your best through every phase of your cycle. Let’s dive into why this happens and what you can do to care for your gut during menstruation.

# 🌪️ Hormones Disrupt Digestion

Estrogen and progesterone don’t just affect your mood or skin—they directly impact your digestive system too.

* **Bloating:** Common before your period due to water retention and slower digestion.
* **Constipation:** Progesterone slows things down in your gut.
* **Diarrhea:** When prostaglandins (chemicals that help your uterus contract) go overboard, they can also speed up your bowel movements.

The result? Gut drama that feels like a rollercoaster during early period days.

# 💧 Hydration = Relief

Whether you’re dealing with loose motions or uncomfortable cramps, water is your best friend.

* Staying hydrated **soothes gut inflammation**
* Aids in **smooth digestion**
* Helps relieve **muscle cramping** and prevents bloating

**Pro Tip:** Add a pinch of Himalayan pink salt and lemon to your water for better electrolyte balance.

# 🍲 Eat Easy-on-the-Gut Foods

This is not the time to test your tolerance for fried or processed food. Instead, go gentle.

* **Opt for:** Warm, soft foods like khichdi, ripe bananas, steamed veggies, clear soups
* **Avoid:** Oily snacks, excess ghee, sugar-loaded desserts, and raw veggies

Your gut will thank you for serving it a break from hard-to-digest foods.

# 🧘 Gentle Movement Helps

While curling up in bed sounds tempting, moving your body can work wonders for your gut and cramps.

* Light yoga or a 20-minute walk can:
   * Stimulate digestion
   * Ease bloating
   * Calm menstrual cramps
   * Improve mood

Gentle movement is healing. Go slow, but go steady.

# 🚫 Avoid Gut Irritants

Your cravings might push you toward caffeine and sugar, but your gut might not be on the same page.

* Reduce or avoid:
   * **Coffee and tea in excess**
   * **Spicy food**
   * **Dairy** (if you’re sensitive)
   * **Refined sugar**

These can spike inflammation and worsen gut symptoms during your period.

# 🌿 What We Recommend at Ace Wellness

At Ace Wellness, we offer personalized yoga sessions, gut-health consultations, and hormone-balancing therapies that help you manage period-related symptoms naturally. Our goal is to help you feel aligned, balanced, and pain-free with your own body.

**Book your online or offline wellness consultation today and start syncing with your cycle—gently, naturally, powerfully.**

**Final Thoughts:**  
Your gut and hormones are *besties with drama*, but that doesn’t mean you have to suffer. Small shifts in your routine—hydration, food, movement, and mindfulness—can ease gut symptoms significantly during your period.

# Or: What They Don't Teach You at Harvard Business School (Because They're Too Busy Counting Their Trust Funds)

Let me tell you something about fundraising that nobody wants to admit: it's mostly bullsh\*t. Not the raising money part – that's real enough. I'm talking about all the fairy tales they tell you about how it works.

You know what I love about fundraising advice? It's written by people who've never had to explain why their last three months of runway just evaporated faster than water on hot asphalt. These are the same geniuses who tell you to ""just network"" and ""leverage your relationships."" Oh, leverage my relationships? Why didn't I think of that? Let me just call up my college roommate who happens to run a $500M fund. Oh wait – I went to state school and my roommate sells insurance.

# The Farming vs. Hunting Delusion

Everyone talks about farming, not hunting. ""Build relationships,"" they say. ""Play the long game."" You know what farming really means when you've got three months of cash left? It means you're growing vegetables while your house burns down.

But here's the radical truth nobody wants to face: most LPs are about as busy as a one-legged cat in a sandbox. They're busy being busy. They've got more meetings about meetings than actual meetings. They've got committees to form committees. They've turned saying ""no"" into an art form that would make Michelangelo weep.

And the Tier 1 funds? They don't farm. They don't even hunt. Money just shows up at their door like pizza delivery. ""Oh, you're Sequoia? Here's $2 billion. Do you take Venmo?""

# Bootstrap Until Your Boots Have No Straps Left

Here's what they should teach in business school: bootstrap until your fingernails bleed. Not because it's noble or character-building, but because fundraising will consume your soul like a slot machine in Vegas consumes your retirement fund. There are many examples of successful startups that never raised money, like Mailchimp and Spanks.

Fundraising takes longer than a government infrastructure project and costs more in opportunity than a Vegas wedding. You think you'll raise money in three months? Congratulations, you'll be lucky if you get a ""maybe"" in six months and a ""we'll circle back"" in nine.

And it never – and I mean NEVER – goes according to plan. It's either worse than a root canal performed by a blindfolded chiropractor, or it's better than winning the lottery while getting struck by lightning. There's no middle ground. It's either feast or famine, and mostly it's famine with a side of existential dread.

# The Trump Test: A Thought Experiment in Desperation

Here's a little thought experiment I call the Trump Test. When things are going well, when the money's flowing like champagne at a tech IPO party, you can be picky. ""Oh, this investor doesn't align with our values."" ""Their portfolio doesn't synergize with our mission."" Synergize – there's a word that means absolutely nothing but sounds important.

But when you're down to ramen noodles and the electricity bill is doing interpretive dance on your kitchen table, suddenly any investor looks good. Even Donald Trump. Hell, especially Donald Trump – at least he's predictable in his unpredictability.

# The Real Test: Shovels or Shoveling?

But here's the radical truth that separates the real investors from the tourist-class venture capitalists: what happens when things go sideways? And they will go sideways. Murphy's Law isn't just a suggestion in startups – it's the founding principle.

When your brilliant plan meets reality and reality wins by knockout in the first round, that's when you find out who your investors really are. Do they throw you under the bus faster than a politician abandons campaign promises? Or do they grab a shovel and start digging you out of the hole?

Most investors are like fair-weather friends – they're great for the good times and mysteriously busy during the bad times. They'll take credit for your successes and develop amnesia about your failures. ""Oh, that company? I barely knew them. I think I met the founder once at a coffee shop.""

But the good ones? The ones worth having? They show up when the sh\*t hits the fan. They don't just write checks – they roll up their sleeves. They make calls. They open doors. They problem-solve instead of problem-avoid.

# The Bottom Line (And It's Usually Red)

So here's my advice for all you emerging fund managers and pre-revenue startups out there: stop believing the fairy tales. Fundraising is hard, it takes forever, and most people will say no. The LPs are busy being busy, and unless you went to the right schools and know the right people, you're playing a rigged game.

Bootstrap as long as humanly possible. When you do raise money, find investors who'll stick around when the going gets tough. Because it will get tough. That's not pessimism – that's physics.

And remember: in the end, the only metric that matters is whether you're still standing when the dust settles. Everything else is just noise.

1laenjr,https://internationalreal.estate/,"Selling Without Paying 6%? Here's a Smarter, Modern Approach That Works (Especially Near the $1M Mark)","You're not alone - with home prices crossing $1M in many markets, that 6% commission can easily translate to $50K+. And while traditional agents bring value, it's completely fair to question whether that value scales proportionately with the price.

The good news? You *can* sell smarter - and many homeowners are already doing it successfully using a modern, hybrid approach. Here's a step-by-step playbook based on what’s working today:

**1. Use Flat-Fee MLS to Gain Visibility**  
A flat-fee MLS service gets your listing on Zillow, Realtor, and the MLS itself - giving you the exposure without the full listing agent fee. These typically cost $300–$500.

**2. Hire a Real Estate Attorney (Not a Full-Service Agent)**  
For $1,000-$2,000, you can retain a real estate attorney to handle contracts, disclosures, and negotiations. In high-stakes markets, this gives you peace of mind without bloated commissions.

**3. Invest in Professional Photos + Listing Copy**  
Don’t skip this. $200-$400 for great photos and staging advice can make a *huge* difference in both price and speed of sale.

**4. Use GRAI for Pricing, Strategy, and Buyer Behavior Insights**  
This is where most FSBO sellers fall short - pricing. [GRAI Real Estate AI Advisor](https://internationalreal.estate/) (internationalreal.estate) is an AI real estate advisor that helps you nail the price, test listing strategies ($999K vs $1.025M?), and even simulate buyer responses based on local market psychology.

You can ask it:

* “What’s the best pricing strategy to attract multiple offers for a $1M home in \[your zip\]?”
* “How much below $1M should I list to trigger a bidding war?”

It's not a listing site. It's an advisor. And it costs less than a coffee per month.

**5. Use E-Sign Tools + Digital Disclosures**  
Tools like DocuSign, HelloSign, or even free platforms help you manage offers and counteroffers seamlessly - no need for manual paperwork or agent dependency.

**6. Be Ready to Pay a Buyer’s Agent (Optional)**  
If you're not in an ultra-hot market, offering 2–2.5% to a buyer’s agent can still be worth it to keep traffic flowing. You’re still saving \~3–4% overall.

This DIY+AI approach won’t work for everyone - if your home needs complex marketing or local nuance, an agent might still make sense. But if you’re organized, willing to learn, and care about maximizing returns, this route gives you control *and* serious savings.",1,1749817667.0,realestate_and_ai,1,1.0,False

The problem? I was spending more time managing the timer than actually working. Manual pauses, restarting timers, interruptions that kill your flow... sound familiar?

# Meet Presto - the timer that finally ""gets"" how you work

# Features that make the difference

* **Smart Pause** \- Automatically detects when you step away from your computer and pauses the timer. No more ruined sessions because you forgot to stop before grabbing coffee.
* **Auto Start** \- Timers start themselves following your patterns. One less thing to think about.
* **Continuous Mode** \- Let your timers run over the limit when you're in the zone. Why interrupt when you're on a roll?

The interface is intentionally minimal - everything you need at your fingertips, no distracting bells and whistles.

# Analytics and team collaboration

I've integrated daily and weekly stats with real-time charts. It's fascinating to see how your productivity patterns change over time.

The most exciting part is the team monitoring feature I'm developing - planning to keep it free for small teams (up to 5-6 people) with a small contribution for larger teams, just to cover servers and development.

# Open source and performance

The project is [open source](https://github.com/murdercode/presto), written in Rust with Tauri. I wanted something fast and lightweight that doesn't hog system resources.

Still in active development but already usable. If you're curious or have feedback, I'm all ears!

We’re really at our wits’ end and unsure what to do next, so any advice would be appreciated.

We hired a plasterer for a job and agreed on a start date of 2 June. We paid him a 10% deposit upfront. Before starting, he messaged asking for an extra £500 for materials. We paid it.

Then he delayed the job by a full week, saying he’d now start on 9 June. The night before (8 June), he messaged again asking for another £500, saying he couldn’t pay the delivery guy as he had no money. Reluctantly, we paid that too — we just wanted the work to start.

	•	Tuesday: no show.
	•	Wednesday: turned up for half a day.
	•	Thursday & Friday: no show again.

The only consistent presence has been a young lad he’s left here, who’s doing some basic prep work — no plastering has even started. We’ve been very kind to the lad, offered him tea, coffee, even lent him our personal steamer because they turned up completely unprepared.

Yesterday, we asked the lad whether they’d be working the weekend to catch up, and he said he didn’t know. Apparently he phoned the plasterer after that.

This morning (Friday), at 7am, the plasterer calls my husband and says we are “the worst customers he’s ever had” — just for asking a reasonable question. My husband, being very non-confrontational, asked when the work will be done. The plasterer said he’ll come on Monday — but at this point, we honestly don’t trust him to turn up.

We’ve now paid around 40% of the total quote, and we’ve had no plastering work done at all.

We’re not aggressive people. We’ve been respectful, paid every time he’s asked (perhaps too trusting), and tried to accommodate delays — and now we’re being insulted and ghosted.

Where do we stand legally? Can we cancel the job and try to get our money back? We have WhatsApp messages as proof of the money he asked for and what was agreed. We’re feeling very stuck and don’t want to lose any more money or time.

Seems like it keeps being extended over and over. Maybe people don’t want to spend over $1,000 on an espresso machine from a company that A) currently doesn’t sell an espresso grinder that matches it in quality and B) follows the quality control issues and app failings of Aiden Precision Coffee Maker?

This isn’t meant to be a dunk on Fellow, I have an Aiden and have had zero issues and have loved it. But at the same time, it really doesn’t seem like this product should’ve been released currently at the price point that it was built for.

Fellow should’ve built an espresso grinder on the quality level and price similar to Ode. It’s way simpler of a product and allows more resources to focus on improving Aiden. Then following up on the grinder with a cheaper Fellow Espresso Machine ($900 or less). If you want to release the Espresso Series 1 later on, that’s fine.

Still I decided to check and see if she was out on my way to work and here she is again. I saw at least one person and he said he sees her out a lot and doesn't think she has a family. Someone else said no she's someone's pet that's why she stays in the area. 

I'm torn, she's super friendly and if she's someone's cat I'd hate to steal her. Conversely she looks as if she could give birth any day.

1. OPENING SHOT
Rows of gray cubicles. A clock ticks to 8:59 AM. Employees shuffle in with coffee.

2. CONFERENCE ROOM – 9:00 AM

BRIANNA stands at the head of a long table. TREVOR fiddles with a projector remote. KATE sips coffee. MARK leans back in his chair. LINDA sits at the far end, notebook open.

BRIANNA (clapping hands)
Alright team, let’s get started. Big quarter ahead—sales are up, but production’s lagging. Trevor, status?

TREVOR (clicks remote; slide reads “GO PAPER OR GO HOME”)
Thanks, Bri. We’ve pushed the “Go Paper” campaign; social-media impressions are up 12%, but physical orders haven’t caught up.

BRIANNA
Good on the buzz. Kate, any word on staffing?

KATE (deadpan)
We hired three seasonal temps. One thought fax machines were extinct. The other two… still on orientation.

MARCUS (smirking)
Orientation’s been running since February.

LINDA (raising hand timidly)
Actually, I think they’re just really enthusiastic about learning.

BRIANNA (encouraging)
That’s the spirit! Linda, how’s your first week?

LINDA (bright)
I’ve organized the archives, updated our LinkedIn, and—oh—I may have accidentally ordered 500 boxes of “ultra-white” instead of standard.

TREVOR (aghast)
500 boxes?! That’s—uh—creative budgeting.

KATE
Well, at least we’ll look dazzling while drowning in inventory.

Forklifts maneuver around towering shelves. MARK stands beside LINDA, surveying boxes stamped “ULTRA-WHITE.”

MARK
You know, if you mix “ultra-white” with “ivory” you might summon a paper-mageddon.

LINDA

BRIANNA paces.

BRIANNA
Okay, team—Plan B. Marcus, you’ll spearhead an eco-friendly campaign. Trevor, draft a “Paper-Power” newsletter. Kate, prepare a mini-workshop on machine handling for the temps. Linda, maybe just… don’t order any more paper this week.

LINDA (sheepish)
Got it.

BRIANNA (smiles)
Great! Meeting adjourned. Let’s make Scranton proud!

Everyone stands. As they exit:

MARCUS (to Linda, sotto)
Welcome to the paper jungle, kid.

LINDA (smiles nervously)
Thanks. I’ll try not to get… recycled.

They file out. BRIANNA taps the projector.

BRIANNA (alone, to projector)

1laegr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1laegr1/aita_for_ghosting_a_guy_because_he_insisted_on/,AITA for ghosting a guy because he insisted on going for drinks on our first date?,"I (20F) had been talking to this guy (22M) for about a month. We knew each other from school (he was a senior) and reconnected recently. The conversations were fun, flirty, and I was open to meeting him in person to see where things might go.

When we started planning a first date, he kept suggesting we go to a bar and get drinks. I personally don’t feel super comfortable drinking with someone I haven’t met properly yet, especially on a first date. I live in India, where that kind of setting—especially as a woman—can feel a little unsafe or just… not ideal unless I already know/trust the person.

So I subtly tried to suggest alternatives like coffee or lunch, hoping he’d take the hint. But every time, he pushed for drinks again. It wasn’t aggressive or anything, but it felt dismissive of my comfort. After a few back-and-forths like this, I ended up just losing interest and stopped replying.

Now I’m wondering: was that unfair of me? Should I have been more direct instead of ghosting him? Or was I right to just dip if I wasn’t feeling respected or unsure? 
edit : i guess ‘ghosting’ wasn’t the ideal word to use, i made up an excuse as to why i could not meet him (family commitment) when he just wouldn’t budge on the drinks idea ",97,1749817102.0,AITAH,284,0.76,False

No matter the weather, he just puts on his jacket and goes.

It got me wondering like... why haven't I ever thought of doing something like that? I'm pretty sure it'd be a great way to clear my head and get that day started on a positive note. With my work-from-home situation, it's all too easy to roll outta bed and head straight to my desk. No transition, no fresh air.

I think tomorrow I'm gonna try it. Just a little walk in the morning to see if it makes a difference in how I feel throughout the day. 🏃‍♀️ Might be wrong, but hey, it's worth a shot, right?",6,1749817082.0,snapinsight,0,1.0,False

1laeeao,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1laeeao/questions_for_those_that_have_or_had_a_longterm_ap/,"Questions for those that have, or had, a long-term AP","The TL/DR: I'm looking for my 1st AP and have a lot of questions about early stage dynamics and communication.  



Looking to gain some insight and have gotten some great advice here.  Possibly helpful to know is that I'm a male and looking to find a long term married, female AP.

 So...Finding that connection that actually works out seems to be a massive lesson in frustration, patience and persistence.  Over the past couple months I've probably written and read a novel's worth of messages covering everything from favorite book to detailed descriptions of the best orgasms we've ever had.  Sometimes it seems like a fools errand and it's annoying as hell when what seems like a great conversation and connection is developing, then...nothing.

I've connected with people through Reddit (great site), Ashley Madison (okay but 95% of the profiles for women are fake and scams), Sasha7 (site is total garbage) and Adult Friend Finder (good site, just not focused on this type of thing).

So here are my questions.  Any thoughts, perspective, insight and advice is appreciated: 

1 - How long did it take for you to meet your AP and where did you meet?

2 - Is it worth sending a second follow up message when your first one goes unanswered?  Initial contact I typically write out a paragraph or two as an introduction, comment on stuff in their profile and then say check my profile out and if interested hope they'll write back.  I've heard back from some, but wondering if women just get so many messages my initial one gets buried and maybe a quick note to say hello again is worth it?

3 - If you've had a great conversation going, but then it stalls how many times do you reach back out before you give up?  I've encountered this more than once where the conversation is great, there seems like a genuine connection and alignment on what we're both looking for.  Sexy photos are shared and mutual attraction is confirmed.  Then silence on their end.  I send another message and maybe get a half-hearted response, or none at all.  At what point do you consider the conversation over? 

4 - How do you successfully transition from an email/messaging conversation to meeting up in person?  I get meeting someone online can be sketchy, especially for woman so want both of us to be comfortable.  My approach is typically proposing to meet at a place for a coffee or something in a public setting that they're comfortable with.  I offer some times that work on my end and see if they'd be interested in meeting.  I always say that if there is no pressure and if they'd rather continue messaging that's okay.  For the woman I've messaged with where it got to the point where I'd want to actually meet this approach doesn't seem to work.  Is there something I should be doing differently?

4a - As a follow up to 4.  I've encountered now a couple times where I've proposed meeting, offered times that work for me and then I get a message back that continues the conversation but the question about meeting isn't even acknowledged.  Hey - if they're not ready to meet or can't make those times work, that's totally fine.  But just ignoring the question sucks because on my end I'm trying to keep those times open to potentially meet up.  On my end it comes across as disrespectful and makes me think it's an indicator that they're not serious.  Am I over-reacting?  

5 - What do you tell yourself when you're ghosted (in-person or online)?  I'm realistic about what I'm getting myself into.  I'm also the type that likes closure but figure with this type of relationship that's probably just setting myself up for disappointment.  I figure if someone dropped off the face of the planet then they found what they were looking for or had second thoughts or whatever, but curious to hear other perspective on this.

6 - Aside from writing long form personal messages, how do you build a rapport with someone?  I've encountered some women where we message and it seems like we could be a good fit for each other.  I'll write really long messages only to get a 1 - 2 sentences back.  I figure with these ones I should just give up and move on, but wondering if there is a way to jump start. One approach is to send more photos?  Leading to...

7 - How often and what types of photos do you send?  I have a few photos I share that gives enough sense of my build and what I look like with out showing off my face.  I don't send any dick picks.  I've also sent pictures of cool things (art, nature, etc.).    
Thank you wise ones of Reddit.  Again, any perspective is appreciated.  Best of luck to all of you.  

Thank you wise ones of Reddit for any perspective you might have.  Best of luck to all of you.  ",0,1749816898.0,adultery,3,0.29,False
1laee83,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1laee83/th_the_walk_on_a_desolate_road/,[TH] The walk on a desolate road.,"He had to walk along the dark and desolate road every day after work to reach his home. The old man's dark complexion and his scarred face made him a frightening sight. One glance at the man and people would assume that he was a criminal. But in truth the man was an honest and kind person. He never held any grudges, never fought with anyone and was very humble to the core, knowing his place in the societal hierarchy. The poor man always knew how to be content with whatever he had and tried his best to provide his family.  The road leading up to his house didn't fit with its surrounding architecture. The road was located in a prominent location within a bustling city, but still was desolate as it cut through big housing plots, and had compounds on both sides with big trees and bushes. The road did saw a fair amount of commute during the day, but at night it was deserted. And the man always had to walk during the night after ending his shift. After being hired for the job, the man had walked without any hesitation the first few days. But eventually he grew tired of walking the long distance every day and the labour intensive work that his job required would wear him out. Being a man in his late 40s, it was hard for the old man to walk home after a gruelling day of work. One day, while walking home, his knees gave up and it became hard to walk. The Man thought of asking for a lift from people who were passing by. Seeing his demeanour, even tough guys weighing a hundred kilos refused to stop and give the guy a lift to his home. Each passing day, his knees deteriorated and it became hard for him to walk. Every day the man would ask for a lift and no one would stop. Even if somebody did, they would refuse later seeing the man's face up close. One day the man even saw a person getting a lift by someone who refused him a ride few days earlier. The man was making deductions as to why he wasn't getting a ride home, but the poor man couldn't come up with any. It was summer and some people from the man's workplace were on leaves for vacations. The few workers left had to bear the load and deliver by working extra time. That day the man was totally exhausted by toiling all day, but somehow he managed to complete his work. Ecstatic at first, the man left the place in hurry to return home, but as he left the compound, he suddenly remembered that he has to walk the desolate road again. Reaching halfway through the road, the old man's knees gave up completely and he started dragging his feet along. He was desperate for a lift now more so than ever. He started looking out for one but there were no people on the road as he left his workplace late. His feet couldn't move no more so he sat on a nearby rock and waited for someone to pass by. Suddenly a dim yellow glow lit the dark road and the man heard a low rumbling voice. Finally, he saw a passerby and hoped he would get a ride home. When she saw the old man sitting on a rock from afar, a wave of fear struck the woman and she started regretting her decision of using the desolate road at this time. The man desperate for a ride home, jumped in front of her and begged for a lift. The man looked so hideous up close that the woman screamed with all her life. 
Luckily, Two men passing down that road heard her screams and ran towards it. When they came closer, they saw her running away in the opposite direction from the man, leaving her scooter on the ground. The man dragging himself behind her to explain, looked like a hunting zombie in the dark. The woman saw those two men and screamed for help. The men told her to calm down and assured her that there was no need to be afraid. The woman catching her breath, explained the men how the old man jumped in front of her bike and tried to do something with her, maybe rob or rape her. She was not sure. The mere suggestion of someone troubling the innocent women made the men furious. They walked up to the man, and grabbed him to interrogate. The man tried his best to explain, but his horrifying face didn't do him any good. The men started beating the poor man. The more he tried to explain, the more he got of those fists. Those attacks just added to the man's existing scars, both on his face and his psyche. Something changed from that day on, the once kind and humble man had turned cynical. The man who once spoke with utmost sincerity now became rude. He would dismiss people who tried to understand this abrupt change in him. The man knew loss, grieved over several unwanted happenings of his life but never for once in his life was he mistreated in such a harmful way. He never got involved in any fight or even argument of any sort as he always believed in peace. But that day on, these peaceful beliefs vanished from his mind. Maybe they fell out while the men were punching him, or maybe they faded with the sound of that woman's scream. From that day onwards, the man would finish his work and March straight to his house. He never bothered to ask for a lift after that incident . He just kept ignoring his knees and would drag himself home every day. One day while walking home, he saw the same woman on her scooter riding past him. She didn't saw him but the old man's weak eyes recognized her even in the dark. A significant amount of blood gushed in to the nerve travelling across his brain. His scarred face turned red in anger, and suddenly he got a feeling which he never had before. He wanted to smash her face like he smashed up iron at this workplace. He suppressed the dreadful feeling and just moved ahead. A few days passed and the man would see the woman again and again till the time that he would see her daily. Her presence would just pile up his anger and bring him closer to the idea of smashing her head for real. The workers had to turn in all the tools before leaving the compound every day. But that day the man kept a pointed file with him in his tiffin bag. The file was flat on one side but had a pointy edge on the other side, sharp enough to cut through flesh. He stepped on the road, and kept walking till he saw the rock. He waited for her on the rock. She took her time, but eventually the dim yellow glow of her scooter showed up and the man got up, readying himself with the file in his hand. The man started walking in the same direction slowly to hide his face and not startle the woman. As the woman got closer, he suddenly jumped in front of her. The woman's reflexes kicked in and she hit the brakes, slightly bumping into the old man. The man quickly grabbed the handle, moved behind her scooter and sat on the pillion seat. Before the woman could cope up with anything and scream for help, the man held the pointy edge of the file to her throat. He specifically instructed her to not scream because if she did, he assured her that he would slit her throat. The woman offered him money, or even her scooter, but he declined. She started assuming the worst, he was here to rape her. But he wasn't interested in that too. When the sobbing woman asked what he was interested in, the man with a very generous tone, said that he only wanted a ride home. At first the woman was surprised to hear this demand, still speculating, the woman thought he would have whatever he wanted once they reached his destination. She started the scooter and slowly moved ahead, trying to keep the balance with her shivering body. As they moved forward, the man kept talking with her. He told her about his native place, his younger days, about his family and friends and sometimes about his work. His tone so normal that one would think that they were chatting over a coffee. Only the difference was that this conversation was one sided and she was only listening because of the knife that was hanging near her throat. The constant tearing up of her eyes made it impossible to see on the dimly lit road. She was somehow managing until they came across a bump on the road. She failed to anticipate the severity of the bump and it jolted on the old scooter hard. Due to the inertia, the old man momentarily lost control and the weapon in his hand made a small cut on the woman's neck. Assuming that the old man had slit her throat, the woman left both her hands from the scooter's handle and held her neck to check on the cut. In all that chaos, she lost control over the scooter and a few moments later, the scooter was hugging the ground. The man anticipating the fall jumped from the scooter, but the poor woman was trapped under it. She looked around hoping that somebody would help her, but she soon realised that they were alone on the road and her judgement was near. The man suddenly coming to his senses, dragged himself to help the woman. As he tried to come closer, the woman raised her voice. She started weeping like a little child, begging him to spare her. The poor woman was already in agony as the entire weight of the scooter was on her leg. When she saw that the man with the pointy file in his hand was closing in on her, she screamed for help. She screamed as loud as her voice could be, desperately trying to free her trapped leg. The screams which brought hope to the desperate woman, brought painful memories back to the mind of the old man. Those were the same screams that made his night miserable, that made him feel like a vermin. That was it, the scream triggered him furiously and he charged at the screaming woman with his weapon. The man who was once moving towards her with the intention of helping her was now determined to silence her. His actions weren't in control of himself, it was as if something had possessed him. He grabbed her by the chin and stabbed the woman straight in the front of her neck, assuring her silence. The blood splattered across the man's face, and then it kept flowing on the road painting it red. The woman choked on the flowing blood and then finally fell silent. The man slightly picked up the scooter and moved it aside to free the woman. He picked her up and threw her in the bushes nearby. Taking out a handkerchief from his pocket, he wiped off the blood from his face. He picked up the bloodied scooter and parked it in the place. He didn't do much to hide his crime. He left all the evidence at the crime scene itself. He had nothing to hide, neither was he scared of the consequences of his actions. He wanted a ride home and he got that. He walked what few steps had left to his home. The pain in his knees was obsolete. Or maybe they were paining, but he didn't care. After a long time, instead of dragging himself, he was walking as he once used to.

I'm tattoo lover (don't have enough of them yet), coffee addict (let's say 4 daily aren't enough). I'm beard owner, probably my hair are longer than yours 😏. 

Bit sarcastic, mostly bored and mostly here. If I won't reply I'm either busy working, playing games or just lazy to check, but hey, trying my best! I can annoy you with random shts, sky or sunset pics out of nowhere, or just hypnotize you with my eyes👀. 

I'm rock listener, shows watcher and gamer (mentioned above). I prefer long-term chats, that's always nice, I'm havin hard time remembering names, so if you'll say yours, I'll have to scroll up😅. If we click, we can move somewhere else, as this crap is laggy or not working properly most, of the time. 🤷🏻‍♂️ I don't do voice calls, but I have no problem with voice notes I guess. 

If it sounds at least bit interesting, hit me up, don't be scared! 

Bonus for you: if you could live anywhere, where would it be? 🤔",1,1749816816.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

Maybe remember last time yung story ng isang now formerly owe grade 9 student paani siya napahiya sa mga evangelicals niyang classmates dahil sa kakulangan ng alam niya sa Bible? Then sa second update ko i saw her by chance sa isang coffee shop reading the Bible and taking notes?

Latest Update:

I meet her again she is now Grade 10 student ngayong darating na pasukan and now she is no longer INC owe but converted as Baptist.

Felt happy for her as nakikita ko siya nagtuturo sa mga small kids ng Bible stories not like sa PNK na brainwashing at repetitive ang itinuturo at the young age!  Congratulations sa kanya she now finally free and mas mukha siyang maaliwas at happy kaysa noong nasa INCulto siya at the same time her dedication to teach sa mga maliliit na batang paslit na mga anak ng baptist members. 

Congratulatios to her...",7,1749816808.0,exIglesiaNiCristo,1,1.0,False
