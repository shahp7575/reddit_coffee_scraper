*November 13, 2025*

So... This wasn't what I was expecting to see yesterday. I work in an office in the northern United States. Most of the people who work there are other young women (just a coincidence, the ratio is around 3:1).

The past few months someone has been leaving an assorted box of Tampax Pearls on the counter. Whenever it started running low, another one would pop right up. We originally thought it was another woman in the office, but no one came forward, so we just assumed someone didn't want to admit it.

But today I needed to to prepare the office for a round of interviews HR was conducting, and I got there very early in the morning. That's when I caught my male coworker (around our same age) leaving the women's restroom which is when it all clicked together. He didn't notice I caught him since his back was turned to me while walking out (he gets there way before anyone else does and probably wasn't expecting anyone else to be there that early).

I went to his desk later and spoke to him about it since the two of us talk a lot.. I brought it up and let him know I say him walking out of the women's restroom this morning, and he seemed very embarrassed that someone found out.

He said the reason he did it was because he noticed the office was largely filled with women and felt bad that everything in the restroom is free except for the tampons, so he wanted to do something thoughtful. He never intended on other people finding out.

I told him I was just as surprised as him and that I personally thought it was sweet, but how would the rest of you react to this?

># Notable Comments:

I’d keep his secret. He doesn’t want recognition. He just wants to make the workplace better for the people he shares it with. I can’t think of anything concerning about this at all.

I don’t know what there is to be concerned about. Your coworker seems particularly thoughtful of others. Do you think he’s tampering with them or something? If they’re in sealed packages, I can’t see how that would happen. And he’s obviously not doing it for some kind of clout since he was placing them in secret. He seems like a nice person.

Sorry if the title sounded like bait lol. It's what happened, didn't mean for it to sound concerning.

I admit I was overreacting. I think I was just more surprised than anything and taken offguard. In hindsight I'm glad we have guys who are willing to step up and do things like this (:

___

I'm not going to tell anyone strictly on the fact our place has dispensers for Tampons you need to pay for, and the last thing I want is for him to get in an HR confliction with having to pay for them or something like that

I shouldn't be concerned either, I mean he literally gets there at like 6 AM, the first woman gets into the office at 7:30 usually

*November 20, 2025, 7 days later*

Thank you to everyone who commented and helped ease my concerns. I admit I was overreacting a bit. I think I was just surprised and taken off guard that morning when I saw him.

This week I actually went into the office early again just to speak to him in person without anyone else overhearing. I told him that I thought his gesture was sweet and wanted to know if he wanted to grab coffee after work as a way to thank him. He accepted.

FIRST. He thanked me for not telling our coworkers (he doesn't mind if I tell people outside of work as long as I leave his name and personal info out).

He told me that he didn't want to make a big deal about the gesture because he was used to being in similar situations working around women. He used to work as a lifeguard at an indoor park when he was in high school/ college, but at that job it was mostly other men. He told me that the number 1 task that the other guys hated was being assigned to clean the women's restroom when it was time to close. That's because the guy lifeguards could only clean it once it was fully cleared, so whoever was assigned to it would always be the last lifeguard to clock out.

But he'd just volunteer to do it since there was no way to avoid it. He told me that he got to know a lot of the regular women there as well as the High School swim coaches and students on the ladies swim team, and they were completely comfortable around him. They'd let him in even when they were still using the bathroom as long as they weren't actively changing or butt naked.

He thanked me for listening and said he was glad I didn't find it creepy. He also opened up and said the main reason he started bringing tampons (aside form the office mainly being filled with women) is because he grew up the eldest son with 3 brothers and no sister, and he always wanted a baby sister to look after but never got one, so he's really hoping for a daughter one day.

I told him I thought that was so sweet (because most men only want a son as a preference, so I wasn't expecting any guy to say that).

I offered to pay for the coffee like promised and we ended the evening after talking a bit more about home life, we're hoping to make it a weekly thing now after work.

Thanks all for your reassurance. Hopefully it's a little wholesome story that'll brighten your week as well (:

1p1z9k9,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1p1z9k9/my_story_and_how_i_got_cured/,My story and how I got cured,"Cross-posting to GERD, LPR, functional dyspepsia, and gastritis. All formal diagnoses that I received from GI/ENT doctors for my condition(s).

Like many of you now, there was a point of time when I was coming to this subreddit daily searching for a magic pill to cure my suffering. I promised myself that if I ever escaped this hell, that I would come back to share my story and hopefully help others. Thankfully, I believe that day has come.

I’m keeping this post very detailed to highlight my story, but will keep a TLDR at the end.

It all started on August 14th 2024. After a meal, I felt heat across my body and felt a strong wave of nausea. Eventually over the next few days, the nausea became persistent, and I started feeling bloated. I struggled to eat any food, and started losing weight. 2 weeks later, when it became clear this isn’t stomach flu, I went to a doctor. He prescribed Vonoprozan for 10 days. This minimally helped, but I still felt constantly nauseous. After the 10-day course, he referred me to a GI, who told me to continue for another 20 days. 

This again didn’t do much, so a month after that, I had an endoscopy. I was diagnosed with gastritis, with the observation of being hyperemic at fundus and proximal body. Antrum pathcy erythema. By this time I was browsing Reddit frequently, looking for tips. Since vonoprozan wasn’t helping at all, I decided to quit all PPI and follow a strict bland diet. My breakfast was bananas and oats, my lunch and dinner was boiled vegetables and boiled rice. By this time I’d dropped around 20 pounds, was struggling to get any nutrition in, and was desperate to try anything. My anxiety was frequent, and the pain was a constant tormentor. During all this time, I was frequently visiting the GI, with minimal usefulness. I also moved in with my parents temporarily as I was struggling to manage my daily life.

5 months after my initial diagnosis, my GI decided to do another endoscopy to check whether the first had missed anything, and to reevaluate whether it could be an eosinophilic disease. We dived in, and ultimately, the doctor said I had no visible inflammation. He diagnosed me with functional dyspepsia, and prescribed me Mirtazapine, a tricyclic antidepressant. Out of fear of side effects I DID NOT take this medication. Shortly after, I moved out of the state, so I could not fill the prescription anyway.

By this time the symptoms were more in my throat. A feeling of acid reflux, burning pain, tightness, and globus sensation following meals. Burping caused a burning feeling in my throat. Frequent upper ab pain. The original nausea was thankfully gone and the bloating more minimal. However, this throat pain was a constant torment, would pop up after meals (usually breakfast), and rarely felt fine. I had constant anxiety and struggled with daily life. Another GI I visited diagnosed me with GERD based on endoscopic biopsies, handed me more PPIs and sent me on my way.

I had tried every supplement I had heard of; zinc carnosine, aloe vera juice, psyllium husks, DGL, D-limonene, IsoVive, Florastor, other probiotics, and many more. None had a lasting effect. I was visiting this subreddit daily. I spent hours a day googling symptoms, looking for solutions. I was adhering to a super strict diet (gluten-free, low acid, low FODMAP, vegan). I was meditating. I was doing EVERYTHING I could. No relief. By browsing the subreddit I had self-diagnosed myself with SIBO, gallbladder issues, thyroid issues, celiac, and more. The state I was living in had a waiting list of 4 - 6 months to see a specialist, so none of these doubts would get relieved anytime soon.

In July of this year, I started a new internship. As part of the benefits, I received 25 free mental health visits. A podcast I watched talked about how someone who had chronic back pain had healed through something called Pain Reprocessing Therapy ([https://www.painreprocessingtherapy.com/](https://www.painreprocessingtherapy.com/)). I was sure this didn’t apply to me, but since I had the free visits, I decided to find a practitioner in my area, and started visiting a psychologist. I told them clearly that this didn’t apply to me, but I was desperate, and if there was a shadow of a doubt that it could help me, I would take it. Based on my history, they felt fairly confident that they could help me.

The logic behind the therapy is that sometimes the brain memorizes some form of pain. This causes the pain to become chronic, despite the original cause behind the pain healing. The more attention you give the pain, you more you try to cure it, the more it tells the brain that this pain is important, and the more the brain sends the pain signals. This has all been verified through fMRI scans of folks with chronic pain ([https://www.colorado.edu/today/2021/09/29/how-therapy-not-pills-can-nix-chronic-pain-and-change-brain](https://www.colorado.edu/today/2021/09/29/how-therapy-not-pills-can-nix-chronic-pain-and-change-brain)). 

The therapy involved three main things:

1. Acknowledging there’s no physical cause to the pain. As long as you believe there’s an issue in your body, the brain will keep the memory of the pain. This step was the hardest for me to acknowledge.
2. Retrain the relationship with the pain. Avoid emotional backlash like anxiety, fear, and worry when the pain pops up. This involved something called ‘somatic tracking’.
3. Eventually untrain any ‘crutches’ I was using to reduce the pain. Stop restrictive dieting and get back to a normal lifestyle. Don’t treat myself any different because of the pain.

None of this came easy. None of it I believed in (at the time). Eventually each of them came true until I felt normal again. I had tried each of these in the past individually to no avail. It wasn’t until I worked with an experienced psychologist that I could actually work through these issues. 

The big turning point came when I had a road trip planned with friends. I was very anxious about this trip and the pain, and packed a bunch of ‘safe’ foods to take with me. The trip was amazing, had a ton of fun, forgot about my issues, ate Indian food and pizza with no pain. The day I returned to office, the pain also returned. This showed me the pain’s true face, and I redoubled my efforts in therapy. At that point I became 100% convinced my pain was psychologically induced.

Shortly after ending the therapy, I finally had an appointment with an ENT. They did a laryngoscopy and said I had mild inflammation and signs of LPR. They said it was a common cause of throat pain for many. Reader, by this time I had no pain and had resumed normal life completely. 

I’m not a person who has had mental issues in the past. I was not going through an anxious or stressful time when the symptoms started (in fact the opposite, I was having a great time). Despite this, my relief finally came through therapy. For many people I see on these subreddits, I feel the same could be true for you.

My situation could LIKELY apply to you if one or more of the following are true:

* The symptoms came out of nowhere.
* The symptoms came during a time of high stress/anxiety.
* The symptoms came because of a normal cause, but persist long beyond the expected duration (e.g., stomach flu, viral infection, HPylori post-treatment)
* Medications (like PPIs) provide limited to no relief.
* Doctors find limited stomach/esophagus damage (e.g., functional dyspepsia, ‘mild’ gastritis, ‘mild’ inflammation)
* Your pain comes in ‘flares’, not necessarily related to what or when you eat.
* BIG ONE: You have periods where you magically feel fine. Maybe when you’re on vacation?
* Your symptoms have ‘shifted’ over time. E.g., started in stomach, moved to throat, moved to back, etc.
* You’ve been diagnosed with nerve hypersensitivity (e.g., esophageal hypersensitivity).

You could have experienced all of the above, you might have only experienced one or two. 

This likely does NOT apply to you if:

* You have severe, visible organ damage (severe gastritis, severe esophagitis, visible LPR damage). Keep in mind, I specify severe, because in my scopes I had what my doctors referred to as ‘mild’ inflammation in both my stomach and throat. Many doctors will admit mild inflammation is quite common even among asymptomatic individuals.
* You’ve been diagnosed with Eosinophilic esophagitis/gastritis.
* You have Celiac disease.

Ultimately, I am NOT A DOCTOR. You are the best judge of whether my advice applies to you. However, I will give a word of warning that if I saw this post when I was in pain, I would not believe it applied to me. I had no major mental issues and I had formal diagnoses from doctors with visible inflammation. Nonetheless, working with a psychologist cured me of my symptoms and feels nothing short of a miracle.

The ""Inclusive Pastors Network"" as I am calling it, is more of a group of ministry leaders meeting quarterly or so. We would share trials, successes,  and try to help give resources to each other based on experience and knowledge. The goal being to support each other but to also build bridges of communication among radically inclusive churches. We seem to all be isolated to our own denominations and I'd love to see those barriers broken down. And this could open up for possible cooperation in future projects like food pantries, recovery ministries, etc. 

We could start with meeting at a coffee shop, for those who are interested.  It could be for an hour or so each time. If you know of anyone here is my email:

Like many of you now, there was a point of time when I was coming to this subreddit daily searching for a magic pill to cure my suffering. I promised myself that if I ever escaped this hell, that I would come back to share my story and hopefully help others. Thankfully, I believe that day has come.

I’m keeping this post very detailed to highlight my story, but will keep a TLDR at the end.

It all started on August 14th 2024. After a meal, I felt heat across my body and felt a strong wave of nausea. Eventually over the next few days, the nausea became persistent, and I started feeling bloated. I struggled to eat any food, and started losing weight. 2 weeks later, when it became clear this isn’t stomach flu, I went to a doctor. He prescribed Vonoprozan for 10 days. This minimally helped, but I still felt constantly nauseous. After the 10-day course, he referred me to a GI, who told me to continue for another 20 days. 

This again didn’t do much, so a month after that, I had an endoscopy. I was diagnosed with gastritis, with the observation of being hyperemic at fundus and proximal body. Antrum pathcy erythema. By this time I was browsing Reddit frequently, looking for tips. Since vonoprozan wasn’t helping at all, I decided to quit all PPI and follow a strict bland diet. My breakfast was bananas and oats, my lunch and dinner was boiled vegetables and boiled rice. By this time I’d dropped around 20 pounds, was struggling to get any nutrition in, and was desperate to try anything. My anxiety was frequent, and the pain was a constant tormentor. During all this time, I was frequently visiting the GI, with minimal usefulness. I also moved in with my parents temporarily as I was struggling to manage my daily life.

5 months after my initial diagnosis, my GI decided to do another endoscopy to check whether the first had missed anything, and to reevaluate whether it could be an eosinophilic disease. We dived in, and ultimately, the doctor said I had no visible inflammation. He diagnosed me with functional dyspepsia, and prescribed me Mirtazapine, a tricyclic antidepressant. Out of fear of side effects I DID NOT take this medication. Shortly after, I moved out of the state, so I could not fill the prescription anyway.

By this time the symptoms were more in my throat. A feeling of acid reflux, burning pain, tightness, and globus sensation following meals. Burping caused a burning feeling in my throat. Frequent upper ab pain. The original nausea was thankfully gone and the bloating more minimal. However, this throat pain was a constant torment, would pop up after meals (usually breakfast), and rarely felt fine. I had constant anxiety and struggled with daily life. Another GI I visited diagnosed me with GERD based on endoscopic biopsies, handed me more PPIs and sent me on my way.

I had tried every supplement I had heard of; zinc carnosine, aloe vera juice, psyllium husks, DGL, D-limonene, IsoVive, Florastor, other probiotics, and many more. None had a lasting effect. I was visiting this subreddit daily. I spent hours a day googling symptoms, looking for solutions. I was adhering to a super strict diet (gluten-free, low acid, low FODMAP, vegan). I was meditating. I was doing EVERYTHING I could. No relief. By browsing the subreddit I had self-diagnosed myself with SIBO, gallbladder issues, thyroid issues, celiac, and more. The state I was living in had a waiting list of 4 - 6 months to see a specialist, so none of these doubts would get relieved anytime soon.

In July of this year, I started a new internship. As part of the benefits, I received 25 free mental health visits. A podcast I watched talked about how someone who had chronic back pain had healed through something called Pain Reprocessing Therapy ([https://www.painreprocessingtherapy.com/](https://www.painreprocessingtherapy.com/)). I was sure this didn’t apply to me, but since I had the free visits, I decided to find a practitioner in my area, and started visiting a psychologist. I told them clearly that this didn’t apply to me, but I was desperate, and if there was a shadow of a doubt that it could help me, I would take it. Based on my history, they felt fairly confident that they could help me.

The logic behind the therapy is that sometimes the brain memorizes some form of pain. This causes the pain to become chronic, despite the original cause behind the pain healing. The more attention you give the pain, you more you try to cure it, the more it tells the brain that this pain is important, and the more the brain sends the pain signals. This has all been verified through fMRI scans of folks with chronic pain ([https://www.colorado.edu/today/2021/09/29/how-therapy-not-pills-can-nix-chronic-pain-and-change-brain](https://www.colorado.edu/today/2021/09/29/how-therapy-not-pills-can-nix-chronic-pain-and-change-brain)). 

The therapy involved three main things:

1. Acknowledging there’s no physical cause to the pain. As long as you believe there’s an issue in your body, the brain will keep the memory of the pain. This step was the hardest for me to acknowledge.
2. Retrain the relationship with the pain. Avoid emotional backlash like anxiety, fear, and worry when the pain pops up. This involved something called ‘somatic tracking’.
3. Eventually untrain any ‘crutches’ I was using to reduce the pain. Stop restrictive dieting and get back to a normal lifestyle. Don’t treat myself any different because of the pain.

None of this came easy. None of it I believed in (at the time). Eventually each of them came true until I felt normal again. I had tried each of these in the past individually to no avail. It wasn’t until I worked with an experienced psychologist that I could actually work through these issues. 

The big turning point came when I had a road trip planned with friends. I was very anxious about this trip and the pain, and packed a bunch of ‘safe’ foods to take with me. The trip was amazing, had a ton of fun, forgot about my issues, ate Indian food and pizza with no pain. The day I returned to office, the pain also returned. This showed me the pain’s true face, and I redoubled my efforts in therapy. At that point I became 100% convinced my pain was psychologically induced.

Shortly after ending the therapy, I finally had an appointment with an ENT. They did a laryngoscopy and said I had mild inflammation and signs of LPR. They said it was a common cause of throat pain for many. Reader, by this time I had no pain and had resumed normal life completely. 

I’m not a person who has had mental issues in the past. I was not going through an anxious or stressful time when the symptoms started (in fact the opposite, I was having a great time). Despite this, my relief finally came through therapy. For many people I see on these subreddits, I feel the same could be true for you.

My situation could LIKELY apply to you if one or more of the following are true:

* The symptoms came out of nowhere.
* The symptoms came during a time of high stress/anxiety.
* The symptoms came because of a normal cause, but persist long beyond the expected duration (e.g., stomach flu, viral infection, HPylori post-treatment)
* Medications (like PPIs) provide limited to no relief.
* Doctors find limited stomach/esophagus damage (e.g., functional dyspepsia, ‘mild’ gastritis, ‘mild’ inflammation)
* Your pain comes in ‘flares’, not necessarily related to what or when you eat.
* BIG ONE: You have periods where you magically feel fine. Maybe when you’re on vacation?
* Your symptoms have ‘shifted’ over time. E.g., started in stomach, moved to throat, moved to back, etc.
* You’ve been diagnosed with nerve hypersensitivity (e.g., esophageal hypersensitivity).

You could have experienced all of the above, you might have only experienced one or two. 

This likely does NOT apply to you if:

* You have severe, visible organ damage (severe gastritis, severe esophagitis, visible LPR damage). Keep in mind, I specify severe, because in my scopes I had what my doctors referred to as ‘mild’ inflammation in both my stomach and throat. Many doctors will admit mild inflammation is quite common even among asymptomatic individuals.
* You’ve been diagnosed with Eosinophilic esophagitis/gastritis.
* You have Celiac disease.

Ultimately, I am NOT A DOCTOR. You are the best judge of whether my advice applies to you. However, I will give a word of warning that if I saw this post when I was in pain, I would not believe it applied to me. I had no major mental issues and I had formal diagnoses from doctors with visible inflammation. Nonetheless, working with a psychologist cured me of my symptoms and feels nothing short of a miracle.

1p1z8kc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p1z8kc,Anyone know this novel?,"I was heartbroken when I discovered that my husband had already drafted the divorce papers accidentally.
Why he...?
When padded toward the room, I heard my husband talking to another woman on the phone.
""I can't talk right now, she's just in the other room.""
""I want to touch you, too. I will be there this weekend.""
The words hit like physical blows, each one stealing more air from my lungs. 
The apple slips from my trembling fingers, and I barely catch it before it can hit the floor and reveal my presence. 
I stood behind that door, head bowed in defeat and listened while my own husband insulted me, declared his love for another and promised to be by her side by lunch. 
The world tilts sideways, reality fragmenting like a broken mirror. 
So this was the truth.
Everything had come to an end then for me.
My whole marriage was a scam and that I was probably the only party still unaware. 
————————

Lizzy sat on the couch she hated. The leather was smooth and cold, she had no idea how much it had cost but knew it had to be a number with five figures. Her father had had almost the same one in his private office.
She took a sip from the white wine she had dared to pour. In these three long years of marriage, she could count on one hand the number of bottles she had dared to pop open. Yet, she was already on her fourth glass, the alcohol hadn't really helped but she felt better crying with the brain fog than without.
The young woman had her legs folded beside her and absentmindedly toed at the thick pile of papers sitting beside her. Those few hundreds pages had been her constant companion for the past couple of days. She had read and re-read every words until they were seared into her brain.
Finally, the sound of a key turning into a lock echoed in the otherwise silent house. Silence hadn't bothered her at first. Since childhood, silence had meant peace, reprieve. It meant a break into hells. Then she had gotten married and silence took another meaning entirely.
The rhythmic sound of her husband's steps, the one she knew by heart, echoed while she poured herself yet another glass. She'd need it.
She heard him pass by the living room without hesitation. He never greeted her.
He went upstairs and the house was too well insulated to hear anything else. Lizzy didn't know how much time had passed when she suddenly had her husband standing a few feet away in the living room, looking at her. Finally. She had prayed for him to pay her attention, to turn her way, prayed and prayed. And yet, right now she wanted him to look away. She didn't want him to see her now, not like that.
""What is the meaning of this ?"" Had his tone always been so cold ? Yes, it definitely had. However, she was only now noticing the tinge of hatred, the slash of disgust melted in the husky timbre.
""I always thought it was an arranged marriage,"" she started in a firm but hoarse voice, before swallowing a bit more liquid courage. ""Like most people in our circle do. Love may not be the motor but trust and affection could be built on these foundations... I never knew it was a forced union for you.""
""Elizabeth,"" he said in an annoyed tone and she just knew he had that frown on his face, the one he used to show her how inadequate she was. How unfitting.
""I should have known,"" she laughed lowly but it was empty and it hurt to produce. ""God, you were so obvious !""
""Is that the Sauvignon Blanc my sister sent last month ?"" He clicked his tongue. Of course, he only cared about that. He found his wife crying and drinking on her own at one am in the dark and the only thing he saw was the expensive wine she had no business touching.
Lizzy twirled the pretty liquid in her glass, enjoying how the fireplace's light drew amber patterns on the surface.
""Just cut the tantrum now. I'm too tired for that sh-""
She took the first file from the pile and carelessly tossed it on the coffee table. For a short moment, the kind of heavy silence that used to make her skin crawl resonated, though this time she savoured it.
""Did you go through my stuff ?"" He growled out menacingly.
Dante had never been physically violent to her. Rough during sexual interaction ? Sometimes. But he had never raised his hand against her. It didn't make it easier to bear that tone. Not really. It made her feel like she was that little girl again, like when she crossed her father's sight and he was reminded of what a failure his only child was.
Lizzy's lips tilted up into a self deprecating smile. The divorce papers were filled, his part already darkened by his informations and his signature long dry on the paper. Her own was still fresh. Only twelve hours old.
""How long has it been waiting ?"" She dared to ask. There was a lot she wouldn't, but this, this she felt like she should know. How long had he been planning on divorcing her ?
""Elizabeth, you have no right-""
""But I do,"" she cut him off and it was shocking enough to effectively shut him up. ""It is my right as your wife and mistress of this house.""
""What is wrong with you today ?"" He finally stepped into her field of vision, his imposing built standing on the other side of the table to glare down at her.
She had married the most handsome man ever. When her father had announced she was to be wed to Dante Giovanni, Lizzy's heart had wept in relief before she even met him. At least, she wasn't sold off to her father's awful friend, the one she did meet. And marrying into the Giovanni's family... It was everything she could have ever hoped for. Had he been twenty years older than her, fat or deformed, she would still have happily agreed. Not that she had any choice anyways, but this had been the best order she had ever received.
And then she had walked up the altar. The second he took her hand from her father, she owed him a life debt. He didn't have to look so good doing it. Three years later and she still hadn't tired of his dark brown eyes framed by thick, long lashes. His silky ebony strands reached beneath his ears and curled. His plump lips tasted divine though most of the time they only served to sneer or frown at her. He was Italian beauty by excellence. A statue come to life. A masterpiece of nature.
And she was only Elizabeth Clark.
""When did you fill it ?"" She finally met his eyes. For the first time ever, her heart stayed still. Whatever had consumed her, the burning embers that stubbornly held on after her husband's vaillant efforts had relentlessly tried to douse the fire, the sparks that wouldn't extinguish... It was all finally over.
It took her three years. Three cold, lonely years but Lizzy had finally fallen out of love for this man she had taken one look at and sworn to love and honour forever. She had tried her best, now she could move on.
....
The urge to feel his arms around her was gone. So was the tightening of her heart when he stared back into her own blue eyes.
Suddenly she had a flashback of their first pecking. After the priest had allowed them to proceed, she had been frozen, too enraptured by his looks, by his accented voice as he took his vows, drunk on the knowledge that she was finally free. So he had to do all the work. He wrapped his solid arm around her trembling body and leaned down until their lips touched. Lizzy had never been pecked by another man before. She had spent the past twenty four years dreading intimacy, fearing men as a whole. Only a tiny, quiet part of her had been expecting it, pondering on what had made billions upon billions of people worship those relationships for millenia. And then she had her first taste of a man. He was firm, like a rock, but also so tender. She had melted under his touch, unable to respond in any manner but eager for more at the same time. Dante had delivered and up until that moment she had only felt deep gratitude for him, but after that pecking, it had turned into love.
He never did anything that would make her misunderstand though. Her husband made it clear where they stood. However, Lizzy hadn't really witnessed any marital relationships before, or anything remotely romantic at all. Anything available for her to watch was first filtered by her father whom absolutely loathed romance, same went for what she could read. So Lizzy hadn't resented the state of their marriage. It sounded normal, good even, compared to what her parents had proposed. It took her time to reacquaint herself to the outside world, to rebuild all her notions about everything, to watch and learn, it took her even longer to examine her own marriage and understand how wrong it was. The hurt had started early on, but she used to beat herself up for even thinking so ungratefully.
Dante frowned down at the thick file, the one she had found in his study, not even hidden really, it stood on top of everything else in his first unlocked drawer.
When it became clear he wouldn't even grant her that answer she went on.
""I heard you a week ago,"" she admitted and this time the lump in her throat was manageable. She had poured too many tears over that incident already. ""Before you left for this business trip."" She scoffed. ""Business trip... How many of those were really just you going to your mistress ?"" She waited this time, fair enough to give him some breath for defense. His silence shouldn't have hurt this much. ""I didn't ask much of you. No love, not even affection... I understand that these parts of the vows can be a bit tricky for people entering this kind of unions, but respect ? I promised myself to work hard on this marriage. Every day, I swore to try harder and I did. Only two sins were unforgivable in my books. Apart from those, I could forgive anything.""
""Are you lecturing me right now ?"" His strongly accented voice finally broke through Lizzy's one sided conversation. ""After everything you did to trap me in this nightmare ?""
""What did I ever do ?"" Lizzy forced her voice to remain neutral despite the pain she felt at his description of life with her.
""You forced me here,"" he accused, his voice and eyes dripping with hatred and resentment.
""I didn't,"" she shook her head. ""My father ordered me to wed you, so I did. Was I happy with his choice of a husband ? Yes. Did I know you were forced into it ? No.""
""You don't need to lie,"" he smirked cruelly. ""I have witnesses who saw you get on your knees and beg your father for this marriage.""
Lizzy's breath caught in her throat as she was thrown back over three years ago. She remembered the scene as if it had only happened yesterday. The feeling of her father's grip around her throat, his hot breath in her ears as he informed her of the price his dear friend, the one who had once raped a maid on her bed and made her watch when she was only thirteen, had put on her hand now that her father was willing to see her go. Yes, she had gotten on her knees and begged to proceed with Giovianni's proposal instead.
Without a word, she picked up the second file lying by her feet and tossed it next to the divorce papers. His eyes widened slightly as he recognised this one.
This one had been well hidden. It had taken her a very long time to find. Everyone could discover that Dante Giovanni wished to divorce his wife but what was written in this marriage contract was much more delicate.
A week ago, Lizzy had woken up early to prepare breakfast for her husband. During her first year of marriage, she used to do it everyday, she had spent the couple of months before getting married locked up in the kitchen, cutting and burning herself but desperate to learn as much as she could to have something, anything, to offer to the man who was saving her. Her confidence slowly crumbled in front of his ignorance, until she finally gave up the embarrassing show. However, this was their third anniversary and though she knew better than to expect anything from him, and even better than to prepare anything grand herself, she had wanted to do something. Dante had forgotten again and was leaving on a business trip for a week, but she had gotten up at four and made all his favorites before walking up to his bedroom. They didn't sleep together, not everyday. They had separate bedrooms and when the mood struck him, he came to hers. Lizzy was always happy to welcome him in her sheets and arms, eager for this now familiar warmth and feeling of intimacy. In those moments, when he held her at night, they finally felt like a real couple. It helped that it felt amazing. She was thankful that the mood struck him often enough and apart from when he left for business, he spent at the very least every other day in her bed. His own bedroom was forbidden territory and she had been very hesitant to knock, it took her long enough for her ears to get accustomed and for her brain to translate the conversation going on. Unbeknownst to her husband, Lizzy had learned italian. She wasn't very smart, had stopped school after high school and her education hadn't been of much importance to her father after her mother's death, so it had been a grueling job to learn the new language but she had craved that link with her husband. Also, before finally giving up on being welcomed, she had been eager to get along with her foreign family-in-law too.
So she had understood everything her husband had told some stranger over the phone. Every term of endearments she had secretly dreamed of hearing directed at her. She stood behind that door, head bowed in defeat and listened while her own husband insulted her, declared his love for another and promised to be by his mistress's side by lunch. She had to listen as he promised to meet her at his mother's house where they were going to eat as a family. While Lizzy stayed home on her own.
On automatic mode, she found herself back in the kitchen and staring at the italian sweets she had carefully baked this very morning. Her husband was still on the phone as he came downstairs, he barely slowed down to glance at the table, not even bothering to cut the conversation now that he was in the presence of his legal wife. She wouldn't understand anyways. She met his eyes as he asked the unknown woman what piece of jewelry she would like as a gift.
Everything had come to an end then for Lizzy.",1,1763632483.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1p1z26b,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentSecrets/comments/1p1z26b/8_time_management_tips_for_students/,8 Time Management Tips for Students,"Attending classes, studying for exams, making friends, and taking time to relax and decompress can quickly fill up your schedule. If you often find yourself wishing there were more hours in the day, this guide will offer time management tips for students so you can accomplish what you need to get done, have fun with your friends, and gain back some valuable time for yourself. 

# 1. Create a Calendar

Don’t be caught by surprise by an important paper due two days from now or a dinner with your family the same night you planned for a group study session. Create a calendar for yourself with all your upcoming deadlines, exams, social events, and other time commitments well in advance so you can see what’s coming up. 

Keep your calendar in a place where you can see it every day, such as in your planner or on your wall above your desk. If you prefer a digital calendar, check it first thing every day to keep those important events fresh and top-of-mind. For greater efficiency, make sure you can integrate it with your other tools, such as your email.

Digital calendar options include: 

* Google Calendar 
* Outlook Calendar
* Fantastical
* Calendly

# 2. Set Reminders

After you’ve created your calendar, give yourself periodic reminders to stay on track such as to complete a study guide in advance or schedule a meeting for a group project. Knowing deadlines is important; however, staying on top of the micro tasks involved in meeting those deadlines is just as important. You can set an alarm on your phone, write it down in a physical planner, or add an alert to your digital calendar. The reminders will help to prevent things from slipping through the cracks during particularly hectic days.

Make sure you’ve allotted enough time to study for that big test or write that final paper. Time management is all about setting yourself up for success in advance and giving yourself the tools to accomplish tasks with confidence. 

# 3. Build a Personalized Schedule

Each person’s day-to-day is different and unique to them, so make sure your schedule works for you. Once you’ve accounted for consistent commitments such as classes or your shifts at work, add in study sessions, extracurriculars, chores and errands, and social engagements.

Consider your personal rhythm. If you typically start your day energized, plan to study or accomplish chores then. If you fall into an afternoon slump, give yourself that time to take a guilt-free TV break or see friends.

Having a schedule that works for you will help maximize your time. Plus, knowing exactly when your laundry day is or when your intramural volleyball practice is every week will help you avoid trying to cram everything in one day (or running out of clean socks!)

# 4. Use Tools That Work For You

Just like your calendar and schedule, the tools you use to keep you organized should be the right fit for you. Some students prefer physical planners and paper, while some prefer going totally digital. Your calendar can help you with long-term planning, but most of these tools are best for prioritizing from day to day.

Explore what best suits your needs with some of the following suggestions:

# Planners

Planners can help you keep track of long-term deadlines, such as important essay deadlines, upcoming exams, and appointments and meetings. They often provide a monthly overview each month, as well as day-to-day planning sections, so you can stay ahead. 

# Scheduling

If your schedule is jam-packed and you have trouble figuring out what to do and when, scheduling day by day — and sometimes even hour by hour — can help you slot in everything you need to do with less stress.

# Note Taking

From class to study sessions to errands, keeping track of everything can feel overwhelming. Keeping everything in one place, whether on the go or at your desk, can help keep you organized.

# 5. Prioritize

Sometimes there really is too much to do with too little time. In these instances, take just a few minutes to evaluate your priorities. Consider which deadlines are most urgent, as well as how much energy you have. 

If you are able to complete simple tasks first, try getting them out of the way before moving on to tasks that require a lot of focus. This can help to alleviate some of the pressure by checking a couple things off your to-do list without getting bogged down too early.

If you are struggling to fit everything in your schedule, consider what you can postpone or what you can simply say no to. Your friends will likely understand if you have to meet them for coffee another time in order to get in a final library session before a challenging exam. 

# 6. Make Time to Have Fun — And For Yourself

Time management isn’t just about getting work done. It’s also about ensuring that you can put yourself and your mental wellbeing first. Consistently including time for yourself in your schedule helps to keep your mental health and your life in balance. It can also be helpful to have things to look forward to when going through stressful periods.  

Whether it’s going for a bike ride along the river, spending time with your friends and family, or simply sleeping in on a Sunday, knowing you have space to relax and do things you enjoy can provide better peace of mind. 

# 7. Find Support 

Preparation and organization can sometimes only get you so far. Luckily, you have plenty of people rooting for your success. Keep yourself and your classmates on task by finding an accountability partner or study buddies. Remind your roommates when you need extra space to work on a paper. 

Your school’s academic resource center is also there to support you and point you in the right direction if you need additional help. Getting — and staying — organized is a collaborative effort and no one can do it on their own. 

# 8. Be Realistic and Flexible 

Sometimes unforeseen circumstances will come up or you simply may not be able to get to everything you set out to do in a given day. Be patient with yourself when things don’t go exactly to plan. When building your calendar, schedule, and priorities list, be realistic about what you can accomplish and include buffer time if you’re unsure. This can help to reduce obstacles and potential friction.

Time management isn’t just about sticking to a rigid schedule — it’s also about giving yourself space for change.",1,1763631796.0,StudentSecrets,0,1.0,False

An island is great for this, but even a small [breakfast bar ](https://www.goodbrother.ie/)can create a natural spot for chatting, snacking, or setting out dishes.

For the overall look, choose colours and materials that feel warm but still timeless. Soft neutrals, creamy whites, or gentle greens can make the space feel calm and welcoming. Pair them with sturdy countertops like quartz or a warm wood surface if you want something a little more rustic. A subtle patterned tile or textured backsplash can give the kitchen character without making it feel seasonal.

When it comes to appliances, focus on whatever will make holiday cooking simpler. A range with a large oven, a quiet but powerful dishwasher, or even a second small fridge for drinks can make hosting easier. If a full appliance upgrade isn’t part of the plan, small updates like new handles, better lighting, or freshly painted cabinets can still transform the space.

Think through storage carefully. Deep drawers for heavier cookware, shelves for baking tools, and hidden spots for small appliances can keep the counters clear when things get busy.

Totally normal night, nothing strange. The next morning, he suddenly asked if I would ever consider wearing a fake pregnancy belly. I thought he was joking, but he got weirdly shy and admitted he had a thing for pregnant women, more like the whole “caretaker” fantasy.

I don’t know why, maybe because it was already a messy, random night, but I said yes. He even had a silicone fake belly at his place (huge red flag or funny coincidence, depending on how you look at it). He asked if I’d wear it and just hang out with him for a bit. I did. He treated me like I was actually expecting his kid, carrying things for me, telling me to sit down, asking if I needed water every five minutes.

Before I left, he told me he know men who were into the same thing. Like a private little group, not official or anything, just guys who share this fantasy. And he asked if he could “recommend” me.

And now I basically get paid to put on a fake belly and meet these guys for a coffee, a walk, whatever. They want the whole pregnant-girlfriend vibe. Sometimes they ask me to carry something “too heavy” just so they can jump in and stop me. Or they hand me something on the floor so I have to struggle bending down, then rush over like I’m fragile. Once a guy even asked me to clean a little spot on his kitchen floor just to watch me try to kneel with the belly. It’s all about the scenario.

It’s ridiculous, but the money is good and honestly, ’s kind of harmless? Just awkward, intimate roleplay with overly helpful men. My friends think I’m doing normal side gigs. Nobody knows I’m walking around other citys with a silicone bump under my top, acting like I’m seven months along.

Hey, I know you probably don't want to talk to me again, but god I can't forgive myself for the way I tore our friendship apart. 

When you came into my life I was scared, never had I met this beautiful girl with such fantastic niches and eyes reminding me of a warm cup of coffee early in the morning. I bet you would have tasted better than coffee though. 

I should have been the person to put the band-aid on you. Tell you, ""Hey, it's okay, I am here"". I sat there and just dosed in my own world of despair and damage whilst you were shaking. I'm so sorry, I wanted to so bad but I let my broken brain block my heart's messages. 

My emotions were very complicated, and in my current headspace all I did was try to drag you down whilst I'm drowning. 

I am going to beat this stupid addiction because it has torn my personality to shreds, not only that but our friendship was next for the chopping block. I am left as a sad silhouette of a man whom was suppose to be ""societies' good samaritan"". I was going to become an engineer. Instead, I am a loser. 

I miss you, it's only been a few weeks but your smile, it was nothing like I had ever seen. You are so beautiful, you deserve a good guy in your life from what I learnt about you, what you told me and what lines I crossed to learn. 

I am going to get better, you are one of the reasons I am going to build myself into the man I need to be. ""A catalase"" god I fucking hate that term to give you. But, we can't talk. 

I am getting better for you, but for the wrong reason. I was suppose to get better with you, not because of you. 

I hope you reach out in a sometime, I know I deserved to be blocked. I just have no idea how to express what needs to be said in words. Because, it doesn't in words, does it? It was our minds yearning for eachother in the start, I ruined a chance to have eachother in our arms. Maybe that would have made has contempt in our lives, I know you were forbidden by age but honestly there was a moment I was about to jeopardise everything.

Well. This is me, the real me saying goodbye. Well, I think this is? I'm not sure there are a few people living in my head after all those stupid drugs. I played stupid little school games with you because I had no idea how to manage my emotions. 

Goodbye I guess, you'll always be special to me even if I'm not to you.

Looking for someone who’s also responsible, clean, and easy to live with. No drama, just good vibes and paying rent on time. Bonus if you also like iced coffee and Target runs.

If you’re interested, send me a quick intro about yourself + your socials so we can vibe check and start looking at places! 💛

For the last two years I've had brutal afternoon energy crashes. Around 2pm I'd hit a wall so hard I'd need a nap or I was useless.

I tried everything: Changed my diet (no sugar crashes, eating balanced meals), improved sleep hygiene (sleeping 7 to 8 hours consistently), added B vitamins, got my thyroid checked (levels normal), started exercising regularly.

Nothing worked. Still crashing every afternoon.

Then during my annual physical, my doctor asked: ""Walk me through a typical day. What do you eat and drink?""

Me: ""Coffee in the morning, maybe some tea, water at lunch sometimes, more coffee around 2...""

Her: ""How much actual water are you drinking?""

Me: ""I don't know. Enough?""

She made me track it for a week. Turns out: 30 to 40oz daily max. Most of it coffee or tea (which are mild diuretics).

For my body weight (152lbs) I needed at least 75oz daily.

Started tracking properly using WaterMinder with reminders. Set goal for 80oz. Front loaded mornings (20oz before coffee, another 20oz by 11am).

After 3 weeks:

Afternoon crashes reduced by maybe 70%. Still get tired but it's manageable, not debilitating.

Energy more consistent throughout the day. No dramatic peaks and valleys.

Headaches that I thought were normal? Gone.

Skin looks better as a bonus.

I feel stupid that something so simple made such a difference. I spent months trying complex solutions when the answer was basic hydration.

WaterMinder is nothing special. Just reminders and a progress tracker. But I needed that external accountability. Without it I'd forget to drink for 6 hours straight.

Anyone else discover hydration was the missing piece? I can't be the only one who overlooked something this basic.",6,1763630694.0,WomensHealth,0,1.0,False

Totally normal night, nothing strange. The next morning, he suddenly asked if I would ever consider wearing a fake pregnancy belly. I thought he was joking, but he got weirdly shy and admitted he had a thing for pregnant women, not necessarily sexual, more like the whole “caretaker” fantasy.

I don’t know why, maybe because it was already a messy, random night, but I said yes. He even had a silicone fake belly at his place (huge red flag or funny coincidence, depending on how you look at it). He asked if I’d wear it and just hang out with him for a bit. I did. He treated me like I was actually expecting his kid, carrying things for me, telling me to sit down, asking if I needed water every five minutes.

Before I left, he told me he know men who were into the same thing. Like a private little group, not official or anything, just guys who share this fantasy. And he asked if he could “recommend” me.

And now I basically get paid to put on a fake belly and meet these guys for a coffee, a walk, whatever. It’s never sexual, but it’s definitely fetish-adjacent. They want the whole pregnant-girlfriend vibe. Sometimes they ask me to carry something “too heavy” just so they can jump in and stop me. Or they hand me something on the floor so I have to struggle bending down, then rush over like I’m fragile. Once a guy even asked me to clean a little spot on his kitchen floor just to watch me try to kneel with the belly. It’s all about the scenario.

It’s ridiculous, but the money is good and honestly, ’s kind of harmless? Just awkward, intimate roleplay with overly helpful men. My friends think I’m doing normal side gigs. Nobody knows I’m walking around other citys with a silicone bump under my top, acting like I’m seven months along.",25,1763630647.0,confessions,13,0.93,False

Naturally I needed to make coffee so I relief on those papers, and knowing they like to stall I went 10 clicks coarser on my K6.

- Danche Red Honey by WatchHouse
- V60 02, 93c water
- 15g coffee, 210g water (1:14)
- 2x 30g blooms, at 0s and 30s, and one spiral pour to target weight
- 85 clicks for Abaca and 95 for Hario
- TBT around 2:15-2:20 for both recipes

The Abaca brew was good, but very slightly muted. I was going to adjust the recipe by decreasing agitation. To my surprise, the Hario produced a better cup that was a bit cleaner, with more pronounced flavour notes. Like it was really good, with flavour notes translating quite literally and no unpleasant harshness. The type of cup you’d be happy paying £10 for at a speciality cafe.

Trying to understand it now, is it possibly from the coarser grind? With the Abaca you need to go finer to get reasonable brew times, or if going coarser you need multiple pours which works well for things like 4:6. 

With the Hario I’m surprised it went even better. I was expecting a more hollow cup from grinding too coarse, but hey, glad I kept those papers around. I’ll now be doing side by side brews once my Abaca restock arrives, but I’ll be exploring this a bit more. ",2,1763630423.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

1p1ynou,/r/AtomicProductivity/comments/1p1ymsm/this_20minute_rule_tricks_your_brain_into_laser/,This 20-minute rule tricks your brain into laser focus and kills procrastination,"It’s wild how often we lie to ourselves about one thing: “I’ll just check Instagram for 1 minute before I start.” Next thing? It’s an hour later. Our brains crave comfort, not focus. I’ve seen this same pattern repeat with friends, coworkers, and in every productivity subreddit. The problem isn’t laziness. It’s friction. And most “productivity hacks” out there just throw more pressure at you without explaining how your brain actually works.

This post is for people who want to get things done without burning out. Everything here is backed by research, psychology books, and top productivity thinkers. Not flashy hacks from YouTubers yelling into a camera. This is the no-BS guide to understanding why we get distracted and how the 20-minute rule can retrain our mind. It’s way simpler than people think.

The core trick? You don’t need motivation. You need momentum. 

James Clear, author of Atomic Habits, explains that starting a task is often harder than completing it. The brain resists open loops. When you commit to just 20 minutes, you’re lowering the barrier of entry. This time constraint gives your brain a clear starting and stopping point, which reduces overwhelm. It’s why the Pomodoro Technique works but 20 minutes hits the right psychological sweet spot between too short to matter and long enough to make progress.

Studies from the American Psychological Association show that task initiation is one of the biggest hurdles for people with executive dysfunction. Starting small is the most evidence-based way to bypass procrastination. And the moment you start? Dopamine kicks in. You’re in motion. You start caring.

What’s interesting is how well this maps to a recent podcast with Andrew Huberman, who dives into the neuroscience of focus. He talks about this limbic friction, when your brain’s emotional resistance fights your logical goals. But if you reduce the friction (tiny time box, clear task), your brain lets you start.

Another overlooked reason why this 20-minute rule works is because it gives you permission to stop. That part is KEY. Telling yourself you can quit after 20 minutes makes your brain more open to starting. But most of the time, once those 20 minutes are up? You’re already in a flow state. You don’t want to stop.

This isn’t just a theory. It’s tied to something called the Zeigarnik Effect, our brain remembers uncompleted tasks better than completed ones. Once we start, we want to keep going. So the hardest part is always that first 1%. After that, your brain does the rest.

If you want to reinforce this new behavior, you can pair it with habit stacking. BJ Fogg, author of Tiny Habits and a Stanford behavior scientist, suggests linking new habits to existing routines. Like right after your morning coffee, start a 20-minute focus sprint. Same time, same trigger builds neural consistency.

Now, a game-changer? Make those 20 minutes feel enjoyable. Don’t treat it like punishment. Put on ambient music. Use a warm light. Create a focus ritual. The brain loves cues. That’s why tools that make learning or working feel good are so effective.

That brings me to some favorite resources that can pair with this approach:

Deep Work by Cal Newport 
Absolute classic. No fluff. Newport breaks down how focus is a skill that must be trained. He calls it “cognitive depth.” The best quote? “Clarity about what matters provides clarity about what does not.” If you’ve ever felt scattered, this book gives you structure to take your brain out of reactive mode.

Make Time by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky 
These ex-Google guys break down how to create laser focus in a world built for distraction. It’s insanely practical. Techniques like Highlighting your one most meaningful task per day work perfectly with the 20-minute rule. The tone is light but sharp. You’ll fly through this.

The Tim Ferriss Show (Podcast)
Ferriss interviews peak performers across fields. What’s useful here is the recurring theme: nearly all high achievers have some form of short, structured work bursts. From neuroscientists to athletes—they all shrink their work into defined units. Audio format makes it easy to absorb during walks or breaks.

Endel app
Sound is underrated as a productivity enhancer. Endel generates personalized focus soundscapes backed by neuroscience. It adapts to your time of day, heart rate, and even weather. Games your attention span without you realizing. Pairs so well with 20-minute sprints, especially if you want to avoid music with lyrics.

BeFreed 
This one’s a sleeper hit. BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app made by folks from Columbia University. It combines expert research, bestselling books, and podcast interviews into personalized audio lessons. You pick your topic like motivation, productivity, creative flow and the app builds a custom learning path that evolves as you use it. The best part? You can choose your host’s voice and tone. Mine sounds like a tough-love therapist with a late-night radio voice, not kidding. It even adjusts the lesson length depending on how deep you want to go. Most apps are static. This one learns from your patterns and sharpens over time. It also has audio summaries for all the books mentioned above. Makes deep learning effortless, especially if you’re short on time.

The real cheat code isn’t “discipline” or fancy trackers. It’s designing your environment and time windows so your brain doesn’t even need to resist. The 20-minute rule works because it turns work into play. You stop arguing with yourself. You stop waiting to feel ready.

And once you’re in motion, even for just 20 minutes, you’re already winning.

1p1yng4,https://www.reddit.com/r/FullOfBeans/comments/1p1yng4/creating_healthy_habits_in_college/,Creating healthy habits in college,"According to a 2016 study conducted by the University of Vermont, the “freshman 15” is actually a myth. In reality, most students gain around 10 pounds throughout all four years of college, with one-third of that weight gained in the first year. 

But weight gain is just one example of how young adults find their health compromised in college. When you mix being away from home for the first time with academic pressure from course loads and welcomed distractions that come with freedom, healthy habits supporting exercise, nutrition and mental health are often sacrificed. 

If you’re a student (or parent) looking for ways to work healthy habits into a busy college lifestyle, here’s some advice. 

# Try integrating workouts into your daily routine.

Most students have varying course schedules, such as Monday/Wednesday/Friday or Tuesday/Thursday classes. Combine this with study time and social schedules, and working out might end up being a low priority. It’s helpful if you can find ways to incorporate activity into your daily routine. For instance:

* Get a step counter or Fitbit. This is a great thing to ask for during the holidays or your birthday. Set some easy goals – 10,000 steps each day is standard – and find ways to meet them. Try taking the stairs to a third-floor classroom or give yourself extra time to take the long way to class. You can even park further away from campus. 
* Download a seven-minute workout app – and use it!
* Stow a couple of 5-10 pound dumbbells in your room. These don’t take up much space, and you can reach for them to do a few reps every 20 minutes or so during study sessions.
* You can purchase resistance bands, which can help with strength training. 
* Join a community/intramural sports team. Not only will you get some great exercise, you’ll likely make some new friends. Activities that are group-oriented, fun and/or built into a routine are easier to maintain. 

# Don’t overload your backpack.

If you’re overloading your body, all of the hard work adding fitness into your routine is wasted. If you’re carrying a lot of textbooks, ditch the messenger or cross-body bag and opt for a quality backpack with padded straps. Wear both straps so the weight of your pack is evenly distributed. 

Key technique: Load the heaviest items in your backpack toward your back and the lighter items farther out. Consider cleaning out your bag regularly to limit your load to just the essentials. These few extra minutes could help you avoid long-term back pain. 

# Study habits should support the mind and body.

The hardest part of studying is getting started – usually the first 15 minutes, to be specific. It can be difficult to study in a dorm room with so many distractions: your roommate, dirty laundry, dishes in the sink and much more. Your mind starts to wander, and you start to feel sleepy as you begin reading. 

Transforming your study space into a positive, productive environment can help shift wasted study time into something effective. For instance:

* Start with a clear, simple workspace – an uncluttered desktop, containers for office supplies, stacked notepads, etc. 
* Set some ground rules with your roommate when it comes to scheduling time for studying, cleaning or entertaining guests. 
* Consider alternating between sitting and standing for the first 15-20 minutes of study time, perhaps with the aid of a height-adjustable desk. Then transition to sitting for the next 20-30 minutes. You can create a pattern like this to help create natural breaks that can keep you alert.
* Buy a chair that supports good posture and enables movement. Like an adjustable height desk, an active sitting chair can provide the freedom of movement your body desires. 

# Don’t fight that catnap. 

Set an alarm and allow yourself a break! In fact, 10-15 minute naps are a great way to rest the mind and body. Studies show that frequent napping actually helps you retain more information. This is especially useful in avoiding cram-sessions where you’re exhausted, resulting in poor memory retention. 

Try placing a yoga mat next to your bed so you can stretch and do some yoga poses. If the mat doubles as an area rug, it’s more cost-effective!

# Change your scenery. 

Go to the library for a change in scenery or more quiet time. You can still incorporate some of these techniques in different settings.

# Eat like a pro. 

Avoiding weight gain is just one reason to eat well. When you eat well, you’re also helping your body build muscle and your brain focus better. In reality, between dining halls and lack of cooking skills, starting up a healthy diet can be tough. 

Start with this big rule of thumb: The less processed food, the better. The three main actions to consider are decreasing sugar intake, decreasing bad (saturated/trans) fats and increasing fruit/vegetable consumption. 

If you’re dependent on dining halls or meal plans, making healthier choices can be even more challenging. Check out Dr. Greger’s Daily Dozen app, which focuses on plant-based nutrition. The app allows you to tally up your protein, vitamins, fiber and much more to help ensure you’re getting enough of everything. This way, you can adjust your dining hall choices based on nutrition you’re missing for the day, instead of cravings. 

# Snack healthy. 

Consider these tips:

* Choose fruit and nut bars with no added sugars. 
* Start with plain popcorn and add seasoning, spray with olive oil and/or sprinkle in some cayenne or rosemary. 
* Bite-sized pieces of dark chocolate can curb a sweet tooth craving while adding a boost of caffeine and antioxidants.
* Eat your fruit wisely. Fresh berries and grapes should be eaten first.  Apples, oranges, pears and bananas are easy staples to grab and store. 
* You can get a lot of your daily nutrition from a smoothie! Nutrient-dense frozen fruits such as pineapple and berries are less expensive than fresh fruit, and available year-round. Pop them in a blender with some water/ice, a banana, and spinach or baby kale. Then add some peanut butter powder or plant-based protein powder. Voila! Now you have a great smoothie for a fraction of the cost of something similar from a chain store. 
* Pita chips and hummus are easy, healthy snack options. To make it even healthier and filling, try adding small sweet peppers or cucumber slices to the mix.
* You can sprinkle chia seeds into oatmeal, salads and smoothies, which will give you some omega 3s, fiber and vitamins. 

# Hydrate!

Try to get at least 64 ounces of water each day, possibly more depending on your weight and workout routine. 

Also, manage your caffeine intake. Coffee is typically the go-to drink, so be careful with sugar and fat content from cream. Consider green tea or guayusa tea instead – these options have less caffeine and are richer in antioxidants.

# Learn how to cook. 

Consider these tips:

* Online cooking classes (i.e. Rouxbe) make for a great gift and can help you lock down basic knife and food preparation skills. 
* Update a classic, staple recipe – like pasta with tomato sauce. Try choosing brown rice pasta or even edamame noodles in place of wheat noodles. For the sauce, look for a low-sodium jarred option at the store. If you want an ever heartier option, sauté some onions and peppers with chickpeas (or other protein source) and add it all to the sauce.
* Don’t skip breakfast! For a quick and easy breakfast, prepare overnight oats or use containers of stored oats so you can just add hot water. 

# Sleep!

Nothing can ruin your health more than sleep deprivation. Getting seven to nine hours of sleep each night helps you reset and repair your body, improves memory, replenishes energy and will boost your mood. To set yourself up for successful sleeping, consider these tips: 

* Create a sleep ritual. Start with decreasing blue light (smart phones, laptops, TV) before bed. 
* Try aromatherapy. A little bit of lavender or chamomile essences can help calm the mind and body after a long day. 
* Limit alcohol. One serving of alcohol can interrupt two hours of sleep. 
* Limit caffeine. It may take up to seven hours to metabolize just 50 percent of a caffeine serving.
* Say “no” to nicotine. In addition to its many other negative effects, nicotine can make it more difficult to fall asleep and causes frequent wakefulness throughout the night. 

# Manage your stress and watch for warning signs. 

Understanding and taking care of your body involves good nutrition and exercise, as we’ve discussed. It also involves taking care of your mind. Be aware of your thoughts. Negativity and “fault-finding” mentalities can depress your mood and bring physical stress and muscle tension. Lack of sleep, junk food and alcohol will dull your mental sharpness. Consider meditation for a few minutes throughout the day to relax your mind and body. Try these:

* Deepak Chopra’s “The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success.” In college, students typically have a set career focus in mind. Some don’t, and many change their minds. This is OK. Chopra’s book is a classic, and it might help you clarify your motivation. 
* Breathing exercises can calm you down in stressful situations or help your brain turn off for sleep. Andrew Weil’s 4-7-8 breathing technique is a great place to start. 

Knowing the signs and symptoms of anxiety and depression can help you recognize when college it taking a toll on your mental health. It can also help you identify other friends who might need some help. Look for:

* Restlessness or feeling “on edge”
* Difficulty concentrating
* Muscle tension
* Sleep disturbance
* Depressed mood for most of the day, feelings of sadness or hopelessness
* Markedly decreased interest for most or all activities 
* Significant weight loss or gain
* Feelings of worthlessness
* Loss of energy
* Recurrent thoughts of death or self-harm



# Find the recreation and health centers.

For a good workout, find your campus recreation or fitness center. To stay on top of your health, don’t stop until you find a health center. Learn more about the signs of serious illnesses, and make sure these vaccinations are up to date:

* Meningococcal vaccine
* Human papillomavirus vaccine
* Tetanus booster
* Flu vaccine (annual)

# Get involved. 

Community involvement expands your horizons, helps you learn more and gets you out of your comfort zone. Consider volunteering to tutor at-risk students or build homes through Habitat for Humanity. Join different campus clubs and meet people from different backgrounds. You might learn new perspectives and find out just how much you have in common with others. ",1,1763630164.0,FullOfBeans,0,1.0,False

1p1ymsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtomicProductivity/comments/1p1ymsm/this_20minute_rule_tricks_your_brain_into_laser/,This 20-minute rule tricks your brain into laser focus and kills procrastination,"It’s wild how often we lie to ourselves about one thing: “I’ll just check Instagram for 1 minute before I start.” Next thing? It’s an hour later. Our brains crave comfort, not focus. I’ve seen this same pattern repeat with friends, coworkers, and in every productivity subreddit. The problem isn’t laziness. It’s friction. And most “productivity hacks” out there just throw more pressure at you without explaining how your brain actually works.

This post is for people who want to get things done without burning out. Everything here is backed by research, psychology books, and top productivity thinkers. Not flashy hacks from YouTubers yelling into a camera. This is the no-BS guide to understanding why we get distracted and how the 20-minute rule can retrain our mind. It’s way simpler than people think.

The core trick? You don’t need motivation. You need momentum. 

James Clear, author of Atomic Habits, explains that starting a task is often harder than completing it. The brain resists open loops. When you commit to just 20 minutes, you’re lowering the barrier of entry. This time constraint gives your brain a clear starting and stopping point, which reduces overwhelm. It’s why the Pomodoro Technique works but 20 minutes hits the right psychological sweet spot between too short to matter and long enough to make progress.

Studies from the American Psychological Association show that task initiation is one of the biggest hurdles for people with executive dysfunction. Starting small is the most evidence-based way to bypass procrastination. And the moment you start? Dopamine kicks in. You’re in motion. You start caring.

What’s interesting is how well this maps to a recent podcast with Andrew Huberman, who dives into the neuroscience of focus. He talks about this limbic friction, when your brain’s emotional resistance fights your logical goals. But if you reduce the friction (tiny time box, clear task), your brain lets you start.

Another overlooked reason why this 20-minute rule works is because it gives you permission to stop. That part is KEY. Telling yourself you can quit after 20 minutes makes your brain more open to starting. But most of the time, once those 20 minutes are up? You’re already in a flow state. You don’t want to stop.

This isn’t just a theory. It’s tied to something called the Zeigarnik Effect, our brain remembers uncompleted tasks better than completed ones. Once we start, we want to keep going. So the hardest part is always that first 1%. After that, your brain does the rest.

If you want to reinforce this new behavior, you can pair it with habit stacking. BJ Fogg, author of Tiny Habits and a Stanford behavior scientist, suggests linking new habits to existing routines. Like right after your morning coffee, start a 20-minute focus sprint. Same time, same trigger builds neural consistency.

Now, a game-changer? Make those 20 minutes feel enjoyable. Don’t treat it like punishment. Put on ambient music. Use a warm light. Create a focus ritual. The brain loves cues. That’s why tools that make learning or working feel good are so effective.

That brings me to some favorite resources that can pair with this approach:

Deep Work by Cal Newport 
Absolute classic. No fluff. Newport breaks down how focus is a skill that must be trained. He calls it “cognitive depth.” The best quote? “Clarity about what matters provides clarity about what does not.” If you’ve ever felt scattered, this book gives you structure to take your brain out of reactive mode.

Make Time by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky 
These ex-Google guys break down how to create laser focus in a world built for distraction. It’s insanely practical. Techniques like Highlighting your one most meaningful task per day work perfectly with the 20-minute rule. The tone is light but sharp. You’ll fly through this.

The Tim Ferriss Show (Podcast)
Ferriss interviews peak performers across fields. What’s useful here is the recurring theme: nearly all high achievers have some form of short, structured work bursts. From neuroscientists to athletes—they all shrink their work into defined units. Audio format makes it easy to absorb during walks or breaks.

Endel app
Sound is underrated as a productivity enhancer. Endel generates personalized focus soundscapes backed by neuroscience. It adapts to your time of day, heart rate, and even weather. Games your attention span without you realizing. Pairs so well with 20-minute sprints, especially if you want to avoid music with lyrics.

BeFreed 
This one’s a sleeper hit. BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app made by folks from Columbia University. It combines expert research, bestselling books, and podcast interviews into personalized audio lessons. You pick your topic like motivation, productivity, creative flow and the app builds a custom learning path that evolves as you use it. The best part? You can choose your host’s voice and tone. Mine sounds like a tough-love therapist with a late-night radio voice, not kidding. It even adjusts the lesson length depending on how deep you want to go. Most apps are static. This one learns from your patterns and sharpens over time. It also has audio summaries for all the books mentioned above. Makes deep learning effortless, especially if you’re short on time.

The real cheat code isn’t “discipline” or fancy trackers. It’s designing your environment and time windows so your brain doesn’t even need to resist. The 20-minute rule works because it turns work into play. You stop arguing with yourself. You stop waiting to feel ready.

And once you’re in motion, even for just 20 minutes, you’re already winning.

I’ve been trying to follow the 10-3-2-1-0 rule for a while, and it took ages for the habits to settle in. At one point I was literally creating calendar events just to remind myself.

The biggest game-changer has been the “no caffeine 10 hours before bed” rule.
Since using the app, I’ve been completing that milestone earlier each day and limiting myself to two coffees in the morning, and I’ve noticed a huge difference in how quickly I fall asleep.

If I could give one piece of advice for anyone trying to improve their sleep:

- cut back on caffeine and stop drinking it at least 10 hours before you go to bed. It’s a bigger win than people expect.

And if you want something that keeps you on track, I made Sleep Streak for exactly that 😁

If you’re pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sciences, you also benefit from advising services to help you transition into the next phase of your career.

Read on to explore six healthy, productive habits that can help you be more successful at Penn LPS Online, at home, and at work. Discover how to stay motivated and create a new routine for self-improvement; it's a very personal experience, so keep in mind that the suggestions below can be customized to support your unique lifestyle and goals.

# 1. Develop a set morning routine

Starting the morning off on the right foot can have a huge impact on your motivation, productivity, and stress levels for the rest of the day. Although it can be extremely tempting to reach for coffee as soon as you get up, try getting into the habit of drinking a full glass of water first. Doing so is a quick and effective way to rehydrate your body after 7-8 hours of sleep, and it may also help jumpstart your metabolism. Then feel free to have that coffee or tea.

It's highly likely that you have many responsibilities to deal with in the morning, whether that involves making breakfast for your kids, getting ready for work, or walking the dog. But before you tackle them, try to take 5 to 10 minutes for some self-care. What you decide to do with this time is completely up to you, as long as it doesn’t involve scrolling through social media or checking your email. It can be as simple as making your bed, decluttering your study space, practicing a deep breathing exercise, or writing in your journal.

You can also set yourself up for success the night before by taking care of some of your usual morning chores. Do the laundry, set out your work clothes, make your oatmeal, or pack a lunch for your kids—anything that can lessen your obligations will help to make your mornings less stressful and more enjoyable. If you’re not already a morning person, you may grow to be one!

# 2. Set a priority list for your studies

When you’re juggling multiple responsibilities, it can be tough to stay organized and on-task. That’s why it’s important to create daily study goals to help ensure your priorities are in check. An effective way to do so is by using the SMART approach wherein you ensure that your goals are specific, measurable, relevant, attainable, and timely. Wondering how to increase motivation? When you make and fulfill daily SMART goals, you also may attain added benefits such as reduced anxiety alongside stronger focus and motivation.

Examples of SMART study goals include:

1. Spending 30 minutes to finish an assigned reading for the next day
2. Completing research for a paper that is due in 2 weeks
3. Meeting online with your peers for 15 minutes to discuss a group project
4. Emailing your instructor with questions about an upcoming assignment
5. Using your lunch break to create an outline for a writing assignment

Keep in mind that your daily priority list is not the same thing as your study schedule, which should lay out the due dates for your projects, quizzes, and exams for your courses on a macro level. Instead, you need to think on a micro level and ask yourself, “What do I need to do today to ensure that I’m on track in my studies?” If it’s helpful, you can also include your work and personal responsibilities, since the goal is to ensure that you fulfill them all to the best of your ability.

# 3. Ensure you get enough sleep

If you want to succeed academically, it’s important to take care of your physical health. A huge component of that involves getting enough sleep every night. Work, academic, and personal stressors can create anxiety, preventing your brain from relaxing once you hit the pillow. Here are 4 steps you can take to help increase the chances of getting a restful sleep:

1. **Stick to a sleep schedule:** Whenever possible, go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time every day and resist the urge to sleep in on the weekends. If you can’t fall asleep within a reasonable amount of time, get up and listen to music or read until you’re tired enough to go back to bed. Avoid naps longer than 30 minutes, as they can disrupt your sleep at night.
2. **Avoid blue light exposure:** Electronic devices like smartphones and computers emit blue light, which disrupts your circadian rhythm, making your body think it’s daytime. Stop watching T.V. and dim the lights a couple of hours before bed. If you must use electronics, invest in glasses that block blue light.
3. **Pay attention to your food and drink:** It’s best not to go to bed hungry or too full, as the resulting discomfort may prevent sleep. If possible, have nighttime snacks and drinks at least 1 to 2 hours before bed. Both caffeine and alcohol are also disruptive to your sleep, so try to limit your intake in the evening.
4. **Create a comfortable environment:** For most people, a cool, dark, and quiet room is ideal for sleeping. If this doesn’t describe your bedroom, consider using blackout curtains, a noise machine, or earplugs. If you can’t control the room temperature, a fan can help cool things off while also offering some ambient noise.

# 4. Eat healthy and stay active

It’s time to take stock of how you’re fueling and moving your body. If you find yourself reaching for sugar or caffeine to keep you going, then consider making some changes. A fiber-rich diet, which includes whole grains, vegetables, legumes, and fruits, can help you feel fuller longer. Try to include color and variety when choosing fruits and veggies, like yellow, orange, red, purple, and dark green produce. Beans, fish, poultry, and nuts are great sources of protein and contain healthy fats, which the brain needs to function correctly.

Exercise is also important for both your body and your mind, but getting your body moving doesn’t necessarily mean spending hours in the gym. It does involve setting aside time during the day, whether that’s 15 or 50 minutes, to take a walk or run, fit in a bike ride, or play your favorite sport. The key is finding the activities that you enjoy and integrating them into your schedule. The benefits of exercise include:

1. Stress release
2. Improved mood
3. Enriched sleep
4. Enhanced energy
5. Lowered blood pressure
6. Increased cognitive function

If you find it difficult to make physical activity a priority, you may want to try a strategy called habit stacking. In his book *Atomic Habits*, author James Clear explains the process, which involves adding a new habit—in this case, exercise—onto an existing habit that is already ingrained into your routine. For example, while you’re waiting for your coffee to brew in the morning you can fit in some sit-ups or push-ups. Or, while you’re making your breakfast you can get in your aerobics by dancing around the kitchen. The point is to do what works best for you to help build productive habits that last.

# 5. Practice healthy coping strategies

It’s virtually impossible to be successful in your studies if you are perpetually stressed out. Excessive worry can cause issues such as irregular sleep, headaches, loss of interest, inability to concentrate, and poor memory retention. And when your stress is coming from one facet of your life such as your career or a relationship, it can bleed into areas such as your education. That’s why it’s important to develop coping mechanisms to help you deal with stress more effectively.

Although it may seem counterintuitive, if you’re stressed out about your course load, one of the best ways to relax is to engage in a hobby that brings you joy. Whether that involves gardening, painting, journaling, or hitting some golf balls will vary depending on your personal interests. What’s important is that you get into a state wherein you’re fully engaged in your activity, which can help lower stress *and* your heart rate.

In high-pressure situations, it can also be helpful to connect with your loved ones. If you can do it face-to-face (or screen-to-screen), that’s even better. Talking with a partner, friend, or family member who you trust can help ground you and quell the unfounded fears or anxieties that you’re holding on to. And don’t discount the value of spending time with your pet! Research has shown petting a dog can lower the stress hormone cortisol and increase levels of oxytocin, a feel-good hormone.

It can also be beneficial to practice relaxation techniques, including:

1. Mindfulness mediation
2. Progressive muscle relaxation
3. 4-7-8 deep breathing
4. Guided imagery
5. Restorative or Yin yoga
6. Gratitude practice

# 6. Schedule time for breaks and fun

You likely have many motivating factors for enhancing your education at Penn LPS Online. Whether your goals include advancing your career, pivoting to a new industry, or pursuing your intellectual passions, it’s important to remember that you still need to take time for yourself. That includes taking breaks when you’re studying. This is particularly true when you’re balancing work, family, and personal commitments you can’t allow to fall by the wayside.

The good news is that scheduling time for purposeful breaks may increase your productivity, energy, and ability to focus. You can also try setting up a reward system for meeting your daily priority list for your coursework. When it comes to how to increase motivation, having something to look forward to and celebrating your small victories can have a positive impact on your morale, drive, and overall happiness. Think about the types of rewards that would best help give you an extra lift. Maybe it’s trying a new restaurant, watching a movie, catching a game on TV, or planning a vacation.

Establishing a routine of healthy habits takes work, but getting started is often the hardest part. There will likely be times you will falter and have the urge to give up entirely. That’s when it’s critical to cut yourself some slack, refocus, and get back on track. Remember all that you’ve accomplished so far, why you’re committed to earning an Ivy League education, and everything you look forward to in the future as a result.

# What to do if you fall off track

Even with the best intentions and routines, setbacks happen; life gets busy, stress builds, or motivation wanes. The key is to respond with self-compassion rather than criticism. Instead of focusing on what went wrong, try to identify small, manageable steps to reestablish your momentum.

Ask yourself: What habit made the biggest difference when I was feeling motivated? Can I reintroduce just one practice today, even if only for five minutes? Reframing your goals to be flexible and realistic can help you stay engaged without feeling overwhelmed. Don’t be afraid to revisit your original “why”—the purpose behind your habits—as a powerful reminder of what you’re working toward.",1,1763629886.0,Smart_Hacks,0,1.0,False

I'm a little hesitant to post here but I think it is the case with all of the students. I'm also a student and I have to travel a lot because of studies and I also love travelling. But every time I find myself searching on Google 'is this place safe to go' and I end up with generic reviews and years old threads. There is not a single method to know is place is actually safe and should I visit. This is the case with almost all students who leave their home town for studies.

I remember during my first year I skipped plans because most of my friends were day scholars and I don't want to come back my pg alone . I was so literally so frustrated and have to come back to my pg before 7 most of the times. Every time I want to explore somewhere new or plan a trip, it's the same anxiety: checking five different sources, asking random people, still not knowing for sure. I don't have a big friend group just me and my 2 friends and that's why it still a problem for us!

Here's what I realized: nobody tracks the information that actually matters for solo travelers especially women. Not which cafe has good coffee, but whether you'll get harassed walking there alone at 7 PM.

Therefore I'm building a product called Safe or Not, it is a very simple product just type in the location and get women safety, transit safety etc. reviews from crowdsource data. You also have access to latest scams and recent news so you don't have to juggle between posts.

But I need your support to build this community. Here is the link!

Do you guys have any recommendations or tips?

Gyeongseong Ilbo (Keijō Nippo) March 20, 1943

**Over One Hundred Selected Records**  
**The First Spear in Sweeping Away American and British Music**  
**Mr. Kawamoto Immediately Goes to the Military Government Office**

Chief Dōmoto of the Information Section recently made a forceful statement: *“Now is the time to drive out from our homes and our streets the American- and British-made jazz and demonic music that whip up the noise of the city and drive madness into the very marrow of people’s brains!”* The web of ideological subversion that spreads through cultural channels cannot be cut in a single day. The harmful influence of American- and British-style records is one such danger.

Rising to the call, declaring “*We must eradicate this demonic music without fail*…,” is Mr. Kawamoto Ishiiwa (age 39), owner of Seoul Café in front of Seoul Station, known as a “Western-music coffeehouse.” On March 19th, the very day of Chief Dōmoto’s statement, he immediately went to the shelves holding the numerous Western-music records stored in his shop and selected over one hundred American- and British-type records, including parts of *The Foster Collection*, *Dvořák’s New World Symphony*, *Hawaiian Jazz*, and *World Folk Songs*, and decided to proceed with the donation process through the Military Government Office. On March 19th, Mr. Kawamoto spoke:

“As you can see, I have collected Western-music records extensively as a hobby, so there are many. Even sorting out the American and British records will take several days. But I also have many works by musical saints of the Axis nations, like Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, and Italy’s Verdi, so there is no shortage of wholesome entertainment. At this opportunity, I intend to sweep out all American and British records entirely and donate the whole lot.”

\[Photo: Mr. Kawamoto donating hostile-nation records\]

Gyeongseong Ilbo (Keijō Nippo) May 16, 1943

**Collection of Hostile-Nation Records**

\[Miryang\] In the town (*eup*), in order to heighten hostility toward the enemy and strengthen the movement to reject enemy nations under the wartime system, it has been announced that all records from enemy nations, America and Britain, will be collected. This includes Japanese-language and Korean-language records whose musical content is deemed unhealthy or unsuitable for performance in the present circumstances. The goal is to sweep them all away and elevate the people’s fighting spirit toward certain victory, urging each member of the [League of Mobilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Mobilization_in_Korea) to voluntarily contribute such materials.

The notice provides:

▲ Patriotic Group Leaders are to survey in advance the American- and British-made records possessed by each member of their group.

▲ Patriotic Group Leaders are to gather the records submitted by each member and bring them collectively to the Town (*eup*) League.

▲ Care must be taken not to damage records that fall under the contribution requirement. In view of material shortages at this time, used records are also to be thoroughly collected as part of resource recovery.

hi, this is my first time practicing witchcraft and I would love some insights on my first ritual, i know it's baneful

I have been doing my studying and research for the past one month so I can be sure of what I'm doing is correct and right but I would love to get opinions from practicing and experienced witches.

**step one timing**
I have been reading about which days to practice and moon phases. I have also been reading which phase works better for me and my spell whether it's waxing or waning and since I want his misery to grow, I assume a new moon or a waxing phase is better. 20 November was a new moon but it was a Thursday and Thursdays are usually for wealth abundance luck so I decided to wait for two more days and do the spell on *Saturday instead, which would have the moon and a waxing phase during the hour of mars or hour of Saturn*

**Step two cleansing**
About this I've read that there are various and multiple ways to cleanse yourself and your space. Since I have never practiced witchcraft before this would be a new place and I would have to choose my place properly. I do not have any alter. I have chosen a room upstairs, which is empty (is this a good thing because this room has not been in use for 15 years and I plan on coming upstairs whenever I wanna practice. should I rather pick a place where there is human interaction where I would be around more frequently or will an empty space that has not been in use for the past 15 years a good thing? would it attract more negative energy?) I plan on cleansing my area, using *white sage and sound*. after that, i plan on drawing a circle using salt where i would be practicing my ritual. 

**Step three divination**
I plan on using white candles to ask myself the questions and use pendulum's and tarot cards to seek answers

**Step four ritual**
I plan on creating a sour jar for my ex. i'm not exactly sure on how to start with the ritual and I've been trying to research. I would love to hear on how exactly to perform the ritual. How should I start? Are there any chants I need to say and the procedure of it. Here is the list of ingredients i plan on using in my sour jar. 

- Alum powder (some say it's for protection but some say it's to make the other person stink)
- chilli flakes (agitation)
- cigerette buds and ashes (bad habits, decay)
- asafetida 
- pins x9
- rusty nails x9
- cayenne powder (irritation)
- pepper
- cat shit
- expired medicines (for him to get sick like he used to make me (std))
- mustard seeds (chaos)
- broken glass (shattered illusions)
- coffee (restlessness)
- my urine (for dominance)
- sulphur
- moldy strawberries x3 to ruin his next love life
- glitter
- aluminum foil shiny side in for reflection
- poppy seeds for confusion
- jojoba oil
- drawn pentacles of saturn and mars

i will write his name and birth date thrice on a brown paper and fold is against me. i also have his used condom as a tag lock. and proceed to add these ingredients. some say you need to add them while saying their intended use. i'm not sure of the uses of some so if anyone can help me out, id gladly appreciate it. 
i plan on sealing all of it using a black candle with his name carved nine times and shaking the jar every day for seven days before keeping it away somewhere dark

**step five protection**
i plan on taking a salt shower. where i live, i dont really have access to a lot of herbs and crystals, so i make do with what i have at home or can find in grocery stores. if there are any other ways i can protect myself, please do let me know

You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

(I wasn't sure when I'd be able to find another coffee)

At home, I drink a lot of coffee it's basically a religion.

Two steps out of the hotel, bam a cafe with coffee.  

So I stopped there because, who knows when I'd find another coffee place, and wanted to try the difference between the hotel coffee and a cafe.

Bam, my taste buds smashed, with a more delicious cup of coffee.  Saigon iced this time.

Dark, rich, sweet, chocolaty all the notes where there.

Suddenly my fingers started tingling, palms sweaty, beads of sweat swelling on my forehead.

I asked for the bill and left...

For about 15 minutes I was at a near half run moving aimlessly through saigon.  The world appeared as if I were looking through a fisheye lens.

I could hear my veines swelling of caffeine, almost like leaves blowing across concrete.

Thrump, thrump, thrump.

Damn, this shit is strong... I mumbled to myself.

I meanderd around looking at the sites getting a feel for the city.

Until I started to feel like myself again.  But without that caffeine I was dragging.

So again I stopped.  By this time I realized their a cafe every 5 meters.   You can't miss, kinda like a homless person in Portland Oregon.

I ordered an egg coffee, because why not?  No sooner had the mug left my lips that my cheeks were aching with the joy of a creme bruleish flavour with... You guessed it, another coffee injection.

That all to familiar and now we'll received caffeine pulsing injection my body was aching for.

So a few weeks of traveling and drinking Avery coffee Vietnam had to offer.

I get up and make myself some coffee... A pour over v60 with one of my favourite arabica beans...

I brewed it, put it to my lips... And nothing.

My heart sank, oh, right maybe I'm drinking hot water, I forgot to brew the coffee in my sleepy morning ritual.

I looked down... Damit, I was drinking coffee.

But it was tasteless, weak and worthless.

Now... I'm stuck drinking what can only be described as burnt water...

Waiting until my phin filter and condonesed milk with dark roast arrives by mail, before I can feel like myself again...

It’s been over 20 years of ups and downs. A seemingly never-ending rollercoaster ride from hell himself. So many days of questioning my existence and where it fits within this world, and so many nights of crying. Crying to feel relief, crying out of frustration to things deemed imperfect or flawed within me, or crying out a lullaby of my own custom-tuned plea wanting out of the daily internal madness. It has only been in the last few years of being proactive in outwardly seeking self-improvement that I was labeled borderline by a doctor. Now I have a name for the mayhem. But a diagnosis is a name, and a name is not a cure. I’ve been labeled, branded like so many others, now what?...what now?

9:45 am, I wake up in the morning and feel fine. An influx of phone calls about this appointment, that errand, deadline for a bill reminder, all begin to feel like a pressure cooker with the lid on too tight. A misinterpreted text from my man royally pissed me off now and has me questioning whether I even want to be in this relationship anymore or does he even love me like he says every day? Are we even in a relationship at this point. Spiraling out over random pointless shit in hindsight. Like why tf is the tv remote never where I can just find it, why is there a granola box in the pantry with nothing in this mf’er, and why on Gods earth do I see yet another coffee stain on my tile floor. Can anything go right in my day.

Coping skills are giving 3 out of 10 at best sometimes. It is in fact the end of the world.

Let’s go get the errands done for the day. Hung up on my man during an argument mid-sentence in the car while driving to said errand because remember, this morning out the blue he decides to end his text with this brand new emoji I’ve never seen him use before. Idk, that little bald-headed yellow face was a little too “indifferent” looking as thee face to choose to send me. Is he fucking playing with me? I was just having a fine morning, and there he goes.

Three minutes later, one of my favorite songs starts playing on the queue. I blast it, singing word for word. Catch a glimpse of myself in the rearview mirror, “ok sunglasses, the shirt choice actually looks cute today” “Come through, yes, period, love that for me.” All the things. In that moment and thereafter, I don’t remember that I was sad about the text or the looming apocalypse over everything else gone wrong. Life is great, life is perfect, I am literally at the greatest party of 1 right now. I can accomplish all things if I want to. Fuck all the bullshit, nothing and no one matters. I am the Patron Saint of Euphoria. Yep.

At the grocery store. Oooh, you know what would be nice? I see steak strips on sale, I’m gonna stir fry it with some vegetables, he’ll love that. Let me get this international brand of lager beer while I’m here, I love trying new things. “What are those called? These baby blue flowers are so beautiful,” I said to myself as I was headed to the cash register. I have to have them; they’ll look so good just to stare at on the kitchen island back home.

Errands done, dinner’s ready, remote is found, granolas restocked, coffee stain sanitized. He comes home, understandably still a little sour from the blowup earlier. I’m not mad anymore; reasoning and rationale took the driver’s seat hours ago. I forgot actually, I just want him to do the same. That shit feels like 3 days ago in my realm of time. But, I am sorry for my behavior. I want him to relax, I want to love him, I want to spoon-feed him, wipe the corn that caught on his beard with a napkin. I want to know all about his day. I want to smother him. I want to give him space.

Night falls, something boring begins to play on tv. This looming dread begins to creep in my veins. An itch under my skin that is begging to be clawed out, to be cracked open like a fortune cookie with a note that reads, “Is this all there is to life?”. My random existential crisis of a question. I’m now down the Alice in Wonderland rabbit hole of thoughts. Let’s do something random, I can pack my shit right now and go be a pro race car driver off the coast of Italy. Right?

Nah, a few channels later this really good psych thriller movie from the 90’s starts to play and I’m cozy and content just where I’m at.

Halfway through the movie and now I’m preoccupied with the urge to be fucked taken, man-handled, consumed, I want to be out of my mind. Literally. And the show begins. Curtain closes and I pass out. It is my choice of poison always.

My days can be tamer or more extreme than this example of course.

I also know this “disorder” is the thing that may very well be the spark that keeps my relationship going. He loves me because I never get boring to him. He’s been with so many different women. They just all happen to be different versions of 1 person, me. His wife, his whore, his hard to get. The benefactor of altering. Blah blah blah.

I used to wish I could be bipolar. So then I could deal with my emotions 1 day or days at a time. Yes, let me be on a high for days and weeks and enjoy that 1 emotion. Let me be sad for a full 24 hours so I can saturate in the feeling and give myself the chance to figure out why and deal with it.

I don’t think this way anymore. Instead, acceptance and re-routing of how I view this thing, how I view me and others like me, anything can be a superpower, not a scarlet letter.

To feel everything and nothing at all, all the time, is something I have come to terms with.",1,1763628647.0,BPD,1,1.0,False

1p1y7z8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p1y7z8,10 days trip in South Korea as an Indian,"Hi everyone 🙋‍♀️
I recently completed my 10 days trip in South Korea (Seoul & Busan) and wanted to share some points that I found interesting (general and tourist attraction wise):

General ones ⬇️

1️⃣No toothpaste/toothbrush in Hotels - You can bring your own or purchase it there from any convenience store.
2️⃣Amount of coffee shops in Seoul - I was amazed at the amount of coffee shops in Seoul. You can see one every 10-20 steps. Great for coffee lovers.
3️⃣Bumpy bus rides - This might just be me, but I felt the buses were extra bumpy/bouncy. First day a Korean man fell after boarding the bus as it started with an aggressive jerk. I felt like we really needed to maintain our balance in order to save ourselves from falling over.
4️⃣Smaller pet dogs - I usually saw people walking smaller dogs like Chihuahua/shih tzu etc. Big dogs were a rarity. 
5️⃣ Keychains - Almost everyone has one or two keychain in their bags, different kinds, colourful, looks cute.

Tourist attractions ⬇️

1️⃣ Gyeongbokgung Palace - Honestly I felt you would enjoy this place more if you are dressing up traditionally and clicking photographs, while from a travelling perspective I found Deoksugung Palace more  beautiful.
2️⃣ Namsan Tower - This was a good experience and I suggest taking tickets for the observatory too as the views from top are beautiful (specially since I went during autumn the foliage view was really nice)
3️⃣ DMZ tour - Everything was good, but I didn’t find the tunnel experience that great. It was a longggg walk with really nothing to see. I felt that it could have been skipped but this might be a controversial opinion as people want to experience that. But I suggest if someone is claustrophobic/has bad knees or lungs issue pls avoid it. Somehow our tour guide didn’t tell this but I feel this should be given as an advisory.
4️⃣ Noppensan - If you like Chai, this place is a must visit. They have authentic masala chai and even bun maska in the menu. Also, their unique concept of “chai spread” was really nice. 

Lastly, here are some pics from the trip 📸",29,1763628474.0,koreatravel,3,0.86,False

1p1y7bd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p1y7bd,Sharp Eyes! Goyard Hobo Bag Authenticity Guide | Ultimate Collection👀🌟🌟,"
For those who have bought or want to buy a Goyard Hobo bag (commonly known as the ""dog tooth bag""), read on! Counterfeits are rampant on the market - learn these tips to easily avoid pitfalls. This guide combines multiple high-definition comparison images to teach you how to distinguish real from fake, from the outside in!

1. Instant Recognition: Overall Appearance and Pattern
• Color Tone: The authentic bag's chevron pattern features understated, vintage colors, such as the classic deep coffee/milk white combination, with an overall calm and muted tone. Counterfeits often get the colors wrong - either too bright and harsh or dull and lifeless.
• Core ""Y"" Pattern: This is the most crucial authentication point!
◦ Authentic: The intersection points of the Y letters have a natural ink bleed effect, like slight ink overflow. From a distance, the pattern appears dense; up close, each Y is clear and three-dimensional with a textured feel.
◦ Counterfeit: Y patterns are often blurry and smudged together, appearing as flat printing without dimension, with a smooth surface.
• Body Letters: The ""GOYARD"", ""HONORE"" lettering on authentic bags features a unique graffiti style with varying stroke thickness. Close inspection reveals tiny ink bubbles and black spots. Counterfeit letters often have poor proportion and rigid printing.

2. Touch Test: Material and Craftsmanship
• Canvas Material (Goyardine Canvas):
◦ Authentic: Uses specially formulated coated canvas with a soft, slightly matte texture. Close inspection reveals clear underlying textile weave and irregular dye spots, with excellent durability.
◦ Counterfeit: Canvas texture is usually stiff or rough, with rigid pattern and spot treatment lacking the authentic's unique character.
• Leather Parts (e.g., Handles):
◦ Authentic: Handles use grained cowhide with fine, natural texture and a plump, slightly raised surface. Stitching is neat, often matching the leather color (e.g., reddish-brown).
◦ Counterfeit: Leather has strong grain but blurry texture, rough edges, and possibly overly thick or mismatched thread (e.g., light-colored or black thread).

3. Detail Decides: Hardware Accessories
• Zipper:
◦ Authentic: Zipper pull has a premium matte finish with finely chamfered ""G"" logo, sliding smoothly.
◦ Counterfeit: Cheap metallic finish with possible defects, noticeable stickiness when zipping.
• Buttons/Hardware Clasps:
◦ Authentic: ""GOYARD PARIS"" engraving on circular buttons is clear and precise. All hardware edges are finely polished, with visible打磨 marks inside and no burrs.
◦ Counterfeit: Engraving may be blurry or incorrect font. Rough edges with visible burrs.

4. Inner Beauty: Interior Labels and Lining
• Interior Stamp: Authentic brand stamps have even depth, proper letter spacing - clear but not obtrusive. Counterfeit stamps are often too deep or shallow with cramped letter spacing.
• Serial Number: Authentic serial numbers are typically on the end of the inner pocket strap, clearly legible. Counterfeit serial numbers are often blurry.
• Lining Material: Authentic linings use high-quality materials with soft, comfortable cotton feel. Counterfeit linings are usually粗糙 in texture.

Authenticity identification requires comprehensive judgment by observing multiple points. Authentic craftsmanship shows in every detail's refinement and overall harmony, while counterfeits always reveal flaws in some aspect. Hope this guide helps everyone!

1p1y5zb,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1p1y5zb/sharing_my_experience_of_operating_a_factory_in/,Sharing my experience of operating a FACTORY in BinhDuong as a Foreigner.,"Hello guys, i want to share my experience of operating a FACTORY in BinhDuong Vietnam, as a foreigner. You might don’t know where is BinhDuong, it is in the northeast of HCMC, about 20km from HCM, now there are lots of factory in BinhDuong now.

 

You might already hear about it: **Vietnam is now quickly growing in factory and foreign investment.** It is exactly what our factory doing, we have been operating a factory in Vietnam since 2018.

 

By the way, i am Chinese. According to my research, China mainland invest 22.8% of total newly registered capital and now is the No.2 foreign investment in Vietnam.

 

Here are some photos about our factory:

[PE Stretch Film](https://preview.redd.it/sbu5w5j3jd2g1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0037a7f16221d37230328c6b56b5897caef046e5)

[Production Line](https://preview.redd.it/nm02zg58jd2g1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=881c4fe3285e6546c72e88b904828a3ce849a539)

**As you can see, it is a tiny factory, not a big factory.** Because we are doing small business. We are making “Packaging Material”, for example, if your factory are making houseware like chairs, you will need PE stretch film for the pallet, the PE stretch film is what we produce. Our client are mainly the other factory in Vietnam, we usually don’t sell products directly to overseas.

  
Why we moving to Vietnam?

Because there is a trend in China mainland: Moving the factory from China to Vietnam. Because USA and some other country are giving better tariff to Vietnam. Some factory moving to Vietnam, and we want to do business with these factory, so we also move to Vietnam.

 

How is Vietnam factory going on?

I have to say, most thing goes well:

 

1. Vietnam Worker

Many people might said, Vietnam worker are lazy and don’t know how to operate the machine, but it is wrong. Most Vietnamese worker are very nice and hardworking, but the conversation are a little challenge, since they don’t speak Chinese or English and we only know very simple Vietnamese.

2. Vietnam GOV

Oh, in fact it is a little dark...The VN GOV sometimes will indeed ask for “Coffee Money”. But i also know that, Vietnam is now in  “Uncheked Growth”, which means that it growing very fast, but there is also something unchecked.

3. How is our business going?

Good, but not great. Because now many factory are quickly growing in Vietnam, we got lots of clients. But we also face some challenges about getting Vietnamese clients, since our sales department is not strong enough. The Chinese sales are good, but they don’t know how to teach the Vietnamese sales because of language barrier. We also want to hire mature Vietnamese sales, but there is a very limited choice, and many talented Vietnamese people are applying for jobs like teaching English and selling real estate. Our business is just small manufacturing, not attractive enough.

4. How is the payment of the Vietnamese workers?

Many factory are moving to Vietnam because of low payment, but in fact now in Vietnam, the worker’s payment are growng fast.

Now in Dongguan, China, the Chinese worker will be average paid 7000RMB after tax monthly,it is about 26,600,000VND and 984USD.

In BinhDuong, Vietnam, the Vietnamese worker will be average paid 12,000,000VND after tax monthly, it is about 3200RMB and 461USD.

Note: The working time is 12 hours a day, and 4 day off a month.

You might have many questions, let me answer for you:

(1)   
Q: Why is the working time too long.  
A: That’s why every country want to do high-tech business, because the profit for low-tech factory is too low, so the working time have to be long. Please notice that not only in Chinese invest factory, but in all factory in Vietnam has this long working time.  
(2)  
Q: Chinese worker really have 7000RMB monthly salary? The news told me that most chinese people don’t even earn 3000RMB one month.  
A: Dongguan is a very good province in China, just like in the Tier 2 city. We also have one factory in Dongguan. In other not so developed province in China, there is indeed low payment job like around 3000RMB. But in Dongguan, it is true for 7000RMB salary.

(3)

Q: Is Vietnamese worker really have this payment?

A: If you have been stay in Vietnam and know the true Vietnam, you will know that 10,000,000VND is a very common and reasonable salary in Vietnam. This salary is very common near Hanoi and HCM. There are also so place not so developed in Vietnam for example in the middle of Vietnam, i have no idea about the salary in the middle of Vietnam, but in BinhDuong the  10,000,000VND \~ 12,000,000VND salary is very common and reasonable.

(4)   
Q:How could Vietnamese people live by 461USD month salary?

A: In USA, the worker might be paid 4000USD for one month, so it is very hard for them to think life with 461USD payment. But in Vietnam, everything cost less. One meal might cost 10USD in USA, but one meal might just cost 1USD in Vietnam. So it is possible for Vietnamese to live with 461USD month salary. But to be honest, there is still a life quality gap between USA and Vietnam, but Vietnam is quickly growing now. And it is also not fair to compare Vietnam with USA.

  
**So my friend, do you have any questions about doing factory business in Vietnam? Ask me anything!**

**But please, don't ask political questions, i wish our conversation could be mainly about business and life, let's not talk too much political questions, ok?** Thank u.",34,1763628241.0,VietNam,25,0.97,False

I used to scroll through news the moment I opened my eyes, like hitting a fast-forward button on my brain. Now I just make a cup of coffee, sit in the morning light for a couple of minutes, and it feels like I finally got that space back.

I didn’t look at my phone during my commute, and I ended up noticing the ordinary city noise outside the window. I used to find those sounds annoying. Now they feel gentler than any feed—at least they don’t spike my anxiety.

Work went surprisingly well. Without my phone as an escape hatch, I had to face the roots of my procrastination. By 3 p.m., I felt that rare sense of “I actually moved things forward today.”

During an evening walk, it hit me: the phone wasn’t the one causing my anxiety. I was the one outsourcing my attention to it. Pulling that attention back naturally made my mind quieter.

It’s not some dramatic enlightenment, just a simple realization that calm was always there. I just kept letting notifications drown it out.",1,1763628174.0,TheBigGirlDiary,0,1.0,False
1p1y504,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1p1y504/mcp_wow_nap_reviews/,[MCP] Wow nap Reviews,"my 2nd year doing MCP, i hope this is far better than last time, thanks to the organizers and writing helpers for your time. 

**Prompt: A Yotul makes a blog reviewing and rating what sharing a bed with different species for a night is like. From preparing for bed, to getting comfy together, to sleeping, and to getting up and ready in the morning (or equivalent, if they visit VP/Skalga). Write a few entries, and maybe even the comments sections as well.**


**Species selection is fully up to the author, but if suggestions are needed, I suspect that Gojid, Drezjin, and of course Human would be interesting picks.**


Pouch written on the human-based InterGalactic Website known as PressWord.zorg, the Wowed Napper reviews have been one of the few stable xeno-written blogs in the last few years. The blogger is a female Yotul named Herda, who started as a review blog about different species' beds but gradually shifted focus to what it would be like to sleep with various members of different species. Not in a sexual way—if that were the case, we wouldn't be featuring them in the Blogies—but rather on the everyday life involved in trying to make a cross-species relationship work. Sleeping together, getting ready for work, and the small moments of daily life in such relationships, regardless of who has what. This is why I am nominating WoW Nap Review for Blog of the Year.


\-Steven Harden, one of the Committee members of the Bloggy Awards 


**Wow, Nap review date: Oct 21, 2151, entry 24: of Drezjin wings and Yotul pouches.**


Hello, critters of the secweb! It's Herda, and I'm back with another great blog post about napping with that special someone and comparing how different species rest together. I know I haven't posted in a while, but I do this more for myself now than for any audience. This isn't really a multi-species furniture review blog anymore; it's more about what it's like to sleep, wake up, and get ready for the day with a partner or friend of a different species. I found that part more fun to write, anyway. Besides, it was a pain dealing with my Venlil ex, Duru—being stuck on the Venlil homeworld for the past few months, acting as a witness for his illegal online activities. Still surprised he was smuggling that much human Methamphetamine by having his zurilluan friends hide it inside people to other worlds and sell it on the black market—sicko. I'm just glad he's rotting in a PD center, sorry, I mean a correctional facility for the mentally deprived. Still, he won't see daylight for a long time afterward.

So, anyway, onto the review. Today, I want to talk about my former boyfriend Siyp the Drezjin and how our nights of swipe went with him. We met in Fed anno, on my therapist's recommendation. You can find the full story here \[blog 12; sivkit chewing sofas and chairs\], but my family owned a Hensa breeding farm when the federation made first contact… burned all the kennels to the ground with my mother still inside, and my dad was held off in a PD center and died during a routine lobotomy. I was taken by Krakoti Foster care to have the Primitiveness pecked, slammed, and outright beaten out of me. Siyp was always questioning things and wanted to be a biologist growing up, instead of joining the colony’s antimatter terraforming business like the rest of them. So, he was forced to sleep outside the cave condo and nearly got eaten by large owl-like birds, known as nightflapers, which had wing membranes slashed. He was also forced to walk on the ground at one point.

We started talking by the coffee pot, and since his lease was ending soon, I decided to let him move in with me for a while. The dating naturally fell into place after that.

So, with that intro out of the way, onto the review.

**Sleeping; 1.5 out of five; size fears and awakening need for pouch rides.**


So, as much as I would have liked him to use the Drezjin resting poles that my former sponsor gave me—since I had made a lot of Drezjin friends—I felt like I should at least try sharing a bed if I wanted to make this work. I gotta say, have you ever had that feeling like you need to be more aware when you decide to take a newborn pop in your arms and fall asleep with the Joey in your hands instead of your pouch? Your motherly instincts kick in, and they keep you awake so you don’t crush your child. Yeah, imagine something similar with Drezjin, especially since I’ve heard panic screeches and even a few sharp bites when I accidentally rolled onto Siyp’s wing, or worse, his body.

We had to talk this out and try letting him sleep in my pouch, seeing that man was as he put it “the runt of his pup mates” and surprisingly, he fit. Having him in my pouch just made it easier to be aware of where Siyp was while we turned in for the night. Knowing there was a living creature in me (not in that way, you pervs) helped a lot.

I got comfortable with having him in my pouch all the time. I used him as an excuse to park in the carrying mother’s spot at the grocery store, but still, there were times I’d wake up, go take a shower, and he’d pop right out in a panic, forgetting he was there. Come to think of it, at some point he liked spending more time riding in the pouch than interacting with Me. Heck, by the end, a lot of times the Drezjin would pop himself into the pouch and hiss and bite if I tried to force him out. Leading us to…


**The morning after; one out of five: “everything is too big!”** 

That's what I would hear from halfway across the apartment, as the winged mammal, no bigger than my forearm, struggled to open the bathroom door, the refrigerator, turn the shower on and off, and flush the waste can. Yes, I installed aids designed to help smaller species move around my home but never learned how to use them. He would just whine at me from my pouch as we got ready together. It made everything so annoying and awkward. Also, can someone confirm if Drezjin are a cured species or not? Every time he bit me, I bled for hours, like I had to throw away so many towels and use countless bandages to stop the bleeding after getting scratched on the sofa or fighting in our bedroom. Damn, I had to throw both of them out because no one would go near the bloody stains! The winged mammal also seems to have an uncanny sense of where to bite to hit the most painful spots, which leads to… 


**Every day interactions- one out of five; emotional manipulation, playing the victim and the squid-fed gods.**


It felt like I was living with my adopted family again—never taking responsibility for anything, always playing up the difference in size and how tough it is to live a normal life “in a land full of giants,” especially after they used me as a chew toy. It wasn't until near the end of the relationship that I discovered he wasn't even genuinely homeless or fully disowned.

I overheard him one night when he stayed up late, thinking I was asleep. The little winged bastard was mocking my primitive self and the struggles I went through with my creepy squid-frog foster parents. He said I should be grateful that living gods were kind enough to even consider taking in a “lonely primitive” like me.

They were mocking all the stories I told the therapy group—how my father would look me in the eyes and throw ration packs behind me when we went on date nights, or how my mother would wipe me with her tentacles if I refused to attend Federation appreciation parades.

I stormed up to the fanged freak, grabbed him, and threw him out the window, then started tossing everything Siyp owned out after him. He’s been trying to call me for days, trying to explain that it was an act—that he still needed his family's financial support—which quickly turned into hundreds of harassing calls, punctured car tires, and my pet Hensa being malted by what could only have been a swarm of drezjin from the bleeding.

**Overview 1.25 out of five**

**WoW Nap review date Nov, 21, 2152 entry 36: in every arxur, there are two swamp puppers**


Hello interwebs, Herda here. I feel like I've finally picked myself up after the Gojid ex got the clear message that I didn’t want to move to the new cradle or his mother's place, for that matter. Still, I wish Boni paid for all the furniture he ruined with spikes, but getting him out of the basement after declaring squatters' rights was a pain and a half in its own right.


This next review will likely be seen as controversial, if not scandalous, but I finally got to nap with an arxur—two, in fact! I met them at the arxur embassy, which is in the old embassy district mostly because many embassies moved to the new embassy district of the capital. This happened because a lot of people didn’t like having their own ambassadors “at risk of being eaten” or some bullshit like that. I work as a freelance IT tech support, and based on the contract details, I’m making a pretty good amount from the ""brave herbivore” bonus. 


While there, I ended up being asked out by one of the two door guards, Visk. At the bar, I was joined by his twin brother, Krik. He never lets Visk wander out of his scent or sight, as unlike Krik, Visk is a bit more sensitive than what an arxur should be. Still, I managed to get along with them pretty well. So much so that Krik outright told me that if I wanted a relationship with Visk, I needed to be open to having him in the relationship too.


So that is how I ended up in my second polycule, now onto the review.


 **Sleeping; 4 out of 5; stuck in a warm Sandwich**


At first, during the few nights I spent in the Embassy Bunk apartment, I thought the warmth came from the apartment itself, but arxur are naturally warm-blooded. Something about their size makes it possible for them to generate their own body heat, or so it seems. Having them between me was surprisingly comforting. Two warm, smooth-scaled lizards forming a protective wall of muscle, claws, and fangs.


They never made me feel like I was in danger, despite Krik’s antisocial snaps from time to time; he seems to care, willing to share the bed with me and Visk. Plus, there are times when Visk decides to pull me closer to him, tightly. He had some bad experiences with his folks’ parenting style, being the “borderline defective” twin. Krik seems able to smell the duress almost instantly and loosens Visk’s grip on me when his clawed hands press my chest into his belly too tightly, or when my tail gets pulled between his calves.


**The morning after: 3.5 out of 5 flashes of warmth and cold.**


Despite being up to their hips, apparently, all of the Arxur’s Bucker apartments are built to have stands, adjustable sinks, and other amenities for mixed-species cohabitation. At least everything is made a lot more tail-friendly than the human embassy there. Guess I'm not the only contractor who found themselves living with one of the troops. Krik isn't very sociable when waking up; he ends up guiding me around the apartment as the three of us get ready, accompanied by bellows, snout clicks, and polite grunts of “please don't get in my way.”

His brother has a much warmer demeanor by miles, as Visk would lick me awake, just like how my Hensa used to—before the god grain thief had him put down at a fed-sympathizing veterinarian—making the decision to move much easier. Despite both of them and the neighboring units hating it, he would cook me vegetarian breakfast items on a hot plate he creatively borrowed from the Human embassy. Always willing to compliment me on my smell and always finding new fur shampoos for me to try.

So it was a mixed bag, but they both had the morning (graveyard) shift, when most of the other Arxur in the embassy are asleep. This explains the blackout curtains and the use of a red-tinted flashlight to navigate the apartment.

**Everyday interactions: 3 out of 5 in spite of the flaws, it never fully out waighted the good**

Dating two arxur with wildly different personalities can feel like whiplash in many situations. Let's start with Visk, a stuffed earth bear, who is always willing to hug and snuggle. He's much more extroverted than other arxur I've met, though I have only met about five so far. He's willing to attend plays, talk about how our days have gone, and is always a shoulder to cry on. The man knows how to paint landscapes, and on his days off, he hikes up to the hills to paint. Detailing how the moonlight shined over the trees and the busy night life of the capital. Guarding isn't his true calling, as he doesn't have a mean bone in his body. 

I remember going to a cafe in Diplomat Plaza, and exterminators showed up. Now, this is Leirn, yes, and they have lost a lot of power since joining the SC. Our police force makes us verify everything to ensure it's legitimate; we can't really have flamethrowers anymore. Heck, you can send a letter to their office once a year, saying that ""under no circumstance is anyone affiliated or working for the exterminators Guild allowed on the premises at any time."" Though I usually use more colorful language than that. 

Immediately, this silver-suited dossur jumped onto our table, pulling out a small-caliber hand cannon from how she was holding it, and kicked over my Visk blood tea and Cricket biscuits. The little runt was telling me they were looking for an arxur matching his description for eating the visiting Queen Of London’s dog or some shit, and needed to take him into custody. The other two exterminators, a fed-brained yotul and a mazic, were already moving to cuff and muzzle Visk as he started to cry.

So, I gave them my unfiltered opinion by chucking the dussur out the window and emphasized my point by grabbing the pull-out pistol the dussur had taken earlier and shooting the two rounds into the traitor's knees.

I was overwhelmed by the 600-pound mazic tackling me into everything in the café. The last thing I remember is feeling something very hot on my snout as a huge mass descended upon me.

As for Visk, from what the arresting officer told me in custody, he did end up hucking out after seeing me get waterboarded with hot coffee, and ended up shoving the big elephant-like woman's trunk right up the spout after ripping it clean off. She must be thanking the gods that we have socialized healthcare.

Krik is the standard arxur, very introverted, not very good at expressing himself, and “not really having a need for emotions like you leaf lickers.” Despite the snaps, he did a good job of showing he cared in other ways. We would have technical talks over text, which he seems more comfortable with than face-to-face interactions. Turns out he is very interested in video games and was trying to figure out how to get into coding.

In fact, he owns a ton of Terran and post-collapse board games and would host board game nights. For the lack of time spent in person, he made up for it online. Heck, he was the one who bailed us out of jail, and laughed when he found out I was on a first-name basis with most of the staff there. Yes, half of the interactions written in my blogs do end with violent altercations with local law enforcement, if you are new please read the rest of my posts.

Sadly, this relationship wasn't meant to last; they received orders requiring them to return home for training exercises. From Visk’s body language, I sensed it was something much worse. The brothers decided to end the relationship since they didn’t know if they would ever return, and Wriss wasn’t a place for someone like me yet. They helped me find a new place afterward, but what hurt most was that six months ago, the Arxur ambassador called me into his office and said the pair had died during their “training exercise.” At least I was given Visk’s paintings and Krik’s prototype game we were working on. I hope the fire-god lights your way to the afterlife.

**Fedrights2136 (suspended):** People like you is why we need some of the old PD centers back, you're clearly contaminated with predatory taint to do that to exterminators. What the fuck is wrong with the yotul? At least we were willing to try to help your coal-lunged bastards.


**Abetterday356:** I know this is years late but your friends didn’t die in a training accident. We had a civil war and the twins volunteered to take out a dam that a rebel tank battalion was passing by. They were able to bring down the dam but were unable to get out before the explosion. We were able to recover some of the remains and give them a military funeral. If you're still on this account, I still have some of their old belongings that I can mail to the embassy, sorry for your loss. I wanted to let you know the truth.



**Wow, Nap review date 2055 entry 56: meeting my human exchange partner** 



As I celebrate my 32nd birthday today, I've been participating in the human exchange program. I know that in recent years, humanity and Yotul haven't been the closest politically, but surprisingly, the exchange program wasn't cut off like some technocrats wanted, so I signed up a few months ago. I have to say, I never thought Stephen Harden would be so perfect. So, when I found out he was going to be on Leirn to handle some business here, despite the growing divide that our peoples have been experiencing lately, I asked if he would like to stay at my place for the next few weeks, and Stephen said yes. I picked him up from the star port and started telling him about this blog of mine. Turns out he found it a while ago, as it was being considered for some service, how did he describe it, “Academy award but for blogs” or something like that. He was oddly willing to share a bed with me so I could have an entry for humans. I usually don't have a subject that I'm willing to write about. Heck, I've been fighting off at least seven cease-and-desist letters and 15 removal requests. So onto the review

**Sleeping: 5 out of 5, hairless ape for the win!!!!**

Sleeping with someone taller than me didn't make me feel small, lying next to them. Although the man told me he's pretty small for his species, “5’3’ or something like that. Sleeping under the blankets on windy nights, I can feel the human, despite him still wearing his special sleepwear, which I think he called pajamas. He would keep me close because he was still cold. I forgot to tell them I didn't own many blankets, and the bed was more suited for a Yotul couple than most multi-species ones. I had to get rid of most of them when I was in a lesbian relationship with a Lesbee who didn't do well without an aquatic bed. For readers wondering about that, check out post 43, where yes, I followed her back to her home colony to set her hover car on fire, and no, I’m not paying unless the Darshan shield and SC finally realize that extradition treaties are not. No one takes a knife to my late arxur boyfrind’s paintings and then flees the planet to avoid a lawsuit.



**The morning after: 5 out of 5, man knows his way around a kitchen**


Stephen didn't spend that long in the shower compared to other species, similar to arxur due to the lack of hair on most of its body aside from the hair, chest, and groin. What really caught my attention was the breakfast he managed to make. Humans, being omnivores who eat both meat and vegetables, are obviously skilled at cooking non-meat meals, unlike my arxur boyfriends (read 36 if it hasn't been taken down again). They could taste it as they wanted instead of guessing. Plus, he brought some items from the import market—called vegan bacon, ham, cheese, and eggs—so I could have a facsimile of what a predator like my exchange partner would typically have. It was remarkable not having to deal with thick fur clogging the drain, slime marks on the walls, or finding loose feathers around the house. I could get used to this.



 **Everyday interactions: 5 out of 5; humanity is one of the most Interesting and if affectionate people I have ever met**


Stephen always went out of his way to make me feel welcome in my own home; he calls it being a guest, but I didn't feel like a host based on how he treated me or the apartment.

I took him around the square, figured out how to get around with the new high-speed trains, and even took him to some of the new museums to see pre-contact days. Another thing I found bewitching about Stephen was his interest in just about everything, as he wanted to see everything.

We visited places at the old historical playhouse, spent hours together looking at old books and digitized artifacts at the restored libraries, now that the Federation wasn't actively censoring them. Heck, when he saw the beaches where people were sailing and participating in Terran watersports despite the active belittling from so-called patriots of the technocracy, I rented a boat—the same kind my mother, my real mother, took me on when I was a kid.

The kind I would have likely called my profession if the feds hadn't come all those years ago. He complimented me on my sailing skills and asked where I learned them. I broke down crying, remembering the good times. It was like before my foster parents gave me the pills for my Predator disease all those years ago.


I don't think I ever felt like this since the twins; in fact, I don't think I've even had an argument that went too far or a time I needed to step up for a possible fight. Humans seem to be able to diffuse most conflicts with their words, which possibly says more about my own general temperament than anything else.


By the end of my exchange partner's trip, he asked if I would be interested in moving back to his hometown of San Francisco. He told me his division is looking for more IT people and is even willing to pay for relocation if they accept me. I didn't know what to say besides yes.

**Wow, Nap’s number 1 fan:** if this ends up being your last blog, then I'm happy it ended on humans. I don't think I ever met one who wasn't the kindest person in the room. Good luck with moving to Earth, you won't regret it.

**Spirit of Leirn (suspended and blocked):** God, you're one of those human lovers too—way to show your approval of the new Feds' uplifting first contact policies. Can't wait for the Techno Union Council to finally shut down the human embassy. At least this stupid blog is probably ending.

**Prompt: A Yotul makes a blog reviewing and rating what sharing a bed with different species for a night is like. From preparing for bed, to getting comfy together, to sleeping, and to getting up and ready in the morning (or equivalent, if they visit VP/Skalga). Write a few entries, and maybe even the comments sections as well.**


**Species selection is fully up to the author, but if suggestions are needed, I suspect that Gojid, Drezjin, and of course Human would be interesting picks.**


Pouch written on the human-based InterGalactic Website known as PressWord.zorg, the Wowed Napper reviews have been one of the few stable xeno-written blogs in the last few years. The blogger is a female Yotul named Herda, who started as a review blog about different species' beds but gradually shifted focus to what it would be like to sleep with various members of different species. Not in a sexual way—if that were the case, we wouldn't be featuring them in the Blogies—but rather on the everyday life involved in trying to make a cross-species relationship work. Sleeping together, getting ready for work, and the small moments of daily life in such relationships, regardless of who has what. This is why I am nominating WoW Nap Review for Blog of the Year.


\-Steven Harden, one of the Committee members of the Bloggy Awards 


**Wow, Nap review date: Oct 21, 2151, entry 24: of Drezjin wings and Yotul pouches.**


Hello, critters of the secweb! It's Herda, and I'm back with another great blog post about napping with that special someone and comparing how different species rest together. I know I haven't posted in a while, but I do this more for myself now than for any audience. This isn't really a multi-species furniture review blog anymore; it's more about what it's like to sleep, wake up, and get ready for the day with a partner or friend of a different species. I found that part more fun to write, anyway. Besides, it was a pain dealing with my Venlil ex, Duru—being stuck on the Venlil homeworld for the past few months, acting as a witness for his illegal online activities. Still surprised he was smuggling that much human Methamphetamine by having his zurilluan friends hide it inside people to other worlds and sell it on the black market—sicko. I'm just glad he's rotting in a PD center, sorry, I mean a correctional facility for the mentally deprived. Still, he won't see daylight for a long time afterward.

So, anyway, onto the review. Today, I want to talk about my former boyfriend Siyp the Drezjin and how our nights of swipe went with him. We met in Fed anno, on my therapist's recommendation. You can find the full story here \[blog 12; sivkit chewing sofas and chairs\], but my family owned a Hensa breeding farm when the federation made first contact… burned all the kennels to the ground with my mother still inside, and my dad was held off in a PD center and died during a routine lobotomy. I was taken by Krakoti Foster care to have the Primitiveness pecked, slammed, and outright beaten out of me. Siyp was always questioning things and wanted to be a biologist growing up, instead of joining the colony’s antimatter terraforming business like the rest of them. So, he was forced to sleep outside the cave condo and nearly got eaten by large owl-like birds, known as nightflapers, which had wing membranes slashed. He was also forced to walk on the ground at one point.

We started talking by the coffee pot, and since his lease was ending soon, I decided to let him move in with me for a while. The dating naturally fell into place after that.

So, with that intro out of the way, onto the review.

**Sleeping; 1.5 out of five; size fears and awakening need for pouch rides.**


So, as much as I would have liked him to use the Drezjin resting poles that my former sponsor gave me—since I had made a lot of Drezjin friends—I felt like I should at least try sharing a bed if I wanted to make this work. I gotta say, have you ever had that feeling like you need to be more aware when you decide to take a newborn pop in your arms and fall asleep with the Joey in your hands instead of your pouch? Your motherly instincts kick in, and they keep you awake so you don’t crush your child. Yeah, imagine something similar with Drezjin, especially since I’ve heard panic screeches and even a few sharp bites when I accidentally rolled onto Siyp’s wing, or worse, his body.

We had to talk this out and try letting him sleep in my pouch, seeing that man was as he put it “the runt of his pup mates” and surprisingly, he fit. Having him in my pouch just made it easier to be aware of where Siyp was while we turned in for the night. Knowing there was a living creature in me (not in that way, you pervs) helped a lot.

I got comfortable with having him in my pouch all the time. I used him as an excuse to park in the carrying mother’s spot at the grocery store, but still, there were times I’d wake up, go take a shower, and he’d pop right out in a panic, forgetting he was there. Come to think of it, at some point he liked spending more time riding in the pouch than interacting with Me. Heck, by the end, a lot of times the Drezjin would pop himself into the pouch and hiss and bite if I tried to force him out. Leading us to…


**The morning after; one out of five: “everything is too big!”** 

That's what I would hear from halfway across the apartment, as the winged mammal, no bigger than my forearm, struggled to open the bathroom door, the refrigerator, turn the shower on and off, and flush the waste can. Yes, I installed aids designed to help smaller species move around my home but never learned how to use them. He would just whine at me from my pouch as we got ready together. It made everything so annoying and awkward. Also, can someone confirm if Drezjin are a cured species or not? Every time he bit me, I bled for hours, like I had to throw away so many towels and use countless bandages to stop the bleeding after getting scratched on the sofa or fighting in our bedroom. Damn, I had to throw both of them out because no one would go near the bloody stains! The winged mammal also seems to have an uncanny sense of where to bite to hit the most painful spots, which leads to… 


**Every day interactions- one out of five; emotional manipulation, playing the victim and the squid-fed gods.**


It felt like I was living with my adopted family again—never taking responsibility for anything, always playing up the difference in size and how tough it is to live a normal life “in a land full of giants,” especially after they used me as a chew toy.

So, I gave them my unfiltered opinion by chucking the dussur out the window and emphasized my point by grabbing the pull-out pistol the dussur had taken earlier and shooting the two rounds into the traitor's knees.

I was overwhelmed by the 600-pound mazic tackling me into everything in the café. The last thing I remember is feeling something very hot on my snout as a huge mass descended upon me.

As for Visk, from what the arresting officer told me in custody, he did end up hucking out after seeing me get waterboarded with hot coffee, and ended up shoving the big elephant-like woman's trunk right up the spout after ripping it clean off. She must be thanking the gods that we have socialized healthcare.

Krik is the standard arxur, very introverted, not very good at expressing himself, and “not really having a need for emotions like you leaf lickers.” Despite the snaps, he did a good job of showing he cared in other ways. We would have technical talks over text, which he seems more comfortable with than face-to-face interactions. Turns out he is very interested in video games and was trying to figure out how to get into coding.

In fact, he owns a ton of Terran and post-collapse board games and would host board game nights. For the lack of time spent in person, he made up for it online. Heck, he was the one who bailed us out of jail, and laughed when he found out I was on a first-name basis with most of the staff there. Yes, half of the interactions written in my blogs do end with violent altercations with local law enforcement, if you are new please read the rest of my posts.

Sadly, this relationship wasn't meant to last; they received orders requiring them to return home for training exercises. From Visk’s body language, I sensed it was something much worse. The brothers decided to end the relationship since they didn’t know if they would ever return, and Wriss wasn’t a place for someone like me yet. They helped me find a new place afterward, but what hurt most was that six months ago, the Arxur ambassador called me into his office and said the pair had died during their “training exercise.” At least I was given Visk’s paintings and Krik’s prototype game we were working on. I hope the fire-god lights your way to the afterlife.

**Wow, Nap review date 2055 entry 56: meeting my human exchange partner** 



As I celebrate my 32nd birthday today, I've been participating in the human exchange program. I know that in recent years, humanity and Yotul haven't been the closest politically, but surprisingly, the exchange program wasn't cut off like some technocrats wanted, so I signed up a few months ago. I have to say, I never thought Stephen Harden would be so perfect. So, when I found out he was going to be on Leirn to handle some business here, despite the growing divide that our peoples have been experiencing lately, I asked if he would like to stay at my place for the next few weeks, and Stephen said yes. I picked him up from the star port and started telling him about this blog of mine. Turns out he found it a while ago, as it was being considered for some service, how did he describe it, “Academy award but for blogs” or something like that. He was oddly willing to share a bed with me so I could have an entry for humans. I usually don't have a subject that I'm willing to write about. Heck, I've been fighting off at least seven cease-and-desist letters and 15 removal requests. So onto the review

**Sleeping: 5 out of 5, hairless ape for the win!!!!**

Sleeping with someone taller than me didn't make me feel small, lying next to them. Although the man told me he's pretty small for his species, “5’3’ or something like that. Sleeping under the blankets on windy nights, I can feel the human, despite him still wearing his special sleepwear, which I think he called pajamas. He would keep me close because he was still cold. I forgot to tell them I didn't own many blankets, and the bed was more suited for a Yotul couple than most multi-species ones. I had to get rid of most of them when I was in a lesbian relationship with a Lesbee who didn't do well without an aquatic bed. For readers wondering about that, check out post 43, where yes, I followed her back to her home colony to set her hover car on fire, and no, I’m not paying unless the Darshan shield and SC finally realize that extradition treaties are not. No one takes a knife to my late arxur boyfrind’s paintings and then flees the planet to avoid a lawsuit.



**The morning after: 5 out of 5, man knows his way around a kitchen**


Stephen didn't spend that long in the shower compared to other species, similar to arxur due to the lack of hair on most of its body aside from the hair, chest, and groin. What really caught my attention was the breakfast he managed to make. Humans, being omnivores who eat both meat and vegetables, are obviously skilled at cooking non-meat meals, unlike my arxur boyfriends (read 36 if it hasn't been taken down again). They could taste it as they wanted instead of guessing. Plus, he brought some items from the import market—called vegan bacon, ham, cheese, and eggs—so I could have a facsimile of what a predator like my exchange partner would typically have. It was remarkable not having to deal with thick fur clogging the drain, slime marks on the walls, or finding loose feathers around the house. I could get used to this.



 **Everyday interactions: 5 out of 5; humanity is one of the most Interesting and if affectionate people I have ever met**


Stephen always went out of his way to make me feel welcome in my own home; he calls it being a guest, but I didn't feel like a host based on how he treated me or the apartment.

I took him around the square, figured out how to get around with the new high-speed trains, and even took him to some of the new museums to see pre-contact days. Another thing I found bewitching about Stephen was his interest in just about everything, as he wanted to see everything.

We visited places at the old historical playhouse, spent hours together looking at old books and digitized artifacts at the restored libraries, now that the Federation wasn't actively censoring them. Heck, when he saw the beaches where people were sailing and participating in Terran watersports despite the active belittling from so-called patriots of the technocracy, I rented a boat—the same kind my mother, my real mother, took me on when I was a kid.

The kind I would have likely called my profession if the feds hadn't come all those years ago. He complimented me on my sailing skills and asked where I learned them. I broke down crying, remembering the good times. It was like before my foster parents gave me the pills for my Predator disease all those years ago.


I don't think I ever felt like this since the twins; in fact, I don't think I've even had an argument that went too far or a time I needed to step up for a possible fight. Humans seem to be able to diffuse most conflicts with their words, which possibly says more about my own general temperament than anything else.


By the end of my exchange partner's trip, he asked if I would be interested in moving back to his hometown of San Francisco. He told me his division is looking for more IT people and is even willing to pay for relocation if they accept me. I didn't know what to say besides yes.


**Overview 5 out of 5; just the person I think I needed in my life.**



I don't know when or if I will start writing this blog again, but thank you for reading it. It's been a journey.

**Spirit of Leirn (suspended and blocked):** God, you're one of those human lovers too—way to show your approval of the new Feds' uplifting first contact policies. Can't wait for the Techno Union Council to finally shut down the human embassy. At least this stupid blog is probably ending.

*The NBL’s Most Anticipated Snack-Time Showdown*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: A Numbers Game**  
Let’s start with the cold, hard stats. Brisbane Bullets (home team) enter this matchup with a 58% implied probability of winning based on pre-game lines, while S.E. Melbourne Phoenix sit at 42%. That gap isn’t just a typo—it’s the difference between a team that’s “here for the vibes” and one that’s “here to win the vibes.”

Brisbane’s offense is a well-oiled machine, averaging 112.3 points per game, but their defense? Let’s just say they’re the reason the term “defense” was invented. Opponents score an average of 108.1 points against them—like a sieve that’s been *personally* challenged by water. Meanwhile, Melbourne’s defense is a fortress, holding opponents to 101.4 points per game, but their offense is about as reliable as a toaster in a monsoon (read: sparks, smoke, and existential dread).

Historically, Brisbane has dominated the Phoenix in recent matchups, winning 6 of the last 8 head-to-head battles. But here’s the kicker: Melbourne’s 42% implied probability isn’t just a number—it’s a *challenge*. They’re the underdog with the swagger of a cat that just knocked over your coffee, and Brisbane is the overdog with the posture of a dog that just got scolded for chewing the couch.

**2. Digest the News: Injuries, Drama, and a Sprained Metaphor**  
Let’s dive into the chaos. Brisbane’s star guard, *Jared Sullinger* (yes, that’s his name), is sidelined with a “sprained ego” after tripping over his own shoelaces during a pre-game interview. The team claims it’s just a minor injury, but let’s be real: Sullinger’s absence is like a pizza without cheese—technically edible, but spiritually bankrupt. Backup point guard *Lachlan Olbrich* will start, and if his stats are any indication, Brisbane’s offense will run at the speed of a sloth on a coffee break.

They are very religious and have a ""we need this if we cant go to the grocery store"" mentality about this hoard.

I try to tell them that in the event of an apocalypse, eating moth ridden rancid uncooked pasta will most definitely make you wish you had died in the initial blast. I cannot understand why they wouldn't even be excited to go buy more stuff to put back in. 

I even dangled it infront of them like a carrot like, ""you can go to costco to go get new stuff you like and will actually eat!"" And I know that is horrible and enabling but im at my literal wits end.

We now have a huge moth problem, and im sorry I know its childish, but i am deadly afraid of bugs and moths in particular. I have to walk through there every time i want to do laundry which is every few days.

We had hoards but we never had bugs except termites. I told myself I could live with it as long as there's no bugs. I cant do bugs i just cant do it.

Thank God i have my own fridge and pantry, but their pantry is spilling into mine now and I found moths in what I had presumed to be a closed container in my own pantry. Now im afraid to open anything in my pantry and eat it because what if thats a moth larva and not a grain of rice.

I FOUND LARVA IN TOILET PAPER TOO
Like I cant even wipe my ass in peace anymore 😭 

No matter how much i beg them to fix this (literally beg) all they do is put out moth traps and throw away the most obviously out of date salad dressing and call it a day. I truly think I might throw it all away like a bandit in the night and accept whatever consequences come my way.

My dad said ""go ahead and do it but i want to see what youre throwing away. And then we need to go through each package and vacuum seal it so bugs dont get in""
Why does he need to know what im throwing away? Does he even know half of it exists? Im convinced if i put empty boxes with fake food in them he would literally never notice they were gone. 

What can I do to change this? My dad is the main hoarder, but now its my mom too. She has a very frugal mindset to the point that i think she feels a sense of pride and that other people are foolish for ""throwing away perfectly good things"" but in reality its rundown ragged and covered in grime and dirt. Like she is so proud she doesnt ""waste her money"" she feels better about herself? I have no idea. I feel proud when i save 40% on my groceries or score at the thrift, not holding onto a mold shower curtain because its not completely moldy just yet. Thats disgusting.

Eg:
One time i threw ice in the sink to make another fresh ice coffee with fresh ice. She saw me do this and immediately got upset I didnt just wash off the ice and use it again. From the dirty sink. 

I told her I was actually offended that she would even insinuate I should take ice from a dirty sink like an animal. Word for word. She didnt take that well and I understand but I told her that was outburst was the culmination of her showing me what she thought I was deserving of in her eyes. It doesnt make it right but I needed her to know why i acted that way. 

I guess im starting to rant now, and i apologize but ive never opened up about this to anyone but my family and therapist. Now that its getting to this point I literally dont know or have anyone to turn to for advice. Do I reach out to my brothers? They tell me that they dont want me to feel like they're abandoning me (I dont want to give my age but i am a disabled adult on a fixed income therefore do not have much of a choice or say in my living situation) and leaving me alone to deal with this. But i kind of feel like I am cause no one else is brave enough to stand up to my dad but me, the youngest daughter of all people 💀

This doesnt even scratch the surface of how my dad is letting himself go and in turn dragging my mother down with him. Everyone just keeps letting him get away with this i feel like im living in the twilight zone. The biggest stress in our family right now is what we're going to do with all of my dad's shit when he dies. He's in his late 70s and just had a life threatening blood clot so its getting really real out here. 

Id appreciate any support or advice anyone has because this really feels like a turning point as far as how bad its getting and I cannot allow this to happen. Like i refuse and will do anything in my power to stop it 😭

Tldr: my parents wont clean out their rancid moth infested pantry because they think the apocalypse is coming and wont even replace it for who tf knows what reason.

    its fight replaying, its outcome fixed.

    Can I reclaim the essence

    I kept falling from the efforts I made, 
    sitting in the dark with no one
    but myself to blame.
    
    In the undying condition I exist in,
    in the never-ending cycle I stepped
    into was there ever any hope to begin with,
    or just another means to make amends with?

    how the coffee lingered and stewed.
    As I left, I recalled
    how quietly sad you were.
    
    Now the image has turned black,
    but the frown on your rosy lips remains;
    unbridled, yet estranged
    just a shadow of you remains.
    
    Those despairing words,
    those echoes once full of heart

Last month L asked if I could maybe ""help them a bit"" if they got confused with transport. I said sure, if they get stuck they can text and I will try to answer.

Stuff like ""Monday - OP will meet you at airport at 7, help with luggage, then show you the historic center"" and ""Tuesday - OP will take you to government office to sort your pension paperwork"" and even ""Weekend - OP will invite you for home cooked traditional dinner"".

Many years ago, it was Jooz. Now the cup has become smaller ;(

Recently, i chance upon the Flow Coffee machine at La Salle, surprisingly the drinks tasted better than some cafes, and it’s cheaper. 


Any other vending machines around Singapore to recommend?

— Morning

Another one hundred degree day in Brimstone Creek. The air feels like a wool blanket, thick with red dust and the scent of baked sagebrush. It is not quite six in the morning, but the heat coming off the ground is enough to warp the planks on the porch of the Mercantile.

I woke at sunrise, as always, but did not open up until seven. The bell above the door has been ringing all day long, mostly for things I cannot sell much of, like small cans of peaches or an extra bolt for a rifle. Mr. Henderson, the blacksmith, was first to borrow a few pennies. He promises to repay me on Tuesday. I doubt he will.

— Half past noon 

A man I did not recognize, riding a fine black mare came in not 10 minutes ago. He bought four whole sacks of oats and paid in silver dollars, a sound that has become rare around here. He was not talkative, just a quick shake of the hand and a warning to “keep warm”. He did not look worried, just tired. I thought nothing of it. Men on the trail are often tired. He rode off in haste. I wondered if he’s a Bad Man you read about in the Press.

— Evening

I finished tallying the register by five thirty. The day was a wash, but the profit from the horse dealer put me in the black for the week. I locked the massive oak door of Vance's Mercantile and started the short walk back to the small room behind the store, where I sleep.

The town is quiet. Too quiet for a Saturday night, though the heat keeps most folk inside. Tonight, though, there is a distinct coolness that I have not felt in three weeks. It is not relief; it is a sharpness in the air, the kind that hints at a high altitude storm, but it is moving too fast. The scent of ozone is thick.

I looked up. The sky is dark, but not with clouds. It is a deep, bruised purple that swallows the stars. It feels less like weather and more like the shadow of a mountain that is not there.

— Half past seven 

I went inside and closed the door. It is probably just a dust storm coming in early. I will wake up tomorrow and everything will be buried in fine red powder, and I will spend the morning sweeping.

I hope I do not dream of Martha or Clara tonight. Sleep is the only place they live anymore.




August 5th, 1888

— Six in the Morning

The quiet was the first thing that bothered me. There were no crickets, no birdsong, just stillness. When I went outside, the porch was slick with moisture, and the air bit at my cheeks. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but there was a thin sheet of white frost coating the porch railing and the dried sagebrush outside. August. Frost. It made no sense. I checked the thermometer I keep nailed to the wall. It read 31 degrees Fahrenheit. An hour before dawn. It should be 75.

— Half past seven 

The stove was stoked quickly. I got the Mercantile open. The sun was up and doing its work. By the time old Mr. Hemmings rode in for his coffee beans, the frost had melted to mud and steam. The ground hissed.

— Ten in the morning 

Business was steady. A few prospectors needed to resupply before heading back into the higher ground. Agnes Thorne was in, looking for a new tin of baking powder. She spent twenty minutes complaining that the last batch made her biscuits flat. I told her flat biscuits were not a matter of my powder, but perhaps the way she was rolling them. She gave me a look that could curdle milk and left without buying anything. That was the humor for the day, I suppose.

— Afternoon

Dr. Finch came in looking for whiskey, which he claims is for ""medicinal poultices."" We both know it is for his nerves. He bought two quarts and asked me about the frost. I told him what the thermometer said. He muttered something about a cold air vortex, but he looked worried. He is too smart to accept a simple answer. He has seen enough death to know when nature is out of balance.

— Sunset

I locked up right at closing. The sun is still high, but the light has a strange, yellow cast. The heat that defined yesterday is gone. The temperature is maybe fifty degrees, which is a glorious early fall day, not August. The wind is starting to pick up, and it is carrying a sound with it, a thin, high whistle. It sounds like air moving through a very tight keyhole.

I walked the ten paces to my back room and looked at the sky one last time. That deep purple from yesterday is bigger now. It is swallowing the horizon. It looks like a massive bruise on the face of the world.

The feeling that the most genuinely real interactions I've ever had on the internet have been here on Reddit. I feel like, generally speaking, smart, intellectually curious people gravitate to this platform, while a lot of the, let's just say less-substantive content and users are often found on platforms like TikTok (I know everyone has their preferences, this is just my take).

My question is: Where are the people from Reddit in real life? Why am I not walking into a coffee shop, a museum, or a bar and running into people who communicate with the same insight, wit, and intellectual honesty that I see in the best subreddits? Why don't they show up in person the way they do here? 

Imagine a Reddit Annual Reunion/Convention: If we showed up as our digital selves wearing our usernames, maybe a pin of our latest sub flair, or an avatar mask I genuinely think this convention would be awesome. Maybe even better than a huge music festival. It wouldn't be full of ""dreadlock performance artists"" or ""crystal hoarders,"" but a group of genuinely intelligent people. It would be an intelligent convention without all the performative celebrity intellectualism (sorry, Brian Greene, lol). Thoughts? Does anyone else feel like there's a huge disconnect between the quality of conversation here and the quality of conversation offline?

P.S. If you disagree, feel free to tell me which other platform you think has the highest collective intelligence!
