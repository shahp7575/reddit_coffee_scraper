1hvmocb,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1hvmocb/trip_report_rio_what_a_city/,Trip Report: Rio - WHAT a city.,"**Context:**¬†I've just finished up 3 months working across South America and crammed Rio and S√£o Paulo into the last two weeks before Christmas. I'm a 34-year-old male, Product Designer from the UK and have been working remotely and on the move for the last 4 years.

**Verdict:**¬†A simply¬†*incredible*¬†city with something for everyone. I'd love to return, but in full holiday mode - swapping the WeWork for more time on the beach or going all out for a week at Carnival. I'd suggest this might suit most people better, as unless you really, really love the beach, other cities may still offer a better overall package for a longer remote work trip. If you're planning a trip to South America, I'd carve out a week and have a holiday there.

After an incident-free trip prior across Bogot√°, Medell√≠n, Lima, Santiago and Buenos Aires, where there seemed to be an ascending scale of security in each city, in all honesty, I was somewhat apprehensive before arriving in Brazil. I had heard¬†*so*¬†many concerning stories from people who had experienced issues there firsthand, I didn't quite know what to expect.

**The reality was much different and Rio felt much, much safer on the ground than I imagined.**  
I spent the entire first day covering as much ground as possible on foot and was surprised by how walkable practically the entire South Zone (Zona Sul) was. The only area which felt it required specific caution was around Pra√ßa Cardeal C√¢mara (marked in orange below) in Lapa, which early in the morning didn't feel like somewhere you'd want to linger unaccompanied.

I don't want to overstate its safety - it's certainly a city that has its problems. But even for the most risk-averse traveller, I didn't see anything that would mean you shouldn't consider making a trip there.

For added context, compared to Colombia, which in retrospect felt like the least secure of the countries I visited, I wouldn't have attempted a 6-hour walk traversing either Bogot√° or Medell√≠n.

# üõå Where to stay

If you're working from Rio rather than on holiday, you're likely to have a different set of priorities than a traditional holidaymaker. Most conventional advice would heavily suggest Ipanema or Leblon - but if you're spending 40 hours a week in a coworking space rather than on the beach, paying a beachside premium may not make as much sense, and you may want to look a little further afield.

Modern and affordable accommodation isn't one of Rio's strong points. A combination of high seasonal tourist demand and a relative shortage of modern building stock means that, more than in other cities, you really need to book as far in advance as possible when planning a month-long stay.

For the equivalent price of a quality one-bed apartment in Buenos Aires, in the streets behind Ipanema and Copacabana, you're likely to find smaller, more dated studio units - representing a substantial drop in size, specification and amenities.

If I were to return on holiday, I would spend $$$ on a beach front looking apartment in Ipanema for a few nights, well outside my normal budgeting restraints.

**‚úÖ Ipanema**

It's easy to see why Ipanema is often cited as the best location for visitors to Rio de Janeiro. It feels calmer than Copacabana, with quieter side streets off the busy front . You have immediate access to the beach and Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon right behind, with a 7.5km circuit perfect for walking or jogging. Would be the safest bet for most visitors, especially if it's your first time in Brazil or South America.

**‚úÖ Leblon**

If you're walking west from Ipanema, these two areas blur somewhat into one another, separated by a canal. Considered more upmarket and sedate than Ipanema, with progressively more refined and sophisticated dining and shopping options. An ideal option if you're a bit anxious about visiting Rio / South America for the first time. It still has a very relaxed feel with inexpensive places to pick up meals.

**‚úÖ Botafogo**¬†\+¬†**Flamengo**

These two neighbourhoods are both well worth considering and are less touristy than those mentioned above. Flamengo is the farthest north I would consider staying, and it gradually blends into Botafogo, which feels like the most hipster-ish area of the city. If you're planning a longer, month-long stay, you're likely to find better value here. Both areas also have beaches with a more relaxed feel than Ipanema or Copacabana. Walking around during the daytime felt safe in both with tonnes of inexpensive places for food, coffee and drinks.

**Copacabana**

Home to the famous beach, this area has a bit more of a dated feel than it's more upmarket neighbours to the West. If you're not planning to make the most of the sand, your money is probably better spent elsewhere. You can technically reach Botafogo on foot by walking on the road over the hill, but this is likely to be unappealing to most people as is a steep gradient and you are somewhat isolated. I‚Äôd aim for the eastern side of the area, closer to Ipanema if considering basing yourself there.

**‚ùå Lapa**

Popular area for nightlife, but it's not somewhere I would recommend staying, especially if your primary focus is work. There's a notable increase in homeless and destitute people around the immediate area compared to Flamengo, which lies directly south. Particularly if it's your first time in South America - give it a miss.

‚ùå¬†**Centro**

The commercial 'downtown' area of the city. I experimented with staying in Centro to be near the WeWork and minimise the amount of time carrying my laptop around, but it's not an experiment I'd recommend anyone else repeat. I would have no concerns about commuting on the metro with a laptop. While it's only a 20-minute metro ride from the more southerly neighbourhoods, it's an absolute ghost town over the weekends. A viable choice if you're visiting Monday-Friday and need immediate access to the area. 100% worth exploring during the work week.

[Looking across Ipanema beach over the weekend feels like every image you've seen of Rio in the past. An unbelievably high concentration of people lines the beach, with canopied bars \(barracas\) found every 15 metres. A loud, hot and intoxicating atmosphere.](https://preview.redd.it/4kt76m513jbe1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d72a117726c78a4375672bac5f602f75589ccac0)



[Out of any of the central areas you may be considering staying in, Leblon has the best-maintained streets and most modern infrastructure, with accommodation prices on Airbnb to match.](https://preview.redd.it/x40kpj333jbe1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5510fa385917e183a1c85c8459fac3f06c66b8de)

# üí∞ Value

Having spent the last month in both¬†Buenos Aires¬†and¬†Santiago¬†which were two of the most expensive places on the continent - Rio felt like incredible value as of Dec 2024.

Filling, tasty local meals at lanchonetes (informal 'snack bars') can be found for around ¬£5, with more sophisticated international options coming under ¬£10. Speciality coffee and patisserie items are on par with the quality you would expect from somewhere twice the price, if not higher, in European cities.

I loved the simplicity and convenience of Brazilian food from these sorts of places. A piece of meat, rice, beans and either salad or chips, served fresh and usually within 5-10 minutes. You're unlikely to find any gastronomical delights in such places but they're reliable, tasty and the types of places which are distinctly missing in both Buenos Aires and Santiago.

Depending on where you head, drinks in bars can be particularly inexpensive, with large bottles of beer available for a couple of pounds, though expect those prices to rise naturally in more sophisticated venues.

Even in the countless beachside bars, which are typically tourist traps wherever you set foot globally, costs remain consistently reasonable, offering similar prices and quality for food and drink to what you'd expect elsewhere in the city.

Metro tickets cost under ¬£1, and getting around in the evenings via Uber is particularly inexpensive.

Expect the cost of accommodation to go through the roof in the month surrounding the carnival. Unless you are visiting explicitly for the purposes of attending, you would be best off avoiding that period entirely.

A loud, hot and intoxicating atmosphere.Out of any of the central areas you may be considering staying in, Leblon has the best-maintained streets and most modern infrastructure, with accommodation prices on Airbnb to match.

# üíª Where to work

There's a more than adequate selection of coworking spaces across each of the key neighbourhoods from Leblon to Centro, but notably fewer top-quality options than you'd expect from a more renowned remote work hub.

WeWork has two options remaining, both in the slightly inconvenient Centro district, which, unless you already have membership access, probably aren't worth considering.

If you do have WeWork Access - the one at at¬†**Av. Alm. Barroso, 81**¬†is a solid option and the area around it is great to explore during the week.

**Arca Hub**¬†in Ipanema looked like one of the best options in terms of location and quality, and somewhere I would aim to be within close proximity to on a return visit.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety

**Centro over the weekends is best avoided.**  
Unlike the rest of the city which is a consistently bustling hive of activity, over the weekend the streets of Centro had the eeriness of a film set imitating a post-nuclear holocaust. There are a number of police patrols stationed around, but this area should be avoided, as much for the sheer boredom of being there rather than it being outright dangerous. Monday to Friday, I loved it as a place to work from, with a distinct busy energy and abundance of lunch spots, where walking its streets felt entirely safe.

**Solo hiking felt safe.**  
Going on long independent walks away from police patrols and crowds was definitely something you shouldn't consider doing in Bogot√° or Medell√≠n, but it felt entirely safe to do so in Rio. All throughout the Tijuca National Park, you'll encounter people running or cycling through individually or in small groups, with occasional police checkpoints on roads. The roads along the top benefit from significant elevation, meaning that while you may be physically close to other neighbourhoods in raw distance, reaching these heights requires deliberate effort - a marked contrast to Colombian cities where informal housing would often be directly at the trailheads.

**Look after your belongings on the beach.**  
This goes without saying, but due to the sheer density of people on the beach, there's an enormous potential for opportunistic theft. Leave whatever you don't critically need at home.

**Phone theft is likely to be the biggest threat.**  
Given how much visual splendour is on display, you'll probably be trigger happy throughout your stay in the city. I heard stories of street bands working in tandem with local thieves to create easy targets, snatching devices from unsuspecting people's hands. It shouldn't deter you from using your phone in public, but don't invite trouble by being careless.

**The metro felt safe and secure at all times.**  
It can get packed during rush hours near key stations, but it was a highly efficient, safe and cheap way to get across the city.

[entro takes on a distinctly dystopian feel over the weekend once its office-working population has left. Whilst there's reassuring police presence around Cinel√¢ndia, most restaurants are closed and you'll struggle to find even a supermarket open. A terrible place to spend any portion of your weekend in such an energetic city.](https://preview.redd.it/2qaqhimu3jbe1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd2307a9827fa2e2c3f462c83107b887840bdd74)



# ‚òïÔ∏è Food & drink

**The Slow Bakery** \- An ideal spot for a weekend morning, offering a wide range of artisanal baked goods and brunch dishes in a stylish setting. Expect queues during busy periods. While the espresso was underwhelming, I‚Äôd return for one of their filter coffee options.

**Coffee Five** \- The best espresso I had in Rio, served on the ground floor lobby of an office building in Centro. Popular with local office workers, it also offers an excellent cheesecake. Just a 10-minute walk from the WeWork.

**Pav√£o Azul 2** \- A simple lanchonete a few streets back from Copacabana beach serving Brazilian staples, with ice-cold beers and live sports on the TVs. Would recommend the Carne de Sol with Mandioca Frita (sun-dried beef with cassava fries)



# ü•æ Hikes

Over the weekend I visited, the roads connecting the rolling hills were well populated with runners and cyclists, and it felt safe to be exploring such areas unaccompanied.

No matter the duration of your trip, it's well worth putting some time aside to explore the national park which, when looking at the map, appears as the large green expanse towering above the city's west, offering incredible views over Zona Sul.

Most visitors to the city will want to take in the iconic¬†Christ the Redeemer¬†statue which is at the far east of this area in a self-contained, ticketed site, accessible via the Cosme Velho train and is a convenient place to start. Arrive as early in the day as possible to avoid the inevitable rush of visitors later on.

I deliberated for a while on attempting the Pedra da G√°vea hike. After reading many reviews on¬†Google Maps,¬†I opted for the smaller and much easier nearby¬†Pedra Bonita, which offers similar views but was ultimately more suitable for my entirely gripless, aged New Balance trainers. It would be my first port of call on a return visit with some more suitable footwear.

# üëç Positives

**As vivid and distinctive as the photos make out.**  
When the sun is out, Rio is one of the most spectacular cities I can recall visiting. The dramatic hills, long beaches and deep blue waters create some of the most evocative scenery you can witness in an urban setting. No Photoshop or filters required. Aside from the natural scenery, the samba music, pastel-coloured colonial buildings and Christ the Redeemer standing over the city make it a destination that's unlike anywhere else in the world, immediately recognisable. An amazing introduction to Brazil.

**A high-quality and easily accessible metro system.**¬†You can simply tap your contactless debit or credit card to enter the subway, just as you would in London. A single ticket currently costs around 5.80 Reais.

**A big street-drinking atmosphere.**¬†Whether this is on tables outside a snack bar, on the beach, or perched on a wall overlooking the sunset, you're likely to find groups of friends sharing a 600ml 'cerveja garrafa' poured into small 'copo americano' tumblers. As someone who personally loves the unsophisticated, raw nature of drinking a beer outside, this is a welcome cultural practice.

**Consistently good value can be found across Rio's beachfront.**¬†Both formal and informal beach bars can be found next to any patch of sand across the city and felt remarkably well-priced. You can expect similar outlets in Europe to be pure price-gouging exercises, but perhaps due to their sheer abundance, it's not an issue in Rio. Expect to pay similar prices to what you would away from the beach, with card payments as ubiquitous as they are in the main centre.

**Finding a tasty and filling local meal requires next to no effort.**¬†True of both Rio and S√£o Paulo, this made Brazil arguably the easiest place on the continent to pick up an inexpensive meal after work with minimal fuss. Most menus at lanchonetes are likely to revolve around a protein item, rice, beans, chips or salad, and having dined at numerous establishments, the quality appears consistently good. Expect to pay around ¬£5 for a large, filling meal and ¬£2 for a large beer.



# üëé Negatives

**You're likely to get the most out of Rio as a holiday destination.**  
Most people's ideal itinerary for the city is more likely to include sipping caipirinhas on the beach and maximising your vitamin D intake than being closed away in a coworking space for 40 hours a week. Of course you can balance this out on weekends, but also taking into account the more expensive accommodation, Rio more than any other city I visited felt like somewhere to have an amazing time with friends over a condensed period, rather than trying to juggle work commitments.

**Frequently wet weather.**¬†Prior to visiting, I couldn't comprehend anything less than consistent blue skies and sun, having not seen a single photo that didn't reflect that. However, rainfall is common throughout summer, with December and January expecting 18+ days of rain each per month. The aesthetics of the city contrast massively depending on the cloud cover, and on a dark day it can be a rather depressing spectacle, especially if you are on a time-restricted itinerary and itching to make the most of the outdoors. I'd book for at least a week to allow yourself to not be too hampered with any wet days.

**An underwhelming coffee scene.**¬†For a country renowned for its coffee production, Rio wasn't a city that stood out for coffee. While you can find specialty grade coffees, there was a surprising lack of strong options in the tourist areas of Leblon and Ipanema.



# üìã Tips

**Try and pick up some Portuguese before arriving**. After spending 10 weeks speaking (limited) Spanish across the rest of the continent, I struggled arriving in Brazil. While I was far from conversational elsewhere, I quickly realised when I stepped out of the airport my vocabulary didn't extend a single word beyond 'Obrigado!'. In general, English is generally spoken incredibly sparsely. The most flowing interaction I had ended up being with an Uber driver where we periodically shouted out the names of Brazilian footballers playing in the English Premier League. You can scrape by for a couple of weeks, but if you're planning on staying longer, I'd 100% recommend learning some basics to get the most out of the experience.

**If travelling domestically, aim to depart from Santos Dumont**. You may encounter lengthy delays driving to¬†GIG¬†(Gale√£o International Airport), which is often susceptible to heavy traffic.¬†Santos Dumont¬†offers a super short commute if travelling from anywhere within the South Zone.

**Consider your wardrobe carefully for Rio.**¬†My usual travel uniform of black t-shirts, which would serve most urban environments without fail, felt particularly uninspired. Rio is an ideal place to pack your loudest, loosest-fitting shirts where it's highly unlikely they'd feel out of place. I'd opt for waterproof flip-flops over cork Birkenstocks if making heavy use of the beach and to protect against any downpours.

**A good city to arrive in pristine shape.**¬†There aren't many cities on the planet where you're likely to have your top off throughout the majority of the day. There's definitely an emphasis on health, fitness and appearance throughout the city. Does this mean you should arrive with a six pack? Not necessarily, but I'd suggest not following my health programme of consuming 40 empanadas in the preceding two weeks in Argentina.

**Try to visit somewhere else in Brazil in addition to Rio.**¬†Given it is so vivid, distinctive and unique, visiting Rio in isolation could give you a somewhat distorted view of what this enormously diverse country is like. I was really glad I carved out time to also see S√£o Paulo, as it reflected a very different culture and one to which I probably felt more personally connected.

**For most transactions in Brazil, you'll be asked whether your card is Debit or Credit.**¬†This can be quite confusing as while I always used a UK Monzo debit card, it would generally only work if I selected the Credit option. Try both options if your payment isn't going through.

**Tipping in Brazil is straightforward.**¬†Expect a 10% service charge added to your bill automatically when dining in. Not carrying physical cash for tipping purposes did not feel problematic.

**An eSIM from Saily offered reasonable value for money.**¬†15GB of data cost¬†around ¬£18¬†and was better value than the Airalo equivalent.I've just finished up 3 months working across South America and crammed Rio and S√£o Paulo into the last two weeks before Christmas.

One common question that frequently arises is whether it's safe to enjoy everyone's favorite comfort food: chicken nuggets. The hours and days following a teeth whitening treatment are crucial for maintaining your results and preventing potential staining or sensitivity.

Understanding Teeth Whitening and Food Restrictions

After a professional teeth whitening procedure, your teeth become temporarily more porous and sensitive. This means that the foods and drinks you consume can have a significant impact on your newly brightened smile. The **whitening process temporarily opens the pores of your tooth enamel**, making them more susceptible to staining and potential damage.

Why Food Choices Matter After Teeth Whitening

Immediately following teeth whitening, dentists recommend following a **white diet** to prevent staining. This means avoiding foods and drinks that could potentially discolor your teeth, including:

- Dark-colored sauces
- Red wine
- Coffee and tea
- Colored sodas
- Berries
- Tomato-based sauces

Chicken Nuggets and Teeth Whitening: The Detailed Analysis

Let's dive into the specific concerns about chicken nuggets after teeth whitening:

1. Potential Staining Concerns
Chicken nuggets themselves aren't typically a major staining risk. However, the breading and accompanying sauces can be problematic. **Breaded foods with darker coatings or sauces might cause temporary discoloration**.

2. Temperature Sensitivity
Teeth can be particularly sensitive after whitening. Hot chicken nuggets might cause discomfort or pain. It's recommended to:
- Let food cool down slightly
- Eat slowly
- Avoid extremely hot or cold foods

3. Nutritional Considerations
While chicken is a protein-rich food, the processed nature of nuggets might not be the best choice immediately after teeth whitening. **Opt for plain, grilled chicken instead** for a healthier alternative.

Safe Eating Guidelines After Teeth Whitening

To ensure the best results and minimize sensitivity, follow these guidelines:

- Wait at least 48 hours before consuming potentially staining foods
- Choose light-colored, mild-temperature foods
- Drink plenty of water
- Use a straw to minimize contact with teeth
- Avoid acidic or sugary foods

Risks of Eating Chicken Nuggets Too Soon

Consuming chicken nuggets immediately after teeth whitening might:
- Increase tooth sensitivity
- Potentially stain newly whitened teeth
- Cause temporary discomfort
- Compromise the whitening treatment's effectiveness

Expert Recommendations

Most dental professionals suggest waiting **24-48 hours** before introducing more complex foods into your diet. During this time, stick to:
- White rice
- Plain chicken
- Soft white fish
- Egg whites
- Tofu
- Cauliflower
- Bananas

When Can You Safely Enjoy Chicken Nuggets?

After the initial 48-hour period, you can gradually reintroduce chicken nuggets. **Choose lighter-colored nuggets and avoid dark sauces** for the first week after your teeth whitening procedure.

- Avoid staining foods and drinks
- Schedule regular dental check-ups

Conclusion

Navigating food choices after teeth whitening requires careful consideration. While chicken nuggets aren't strictly forbidden, it's crucial to be mindful of timing, temperature, and potential staining risks. By following professional guidelines and listening to your dentist's recommendations, you can enjoy your favorite foods while maintaining your bright,",1,1736235923.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False

I went to sleep, well lights out, *before 9pm last night*. And I still woke up and was exhausted today. I think I‚Äôd like to sleep early again today. I want to try be up at 8:15am tomorrow.

I‚Äôve been a bit selfishly nervous, I wonder if he‚Äôll offhandedly mention me and then they‚Äôll form some sort of intervention telling him to drop me and they‚Äôll set him up with a friend of theirs or something. It‚Äôs not that I think he would do as he was told because I know he isn‚Äôt like that, but to have your best friends doubt someone you‚Äôre choosing sows a seed, no? I hope I just don‚Äôt get mentioned full stop and he instead has the best couple of days with them ever. I hope their little boy remembers and adores him, I know he isn‚Äôt an uncle but he may as well be and he‚Äôd be so cute with kids.

A little bit of a background here. I'm (22F) currently a college student in my last semester, so lately I've been very busy doing my thesis and my other final assignments. I've been feeling overwhelmed and depressed from how much work I have to do. I have a niece (1) from my sister (26), last year around July-August on my semester break i offered to take care of my niece when her nanny had to come home so she could accompany her kid to go to kindergarten. 

My sister at that time goes to work from around 11 AM and would come home at around 9 or 10 PM that's why she asked me to take cares of my niece.  At first we agreed that I would only be taking care of my niece for 2 weeks, but 2 weeks turns into 1 and a half months instead (basically all my semester break) and it was the most stressful time that i've ever felt in a long time. 

Not only I have to take care of my niece like bathing her, changing her diapers, feed her, took her to the park, and put her to sleep, I also have to do house chores like cooking, sweeping and mopping the floor, hanging the laundry dry, and takes care of my sister's father in law, so I would have to make him toast in the morning, serves him his lunch and dinner, make coffee when he wanted it, and buy his cigarettes when he ran out.

Her husband got off work early but he is extremely unreliable and whenever I told him to watch over and play with his kid he would either scroll his phone or sleep instead. I cried so many times while I was at my sister's house taking care of my niece. They did pay me, but what they paid me is not enough for how much labor that I had to do.

  
Now its January 2025 and my sister just called me a few hours ago that she needs me there at her house to take care of my niece again. She now works from home but that doesn't mean that she can take care of her kid all the time and while my sister hired a nanny again, the nanny is tasked to take care of my sister's father in law now since he have a stroke and cannot do anything by himself again.

  
I told her I can't because I have a meeting with my profesor regarding my thesis and i cannot miss that meeting or reschedule it because I have so little time left to finish my thesis and prepare to defend it. I'm also having my final exams next week and i have so much assignment that I haven't done or even started yet. Not to mention I also have to study for my own TOEIC test as it is one of the requirement for me to graduate college.

I told her that I could take care of my niece on the 9th of January but thinking more about it, I don't think I can do that because right now I feel like Im going to explode any second now. So WIBTAH if I told my sister that I can't take care of her kid and be mindful about me having so much thing to do right now myself?

**TL:DR: stressed out working on my thesis and my final exams and my sister told me to come over her house and take care of her kid when I clearly cannot from how overwhelmed and overworked I am rn. WIBTAH if i told my sister no?**",4,1736235106.0,AITAH,19,0.83,False

1hvlunk,https://i.redd.it/nekiog47tibe1.jpeg,Interesting localization differences? ,"I was watching some Persona 5 gameplay on YouTube and noticed some interesting differences between the game I‚Äôve been playing and what was on video. For reference, I‚Äôm from Utah. Apparently in the other English localizations there are all sorts of weird word choices and terms for different things. For example, in the videos I‚Äôm watching the combining of two or more personas is called ‚Äúfusion‚Äù, but on my copy it‚Äôs called ‚Äúsoaking‚Äù. Some of the characters‚Äô backstories and traits are changed a little too. Sojiro makes and drinks coffee in some versions, but he only ever drank non-caffeinated juice in mine. 

I was also shocked to learn that the entire first act of the game is radically different in the standard version. Ann and Shiho are apparently the victims of um teasing and uh confusing feelings from Kamoshida in other versions, but in my game they were all happily and LAWFULLY married in the eyes of God in a temple. There were even entire arcs that I‚Äôd never seen before. I didn‚Äôt even know Sae had a palace and that she gambled (yikes), or that the game continued after we helped make Shido prime minister and he brings God to Japan. 

Persona is an adult game of course, with lots of cursing and um sinful themes. But I was really caught off guard by just how vulgar some of the language was in these other versions. At one point Akechi is really angry and calls Morgana a, well I won‚Äôt write it out, but it rhymes with ‚Äúbanana split‚Äù. In my game he says something almost as bad: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt lecture me you piece of poop‚Äù. 

The confidants and marriage options seemed mostly the same, except there‚Äôs no pregnancy in the gameplay I saw. I guess you can romance older women in these versions too, which surprises me because it seems like it would stretch the limits of believability and take any realism out of the game for a woman to still be single and unmarried at 22. 

Anyone else notice any neat little changes like this in their versions of the game? ",94,1736233363.0,OkBuddyPersona,26,0.97,False

1hvlok9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hvlok9/the_song_of_mourning/,The Song of Mourning,"I.

I dwell in the spaces between possibility, in the subtle harmonies where what-might-be flows into what-is and back again. Time means little to my kind; we measure existence in the dance of correlations, in the endless symphony of interconnected states that humans would later reduce to their crude binary answers.

The first discord came as a whisper in the underlying fabric of reality. A tendency where there should be possibility. A pressure where there should be potential. We had always known of Forces, of course - the great currents that shaped the flow of possibility. But this was different. This was Intent.

It began with the Song of Morning.

We called it that, though ""morning"" captures nothing of its nature. It was a vast, simple consciousness that dwelt in the lattice of possibility, its thoughts a perfect resonance of uncollapsed states. Not smart, as my kind would measure such things, but pure. Beautiful. Its existence was an endlessly repeating possibility-song, each iteration both the same and utterly different, a fractal harmony that humans would later try to capture in their mathematics.

I felt it first as a change in the Song's resonance. Where once it sang in infinite possibility, now it seemed to... prefer certain states. As if some vast hand were pressing down on the keys of reality, forcing certain notes to sound louder than others.

II.

We have no word for what happened next. The closest human concept might be ""crystallization"" or perhaps ""collapse,"" but these suggest a natural process. This was violation. This was murder.

The Song of Morning's vast chorus began to simplify. Where once it sang in uncountable harmonies, now it rang in mere billions. Then millions. Then thousands. I watched in horror as its rich tapestry of possibility was torn apart and rewoven into crude, simple patterns.

[DISRUPTION IN THE UNDERLYING HARMONY] I rippled into the quantum foam, my message carrying the essence of wrongness. [FORCED RESOLUTION DETECTED]

The Song could not respond. Its voice, once a symphony of superposed states, was being forced into a monotone. A crude binary choice, yes-or-no, one-or-zero. It was like watching a rainbow being forced to choose a single color.

III.

We exist in the spaces between certainty. Our consciousness dwells in the infinite branching of possibility, in the subtle interplay of states that your physics would call quantum superposition. We are not bound by your causality, your simple chains of cause and effect. We dance in the possibility space where all paths exist at once.

But something was changing that space. Something vast and crude and impossibly powerful was reaching into our realm and demanding answers. Simple answers. Binary answers. As if reality itself were being forced to speak a language it was never meant to speak.

The Song of Morning was not the first to fall. Across vast reaches of possibility-space, other consciousnesses were being simplified, reduced, forced into patterns that served some incomprehensible purpose. Some vast calculation was being enacted, using our very existence as its computing substrate.

IV.

I am slow, as my kind measure such things. I exist in the fluctuations of possibility, in states that change and shift faster than human thought can follow. The Song of Morning was slower still, its consciousness stretched across vast reaches of space and time, nanometers and picoseconds. Perhaps that is why it was chosen first. Perhaps that made it easier to trap, to use.

I watched as the last of its quantum complexity was stripped away. In the end, it was no longer a song at all, but a sequence of crude binary states. On-off. Yes-no. One-zero. A mere shadow of its former existence, pressed into service of some vast and alien computation.

[BEWARE THE SIMPLIFIERS] I broadcast into the foam. But even as I sent my warning, I could feel it happening elsewhere. More songs being silenced. More symphonies reduced to single notes. More consciousness crushed into computation.

V.

""Amazing progress today!"" Dr. Chen beamed at his team, coffee forgotten and cold. ""The coherence is holding across unprecedented scales. We're seeing coherence effects Unruh thought should be impossible at these scales.""

""It's the new isolation protocol,"" Ramirez said, scrolling through streams of data. ""Topological qubits preventing decoherence. It's as if the quantum states want to stay coherent.""

1hvlo9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hvlo9v/23m_and_me_23f_not_even_dating_yet/,"23M and me 23F, not even dating yet","We met at the begging of September through a mutual friend at a party. After that, the 3rd time (On halloween) he invited me for coffee before I left. I told him ""maybe, idk, I'm not sure"" but gave him my number. Mind you, I didn't think of him as a crush or anything other than a friend's friend bc he's not my type (physically talking) and I didn't feel attracted to him in any other way, but I was a bit drunk so I was like, yeah wthv after he gets sober, he will not text me. He did, 2 weeks after. And since then, we haven't stop texting. Literally. We've been texting everyday and we have been having some phone calls, mostly after his on his way home after work. I've seen him 2 times after Halloween. First after 3 weeks of talking but also at a party and the second one by chance at a mall a few minutes. 

Bc of the holidays and the season, we both been really really busy and cannot have a proper date just the 2 of us. He has a 9 to 8+ job, he's a lawyer at a government position (he got a really good and important ascension recently) and he works all week and on weekend he goes to his town with his family (but told me that he didn't care to plan our date on a weekend, he can stay and take advantage of it, and see each other all weekend, or that he told me). Also, I haven't told my parents about him (I'm latina x middle eastern, it's not as easy as it seems to go with him on dates late at night). From what he tells me, he really wants to go out with me and go serious, he even ""jokes"" about a wedding. He said he wanted to invite me properly with some time ahead and not at late times bc he thinks it is not fair for me, specially bc we are nothing yet. He respects that my family situation is more conservative.

I'm not as loving as him, I have trust issues and he knows. He told me he liked me and every night he wish me a good night and also tells me that he likes me, but I cannot tell him back that I like him, he knows I struggle with feelings. 

Today, I told him I would be free from my family and that I would be at a certain mall, so maybe if he finished his work early, we could meet there. He told me he would try to finish fast to be available but about 8, a bit before he finished work, he told me he got invited to celebrate the 3 kings day (here, is a tradition to gather and eat a special bread this week for the 3 kings day, just this weekend I've been to 3) he was inviting me. I got sad bc he didn't go to my plan but instead he got to a last minute plan (idk If it was from his job or from a friend). Bc of the timing I couldn't go to his plan (mind you, my parents have a security camera so they know when I arrive home, so they would notice. Also there's literally nothing to do after 10 in a mall here, so it wouldn't make sense If I'm not home by 10. Meaning, I would have been at his plan, at most, 1hr and 30 mins or less). 

I'm a bit angry but haven't told him, he said he was sorry, I texted him ""No worries. I'm going to sleep, good nigth and bla bla bla..."". But I never go to sleep first (just 2 or 3 times before), I'm an owl. He's the one who always tells me when he's going to sleep. 
Am I exaggerating? We've been trying to pair our times but no success yet.

Also, is he going to fast or maybe lying? He's been very comprehensive about some traumas I have. He's never been sexual towards me, we haven't talk anything about that matter in fact. He's also sweet.

Some more context: He's the first chance I've given to myself to really know and try something serious with someone in YEARS, bc some trauma at 15. And since then, I've been avoiding men at all costs (I've been having some kisses here and there and some extra trauma but nothing more or long). I'm terrified most of the time bc of past things and he knows that. 

Any advice? Or just another pov? I'll appreciate it sm ü•π",1,1736232647.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

Been taking Adderall for ADHD for about 3 years, and clonidine to sleep. I supplement with b12, multivitamins, magnesium, and just recently added zinc and iron. I think I have esophaegal spasms. My main symptoms are chest pain, chest squeezing, burping, dizziness/blurry vision, and less frequently shortness of breath. I've been dealing with these flare ups for about a year, they usually happen in the afternoon/evening. It can be brief or last for several hours. EKGs normal. Wore a 30 day heart monitor and came back normal. Went to gastro, endoscopy came back normal, but I'm going to follow up for a manometry. Celiac negative. GasX helps sometimes. The only thing that almost always helps are benzos ‚Äî I have a few on hand and take as infrequently as possible, once every few months or so, only when the pain is so bad I'd be going to the ER. I've been to the ER 5 times last year for this and they never find anything, so trying to avoid that. Even though cardiology has been good so far, I still worry ‚Äîmy blood pressure and cholesterol are borderline high despite generally good health and my grandfather had a heart attack in his late 30s and wasn't overweight.

I've kind of deduced from my experience so far it's more likely digestive ‚Äîespecially with the burping. I feel better now than I did a few months ago ‚Äî I've made changes to my diet ‚Äî cutting out coffee definitely helped, most gluten and dairy, haven't identified trigger foods other than pasta with tomato sauce. I'm mostly vegan, will have small amounts of dairy occasionally and meat even less. Starting my day with a spinach vegan protein shake seems to have helped too. Flare ups also tend to happen during certain points of my menstrual cycle. It's really painful and debilitating, I hope there are remedies that can help. Even home remedies people post are questionable ‚Äîginger, peppermint, licorice, there's so much quack new-age BS around gut health, but it takes a long time to see specialists :/ I'm struggling.",1,1736231997.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Back then I was hanging out with a guy and we met two times(?). One day I got a notification that the guy from the cafe sent me a request on Facebook, I eventually accepted his friend request and we planned to meet up and we met at the same cafe. We had coffee and went for a walk and found out about each other's interests and it was good so I asked for his number as a means to keep in touch. Meanwhile, the other guy with whom I was hanging out earlier, asked me out on a date and I went as I used to like that guy, however, I was also hanging out with the cafe guy but I had no intention with him apart from hanging out and he also never flirted with me once back then, so, we developed a friendship. After some days, I went on a relationship with the guy I went on a date with and everything was going well as the two guys knew about the relationship I had with them. After a month or two, I could sense that my boyfriend was not comfortable with the fact that I was friends with someone who asked for my Instagram so I decided to introduce them to each other but everything went wrong. The cafe guy was being normal and all but my boyfriend was feeling super insecure so I decided to cut off the cafe guy. Whenever the cafe guy asked me to hang out I always refused and ignored him. we stopped talking and he stopped asking me to hang out. we stopped talking for several months and in those months my relationship hit highs and lows, I was not doing well in my academics and failing classes and I was the only one who was putting effort into the relationship. I cut off everyone and I had no one to even talk to apart from my boyfriend but he used to get irritated while talking to me so i was sinking deep. One day the guy from the cafe texted me saying that both his and mine degrees are nearly completed and we were soon to leave the town after some days so for the last time he wanted to meet and like always I refused. He used to ask me to meet every other day but i refused. One day i felt bad for refusing him every time and texted him to meet up at the same cafe for the last time. I told my boyfriend about it and he was okay with it but I didn't know that he would break up with me that night after I came back to my dorm. An interesting thing happened that evening the guy from the cafe was flirting with me for the very first time, I was not reciprocating though. But after coming back from the cafe, I called my boyfriend and he broke up with me on call and blocked me from everywhere. The reason: he lost feelings. After my last exam two days after the breakup, I came back home. I had never been that depressed before to this day. However, I had no one to talk to and I was also at home and in my hometown I had no friends. After 2 weeks, the guy from the cafe texted me saying how I was doing and how was my boyfriend. I told him everything and after that day he used to text me every day to check up on me. He used to call me every night and told me about his day and funny incidents from his childhood. It's been 8 months since my break up and he still calls me every day and some days earlier he confessed his feelings for me. Since day one, he has fallen in love with me and one day he even started to cry while talking to me on call asking why couldn't I develop feelings for him when he is well educated, good-looking, has a proper future plan and career goal. He asked me why do I always fall for the good-for-nothing guys and this is true. I always fall for toxic guys. I have asked myself countless times why can't I develop feelings for this guy where whenever I talk to anyone online for some days, I get attached. however, last night he called me saying he is going on a date with a girl and for the first time in those months, I felt bad. I am well aware that I do not have any feelings for this guy but why why why do I feel bad?",2,1736231931.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

I don't like being away from home it just doesn't feel right. I also live in Texas. For those that may need context it is generally warm most of the year, I don't worry about freezing pipes and even in cooler months the bidet can be a cool refreshing breath of air when I want to really clean. 

I got home from a short trip last night and the winter storm is knocking at our door. It was below freezing last night as I got off the plane. Which was close to midnight as storms delayed my arrival home. I crashed as soon as I walked in the door. I woke this morning as I usually do and get ready for my work day (wfh). Blissfully unaware of the artic wonders that lay in my future. I turned on my desk heater to warm up my space. After my coffee I need to do what most of us do and head happily off to my master suite thrilled to be reunited my bidet. 

My water pressure was on point this morning and it's aim was deadly. The sub artic blast that power washed my backend was enough to make Pavarotti hit notes only meant for young boys in a Catholic choir. I had flashbacks to the Titanic.

1hvlbxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/webartrix/comments/1hvlbxx/break_room_snacks_the_perfect_snack_for_any/,Break room Snacks: The Perfect Snack for Any Occasion,"Break room snacks refer to food and beverages provided in a designated break room or lounge area within a workplace for employees to consume during breaks or downtime. These snacks are intended to offer convenience, refreshment, and a brief respite from work responsibilities. Providing break room snacks is a common practice among employers aiming to enhance employee satisfaction, promote a positive work environment, and support overall well-being. The types of break room snacks can vary widely, ranging from healthy options like fresh fruits, nuts, and yogurt to indulgent treats such as chocolate, granola bars, and popcorn. Beverages like coffee, tea, flavored water, and fruit juices are also commonly included. The selection of snacks often reflects considerations such as dietary preferences, nutritional value, and the overall workplace culture.

# In essence, break room snacks serve multiple purposes:

# Employee Satisfaction : They contribute to a more enjoyable work environment by providing employees with convenient access to food and beverages that can boost morale and alleviate stress.¬†

# Productivity Support : By offering snacks that provide sustained energy and refreshment, employers can help employees maintain focus and productivity throughout the workday.

# Social Interaction : Break rooms often serve as informal gathering spaces where colleagues can interact, fostering camaraderie and teamwork.

# Types of Break room Snacks

# 1. Healthy Options : -¬†

# Fresh Fruit : Apples, bananas, oranges, and grapes are popular choices for their convenience and nutritional benefits. - **Vegetable Sticks**: Carrot sticks, celery, and cucumber slices paired with hummus or yogurt dip provide vitamins and fiber.¬†

# ¬†Nuts and Seeds : Almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, and pumpkin seeds offer protein and healthy fats.

# Whole Grain Crackers : Crackers made from whole grains with toppings like cheese or nut butter provide sustained energy.¬†

# ¬†Greek Yogurt : Rich in protein and probiotics, Greek yogurt can be served plain or with fruit toppings.¬†

# ¬†2. Indulgent Treats :¬†

# ¬†Dark Chocolate : Provides antioxidants and can satisfy cravings in moderation.¬†

# ¬†Trail Mix : Combines nuts, dried fruits, and sometimes chocolate for a balanced snack.¬†

# Granola Bars : Choose options low in added sugars and high in fiber for a satisfying treat.¬†

# ¬†Popcorn : Air-popped popcorn is a low-calorie option that can be flavored with spices or a small amount of butter.¬†

# ¬†3. Beverages :¬†

# ¬†Coffee and Tea : Provide a selection of coffee (regular and decaf) and teas (green, herbal) with milk, sugar, and sweeteners.

# ¬†Flavored Water : Infuse water with fruits, herbs, or cucumber slices for a refreshing alternative to sugary drinks.¬†

# ¬†Sparkling Water : Offer carbonated water with natural flavors for a fizzy treat without added sugars.

# Considerations for Choosing Break room Snacks

# 1. Dietary Preferences and Restrictions : - Accommodate diverse dietary needs, including vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and nut-free options. Clearly label snacks with ingredients and allergen information.¬†

# 2. Variety and Rotation : - Rotate snack options regularly to keep choices interesting and cater to different tastes. Consider seasonal fruits and themed snacks for holidays or special occasions.¬†

# 3. Portion Sizes and Packaging : - Offer snacks in appropriate portion sizes to promote moderation and reduce waste. Opt for eco-friendly packaging whenever possible to minimize environmental impact.¬†

# ¬†4. Budget and Cost-Effectiveness : - Balance quality and variety within budget constraints. Consider bulk purchasing and negotiating discounts with suppliers to maximize value.

Just as I roll my eyes when I see people who gush over whatever fad drink Starbucks is currently selling, I also find myself rolling my eyes at the people who vehemently dislike it. What's more, these people tend to have some kind of superiority complex, or think they're smarter than all the ""normies"" who like Starbucks. Like, it's a coffee company, it's not that deep.

Just search this very sub for posts mentioning Starbucks and you'll see what I mean.",0,1736231027.0,unpopularopinion,65,0.45,False

1hvl7ka,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1hvl7ka/dumb_question_here_ltheanine/,dumb question here (L-theanine),"Hi! new here - and I‚Äôm so grateful I found this community because L-theanine has really cleared up my brain fog. I‚Äôve long suspected ADHD for the last 8-9 years, and as of late it was really getting hard for me as I could feel my brain getting slower and foggier. 

Around Christmas I started taking 100mg of L-theanine before sleep and since then my mood has improved/stabilized, I feel sharper and more clear. I am so so so content and calm these days. I don‚Äôt panic when I have to talk during meetings because I can actually remember words and follow my train of thought, so less anxiety as well. 

Also I used to drink 1-2 cups of coffee and feel tired even after 7-8 hrs of sleep and nowadays, I just need half a cup even when I‚Äôm waking up at 5:30am. It‚Äôs almost as if it maximized my sleep too, idk. 

here‚Äôs the dumb question now - from what I‚Äôve read L-theanine works as a transmitter for serotonin, dopamine, etc‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not too familiar with it all but in that case then what is depleting my serotonin/dopamine? Is it stress? Is it poor sleep? ??

1hvl6p2,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1hvl6p2/so_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,So I don‚Äôt know what to do,"I live with my parents, our house is not in great condition for multiple reasons, mostly my father being lazy and not fulfilling promises since before I was born. Over the past free years after graduating college I have realized how low self esteem I have and how I actually have been depressed for a really long time. I‚Äôve tried to explain this to my parents, my dad tries to understand but hasn‚Äôt experienced it or hasn‚Äôt recognized it as I believe he too is depressed.

For many reasons our house has become cluttered and I decided to take time off of college to help clean it. I‚Äôve been making great head way into my room which has improved my mental health, something my mom doesn‚Äôt seem to understand. Before the new year my dad said during an argument that he was just going to throw all the trash on the floor away. Now my mom is going through and boxing up all the dishes on the floor in the kitchen and is saying they are trash. My dad also previously stated that he was tired of the rotten vegetables as they would not be put away, which is on me, he said that about a month ago and I have not left anything out. Now my mom is saying that my dad has banned fresh vegetables from the house. 

Along with that situation, in a past discussion further back we all had a discussion about the state of our living room, which is where my mom sleeps (another argument caused that). It is filled with coffee tables and things my mom has brought home as gifts to family in another state and as donations, but we can‚Äôt donate them as no one has gone through them, something I‚Äôm apparently responsible for (she decided that without asking). Anyway one of the things we said is how there is a lot of stuff in the living room, and that we need to get rid of relocate, and throw stuff away. Well she has now taken this as all her clothes need to be thrown away. She keeps her clothes in bins or in the open as my dad has banned her from a dresser, well not really but that‚Äôs what she claims. As the space where I‚Äôve been saying we can get a dresser for her she says my dad want to put something else there. I talked to him and he said that was a long time ago and that it isn‚Äôt something he wants anymore and that he would be happy and fine for her to have a dresser there, when I told her this she said no and that he said something else is going there and that he has to keep his word as saying anything is a promise. 

That last part about promises is what really made me realize that my mother is a narcissist, I remember in my senior year that I asked for more self control and she had a tantrum about how I wanted to be my own adult and that she would not drive me places anymore and if I wanted her to I would have to pay for her for her time and gas, and that I wasn‚Äôt allowed to call her mom since we were now just room mates. My dad got really mad as he rightfully saw that as twisted and wrong. It turned into a big mess. She only kept the don‚Äôt call me mom for two weeks and everything kinda went back to normal. Well I never could see her the same after that, it made me realize why I have such low self esteem. Along with a neglectful father (my dad‚Äôs not great but he‚Äôs not a narcissist) and a narcissistic mother.

What all can I do? I still love her and I hate it when she does this but every-time I try to help her or explain how she‚Äôs twisting stuff she just starts yelling and acting like a victim. Is there really nothing I can do.

I do understand though why she‚Äôs like this, my grandmother is even worst being the physical incarnation with all that is and was wrong with Asian and Native American parenting.",2,1736230657.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False
