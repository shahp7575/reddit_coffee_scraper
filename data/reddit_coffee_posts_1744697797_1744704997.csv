I got a mod message from the ON sub basically saying that I was spamming (but I wasn’t trying to). I made a post and it kept getting auto deleted even though it seemed I was eligible to post there. So I kept trying to modify the post and go over the rules to get it right and when I woke up the next morning I seen that it was disabled, which I didn’t know could happen. I thought I would just be kicked from the sub.

But anyways, there were a few questions I couldn’t answer because of that so I wanted to clarify because as I said, beggars can’t be choosers. 

My previous account was linked to my phone number and this one is linked to my email. I haven’t posted on this account before but I’ve been using it to read up on local resources and what not.

Someone asked me why I asked for Airbnb gift cards. The reason I thought to ask for gift cards was because I know a lot of people don’t want to reveal their identity. I also wanted people to know that I intended on using it specifically for a roof over my head. There’s the type of folks who will give change to a homeless person, and the type who will offer to buy them food or a coffee (both are still kind actions). I just wanted people to know where their help is going and to give them the assurance that I didn’t make anything up.

Some people commented that they’d help or that they wanted to DM but then never responded when I reached out. Nevertheless I really appreciate those of you who reached out and offered to help me. 

I’m still in very much need of assistance. I mentioned that I couldn’t even afford to get to work last week and because of that, my pay is going to be super short. I know all of this is just until May, but I’m so stressed out and tired to be honest.

I’m just trying to stay afloat and it’s a lot, but what’s 2 and a half more weeks I guess?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div> Maintaining your septic tank properly is essential to avoid costly repairs and unpleasant situations. While regular pumping is the most effective way to keep your septic system functioning well, there are several effective daily habits you can adopt to make your septic tank last longer without pumping as frequently. these habits into your routine will help slow down sludge buildup, reduce blockages, and protect your system’s overall health.

### Be Mindful of What You Flush or Drain

 One of the most critical habits for extending the life of your septic tank is controlling what goes down your drains and toilets. Avoid flushing or pouring harmful substances, as they can disrupt the natural bacterial balance in your tank and cause damage to the system.

- **Avoid flushing:** wipes (even “flushable” ones), feminine hygiene products, paper towels, cigarette butts, and other non-biodegradable items.
- **Don’t pour chemicals down sinks:** household cleaners, paint, motor oil, and medications can kill beneficial bacteria needed for breaking down waste in your septic tank.
- **Limit fats, oils, and grease:** these substances can solidify and clog pipes, causing backups and reducing tank capacity.
 
### Use Water Wisely to Prevent Overloading

 Water use affects the flow of wastewater into your septic tank and drain field. Overloading the system with too much water can cause solids to move into the drain field, which leads to blockages and early failure.

- **Fix leaks immediately:** dripping faucets and running toilets waste water and strain your septic system continuously.
- **Spread out laundry loads:** instead of doing several full loads in one day, spread them throughout the week to avoid overwhelming the tank.
- **Use low-flow fixtures:** installing water-efficient showerheads, faucets, and toilets reduces water usage and minimizes strain on your septic system.
 
### Promote Healthy Bacteria Growth

 Beneficial bacteria play a vital role inside your septic tank by breaking down solid waste. Keeping these bacteria thriving can delay the need for pumping and enhance your system’s performance.

- **Use septic-safe products:** Choose laundry detergents and household cleaners labeled ""septic-safe"" or biodegradable to avoid harming bacteria.
- **Limit use of antibacterial soaps:** While hygienic, these soaps can disrupt bacterial populations when used excessively.
- **Consider adding natural bacterial additives:** Some homeowners use enzyme-based treatments to boost bacteria activity — but always check with your septic professional before starting any additives.
 
### Maintain Your Drain Field

 The drain field is where treated wastewater disperses into the soil. Protecting this area complements your efforts to extend the life of your septic tank by preventing saturation and damage.

- **Avoid parking or driving heavy vehicles:** Heavy weight compresses the soil, which reduces absorption and can cause drain field failure.
- **Plant only grass or shallow-rooted plants:** Deep roots from trees and shrubs can penetrate and damage the septic system pipes.
- **Make sure gutters and runoff aren’t draining toward the field:** Excess water from rain could saturate the drain field and compromise its ability to treat wastewater.
 
### Regular Monitoring and Minor Maintenance

 Keeping a close eye on your system’s performance can help you identify and address issues before they become serious problems. Even without pumping, periodic inspections coupled with minor maintenance extend your septic tank’s lifespan.

- **Watch for slow drains or gurgling sounds:** These often signal a clog or other blockage.
- **Smell for odors around your septic tank or drain field:** Foul smells indicate waste is not being properly treated or dispersed.
- **Check the tank access regularly:** Remove the lid safely to look for excessive scum or sludge buildup and consult professionals when unsure.
 
 By adapting these practical daily habits, you’ll help keep your septic tank in good working condition longer—even without immediate pumping. The key lies in protecting the bacterial ecosystem in your septic tank, reducing unnecessary water and waste load, and preventing damage to associated components like the drain field. Over time, these small but consistent actions add up to major savings and a healthier home environment.

</div>Common Mistakes That Speed Up Septic Tank Fill-Up and How to Avoid Them
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Ignoring What Goes Down the Drain

One of the biggest mistakes that can cause your septic tank to fill up faster is treating it like a trash can. Flushing non-biodegradable items such as plastics, wipes labeled “flushable,” feminine hygiene products, or even coffee grounds can clog the system and lead to faster sludge accumulation. These materials don’t break down easily, which means your septic tank fills up with solids quicker than it should.

To protect your septic system, only flush human waste and toilet paper designed to dissolve easily. Items like dental floss, cigarette butts, and cooking grease should never enter the septic system. Instead, dispose of these items in the trash or recycle where possible.

### Overloading the System with Excess Water

Using more water than your septic system is designed to handle is a common problem. Everyday activities such as laundry, long showers, and multiple toilets flushing within a short period can overwhelm your tank. Excess water prevents solids from settling properly, causing them to move into the drain field and fill the tank faster.

You can slow down this overfill by spreading out water use throughout the day. Fixing leaks, using water-efficient appliances, and turning off taps when not in use reduces the volume your septic tank must handle. Avoid running several water-intensive devices simultaneously. Your goal should be to maintain a balanced flow that gives your tank time to process waste effectively.

### Not Maintaining the Drain Field

Many people focus solely on keeping the tank itself clean but forget about caring for the drain field. This area allows treated liquid to filter through the soil, and its health is vital to your septic system’s longevity. Driving heavy vehicles or planting trees with aggressive roots over the drain field can cause damage or blockages, which forces the septic tank to fill up more quickly as waste backs up.

Protect your drain field by restricting access to vehicles, keeping deep-rooted plants away, and avoiding constructing structures on top of it. Planting grass instead of large shrubs or trees helps keep the soil stable while allowing proper drainage and oxygenation.

### Delaying Regular Inspections and Maintenance

It is a mistake to delay routine septic inspections. Even if you are cautious about water use and waste disposal, your system still benefits from professional check-ups. Without periodic inspections, small issues like early sludge buildup or leaks can go unnoticed, accelerating your septic tank’s fill-up rate.

Scheduling professional septic inspections every 3 to 5 years allows for early detection of problems and timely pumping to remove excess solids. This routine maintenance is a small investment compared to costly repairs or complete system replacements caused by neglect.

### Using Harsh Chemicals Excessively

Using large amounts of household chemicals such as bleach, drain cleaners, and antibacterial soaps may seem like a good hygiene practice, but they can damage the beneficial bacteria inside your septic tank. These bacteria play a crucial role in breaking down solid waste. Without them, solid matter accumulates faster, causing your system to fill up prematurely.

Try to limit the use of harsh household cleaners and switch to septic-safe, biodegradable products. Avoid dumping paints, solvents, or motor oils down any drains, as these substances harm both your septic system and the surrounding environment.

### Neglecting to Use Additives Wisely

Many people mistakenly believe that chemical additives or enzymes can replace regular pumping or fix a failing septic system. While some additives may help maintain bacterial balance, relying on them to eliminate solids or sludge buildup can be problematic.

Use additives only as part of a balanced septic maintenance plan, not as a quick fix. Always follow product instructions carefully and consult with septic professionals before adding any chemicals to the system.

### Additional Tips to Prolong Your Septic Tank Life

- Install a trash bin near toilets to encourage proper disposal of non-flushable items.
- Educate family members about what is safe to flush and pour down drains.
- Repair leaking faucets and toilets promptly to reduce unnecessary water flow.
- Use water-efficient appliances and fixtures to decrease daily water use.
- Avoid using garbage disposals frequently, as they increase the amount of solid waste entering the tank.
 
By avoiding these common mistakes and adopting responsible septic system habits, you can slow down the rate at which your septic tank fills up. This approach not only saves you money on pumping and repairs but also supports a healthier, longer-lasting septic system that functions efficiently.

</div>### Conclusion

Taking simple, consistent steps every day can significantly extend the life of your septic tank without the immediate need for pumping. By adopting effective daily habits—such as reducing water waste, properly disposing of household waste, and monitoring what goes down your drains—you play a crucial role in maintaining your system’s health. These small adjustments help prevent excessive buildup and keep your septic tank functioning smoothly for years to come.

Equally important is understanding the common mistakes that cause your septic tank to fill up faster. Avoiding actions like flushing non-biodegradable items, pouring grease or harsh chemicals down the drain, and overloading the system with too much water at once can protect your tank from unnecessary strain. Awareness and care in what you introduce into your septic system lead to fewer problems and a longer lifespan for the tank.

By combining smart daily habits with mindful avoidance of damaging practices, you create a balanced approach that supports the natural breakdown process inside your septic tank. This balance reduces the frequency of pumping, saving you time and money while preventing costly repairs. Remember, the health of your septic system depends largely on your actions and choices at home, making you the best guardian of its longevity. Taking these simple steps today keeps your septic tank working well far into the future.

Got ready to drink my coffee and go for a run. I’ve been pretty consistent about this for the past few weeks and hit a wall today when I found out my brother had a fairly serious injury and has to have emergency surgery. I immediately tossed my coffee out, paced, tried to distract myself with work and ran some errands.

Zep had been helping me get over emotional eating but I think the bad news as well as my new 7.5 prescription being delayed until 5 days after my typical shot day has me at an unexpected emotional low.

Mushroom coffee is gaining popularity for its unique blend of traditional coffee and medicinal mushrooms. Many people are curious about its potential benefits, including weight loss. One of the key components of mushroom coffee is caffeine, which has been linked to weight loss in several ways. Let’s explore how caffeine can help with weight loss, starting with its effects on the body.

# Effects Of Caffeine

Caffeine is a well-known stimulant found in coffee, tea, and many energy drinks. It affects the central nervous system, leading to increased alertness and reduced fatigue. But how does this relate to weight loss?

Caffeine can boost metabolism. This means your body burns calories faster, even at rest. Several studies have shown that caffeine can increase metabolic rate by 3-11%, which can help in weight management.

Here are some key effects of caffeine:

* **Increased Thermogenesis:** Caffeine promotes the production of heat in the body, leading to more calories burned.
* **Appetite Suppression:** Caffeine can reduce the feeling of hunger, helping you consume fewer calories.
* **Improved Fat Oxidation:** Caffeine helps in breaking down fats and using them as a source of energy.

These effects make caffeine a useful ally in the journey to lose weight. Understanding these benefits can help you make informed choices about incorporating mushroom coffee into your diet.

# Energy Boost For Exercise

Exercise is a crucial part of any weight loss program. Caffeine can enhance your workout performance by providing an energy boost. This increase in energy can help you exercise longer and more intensely.

Here’s how caffeine boosts exercise performance:

* **Enhanced Focus:** Caffeine improves mental alertness, helping you stay focused during workouts.
* **Increased Endurance:** Caffeine reduces the perception of effort, allowing you to exercise for extended periods.
* **Reduced Muscle Pain:** Caffeine can lower the sensation of muscle pain, making it easier to push through tough workouts.

To illustrate, let’s look at a comparison of exercise performance with and without caffeine:

|Aspect|Without Caffeine|With Caffeine|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Duration|30 minutes|45 minutes|
|Intensity|Moderate|High|
|Focus|Average|Enhanced|

Incorporating mushroom coffee into your routine can provide these benefits. This can help you maximize your workouts and achieve your weight loss goals faster.

But looking back, was it ever a super enjoyable experience, or have we just romanticized the past to avoid facing the current dumpster fire of modern dating? Chivalry has been replaced by Venmo requests, “Do you want to come over and vibe?” and women who are “just here for the free dinner… or drinks.”


But something else has shifted. Dating isn’t just about swiping anymore—it’s about redefining relationships entirely. The rise of polyamory and ethical non-monogamy (ENM) has reshaped the conversation, making it one of the fastest-growing alternative lifestyles in urban centers.

Gone are the days of simply complaining about ghosting on Hinge. Now, you’re on Feeld, debating whether ‘relationship anarchy’ is a genuine rejection of hierarchy, a convenient way to dodge accountability—or worse, both.

POLYAMORY 101: A LOVE BUFFET, NOT A FREE-FOR-ALL

Polyamory isn’t just some bohemian fantasy where everyone is fooling around in a field of flowers (though Coachella influencer Communes seem one microdose away from a free-love experiment). It’s in mainstream media, therapist offices, and, most importantly, your dating apps.

Unlike casual non-monogamy (which is mostly about sex), polyamory is about building multiple meaningful connections—ethically, consensually, and transparently.

Some of the most common arrangements include:

Hierarchical Polyamory – A relationship structure where partners have different levels of priority. Cute, but I’ll be damned if I’m somebody’s side chick.
Non-Hierarchical Polyamory – No “ranking,” just “vibes”—until someone catches feelings and suddenly those vibes require a group calendar.
Solo Polyamory – Full emotional investment, zero logistical ties. No merging finances, no shared leases, and absolutely no debates about which laundry detergent to buy. Because honestly? I barely have time to manage my own schedule, let alone someone else’s feelings—between balancing an FTJ and ample side hustle projects, emotional labor is a luxury I can’t afford.
Relationship Anarchy – The cool, punk-sounding version where labels don’t matter, which can be either a revolutionary rejection of societal norms or or just a fancy way to say, “I make up the rules as I go.“
And then there’s Feeld—where polyamory meets dating app culture in a way that’s both refreshing and deeply chaotic.

THE BIG PLAYER DATING APPS ARE DYING.
Once upon a time, Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, and even Raya were the places where our collective dating trauma played out. And oh, the stories we could tell.

Tinder? A post-apocalyptic wasteland of men who say “down for whatever” but mean “please do all the emotional labor for me.”
Bumble? A feminist experiment in emotionally unavailable men—because we were all hopeful that giving women the first move would change something.
Hinge? Where people claim to be looking for something serious but still won’t ask you a single question about yourself.
Raya? A networking event disguised as a dating app, where the most eligible bachelors live in Bali six months out of the year and are “between projects.”
Enter Feeld, the app that finally acknowledged what we all knew:

People are out here experimenting.
Monogamy isn’t the default anymore.
Some of us would rather be in a triad than endure another coffee date where a guy says he’s “not looking for anything serious.”
Feeld is where the ethically non-monogamous, poly-curious, kink-friendly, and emotionally intelligent come out to play. It’s refreshing and terrifying all at once. Instead of mindlessly swiping on people who just want a relationship, you’re swiping through people in relationships who want you in their relationship. Man, this would never fly back home.

And don’t even get me started on 3Fun, where half the profiles are just torso shots with bios that say, “Looking for a third 😉.”

IS POLYAMORY JUST SERIAL CHEATING WITH BETTER PR?
Polyamory, when done right, is about communication, self-awareness, and mutual respect. Advocating for yourself and possession of airtight negotiation skills are essential. But let’s be clear—polyamory does not get you away from relationship dysfunction, no matter what arrangement you are engaged in. You are still dealing with people, and therefore, will still encounter the same challenges of incompatibility, emotional unavailability, miscommunication, and relationship-opposing patterns, as spiritual teacher Teal Swan puts it-“People think they can escape relational dysfunction by changing relationship structures, but relationships are only ever as functional as the people in them.” Truer words have never been spoken.

So whether you’re monogamous, polyamorous, or somewhere in between, you’re still navigating the same emotional rollercoaster—just with a potentially larger cast.

There’s a huge difference between polyamory and avoiding accountability. Some people use ENM as a rebrand for avoiding responsibility. They love to say “I’m just following my truth” when what they really mean is “I believe in radical honesty—except when it comes to my last STD test.”

But let’s not pretend polyamory is the problem here. The issue is dating culture in general. We were all exhausted by monogamy, and polyamory isn’t a cure—it’s just a different way to navigate intimacy and romance.

THE NUMBERS DON’T LIE: POLYAMORY BY THE STATS
This isn’t just a vibe shift—it’s a documented trend.

📊 32% of urban Millennials and Gen Z have considered or practiced ethical non-monogamy (Kinsey Institute, 2023).
📊 One in nine Americans has engaged in some form of ENM (Journal of Sex Research, 2021).
📊 40% of poly individuals identify as bisexual or pansexual, meaning polyamory is often a place for sexual identity exploration (Kinsey Institute, 2023).

In Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco, these numbers skyrocket. Poly-friendly apps like Feeld and #Open are seeing massive surges in users.

Translation? If you’re single in LA, you’re dating poly people whether you want to or not.

INSIDE THE POLY UNDERGROUND: BOOK CLUBS, DISCORD GROUPS, AND SECRET PARTIES
Here’s where it gets interesting. Polyamory isn’t just an “app thing”—it’s a full-on subculture.

Discord servers host poly discussion nights, book clubs on attachment theory, and events on healthy boundaries (because, let’s be real, they’re necessary). Next they’ll be hosting Paint and Sips.
Private poly mixers in Silver Lake and WeHo are filled with curious monogamous couples and seasoned poly vets trying to figure out if you know what “kitchen table poly” means.
Secret house parties in the Hollywood Hills operate like invite-only salons, where the emotionally adventurous, the intellectually curious, and the very well-dressed mingle over espresso martinis (or in my case, mocktails).
These spaces feel more organic than swiping. You actually talk. You actually connect. And yet… it’s still dating, which means it can still be messy.

SO… IS POLYAMORY THE FUTURE OF DATING?
Will polyamory replace monogamy? Probably not. But is it growing because people are tired of deception, unspoken expectations, and false promises? Absolutely.

For some, polyamory is a revolutionary shift in how we approach love and commitment.
For others, it’s just a different kind of chaos.

But one thing is certain—the dating landscape has changed drastically from what feels like only a few years ago. We’ve gone from handwritten love letters to people ghosting you mid-text—what a time to be alive. The way we define relationships has expanded, yet the emotional pitfalls remain largely the same. Whether you’re on Feeld, Tinder, or trapped in a situationship that defies logic, the only thing that’s changed is the vocabulary we use to describe the confusion.

1jzlwu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1jzlwu3/betrayed_and_needing_advice/,"Betrayed, and needing advice","Apologies for the length of this post. Too many thoughts rattling around in my head, and I can't tell which are important.

TLDR: My wife cheated/is cheating, there are kids involved, as well as other complexities, and I'm hoping someone has some insight.

Me: 50M, roughly resemble Jabba the Hutt. Only he's cuter. I have severe osteoporosis, failed thyroid, severe spinal issues, and stage 3 cancer. My wife: 46F, could pose for Playboy. Us: Been together for many years, married in 2018, two kids, oldest is autistic. (Full disclosure, I'm on the spectrum myself; just not as far.)

My wife started working at the Louisville Whole Foods last year. She mainly does the 4-8am shifts. Due to my issues, combined with chasing two kids around, our sex life had dwindled to basically nothing. My consulting work has steadily dried up, and we have been in severe financial difficulty for quite a while. But I felt like we were working together ""as a team"" (as she puts it) and making progress.

Her work days all start the same; we both get up -- sometimes one oversleeps or the other, but again, we're a team, so it's all good -- and we have coffee together. It is a conscious ritual we've followed for years. It centers us. Or, so I thought. She gets in the car, drives to work, texts me she's arrived, and (presumably) goes in to work. They have a pretty strict no-text policy, so she doesn't text during her shift, so she always texts me right as her shift ends. (Which, due to her work, can vary a few minutes one way or the other.)

Several months ago, she suddenly showed up at home one day, and I realized two things. One, she was extraordinarily late, and two, she had not texted me. NBD, right? And then, I started noticing the following, among many other things: On Thursday and Fridays, she would always wear perfume (for a job where that's weird, to say the least). She started leaving the house twenty minutes early, with no explanation. And then I realized that on Thursdays and Fridays, she was also leaving work consistently fifteen to twenty minutes late, and not texting. She would get home, blast right past me and the kids, straight into the bathroom for five minutes. Then come out, like nothing had happened. She was talking one day about her day, and mentioned that she was having trouble with a coworker, but ""Braedon"" came over to see if she was ok. Braedon is some guy she works with, who used to be a manager, but got relieved of his duties for unspecific reasons. He had zero reason (that I can figure out) to be protective of her, and the work they do is timed, so whatever he was doing, he was taking time out of his tasking to worry about her? Ohhh-kay. And he's also engaged, so there's that.

After that incident, she stopped using names for any of the stories she told me. It went from ""Amanda had an annoying customer today"" to ""This girl I work with told me it's going to rain."" Zero names. And, suddenly, she doesn't work with any males. All her stories are female only.

Last week, we're at the grocery store. She leaves the kids and I to go grab a thing of yogurt (we're headed to the Hot Wheels aisle) and she comes back twenty-four minutes later. She acted like nothing happened. I asked why it took so long. Her reply: ""Oh, I ran into a girl I work with, and we just chatted for just a second.""

I said ok and told her I was going to take the kids to the car, could she handle checkout. She said yes and then stood waiting on me to walk off. I told her my back was hurting, so please go first. She walks halfway to the registers, then stops and looks around to see if we are behind her. She couldn't see me, then turns the cart around and starts to go in the other direction. I had had enough so I just yelled her name, and she turned around and blushed. She got angry and asked why I wasn't in the parking lot. I pointed out it was raining. She said ok, and then walked to the registers. (So...if it was innocuous, why didn't she continue doing whatever it was? Because it wasn't.)

There are dozens of those types of things, at this point.

And then last Saturday. I wasn't planning on confronting her, but it happened. A box of (two) pregnancy tests suddenly appeared in the very back of her medicine cabinet. Opened. I had had enough, so I asked her flat-out if she had cheated. She kept saying ""I have no idea what you're talking about"", over and over. She claims she's innocent. Claims the pregnancy tests are from years ago, but that somehow I had brought up the subject a few weeks ago, and she had taken one just to make sure. (Huh? We haven't had sex in months, so....right.)

The stories, lies, whatever went on and on. I told her it was fine and we can work through this. In the days since, she's suddenly turned into a sex machine. Her libido is off the charts. It is now, as it been for many years, nearly impossible for us to have sex that is in any way fulfilling for her. I am very, very small, in that department, and the health issues make it even more difficult to do anything. But she keeps trying, every day now. There's zero fulfillment for her, with me. My wishing things were different doesn't change that fact.

You've read this far, so here's the question. I think it's clear she's been cheating for a while. God and I have a very strong relationship, and I believe He had the grace to forgive me a lifetime of sins, so why shouldn't I be willing to forgive her. And, remember, I haven't been able to give her what she needs, so she's rightly suffering from me being unable to satisfy her needs. And speaking of me being stage 3, how much longer am I going to be around? Should I blow up our marriage, introduce a ton of trauma into our boys' lives, only to then have them lose their dad a little while later? Do I let her continue with this guy? What do I say to her? Do I set boundaries? At this late stage?

I honestly have zero clue how to move forward. We have been together so long that our friend base is now shared. I can't mention this to anyone without it getting around. And I don't want to destroy her life; I just want to figure out what is the right path forward for me, the kids, and her.

Last, but certainly not least, thank YOU, Reddit community, for any advice you have. This dad / husband / sucker / whatever will take it all on board and try to do the right thing.",0,1744702211.0,survivinginfidelity,1,0.5,False

1jzlrjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/aipromptprogramming/comments/1jzlrjq/googles_released_prompt_engineering_whitepaper/,💡 Google's Released Prompt Engineering whitepaper!!!,"Google's Released Prompt Engineering whitepaper!!!

Here are the top 10 techniques they recommend for 10x better AI results:

The quality of your AI outputs depends largely on how you structure your prompts. Even small wording changes can dramatically improve results.

Let me break down the techniques that actually work...

1)Show, don't tell (Few-shot prompting):  
Include examples in prompts for best results. Show the AI a good output format, don't just describe it.

""Write me a product description""  
""Here's an example of a product description: \[example\]. Now write one for my coffee maker.""

2)Chain-of-Thought prompting  
For complex reasoning tasks (math, logic, multi-step problems), simply adding ""Let's think step by step"" dramatically improves accuracy by 20-30%.

The AI shows its work and catches its own mistakes. Magic for problem-solving tasks!

3)Role prompting + Clear instructions  
Be specific about WHO the AI should be and WHAT they should do:  
""Tell me about quantum computing""  
""Act as a physics professor explaining quantum computing to a high school student. Use simple analogies and avoid equations.

4)Structured outputs  
Need machine-readable results? Ask for specific formats:  
""Extract the following details from this email and return ONLY valid JSON with these fields: sender\_name, request\_type, deadline, priority\_level""

5)Self-Consistency technique  
For critical questions where accuracy matters, ask the same question multiple times (5-10) with higher temperature settings, then take the most common answer.  
This ""voting"" approach significantly reduces errors on tricky problems.

6)Specific output instructions  
Be explicit about format, length, and style:

""Write about electric cars""  
""Write a 3-paragraph comparison of Tesla vs. Rivian electric vehicles. Focus on range, price, and charging network. Use a neutral, factual tone.""

7)Step-back prompting  
For creative or complex tasks, use a two-step approach:

1)First ask the AI to explore general principles or context  
2)Then ask for the specific solution using that context

This dramatically improves quality by activating relevant knowledge.

8) Contextual prompting  
Always provide relevant background information:

""Is this a good investment?""  
""I'm a 35-year-old with $20K to invest for retirement. I already have an emergency fund and no high-interest debt. Is investing in index funds a good approach?

9)ReAct (Reason + Act) method  
For complex tasks requiring external information, prompt the AI to follow this pattern:

Thought: \[reasoning\]  
Action: \[tool use\]  
Observation: \[result\]  
Loop until solved

Perfect for research-based tasks.

10)Experiment & document  
The whitepaper emphasizes that prompt engineering is iterative:

Test multiple phrasings  
Change one variable at a time  
Document your attempts (prompt, settings, results)  
Revisit when models update.

BONUS: Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE)

Mind-blowing technique: Ask the AI to generate multiple prompt variants for your task, then pick the best one.

""Generate 5 different ways to prompt an AI to write engaging email subject lines.""

AI is evolving from tools to assistants to agents. Mastering these prompting techniques now puts you ahead of 95% of users and unlocks capabilities most people don't even realize exist.

Which technique will you try first?

Again.,"So I just found out I won’t be part of the crew’s big ride next year. Again. They’re doing some 3-week ""loop"" ride across France and apparently I didn’t make the cut. No message, no vote. Just quietly left off the spreadsheet. 

Nice.

I’ll admit it: maybe I went a bit hard last time. Maybe I did treat it like a stage race. But isn’t the point of riding to push yourself? I trained for months, brought my own nutrition plan, a couple of soigneurs and maybe one ex-pro as a domestique.

But nooooo, suddenly that’s “too much.” Apparently wearing a full yellow kit every day and doing FTP intervals during coffee stops isn’t ""in the spirit"". Neither is handing out syringes of ""vitamin B12"" after the ride. Everyone got super judgey. I thought we were a team. What really pissed people off was that I kept ""hogging the front"" and ""making everything a race"".

 Sorry for putting in a little effort. Sorry for going full gas on climbs. Sorry for wanting to win. Even if it wasn’t officially timed, there was definitely a leaderboard vibe. I kept it on a spreadsheet. Just for fun. And yeah, I did win. All seven years. Weird how that made people uncomfortable.

Some guy (let’s call him ""Ramco"") kept bringing up my ""past behavior"" and said I ""shouldn’t even be allowed to ride anymore"". Like bro, I’ve already paid the price. Literally. I’ve lost things. Precious things. Parts of me that aren’t coming back. Not just time and reputation. Let’s just say I’m a bit lighter on the left side of the saddle.

They said my previous wins don’t count anymore. Whatever. They erased my name from the ride logs, said it’s like I was never even there. Really mature. Almost like they went back and stripped all the old KOMs too. I don’t see anyone else stepping up to claim them though.

Now they’re talking about this year’s event being ""clean, relaxed and about the journey, not the result"". Translation: boring. Good luck with your no-drop granola train. I’ll be out there solo, like I’ve always been. Still got the kit. Still got the legs. Still got a few tricks in the vein tank.

Anyway, if you see a guy blasting up the Alps alone next July, one ball down and seven yellow jerseys lighter, give me a nod.

Breaking it into parts for the ease of read only diminishes the depth of what we shared. Feel free to not read if its too long and if you search for TL;DR you won't find it here.*  
\-----------

Someday in mid winter, sipping his hot black coffee off the crystal glass at the cafe near the shore, he stares at the people stepping out the carrier ship. It's almost afternoon, he's been on this island, wandering aimless since the rainy season. While gulping almost all of it, he laid his eyes on a girl, who had nothing extraordinary to look at. Just some thick dense black curly hair, around 5'4"" tall, skin so tanned it looked almost like roasted almonds and a dressing sense that's quite confusing if she's about to step out of house or stay in the bed.

Slowly she made her way up to the cafe that's welcoming customers right from the deck of the ship, and ordered a black coffee as well. She sat at a table across his and opened her notebook where she scribbled a lot, of buildings, of poetry - nothing very specific, and a little of everything.

Along with the glass of coffee she also heard a line - *'they're so bad'*, confused she raised her head and saw a man pointing at her drawings.

*Oh? And do I care?*  
***-Well maybe you should, incase you want to exhibit them somewhere some day.***  
*Well I won't.*  
***-You should, and I'll buy all of them. I'm Nish*** \- he says smirking  
*I'm Nyla*, she replies confused and thinks to herself who in the world would just go from 0 to 180 to 360 that quick?  
***-Oh! Nish and Nyla went up a hill, the view so good they kissed so well***  
*That's the crassest thing one has ever said to me. What's your IQ? -1?*  
***-Well, I don't believe in number, they lie. What are you here for?***  
*Nothing much, to see the scenery and then die*, she chuckles.  
***-Me too, wanna do it together?*** He says grinning, while looking at the glass of coffee she took no sips from.

Nyla finishes her coffee in one go, pays the bill and sets out for the cafe, followed by Nish.

***-So tell me, what are you here for?***  
*I heard of the mountain that everyone treks here, I just wanna see what the view is like from there.*  
***-Oh, but I hate trekking.***  
*I didn't invite you to join me.*  
***-But Nish and Nyla are a thing now, like Laila-Majnu, Romeo-Juliet.***  
*They all die. And I don't want to die, not yet.*  
***-Okay, we'll not die, we'll just kiss and come back.***  
*Are you so jobless to just flirt with a random girl you just met? I mean, I am, hence I'm entertaining you.*  
***-That's enough then, I liked you, ever since I laid my eyes on you, which was 37 mins ago when you got down the ship.***  
*I'm tired of the journey and you too. I wanna sleep.*  
***-On the bed, with me?***  
*On the bed, without you. I'll go look for a place.*  
***-Crash at mine, I have an extra bed. The room is small, but I promise there are two beds***, he said almost convincingly.

Intrigued by his lack of shame and flirtatious behaviour, and also to save a little money, Nyla nodded yes to it and followed him to his place. The place is indeed small, but it offered an amazing view of the beach. There are two beds, side by side, separated by a coffee table in between, wooden flooring, off white walls with some beach quotes framed here and there.

The coffee table has two shelves within, and a lamp on top, and a book titled ***'One Hundred Years of Solitude'***. *You read?* Nyla asked while opening the door to balcony and tying back the curtains to not obstruct the view. ***I try to, I also like history. This book discusses the Latin American oppression. 30 pages in, I was in tears, you know?*** Nish replied while sitting on the bed and looking at her.

*Well, now I know. Why are you telling me everything?*  
***-Over sharing, you mean?***  
*Sort of.*  
***-As I said, Nish and Nyla are a thing. I'm your Nish and you're my Nyla***, he flirts again effortlessly, with the softest smirk on face.  
*Whatever that drug is, gimme some so I can be equally unfazed by your flowery words* she says as she turns back to enjoy the view.  
***-Well you can kiss me, that's one way or I'll kiss you***, he says while opening his arms.  
*I am sleepy, I will lie down for a while. I hope you are around by the time I wake up so I won't have to pay the whole bill of this room* Nyla says while getting under the duvet.  
***-Oh you only have to worried on getting rid of me, but not me disappearing on you,*** he says while flipping the pages of the book.  
Nish watches Nyla as she slips into sleep and wonders of the yellow flower rain from the book while flipping its pages. He thinks to himself of an interview in which he Garcia Marquez tells *nothing awful can happen to him if he is surrounded by yellow flowers and women* and wonders if Nyla could one of those, either a flower or a woman, and steps out of the room on to the road to get a breather.

It is almost 6 by the time Nyla woke up to find Nish nowhere. *Did he step out?* she thinks to herself. Freshens up and little and sets out to buy a raincoat and a cap required for the next days trek. As she walks down the street, she scans every face to see if it were Nish, none of them were. She walks a kilometer in the market road filled with a lot of lampshades and vibrant shops, and buys a translucent raincoat with beautiful yellow flowers and a cap that doesn't look nearly appealing, but fits her perfectly without having to adjust every minute.

On realizing she ate nothing the whole day, Nyla stops by a cafe, has some pastry and a coffee while scribbling on the notebook she  carried. She kept looking at the door every time someone entered thinking it might be Nish. After spending almost an hour in the cafe she retreats to the room hoping to see him there and reaches the stay by almost 9.

She enquires about Nish and the trek at the reception, the only answer she got was it is better to start early, and on the way up it could get chilly and also sunny. Upon hearing this, Nyla returns back to the room, lays on bed and wonders if Nish really disappeared and worried if she has to pay the whole bill. She also contemplates on whether to keep the door open or close it.

The next morning by 6 Nyla set on the trek and on her way, she paused at the reception to ask about the due amount that she has to pay, for which they reply the bill has already been settled. Confused, she steps out to find Nish swiftly walking back and forth.  
*Where have you been whole night?* Nyla yells.  
***-I was just caught up in something and couldn't make it back*** he says as if he is cornered.  
*You could have informed at least?* she raises her voice, worried.  
***-Next time I would***, he smiles and proceeds, ***so did you get a raincoat? and a cap? I hope they have flowers on them, preferably the yellow ones.***  
*Were you stalking me last night?* Nyla asks confused.  
***-No I just guessed, you seem like someone who likes flowers on every thing and also as someone who forgets a flashlight***, he smiles while showing off the flashlight in his hands.  
Nyla says nothing but stares at him and together they start in the direction of the trek.

It is almost 7 by the time they reach the starting point and both of them start feeling very cold because of the winter winds. It is not very bright per se, looks like they need to use the flashlight along the way given the dense bushes, incase something crawls on the ground.  
***-Do you want to have some coffee or something before we start?*** Nish asks while rubbing his belly. Nyla nods and they proceed to a small stall just beside where they sit outside while they wait for their coffee.  
*I'm 25, and an architect. I no longer like buildings though, I just want to go around the world and witness all wonders,* Nyla says looking at him, as if she wants him to give his details too.  
***-Is that why you draw so bad? Aren't architects supposed to be good at drawing?*** Nish jokes.  
*Well, now you met one who isn't. Wow! Nice! Right? But tell me about you,* Nyla asks.  
***-Hm, on good days I am 27, and on bad days I am 28. But I am sure for most of the days, I am yours***, Nish flirts while making an eye contact.  
*That wasn't what I was asking Nish. Who are you? Where were you last night? And how do you know of the raincoat?* Nyla asks gently.  
***-Well, I am everything and nothing. Maybe I am your soulmate.***  
*I don't believe in soulmates.*  
***-Me neither. But if there is one, its you to me.***  
Nyla stares. They get interrupted by the coffee that's served in small paper cups.  
*I should have brought my own glass,* Nyla sighs.  
***-So you can protect the planet? There are people flying to eat breakfast as we speak, we are too small to bring any change***, Nish laughs it off.  
*I know that, but I still want to do it for my own sake*, Nyla says annoyingly, carrying the frustration from the previous conversation.  
Till the moment they finished the coffee, neither of them spoke a word. As they stood to leave, Nish paid the bill and got a packet of biscuits and shows it to her signing its for the trek and keeps in in his bag. It is late winter now.

The path started jolly smooth in the beginning, it was almost a plain. But as the distance increased, so did the slope, making them both slow down.  
*What is your favourite colour?* Nyla asked.  
***-Blue, why? You plan on dating me? People usually start it by asking their favourite colour first*** Nish laughs.  
*Absolutely! But only if you get me a blue sapphire ring, it doesn't have to be too big, just blue*, Nyla says while showing her hand.  
***-Blue sapphire? Because I like blue?*** Nish says while panting and examining her hand closely. ***But in some parallel world, we must have already been married.***  
*And have a dozen kids?* Nyla breaks into a loud laugh.  
***-Right! And they all look beautiful, just like the wife, you. Should we try for more?*** Nish asks as if its a life and death question.  
*Well I wanna be child free TBH, they are so expensive. Can we not have kids? Can we just have coffee and each other?* Nyla asks pleasingly.  
***-Works. Whatever the woman wants***, Nish says extending his hand to hold hers.

A few more minutes into the trek, Nyla says, *I don't like treks, but having your company makes them less dislikable. Also what if I suddenly fall and die? Will you cry?*  
***-I'll die in the same instant Nyla***, Nish says with no change in the tone and with no reaction.  
*No Nish, you shouldn't, rather, you should take my ID card out from this bag and try reaching out to my family via police. My family would like you, you seem harmless, and when you handover my body, tear up a little so they don't think their daughter died while being loved*, Nyla said in a single breath, on top of her lungs, disappointed that Nish is as melodramatic as she is.  
***-But I don't want you to die. I want you to live happily. So shut up, please***, Nish sounds cold.  
Nyla proceed to walk in silence, behind him.

A little while later Nyla feels tired and calls out Nish to have the biscuits he earlier bought only to realize Nish was nowhere to be seen. She calls his name out loud and hears no response. *Did he fall somewhere and I didn't notice? Did he leave? Was he angry with my poor jokes? I am yet to know his favourite English word, and I am yet to tell that my favourite word is 'twinkle'. We are yet to reach the summit and savor the view. How can Nyla finish this trek without Nish? Didn't he say on and on about Nish and Nyla? Where is he now?* Nyla kept running a series of questions in her mind while looking out for Nish.

She pauses at a rock, tired from the steepness, she takes her bottle out to sip water and notices a book falling on the ground. It was the same book Nish had on the coffee table, the one that moved him to tears. On opening she found a yellow flower pressed inside, probably being used as a book mark. *When did he put this book in my bag? Nyla wonders. Is he really a human or a ghost that's haunting me? No he can't be the ghost, cause he paid the hotel bill. No I don't exactly know if he did. But we drank coffee together, he was alive, in flesh, he isn't a ghost. Magic is something I can try to gaslight myself into, but even that doesn't seem justifying. Who is he? No, where is he? Is he alright?* She stuffs back the bottle and the book into the bag and proceeds on to the top.

Thinking about Nish, worried where he went, Nyla proceeds to the top in hopes he must have reached already. She got too excited to look a the view, and not just the view, **but the view with Nish.** *Would he be waiting for me there?* It is almost late spring, by the time Nyla reached the top, the view was fantastic. The trek was boring without Nish, but the view upon reaching made her think of something else than Nish for a minute, she wondered if wonders ever cease to exist. How beautiful the ocean is! ***Nyla!***, she hears someone scream, out of joy. She turns her head to see, very well aware whose voice it is.

*How could you leave me like that?* Nyla yells.  
***-I am sorry, I thought you got comfortable with the slope and I carried on ahead, cause I know your small feel will eventually pace up and reach mine***, Nish says sorrily.  
*You can't leave as you please and come back flirting Nish, I was afraid I lost you, I was afraid I did something wrong*, Nyla says with almost tears in her eyes.  
***-Please don't cry, I am afraid you'll steal all my stars now that I made you cry. I should have acted better. I should have told you I was moving ahead. I am sorry lov.***  
*Even if I steal all stars, you will still have this brightest sun before you*, Nyla says wiping her tears pointing at herself.  
***-I lov you Nyla.***  
*Makes no sense, but I lov you too, I am sure.*  
***-What is lov? Why do you lov me? I disappeared a few times already, and didn't you notice how weird I was all along?*** Nish asks confusedly, but as if he isn't ready to hear the answer.  
*That's exactly why I lov you. I lov you for you. Why do you lov me?* Nyla questions.  
***-I wish there was a reason. With you there was never one, I lovd you since the beginning, with an absolute no reason*** Nish confesses as if he is repenting, ***I have nothing but lov for you and I know once this trek is over, we'll be over too, maybe that's why I am moving ahead of you, but I am also coming back cause I am worried you will slip and fall, then I will have to carry you all the way back.***  
*No, you can leave me and go*, Nyla says sadly, looking at Nish.  
***-No, I will not leave you anymore Nyla. We are Nish and Nyla, remember?***  
*Liar*, Nyla says tears swelling up her eyes, later adds, *let's take a picture, that way we'll remember each other for however long the picture stays. Almost forever.*  
***-I need no picture to remember you, you're imprinted very strongly in my memory***, Nish said dismissing Nyla's interest. Nyla remains calm and look hurt.  
***-Let's sit here for a while. Let us enjoy the view,*** Nish says while sitting on the ground and tapping a place beside him for Nyla to sit. Nyla sits down.  
They spend a lot of time in silence while Nyla hums some pop beats and Nish just looks at her adoringly.

A while later, Nish takes the flashlight out his bag and says, ***Nyla it might rain, you have the raincoat with you right? And it will also get very dark on the way back, I want you to have this so you won't lose your way back.***  
*But the summer just began Nish, it will be very bright. And are you disappearing again? I thought we would return together*, Nyla asks confusingly.  
***-We will, but I want you to have this flashlight with you. This is solar powered. It doesn't require you to change batteries. For however long you want light, it'll shine bright for you, just the way you are shining now***, Nish says monotonously.  
*Okay, so this is it right? Okay. I will take this flashlight and in return, I will give you back your stars. That way we both have brightness in the middle of the darkness,* Nyla says while smiling at him.  
***-Oh the Sun is giving back the stars! The pleasure is mine***, Nish laughs.  
*Haha yes!* Nyla says while keeping the flashlight in her bag and suddenly remembers about his book and takes it out to return it to him, only to find him gone.

Hey, fellow MaximizeMe fam! 🌟

Ever find yourself scrolling through the endless parade of “life hacks” and “new habits” people swear by? I mean, one day it’s all about drinking a gallon of water, and the next, it’s waking up at 5 a.m. to meditate while doing yoga on one leg. 😅 I get it — it can feel overwhelming!

But here’s a thought: **what if there’s just ONE simple thing you can do every day that actually makes a difference?** 

So, let’s dive into my go-to habit that finally stuck: **the power of a daily gratitude journal**. Sounds basic, right? But hear me out!

### Here’s why it works for me:

- **Shift in mindset**: Instead of focusing on what’s going wrong, I’m forcing myself to notice the good stuff. It’s like putting on a pair of gratitude glasses! Seriously, some days it's just as simple as “I had coffee today” or “My cat did something goofy.” 

- **Consistency is key**: I’ve set a reminder on my phone. Every night before bed, I jot down three things I’m grateful for. It takes me five minutes, and it’s become a cozy little ritual that wraps up my day.

- **Mood booster**: It’s amazing how reflecting on the positive helps me sleep better. Sometimes, I’ll fall asleep smiling, which is way better than stressing about that awkward email I sent earlier. 😬

### And you know what’s even cooler? 

- **It’s totally customizable!** Want to doodle instead of write? Go for it! Feeling poetic? Write a little haiku about your day! There are no rules — just do what feels good.

- **You can share!** I started sharing my daily gratitude lists with a friend, and it’s turned into this fun little exchange. Suddenly, we’re both looking for the good stuff in our lives to share, and it’s become a laugh-fest! 

Now I’m curious: **what’s your one daily habit that has changed your life?** Do you have a quirky routine, or maybe something more traditional? Let’s swap ideas and see what sticks — you never know what gem someone else might share! 

So, tell me, what’s working for you? Let’s keep this vibe going! 🎉",1,1744701035.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

People always talk about gut health. But no one ever told me my mouth needed a healthy microbiome too.

That discovery changed my entire understanding of oral care—and led me straight to **ProDentim**.

# 🧠 The Mouth-Body Connection

Did you know that poor oral health is linked to:

* Cardiovascular disease
* Brain fog and cognitive decline
* Poor immune response
* Inflammation throughout the body

I had no idea either.

But when I read that the same inflammation that causes gum disease also affects your heart and brain, I knew I had to take action.

That’s when I found ProDentim—and it was the **missing puzzle piece** in my wellness journey.

# 🧬 What Makes ProDentim So Powerful?

Each chewable tablet delivers a blend of:

* **3.5 billion CFUs of oral probiotics**
* **Inulin and chicory root for prebiotic support**
* **BLIS strains for respiratory and immune support**
* **Natural ingredients for gum and tooth strength**

It’s not just for your mouth—it supports your **entire system**, starting at the source.

# 💎 My Experience After 30 Days of ProDentim

* My teeth are no longer sensitive to cold.
* My breath stays fresh, even after coffee.
* My gums are pink, tight, and healthy.
* My digestion even improved (an unexpected bonus!)
* I feel *cleaner* from the inside out.

No more scraping, flossing till I bleed, or spending hundreds at the dentist.

One simple chewable a day—and I’m covered.

# 💬 Final Thoughts: Stop Treating Symptoms—Start Restoring Balance

If you want to finally end the cycle of mouth problems, bad breath, and expensive dental visits—**start with ProDentim**.

It’s backed by real science, trusted by thousands, and has worked miracles for people like me who thought they had tried *everything*.

The truth is, oral health is *internal*—and this is the only product I’ve found that actually supports it from the inside out.

I used to wake up every morning feeling like I hadn’t slept at all. My body ached, my brain was foggy, and even the simplest tasks felt like climbing a mountain. I tried everything—coffee, energy drinks, vitamins, meditation—but nothing made a real difference.

That all changed the day I discovered **MITOLYN**.

I didn’t expect much. After all, I’d tried so many so-called “energy boosters” that over-promised and under-delivered. But within the first week of taking MITOLYN, something amazing happened…

I woke up clear-headed. My muscles felt *awake*. I wasn’t dragging myself through the day—I was **driving** it.

So, what is MITOLYN?

It’s not your average supplement. **MITOLYN is a cutting-edge mitochondrial support formula** that revives your body at the cellular level. While other supplements slap a temporary band-aid on fatigue, MITOLYN goes deeper—restoring the engine of your body: the mitochondria.

# ⚡ The Science Behind the Magic

MITOLYN combines the most advanced ingredients proven to recharge cellular energy production, including:

* **CoQ10** – Powers your cells’ energy factories
* **PQQ** – Stimulates new mitochondrial growth
* **L-Carnitine** – Transports fatty acids into mitochondria for fuel
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – Fights oxidative stress and inflammation
* **Magnesium & B vitamins** – Essential co-factors for energy metabolism

This isn’t guesswork. These are clinically backed ingredients, in their most bioavailable forms, working in harmony to restore vitality *where it starts*—in your cells.

# 🔥 What Changed After MITOLYN?

* I no longer rely on caffeine.
* My mind is sharp and alert all day.
* My workouts feel powerful again.
* I’m not just surviving—I’m thriving.
* Even my mood improved—I feel *alive.*

This isn’t hype. This is **transformation**. MITOLYN didn’t just give me energy—it gave me *myself* back.

And here’s the best part: **No crash, no jitters, no side effects**. Just real, sustainable energy and focus that builds with every dose.

If you’re tired of being tired… if you feel like you’ve lost your spark… **MITOLYN is your answer**. It changed my life. It will change yours too.",1,1744701008.0,aliner,3,1.0,False

I’ve always been tired.

Not just the “I stayed up too late” tired—but a deep, dragging fatigue that made it hard to get out of bed, focus at work, or enjoy time with my kids. Doctors said I was fine. My blood work was normal. But I knew something was *off*.

I tried supplements, B12 injections, caffeine detoxes. Nothing worked.

Then I read something online: “**Dehydration isn’t just about drinking water—it’s about absorbing it.**” That hit me like a brick. I was drinking water, but maybe… I wasn’t actually absorbing anything from it.

Enter: **Aqua Tower.**

# 🚀 Life-Changing Energy

In just three days of drinking Aqua Tower-filtered water, I felt **brighter**. My mind was clearer. I stopped reaching for coffee at 2PM. And I finally understood what people meant by “natural energy.”

Why? Because Aqua Tower doesn't just purify—it *revitalizes*.

Its multi-stage filtration removes toxins and re-mineralizes the water with magnesium and calcium, improving cellular absorption and hydration.

Suddenly I wasn’t just quenching thirst—I was *fueling* my body.

# More Benefits I Didn’t Expect:

✅ **Better digestion.** My bloating vanished.  
✅ **Weight loss.** No joke—5 pounds melted away in a few weeks.  
✅ **Sharper focus.** I finally crushed that work presentation without brain fog.  
✅ **Deeper sleep.** My REM cycles returned—and I woke up rested.  
✅ **Improved mood.** I felt *light*, optimistic, and happy.

And I didn’t change anything else. Just my water.

I can’t believe how overlooked hydration is. We spend money on skincare, supplements, gym memberships—but if your water isn’t working *with* your body, it’s holding you back.

# Aqua Tower Is the Upgrade Your Body Deserves

It’s not just a filter. It’s a health tool. A daily upgrade. A silent partner that supports your body 24/7. I recommend it to everyone now—coworkers, family, even my chiropractor.

And here’s the kicker: **It paid for itself in 2 months**. No more bottled water. No more fatigue drinks. No more guessing games. Just clean, energized living.

If you’ve been feeling off, tired, or sluggish—don’t write it off as “just life.” Change your water. Change your body. Change *everything*.

I used to think all water was the same. If it came out of the tap and looked clear, I assumed it was safe. That is—until my daughter developed chronic skin issues, and our dishes started coming out cloudy no matter how much we scrubbed.

I was doing everything right—buying organic, cooking healthy, keeping our home spotless. But something wasn’t clicking. That’s when I stumbled upon a water test kit and decided to test our tap water out of curiosity. What I discovered horrified me.

Our water was full of **chlorine**, **heavy metals**, and **sediment**. I felt *betrayed*. And suddenly, it made sense—my daughter’s rashes, my brittle hair, even the weird metallic taste in our coffee.

I started researching water purification options and kept seeing one name over and over: **Aqua Tower**.

It looked sleek. The reviews were glowing. But I wanted more than a fancy filter—I needed *transformation*. And let me tell you… **Aqua Tower delivered that and more.**

# 💧 The First Day With Aqua Tower

The moment I turned it on, I could taste the difference. The water was *crisp*, *clean*, and *pure*—not just ""better"" than tap water. It tasted like spring water you'd find bottled for $4 a liter.

Even better?

* My daughter’s skin improved within a week.
* My coffee? Heavenly.
* My dishes came out crystal clear.
* And showers felt *softer*, leaving no residue or dryness.

Aqua Tower is more than a filter. It’s a full-spectrum water purification **powerhouse**. It removes chlorine, fluoride, heavy metals, bacteria, and microplastics—while preserving essential minerals your body *needs*. You’re not just drinking clean water. You’re drinking *smart* water.

# 🌍 Why I’ll Never Go Back

Aqua Tower changed my *entire* perspective on health. It’s not about avoiding bad food—it’s about what goes into your body *every single day*. And water is the foundation of everything.

Now I know: Clean water affects **your skin, your gut, your mood, your sleep**—even your immune system.

With Aqua Tower, I sleep better. My family is healthier. And I have peace of mind knowing I’m protecting them from invisible toxins.

When I first heard about **ProstaVive**, I rolled my eyes. Another supplement claiming to fix the problems that specialists, medications, and endless doctor visits hadn’t been able to? Yeah right.

But I was desperate. The medications I was prescribed helped a little, but the side effects were brutal—dizziness, headaches, and even lower libido. I felt like I was trading one problem for another.

So I took a chance. I ordered ProstaVive. And to be honest, I expected nothing. But what happened next surprised me.

# Week 1:

My night trips dropped from 5+ to just 2. I was shocked. I thought it might be a fluke.

# Week 2:

I slept all the way through until morning—for the first time in *years*.

# Week 3:

The daytime urgency decreased. I wasn’t constantly checking for the nearest bathroom, and I could actually enjoy a cup of coffee without panicking 30 minutes later.

# By One Month:

My life had changed. My energy returned. I felt younger. I was more confident. And let’s just say... things improved in the *romance* department too.

# What Makes ProstaVive Different?

It’s the synergy of ingredients. It doesn’t just target symptoms—it supports the *entire* male health system. The saw palmetto shrinks the prostate. Beta-sitosterol improves flow. Zinc and selenium reduce inflammation. It’s everything your prostate *wants*, in one powerful formula.

So if you’re tired of discomfort, frustration, and the endless cycle of meds and waiting rooms—**ProstaVive is your answer**. I’m living proof.",1,1744700998.0,aliner,2,1.0,False

If you’re anything like me, you've probably spent years jumping from one supplement to another, hoping *something* would finally work. Whether it was bloating, brain fog, low energy, or skin issues, I was always looking for the ""magic fix."" But nothing truly worked—until I found **PrimeBiome**.

Let me start by saying: I was skeptical. Every product promises miracles, right? But **PrimeBiome** isn’t just another flashy supplement—it’s *science-backed*, clean, and genuinely effective. Within the first week of taking it, I felt different. And not just in a “maybe it’s working?” kind of way. I’m talking *tangible* differences.

✅ **No more bloating after meals.**  
✅ **Energy that lasts all day without coffee.**  
✅ **A calm, focused mind.**  
✅ **Better digestion. Every. Single. Day.**

I’ve always believed gut health is the key to everything, but I didn’t realize how broken my gut was until I fixed it. PrimeBiome helped me *reset* my body from the inside out. After years of gut discomfort, mood swings, and sluggish mornings, I finally feel like *me* again.

**What makes PrimeBiome different?**  
It’s the potent blend of probiotics, prebiotics, and digestive enzymes that actually work in synergy. This isn’t just some probiotic tossed together in a factory—it's formulated with strains that survive stomach acid and reach your gut *alive*. That’s a huge deal. Most probiotics don’t even make it past your stomach!

And here's the crazy part: My skin started to glow. I wasn’t even expecting that benefit, but my complexion cleared up, my eyes looked brighter, and I felt confident without makeup. I even lost a few pounds effortlessly—no intense dieting, just my body working like it *should*.

I used to live with constant cravings and emotional eating. PrimeBiome calmed that completely. My cravings are gone, my mood is stable, and I no longer feel like a slave to sugar and carbs.

If you’re dealing with:

* Digestive issues
* Constant fatigue
* Brain fog
* Unexplained skin problems
* Mood swings
* Weight that won’t budge

...then please, do yourself a favor and try **PrimeBiome**. I tell everyone about it now—family, friends, even strangers. It’s *that* good. It’s not just a supplement—it’s a total wellness upgrade. The best part? It’s gentle, vegan, non-GMO, and free from the junk that clogs up most other supplements.

I don’t usually write reviews. But when something changes your life, you can’t *not* talk about it. Trust me—this is the gut reset your body’s been begging for. Don’t wait.",1,1744700981.0,aliner,2,1.0,False

You ever read a character and think, *damn, that’s me*—and then read another and go, *no wait, that’s who I want to be*?

That’s what this debate feels like.  
Rachel Chu is the girl-next-door turned Cinderella in couture.  
Ha Li is the girl you never saw coming—until she owns the whole damn scene.

Let’s break this down. Character by character. Thread by thread.

# 🎓 Academic Baddies

**Rachel Chu**: [**https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3104988/**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3104988/)  
NYU professor, economics brainiac, book-smart with a closet full of Banana Republic and dreams of happy endings. She’s never had wealth, but she holds her own in boardrooms and Mahjong showdowns. Her “smarts” are academic. Her power is *earned* through integrity.

**Ha Li**: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F4KGDLV7](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F4KGDLV7)  
Stanford Law. Five coffees a day. Wields contracts like scalpels. She doesn’t teach economics—she *plays* the economy. Her intelligence isn’t just technical, it’s strategic. She negotiates leases, fixes generational fractures, and *saves a failing legacy company* while grieving the loss of her father.

**Winner**:  
Rachel passes the test.  
Ha *writes* the bar exam and changes the grading curve.

# 💰 Wealth & Power

**Rachel**:  
Thrust into old money, completely unprepared. She fights for her dignity while being ambushed at galas and judged in Mandarin.

**Ha**:  
Born adjacent to power, but never let into the inner circle—until she *forces* her way in. She doesn’t inherit wealth, she *reclaims* it, not by marrying into it, but by *running* it. Her identity isn't tied to status. It’s about *impact.*

**Also:** Rachel gets a ring. Ha gets *her mother-in-law’s ring AND the company.*

# 🫶 Romance Vibes

**Rachel & Nick**:  
Sweet. Clean. The kind of relationship where you talk things out and meet at the airport. Nick is a good man, but he’s emotionally… ornamental. The conflict isn’t between them—it’s around them. Their love survives *despite* external chaos.

**Ha & Lee**:  
Trauma-bonded since childhood. Literally saved each other’s lives. Then grew apart. Then *found each other again as adults*—through grief, pain, and half-drunk karaoke. This isn’t a fairy tale. It’s *earned love.* It’s someone looking at you across the city and saying:

>

Also: Ha proposes *with her whole presence* before Lee even finds the ring.

**Verdict**:  
Rachel's love is sweet.  
Ha’s love *wrecks you and stitches you back together.*

# 💥 Confrontation Energy

**Rachel**:  
Confronts Eleanor at Mahjong, uses grace and restraint as a weapon. She walks away *knowing her worth.*

**Ha**:  
Doesn't need a public scene. She confronts pain *in the quiet.* In the kitchen. On a hospital floor. In the softest whisper when Lee is breaking. And when the moment comes? She *doesn't run.* She *stays*.

Rachel drops the tile.  
Ha just looks at you and says,

>

And you cry *anyway.*

# 🕯️ Healing Arc

**Rachel**:  
Finds out her dad is alive. Explores identity. Navigates belonging between two cultures.

**Ha**:  
Finds out she’s broken. Accepts it. Rebuilds. Helps *others* rebuild. She holds her grief and someone else’s at the same time. She doesn’t get healed by love. She *chooses* to be loved while still in process.

>

That line alone clears 90% of protagonists.

# 👠 Soft Power Queens

* Rachel earns respect by walking away.
* Ha earns loyalty by *showing up.*
* Rachel gets a mother-in-law's nod of approval.
* Ha gets an entire *legacy* handed down across generations, with both families bowing to *her* as the new matriarch in training.

# TL;DR

* Rachel is the dream you root for.
* Ha is the woman you become *after you’ve been broken, loved again, and chose yourself every time.*

Rachel holds her head high.  
Ha looks you in the eye and says,

>

And she means it.

Ha Li clears.

No hate to Rachel—she walked so Ha could *build the entire infrastructure.*  
But if I’m in the trenches of life, grief, power, and love?

## What is BTC Bumex 9000?

BTC Bumex 9000 is an **automated crypto trading platform** that uses advanced algorithms to analyze market trends and execute trades on your behalf. Think of it like a robot stockbroker that never sleeps and doesn’t charge commissions.

The platform claims to use **AI-powered trading signals**, giving users an edge by reacting to market changes in real-time. Whether you're looking to trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, forex pairs, or commodities like gold — it’s got you covered.

It’s designed to be **user-friendly** and doesn’t require you to be a Wall Street genius to use it. You don’t need to know what a candlestick chart is to get started, which makes it super appealing to beginners.

## Who Created BTC Bumex 9000?

Here’s where things get a little vague. Like most auto-trading platforms, the creators behind BTC Bumex 9000 aren’t exactly front and center doing TED Talks. It’s pretty common in this space — platforms like **Bitcoin Era** and **Immediate Edge** also have anonymous developers or teams.

That being said, from everything I’ve seen and tested, the platform seems to be **professionally built**, with an interface that rivals some of the more established players. There are hints that it was developed by a group of professional traders and software engineers, but again, no official LinkedIn profiles to stalk. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

### [🔥 Start Trading with BTC Bumex 9000 Today](https://tinyurl.com/2hxkrejm)
## How Does BTC Bumex 9000 Work?

BTC Bumex 9000 works by combining **AI algorithms, trading bots, and real-time market data** to make trades on your behalf. The idea is simple: it scans the market, spots patterns (like a nerdy Sherlock Holmes), and then automatically places trades when it sees potential profits.

You can set up trading parameters — like how much to invest, stop-loss limits, and risk levels — or just let the default settings do their thing. There’s also a **demo mode**, which is great if you want to practice without risking real money.

Here’s what happens behind the scenes:

- The AI scans multiple markets for signals.
- When it detects a profitable opportunity, it places a trade.
- It tries to “buy low, sell high” in milliseconds.
- Profits (if any) are added to your account balance.

It’s fast, hands-off, and can run 24/7 — even while you’re binge-watching Netflix.

## BTC Bumex 9000 Pros and Cons

Here’s the real talk. No platform is perfect, and BTC Bumex 9000 isn’t immune. But it does have more going for it than against it.

**Pros:**

- ✅ **Beginner-Friendly Interface**

It’s been an intense 17-hour day (and counting!), but as the CEO of DrinQUP, I’m beyond excited to share today’s massive updates with you all. We’re on a mission to revolutionize queue management across industries, starting with nightlife, and I can’t wait to tell you what’s been happening behind the scenes.

# CoinMarketCap Listing Application

We’ve taken a big step toward global visibility for QUP Coin by applying for a full CoinMarketCap listing, moving beyond our Dexscan presence. As part of the verification process, here are the details:

* **Ticket Number**: #1100486
* **Dexscan URL**: [https://coinmarketcap.com/dexscan/solana/GpoAMCyi4RgKeDVVbK8Sbxd5B6ehnftxr16xptAv6PTP/](https://coinmarketcap.com/dexscan/solana/GpoAMCyi4RgKeDVVbK8Sbxd5B6ehnftxr16xptAv6PTP/) Follow us on Twitter/X [u/DrinQUP](https://x.com/QupCorp) for more updates as we push this forward!

# Core DrinQUP API & MVP Beta

I met with my CTO today to finalize the Core DrinQUP API, and we’ve locked in the initial MVP beta functionality. We will be thrilled to share the fundamentals of QUP (Queue Up) that we’ll start with. After initial testing and validation of queue control, we’ll gradually crank up the functionality, unleashing the true value of real virtual queue management. As many of you know we already have a provisional patent for our queuing system, and an approved Trademark on the QUP logo and are just waiting on USPTO lawyers.

Just like “Google” became a verb, we believe “QUP” will too. It’s a game-changer that can transform any industry with minor tweaks. Our flagship product, DrinQUP (pronounced “Drink Up”), is just the beginning—a beta app is coming this summer! But we’re not stopping at bars. We’ve built a platform (and by platform, I actually mean platform and not just the word that every business owner likes to use) that’s easy for any business owner to adopt, with an API for seamless integration and white-label options for events like food trucks, weddings, festivals—you name it. Think there’s an obstacle? Trust me, we’ve already solved it.

# QUP Coin: A Simple Rewards System That Grows in Value

For those who aren’t familiar with cryptocurrency or feel a bit nervous about it—don’t worry, I get it! I know the crypto world can seem confusing or even risky, especially with all the scams and wild price swings you might have heard about. But let me assure you, QUP Coin is different, and I’ll break it down in a way that’s easy to understand.

Think of QUP Coin like a digital version of a loyalty points program—similar to what you’d get at your favorite coffee shop, but with a twist that makes it even better. At first, when you use DrinQUP to skip the line at a bar (or any business), you’ll get your rewards in regular cash—good old dollars, just like you’re used to. But soon, we’ll give you the **option** to receive those rewards as QUP Coins instead.

Why would you want that? Here’s the exciting part: QUP Coin is designed to grow in value as more people use our system worldwide. It’s not like those risky cryptocurrencies that go up and down like a rollercoaster once we get it past it's baby stages and integrated into our application. We’ve tied its value to real transactions in our ecosystem, so it’s more stable and based on actual use. The more people “QUP” to skip lines, the more valuable your QUP Coins become. It’s like getting a gift card that’s worth more over time!

You can use QUP Coins within our app for cool perks—like getting even faster service or exclusive offers at bars and events. If you’d prefer to turn your QUP Coins into cash or other things like stocks, you can transfer them out of our app to your own digital wallet. From there, you can use a separate cryptocurrency exchange or platform to convert them into regular money or other assets—it’s your choice! Just to be clear, we’re not a crypto exchange ourselves, and we don’t handle those conversions directly. Our app makes it easy to move your QUP Coins out, and the process is as straightforward as transferring money with a banking app—no tech expertise needed.

# 

Here’s what makes it truly special: by using QUP, you’re not just a customer—you’re a stakeholder. The more people join in and use the system, the more your rewards are worth. It’s like being part of a shared success story where everyone benefits—users like you, the businesses you visit, and even the servers who get extra bonuses on top of their tips. We’re creating a fair, transparent way to make waiting in line better for everyone, and DrinQUP/QUP/QUP  Coin is the key to making that happen on a global scale.

# 

# Purple Coins for TCU Students

On a lighter note, I also spent some time troubleshooting my 3D printer with the new AMS (automatic material system). After some trial and error, I’m now printing purple QUP Coins for the students at TCU—a small token of appreciation for their support and to give our new TCU sales VP's something to talk about at parties. (Shoutout to TCU for their awesome colors— 🟣 ⚪)

# A Steamroller in Motion



It’s late, and I’m still not done with my day, but I couldn’t wait to share these milestones with the community. Let me know what you think, and as always, #justsaywhen!

1jzl7tw,https://www.reddit.com/r/cat_preparation/comments/1jzl7tw/the_big_3_bschools_of_india_the_ultimate_mba/,The Big 3 B-Schools of India – The Ultimate MBA Showdown,"So, you’ve started dreaming about your MBA journey. And let’s be honest — for most of us, it kicks off with *“I want to crack IIM A, B, or C!”* These three are like the Avengers of Indian B-schools — iconic, powerful, and always fighting for the top spot.

But here comes the big question: *Which one’s the best?*  
Well, the rankings usually put IIM Ahmedabad on the throne... but plot twist — a bunch of folks *voluntarily* ditch A to join Bangalore or Calcutta. Why? Let’s dive into the numbers and vibes of these legendary campuses and figure out what’s what.

# 🏛 Founded In:

* **IIM Ahmedabad** – 1961 (OG Alert!)
* **IIM Bangalore** – 1973 (The youngest sibling, but growing strong)
* **IIM Calcutta** – 1961 (Twin of A, but with a Bay of Bengal view)

# 🎓 Batch Strength (2023)

* **A** – 389
* **B** – 530
* **C** – 465

Bangalore clearly threw the biggest party this year with the highest batch size. More the merrier, right?

# 💸 Average Package

* **A** – ₹34.45 LPA
* **B** – ₹35.31 LPA
* **C** – ₹35.07 LPA

Bangalore out here proving that size *doesn't* matter — even with the biggest batch, they snagged the highest average. Smooth.

# 📊 Median Package

* **A** – ₹31.58 LPA
* **B** – ₹33 LPA
* **C** – ₹33.67 LPA

Well, well, well… Calcutta casually flexing that 50% of their batch got more than ₹33.67 LPA. Respect!

# 🕵️‍♂️ Consulting Offers

* **A** – 45%
* **B** – 40%
* **C** – 41%

Consulting’s the crowd-favorite — and all three B-schools are handing out these offers like free Wi-Fi. The ratio’s pretty balanced though, so no clear winner here.

# 💰 Finance Offers

* **A** – 21%
* **B** – 9%
* **C** – 15%

Ahmedabad and Calcutta are giving each other the side-eye here. Bangalore… well, maybe they were off sipping filter coffee when the finance companies showed up.

# 📢 Sales & Marketing Offers

* **A** – 6%
* **B** – 11%
* **C** – 9%

Bangalore’s got some serious S&M (Sales & Marketing, people! Keep it clean.) mojo going on here.

# 🧠 Product Management Offers

* **A** – 13%
* **B** – 14%
* **C** – 18%

Product Management is on the rise, and Calcutta’s clearly riding that wave. PM aspirants, take note.

# 🧾 TL;DR

Honestly, it’s a close call across the board. The packages? All solid. The domains? Pretty balanced with some spicy differences.

But here’s the real deal: if you *do* crack all three — *A, B, and C* — what’s going to tip the scale for you?  
Will it be the vibe of the city? The weather? The food? (Yes, we’re looking at you, Calcutta biryani vs. Bangalore idli vs. Amdavadi khakra.)  
Or something else entirely?

**What is “Bobby Rio - 7 Sexual Game Changers” All About?**  
So let’s get straight to it — *Bobby Rio - 7 Sexual Game Changers* is a no-fluff mini course that’s all about leveling up your game when it comes to attraction and intimacy. Bobby Rio, known for his super-practical advice on dating and relationships, breaks down seven specific techniques that are designed to create sexual tension, deepen connection, and bring a serious upgrade to your interactions with women. Think of it like a cheat code for sparking chemistry and making your presence unforgettable.

**Who Is This For? (Hint: If You’ve Ever Felt “Stuck” with Women)**  
If you’ve ever had a great convo with a girl but then things fizzled out… or if you’re always hearing “you’re such a nice guy” and nothing more — this course was basically made for you. Whether you're new to dating or just want to get out of the dreaded friend zone, *Bobby Rio - 7 Sexual Game Changers* gives you tools to stop playing it safe and start creating real attraction. It’s for guys who want to be bold, playful, and… yeah, a little dangerous (in the good way).

**When Should You Use These Game Changers? (Spoiler: ASAP)**  
You can start using these techniques the *moment* you learn them. That’s what makes this course different. No waiting, no prep — just small, powerful tweaks to your current vibe that trigger a stronger, more magnetic connection.

**Where Do These Techniques Work Best?**  
The beauty of *Bobby Rio - 7 Sexual Game Changers* is that they’re super versatile. They work in-person, over the phone, even on social media.

So whether you’re at the bar, grabbing coffee, or chilling on the couch, you can use them to instantly spike sexual chemistry.

**Why Are These Game Changers Actually Effective?**  
Here’s the thing: attraction isn’t always logical — it’s emotional. Bobby Rio taps into that truth with these tools. Each one is designed to bypass the surface-level chit-chat and go straight to the gut-level spark that builds desire. For example:

* **Rapport Buster** breaks the “nice guy” routine and adds mystery.

**How Do You Actually Use These Tips?**

Sometimes, I scroll through reels longer than I should—not out of boredom, but because my feed is filled with the kind of softness I crave. Cats sleeping on windowsills. Couples being goofy and kind. Strangers doing nice things without a reason. It’s not just content—it’s the reminder that love like that exists. That people like me still make sense.

I’m 18. I’m someone who gives love like a storm—intense, consuming, loyal, and unapologetically tender. If I’m in, I’m all in. I’ll flirt with you like I’ve studied your smile for years. I’ll check in on how your soul’s doing, not just your day. I’ll remember the small things, even when you forget them yourself. I love deeply, and I love deliberately.

I’m not here for casual. I’m not here for games. I’m here because I still believe that two people can build something real—something that’s messy, slow-burning, wildly romantic, and a little exhausting in all the best ways.

When I’m not working toward my dream of becoming a robotics scientist, I’m usually learning something new, vibing to songs (Linkin Park or Radiohead when the emotions hit), or cooking—because food and love have one thing in common: effort.

I love people who are kind for no reason. I get attached to souls more than bodies. I don’t care about your looks. I care about your character. About whether you'd help a lost dog or remember your friend’s weird coffee order. I'm agnostic, but I respect people who have faith—any faith—as long as they respect others too.

I’m not perfect. I feel a lot. I think too much. I love in ways that scare me sometimes. But if you’re someone who’s been waiting to be truly seen, truly chosen, truly held—not just physically, but emotionally and spiritually—I might just be your kind of person.
Say hi—sure. But say more than that.
If I poured a piece of my soul into this, I hope you can spare a little of yours too.
Tell me what part of this resonated. Or tell me who you are. Tell me what makes you feel like you still deserve love that doesn’t flinch. I’ll be reading every word.

And if you’ve made it this far—maybe you’re the kind of person who sees love the way I do.
Not something to fall into, but something to build. Not just sparks, but steady warmth.

So don’t just message me. Match me. Match this effort.

Show me you're not just passing by—show me you were meant to find this.

After that she continued to ask me out for a while, I was a little apprehensive but never asked since she was a junior in my college and had a boyfriend so I assumed she just needed a friend. After that we suddenly started talking a lot and hanging out a lot (like a lot) I hung out with her more than my own friends because of how close we felt to each other. We were close and we used to take time out for each other, almost like dating. We even went for nights out. Now I have completed my college and I never got to ask her what we are? And now I don't think I can ask her. I am not sure what to do. Can someone tell me what is going on and how should I deal with this. And when we used to hangout she used to say that she has broken up and is single and now since I amno longer there she is in a relationship. So is this a friendship, a fling. What is this?

Is it caused by depression?,"Hello, I have been hanging out with a boy who is super sweet when we are together. We are not dating but when we meet for a walk or for a coffee, he always hugs me and kisses me (on my forehead or on the lips). I really like him so I was convinced this was a sign that he liked me too. However, in 5 months there was no change in this relationship. I asked him directly what was his opinion about our relationship (I don't usually kiss my friends!). He said he's not sure and has to think about it. Since then he has been distant and doesn't communicate too much.

Also, he has some mental problems which I really tried to learn about to understand him. Could his behavior be caused by depression? I'm afraid I pushed too hard and that's why he's distant now. Three month ago, before his depression worsened, he said he wanted me to be in his life, but now he's so cold and passive. He said he just wants to stay home and doesn't want to talk to anyone.

But I've also found myself growing into other things I found boring or outright awful before.  
  
In my 20's, a weekend wasn't complete if I wasn't kitted out in a brand new suit, in the VIP area of an exclusive nightclub. Now, the idea of that sends chills down my spine, and I'd much prefer to spend a weekend camping with family, watching the sunrise over a misty field with a cup of coffee. A holiday was about party, party, party till 5am, but now I fantasise sitting in a taverna on an isolated white stone beach, crystal clear water and a beautiful sunshine washing over my skin.  
  
Fragrances though—I thought maybe I would grow into them too. Perhaps I could come to appreciate the more refined notes, the scents assoscoated with older gentlemen would be more appealing, I'd move past buying for what a girl in the club would find sexy and instead appreciate well made classical perfumes.

Maybe I'm falling out of love with fragrance, everything now is just a flanker of a commercially successful fragrance. Perfume houses now seem to have the same business model as Disney and Netflix - just keep remaking the same tired money makers ad nauseum.

Ever felt like you're missing out on the crypto trading boom because everything just seems *too complicated*? Yeah, same here.

In this review, I’m digging into what makes AlgosOne tick. I’ll break down its features, how it works, what I liked, what could be better, and most importantly—whether it’s worth your time.

## What is AlgosOne?

AlgosOne is an **automated trading platform** that uses algorithmic technology to help users trade cryptocurrencies, forex, and other assets. Think of it as a smart assistant that watches the markets 24/7 and makes winning trades on your behalf (or at least tries to).

The idea is to make trading **less emotional and more data-driven**. It’s especially attractive to people like me who don’t have the time or patience to sit in front of a screen all day watching candlestick charts. You can set your parameters, let the system do its thing, and check in when it’s convenient.

This isn’t totally unique—others like Bitcoin Era do similar things—but what caught my attention with AlgosOne is how **user-friendly** it is and how it seems designed with regular folks in mind.

## Who Created AlgosOne?

This is where things get a bit mysterious. There’s no single high-profile name tied to AlgosOne, which is common for platforms like this. But based on the design, support system, and how well it performs, it’s clear the team behind it knows what they’re doing.

From what I could dig up, it looks like a **team of experienced developers, traders, and fintech experts** collaborated to build a platform that bridges the gap between professional trading tools and beginner accessibility.

Some might see this lack of public leadership as a red flag, but honestly, it’s not unusual in the world of crypto trading platforms. As long as the platform works and does what it promises, I’m okay with a bit of anonymity.

### [🔥 Start Trading with AlgosOne Today](https://tinyurl.com/mtdtz4rn)
## How Does AlgosOne Work?

AlgosOne uses **algorithmic trading** powered by **machine learning and real-time market data**. Once you set your trading goals and risk tolerance, the platform takes over and begins scanning markets for trading opportunities.

Here’s the basic flow:

- You create and fund an account.
- The algorithms analyze market trends and execute trades based on your preferences.
- You can monitor performance, adjust settings, or go completely hands-free.

The platform claims to have a **high win rate**, which I couldn’t verify with hard numbers, but my experience and some user testimonials suggest it performs well—especially in volatile markets. It's cool that you can **manually override trades** if you want more control, so it’s not entirely on autopilot unless you want it to be.

## AlgosOne Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real for a second—no platform is perfect. Here's what stood out to me:

### ✅ Pros

- **Beginner-friendly interface** (super clean and easy to navigate)
- **Automated trading** saves tons of time
- **Supports multiple asset classes** (not just crypto)
- **Real-time market data** is pretty accurate
- **Custom alerts** and manual control options
- **Demo account** to practice without risking real money
- **Responsive customer support**

### ❌ Cons

- **No mobile app** (just a mobile-optimized site)
- **$250 minimum deposit** might be steep for some
- **Limited transparency** about the team
- **No guarantee of profits** (but that’s true for any trading platform)

### [👉 Open Your AlgosOne Account Now](https://tinyurl.com/mtdtz4rn)
## What Devices Can be Used to Access AlgosOne?

One of the things I appreciate is how **accessible AlgosOne is across devices**. You don’t need to install anything—just log in from your browser.

Supported devices include:

- **Desktop/Laptop** (Windows, macOS)
- **Tablets**
- **Smartphones** (Android & iOS)

It’s fully mobile-responsive, so you can check your trades and make changes on the go. That said, I’d love to see a **dedicated app** in the future with push notifications and more robust mobile features.

## AlgosOne – Supported Countries

AlgosOne is available in **most countries**, including:

- United States
- United Kingdom
- Canada
- Australia
- Most of Europe
- South Africa
- Parts of Asia and South America

There may be **restrictions in certain regions** due to local regulations, so it's best to check if the platform is accessible in your country before signing up.

## AlgosOne – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The AI engine behind AlgosOne constantly scans global markets to identify profitable trade setups. It’s like having a Wall Street analyst in your pocket—but with no coffee breaks.

### User-Friendly Interface

The dashboard is clean and intuitive. Even if you're totally new to trading, you won’t feel lost. Everything’s where you expect it to be, and settings are explained in simple terms.

### Mobile Accessibility

While there’s no native app (yet), the site works flawlessly on mobile browsers. You can monitor trades, deposit funds, and tweak settings directly from your phone.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set custom notifications for price changes, trade triggers, and account activity. It helps you stay in the loop without being glued to the screen.

### Multiple Asset Trading

AlgosOne isn’t just for crypto. You can trade:

- **Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.**
- **Forex pairs**
- **Stocks**
- **Commodities (like gold and oil)**

This makes it a one-stop shop if you’re looking to diversify your portfolio.

## Is AlgosOne a Scam?

Based on my testing and research, **AlgosOne is not a scam**. It does what it advertises: automates trading with AI and offers a functional platform for users of all levels.

That said, remember that **no trading tool is risk-free**. If someone promises you guaranteed returns, that’s a red flag. AlgosOne makes it clear that market risk is part of the deal.

I also appreciated the fact that they offer a **demo account**, which is usually a good sign that the platform isn’t just looking to take your money and run.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on AlgosOne?

To get started, you’ll need to **deposit a minimum of $250**. This is pretty standard across most platforms like this. It’s not a fee—you can use the full amount to trade.

If you’re unsure, I’d recommend starting with the demo account first and getting comfortable before putting down real money.

### AlgosOne Customer Support

Customer support is **available 24/7** via:

- **Live Chat** (fastest response)
- **Email Support**

I reached out with a few questions and got responses within minutes. They were polite, helpful, and didn’t push me to deposit more money like some shady platforms do.

## How do you start trading on AlgosOne?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head to the AlgosOne site and fill out the basic form (name, email, phone number). It takes less than 2 minutes.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once registered, you’ll be asked to **verify your identity** (standard KYC stuff). Then, make your **initial deposit of $250** via credit card, bank transfer, or crypto.

### Step 3: Start Trading

You can either test the platform using the **demo mode** or jump straight into live trading. Choose your trading preferences, and the algorithm will start analyzing and trading on your behalf.

## How to Delete an AlgosOne Account?

If you ever want to delete your account, just:

1. Contact customer support via live chat or email.
2. Request account deletion.
3. Make sure your funds are withdrawn beforehand.

They handled my request professionally when I tested this step.

## The Verdict

AlgosOne is a **solid choice** if you’re looking to dip into automated trading without getting a PhD in finance. It’s beginner-friendly, flexible, and performs well in both crypto and forex markets.

Sure, it’s not perfect. The lack of a mobile app and limited public info on the creators could be improved. But overall, it delivers what it promises and doesn’t feel shady like some other platforms out there.

If you're curious about algorithmic trading and want a hands-off way to get started, AlgosOne is definitely worth considering.

I want to know when I last did sth / took sth and want to be able to show a total. I think it's a bonus if this can be used on a phone, because that thing is kinda always in reach. 

Below is a screenshot from [Nomie](https://github.com/open-nomie/nomie6-oss) (OSS), which seems to fit my needs. But because this is the first and only application I found, I'm wondering if there are other apps that would be good for this.

Grateful for the immense hospitality.,"Daybreak, parabellum. Every morning, the citizens of this country of contrasts prepare to fight a daily invisible war. They rise in La Laguna where the desert breathes hot and dry, in Guadalajara where jacarandas paint purple shadows across colonial plazas, in Monterrey where mountains tower over the spires of modernity, in CDMX where ancient spirits slumber beneath cathedrals. Different skies, same dawn.

In Torreón, Gómez Palacio, Lerdo: The desert imposes a biblical sort of clarity despite the dust that settles on everything. The horizon stretches uninterrupted for seemingly interminable kilometers until it collides with the sierra. La Laguna's daughters and sons carry this vastness in the way they talk: direct, unadorned, with no time for frivolity when the sun is already climbing.

Three to four hours away, Monterrey's glass towers reach toward the iconic saddle-shaped mountain that cradles the city. Regiomontanos move with purpose through downtown streets, carrying northern pragmatism and endless, endless ambition. The industrial might that built this megapolis now funds art museums, university campuses, and an interminable forest of new apartment towers.

Further south, Guadalajara wears its contradictions proudly and beautifully. Basilica towers are obscured by apartment buildings, while protest graffiti transforms colonial columns into loud, unignorable manifestos. Fruit cart ladies arrange mangoes and bougainvillea cascades over cafés where students freely, unironically discuss philosophy. Aqui; tradicion and revolucion have learned to dance together, perhaps sometimes not gracefully, but with always characteristic tapatio rhythm. Admirable resiliency everywhere you turn; a city that refuses to be defined by one of its darkest chapters. 

La Capital is legion, and contains multitudes. Ancient pyramids beneath modern plazas, art deco palaces alongside brutalist monuments. Bellas Artes to Xochimilco, each colonia tells its own epic story while collectively writing an history far too vast for any single narrator, any single voice, any single lifetime. Mexico's greatest city breathes, expands, contracts, reinvents itself daily. Riding the metro is an experience I won't forget any time soon.

Despite their differences uncounted; in streetside establishments across these cities, the morning ritual continues identically. The metallic scrape of the comal, the rhythmic pat-pat-pat-pat of hands shaping tortillas. Coffee percolates while news radio recounts overnight tragedies with numbing efficiency. Workers adjust ties, smooth skirts, check phones; perfecting their armor for the day's battles.

Vast distances and terrible geography separate these cities. From desert, highland, valley, all the way to the mountain; but common threads bind them. Each morning, schoolchildren pledge allegiance beneath the eagle and serpent flag. Each evening, families create tiny fortresses of togetherness behind security gates. Each night, neon signs illuminate street food joints that become community anchors, unofficial therapist offices, witnesses to every shade of life between celebration and despair.

The daily war is fought on different fronts. Against traffic that transforms twenty kilometers into two-hour odysseys. Against bureaucracy that demands six forms when five would almost certainly do. Against history that refuses to stay buried and future promises perpetually put off. Against news headlines that reduce neighborhoods to crime statistics, ignoring the complex humanity behind each street.

Yet for every challenge, there are tear jerking stories of resilience. In La Laguna, desert flowers bloom after improbable rain. In Guadalajara, mariachi notes still color the night in their Plaza. In Monterrey ambition creates innovation from necessity. In Mexico City, ancient festivals transform strangers into community with rhythms that have remained unchanged for centuries and centuries and centuries.

The orange streetlight glow illuminates empty intersections at night. Moments of rare tranquility before dawn arrives with its familiar command: rise, prepare, continue. From northern desert to central valley, the soul of these cities speaks the exact same language; a language of persistence, of creativity in constraint, of finding beauty not despite struggle but within it, of thriving despite hard, hard odds.

Different mountains frame their horizons. Different cathedrals mark their centers. Different accents color their conversations. But when morning breaks across these majestic landscapes, the same sun rises on a people who have mastered the art of continuing, of carrying on, of fighting, of transforming daily survival into stubborn beautiful poetry.

Daybreak, parabellum. Mexico, the war never ends, but neither does the dance. Gracias totales, mi gente bonita. I hope to return again soon. ",8,1744697931.0,mexico,0,1.0,False
