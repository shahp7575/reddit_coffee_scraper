1hgvea3,https://www.reddit.com/r/unsentLoveLetters1st/comments/1hgvea3/penny_for_your_thoughts/,Penny for your thoughts…,"I’m sorry.

I’m sorry for loving and caring about you more profoundly than anyone else in your life ever has. 

I’m sorry for being the one who would drop everything in an instant whenever you needed me, or whenever you were in distress, without a second thought. 

I’m sorry for treating your dog as if they were my own child, nurturing them through illness with the same dedication I offered you.

I’m sorry for ever showing you my vulnerable and caring side which would sometimes include me getting emotional or my eyes become filled with tears when you would hurt me.

I’m sorry for the understanding I showed during the many times suspicions arose, suspicions I never voiced, though perhaps I should have. 

I’m sorry for not confronting you when anyone else, regardless of gender or identity, might have demanded answers. 

I’m sorry for holding your hair back, and rubbing your back while you were sick, taking care of you so tenderly in those vulnerable moments. More than once. 

I’m sorry for making you dinner, and I’m sorry for taking care of you, taking you to appointments and missing work to take care of you during these movements and several other moments while you weren’t physically ill with the flu, or a virus or some sort. 

I’m sorry for taking on the role of caregiver, for buying your prescriptions, your groceries, and covering the cost of every meal, every coffee. 

I’m sorry I would always hold doors open for you, as well as always using manners—“yes, please” and “no thank you.” 

Im sorry for complimenting you in a genuine manner, and always reminding you of how special you are, and how your presence on earth makes the world a better place because of everything your soul generated into it. 

I’m sorry for complimenting snd reminding you of how special you were in moments where you didn’t personally feel that way. 

I’m sorry for absorbing the hurtful words you threw my way, each one like a shard of glass, cutting deep—“don’t ever fucking talk to me again,” “we’re fucking done,” “I fucking hate you,” “you fucking bitch,” “you entitled piece of shit.” 

I’m sorry because I should’ve endured more of those words towards me, instead of speaking out about the wounds those words inflicted.

I’m sorry for always treating your family and friends with kindness, respect, and genuine interest. For the hours I spent making your condo spotless, every corner, every room—even the toilets and beneath your bed where dust and hair collected over years of neglect. 

Im sorry for standing up for you to others, going as far as filing a police report to ensure your safety when you felt threatened by a harmless homeless man who never bothered or approached you once. 

Im sorry for asking if you needed me to help you when you told me you were going to jump off your balcony, and then proceeded to leave the phone for eight minutes while I heard the balcony door open, and plead and begged for you not to hurt yourself… i’m sorry that you only came back to the phone when i threatened to call the police because i was scared you were going to hurt yourself.

Im sorry i didn’t go through with calling the police back a few days later after i called them and asked if they would then contact you. Im sorry because they would’ve potentially got you the help you needed but im sorry… 

I’m sorry because you told me i wanted to get you committed to a psychiatric hospital even though i never even alluded to that. Im sorry because that’s why i never called the police back. 

Im sorry for not giving into your paranoid snd manipulative thoughts snd tactics such as that one.  

I’m sorry for crafting surprise dates and for uttering words that moved you to tears, words that touched you in ways I never imagined possible. I’m sorry for singing to you, for the times we harmonized or when you broke down over songs your father loved, without me knowing their significance.

I’m sorry I was the man you said your deceased father would have adored. For getting pet insurance for your dog, for ensuring she was well-cared for with new food and vet visits. I’m sorry for the one time I forgot my wallet, prompting you to call me cheap—I never intended to upset you.

I’m sorry for the countless journeys I made by train and bus, traveling to be with you every Thursday through Sunday, sacrificing my time and comfort. I regret never questioning the absence of photos from your “girls trips” and for being subjected to your anger each time I asked about friends whose names I never learned.

I’m sorry you would pick out baby names and pressured me into having sex with you in order to potentially get you pregnant, even though I wasn’t ready because it was still early on, and because we needed to figure a lot out still for me to be in a place where I felt we were both ready for that. 

Actually… I did, several times. I even ensured I didn’t finish inside of you because my boundaries were routinely being crossed, and you continued to do this. You continued to physically restrain me from not moving away from you ever in those moments…

I’m sorry for performing oral on you when you would demand it, while cursing me out simultaneously. 

Remember when you bragged about demanding it later that one day before the Halloween party?

I’m sorry I didn’t just get you pregnant, even though you weren’t ready to be a mother. I’m sorry that I didn’t get you pregnant while there were things occurring behind my back, and bringing a child into that situation would’ve been disturbing.

I’m sorry you would grab my hips and pull me in closer while finishing, even as I resisted, all while telling me to “get you pregnant” and to “fill you up.” I’m sorry for feeling powerless in those moments, for not knowing how to assert myself and just jump from the bed and run… as fast as I could away from you…but you knew that we weren’t ready, and for how deeply that crossed my boundaries.

I’m sorry I didn’t give in to your selfish desires that were masqueraded with “loving intentions”, but in actuality they were for your much darker, self-serving purposes.

I’m sorry that you didn’t get pregnant and therefore couldn’t get out of the things you were doing behind my back the entire relationship as a result. Perhaps I would’ve tired if I knew the truth…

I’m sorry that you beamed with a smile that could light up the world, dreaming of beating your sister to the altar or into motherhood. I’m sorry for discussing marriage and homes in neighborhoods where you wanted to live, even though my job was an hour away.

I’m sorry for inquiring about your “business,” offering help with marketing, using my MBA and business acumen to support you, only to be met with evasion and silence. I’m sorry for questioning the lack of social media updates and your reluctance to speak of clients.

I’m sorry for being okay when you brushed me off after my aunt passed, for respecting your busy schedule over my grief. I’m sorry for always valuing your feelings, your emotions, even when they were wielded like weapons against me—I’m not a fighter, except when it comes to defending my heart.

I’m sorry you didn’t have more time to manipulate, gaslight, and abuse me. I’m sorry for the way your life is built on lies and deceit, for cheating on someone who loved you more than you could comprehend, all while living a double life as an escort.

I’m sorry you lied when we first met and throughout our relationship about working in a completely unrelated field of work than what you were actually doing…

I’m sorry I didn’t ask you more about the “buddies” you would constantly or randomly have and I would get upset despite never meeting them or knowing their names, or anything about them. I’m sorry you would get upset for me asking any further questions about your “buddies” after you brought those men up in conversation.

I’m sorry for you creating random fights between us, somehow making them my fault, and for me apologizing afterwards despite you conjuring these random fights to create space for a couple days between us so you could hang out with your buddies and get paid I suppose?

I’m sorry that I would’ve given you the financial freedom and wealth in addition to ensuring that you were the happiest woman to ever take a single breath on this earth. I’m sorry that you decided being an escort and being paid by lonely men was more important than what we had built and what you had told me you wanted for your life with me… our life.

I’m sorry that confronting you made you anxious, fearing your sister’s judgment. I’m sorry she never learned the truth. I regret the false accusations that led to my arrest, twice, for 25 hours each time, uprooting my life. I’m sorry I never crossed any boundaries, and I have all your texts that contradict the allegations.

I’m sorry I didn’t break bail again to reach out to you.

I’m sorry I didn’t want to break bail again and spend the holidays and beyond, in a jail cell, while I’m still in a mental prison without physically being in a jail or prison cell.

I’m sorry you wore my clothes in a TikTok shortly after my first arrest and flaunted your life as if my world hadn’t shattered.

I’m sorry we didn’t meet years earlier, when we lived across the street, shopped at the same stores, banked at the same place, walked our dogs in the same neighborhood. I wish I could have steered you away from the path you chose, even though I didn’t know you then.

I would’ve saved and protected you. I would’ve never left… ever.

I’m sorry for constantly lifting you up. I’m sorry for speaking to you all day everyday for a year, even when I was busy at work. I’m sorry for listening to you being annoyed with strangers while you were out and they didn’t seem to even do, or say anything to you to make you that upset.  

I’m sorry that you told me you were planning on moving out of the country in a month, despite telling me how we would continue to “work as a couple”. 

I’m sorry I was the one who came up with a plan for us that you seemed very happy with me doing. I’m sorry I accepted you being okay with moving far away from me without a job lined up… or so I believed. 

I’m sorry I didn’t get upset that you had this planned for a while and shared it shortly before you were supposed to move. Did you ever move? I doubt it. I wanted you to follow your dreams and do what made you happy. I always communicated this with you, and did so every time we spoke about this.

I’m sorry that on our last FaceTime call which was the last time I visually saw you… I held back tears because my intuition told me, “this could be the last time you ever see the love of your life”… 

I’m sorry for not acting on that as i should’ve with my months long suspicions about the other stuff…  

I’m sorry you didn’t apologize when I confronted you upon finding out the day before I confronted you about cheating on me and being an escort for our entire relationship. 

I’m sorry you sought out killing me and attempting to ruin my life as a better alternative. 

I’m sorry… I’m sorry because thats what you always wanted snd expected me to say even when it was you who was killing me… first slowly, and then quicker, and now for twisting a dagger of delusion. 

Im sorry that hearing someone you’re in a relationship with say they’re “sorry”. 

I’m sorry that this is one of your many kinks… I’m sorry for giving into your constant, daily abuse. 

And lastly…I’m sorry that despite everything, you remain a beautiful person, inside and out. I see the good in you, the potential for happiness and health, if only you hadn’t destroyed what we had. Your father would want you to be okay.

I remember the night you asked me to promise to always protect you and never leave, and how I held you as tears streamed down my face.

In that embrace, I felt your anxiety, your fear, your loneliness, and I promised to always stand by you, loving you more fiercely than the stars themselves.

“More than the aliens?” you asked, our little joke. Yes, more than those aliens you adore. “I love you, and I’ll love you forever. I’ll never let you go.”

I was there with my school mate and this 50M was sitting on the table next to us. Throughout the entire time he kept looking at us and I actually thought he was just some Pervy oldie just having fun looking at us but it then it continued for long time and it felt a bit creepy. Later he just came to our table and started asking me about my age, where I live and my school. I was weirded by it at first but later I came to know he was the professor from my own school. He expressed that he finds me attractive and would like to spend some time with me and that he was so lonely because his wife recently divorced. I truly felt bad for him and I thought what bad could even happen. I started meeting him in after school hours and just 2 days ago he called me to his home, made me really yummy lunch and then one thing led to another. He was playing Witcher and asked me to watch it. We were sitting watching it together and he started to touch me here and there. I started to feel good too and it was my first time experiencing such thing. He then took me to his bed room and started kissing me and slowly started to remove my trousers and top. My heart started beating too fast but I didn't want it to stop. I didn't resist him and just let him go for more. He moved his hand down my pants and i got so wet down there 🥵 he quickly pull my pants down put me upside down and began thrusting inside. That's when I knew I just lost my virginity to an old man and I don't know whether it was a right thing to do or not",0,1734501734.0,confessions,4,0.5,False

Thanks to u/Perfume_enthusiast95 ,i was able to grab Al rehab French coffee at such a Steal price🩷
It was packed very well and I absolutely love the perfume(Also because of nostalgic factor).
If you wanna know what it smells like,i guess everyone of us have had Kopiko Candy at some point in our life and i kid you not when i tell you it smells DITTO like Kopiko candy.
Love beauty and planet’s Coffee and warm vanilla bodywash is another scent that smells alike.
Also i am surprised how there is no alcohol smell even on the first spritz.It starts smelling like a Kopiko  candy right from the first Spritz.

de Bruijn, who is originally from Belgium and is the son of a Dutch mother and a German father who was himself the son of a Polish immigrant, waved away complaints of ""overcrowding in London"".

""It's always white people complaining; it's always white Londoners or White Britons complaining. Londoners and Brits are some of the richest in the world; if overcrowding is such an issue for you, then I would advise you to emigrate; they have the money to move away; emigrate to somewhere like Australia or Namibia; those two countries barely have any people in them and there are even people over there who even resemble White Britons, so you'll all feel right at home.""

de Bruijn also made a point of stating that he himself ""is not white"".

""No, I am not white; I do not identify as white; I identify as Dutch, as European. A recycling bag is white; white paint is white; this coffee mug is white; look at my skin, is it the same color as my coffee mug? No, no it is not.""",1,1734501560.0,stories,2,0.6,False

My first impressions are shared below:

Based on my time with it, I do not recommend playing Unhidden: Cozy Hidden Object on PSVR2, unless you are specifically looking for a ""cozy"" game.

I am not sure how to classify this as anything other than Educational for how I organize PSVR2 games I've covered on my YT channel because you need to learn word and object association and use that to complete the levels.

It loads instantly and gives you a pane with 18 diorama levels to choose:

1. Backyard
2. Baby Room
3. Bakery
4. Bathroom
5. Beauty Salon
6. Bedroom
7. Classroom
8. Coffee Shop
9. Cozy Lounge
10. Den
11. Garage
12. Greenhouse
13. Home Office
14. Kitchen
15. Laundry
16. Living Room
17. Police Department
18. Study Room

Click on any of these to start playing and press the lower button on left controller to exit. The only settings available on menu screen are for changing language. Once you complete a level you can either press lower button on left controller to get back to main menu or click next to go straight to next level in order.

Within each level your control is to use thumbstick on either controller to rotate the diorama and click using index finger trigger using your laser pointer to make selections. As with most VR games that try to confine you, you can move a bit using roomscale as well. The goal is to read up to 3 words displayed on your right hand controller in the environment to make them pop out of existence which gives you next word. Once all words are eliminated, the level is completed and you are graded 1-3 stars. There is no timer or any other indicator of how you were graded, but I assume it is based on time to complete.

Each level I played looks and sounds good (unique soundtracks per level), and is relaxing to play. The only issue I had is being able to select the Blue Light in the Police Station level ([16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XtKOB04Tfc&t=982s)) because I couldn't click through the window, so I had to use roomscale movement creativity to get that one done.

It is a game that reminds me of Travel The Words and I can see myself going through all 18 locations to find all the objects and maybe replay them to complete them fast enough for 3 Stars. The word list you get is randomized between replay so I think I would need to know the level and all its objects and word associations by memory to complete fast enough for 3 stars.

It does feature a Platinum which is for getting at least 1 start in all 18 levels and 3 stars in 6 of them (Backyard, Baby Room, Bakery, Bathroom, Study Room, & Police Department).

In the US, all 3 of these would be called a cart from my experience, though I have heard people on here say the first one could be called a buggy, basket, or carriage in other parts of the US, though I have only heard cart, shopping cart, or grocery cart and have only seen these words written. Weird how trolley aint in the vocab despite many of us would immediately understand what a shopping trolley or luggage trolley is. Basket, I have only heard for those little things you carry in your hand like a handbag.

While I have not flown in an airport in Canada, I had been to a supermarket in the Niagara Falls part of Canada where the first one was called a cart. I think in Canada, it would still be called carts for the second and third as well.

In Australia from my experience, all 3 of these would be called trolleys, especially for the first and second. Only time I have seen the word ""cart"" was when written as ""Takeaway Coffee Cart"", but that was like a food stand.

In New Zealand, from my experience, the first 2 are called trolleys, though I have read that New Zealand sometimes calls the first one a trundler, though during my short holiday in Auckland, when I went to the Woolies there, I had only seen them be written as trolleys. Havent heard what they are called though for the first 2. The third one from my experience has been called a cart according to Air New Zealand.

In UK and Ireland, I have heard people that I have met living in these countries tell me all 3 of these would be called a trolley.

In Singapore, I had never been outside the airport, but from JianHou Tan's YouTube videos and of Titan Academy, the first one would be called a trolley, while from my experience, the second would also be called a trolley, while the third one would be called a cart according to the Scooties who keep chanting ""Cart coming through!""

Because the bg music is sooo damn loud, in the Jap audio:
Angewomon sounds like Angelwomon.
Holydramon sounds like Holy Dragon.

Side note: Its so obvious that Angemon/Angewomon are Angelic Digimons.. the Jap Audio even sounds as such, but then the Eng dub pronouces it as ""Anjewomon"".. I also remember hearing ""Anjemon"" on some other Digimon film Eng Dub.. its so damn stupid.. its as stupid as that moronic ""prodigious"" statement (cringe) the Eng dub keep mentioning in the series, then again several of dialogue were dumb af

At a coffee shop now with a good friend, who also likes Digimon and we been talking about it for over an hour already Lol

He said that maybe Pokemon worked coz audiences would look mainly at the pokemons of Ash, Misty, and Brock (maybe also Gary, Jesse, and James too) battling, evolving, and collecting as the story progressed.. but capped only up to a total of 152 pokemons (at least for Gen01).. the ""Gotta catch em all"" was a good pitch and we all wanted to collect as many pokemon as we can..

In Digimon (1st Adventure), audiences started out with 7 Digi-destined partners (Hikari only joins later on) and we learn of their Digivolutions as the story progressed (even some baby versions) battling and digivolving... But they cant even get the names straight (as stated above with Tri).. plus there are just SO many other Digimons in the course of the adventure and they arent catching/collecting them.. they dont have that similar ""Gotta catch em all"" tagline..

I have a few ideas. The first two are definitely on my list, but then the rest are open to suggestions/critiques. Looking for non fruit-based syrups to have longer shelf life. Any advice on cocktail specs for each syrup is greatly appreciated too!

Christmas spice: Cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, allspice, and star anise. Can use to make mulled port or a rum punch

Brown sugar pecan: great in an old fashioned, not sure of other cocktails

Cardamom: Could make a great thai ice coffee white russian or a espresso martini

Rosemary White pepper: A bit out there, but I could see it being really good in a martini or a gin-based cocktail

Coffee: Also good in an old fashioned, but very redundant if I want to encourage them to be used in coffee as well

I also recently bought some Lapsang Souchong tea, which is very smoky and I'm sure could be used in a great cocktail if made right.

Other syrups that I like but aren't super Christmas-y are Black Pepper or Coconut. Any suggestions for the four bottles I'll be making? Thank you!",1,1734500684.0,cocktails,0,1.0,False

Hilary Swank has been quite prominent, and being seen banged up, bleeding, and running scared has only added fuel to the (cabin) fire.

But what about Joel's character? I believe he's too old to be Adam's colorectal surgeon brother with the confronting coffee table book, with a possible 13-14 year age gap..............unless baby Adam was a mistake (like his character, and shit storyline.............""oh no he did *not*?""

But, nosey sibling wanting closure has legs, no? Saw a post the other day about how many single child households are in the team........a statistically anomalous amount, I reckon. Someone other than Travis has to have a sibling, and Joel would fit the older sibling trope right down to the ground.

Imagine stepping off a plane into the heart of Africa, where the air is thick with the scent of the bush, and the distant roars of lions remind you just how wild this place can be. This isn’t just any honeymoon—it’s an adventure, a journey through some of the most breathtaking landscapes on Earth.

As you start your new life together, there’s no better way to do it than surrounded by wildlife, under endless starry skies, and [sharing intimate moments](https://www.easytravel.co.tz/tanzania-safari-tours/honeymoon-safari/) with your loved one. From the Serengeti’s endless plains to the privacy of a luxury lodge in the Ngorongoro Crater, a safari honeymoon is an experience you’ll never forget.

Here’s what it’s like, from my own experience.

# The Serengeti: Where Adventure Meets Romance

The Serengeti is one of those places that takes your breath away—literally. You step out of your safari vehicle, and the vastness of the land stretches before you, dotted with herds of wildebeest, giraffes, and zebras. This is where the Big Five roam freely, where every sunrise brings a new adventure and every sunset a story to tell.

On our honeymoon, my partner and I woke up to the sound of elephants passing by our tent. We sat on our private deck, sipping coffee as the sun rose over the savannah, casting a golden light over the plains. It’s a moment of pure magic, feeling like you’re the only two people on the planet.

One of the highlights of our trip was a hot air balloon ride over the Serengeti. As the sun climbed higher, we soared above the landscape, watching as the animals moved below—herds of wildebeest following their ancient migration routes, lions stalking their prey, and cheetahs racing across the open plains.

It was an unforgettable way to start our honeymoon, with the world spread out beneath us. After the ride, we enjoyed a private breakfast in the bush, set up just for us by our guide. It’s those little touches—being the only ones in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by nature—that make this experience so special.

# Ngorongoro Crater: A Natural Paradise

Next up was the Ngorongoro Crater, often called the “eighth wonder of the world.” As you drive down into the caldera, you’re hit with the realization that this isn’t just a hole in the ground—it’s a whole world of its own.

The landscape changes dramatically as you descend, from dusty plains to lush grasslands. It’s like stepping into a different time, where the animals are free to roam and you’re just a small part of the ecosystem.

At the Ngorongoro Crater Lodge, we had a view that was nothing short of spectacular—looking out over the rim as the sun set, watching the shadows lengthen over the crater floor. The lodge itself was a mix of luxury and traditional African design, with hand-carved furniture and décor that made you feel like royalty.

We had our own private villa, complete with a plunge pool, and a personal butler who made sure we had everything we needed. It’s the little things that make a difference—finding a rose petal path leading to our bed, chocolates on the pillow, and a hot stone bath drawn each evening.

During our time in the crater, we went on game drives and bush walks with our guide, Paul. He was amazing—knowledgeable, funny, and full of stories about the animals and their habits. We tracked rhinos, watched as a pride of lions feasted on a recent kill, and even spotted a leopard lounging in a tree.

Paul would stop the vehicle, cut the engine, and just let us listen to the sounds around us—the call of a distant bird, the rustle of leaves as a troop of monkeys passed by. It was like being in another world, and it was a perfect way to celebrate our new life together.

# Romantic Sundowners in the Wild

One of the most magical parts of our honeymoon was watching the sunset over the African landscape. We spent hours driving through the bush, spotting animals along the way—elephants, giraffes, and even a family of warthogs. As the sun began to dip below the horizon, we found a quiet clearing, and our guide set up a table and chairs, complete with a bottle of champagne and some snacks.

As we sipped our drinks, we watched the sky turn shades of pink and orange, the sun setting behind the acacia trees. It was the most romantic moment of our lives—just the two of us, with nothing but the sounds of the wild around us.

After the sun had set, we were treated to a private dinner under the stars. Our guide and the chef had prepared a meal for us in the middle of nowhere, with lanterns lighting the path and a campfire crackling nearby.

It was like something out of a movie—the stars overhead, the sounds of the bush all around us, and the soft glow of the lanterns casting a warm light over our table. We ate by candlelight, sharing stories and laughter and feeling closer than ever. It was a moment of pure bliss, and it was one of the many reasons why our honeymoon was so unforgettable.

# The Magic of a Private Safari Lodge

For those seeking even more privacy and intimacy, consider booking a stay at a private safari lodge. We had the pleasure of staying at a small, exclusive lodge in the Serengeti, just the two of us, with our own private guide and chef.

It was like having our own piece of Africa—no other guests or vehicles around. We woke up each morning to the sound of the bush, our guide ready to take us on a new adventure.

Our days were spent exploring—tracking animals on foot, watching as a lioness taught her cubs how to hunt, and spotting birds that were as colorful as they were elusive. Our guide was a local with a deep knowledge of the land and its inhabitants.

He made the safari personal, sharing stories about his childhood in the bush and teaching us about the plants and trees that we passed by. It was an incredible experience, one that made our honeymoon even more special.

# Preparing for Your Honeymoon Safari

Before embarking on your own safari adventure, there are a few things to consider. First, pack wisely. The days can be hot, so lightweight, breathable clothing is a must.

Don’t forget your hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen to protect yourself from the sun’s rays. Comfortable shoes are essential for walking safaris and bush walks. We packed hiking boots, and they were a lifesaver when we were trekking through the bush.

Getting the necessary vaccinations is also important. Consult with your doctor about malaria and other preventable diseases, and make sure you’re up to date on your shots. It’s also a good idea to bring along some basic medications—headache tablets, insect repellent, and a first-aid kit—just in case.

Your guide will provide you with all the information you need, from what to pack to how to behave on game drives. They’re there to make your experience as smooth and enjoyable as possible.

# Final Thoughts

A honeymoon in Africa isn’t just a trip—it’s the beginning of a shared journey. It’s about creating memories that will last a lifetime, witnessing the beauty of the wild, and finding love in the most unexpected places. Whether you choose the Serengeti, the Ngorongoro Crater, or a private lodge in the bush, your safari honeymoon will be unlike any other. It’s an adventure you’ll remember forever, and it’s a perfect way to start your new life together.

So pack your bags, grab your partner’s hand, and prepare for an experience you’ll never forget. Africa is calling—are you [ready to answer](https://www.easytravel.co.tz/tanzania-safari-tours/honeymoon-safari/)?",1,1734500186.0,Honeymoons,0,1.0,False

","Me (23) and my boyfriend (23) are going through a rough patch that constantly comes around. We were long distance and he moved in with me this year to finally be in person, but it's not what I expected. I had previously met him in college and knew he was a very social person. He could make friends with anyone and was always well liked. When we were long distance, he would often be hard to get ahold of as his friends are ""in person"" and that's who he prioritizes, which I understand since they're long time friends and we were pretty new in general. Now that he has moved in with me, he still prioritizes his friends and blames the fact that I have no friends as our issue. If we are together and he gets a call from anyone, he always answers and will usually just chat with them for hours  or make plans to game with them when we get home. I don't mind that but it's essentially everyday. Ever since he moved here he hasn't been able to hold down a job, his mom either assists with his portion of the rent or he's a few days late because he would rather get drunk gaming with his friends the night before and sleep through work. He has no sense or responsibility towards a job and assumes everyday he can work whatever shift he wants. I pay for most thinks outside of rent so planning dates (which he has followed through once without me nagging about it this year) is difficult as I don't want to constantly plan, pay, and work full time when he has plenty to spare to at least come up with something. My idea of spending time is cooking dinner/ getting coffee, coming home and cuddling and watching a movie. His is getting the coffee and taking a call to make plans for later, we get home and he wants to talk or game with a friend, and if I say anything it's him getting mad saying ""well we spend time we got coffee together."" He has many friends so the calls are from multiple people who prioritize their own life first and when they have free time, call my boyfriend to hang. My boyfriend makes me the free time and anyone who calls the priority. I tried to give an example to him to get accross what his friends are doing with a married couple that we know. They're  most of the time together spending time and prioritize eachother so they're hard to call but always call back when they have the time, not just his friend prioritizing everyone else mostly and leaving his wife as a time placeholder like how I'm treated. I'm told again it's cause I have no friends and that ""those friends are married so it makes sense that they would prioritize eachother"". I get I don't have friends since I really focused on a career, but when I'm at work I don't talk to him at all. The only time I ever felt he tried was when I was working 75 hour weeks at two jobs and only saw him to eat a meal before I pass out, and I worked really hard to try to get a job that paid well for me to only need the 1 so we can have more time together. But at this point I feel like I'd rather go back to those 75 hour weeks cause I at least felt like he missed me in someway and made me for a couple hours a priority. I get I don't have friends outside of work but it's because I always made sure to focus on work and him. How do I get him to see that if he truly wants to spend the rest of his life with me like he says, he has to at least make me a priority in some retrospect without needing to be married first. I really love and admire how social he is, but I don't feel that he has to make everyone else the main focus to have so many friends. So AITH. ",1,1734500102.0,AITH,1,1.0,False

Cindy decided to do the opposite.

Her products aren’t anything crazy, but her marketing strategy was genius...

She knew women wanted support in feeling positive about their age.

No brand was selling the solution.

So, she built her brand BOOM! around pro-aging and the results are insane...

The Boomstick is her main product.

[Boomstick](https://preview.redd.it/xtxtruejmj7e1.jpg?width=1304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=62d9a7dd0f2546c62ff56d77665ecc56ad085fb1)

It’s plain, boring and easy to use, and it only costs her around $8 per unit.

Like similar products, it adds a healthy and vibrant look to women’s skin.

It does nearly $800K/mo on Amazon...

The lesson in here is this:

1. She took an established product
2. She made it for a specific niche
3. She used Amazon to market it

I use this same strategy.

This is something anyone can do with a little creativity and good marketing...

# 1- Find an established product

You want something that solves a problem for a specific niche.

Start with a market like aging women.

Then go on [https://Kalodata.com](https://honeysyed.com/kalodata) and [https://Junglescout.com](https://honeysyed.com/junglescout) to start finding products that are already doing $60K+ a month.

# 2- Market it for a specific niche

Don’t just sell coffee... -> Sell coffee for entrepreneurs

Don’t just sell hair-growth supps... -> Sell it for men in their 20s

Don’t just sell gym clothes... -> Sell clothes for oversized women

Be the top solution for a specific group.

# 3- Get your products developed

Find a supplier on Alibaba. 

Find a package designer on [Fiverr](https://honeysyed.com/fiverr). 

Use Amazon FBA to do the shipping.

You can easily create any product and brand these days on a small budget.

If you have a good idea, you can find others to do the rest of the work.

I’ve used this exact strategy myself...

My husband and I sell 9 “boring products” in unique niches that do $4M per year.

They’re product you use every day.

1hgute6,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1hgute6/what_do_we_owe_our_metas/,What do we owe our metas?,"I am fresh off a pretty devastating breakup of a long term relationship that happened in part due to issues with my now ex meta. 

Before anyone feels the need to say it, I know it’s the hinge’s job to manage their own relationships with their partners and that the hinge often isn’t doing a very good job when a lot of issues crop up between metas and all that jazz… I don’t need that lesson. 

My former partner did screw up in that department and contributed to some of the resentment that built and ultimately erupted between my ex meta (Apple F) and me (F) and my ex (banana M, we’re all late 30s to late 40s).Trust me I have and do fully hold him accountable for that. 

Apple and I both said that we wanted to be somewhere between parallel and garden party at the start. We’re both introverts and we don’t have much in common. That was fine with me and for the first half or more of the relationship we had a distant but kind and respectful relationship.  

Last March Banana had a medical crisis and it brought into very sharp focus how incredibly awkward and kind of tense things felt between Apple and me during one of our first ever one on one interactions. 

Once he was better, I had asked Banana if he and Apple would be willing to get together maybe once every other month to have coffee. I explained that I wasn’t looking for a friendship and I wasn’t trying to move to kitchen table poly or anything like that. I communicated very clearly that if Apple was open to it I wanted us to get our relationship to where when we are in the same place at the same time it can be comfortable and have some ease to it versus being horribly tense and awkward. I really got the impression that there were not any bad feelings, but neither of us really knew how to engage with one another. I thought coffee every couple of months was like a pretty low stakes, low low effort way for us to just get a little more comfortable in each other‘s presence.

Banana talked to Apple and reported to me that she responded very positively was open to that happening and that we would schedule something. But it kept not being scheduled and I kept bringing it up to him and he would report that she was really busy or really stressed out or had a lot going on… There was just always a reason it couldn’t happen. And he was also continuously reassuring me that she still wanted to. It was just life getting in the way and that they appreciated me being patient.

At the beginning of July I almost ended the relationship because I was very dissatisfied by how Banana’s relationship agreements with Apple were restricting my relationship with banana. And four months after I had made the initial request, Apple still had not made herself available for coffee but was still insisting it was going to happen. Just a quick note, she does not have kids, his kids are all adults and they work normal 9 to 5 jobs and she doesn’t really have an active social life and there were many many many weekends that they were just sitting at home together that it would’ve been really easy for us to get together and have coffee. But it just kept getting blown off.

During that discussion Banana made a lot of promises regarding changes he was going to make in his relationship with Apple to make his and my relationship a little bit more equitable. I agreed to give him some time to make those changes.

About a week later, he had a different medical issue come up and it was determined that he would need a pretty major surgery that was going to have a long recovery time. 

I agreed to drop the outstanding issues because banana and apple both became extremely stressed out about the medical issue and the pending surgery, which was scheduled for October. I was very compassionate and supportive and tabled my own issues except that I again stressed that before the surgery happened, which would probably spell Apple and I being in the same place at the same time I’d really like to get together. I’m sure that you can guess that that didn’t happen.

I was also really apprehensive because one of their rules is they don’t have partners over when the other partner is home. knowing he was going to be homebound for a couple of months and knowing the only way I’d be able to see him is at their house and that she is always there, it seemed like there was a chance I would go a couple months without seeing my partner. 

At the 11th hour leading up to his surgery Apple agreed to allow me to enter their home while she was present. The interactions I had with her there were unsurprisingly awkward and uncomfortable.  But this time I was pissed about it and very resentful that I was in this uncomfortable situation that didn’t need to be so uncomfortable. Had we, you know, taken the time to get to know each other a little bit. Not that I had been asking for seven months at this point.

She had approval to work from home full-time for the duration of his recovery. Banana asked Apple to please go into the office once a week for both of their mental health (he was concerned about too much uninterrupted togetherness for the both of them) and for the benefit of his and my relationship and she agreed. She followed through on that exactly twice which was also very frustrating. 

She went once and then didn’t go for a couple of weeks. Banana and I had a discussion about why it really sucked that he wasn’t holding her accountable to following through on something he requested and she agreed to. He had a conversation with her about it, and she apologized and went the following week and then never did again. 😏

All of that just left an extremely bitter taste in my mouth. shortly, before Thanksgiving, he was recovered enough that he was gonna be returning to work. So we finally had the conversation about all the outstanding stuff that I had agreed to table until he was recovered. 

We had a really hard conversation and he went home and had several hard conversations with Apple  and it was like all of a sudden, all of these things that had been impossible, things I wasn’t even asking for were being offered, and Apple was completely on board with it..

I was honest with him that it felt like too much of an abrupt change too quickly and that I didn’t trust it. There had been a lot of times that Apple had agreed to things, but then not followed through or changed her mind, so for her to be saying she was completely fine and had no issues whatsoever with things that have been hard and fast rules for a long time just felt ….. not real to me. I told him I was going to take a wait-and-see approach, but that I had a lot of trepidation and I was going to expect to actually see the things he was talking about happening to actually happen. Including that he told me that Apple felt badly about us not getting together and that she was going to reach out to me in the next day or two to schedule a time for her and I to get coffee and clear the air. He said those were her exact words.

And I’m over here just waiting and seeing. A few days go by and unsurprisingly I don’t hear anything. Then he tells me that life for Apple has once again become unmanageably busy and stressful and would it be OK for us to get together the second week of December and I said it was fine, she could reach out to me to schedule that. And I’m waiting and seeing.

Last Wednesday I received a text from her that is not at all an invitation to get coffee. It is instead an entire essay about how she does not want to have a friendship with me.

I don’t think I’ve ever been more confused by a text message in my entire life. 

Seriously, she kept repeating and stressing that she hoped I didn’t take it personally and wasn’t too hurt that she didn’t want to be friends with me. Girl what? What are you even talking about? She also said she didn’t wanna do regular coffee, but that she’d be willing to do an occasional group activity with me and banana.  Which I’m kind of like what else is an occasional group activity but getting together every couple months to have coffee but OK? But she was very specific that she didn’t have the time energy bandwidth or interest in having a friendship with me. 

I wrote back a very polite email explaining that I understood and appreciated her reaching out but that I was extremely confused because I was expecting a text about coffee plans and because not once have I ever requested a friendship with her. 

The first thought that popped up was maybe banana is doing a really really bad job communicating things to Apple and that she didn’t have all the information and had somehow gotten the impression that I was requesting a friendship. 

So I also wrote that I was wondering if there’s been miscommunication, I’ve been requesting since March   
for us to get together every other month and have coffee, banana said you were good with it but there’s been no follow through and it’s really never been made clear to me why there’s been no follow through and it’s been kind of frustrating for me and then I was told to you expect a message from you to get together for coffee, but you’re sending me a very different type of message and so I’m just very confused and hope you can clarify a bit. 

When I tell you, I got the shittiest meanest message back from this woman….

She was “well aware” I had been making that request and yes, she had agreed to it but she has a whole lot of other priorities and stress in her life so she chose not to prioritize that and instead chose to prioritize her own well-being. Um, OK? Like you could’ve just said that at some point? And she wasn’t going to apologize for living her life in the way that she had to to get by. Again, girl what?

She also said that she was just being polite when using the word friend and that what she meant was that she didn’t want to have any kind of a relationship with me. She just used the word friend to be polite and that I should replace the word friend with acquaintance, but that would literally mean she sent me a message talking about how much she doesn’t have the time or energy to be an acquaintance with me?

And then she said to me that if it was that important to me, I could’ve reached out directly to her instead of stewing for the last nine months and that nine months was an awful long time for me to not take any initiative or speak up about my needs. 

🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯

The needs I had spoken up about repeatedly to banana of which she had just admitted she was well aware. But apparently that wasn’t valid. I was instead supposed to reach out to the person that I had no relationship with who was repeatedly dodging my attempts to have the most casual relationship, to make a request to her that banana had already made, and that she had already agreed to. That’s apparently on me. And she said in this second of messages to me that she was frustrated and exhausted with how this was playing out. Oh. Ok. 

So that was really the final straw because it made it very clear to me that she is not participating in good faith and that I was right not to trust her sudden absolute change of heart about relationship rules and that I’m no longer sticking around for this nonsense. So I ended it and it is incredibly painful because I did actually have a very wonderful dynamic with banana that I am devastated to lose, but I was starting to lose respect for myself in this scenario. and yes, before anyone says it, I know there is a lot of blame on him.

Ever since I’ve been thinking a lot about what do metas owe to each other? If anything at all? It seems that the common wisdom here is that metas don’t owe each other a relationship and I think that’s fair and I think that can get really messy when real life comes into play with things like medical emergencies. 

Is it that metas don’t really owe anything to one another but that they do owe their partner support of their other relationships? In polyamory, do we owe our partners our support for their other relationships?

I feel like the crux of the second message from Apple was that she didn’t owe me anything and I was irritating her with my existence. I feel like she’s strung me along for nine months and then said lol no I don’t want anything to do with you and then insulted me?

The overwhelming feeling the last couple days is that I was owed better than that but then I keep wondering did she actually owe me anything at all?  Thoughts?",2,1734499985.0,polyamory,1,1.0,False
1hgutdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hgutdy/is_my_mother_toxic_or_am_i_just_a_bad_son/,is my mother toxic or am i just a bad son?,"Hi, im using a throwaway account.

Just like any other teenager, i(19m) have goals, expectations and boundaries set aside for myself. But i feel like my mother just doesnt respect them. Theres ALOT of things im gonna mention here so pls just hear me out. im going to try to be as unbiased as possible so i can get actual good advice.

firstly, i think my mother is condenscending. everytime, we have an argument, she guilt trips me. she mentions things like ""i gave birth to you"", ""i give u food and water and a roof over ur head"". everytime i try to raise a point, she retaliates by saying im rude and arrogant and that i should ""mind my words"". she refuses to understand my perspective and demands she is always right.

secondly, she doesnt respect my boundaries. im an introvert. i prefer being by myself and just doing my own things. my mother seems to HATE that. she demands i sit next to the family every single second and talk to them. everytime im by myself, she demands me to join her. i absolutely HATE IT. i need my alone time. when i voiced out to her about this, she pushed it aside, saying that im rude and selfish and i dont care about the family.

thirdly, she keeps poking her nose into my personal life. she demands to know where im going all the time, who im going with etc. she even regularly checks my phone (whatsapp, ig, tiktok, everything). when i told my friends about this, they told me its not normal and that she's too nosy. my mother claims that im secretive and that i never share anything with her. IF I DO, IT EITHER TURNS INTO AN ARGUMENT OR A NAGGING SESSION. she shuts me off and doesn't care about my feelings. i just dont feel comfortable sharing anything with her. she even went as far as kicking me out of my room and forcing me to sleep with her. yes, i dont have my own room. i share room with my mom.

next, shes just toxic in general. she doesn't have a good relationship with her side of the family. she's always arguing with her only sibling (her parents died) and everyone in my dad's side of the family. to the point that everyone blocked her. she's always gossiping about her friends and our relatives. if i have a different opinion from her, she yells at me and says im not being supportive and that i should be agreeing with whatever she feels. 

next, she micromanages my life. she decides what time i sleep, what time i wake up, what i do etc. she even decided my uni major without discussing with me (though that was i wanted to do anyway). when i express certain desires like wanting to purchase a new shoe or t-shirt, she starts berating me. I EARN MY OWN MONEY. i have a job and all the money in my bank account is MY HARD EARNED MONEY. yet, she decides what i do with it. she hates it if i buy smth like coffee (which i hardly do) and says that i need to pay for my own uni fees. i would just like to mention that my family isn't poor, we are financially stable. sure, its not my parents responsibility to pay for my uni fees but like do they srsly expect me to pay for everything? I PAY OWN PHONE BILLS, INSURANCE AND TRANSPORTATION (i dont have a car and i live in a country with good public transportation).

i admit i have made a few mistakes in the past. by mistakes i mean small things like, yelling back, buying unnecessary stuff. but im not a criminal or a gangster or wtv. i just dont get it. why is she like that? she doesn't act the same way towards my older brother. i feel like a prisoner in my own home. i cant do anything i want to cause of her. everytime my friends ask me to hang out with them, i get so scared of asking her. 

i know there are people who will say ""sit down with her, have chat, talk about your feelings to her"". i have done that. didn't work. she thinks she's right all the time. if i disagree with her or share my feelings, im ""rude"". if i didnt listen to her instructions, im ""selfish"". if i just listen to her nagging and dont respond, im ""arrogant"".

my mom keeps guilt tripping me too. ""its cause of me u have a roof over ur head etc"", ""i worked so hard for you but u never appreciate me"". there have been times where i exploded and just start arguing back, but she gets violent. she punches and slaps me, making me helpless. my father is an alcoholic so i cant count on him. we dont really talk. my brother is just doing his own things. hes out most of the time and we dont really talk either. 

as of now, im still living with my family. i just want to earn enough money for me to leave the house. the problem is i live in a country where filial piety is highly stressed by society. additionally, here, you are a legal adult only at 21. and even if i do leave, where am i going to stay? the cost of living is crazy high here (one of the highest in the world). i cant afford anything. sure, i have a job right now but it isn't enough. 

honestly, just give me a reality check or smth idk. i cant help but think that maybe im the problem. am i just a bad son or is my mother really toxic? help, please.",3,1734499984.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

I find the process of grinding coffee to be unappealing. Here's what is going on.

Grinders don't seem cleanable.

I had a revolting experience getting coffee ground at a supermarket because the grinder was also doing spices and nuts and such. So the flavor of the ground coffee was ruined. I'm not doing that again. The public grinder doesn't seem like it's ever cleaned or even is actually cleanable.

Then there's the option of buying a home electric grinder. I've used small handheld ones. They always eventually short out, I think because I am wiping them down with paper towel + dish soap + water and then rinsing them. So the water is getting inside them. Am I just not supposed to clean them?

This is why I now just use a mortar and pestle. It is only good for a pour-over grind and this is the only kind I drink anyway. I only do dark roast and use a lot of beans. The point is that the mortar and pestle are completely cleanable, and it seems like nothing else is. I'm missing something here.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Water is essential for our bodies to function properly. It plays a critical role in various bodily functions, including regulating temperature, maintaining joint lubrication, and facilitating nutrient absorption. But how much water should you be drinking each day? Understanding the ideal daily water intake can help you stay healthy and energized.

### Determining Daily Water Needs

The amount of water you need each day can vary based on several factors. Here are key considerations:

- **Your Body Weight:** A common recommendation is to drink half your body weight in ounces. For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, aim for about 75 ounces of water daily.
- **Activity Level:** If you exercise regularly or engage in physical labor, your water needs will increase. During strenuous activities, it's best to hydrate before, during, and after workouts.
- **Climate:** Hot and humid weather can lead to increased sweating, which can double your daily fluid requirements. In cold environments, you may not feel as thirsty, but you still need to hydrate.
- **Health Status:** Factors like illness, fever, or digestive issues can impact hydration needs. Pregnant or breastfeeding women also require more water than usual.

### Common Recommendations

While individual needs may vary, several general guidelines can help you determine how much water to drink:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- The **National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine** suggests about 3.7 liters (or 13 cups) for men and 2.7 liters (or 9 cups) for women daily, including all beverages and food.
- The ""8x8 rule"" recommends eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily, totaling about 2 liters, or half a gallon. This is an easy guideline to remember!

### Recognizing Water Intake from Foods

Don’t forget that your daily hydration comes from more than just water. Foods can also contribute to your overall fluid intake. Here’s a list of food items known for their high water content:

- **Cucumbers:** About 95% water
- **Tomatoes:** Around 95% water
- **Watermelon:** Approximately 92% water
- **Strawberries:** Roughly 91% water
- **Spinach:** Almost 92% water

Including these foods in your diet can help meet your hydration goals more easily.

How Different Factors Influence Your Daily Water Needs
------------------------------------------------------

Understanding how much water you should drink every day can be tricky. There are many factors that affect your daily water needs, and recognizing these can help you stay hydrated. Here’s a closer look at what influences how much water you should aim for.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Body Weight

Your body weight plays a huge role in determining how much water you should drink. A common recommendation is to drink half your body weight in ounces. For example, if you weigh 160 pounds, aim for about 80 ounces of water each day. This can vary based on other factors such as activity level and climate.

### Activity Level

If you're active or exercise regularly, your body will require more water. During physical activities, you lose fluids through sweat and respiration. To replenish what you lose, drink extra water before, during, and after your workouts. Here’s a basic breakdown:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Light Activity:** Add an extra 8 ounces of water.
- **Moderate Activity:** Aim for 16 ounces per hour.
- **High Intensity:** Consider drinking 24 ounces or more during intense sessions.

### Environment

The climate where you live affects your hydration needs. Hot and humid weather increases your chance of dehydration as your body loses more sweat. In colder climates, you might not feel as thirsty, but it’s important to drink enough water since indoor heating can also dehydrate you. Always listen to your body and adjust your intake accordingly.

### Diet

Your food choices impact your water intake as well. Foods with high water content contribute to your overall hydration. Some examples include:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Watermelon
- Cucumbers
- Oranges
- Celery
- Strawberries

In contrast, high-sodium or high-protein diets may require you to drink more water to help your kidneys function properly. Keep this in mind when planning your meals.

### Age and Gender

Your age and gender also play significant roles in determining your daily water needs. Generally, men require more water than women due to a larger muscle mass. As you age, your body may not sense thirst as well, which means older adults need to be more mindful of their water intake.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Health Conditions

Certain health conditions can influence how much water you should drink. If you have kidney stones, urinary tract infections, or are experiencing fever or vomiting, it’s vital to increase your intake to help with recovery. Medications can also impact hydration. Some can cause increased urination or dehydration, prompting you to consume more fluids.

### Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, your water needs increase. Expecting mothers should drink around 10 cups (about 80 ounces) of water daily to support their growing baby. Nursing mothers may need even more, approximately 13 cups (or about 104 ounces) to ensure adequate milk production. Staying hydrated is key for both you and your child's health.

### Listening to Your Body

Ultimately, the best way to determine how much water you need each day is to listen to your body. Thirst is a natural signal that you need hydration. Additionally, assessing your urine color can help inform you about your hydration status; pale yellow urine typically indicates proper hydration, while dark yellow suggests you may need to drink more.

By considering these different factors, you can better understand how much water you should be drinking each day. Tailor your intake according to your lifestyle and pay attention to your body’s signals. Proper hydration not only supports your physical health but also enhances your overall well-being.

### Myth 1: You Need to Drink Eight Glasses of Water a Day

While you may have heard the advice to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily, this isn't one-size-fits-all. Your water needs depend on various factors including:

- Your age
- Your weight
- Your activity level
- The climate you live in

Some people might need more than eight glasses, while others might need less. The best approach is to listen to your body’s thirst signals.

### Myth 2: You Can’t Hydrate with Anything Other Than Water

While drinking water is vital, many other beverages and foods can also hydrate you. For example:

- **Fruits:** Watermelon and oranges are great sources of hydration.
- **Vegetables:** Cucumbers and lettuce have high water content.
- **Beverages:** Herbal teas and broth also contribute to your daily hydration.

Don’t forget that every bit of fluid counts towards your daily needs!

### Myth 3: You Only Need to Drink Water When You’re Thirsty

Thirst is a sign that your body is already starting to dehydrate. Waiting until you feel thirsty can lead to inadequate hydration levels. It's better to drink water throughout the day. Consider setting reminders to sip on water regularly, even if you don’t immediately feel thirsty.

### Myth 4: If Your Urine Is Clear, You’re Fully Hydrated

The color of your urine can be a useful gauge for hydration, but it’s not a definitive measure. Clear urine can indicate good hydration, but it can also mean over-hydration. A pale yellow color is often the ideal sign of proper hydration. Factors like diet and medications can also affect urine color.

### Myth 5: Sports Drinks Are Necessary for Hydration

Sports drinks are often marketed as the go-to solution for hydration, especially during exercise. However, they are mainly beneficial for long-duration or high-intensity activities. For regular workouts or daily activities, water is usually sufficient. Additionally, many sports drinks have added sugars and calories that can lead to weight gain if consumed unnecessarily.

### Myth 6: Coffee and Alcohol Dehydrate You

While caffeine and alcohol have a diuretic effect, which can lead to increased urination, they don’t necessarily cause dehydration. When consumed in moderation, coffee and some types of alcoholic beverages can contribute to hydration. It's vital, however, to balance these drinks with water intake.

### Myth 7: You Should Drink Water Before You Feel Thirsty

The common belief is that consuming a large amount of water before feeling thirsty prevents dehydration, but this isn’t always the case. Drinking too much water rapidly can lead to a condition known as hyponatremia or water intoxication. Moderation is the key; sip water consistently throughout the day, especially in warm weather or when exercising.

### Benefits of Staying Hydrated

Now that you understand the myths surrounding hydration, it's essential to recognize the benefits of drinking enough water:

Practical Tips for Ensuring You Drink Enough Water Daily
--------------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is essential for your overall health and well-being. Drinking enough water daily can lead to various health benefits, including enhanced energy levels, improved digestion, and better skin appearance. However, many people often overlook their hydration needs. Here are practical tips to help you drink enough water every day.

### Understand Your Daily Water Needs

First, it’s essential to know how much water you should be drinking. While recommendations can vary, a common guideline suggests drinking about 8 cups (64 ounces) of water a day. However, factors like your weight, activity level, and climate can influence your specific needs. A useful formula is to divide your body weight in pounds by 2. That number represents the ounces you should aim to drink daily.

### Make Water Easily Accessible

To encourage yourself to sip water throughout the day, keep it within arm's reach. Here are some tips to ensure you have access to water:

- Carry a reusable water bottle with you everywhere you go.
- Place a jug of water on your desk or counter.
- Fill a pitcher and keep it in the fridge for easy pours.

### Set Reminders

In our busy lives, it’s easy to forget to drink water. Setting reminders on your phone or using an app dedicated to tracking your water intake can be incredibly helpful. You might choose to:

- Set hourly reminders to drink a glass of water.
- Use apps that track your intake and send you notifications.
- Mark your water bottle with time indicators to encourage steady drinking.

### Infuse Flavor into Your Water

If plain water feels dull, try infusing it with your favorite fruits, herbs, or vegetables. This not only adds flavor but can also make drinking water feel more enjoyable. Some popular combinations include:

- Lemon and mint
- Cucumber and basil
- Strawberry and kiwi

Experimenting with different flavors can motivate you to drink more water throughout the day.

### Associate Drinking Water with Daily Activities

Creating habits around drinking water can be beneficial. Consider associating your water intake with routine activities. Here are some ideas:

- Drink a glass of water after brushing your teeth.
- Have a glass before each meal.
- Sip water during your breaks.

By linking water drinking with these daily tasks, you create a seamless habit that doesn’t feel forced.

### Monitor Your Urine Color

Your body gives you signals about hydration. One of the most straightforward indicators is urine color. Ideally, your urine should be light yellow. If it’s dark, you may need to increase your water intake. Keeping an eye on this can help you adjust your drinking habits accordingly.

### Eat Water-Rich Foods

Many fruits and vegetables can aid in your hydration. Incorporate these water-rich foods into your diet:

- Watermelon
- Cucumber
- Oranges
- Strawberries
- Celery

Including these items in your meals can contribute to your overall hydration levels.

### Consider Your Activity Level

If you’re engaging in physical activities or spending time in hot weather, your water needs may increase. It’s important to drink extra fluids when exercising or sweating more than usual. Carry extra water and make it a point to hydrate before, during, and after your workouts.

### Lead by Example

If you're in a social setting or have friends and family around, make water drinking a part of your time together. Encourage those around you to hydrate too. Having a buddy system can motivate you both to reach your daily water goals.

By integrating these practical tips, you can easily ensure you're drinking enough water each day. Remember, staying hydrated is key to feeling your best and enjoying optimal health.

### Conclusion

Staying hydrated is essential for your overall health and well-being. Understanding how much water you should be drinking each day is a vital first step. The general guideline of eight 8-ounce glasses, or about 2 liters, serves as a good baseline for many people. However, individual needs can vary greatly based on factors like age, activity level, and climate.

He seemed almost indifferent to me, maybe even annoyed by me until 3 months ago. My team was sharing things they've been working on for the past year, and I decided to be vulnerable and share that I had gone through a divorce. There is a noticeable shift in how Paul acts around me. I noticed, and realized that maybe I was attracted to him. Suddenly Paul and I are talking any chance we get. When talking one on one, we have the most intense eye contact, and it feels like chemistry. He's suddenly awkward around me, meeting me in the lunchroom and asking how I am which he'd NEVER done before. When I enter his shared office he gets a massive smile on his face I'd never seen before. In a virtual team conference he drops a ""you're awesome"" after I agree to do something for our project, again, something he's never done.

I was crushing on him. It felt like he was flirting, a lot, and I felt the chemistry. His awkwardness lead me to think he was nervous to ask me out, so I decided to be bold. I had his personal number, and I sent him a text asking if he'd like to go for coffee. He responds professionally and ends with ""if you're asking on a personal level, I'm married"".

He doesn't wear a wedding band, never drops a ""we"" or mentions a spouse. I feel Really stupid. Was I making things up? Should I have kept it at a work flirt? He's been okay about it since, we can still talk and work together without much awkwardness. But did I make this all up?",1,1734499452.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

I have a Lelit Bianca V3 and noticed an issue with the hot water spout. Since I started using it, the water from the spout has a light brown coffee tinge, even though I’m only drawing hot water. It makes the hot water unusable, especially for tea or other drinks.

Here’s some additional info:

	•	Water Source: I’m using filtered water, so the issue shouldn’t be related to hard water or impurities.

	•	Group Head Use: The coffee from the group head itself tastes fine.

	•	Cleaning Done: I’ve flushed the machine a few times with chemical cleaner and run some water through the spout, but the tinge persists. I haven’t descaled. 

I’m wondering:

	1.	Could this be residual oils or coffee grounds contaminating the steam/hot water path? And if so how do I clean the hot water path?

	2.	Is there a cleaning or maintenance step I might have missed?

	3.	Should I disassemble anything to check for blockages or contamination?

Any suggestions or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated!

Tonight I (19F) was sitting in my room and my father came in angry because he said my younger sister (13f) was crying to my mom telling her that she thinks I hate her, that I never spend enough time with her, I treat her differently then our other younger sibling, he kept going and finished by saying, ""its things like this that make someone un alive themselves, and that I should think about that"". I was shocked and honestly angry all I said was ok, because why wouldn't they talk to me instead of just get mad about how she feels. I understand maybe she does fell that way, but even if she does I think it was an over step to use un alive as a way to make me think about my actions when that's not what my sister expressed so it was just away to make me fell bad. For some background, we used to have a rocky relationship when I was younger 14ish because a lot of stuff from my childhood caught up with me, like not feeling like enough. My parents wanted a boy and expressed this and had one after me but he passed tragically a month after birth, then my parents adopted three boys older than me because they wanted a boy so badly, the younger sister was then born as I saw her as just another reason I was not good enough. However I got help for my hurt towards them and have worked through this years ago, so I am not sure how relevant this is other than maybe that's what my parents thought of when she brought this up, but she never new about this cause it was worked out by the time she was old enough understand. Well leading up to this my Mother has expressed since I moved back in to do college from their house that she wished I did more with sister (f13) so I have tried, I take her to dance if I am not working and bring her coffee or tea, I take her thrifting if I have time, Ill take her to the store if I am going and don't have work after which is pretty rare, and I do her hair and make up if she wants when she's hanging out with friends. I thought these small things would be enough to make her happy in our relationship. Me and my sister are extremely close due to the death of our sibling and the crazy adoption to make us depend on each other. I think my parents just assume that is how all sister are but we were just abnormally close. To add to this I am a Junior in college and work 3-4 days a week so I really do not have spare time. So my question is should I be spending more time with her, and was this a normal expectation of me and im the ass whole for not doing more. Or is it normal for us not to be close because of out age difference? Finally my question is even if I am in the wrong it was crazy for my dad to use un aliving to make me think about my actions. If I am completely in wrong please let me know because I want to talk to my parents but I need to know other peoples thoughts. Thanks in advance for anyones response because it is appreciated.

I never mess up at work. I don't give them any ammunition. But things never change. If anything, the bullies seem to hate me even more. 

Their behavior (and their extreme hatred) towards me feels so irrational. 

Its so maddening feeling this helpless. I don't know if it's just pure jealousy. Because often times it feels like the animosity is instant. Like, these people decide they dislike me from day ONE. And then everything I do is viewed through a negative lens. 

Seriously, I brought coffee and donuts for them. I stayed late to finish extra work. I bought supplies for the office. Yet their animosity towards me only increased 100 times. And their smear campaigns became more aggressive. 

It's insane. How do you even twist my behavior into something negative??? Like what must they even complain about at this point. 

The worst part is how other people just blindly join the hate campaign. As if I'm not a human being with feelings. I wish this didn't hurt so badly. This feels like emotional abuse at this point.

Like the title says the statue is changing. I've been keeping a journal. I won't go into too much detail here, I'll let my journal tell what happened. I don't care who thinks I'm crazy anymore. 

—————————————————————————

December 9

I don't know how to start this. I don't even know if I believe my own eyes. I noticed it the other day maybe Wednesday or Thursday. I can't remember which, but I almost didn't see it. Outside of my apartment in the courtyard there's this statue of some man. He has some significance to this town, but I don't remember. I just moved here last month and I read the plaque at the base of the statue the day I moved in. I can't remember what it said at all though. One of the founders or some mayor maybe? I DO remember what the statue looked like: it was tall about 15 - 18 feet, it had that aged bronze or brass color with the deep browns that eased into the blackened parts of the metal, the man himself was older maybe early to mid-fifties, he wore a suit without a tie, and lastly his arms were holding his jacket just below the lapels. That last part is the most important because the other day his arms were in a different spot. They had both moved up to just below the collar.

When I walked by that day, I got a sense I was being watched from above. I shot my eyes up to the windows in my building, but most of the curtains were drawn and the lights were off in the open ones. Then I looked towards the statue. I pass by it everyday going to and from wherever; work mostly. Something struck me as being off this time. I first thought that the shadows were off or the morning winter sun was hitting it differently than I was used to. I walked on not giving it too much thought. That evening, as I was coming home and dusk had already given way to night, the spotlight that illuminated the statue from below confirmed my unease from earlier. His arms, I thought to myself, his arms weren't like that before. I immediately shook the feeling away. *Get it together, Jen. You're just tired.* That's how felt the next day, and by the third I had forgotten about the strange feeling I got from the statue. Or, at least, nearly forgotten. 

Today, it changed again. I shrugged it off before, but now I know for sure that I was right. Rather than both hands firmly grasping the lapels just below the collar of the shirt, the left hand held the lapel while the right hand was frozen mid-wave by his head. I must have stared at it for three minutes before stopping someone walking through the courtyard. ""Excuse me,"" I said, ""you live in this building, too, don't you?"" The man looked a little annoyed at first but stopped and said, ""yes, I do."" I gestured to the statue. ""Does anything seem off about the statue today?"" His look turned from annoyance to puzzled. He looked up, ""this old thing? Still looks the same to me. Smug face and all."" He said the last part as he continued his walk. ""Okay, thanks,"" I said after him. I shook my head and went to work. When I got home today, I started writing this journal. Just so I can keep track of it and organize my thoughts. Who knows, maybe it will never happen again. 

December 11

Well, it moved again. I feel like my eyes are playing tricks on me. I got up and went to work, but I was running late this morning so I sprinted straight by without thinking. When I got home I remembered to check on the statue's position after I got the feeling of being watched again. His head was tilted down. Instead of looking straight ahead like he had been, he now looked down at the people below him. At this point I don't know how I should feel about it. I know I'm not crazy, I've noticed three different poses it's taken. I don't know if I should contact the authorities or not. What would they say? What would they do? 

As I stood there studying the statue again, I asked a woman as she passed by, ""I'm sorry, ma'am, have you got a moment?"" She turned towards me and said, ""yes?"" The word formed a cloud of frost in front of her face. ""I'm sorry,"" I apologized again, ""what do you know about the statue here?"" She turned her head towards it then back. ""Not much more than what's written on the plaque,"" she said pointing to the base. ""And does it seem strange to you?"" I looked at her hoping for a satisfying answer. ""Well,"" she said, ""I always thought it was creepy how it stared down at people. Ever since I moved here, I was felt like I was being watched by it."" Then I asked, ""and how long have you lived here?"" She looked up in contemplation, ""let's see, it'll be six years in February."" I stood there shocked, snow had started to gently fall. *Six years?* The statue looked different not two days ago... Right? That's what I wrote down. What is going on? 

I thanked her and we parted ways. I'm sitting on the window nook as I write this down. I keep looking down at that statue. I started to wonder if it felt my eyes like how I felt it's on me. I'm tired now. 

December 12

The gentle snow that started last night must have taken a rapid turn into blizzard territory. It is currently 5:43 a.m. and the weather channel says the snow has reached four and a half feet. It is still coming down pretty hard still but not as hard as it must have last night. I looked out the window and saw nothing. Between the dark morning and heavy cloud coverage there wasn't any way to see the statue. After calling my boss and confirming we wouldn't be going in today, I started coffee maker and turned on my computer. If I was going to be up this early I might as well get some work done. Thankfully my job didn't actually require me to clock in at the office. I could do that from anywhere. After pouring a mug, I sat down and got to work.

Next thing I know it's 2:54 p.m. I didn't even eat. The snow officially stopped an hour ago, but the clouds still grey out the sun's rays. As I walked towards the window a deep sense of dread washed over my body. I shivered the feeling away; still I hesitated to look out of the window. I had every right to be creeped out. *No, there's no way that's possible.* The statue was now looking up at my window, hand still raised, waving. I threw the curtains closed and started backing up. ""No. No way. It's just not possible,"" I spoke out loud this time. I almost tripped over my coffee table. I felt like my head was swimming. I sat on the edge of table for a long time waiting for the explanation to make itself known. After a few minutes I found myself standing and staring back out the window. *The snow.* I just noticed there wasn't a flake of snow anywhere on statue. Not even the concrete base, which was about four foot tall.
I feel like it's targeting me now. 

December 13

I barely got any sleep at all last night. My dreams were filled with a silent and giant adversary that got closer if I blinked or looked away for a millisecond. 

The city must have cleared paths last night. I went to the window and saw the snow was pushed away in the roads and even the courtyard. On my walk to work I ran into the same woman from the other day. She smiled as we were approaching each other and I nodded and smiled back. I looked at the statue; it wasn't even trying to be subtle anymore. It was saluting and looking straight ahead. It was dressed in military garb. My dad was a captain in the Air Force and the statue's outfit looked identical.

I was so confused. How was the statue moving? Why doesn't anyone else notice the changes? Why me? I called out of work, feigning pneumonia and headed back inside. 

December 14

I decided to call the authorities on my walk home this evening. The statue (base and all) had moved from the center of the courtyard to directly under my window this window.

""Maybrook Police Department,"" the man said. ""Hi, my name Jennifer Winslet. I live in the Maybrook Hills Building on 5th Avenue. This is going to sound crazy..."" I hesitated for a moment. ""Go on, Miss Winslet,"" the operator coaxed. ""I doubt we haven't heard it before."" *Wanna bet?* ""Well, you see sir, the statue outside the building... keeps moving,"" I said the last part fast. ""I'm sorry, ma'am. You said the statue is moving?"" I heard the disbelief. ""Yes, sir,"" I responded. ""Moving how,"" he asked, ""like by vandals?"" 

""More like on its own. Changing poses and positions in the courtyard,"" I answered followed by a pause that echoed throughout history but was over in a second. ""Miss Winslet, are you on any medication?"" He doesn't believe me. Of course he doesn't. ""No, I'm not,"" I said. ""Using any illicit substances, such as; heroin or methamphetamine?"" I sighed heavy, ""no, I'm not. And I'm not drunk either. I know how it sounds. I-"" He cut me off. ""Miss Winslet, if it will make you feel better we'll send over a couple of officers to check it out. Sound good?"" I thanked him and hung up the phone.

I sat by the window and waited for them to pull up. To my surprise, they showed up and got out of the cruiser. I rushed down to meet them at the base. ""Miss Winslet?"" The younger of the two asked as I running over to them. ""Yes, officer, I was afraid you wouldn't show."" The older one grunted, ""just be thankful it's a slow night."" They looked the statue over haphazardly then they looked back at me. ""Well, ma'am, in my opinion: it's a statue,"" the young one chided. The older one elbowed him. ""What Sargent Burns means is that this is how the statue has always looked since it was built in the '40s. Not an inch out of place."" I thanked them even though I was unsatisfied with their response. I went back to my apartment defeated. 

—————————————————————————

After I that I went to bed. As I lay there I decided I would transcribe and post it here to see if anyone had any suggestions. I thought I'd be posting this tomorrow, but I was woken up by a large rumbling that shook the whole building. I got up and checked the hallway, but no one else seemed to notice. Then as I turned around, my eyes caught an unfamiliar glint of moonlight through the window. I slowly made my way over to my laptop. That's where I am now. Stuck in my stupid apartment with that thing outside my window. He's grin has extended to an unnatural and demented smile. ",10,1734498667.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Ever found yourself hunched over your desk, feeling like Quasimodo after a long day of work? I sure have. That's why I decided to dive deep into the world of ergonomic desks, and boy, did I stumble upon a gem! Eureka ergonomic desks have been making waves, but can they live up to the hype? Let's find out in this in-depth, no-holds-barred review!
  
  
## The Eureka Ergonomic Desk: A Symphony of Wood and Steel

When I first laid eyes on the Eureka ergonomic desk, I couldn't help but be mesmerized by the dance of wood and steel. Seriously, it was like a Shakespearean play of materials coming together in perfect harmony. The sturdy design, crafted primarily from high-quality oak or walnut, gives off this warm, inviting vibe that says, “Hey, you’re welcome here for those long hours of working or gaming.”

The steel frame isn’t just for looks; it’s like the bouncer of the desk world, ensuring everything stays stable no matter how animated your hand gestures get during a video call (we all have those moments, right?). And speaking of stability, this desk can handle quite a bit of weight without so much as a wobble. It’s sturdy enough to hold my enormous coffee mug alongside my laptop, multiple notebooks, and even an occasional snack explosion—because who doesn’t need a chocolate bar when brainstorming?

But what truly sets this desk apart is its unique adjustable height feature. You can easily shift from sitting to standing in mere seconds. It’s like having a dance partner that knows exactly when to twirl you around! And the smooth finishing on the surfaces doesn’t just help with aesthetics; it makes for easy cleaning too. So, less time scrubbing and more time creating—talk about a win-win!

## Ergo-Alchemy: Eureka's Magic Formula for Comfort

When it comes to comfort in our workspaces, the Eureka ergonomic desk is practically a wizard. You might think, ""It’s just a desk, right?"" but oh boy, it’s like having a personal assistant who tugs at your chair and says, “Hey, let’s sit right, shall we?” One of the coolest things about these desks is the adjustable height feature. Seriously, when I first tried it, I felt like I was in a sci-fi movie. One minute, I’m sitting down like I’m ready for a marathon of my favorite show, and the next, I’m standing and feeling ready to conquer the world. No more back pain or stiff necks for me!

Also, there’s this handy keyboard tray. It’s like finding a treasure chest you didn’t know you needed. With my hands at the right level, typing feels more fluid, and I can focus on crushing deadlines instead of adjusting my posture. 

Now, let’s not forget about cable management—because chaos isn't comfy. My wires used to look like spaghetti threw a party under my desk. But with the smart design of cable management, I can actually see the floor now. Imagine that! Keeping a tidy workspace not only feels good but also helps keep our minds clear. A healthier workspace isn’t just a dream; it’s a reality waiting for us to grab it.

## Assembly Required? A Journey Through the Instruction Manual

Assembling the Eureka ergonomic desk felt like embarking on a quest, one that would make Frodo's journey to Mordor seem like a walk in the park. Armed with my faithful screwdriver and a slightly questionable sense of direction, I opened the box, which, let me tell you, was quite the sight! Parts, screws, and Allen wrenches tumbled out like they were trying to escape. Seriously, when I opened it, I half expected a tiny instruction manual to roll out like an ancient scroll, saying, ""Good luck, brave soul.""

Now, the instruction manual was a curious creature. It was like reading a map for a treasure hunt where the treasure was a desk, and the map was written in hieroglyphics! I flipped the manual over and squinted at the diagrams, which looked like something out of an abstract art exhibition. “Step one: attach leg A to panel B using connector C.” Great, but which leg was leg A? Was I building a desk or a wizard’s cauldron?

After a few moments of confusion (and a quick break to eat a snack—I needed fuel), I finally located the pieces. Picture this: I'm twisting screws and balancing things like a circus performer. Just as I was about to declare myself a modern-day architect, I put the top on upside down. Oops! Thankfully, the manual, with its perplexing drawings, guided me back. Eventually, after negotiating with stubborn screws and overcoming setbacks, the desk stood tall, a triumphant structure reminding me of a rollercoaster ride: thrilling, slightly messy, but utterly worth it.

## The Eureka Ergonomic Desk: A Day in the Life

Picture this: I’m sipping my first cup of coffee, the device I call my “Eureka ergonomic desk” gleaming in the early morning light like a knight ready for battle. I plop down, and let me tell you, the moment I sit, the chair hugs me like an old friend. Seriously, it’s like this desk was built for my butt. 

As I start working, my fingers dance across the keyboard, and I appreciate how the desk’s surface gives me just the right resistance—no slipping, no sliding around. I dive into emails, sending witty replies that probably made my colleagues chuckle. The adjustable height is a game-changer, too; I can go from sitting to standing like a pro. By noon, I’m mixing it up—standing to stretch out my back and flaunting my ‘I mean business’ aura. 

When afternoon rolls around, I switch gears and plunge into a gaming marathon. I crank up my favorite tunes, and it’s time to unleash my inner warrior. The desk holds my snacks without a fuss (major bonus points!), and the integrated cable management helps me avoid turning into a human spaghetti monster with my wires. 

As the sun sets and the night creeps in, I transition into streaming mode. The desk remains my steadfast companion as I balance laptops, cameras, and a mountain of snacks. It’s a typical day transformed thanks to my trusty ergonomic desk—it makes even the wildest days feel comfortable and, dare I say, a little magical.

## Eureka Ergonomic Desk: The Test of Time

Eureka ergonomic desks have this magical way of making you believe they can withstand the test of time, but how do they hold up after extended use? Let me tell you about my own experience, which has been quite an adventure. I got my desk around two years ago, and honestly, at first, I was thrilled. The smooth finish, the way the adjustable height seemed to fit perfectly—like when you find that one pair of shoes that just feel like they were made for you. However, after all those late-night gaming sessions and the dozen coffee spills (my fault, not the desk's!), I started noticing some wear and tear.

The surface? Still looking good, which is quite a feat considering my tendency to pile on snacks while binge-watching shows. But the legs? Well, they developed a few scratches from my not-so-gentle re-positioning whenever I felt a little too inspired (or maybe just a little too lazy to get up). I compared this to a friend’s desk, which, to be honest, looked like it had been through a minor war. It had scratches and wobbliness that made it feel more like a seesaw than a workspace.

In summary, while these desks come with a sturdy reputation, they do show signs of battle after a couple of years. So, be ready for some touch-ups and a few character marks—just like us, right?

## The Eureka Ergonomic Desk: Worth Its Weight in Gold?

When it comes to ergonomic desks, the big question is always: ""Is it worth it?"" I mean, have you ever stared at a price tag and thought you might need a second mortgage? I remember my buddy, Dave, who initially balked at the price of his new desk like he was staring at a diamond-encrusted toilet. But let’s break it down. 

The Eureka ergonomic desks are priced competitively within the market. You might find some budget options out there, but trust me, you get what you pay for—like the difference between a gourmet burger and one from that questionable food truck down the street. These desks often come with solid build quality, featuring materials that don’t feel like they’ll buckle at the first sign of a sneeze. 

Plus, they boast features that just scream “Hey, I care about your back!” Things like adjustable heights, cable management systems, and space for all your superhero figurines are pretty standard. And let’s not forget about the warranty. A good warranty is like a safety net at a circus; it’s nice to know it’s there in case you take a dive while assembling.

So, are they worth their weight in gold? If you consider the long-term benefits of a healthy workspace, the answer is likely a resounding yes.

## Conclusions
  
  
After weeks of testing, I can confidently say that the Eureka ergonomic desk is more than just a pretty face. It's a powerhouse of comfort, durability, and style. But don't just take my word for it – give it a try and feel the Eureka difference for yourself! Your back will thank you, and so will your productivity.

1hgued0,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1hgued0/seeking_feedback_attempted_ethiopian_light_roast/,[Seeking Feedback] Attempted Ethiopian Light Roast,"# Roast

I roasted[ this washed Ethiopian coffee ](https://www.sweetmarias.com/ethiopia-agaro-duromina-8060.html)5 days ago, aiming for a light roast. Roasted on an SR800 Freshroast with extension tube and thermocouples. BT thermocouple probe is directly in the bean mass. ET thermocouple is \~300 mm from the top of the chaff lid.

Movement of the beans looked good during the roast, and I was overall happy with how it looked and smelled through the process. I kept power at 4 or 5 (I can't remember) the whole way, and brought the fan down from 9 to 1.

# Thoughts on Results

Cupping and pourover yield a not-so-flavorful coffee and the espresso is sour.

I am not getting the floral/fruit scents or flavors that the description mentions and that I usually sense from professionally roasted Ethiopian coffees. This is maybe my 10th roast overall.

I notice that some of the beans look a little bit mottled in color and the roast could be more even. They are hard to chew.

I am thinking that maybe at a certain point, increasing power would be a good idea once the fan is brought down to 4 so that the beans keep moving and can be roasted more evenly.

Any feedback or tips would be appreciated! Thanks

Throwaway, fake names

I (31M) have split custody of my son, Marcus (12M) with my ex, Lena (30F). Lena and I split up shortly after he was born, and stayed friends, but have been less communicative since she married Erik (42M) four years ago. We have had disagreements–I don't approve of certain things they've been doing and they think I spoil him–but until recently we managed to keep things civil.

Marcus is a great kid and I love him. He's smart, funny, and caring, and he's taught me so much about being a human. Having him saved my life and changed it for the better. He's also more or less my only family, so I really treasure him and our time together. Recently he's gotten chubby and depressed, which I only mention because it's relevant.

I was concerned over my son gaining weight but I didn't want to do much other than making sure we eat healthy. He's still active in sports, which I encourage, and a lot will change with puberty. His mom and stepdad are upset though, and I now know that they had Marcus on a restricted diet and are putting a lot of pressure on him to lose weight. At first it didn't seem like much but it became more unreasonable e.g. before this incident, I got in trouble with Erik for buying Marcus a size up in clothes, since he thought that he should trim down to fit his old ones better. I told him that I wasn't going to apologise for giving my son pants, he never responded.

Last week, when I came to pick him up, Marcus was still packing his bag. Lena invited me inside for coffee and we were making small talk when I heard shouting. Apparently Marcus had been hiding snacks in his room. Erik found candy bars in his overnight bag (which they no longer allow in the house), and pulled them out to show to us as evidence. I got upset when he called Marcus names and told him he ""wouldn't be fat if he weren't so greedy"", and told him to treat my son with respect.

Marcus went to the car, and things devolved. I said the thing in the title, called him a bully, and a lot of expletives got thrown around. I didn't hear from Lena until later when she texted to tell me that she was furious with me. I was still reeling from everything so the conversation is a blur. I tried to tell her I was sorry, but that I couldn't understand why she would allow him to treat Marcus that way. She told me that while was ""a bit much"", Marcus broke their rules and Erik was right that he should lose weight. She also told me that I don't know anything about the ""disrespect"" Marcus gives them, that I only experience the ""fun parts of being a parent"", and accused me of encouraging bad behaviour that she has to deal with.

I had a talk with Marcus and told him I love him and he has nothing to be ashamed of. He seems better, but I'm not looking forward to taking him back to his mom's home. I know I made things worse and I should have removed myself from the situation, but I wouldn't feel right if I didn't at least stand up for my son. AITA?

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

*Custody agreement:*

>**OOP:** Custody is 50-50, EOW, \[every other week\] and it's more even now, but my ex has taken him on several times when work or school got out of hand for me so he's been with her more on average. I owe her for that and I want to make it up to her but I need to reflect on and talk to her about the idea that I'm the fun parent and how I can fix that.  
That being said, it's kind of a secondary concern rn considering what's going on with my kid. I didn't think it was that weird and probably underestimated the issue based on my judgement of my child's weight changes being normal, but I should have picked up on other red flags. If this is what's happening in front of me, I fear it's very likely much worse and just making my home a safe space for my kid isn't enough. What I'm getting from this situation is that I really need to talk to a bunch of professionals.

Commenter: NTA. Your comment about being in trouble with Erik concerned me deeply. You are Marcus’ father, not Erik. It is Erik who should be in trouble with you for daring to criticize buying larger clothes for Marcus. I doubt screaming will do any good, Erik sounds like a bully. Suggest you speak with an attorney and put Erik in his place.

>**OOP:** Honestly I've been feeling like I live in the twilight zone since then, it was so bizarre and insane I started wondering if I was crazy.

Commenter: ESH. Has your ex taken your son to the doctor? Is she following medical advice on weight loss? Did you ask her about any of that?

I recommend that you and your ex--and not her husband--sit down in a neutral place when neither of you are angry and discuss what's *best for your son*. Everyone needs to drop the ego and concentrate on what's best for Marcus. Does he need to modify his diet? Be more active? Is there something going on medically?

Figure it out. If he does need to lose weight, then work with a dietician who works with pre-pubescent kids. Restricting food to the point that he's hiding it is not healthy.

>**OOP**: Don't know if I should have included this in the post, but to the best of my knowledge and based on the conversations I've had with Marcus since, this doesn't seem to be based on any actual medical advice or have entailed any visits to a doctor. From what I've gathered it's just very broad, drastic restriction of his food intake which is making things worse. That being said, I need to hear more from my son and my ex before I come to any conclusions. This is also wildly out of character for her, I've never seen her be cruel to anyone, especially not our son, and I'm worried for her too.  
I definitely want to take him to a doctor myself and get some expert advice/counselling on several fronts, this is a big wake up call that I've horribly underestimated how bad things are. I didn't think it was anywhere near enough to justify this kind of action but regardless of whether there's something physically wrong like a thyroid problem, this is a deeply unhealthy situation for my child and I need to make it right.

Commenter: A lot of kids, especially boys will chunk up before they shoot up. Unless a doctor has a concern, it shouldn’t be an issue. They should be seeking medical advice before putting a child on a diet. \[...\] NTA

>**OOP:** I fully agree with this and I think this is abusive/a huge overreaction to a weight change that could result in a serious vicious spiral, but I really do think I was wrong to handle it the way I did. Standing up for my son is one thing, I needed to shut that down, and to make some serious long term changes to help him with his living situation, but letting that spiral into an out of control fight with another adult who is still very much one of his guardians isn't going to help him.

Commenter: I think they all suck because they could put their differences aside and talk about the situation in the best interest of the kid instead of yelling at each other and having two different parenting styles.

>**OOP:** After reading through this I definitely fucked up that interaction, standing up for my kid is one thing but not removing myself from the situation before it escalated and letting it devolve like that is another and it doesn't help my son. I'm definitely a lot more upset at his stepdad than I realized and it's been building for a while.  
I do think my son's right ahead of a growth spurt/that it's not an abnormal or concerning amount of weight and that's why I wasn't worried, but I need to talk more to my ex. I care about her and I very much want to have a discussion with her but navigating her husband is going to be difficult; it's hard for me not to see his behaviour as really cruel and bizarre. Either way, I have a lot of work to do.

*Do you discipline him at all?*

>**OOP:** re: discipline, I honestly don't know what I'd ""discipline"" him for. I don't want to be a dad who considers my child above all wrongdoing, and I do want to hold high standards for my kid and teach him the right values. I've been questioning how well I do that after what my ex said, but he's really well behaved with me and makes a point to help care for our home and make my life easier when he's in my custody, so I haven't seen it personally. If he's acting up with his mom or anyone else I do want to intervene and tell him that it's not okay to be disrespectful, but this is the first time she's complained about him to me, and in light of his stepdad being like this, I can't help but think that if he's acting out with them, it's not actually because of anything wrong with him.

**Mini Update in** [Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hajzvj/comment/m19osf4/)**: 2 hours later**

Hi all,

This is a lot of responses very fast and I thank you for the support, suggestions, and the brutal honesty. I do think I was wrong to escalate the situation and not remove myself sooner. There's a lot of things I need to do as a father, and I value all of your feedback.

I do want to respond to something; I've had a few people in the comments tell me that Erik IS my son's other dad by virtue of being in that house and married to my ex, but I guess my problem is that I don't think he should be. I would be more than happy to welcome another parental figure in my kid's life, I don't think I have a monopoly on being Dad or anything, but as it stands, my child hates and fears him and I do not think anyone who does that to my child deserves to call themselves his parent. I felt the same way about my bio parents, and I refuse to acknowledge them as my family, so I guess that's where that comment about him not being my son's dad came from. That being said, I know I'm in the wrong for shouting at him out of anger instead of trying to be the adult and this does nothing to help my son.

I also don't want anyone blaming ANY of this on my son or suggesting that he's being a dick to his mom and stepdad; he's twelve and children act out of distress when adults treat them poorly or fail them, myself included. He's the only person in this situation who's not at fault.

I will keep trying to talk to my ex, get counselling for my son, and seek out legal advice.

*OOP Clarifies:*

Commenter: If you're in Europe/UK, generally they take children's rights more seriously than in the USA.

>**OOP:** I am from Europe, but I'm not optimistic. I know it's a different time but I grew up in a truly terrible home and was failed pretty badly by the system, even being from one of the ""best"" countries for children's rights. If I want things to be right for my son I need to take care of it myself.

**Update (Same Post): December 11, 2024 (2 days later)**

UPDATE: Thanks again for your responses. I am in touch with social services and filed for emergency custody since I don’t see a non-legal way forward.

Many pointed out the way my Lena and Erik treat my son would push him towards disordered eating or could be malnutrition. Unfortunately it seems be some degree of both. I learned more re: what they let Marcus eat (900-1000 cal/day vs recommended 2500 for active preteens) which pushed him to sneak food. The humiliation is also constant behind closed doors. I fear there’s more he’s afraid to tell me. He's physically okay (according to paediatrician) but hurt. I'm trying to make sure he knows he has nothing to be ashamed of, and that the person who should be ashamed is the one who did this.

Re: other things in my ex’s house, Erik apparently often starts nasty fights with Marcus. He has also said some pretty demeaning/disturbing things about my background, which is unsurprising. His mom gets shouted down when she tries to defend him. She bothsides the situation afterwards, holding husband and child equally responsible.

Lena reached out to apologise. She said that she knows Erik was wrong and promised to try and talk sense to him. I told her this wasn’t enough and asked why she went along with it. She seemed to wake up when I told her that they seriously hurt Marcus, and agreed that their behaviour was unacceptable, but begged me to let her try and fix it. She seemed really tired and unwell and completely different from my former friend. I asked if she feels safe at home, she wouldn’t give me a straight answer but promised that she’s not physically unsafe and will seek help if needed.

I feel for her but no longer trust her. I recorded the call just in case (we’re in a one party consent country) and will keep gathering evidence.

Honestly I’m scared, I was failed badly by social services/courts as a kid so I don’t have faith in them. It's also complicated because Lena and I never married: I’m a legal guardian, but we had Marcus as teens with no support and there's a complex history. I’m saving details for the lawyer to get advice specific to my situation, but I’m not letting Erik near my son

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: NTA. Something is going on in that house, and it isn't good for your son. If he does have an eating disorder, then it could have developed by whatever is happening in that house. FYI: it is never about food. My question is, why did your son not tell you this was happening. More to the point: what other weird stuff is occurring? Erik should not be trying to parent your son. It sounds like he bullies your boy and the child's mother. His call to you about buying your kid pants was a weird dominance flex against you. Basically, Erik has no respect for any of you, and your son is suffering due to it. I wonder why his mother can't see that. What has changed over the last 4 years?

>**OOP:** It's a lot uglier than what I've written honestly, there's so many details and minor escalations over the years that I'm putting together in my head. From what my son has told me, the weight shaming is much worse in that house, like some truly disgusting comments about his body that make what I witnessed look mild by comparison. I understand why he's scared or embarrassed to talk about it, he was already tearing up when he admitted that to me and it's hard for children to discuss that kind of humiliation.  
re: the dominance flex, I've always been aware that Erik looks down on me, though he never said it to my face until our fight. I work a blue collar job, didn't go to school, and had my kid at 18, and he thinks that this makes him more responsible or fit to parent than I am. There's other elements to it, and TIL he's called me a *lot* of things in front of my son and ex, but that's how he saw me from the start and it's only gone downhill from there.

Commenter: I think lots of people would react the same way, or more explosively, to someone being abusive to their child. \[...\] I also don't think someone like Erik, a grown man who starves a child (based on your update on Marcus' caloric intake recently, he is actually being starved) and then screams at them and calls them names is necessarily the kind of person who would be receptive to a calm and rational explanation of why that is inappropriate...

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/a0BYzNDLJw)  **Sept 7, 2019**

My mom died when I was 6, and my dad remarried when I was 9, the women he married had a daughter one year younger than me so she was 8. At first I loved having a new ""mom"" she wasn't the best and will never replace my real mom but I appreciate her trying to be there for me and I am pretty close with her and my dad. At first I loved having a ""sister"" and we got along great, I loved having a play mate during vacations and always having a player 2.

The problems really started to amp up when I was 13 and she was 12, it seemed like no matter what I did went unpunished in her eyes and she had to mock me constantly. Being a hot headed 13 year old usually meant id retaliate and we would have those long screaming matches till either of our parents told us to knock it off or they would send up to different parts of the house to cool off.

I also started playing football in high school and my problem was that I was constantly getting injured. In 8 years (11-18) I broke my arm, pinky, wrist, got 2 concussions, tore my ACL, sprained my MCL and dislocated my shoulder. On top of all that I was kinda chubby, I don't wanna say I was fat (I was about 180-210 from the ages of 14-18 at 6'2). She used to make fun of me for my injuries and my weight which were very touchy subjects for me her favorite insult was ""you fat cripple loser!"" or ""maybe if you lost some weight you wouldn't get injured so often."" Back then those insults really pissed me off but I kept trying to be the ""older brother"" and just told her to shut up, fight back or storm off.

She also loved to embarrass me when friends were over by bringing up dumb stuff I did when I was like 9 or 10 (my friends are great people but we tease each other a lot and would usually remember anything embarrassing we did and bring it up later). So whatever she said to them would always get back. I did talk with her if she could just shut up when I have my friends over, and she basically told me to F off and that its her house too. At this point in my life (16yo) I am super pissed at how shitty she has treated me over the years, I know I caused some if and usually fought back when she got snippy and bratty at me but to me she started more fights than I did.  

I did try to talk to my dad and step mom about the way me and her treat each other and they basically said its normal ""sibling rivalry"". Her antics got a lot worse and her words got more and more mean filled and vile, which meant I would retaliate with just as mean and vile filled insults.

I will not sit here and say I wasn't just as mean to her as she was to me.  I used to bully her relentlessly for these hair buns she would wear from 13-14 (if you want a picture just look up the buns leah wore from star wars).  I also told her plenty of times that I hate her and don't consider her family, (I have apologized so much for those 2 cause I do feel bad, even tho she hasn't apologized I know she feels bad too).  I bet there were some other moments but they didn't happen to me so I probably forgot them.

I moved out when I was 18 without ever sending her a text message goodbye or even telling her I was moving out. the past 5 years of unpleasantness between us made me happy that I didn't have to see her. A year later she moves out and I still resented her for how we treated each other. We go almost 2 years without speaking other than on holidays and thats really only dry stuff nothing big. I am now 21 and she's 20 and I got a text the other night asking why we aren't close like we were when we were kids. I basically said I don't care to get along with you or get close because of how we treated each other as kids. She told me to grow up and not even an hour later I get a call from my dad asking why I have so much hate for my ""sister"" years since we have lived together. I told him ill be cordial and won't cut her out of my life but I don't need or want to be close with her.

How do I go about telling her that I don't want us to be close YET, until WE both want to be close.  But leaving the door open for her not to resent me, and we can still love each other?

TL;DR:Me and my sister treated each other terribly growing up and now I don't really care to be close with her.

Edit: I would like to point out that I was just as mean to my step sister, I don’t have examples cause it’s been 5 years and didn’t stick with me like hers did but our fighting growing up did go both ways.

Edit 2:Some people have said that I shouldn't cut her out of my life, and I agree with that.  I love her and want to be there for her but I don't LIKE her enough to be close with her.

Edit 3: I added more to the story of how I was shitty to her too

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/SMJz73dGSd)  **Sept 30, 2019**

After our text convo that led to my dad calling me asking whats wrong between us I texted her about a meet up at my place.  This was the first time we actually met/hung out outside of a family gathering.  Before she came over that realization gave me a new look on our relationship.  The whole sit down went well, we actually got along and there wasn't any name calling or anything ""mean"", we talked about how we treated each other and this was the first time I've ever heard her apologize for how she treated me growing up and I did the same.  We talked about how the text convo went, and I came to the conclusion that I still had the old image of how she was when I last saw her at 17 and was using that to picture her now.  She still kinda acts the same (kinda moody but can hold it in so much better now) but its a lot better.  We talked it out and spent about half the day together just hanging out and I will admit I enjoyed it.  I don't think we will be super duper close but its a step in the right direction and there isn't a wall of tension between us anymore.

Thank you all for the advice and comments it really came in handy and I appreciate it!

TL;DR: Me and my sister talked it out and it went pretty well.

So literally all that happens is he lets rich people who can't drink coffee experience it while he rakes in the profits, and the MC is just okay with it. Like ""Oh what a noble thing you're doing.""

1hgu9pb,https://www.reddit.com/r/delusionaldisorder/comments/1hgu9pb/i_need_support/,I need support,"For about the past 1-1.5 years, I have been having a delusion that people cough to condition me (like a form of classical behavioral conditioning). 

It started when I noticed one of my coworkers coughed every time the printer went off. And I slowly started getting more uncomfortable and pay more attention to this thought that people were trying to condition me. It got to the point that I would have a physical reaction whenever the printer went off or somebody coughed, and if I was holding a cup of coffee, I had to be careful not to flinch too much as not to spill it. Or my body would just get really hot. - As time has passed, I’ve now started to carry this delusion into other areas of my life, like around family, friends, roommates, and even with my therapist. Of which, my therapist says that this is/these are stress induced delusions. 

I’ve brought this up with people I really trust: like a friend and my parents. and they try to reassure me that it’s all in my head. But tonight I brought it up with my roommate (someone I barely know) because it was driving me crazy to the point that I felt the need to confront someone outside my tight social circle, by asking “why do you cough every Tuesday night?”. (For context I’ve asked him about his coughs in different scenarios more than once, but this was a weirder way for me to bring it up). And then he responded with “my health is fine and you need to let it go”. 

And that brings me to now. Because after he said that, I felt very disappointed and shameful of myself. His response showed me he had no relative thoughts of what I have been deluding myself over because he thinks it was genuinely something about his health. And he is inadvertently right that I do need to let it go. 

I guess im just looking for advice on what I can do for myself, or just any moral support. I’ve also started to have similar thoughts when people sniffle or hiccup, etc. My therapist says I need medication, but I’ve been on meds all my life for adhd/depression/anxiety/ and epilepsy.

Sometimes you do just need to get it out

Anyway so, I was the usual demeanor probably more nervous because it was just me on staff today this is very uncommon (I usually work with my charismatic friend that carries the social interactions) and so i was left nervous, guarded, anxious, hoping for every interaction to go well and to just get them over with honestly. (Jeez typing that out it sounds so sad… I hate that I do that. I manipulate every moment… that’s what toxic shame causes).

I say “I’m still trying to find a manager just give me one second I’ll be right back. I’m so sorry”
Because it was taking a bit long
He says something along the lines of “ o it’s okay I understand…” and then “relax!”

I thought to myself jeez girl relax people can see that you hate your life and it’s making them uneasy.
Then I thought, why tf is this grown old man telling a young girl to relax? Leave me tf alone. Why does he think that’s his job to say that to me like my life needed his abservation and instruction my sad little existence was just a “relax” to him.

Another thought, you’d think that older people would understand having feelings like I do at my age maybe or just in general and maybe have understanding?
Maybe him saying that was his version of ‘understanding’ but the way I see it is if someone understands they would just not say anything at all and let you be. His actions say he was bothered by me. So it’s not understanding. Maybe I’m wrong but I can’t imagine understanding and sympathizing and then saying “relax”.

Yeah he did say it in a nice way kinda but it also hurt so I got angry but also accepted it.

And then he was gone. The moment ended. I felt relieved.

I also called a woman sir on accident today. That sucked. I felt like such an embarrassing idiot. I wanted to jump out of my body and say chill tf out!

I’m just always hoping every interaction goes well and I’m so nervous. At work

But really… him saying that made me feel similar to the rest of the world yet isolated to the rest of the world. Like he saw some faulty essence in my eyes upon talking to me and had to point it out by saying relax. Him saying that to me was like saying “you’re messed up inherently”
That’s my worst fear. Deep down I do believe and hope that it isn’t true.

I don’t want to keep living each day to day trying to just get through it and hating it. I do enjoy talking to people sometimes. Sometimes. Most of the time I’m just terrified of being disliked.
How sad is that to admit but it’s true.

I’ve tried to really slow down when talking to people and let it come out my true thoughts instead of awkward laughing or whatever. Sometimes I have to even close my eyes for a second to let them come together.

I’ve gotten that weird 😬 kind of face as people are listening like they’re trying to make out what I am trying to say but it’s just so difficult. I hate those people that have made that face.

It’s hard for me to imagine that some people on this planet have never ever felt anything even close to what I have when talking to people or about myself or in my day to day. It’s true thought there are people that haven’t. Some people look at me nd just feel annoyed and think I suck. They think I’m less than them. Is it because I make myself that way?

I ask for a bit of a selfish reason. I’m a writer but I took a year off of writing to work on a lot of emotional/psychic issues I was avoiding and I jsut started to pick it back up again with a short story idea. I was listening to music in shuffle while I was writing and wrote the word “future” and the exact same time the artist sand the word “future” which might be a coincidence, sure, but stuff like that used to happen to me all the time before I hit rock bottom mentally. 

I would always say or think words/phrases at the exact same time they’re said in a song or commercial or something else out of my control and they would make me feel crazy and I wouldn’t know how to explain it to other people. I’m just not sure how I should take it now that they’re happening again. Is it a sign that I’m on the right path or is it a warning that I’m going back down the same road and that maybe I should try something different and forget writing?

Someone that is always there for you, someone that you can rely on, someone that you can pick up the phone at any point and call to tell them about your day or how you’re feeling. 
The honeymoon stage of a relationship is a great time, where you feel like you’re on top of the world together, and that’s where I thought we were at. We had met 4 months ago and very quickly hit it off. Unfortunately for me, and maybe rather naively on my part, was the fact that we met because she had immediately just come out of a 2 year relationship and was looking to branch out and make new friends. I don’t think she intended to meet someone that she would end up getting romantically involved with so soon after a heart wrenching breakup and unfortunately for me, it appears that this all came about too soon and was the sole reason for the ending of ours. 
She had told me that the holidays were difficult for her due to the significance of what her and her ex did in past years. I understood this and told her that I am there for her if she wanted to talk about it, but was also willing to give her space to deal with her emotions. 
Unfortunately this afternoon, after not having spoken for a few days, she and I met up for a coffee and she broke down in tears telling me that she isn’t ready to dive head first into a relationship with me and feels it is unfair to me to keep trying when her head is not in it. I respect her immensely for having the courage to do this, and I thanked her for trying with me for the last couple months, maybe hoping that her emotions and thoughts of her ex would subside, but they did not. Maybe I should have been a little more careful about jumping head first into a serious relationship with a woman fresh out of something serious with someone else, but I think I was blinded by love. 
I myself came out of an intense 3 year relationship a couple years ago and have since been looking for a romantic partner, and have no fear about wearing my heart on my sleeve and telling people this. I can relate to her in a sense that losing your best friend is extremely difficult and requires time to mourn and process the whole situation. 
Regardless, this really hurts deep down and I know that the next few days, weeks and maybe months are going to be rocky and an emotional shitshow. Love is difficult but to experience the highest of highs, we need to endure the lowest of the lows and sadly for me and for her and millions of other people around the world, this is just the situation we find ourselves in at this time. 
Sending my love to everyone out there that has to go through the same shit. It hurts really bad now and it feels like a part of you is missing, but time heals everything, and you will be ok again. ",1,1734497347.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1hgu3oi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDoctorSmeeee/comments/1hgu3oi/nsaid_induced_stomach_ulcer_and_bad_reaction_to/,NSAID induced stomach ulcer and bad reaction to omepazole,"For over two years I was taking high dosages of aspirin mixed with ibeprophen and time to time naproxen mostly daily. The only reason I know what’s going on is because this happened once before with high dosage ibeprohphan daily. But not as long term and no mixture. I had a thought like “I have a stomach ulcer”. I had no idea what a stomach ulcer felt like at the time and no idea that ibeprophen could cause one. Researched, symptoms matched almost completely. Discontinued and within a month or two I was good.
Now today. I was very very sick for a long time. I can’t take tylonal, I have a weird reaction to it and started to get the same reaction to NSAIDs. Something like light sensitivity, severe letheargy, feelings of weakness, depression, nothing seemed real and I was just unwell. I couldn’t think straight I could hardly get up without feeling like I was gonna fall. My eyes got droopy, red, bloodshot. Sinus probs. A lot of probs overall. It felt somewhat like a seizure aura. Or what I’ve come to find out feels like a silent migraine.(I get silent migraines and if I mess up with my Klonipin, seizure auras)
I stopped alll of it and felt way better within three days I mean I felt like I was on earth and like there wasn’t a wall between me and reality or like I was a ghost not there just watching everyone unable to hardly move or talk. 
I’m now afraid that Ive developed anemia from this ulcer. I had no idea I wasn’t suppose to drink coffee and had some major set backs. Hurts so bad in the morning I just start eating bread. I’ve had signs of internal bleeding that come and go and I’m about to make an apt with a doc in a few days. I would now if I could. Also afraid of potential kidney issues.
Skin has been freaking the hell out although it’s not near as bad as it was when I was taking NSAIDs. I’m afraid it may be due to the bleeding because I’m seeing little red spots all over my upper arms some on my face. My face was really swollen but went down right after I stopped.
I’m getting super side tracked because so many things have been going on and I think I’m finally to the bottom of it all although I’ve suspected the ulcer and kidney probs then got a low hcv on a bloood test and found out anemia could be related to the ulcer.
I was about to take matters into my own hands in the mean time for a few days. Ordered some omeprazole, woke up took 40 mg. This is day two. I’m starting to feel a little normal but it knocked me out and when I woke up, I was sweating like crazy, my vision was weird again almost tinted maybe like low blood pressure, felt the disconnection again, energy levels GONE, could hardly move or talk. If I walked I stumbled and dropped things. I forgot everything and could not process info or thoughts it was the same thing that started happening when I took asprin. Except when I went to bed, I slept litterly 18 hrs straight. This also happens when I take certain things like unfortunately h2 blockers for allergies. Unfortunate because I’ve read these also help. The only one I can take is Claritin and read that it may make it worse.
Does anyone know what this is? Or sounds like?
I’m def goin to a doc, I didn’t before because I was so lethargic that I was apathetic I couldn’t move to get things moving. But it’s driving me insane what could this be? It can’t be one single thing. I think it all does go back to the overtaking NSAIDs tho and like I said before that it happened with tylonal. I’m just so curious because it’s so weird why certain random meds cause this. And it sucks because the omeprazole DID help my stomach quite a bit like woke up with NO bad upper abdominal stomach pain or feeling like I had a literal hole going thru my stomach just a knawing really emty feeling I guess. But I just cannot deal with those side effects every day for a month to two months I feel like I’m dying or stroking out…
Altho it has been getting a lil better since I started taking zinc not too much but like 30mg every  2 days n skip a week or two. Don’t need iron or copper levels or anything else messing up. But first day of zinc my stomach was randomly not being super hurting in the morning. But side tracked again. This thing idk what it is. I at this point would love any type of small explanation.

1. Static Websites Are So Last Decade
Look, your website might have the best products, killer services, and a sleek layout, but if it’s static, it’s like showing up to a red carpet in Crocs. Functional, sure. Exciting? Not so much. Motion graphics add that wow factor—turning “just another website” into an experience. It’s the difference between a handshake and a standing ovation.


---

2. First Impressions: Stop Them Mid-Scroll
People judge websites faster than I judge a coffee order that starts with “pumpkin spice.” You’ve got three seconds—THREE—to grab their attention. Motion graphics are like a fireworks show for your homepage. Animations that flow, bounce, or fade in make visitors go, “Wait, what’s this?!” Suddenly, they’re not just browsing—they’re glued to the screen like it’s the finale of their favorite Netflix series.


---

3. Button Clicks That Feel Like Magic
Have you ever clicked a button, and it just… clicked? No spark, no pizzazz, just…click? Motion graphics change the game. Buttons that hover, glow, or morph when you interact with them? Now, that’s satisfaction. It’s like your website is saying, “Hey, thanks for stopping by. You look great today, by the way.”


---

4. Explaining the Complicated Without a Lecture
Got a product or service that needs a little extra explanation? Motion graphics are your new best friend. Instead of long, boring text blocks (yawn), use an animated explainer. It’s like turning a textbook into a Pixar short. Your audience learns faster, and they’re way less likely to fall asleep mid-scroll.


---

5. Loading Screens That Don’t Feel Like Torture
Nobody likes waiting. (I mean, we live in a world where microwave popcorn is considered “slow.”) But a motion graphic loading screen? That’s different. It’s like a mini show while the main act gets ready. Suddenly, waiting doesn’t feel like an eternity—it feels like a VIP prelude.


---

6. Motion Graphics: The Secret Sauce for Brand Personality
Your brand isn’t boring, so why should your website be? Motion graphics bring your brand’s personality to life. A playful bounce, a dramatic reveal, a smooth transition—these little touches make your brand feel human. Think of it as your website’s way of saying, “Hey, I’ve got style and substance.”


---

7. Engagement Is the Name of the Game
Motion graphics don’t just make your site look cool—they keep visitors engaged. Whether it’s an animated scroll cue, a moving infographic, or a dynamic menu, these elements invite users to explore more. It’s like turning your website into a treasure map—except the treasure is your awesome content.


---

8. Closing Thoughts: Your Website, But Make It Shine
At the end of the day, your website is your digital storefront. So why not make it unforgettable? Motion graphics are the sparkle, the shine, the little extra oomph that keeps visitors coming back for more. So, ask yourself—does your website just sit there… or does it move people?


---

If you're looking for innovative ways to use these tools, here are some exciting ideas for you to explore.

### Beautiful Picture Frames

Give your picture frames a unique upgrade with pyrography designs. Using a wood-burning tool, create intricate borders or simple motifs around the frames. This enhancement will draw attention to your cherished photos and add a rustic feel to your décor.

### Handcrafted Jewelry and Accessories

Pyrography doesn't just have to stay in home décor. You can create beautiful jewelry pieces like pendants, earrings, or bracelets.

1hgu2ch,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hgu2ch/am_i_the_aita_for_not_wanting_to_cuddle_and_lay/,Am I the AITA for not wanting to cuddle and lay on my BF after working 18 hours?,"I don’t know what else to do at this point. 

Long story short, I (32F) was laid off and lost my job which resulted in me losing my apartment. I am in a hotel room, and I’ve now gotten 2 jobs (both restaurant/service jobs).

Today, I worked 17 hours (4:30am-3:30pm and 3:45pm-9:15pm) today and came home exhausted. I work at a coffee shop and a restaurant. So these 17 hours are on my feet and consistently interacting with strangers. These long days can make me want some peace and quiet “me” time when I get back to the hotel. 

My BF (36M) literally got his feelings “hurt” that I didn’t want to lay on top of him or cuddle him. I told him that I needed time, and the only time I had “me” time was when I didn’t work both jobs and he worked late. I explained that I am not in an emotional capacity to discuss his feelings after I worked 17 hours on my feet for us. He lost it after I turned over in bed on my left side (my right leg is longer than the other and it alleviates some pain), saying things like “oh you slaved over 17 hours for ME? No you did that for US.” And then took it so incredibly personally that I rolled over, he made me feel like absolute dog shit. Interrupting me the second I tried to explain that I trying to say that I was exhausted and to stop.

We have previous issues that I’d rather not mention but I’m at the point where I’m about to call a domestic hotline and leave (previous issues of that with him as well). 

AITA for telling my BF I need space and no-cuddle-time after putting on a face for 17 hours with hundreds of strangers? Am I the AITA for not wanting to come home and immediately be physically close with someone after 17 hours of working?

The only thing keeping me from going to a shelter is my cat. I cannot lose her. I had to give up my dogs when I lost my apartment and it broke me to the point where I went inpatient. I’m now on 5 different meds and that is why I’m asking here. I feel so much better and sooo completely different. Now I feel like this man has completely gaslit and manipulated me pre-treatment that I’m seeing it as bullshit now. But Idk what to think.

1hgtxpl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hgtxpl,Alistair Qing - Personal Review,"Restaurant: Alistair Qing

Location: Vista Mall, Santa Rosa, Laguna

Ordered Menu Items: 
White Chicken Noodle Soup
Beef Noodle Soup
Salt & Pepper Wings
Plain Rice 
Coffee Jelly
Black Tea (comes in a pot)

My mother and I went to Alistair Qing for brunch/early lunch because we were waiting for her appointment with the salon and decided to try out the noodles.

The white chicken is very flavorful on its own and the same can be said for the broth, it is not heavy and you can tell a lot of care has been put into the broth. 9/10

The beef noodles are also delicious, but not seen in the photo is that some pieces of beef have a slight char to them, but if anything the charred noted added more to the overall eating experience. I recommending asking for their housemade chili oil and putting it in the noodles if you are the type who loves heat. 8.5/10

I highly recommend the salt and pepper wings, despite being deep fried it was not heavy at all. Rice is a must for these wings. This is one of the pricier menu items, but it is good for sharing between two people. 9/10

Finally the coffee jelly. I rarely offer coffee-based desserts but I was curious about it when I saw how it was presented on the menu. Did not disappoint at all, if anything exceeded expectations. The cubes of jelly were quite big and what I thought was whipped cream on the menu was actually vanilla ice cream. It was like having a cold affo gatto, and it was well balanced, no harsh bitterness from the coffee, and it was a light and satisfying end to our meal. 10/10

As for the service, the staff were very accomodating and carry themselves in an approachable manner. No need to speak out loud to call their attention as they were very attentive during our meal.

Ambience wise the restaurant is very clean and orderly, there was no obnoxiously loud music from the restaurant (aside from the mall music of course)

Our total was around P 1,250 for everything. I would definitely visit again to try their other menu items next time, and maybe avoid the pricier options unless I'm with someone to share it with, other than that I would say that what we spent was worth it.",3,1734496746.0,PHFoodPorn,0,1.0,False

I have done this several times, and I have met great and creepy people, but I have never met men who are not Asians, Arabs, or Africans. 
So, I am taking another shot at meeting people that I have never talked to before, like Muslim white people or Hispanics, which I find very rare, but there is no harm in trying 🤷‍♀️.

Now, about me, the most important time of my day is the morning routine ( drinking black coffee, watching the Big Bang Theory as white noise, and watching birds fight over the seeds I put for them every day).

I also love reading, learning new things, and chatting online throughout the day (I have a full-time job, but I like to be distracted from serious matters).

Like, either I want to marry you, or I'm not even grabbing a coffee with you. Which such an insane way to approach dating, when the entire point of dating is to figure out if you enjoy each other. 

And it's always been that serious. The thing I said about middle school wasn't a joke. I had multiple girls tell me they didn't see a future with me IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. Even now that I'm in my 30s, so many women my age have this forceful aggressiveness to locking down commitments (and then weirdly freaking out about how fast things are moving). Thankfully, I think it's gotten a little bit better since the pandemic. I feel like our generation has started to figure out that there might be a better way to do things... better late than never.

We are pretty easygoing and like being home but also like the occasional cafe/restaurant visit (though we don't drink/do nightlife) and enjoy the outdoors, running, gardening and cooking. One of us will commute to Carson and the other to Peterson.

1: restored 1890s victorian in Ivy wild. A very old home and the accompanying smaller spaces but very cute. It has a roughly 8 mile commute for both of us. We like the house a lot but are a little worried about the age of the home and accompanying potential issues. The property manager off handedly mentioned it'd been treated for rodents already. Walkability/runnability of the area is a plus but we aren't huge spenders on the brewery/coffee scene and not sure if we'd take advantage of the area enough to justify the quirks of an old home (if there end up being a lot). Used to be an AirBnb and comes with the mattresses/couch.

2: renovated 1950s home in Palmer heights. We really love this house, especially the kitchen and amazing yard with raised beds here. It really seems like it could be a nice oasis. The property is awesome-only negative with this is that one of us would have a 13 mile commute to Carson (the other has an easy non I-25 7 miles to Peterson) and we've heard that rush hour can exacerbate that distance.

What would you choose and why? Any other concerns we should be paying attention to? Like I said, our main concern is commute distance for house 2 and the age of house 1.

Thanks in advance for all the feedback! This subreddit has been an awesome resource.

1hgtt8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hgtt8c/remaining_friends_after_rejection/,Remaining friends after rejection? ,"Hey! So the following info spans about 3 months. I'm 30F and my guy friend is 36M. I had a crush on him from the beginning, just finding him attractive and kind. I'd see him around town and if we were in the same places he'd come give me a hug or buy me a drink, etc but keep things short. We became acquaintances. Then, we followed each other on social media and he started sending me memes and funny things out of the blue. Realized we're into the same niche of music (metal actually lol) and shared a lot of music back and forth. Next, as we started seeing each other out we'd actually engage in longer conversation. Our first isolated hangout i actually asked him if he would be interested in seeing a movie with me. He took a 2 hour break from working to go with me and paid and all (he's got a lot of freedom with his job working from home). He invited me out for coffee once at a fancy place and paid then as well. Always pays on outings. That time he told me a lot about his dating history and stated that he likes to tell people all of his flaws upfront and said he has trouble with communication (actually reminds me of a friend with Asperger's). He can be very blunt and honest but also does not pick up on signals well, according to him in this convo. He volunteered all this info. Told me about his parents and family life. After that, we started spending more time together, he invites me over, teaches me to play guitar, and we laugh and talk, spending hours together. But I will say things never got physical and not exactly flirty. Anyway, we've developed a great friendship and i consider him close, I just happen to also see him as someone I could see myself with because we have similar interests and the vibe together is so natural and comfortable. The time just flies away.  Well, I incidentally asked him eventually if the energy was strictly platonic on his end or if there were any romantic interest. The answer was surprising to me, but he said he's never had a remote thought about the possibility at all but essentially I could be a good candidate. He made it clear that I'm not what he usually goes for, and he usually dated fit gym girls because he's always at the gym (i go to the gym a lot as well but i guess not as advanced as he's used to), but he isn't necessarily NOT attracted to me, he said he has this target on his back because he's a business man and so he's guarded but he knows I seem pretty genuine, and more about what he ""usually dates."" For every reason he'd come up with, he'd come up with his own rebuttal and all I did was listen and accept that it's still not a straight ""yes"" so it's a ""no""in my eyes. He said that to him we're just hanging out right now.  He didn't spare mentioning that if casual sex were to happen he wouldn't be opposed to that either. I shut that out right away since I'd have feelings to work through that he doesn't. He said that was perfectly fine. With all that being said, I'm just disappointed in the outcome and feel like I lost a potentially great friend had i not tried to make it romantic, but I had to know if feelings were mutual before getting silently invested too much.  So! Would you suggest going no contact, backing off to being acquaintances, or what? I don't think he's a bad person, I just don't understand wanting me around so much and interacting so much without intimacy if he didn't like me. I thought him not trying it sooner was a sign he could have genuine feelings but I do accept the rejection. He never mentioned something sexual until i said i had feelings beyond something platonic but he ran with it lol. Do you think being just friends is realistic?

Really like the quick adjust clasp design on the Spearfish though the Swordfish's is a quicker adjust design.
 
I was wearing the orange full lume Swordfish in a bright cactus green strap while he was rocking the nova tantalum (still regretting not springing for the Swordfish tantalum).

He showed me a couple of upcoming watches,  there's one where I like the case design but don't like the dial design, so I may not get it.

i told my therapist that what fucks me up the most is that i'll never see you again. she told me it might help to write about what i'd imagine happening if we did. so, this is what i came up with. kinda cringe, kinda weird, but maybe i just wanted to remember what it felt like when you wanted me - and at least this time i got an ending that i chose.

----
hey, you say as i close my side door, getting into your car. i let out an awkward chuckle as the car lurches forward, the air uncertain.

at the stoplight, you hold my face in your hand again. i flinch at your touch until i give in. i miss the warmth. you give me that starry-eyed look you used to give me so long ago before you pull away and look ahead as the light turns green.

we walk around cubao, looking for a coffee shop to pass the time. my legs are buckling at this point, but i hold onto my backpack strap. i refuse to touch you. 

at the vinyl store, i order that strawberry fizzy drink just to hold onto something familiar. we talk about normal things - it's hard to catch up when you talk everyday. at some point, another customer tries to squeeze behind you. you move your seat closer and our knees brush. i wait for you to readjust yourself, but you don't. you take my indifference as a green light and you let the full weight of your knee rest on mine. i try not to show how much i'm shaking.

back in the car, i show you the rock i got from my trip. it's yours, i tell you. you laugh, telling me i shouldn't have. but i wanted to, i say. in the quiet space of the car, we let the silence sit. i see you catch a glance at my hand resting on my thigh. without another word, i hide my hands underneath me.

we take a drive around tomas morato, looking for a dinner spot. in between the traffic lights, we laugh about the stupidest things. i ask you all the things i never got to: have you had pets? what are your cousins like? you ask me how i've been: what books i'm reading, coffee shops i've tried.

we find ourselves in a random parking lot behind a mall. it's unspoken, but no one wants to get out yet. i ask if you have some weed on you. you laugh and say you do, bringing it out already.

it doesn't take long before the smoke fills up the car and i can feel myself go lightheaded. soon, we're giggling even more about god knows what. in a moment of earnestness, i shift my body to look at you completely. your back is still slumped into the driver's seat. i can tell you're falling deeper into the high. 

so, i ask, what do you wanna do now? 

you turn to look at me as if it hurts to even move right now. your mouth opens to reply, but you end up coughing instead. i hand you your aquaflask, the one with my sticker, and you take a few gulps.

i don't know, you finally say. what do you wanna do?

i take a deep sigh and sink back into my chair. desire is the root of suffering, and some things are better left unsaid. did it even matter what i wanted? 

the moment swells and expands. anything felt possible.

later that night, you drop me off at the station and we hug goodbye.

-------------

the next few weeks are the same. we talk all day, laugh. i tell you about the guys i'm talking to, and you do the same. 

it's easy. simple, even.

on another saturday, we hit the town again. cruising around tomas morato for somewhere interesting. this time, i'm not trying to look good for you. i'm in my beige pants and blue too. you're in the same outfit i met you in.

we end up somewhere incoherent again, like every time we find somewhere to go, we just wind up wanting to be away from the world.

i ask if you have some weed again and you shake your head. i laugh and tell you not to worry about it.

we let the silence sit again. and it's that pit in my stomach, daunting like something's about to happen.

we're both staring at nothing really until you put on a song. one of the songs we cried to during our breakup.

i laugh and ask if you're feeling sentimental. i am, you reply without looking at me.

do you miss me, i ask. i do, you reply. we sit and let the song wash over us, our hands to ourselves.

when it ends, you turn to look at me. i turn to look at you. your hand reaches for mine, and i let it.

your palm resting on top of my palm, downturned and resting on my thigh. can you feel me trembling?

i've missed you, you say.

i know.

would you-

stop. don't, please.

you don't even know what i'm going to say.

i do. and i can't let you ask me because i would.

you look at me with such sad eyes. it's funny how nothing prepares you for this. for everything you've ever wanted.

you start the car and we sit in silence. you drop me off at the station and we hug goodbye.

I know it’s silly but maybe it’ll make me feel better to just write this out. And don’t worry, I have no interest in anything legal or criminal—pretty sure statute of limitations is over. Plus I was a willing participant and in CA, where I think the age of consent is 17. It just haunts me to this day and makes me sad for 17 year old me thinking this kind of attention was nice.

When I was 16, I worked at a steakhouse as a hostess. Because I only worked afternoons part-time after school, I was a solo hostess and had lots of free time doing nothing, just dusting menus and fetching water.

I will admit, at 16 I liked when boys gave me attention… it made me feel special. So, as the solo hostess with a bunch of male coworkers in a steakhouse, I did get hit on by some bussers, kitchen staff, and a particular server named Richard. 

Richard was really sweet to me. He would keep me company during slow shifts. He was always clean cut and his hair looked nice. He seemed cool, he had tattoos and a nice smile. I don’t remember what we talked about but he asked for my number one day so he could get me a smoothie during his break. That became a regular thing. He’d text me we’re working the same shift, he’d ask if I wanted a snack or a smoothie or a coffee. We’d count tips together. After 3-4 months I felt like we were friends but I definitely had a bit of a crush on him. 

When I turned 17 I got a haircut and my mom let me get highlights, I was so excited!! He complimented me on my hair and asked who I was getting so dressed up for, if I had boyfriend, etc. I said my boyfriend and I broke up… he said for my birthday he wanted to take me out. He then started flirting with me through text leading up to our “date” next Thursday. He sent some winky faces or would say he really liked what I was wearing earlier. He one time made a comment he could tell I wasn’t wearing any underwear one day, and asked why with a smirk. I was embarrassed but will admit, I knew this was him insinuating sexual interest in me. Sometimes after work he’d text me when he got home, asking me to send him a nice goodnight text to help him sleep soundly knowing a pretty girl like me was thinking of him. I don’t remember if I sent him any photos, but I do remember asking him what his dating life was like. He showed me pictures of the types of girls he was used to dating, but he said “The baddies aren’t long term though. Hoes like to play. And I don’t play like that ;)” or something. I remember feeling jealous like I wanted to impress him, be prettier or be a baddie too. I know it sounds stupid but I was 17 lol give me a break. I asked him something like “Well what are you then if you aren’t a player? You seem like you got hella girls.” And, this is important. He said “I won’t play you. I’m Daddy. As long as only I’m Daddy and no one else.”

Anyway, I drove to his place Thursday after school. He took me out and said his friend was a waiter at this sushi spot and could get me alcohol. He ordered me two beers and later said he added sake shots to them. We ate but I got really full, I felt buzzed and definitely tipsy. I remember wearing a blue dress with sunflowers on it and wondering if the waiters or customers could tell I wasn’t 21. I’m sure I looked like a baby but who knows. One of the servers was super pretty, tattoo’d, had nice fake eyelashes. She whispered something to Richard and looked at me and then walked away. His friend gave us the check shortly after and we left. 

He asked if I wanted to go on a drive, I said okay. Earlier I’d parked my car at his house and got into his car. We went on a walk around this playground / garden in a nearby neighborhood. I remember feeling weird because there were kids playing with their parents near where we parked. As we got further on the trail we sat on a bench. He kissed me and we madeout and he put his hands up my skirt and said I was wet. I wasn’t a virgin, but I knew I didn’t want to do it on a park bench. I asked to go back to the car and we held hands going back.

Once we got in the car I asked if we could go to his house? He said no, his parents are home… and they don’t know he’s with a girl. I said okay well where do you want to go? He parked on a hill nearby another park, in broad daylight still but less people around.

Anyway, he had sex with me. I remember feeling literally nothing while he fucked me and he was super super sweaty, sweat dripping down his face and onto me. I was disgusted but at this point we were already doing it and I knew it wouldn’t last much longer. He pulled my dress down and was pulling my hair and pulling me closer and closer. When he finished I screamed Oh Daddy like he asked me to. I was glad it was over. He asked if I came and I lied and said yes. I got dressed, he got dressed. He asked if I was ok I said yes. He drove me back to my car. I drove home, still pretty drunk. I got home and texted him thanks for dinner. He said he was glad I got home safe and would be thinking of me before bed. 

We continued working together until I left for college, but things were awkward. When I quit, I blocked him and forgot about him and moved on. I don’t talk about it but my therapist knows and, well, there really isn’t anything more to say.

I was 17 and an idiot, but I wasn’t innocent. I knew sleeping with a 26 year old was weird but I thought I was smart enough to deal with whatever consequences. I knew he wanted to have sex with me. I knew the beers would get me drunk. I never told him to stop. He didn’t assault me. I’m still disgusted when I think about this. I felt dirty and used. I was actually raped when I was 22 (I was asleep) and this encounter actually bothers me MORE—I remember it and I really truly feel complicit.

Anyway, I’m 27 now and actually a lesbian. Im in a happy relationship and my mental health is in order. I have a dog and great friends. Every few years he tries to follow me on IG or add me on FB but I just delete it and ignore.

Just wanted to write this out. I don’t know. I’m 27 now and my stomach churns thinking of having sex with even a 20 year old. Ugh. Gross. He’s gross.

And, I know Reddit has some creeps so first off gtfo and don’t dm me. If this fulfilled someones weird teen fantasy, fine. I don’t care. The world has gross people. I just wanted to tell it how it was. I’m sorry. Thanks for reading.",6,1734495792.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,0.67,False
