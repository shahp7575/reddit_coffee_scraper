1h9m3rp,https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1h9m3rp/does_wbtb_actually_make_lucidity_easier/,Does WBTB actually make Lucidity easier?,"So this morning I woke up like 4 hours before I was supposed to wake up, so I ended up getting out of bed drinking coffee and eating breakfast for the morning and about 5 hours after I initially got up, went back to sleep for like, 2 hours,  and i actually had a dream during this! 

I wasn't really lucid, and it was hard to keep track of, but I had one, and i think I may have actually exerted dream control without realizing it? I ended up flying in a specific direction I chose without really...trying? I guess?

So i have a couple of questions.

1: Does what I did actually count as WBTB considering it took so long for me to go back to sleep? 

2: Does WBTB actually make lucidity easier? I'm the kind of person where this sort of thing can easily ruin my sleep schedule so I'm really not sure I want to try and make this a habit unless it's really worth it.",1,1733674194.0,LucidDreaming,1,1.0,False

1h9m36j,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1h9m36j/my_parents_hate_that_im_fat_and_so_do_i/,My parents hate that I'm fat and so do I,"I'm 21 years old, 5 feet 5 and a half inches or 168 cm tall and I weigh about 145 pounds. I used to me a lot thinner when I was a teenager and I keep wishing I kept the same body even though I know I'm taller now.

My parents hate that I look chubby with a double chin. I keep getting comments on how they've never seen a person my age at my weight, how I clearly look unhealthy. I've been wearing loose clothes for a while but now that I'm fat, it's a problem. My mom has told me I don't need to buy new clothes because I'll be encouraged to eat more and hide  the extra weight in the looseness. She tells me I need to be able to fit into the clothes I wore when I teenager. Shes told me that I'm growing horizontally.  Dad has called me a fatass several times. I've been told that I'm tricking myself into thinking I'm skinny when I wear baggy shirts. My mom has told me "" You think you look so nice and skinny in that loose shirt. You look horrible. Just see yourself in the mirror and tell me if you look healthy.""

There are so many incidents I remember that I can't fit it in this post. The worst part is that it got into my head and I can't forget about it. I keep looking in the mirror and examining myself and feeling disgusted. Sometimes I can't even look in the mirror. One time me and my friends were taking pictures of my skinny friend and when i showed her a photo , she  immediately exclaimed that she looked fat in the photo and she wanted a another one. It wasn't even targeted at me . I still nearly burst into tears. If she's fat, then how grotesquely fat am I?

I have not been dealing with my self disgust well. I keep skipping meals whenever I can because I'm chubby enough where a few meals missing here and there won't matter. Sometimes I hope I can get sick with typhoid or something similar to loose the weight. My problem is that i stress eat to cope with my exams. So I'll justify my skipped meals by thinking the junk food will provide the calories I missed. I started to drink more coffee because I heard it makes you poop more. I try to reach 10K steps per day.

I want to just give up . I get so jealous when I see thin people talk about how they get body shamed because my parents and relatives were so much more nicer and kind to me when I was at my thinnest. I know it's not a fair comparison but I can't help but to think if they knew what I was going through, being thin in my place is more desirable than being at my weight. I know it's not a nice thing to say. 

I genuinely want to get out of this cycle of self hatred. I'm not independent because in my country, the parents pay for college and the child usually stays with them till they start working. I'm in my second year of college. I won't be leaving soon .

Please give me advice on what to do. I would very much appreciate it if you could help.

1h9m2jc,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeHive/comments/1h9m2jc/are_breville_espresso_machines_good/,Are Breville espresso machines good?,"Hey coffee enthusiasts! I've been a barista for over 8 years, and I've worked with countless espresso machines. Today, I want to share my honest thoughts about Breville espresso machines since I've noticed lots of questions popping up about them lately.

I'll cut straight to the chase - yes, Breville espresso machines are actually pretty great. I got my first Breville about five years ago, and it's still going strong. What really stands out is how they manage to balance quality with user-friendliness, which is pretty rare in the espresso machine world.

The thing that impressed me most was their temperature control system. If you're into coffee, you know that brewing temperature can make or break your espresso shot. Breville's PID temperature control (fancy term for super-precise temperature regulation) ensures you get consistent shots every time.

But let's talk about the elephant in the room - the price. While they're not the cheapest options out there, I'd argue they're worth the investment. When you break it down, making coffee at home saves you a ton compared to daily café visits. Plus, their machines tend to last for years with proper maintenance.

Speaking of maintenance, these machines are surprisingly easy to clean. Most parts are removable and dishwasher safe, which is a huge plus in my book. Trust me, when you're half-awake trying to make your morning coffee, you'll appreciate this feature.

What really sets Breville apart is their range. Whether you're a beginner who wants something simple or a coffee nerd who loves to experiment with different settings, they've got something for everyone. I've seen complete newbies pull decent shots within their first few tries.

If you're interested in checking them out, you can find their full range here: https://athometouch.com/breville

One thing to note though - like any espresso machine, they need some basic care. Descale regularly, clean the portafilter, and don't skimp on the grinder quality. A good grinder is crucial for getting the best out of these machines.

I especially love their built-in grinders in some models. While pure coffee snobs might prefer separate grinders, having an all-in-one solution is super convenient for daily use. The grind settings are precise enough for most people's needs.

The steam wands on Breville machines deserve a special mention. They produce the right pressure for creating that silky microfoam needed for latte art. I've managed to create some pretty decent rosettas with mine, though I'm still working on those fancy swans!

Bottom line? If you're serious about making quality espresso at home but don't want to deal with overly complex machines, Breville offers solid options. They're reliable, well-built, and produce consistently good results. Just make sure to pick the model that matches your skill level and needs.

I'd love to hear about your experiences with Breville machines or answer any specific questions you might have about them. Drop your thoughts in the comments!",1,1733674094.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

No it wasn’t from the sugar content or anything but it was almost like my caffeine shakes. I used to work at 7 Brew so I went from drinking it regularly (maybe too much) to completely stopping so now even caffeine in soda stresses my body out. 

Does the decaf they get in store have a small amount of caffeine still in there? I say that because a lot of coffee I’ve looked at getting on Amazon still has maybe 10% caffeine in it per cup and it made me wonder if their decaf wasn’t 100% or if I was just getting in my head about it when I drank it the other day.

1h9m20z,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsReadOfficial/comments/1h9m20z/the_two_who_made_me_loose_my_mind/,The two who made me loose my mind.,"So I work in a museum. It's a grand old tudor home built in the 1400s.

The building doesn't look quite typical of tudor architecture as during the 1500s part of a church wall was added to the main hall.

At it's finest point this house had acres of land, and many buildings attached to it. It had a grand garden with space for orchards.

Sadly now it's just the main house, all the extra building and beautiful gardens have gone. Although some of the orchard trees still remain.

We were coming to to the end of the day and only two guests remained int he hall. They were sipping coffee in the cafe at the enterance.

I decided to go and get cleaning supplies as it was my turn to clean the bathrooms. Unfortunately we have the cleaning cupboard at the far end of house, roughly a 2-3 minute to walk there and back.

At the back of the hall is the old family lodging range. In the late 1500s many families and businesses occupied the area.
Now the downstairs part is an education space, and upstairs just has various plaques describing the types of people who lived there.

And the sad story of a little boy who ahd died in the 1800s.

As I got to the education space door I heard footsteps. As I looked tot he stair cade beside me I saw the shadow of two people climbing the stairs.

I could hear them muttering about something but I paid no mind.

As I was getting the cleaning supplies I could heard their footsteps on the floor above.

So I returned to the front of the house and told my co worker who groaned. She had been eager to finish early and was annoyed that we'd be shutting late.

I went about my business, refilling toilet roll holders, cleaning parts of the house and hall.
Then I returned to the front desk and asked if the couple I'd seen had left yet.

My co worker said she hadn't seen or heard anyone. 
So I decided to go backwards around the usual route of the house, searching for the couple. I'd figured that they'd almost be finished by now. I searched the upstairs of the east range and there was no one around. Perplexed I went in to the medieval kitchen, searched the upper rooms there. Still no one.

I looked to the lodging range, ""surely they couldn't still be in there"" I thought as I walked inside.

Sure enough as i stepped into the lower half of the lodging range in heard what sounded like a ladies voice. I couldnt out her words. I also heard the same footsteps.

I reached for the education space door. I wanted to suss out where upstairs they were. The very second the door opened everything fell silent.

I figured they must have stopped to read a plaque and made my way upstairs.

Not a soul around.

I've dealt with hauntings in the old house before, but this one was very vivid. It left me confused and feeling like I was going insane.

A few weeks later I was told that no one was in the house so I took  quick look around to be sure. I saw a lady standing in the kitchen. All I could think as I told my colleague about her was ""God let me not be insane.""

Thankfully there was indeed a group of 4 people in the hall, the lady being one of them.

But I'll honestly never forget that day, I'll never forget how real it all was.

I have other stories too but I'll finish off with a short mention. A couple of my colleagues who work in the kitchen have had times where they've been entirely alone. When theyve heard someone whisper their name directly into  their ear.

This almost 600 year old building, is very haunted.",1,1733674056.0,LetsReadOfficial,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone, I’m subleasing my apartment at Rush from mid December to July.

- Rent is 1,060 a month and includes all utilities.

- Girls only! Two of the roommates are freshmen and the other is a sophomore.

- 4x4, which means you’ll have a room with a bathroom. The closet is walk in and very big, and the room is also the bigger layout in this apartment. 

- Directly across the street from campus so no car is needed. However if you are bringing one, the room is placed on the third floor, and conveniently on the side of the complex which is surrounding the parking deck.  

- Amenities include the pool, gym, mini golf, grills and patio, small dog park, fire pits, and a coffee bar.

The seal here is still good, as in I tested it again and the seal is still on securely. But, my assumption is that if something like this happens it’s a goner regardless right?

The jar sealed well overnight, just had one land on it this morning and it kept the seal. Not sure the best practice here! I am a beginner here! ",1,1733673969.0,Canning,2,1.0,False

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

As he exited Victoria Central Station, he crossed the road to a local coffee shop. There, he met with Conservative Deputy Leader* u/FreedomCanada2025*. The Deputy Leader gave him a small briefing about how things were going on in Vancouver, citing issues relating to crime and safety. A few hours later, they parted in their respective directions and Raymondl810 departed to Robson Square where he was expected to give a speech. He arrived 30 minutes before the speech to meet with locals who wanted to voice their opinions on certain issues. When the clock struck noon, Raymondl810 stepped up to the podium and started his speech.*

“Good afternoon to everyone here in Vancouver. Whether you are listening at home or are here in front of me, there are some things that you need to hear from me. Being citizens who live here, you know best about the situation. Although I live in Quebec City, I have spent much of my earlier life in the heart of this beautiful city. Like you, I have seen and noticed the crime and grime affecting this city.

So far, the government continues to stand behind closed doors and do who-knows-what. The last thing the government has taken notice of and recognized is the issues regarding public safety in Vancouver. No matter what this government does, we, the Official Opposition of Canada will stand up for you. We recognized that since the government isn't taking much action, we will be the ones to do it.

After all, what do **you** need? You need a safe environment to work and live in. After all, being safe is a simple human right. Whether it is funding or public plans for the future, anything would improve the situation here in Vancouver. We need a more responsible government, and we want change for our people.

Starting with the Trudeau government, we have seen a severe uptick in crime and violence directed at other individuals. Since then, many fingers have been pointed while not much action has been taken. I'll be honest with you all. This government is no different. They've done much talking and finger-pointing with hardly any action. After all, are they appearing in Vancouver to talk about crime and safety? Are they planning to address the situation directly? Have they finally taken the time to talk about something other than this opposition?”

*The crowd cheers and applauds loudly.*

“At the moment our entire party is getting familiar with the system around the city, understanding threats to the safety of Canadians. We are working and negotiating with security companies to understand risks around the city. This speech is one step, in raising awareness of this issue to the federal government, which has seemingly disappeared. We are living in a world where people cannot afford food and homes while also having their lives at risk from crime and racism.

Together, it's time to create action that we need to bring Canada forward. You already have an MP who will fight for you and only you. As racism continues within this province, the last thing we need is for more racist MPs to take control and govern our Parliament. My speech here is a simple call for action. Fight for your safety. Tell this government that you are waiting, and you deserve to live in a safe environment. Show this government that you mean action. Let's do this together to bring a safe and desirable future for Vancouver.”

*The crowd claps and cheers with immense effort. Then, he steps off the podium and cheers with supporters, before leaving back to his home in Quebec City.*",1,1733673693.0,cmhocpress,0,1.0,False

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

I use to live in midtown east and it was absolutely hectic in turtle bay hence why I decided to go more up north ahaha. 

So far I really feel a sense of community in the upper east¿ It’s super relaxing, quiet, as well as comforting :). I really like seeing families with their kids and people walking their dogs as it really reminds me of the suburbs of Georgia. 

A little about me :”)
I (20F) was born and raised in New York until the age of 12 then moved to Georgia for a bit! My parents, sibling, as well as close friends I made in middle as well as high school all live in Georgia so it definitely feels lonely here in the city without family and a support system. I’m really not the most out going but since it’s holiday season and I’m all by myself it definitely feels extra lonely. 

I really enjoy working out, running, long walks so if you’d like to be workout buddies or walking/running buddies feel free to reach out! (I usually walk on the morning and workout in the morning as well) I’m very big on health and wellness so my life revolves around that a lot. I’m also a big coffee/matcha person! I really enjoy solo traveling, gaming, recently getting into chess and planning on taking ballet lessons as well. Oh and my latest fixation are going to Irish pubs as they’re so fun haha. 

If any of this interests you please please feel free to reach out with a little introduction as I would LOVE to make some new friends and feel a sense of community :) ",2,1733673599.0,uppereastside,3,1.0,False

On the first date, his hands were shaking while drinking coffee and when I asked, he said his hands shake sometimes so I thought its some first time nervousness and brushed it off. After few dates, I saw him shaking more than normal so I asked him and he told that he has this shaking problem because of social anxiety same as his mom. Even then I felt there was something off but I didn't think much about it as I have seen him being normal other times. While having a conversation, he told me that he has Essential tremors (ET) and one of his kidney is small right from birth. These are there but everything is under control. I got panicked and consulted with the doctor and the doctors told me kidney is good after seeing the reports explaining that a human being needs only 1 kidney to live. ET on the other hand is not life threatening but it might be passed to the future generations. I had anxiety issues in the past and after he told me about his health condition, I'm not able to be peaceful. Whenever I'm with him, I'll be good and don't think about anything. When he's not there, I overthink about it and keep consulting with doctors. He's a good person and I am seeing positive signs  so I am confused with the decision.

Our dates went really well, and we met like 5 times. More than 4 hours each. The only thing was, it would take him 6-5 hours to reply to my message. Especially after hooking up two times, he got missing the next day for 6 hours. I felt bad, and used. On our last date, we were talking about exclusivity and I asked him to be exclusive, and he said im the only one he is seeing but he made a joke about it.  
After that date, same cycle happened he went missing for 6 hours, and showed 0 effort. I even told him to give me a call if he thinks he is bad at texting, he did not. So I pulled away, cause its clear he is not interested. He started messaging me more, asked me out on a date today. He started calling me cute, I love your energy i really wanna meet.So I called him, and told him how he made me feel, and how its so nice to spend time together but he does not put enough effort. He said, he wants to continue seeing me and enjoys it. He said he knows he is bad at communication but I shouldnt phrase him as a bad guy. I NEVER said anything related to him being a bad guy. But I felt so guilty for making him like that.

So today, I accepted his date invite. He told me he is so busy during the day so he wants to come to my place in the evening. He said, I have stuff to do, so I cant stay long. I openly told him, I want him to stay if he is going to come to my place if not we can grab a coffee together I said this cause I have to study afterwards and i know if he comes to  my house the next day Im gonna be crying cause It happened before and he knows how shitty I feel so i told him  I can walk him around my city.

I said ??? so are you cancelling or not what do you mean?!

He said yeah i am. So i called him, he was like ""so since you are studying, its the same thing"". ""you are busy so it shouldnt be something big for you"" im sorry bla bla but the way he told these with a smile. And I know he is not busy the whole day .
So I m thinking maybe he just wanted to have sex and leave after an hour.

First of all, in not from an English speaking country, but i hope, you can understand my post

I'm a nurse student and was clumsy and stupid, so I ended up with half a cup of coffee in my Mac 🤦‍♀️ luckily my insurance cover it. 

But to be honest, I was happy for my MacBook, but I'm not an apple fan. Right now, I'm using an iPad (6) for my study, but i need something better, and I'm thinking about getting a tablet (with keys and a pen) or a 2-in-1 (not sure about the difference. Really an amateur in the world).

My school got us full license for Microsoft 365 and it's always a bit impractical using an apple device in the school. I'm thinking about getting a Microsoft surface, but is getting a bit lost in it all. Does it have to be the newest of the new? Should I choose the Pro 7? Or maybe the Go 2 og 3? Should i look into a whole other brand?

I use the computer/tablet for notes, making presentation, writing essays and stuff, making mindmaps, mails and calendar

Then we talk literally for hours over text. Next day same thing all day texting. Then we only got the chance to message once as she felt horrible. Understandable, then on Wednesday we texted for hours again I asked if she'd be down for a voice call sometime she said sure maybe another time we can do a video call. Thursday rolls around and she's pretty unresponsive from normal. She messaged around 2pm said she was working a close and that she hoped I was having a good day so far. I said that if she wanted I could bring a coffee and some Advil to her work since she was probably still dealing with that headache. And coffee because we'll closing sucks ass. Around 10-11 she gets back to me and says sorry for not responding I was so busy at work lots of people. I appreciate the thought but I'm doing okay. Catch up with you tomorrow have a good night talk soon. (This was the last message I got from her). I said ""no worries I'm not gonna fault ya when you're at work and swamped with people. 

Yeah I kinda just thought if it were me It'd be kinda Nice to get coffee from someone at work😁

Never did get to see how cute you look in that uniform. Though you probably be cover in hair wearing gloves lol.(I had previously joking asked her to slip away mid shift to send a picture of what she looks like in uniform, for context she had sent me photos of what she looked like in certain outfits over the course of the week so this wasn't out of the blue.)

Good night. Call tomorrow evening?""

She hasn't messaged back at all. Friday evening I sent a message checking in at 10:30 pm. I said ""hey hope you had a good day today. I missed talking to you. Hope we can catch up soon. Have a good night.

Again no messages back. Have I just been ghosted. As far as I can talk she hasn't been active on Reddit. I really like her and she an absolute pleasure to talk to, we match on so many levels sexually, humourously, she very down to earth which I love, she a long texter like me so I don't feel too bad typing paragraphs, she's always tried to respond to every point I've said/asked. She seemed interested in video chatting and was talking to me for hours so it seems really odd for her to just drop off the side of the earth(ghost me). So anyone know why she's unresponsive all of a sudden?

I don't want to send her another message cause double texts are already bad and a triple text is basically a no go. But like I'm also genuinely worried about her. Cause it seems out of character ",1,1733672438.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1h9lgj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/1h9lgj6/client_overload_37week/,Client Overload (37/week),"How many clients do you see per week? And do you work in a private practice, agency, hospital, etc?

I started at a private practice a few months ago as a new MHC-LP. Everyone there is very nice and supportive but I’ve noticed that I’ve been getting pretty burnt out. I knew the practice required 3 nights a week so for those 3 days I’m working from the late morning till 8pm at night. It’s not something I like but I made the compromise. 

They schedule up to 37 clients/week per therapist and I was probably at a full schedule after about 2 months of working. I only get a 30 minute break unless I want to extend my work day so I can take a longer break. Sessions are 53 minutes each so I’m only getting max 7 minutes between sessions but as we all know, many clients like to linger (in-person and virtual) so I probably average 5 minutes between sessions.

Then I run into the problem of how do I want to spend those 5 minutes? Notes? Bathroom? Snack? Coffee? Looking at the next client’s previous notes (which I have to do)? Just breathing and not thinking about clients and clinical work?

This leaves me completely mentally and emotionally exhausted by the end of the day and I don’t know how to keep this up. I have to do all of my notes while I’m at home because I tend to want to spend those 5 minutes between sessions just trying to feel relaxed and normal. Also many of my clients have very traumatic backgrounds and/or have intense problems going on. 

Even though I want to continue to do research and read to keep up my education, I’m just not interested in case conceptualization when I’m so gassed on clinical work. I only get paid per session but I feel like if I had time during the “work day” I would be able to balance things more. 

Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated because I’ve noticed I haven’t had the full capacity to be there for my clients and help them which is not the kind of therapist I want to be.

I just completed the TryParse section a day or so ago but I don't understand what the ""**in**"" in the try parse function is for.

So what I understood is that tryparse is used to check if the value is of a certain datatype or not, if not the function will convert it ??? or you can just leave it be and add a loop to close or ask for another input in case the user types a different value.  
  
  \-> *int.TryParse(input\_variable,* **out** *datatype variable\_name)*

so here if string type data is stored in the input\_variable from Console.Write(); for say it's 10, the TryParse will change it into int datatype and stores it ( **outs** it ) in the variable\_name.  but there is ""in"" for this as well.

\-> *int.TryParse(input\_variable,* ***in*** *datatype variable\_name)*

what does this do ? **""in""** can't be used to store the data into another variable, can it? where is it used?

I tried GPT to understand it better but it seems my idiotic brain couldn't give a proper prompt cause even after 4 tries I don't understand it.  



This is the code that was taught and what I am using to understand the TryParse.

bool success = true ;

while (success)

{

Console.Write(""Enter a number: "");

string numinp = Console.ReadLine();   *//10h*



if (int.TryParse(numinp, out int num))

{

success = false;

Console.WriteLine(num);

}

else   *//goes here*

{

Console.WriteLine(""failed to convert"");

}

}

Console.ReadLine();

1h9lboo,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrakashamParakkatte/comments/1h9lboo/chapter_12_the_beautiful_freakout/,Chapter 12: The Beautiful Freak-Out,"For the first few days after I returned to work, everything felt normal enough. People asked for engagement pictures, and I showed them, smiling through the inevitable compliments and curious questions. It was as if I’d stepped into a stage scene where everyone knew their lines: “Oh, you both look adorable!” “Your dress is gorgeous!” Even I played along, dutifully nodding and offering practiced laughs. I sent David the photos too, almost as an afterthought, asking which one he liked best. He replied with a vague, “They’re all good,” and that was that. Nothing unusual, nothing dramatic—just a clean, neutral exchange in a neat little world.

It was in the following days that something shifted. The office hummed with its usual workload, and Vic and David were swamped—buried under tasks, barely coming up for air. I tried texting David to ask something trivial, but his replies were slow, delayed by incessant calls and meetings. When I finally found out he’d been speaking to someone from another team—a girl, someone who worked remotely—there was a little tug inside me. She was probably just a colleague he needed to coordinate with. Nothing to fuss over, right? I told myself that as I sipped my coffee, tapping my foot. It’s about work, calm down. Still, a tiny pinprick of jealousy needled me. Silly. I ignored it.

Then came Laya. She was from another floor, apparently some sort of eye-catching newcomer. David mentioned her in passing—he thought she was cute. That’s when my jealousy kicked into a higher gear. I hadn’t even laid eyes on her yet, but the idea that he found someone else at work interesting, someone close by, felt like a pebble in my shoe. I finally saw her one afternoon, strolling through the corridor. She was shorter than me, but perfectly proportioned, with a small, symmetrical face and long wavy hair that fell around her shoulders. Slim, fashionable, wearing clothes that screamed effortless style. She had that kind of look that makes you think she belongs in an ad for a trendy boutique. Instantly, I could see it: they’d look great together, Laya and David. The thought made my chest tighten unpleasantly.

That night, my uneasy feelings brewed into a dream that was equal parts comedy and horror. In it, David’s flat transformed into a sprawling treehouse high above a jungle. Monkeys chattered, parrots cawed, and I found myself surrounded by an odd mix of people—including Laya and several women who looked like they’d stepped off the set of Bigg Boss season two. While I struggled to get David’s attention, Laya waltzed right up to him, batting her lashes as if she’d invented flirting. Suddenly, she whisked him behind a bamboo curtain, leaving me outside, nose pressed against the leaves, feeling like a complete outsider. A strange tribal chief with a headdress of neon feathers tapped my shoulder, declaring, “It’s over! You must leave!” He shoved me off the treehouse, and I landed back in reality, sweaty and furious, my jealousy now supercharged thanks to that absurd nighttime spectacle.

When I got to the office the next day, Laya appeared in the flesh, heading toward the elevator. As if on cue, Naina, Vic, Damu, and even a few others crowded around David, urging him to “just say hi” or “make a move.” It was a circus of encouragement, voices layered and overlapping, pushing him toward her like a prize pony at an auction. The elevator doors dinged. David stood there, deer-in-the-headlights, and the tension in the hallway was suffocating. Andy, thank God, stepped in to bail him out with some excuse about urgent work at his desk, guiding David away from the frenzy. The crowd deflated, grumbling but backing off.

And what did I do? I just stood there, watching, heart pounding like a lunatic, wishing I could scream at everyone to leave him alone. Yet, I said nothing. Part of me was too jealous to speak up—if he talked to Laya and they hit it off, what then? Another part was just stunned by how uncomfortable he looked. Either way, I failed to defend him, to stand at his side. I hovered on the sidelines, letting the mob smother him with their expectations while I stewed in my own private jealousy.

In the days that followed, the big “David and Laya” project fizzled out. It turned out that once the initial excitement wore off, David didn’t feel any real connection. Laya, for all her good looks, was a surface-level infatuation that didn’t hold his interest. I should’ve been relieved—and I was. My jealousy receded a bit, my racing heart calmed. But in that quiet aftermath, a new feeling emerged: guilt.

Because after it all settled, I finally had a private talk with David. I brought up the situation, expecting him to laugh it off. Instead, he admitted how trapped he’d felt that day, how everyone’s prodding made him uncomfortable. He’d looked for me in that crowd, hoping I’d get it, that I’d say something, anything, to ease the pressure. He thought I understood him. But I’d done nothing. I could almost taste the disappointment in his voice.

That’s when I remembered the chess game from a few months ago. It started out as a relaxed match between David and me, a gentle dance of pawns and bishops. Then Vic and Damu hovered, backseat-driving my moves, making me tense and frustrated. David had noticed my discomfort without me saying a word. He’d acted bored, casually knocking over the pieces with a cheerful “Meh, let’s call it a day,” effectively ending the game and rescuing me from their meddling. He understood me so well then. He’d had my back without needing a single hint.

Now, when he needed a hint of understanding, I hadn’t stepped up. I’d been too tangled in my own feelings, too consumed by jealousy and fear, to come to his aid. The realization stung. Sure, my jealousy was human—it was rooted in fear of losing something precious. But that didn’t excuse my silence when he needed me.

As I stood there, I wanted to rewind time, to push through my insecurities and speak up for him like he once did for me. Instead, all I had were regrets and a growing sense of shame. I might have managed to keep David close by letting the Laya situation fade, but at what cost? I’d revealed that I couldn’t always understand him the way he understood me.

","Hello all. Recently made the plunge into espresso and picked up a Breville Barista Pro from Marshall's for $499. This is the model that has the upgraded Baratza grinder built in. I picked up a fresh bag of medium-dark beans from my local roaster (roasted about 3 days ago).

With all that said, I feel like the grinder isn't grinding well? Even when setting the internal burr to 1 and the external dial to 1, the coffee still tastes sour. I had better luck with Lavazza beans, but even those I had to grind at an internal burr setting of 1 and an external setting of 4 (out of 30). My extraction is within expected times/weights (18g in, 36g out in about 28s).

Is this normal? I read that after the upgrade, this machine should be capable of grinding up to medium roasts, and I have no interest in light roasts so I figured it would be good enough for my use case. However, it feels like I'm pushing it to it's grinding limit even with a medium dark.

When signing up, the company requires you to select four different coffees, which are grouped together as a single subscription. However, when you try to cancel, they only cancel one of the four coffees, leaving the other three active—and you continue to be charged for them.

To make matters worse, their cancellation process is cumbersome and requires direct contact with customer service, rather than offering a straightforward option online. Despite reaching out to their customer service team twice via email to address this issue, I received no resolution. They refused to offer any refunds or returns for the unwanted charges.

Had an instance with a coworker (early 30s f) that we would regularly smile at when we passed by each other in the halls.  Then I noticed she would end up booking a desk in my vicinity. We started just random chatting about our days, little history and music etc.  Then we would be sitting next to each other most weeks. Then i didn't see her book next to me for a few weeks, which I didn't think much of. Then when booked by me again I was o hey I missed ya last few weeks.  Then I again she was booking regularly, and conversation started ramping up.  

She mentioned she loved Pistachios so said I'd bring her coffee next week she'd love (w/pistachio). Told her to take down my number and let me know if she wasn't gonna be in or something came up (which she didn't at first but then eventually asked me later for it). Was hoping she would use it to just spark up convo but she did not.  Took it as a sign she might not be interested but I think in person she was so sweet and nice and we had a good rapport I figured she might not like to make the first move. 

So one day I mentioned the song Texas sun (she loves country) and had never heard of it so told her to add it. Following Monday I see the band is in town and I grab a ticket for myself (had a rough year and started getting introverted, finally felt like getting back out but figured I'll try a solo concert for the first time). Then I thought hey why not ask her.  

I messaged her on work chat asking her if she liked the song.  She said she loved it and so I told her I just found out they were in town and grabbed a ticket,  can grab anther one if she'd like.  She saw but no response. 

Before I left I said hey no pressure,  I know it's last minute but if you can make it you have my number. 

Did not hear from her, but went and had a great time at the khurangbin show.  Next week in the office she isn't booked by me,  and when she walked by my desk she looked and quickly looked away with a rather displeased or awkward face.  It crushed me.  I thought I went about it the least pressure way possible, and honestly even if we just went as friends or coworkers I would've been fine with that.  But it def made her uncomfortable. 

So then for the following month it's just awkward.  No more smiles in the halls.  Haven't talked since.  Just cold towards me. And she was someone who really helped brighten my day when I came into work after a tough year so it especially made me feel bad.  Last thing I wanted to do was make her uncomfortable.  

So last week I sent one last message.  Telling her he was overdue but I'm sorry to put her in an uncomfortable position and that she should be able to come into work without being bothered.  And that I would leave her alone.  

She saw, but again no response.  

I'm gonna stick to it and leave her alone.  Just want to hear opinions on what I may have done wrong.  Or what is possibly going through her head.

***One:***

An awful, ungodly stench struck Charlie the moment he opened the creaking front door of the nearly abandoned apartment complex. He winced, reflexively jerking his face away from the entryway so that his lungs might find new air. The thief’s chest audibly rattled as he voraciously sucked in the atmosphere outside the doorway, hand still gripping the brass doorknob. Curious, Theo leaned into the building, inhaling a sample of the escaping vapors. With a chastising shake of his head, he exhaled, chuckling as he did. The younger of the two thieves ducked under Charlie’s arm and pushed forward, seizing the opportunity emasculate his colleague’s fragile sensibilities - teasing him for being so dumbstruck by an aroma. However, Theo’s chronic sinusitis had diminished his sense of smell, unbeknownst to his older colleague. So, despite Theo being able to detect the potent aroma, it was unable to restrain him like it did Charlie.

Theo admired Charlie as a mentor and felt a hint of jealousy towards him, so he found satisfaction in having something to hold over his head. His untimely demise in one of these flats would prevent Theo from ever disclosing this admiration.

“*C’mon now, old man. No time to stop and smell the roses,*” Theo mocked, now leisurely strolling down the narrow, dimly lit lobby.

He wanted to move himself along, imaging himself running ahead to overtake Theo. But Charlie could not force his body through the partition and further into the corrosive scent, the intensity of which continued to increase as more stale air poured from the dilapidated building. Charlie struggled to identify what exactly could produce such a foul odor. It was acrid and gamey, reminiscent of meat spoiled in the summer sun; but at the same time, it also had a metallic and artificial quality, similar to the inside of a bustling factory. Stagnant, putrefied water closely resembled the stench, he considered, but it didn’t quite match.

Instead of following Theo in, Charlie raised a defiant middle finger as he bent over to retrieve the Vicks Vaporub from his backpack. From somewhere further down the hallway, he heard his partner flippantly squawk about Charlie’s feminine constitution. As he listened to the continued goading, Charlie could not fathom how Theo had developed such a bravado. The man was nearly as broke as he him, he had no girlfriend, and he carted around a body shaped like a neglected pear, one that had sat in the fruit bowl for a few too many days - rotting and sagging in all the wrong places. With Theo somehow *still* chattering on, Charlie sighed and smeared the waxy material over the crest of his upper lip as a barrier against the assaulting odor.

He wasn’t much better in comparison, though, Charlie lamented to himself. Gaunt and skeletal, he stood at a monstrous six foot seven inches. Though potentially commanding, his great height was offset by a total absence of muscle. Last time he checked, his weight clocked in at just shy of one hundred and twenty pounds. If Theo resembled a decaying pear, Charlie embodied an anemic popsicle stick. Perhaps, he mused, he and Theo were actually a perfect match - both objects that had well outlived their usefulness and only truly belonged at the heart of a landfill.

He at least possessed some companionship, he reflected, however meager it may be. Charlie could not stand the notion of being truly, utterly alone. He had grown to avoid it at all costs.

Protected from the disabling scent, Charlie took a beat to more thoroughly survey the street. Not that there was that much to see. The area was completely deserted and dilapidated, devoid of any sign of human habitation. That wasn’t always the case, though. Lutzwater boulevard used to represent the cornerstone of the city’s downtown, with this apartment complex acting as the linchpin that held it all together. Charlie relocated from the suburbs to the city at age ten, and could remember well the awe that the street’s opulence and glamour inspired when he rode his bike past with friends. A lot can change in thirty years, though. What remained was a mere shadow of what this place had once been. The many competing taverns and night clubs closed, the rowhomes that once contained up-and-coming senators and actors were derelict, and Lutzwater Heights, the nexus of it all, was almost empty. Only the son of the original owners, Christian, still resided inside, at least according to Theo’s contact.

Charlie didn’t let his eyes linger on any one part of Lutzwater boulevard for too long. The destruction was just too depressing, and in a certain sense, symbolic - the beauty of life and the promise of abundance in childhood turning to ash and shit as he aged.

One tiny piece of the deteriorating scenery, however, did strike Charlie in a way that gave him pause - it was something he had never noticed before. At its peak, Lutzwater Heights showcased an immaculately groomed front garden. Ochre and lavender flowers lined the entrance, greeting longtime residents, guests, and prospective residents of the prestigious building with an equal enthusiasm. Similar to the surrounding area, the garden had devolved into an abandoned wasteland, consisting only of overgrown shrubs and discarded liquor bottles. Close to his location at the stoop of the building, on the edge of the dead garden, however, sat a well that he did not recognize. He rode past the apartment complex thousands of times during his youth, and somehow never noticed the stone hatch with the accompanying wooden frame and bucket before now. The object’s presence was jarring against the backdrop of the dilapidated, contemporary architecture - and it would have been *even more* out of place when the location was at its prime. Now, it was able to partially conceal its uncanniness among the ruins. But thirty years ago, a pillory or a telephone booth sprouting out of the garden would have been less conspicuous than the well.

That said, it couldn’t have been new. To Charlie, that was infinitely more incomprehensible.

Another whiff of the horrible aroma broke his trance and reoriented Charlie to his current purpose on Lutzwater boulevard; Christian Lutzwater and his theoretical wealth. With information passed along from another career criminal, Theo believed there was a fortune hidden somewhere in the bubbling carcass of what *used* to be Lutzwater Heights, despite his parent’s real estate ventures going up in financial flames after their abrupt and cryptic disappearance over two decades ago.

*No idea how he could live with this fucking smell*, Charlie thought, zipping his bag and placing the Vaporub in his coat pocket, assuming correctly that he would need to reapply the wax a few more times during their scheduled security system consultation/covert casing of the building and their target. Before following Theo into Lutzwater Heights, he rummaged through his wallet for coins to throw down the well, seeking to obtain good fortune from the pagan deities who might be able to affect the outcome of their so-called business venture. Without looking away from the inside of his wallet, he stood up and began to pace towards the well.

Unexpectedly, a sharp pain crackled from his big toe and radiated through his foot. Not paying attention, Charlie had slammed his boot into the well’s hard stone mid-stride. Apparently, he had misjudged his distance between the stoop, himself, and the well. Charlie felt sure that it had been a meter away, at least it had been before he started searching for coins, but the new throbbing discomfort sincerely disagreed with his previous assessment.

Apparently, the well was practically next to him.

Absentmindedly, he tossed the coins into the abyss without gazing into its inky depths. But as he did, pain and confusion had sidetracked his intended wish. Seeing Theo turn a corner and disappear from view, his mind was instead dragged back to its more fundamental concern as he provided the well with its tithe.

With his subconscious behind the wheel, Charlie wished to never be alone again.

As soon as the coins were swallowed by the blackness, the well instantly began to exude the ungodly odor, like fumes exploding from an exhaust pipe. Charlie didn’t understand what had changed, but he the let vapors propel him into action, finally sprinting to catch up with Theo. As he entered Lutzwater Heights, Charlie thought he heard the metal clink against the well’s bottom, but there was something off about that, too. The sound he heard wasn’t exactly that of a handful of coins briefly clattering against stone. Instead, a sort of quiet but frantic skittering emanated from somewhere in the darkness, like thousands of human nails tapping nervously against chalk - almost in perfect synchrony, but not quite.

\----------------------------------------------

***Two:***

Christian Lutzwater looked profoundly unwell. Huge, dark half-moons shadowed the flesh below his eyes, pulling his face down so much that he appeared unshakably joyless, the resulting creases injecting a deep gloom into every facial expression he could manifest. By Theo’s estimation, the man was only forty years old, but his emaciated cheeks and greying comb-over could have given anyone the impression that he was, at best, pushing sixty. Despite those features, his well-pressed, blue pin-stripe suit and solid black tie indicated he was still interested in appearances. At the kitchen table in the building’s largest suite, situated at the very back of the third floor, the thieves watched as Christian humbly brewed them a pot of coffee. As he did, Charlie clandestinely scanned the area, determining where they could install a remote camera or two when he wasn’t paying attention.

*“So…where do you need the cameras? In the entrance, the alleyways…?* Theo paused, hoping Christian would pick up where he left off.

Despite not being an employee at Charlie’s security agency, Theo seemed to enjoy steering the consultations, occasionally giving the impression to their soon-to-be victims that he ran the company or that security was a family business he grew up in. In actuality, Theo didn’t know the first thing about installing security systems. Yet, his self-assured manner brought the trust of their targets more often than it didn’t.

As long as Theo successfully pulled off the his part in the robberies while wearing the uniform Charlie stole for him, he happily relinquished control. Time and time again, the blueprint worked. From Charlie’s perspective, why mess with a good thing just to feed his ego?

The operation was both clever and profitable. The thieves would steal from their marks a few days *prior* to installing the purchased security systems, which helped them avoid suspicion. It was a simple and easy to execute plan: they would attend consultations with their marks, confirm that they had valuable belongings and no preexisting security measures, and then they would strike. The marks suspected their wealth needed better monitoring - that’s why they had reached out to Charlie’s company in the first place, so it was no surprise when a burglary actually came to pass. After many of their targets were robbed, their only lingering regret was that they had not called Theo and Charlie sooner, as they imagined a security system may have been able to prevent the financial losses.

*“There are several sewer grates around the periphery of the property, a majority of them near the parking lot, ""* Christian remarked matter-of-factly.

*“I need them all covered by a remote video feed that I can have access to.”*

Theo, for all his virtues, did not have a talent for improvisation, and Christian’s answer had caught him off-guard. Stunned and at a loss, Theo turned to Charlie for help.

*“…I’m not sure that will cover the front gate or the entrance, Mr. Lutzwater.”* Charlie mumbled, who was also recovering from the overwhelming strangeness of his original response.

*Who the hell would try to enter the complex through the fucking sewers?*

From across the kitchen table, Christian set his pallid gaze on Charlie, visibly upset by the insinuation that he didn’t know what he wanted. He was not accustomed to being questioned by anyone, let alone by some blue-collar nobody. Slowly, however, his expression melted from righteous indignation back to its baseline, sorrowful state. Only after a short time did Mr. Lutzwater grasp that his request could be seen as outlandish to anyone unaware of what writhed within his apartment complex.

Without breaking eye contact with Charlie, he slowly conjured a synthetic grin to his face, the corners of his mouth seemingly held up and in position by imperceptible marionette strings.

*“Of course, the entrance will need to be monitored as well. I mentioned the sewer grates first because we’ve had local children spraying graffiti on those areas - seems like I can’t get it off my mind,”* he replied, following the statement with a mechanical chuckle and a sip of his coffee.

Feeling like the flow of conversation was back on track, Theo eagerly returned to the fold.

*“You sure you don’t want a camera for your apartment, too? Can never be too safe with gangs of delinquents roaming the streets,”* Theo proclaimed with a toothy smile.

*“Oh, I don’t live here, young man. I visit the property daily to make sure everything is still somewhat maintained, but I…but I certainly don’t sleep here.”*

A subtle tremor of fear creeped into Christian’s voice when he implied he would *never* spend the night at Lutzwater Heights. Not only did the prospect of sleeping here scare him, but it appeared like he believed he said something that he should not have. He abruptly shifted the conversation to finalizing his order. After signing the agreement, he excused himself to the restroom, allowing Charlie the opportunity to plant a small camera into the kitchen’s smoke detector.

*“Okay gentleman,”* Christian proclaimed as he returned from the bathroom, sitting down across from Charlie as he did, *“I believe we have negotiated the first part of the deal…”*

“*What other parts are there, sir?”* Charlie interjected. Mr. Lutzwater had already signed and paid for the security system. The older thief turned to his left, looking to see if his younger compatriot understood what Christian meant. But he was not at the table. Charlie darted his head wildly around its axis, trying to locate where Theo had gotten off to. Just moments before, he’d been beside Charlie, yet there had been no sounds of a chair scraping or Theo’s footsteps to suggest he’d left the table while he was briefly distracted by Mr. Lutzwater’s return.

When Charlie’s gaze found its way back to Christian, terror bloomed thick and ravenous deep within his chest. His pulse quickened, blood vibrating ferociously through his entire body. He blinked over and over again, but the image in front of him did not change.

Without warning, Mr. Lutzwater’s face has evolved into something else entirely.

*“You know what I mean, Charlie. How many times have we had this conversation? I need your answer. I need your answer now.”*

The phrase seeped listlessly out of one Christian’s new cavities. All of his facial features had been replaced by three oval slits, overflowing with impenetrable, inky darkness. Two vertical slits run parallel to each other over the top two-thirds of his skull, with one horizontal slit laying flatly under the both of them on the bottom third. The steel-blue skin in between the holes was smooth and blemishless, but it appeared dangerously taut, like a plastic bag that had been filled to brim and was primed to split and rupture at any moment - or, maybe, that tightness had already caused the skin to break, resulting in the three slits that were currently staring at him.

Charlie’s aching psyche interpreted the slits as a face, but they looked just as much like the holes in a power outlet as they did two long eyes and one even longer mouth. Yes, language had come from it, but the words had not emanated from his so-called ""mouth"". Instead, the statement leaked out of what Charlie assumed was Christian’s new left eye, causing the crevasse to widen slightly and tremble as it did.

*“You made your request - a cure for loneliness. That is something we can provide, but at a cost. We will want the first of your bloodline, as payment for our generosity.”*

*“I…I…”* Charlie blubbered.

In response to his indecision, all three slits began to ripple soundlessly, like a frustrated scream imperceptible to Charlie was being unleashed from all three orifices simultaneously.

Every night since the consultation, he had experienced the same nightmare. It always started as a memory, a replaying of events, but inevitably culminated with Christian’s transformation. But this was first one where he had actually answered the question. All the times before, the vision ended before he had made a decision.

For the remaining three days prior to the heist, Charlie’s sleep would be barren and nightmareless, but it would not be restful.

In that last nightmare, he agreed to the terms.

\------------

Each day, Theo checked the hidden camera’s recorded feed. In doing so, he determined that there may be something valuable secretly stored within the third-floor suite. In addition, he had confirmed that no one else currently lived inside Lutzwater Heights. No room had been rented out for at least half a decade.

Christian was not lying when he claimed that he visited the premises daily. Every day, about an hour before sundown like clockwork, Mr. Lutzwater would enter the apartment. Without wasting a second, he would pace over urgently to a painting on the wall. He would pull it aside, revealing that it was connected to the wall on a hinge. Because of the camera’s position, it was impossible to discern what lay beyond the painting; the camera’s angle hid that view. However, Christian very clearly took a key that hung around his neck, inserted it into something on the wall, and then reached in to the wall. To Theo, that meant there must be cash, jewelry, or something similarly worth our trouble concealed in that space.

Charlie squinted at the footage proudly displayed by Theo from his old and well-worn laptop. Something caught his eye that the younger thief had neglected to mention.

His lips were moving.

*“Who do you think he’s talking to?”* Charlie asked, praying that Theo had a good explanation.

*“Oh…uh…he’s probably on a call. Bluetooth or something,”* Theo replied while scratching the side of his head, clearly unbothered by the finding.

*“Hm. Yeah, I guess that makes sense.”* Charlie halfheartedly remarked, lying mostly to himself in that moment. There was no evidence to back-up Theo’s deduction. Christian didn’t appear to have ear buds in, nor did he ever take out a phone to indicate he was taking a call, and whenever he was in that apartment, his lips were *always* moving.

But the camera never caught anyone else in that apartment, Charlie told himself.

Theo must be right.

Id share my last give people FREE advice. I say free advice because im a body builder and i guess you can say i am a master at quickly changing my body  composition.

So i can do that for anyone else. I basically can  transform someone life if they want. Im always going around smiling at folks trying to raise them up.

Recently ive been having car problems ând everything been falling apart. I wanted a coffee from the gas station i had like $1.29  the coffee is 2 bucks.

There is this clerk really cool guy, i thought he would understand. This is quiktrip gas station by the way. I talk to this guy all the time we laugh and chat all the time.

So i go up to him and ask could he lend me 80 cents like i never been so down bad like this.

Hes like with an attitude ""I cant really do that but just this one time"" He hands me a pass that says get a free fountain drink.

I was pissed i was about to just say fuck it  ill just steal it. But me ive always been an honest individual never stolen anything. So i just took my ego out of it and thank them for pass.

As i was walking away i had a profound réalization that there are little to none people like me in this life. And that you dont make it in this life by love.

In fact its really weak to be that way. I then realized maybe i will be better off being evil.
When i say evil i dont mean going around making people lives miserable.

I mean putting my self first and being selfish. Kind of  like that clerk that went full corporate mode on me. To be honest i respect how he was because he was doing his job.

Then i start to think about how love backwards is spelled evil if you replace the i with o. Evil is also live backwards. Then i started to think about the vowels and how i is next to o the exact letters they use to mix these words up. 

So this morning i had a darker demeanor didnt smile didnt speak to the clerk. Just kept it a business transaction. This made me feel good and in return the kundalini shot up my back by feeling this way.

But also i havent had weed n cigarettes for 2 days and i could see im different its like im more stoic and serious and less caring but more respectful 

Realized i dont have to love just have to respect my self and others. Love gets you no where. Every main character of a movie do you see them on that lets love shit? Nope, But they sure have respect. So i décide to change myself or maybe this is how im supposed to be.

I had a hard time in Paris because of the filth, smells and chaos. Oddly enough, I had an easier time in Mexico City because, while it was more chaotic than Paris, there were places to escape the chaos, such as Alameda Park, Coyoacan, etc. So with that in mind, a lot of people seem to pit Tokyo and Seoul against each other, and I was wondering which one would be better? Or should I do a combination of the two. For Seoul, the coffee shops, the hiking and the DMZ are allures. For Tokyo, probably Shibuya Square, the architecture, the Capybara Cafe and Tokyo Disney if I go the full time would be the draw. I’ve also heard Tokyo has some cool roller coasters.

Once we were done, we stopped at a coffee shop for some hot treats, the weather is cold here. After that stop, I needed some cash so we walked to the nearest ATM. On our way to the ATM, we passed by the gym I go to. I mentioned to my daughter that it has been a few days since I was there.

Gym is my only hobby and at times I'm not even motivated to go. But I have been making an effort  to go whenever I can. Beside going to work and coming home, gym is my only scape. While there, I put my headphones on and mine my business. I come home feeling happy and energized. I find it to be very therapeutic to my physical and mental well being. 

For someone to make a comment like that, means they have serious controlling issues and that they do not care about me or my well being. The fact that this was not said to me instead to my 13 year old  bothered me a more.

*Lost Media, Now Found:*

*Excerpt from Strange Worlds, 1980. Found in an abandoned and derelict two-story home outside of Atlanta, Georgia.*

*Written by Ben Nakamura*

***Calculated Temporal Dissonance***\*: 6%. Increased from previously analyzed media.\*

On August 23rd, 1968, at approximately 11AM, two middle-aged American men walked into the lobby of a hotel in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil. The taller of the two men greeted the concierge sitting behind the desk, a grizzled older gentleman with a cigarette in his mouth and a scar over the bridge of his nose. He informed the concierge that they had a room booked and would be staying for three nights. The lobby was large and cavernous - a 3,000 square ft. floor plan with a slightly curved ceiling rising three stories above the two Americans. It was converted from a chapel into a hotel in the early 60s. Other than the Americans and the concierge, only two additional people were present in the lobby: another guest, a strapping young Brazilian man in a buttoned-down shirt, and the hotel's elderly custodian. The young Brazilian man was a patron of the hotel, sitting opposite the concierge's desk near a weakly spinning table fan, coffee in hand, and reading a newspaper. The custodian was seated at the same table as the young Brazilian man, chatting and waiting for the arrival of a maintenance worker. The shorter American excused himself to the restroom while the other got them both checked in. When he returned from the restroom, the taller American handed him a set of keys. As he did, he noticed the custodian was leering at the shorter of the travelers, his face contorted into an expression that relayed both confusion and anger. The custodian watched intently as the two men walked across the lobby and disappeared into the elevator. 

The Americans paced down the fifth-floor hallway to locate their rooms, 508 and 522. Although they were not adjoining as was requested, they decided not to bother the concierge by reporting this error, who had already been noticeably curt with the taller man while he was formally paying for the rooms. The shorter American entered 508, clutching the side of his head and informing his colleague he would like to rest. The taller American nodded and wordlessly strolled approximately eighty yards to his hotel room, intending to get a head start on work. 

Not more than an hour later, the taller American was startled by a wild flurry of knocks on the door of 522. A little jittery from surprise, he made his way toward the noise as the thunderstorm crashing into the dense wooden door only became more violent. Unsure of what he was about to encounter, he carefully pocketed a revolver into his suit jacket and looked through the peephole, nearly deafened by the abrupt onset of frenzied and incoherent shouting from the other side. It took him a moment to recognize the shorter American through the peephole through curtains of blood that had been drawn across his face. 

As he fearfully twisted the knob, the shorter American spilled into his room. As he passed, the taller American peeked his head cautiously outside the doorframe, not seeing anyone in either direction. When he turned back into the room, it became apparent that his friend had not been attacked by anyone- the damage was self-inflicted. He watched his colleague clawing at his head, haphazardly dragging splintered nails through ragged skin in short, savage bursts. The taller American tried to elicit the root cause of his colleague's erupting madness, but he could barely bring himself to form a coherent sentence, let alone shout it at a volume louder than the other man's screaming in the heat of the moment. The taller American gestured in a pleading motion for his colleague to explain what was going on, unaware that he had removed his left hand from his jacket pocket, which was still absent-mindedly clutching his sidearm. With a movement that the taller American recounted as simultaneously feral and strategic, the raving man placed his right hand over the hand holding the gun, pulled it up until it was level with his forehead, and then used his thumb to overpower his friend's index finger into the trigger, causing it to fire.

Why was the shorter American dead? Maybe, more critically, what had caused this chain of events to happen?

Feels like a riddle, right? A puzzle that could be solved with logic and intuition? Like some new age version of *""There is a farmer, and he must transport a fox, a goose and a bag of beans across the river on a raft, but the fox can't be with the goose because they'll eat it, and the goose can't be with the beans because they'll eat it…""* et cetera, et cetera. Ask your father or middle school philosophy teacher to explain that mind teaser if you've never heard it before. Don't write in and ask me - I only know the premise of the thought exercise, barely at that.

Perhaps a better comparison is this: the story of the two American men in Brazil feels like the cold opening of a particularly violent Agatha Christie novel. The mysterious pieces are laid bare for examination before the story begins in earnest - with a solution to the puzzle hidden just below the surface, waiting for a detective with a keen eye and keener wit to put it all together. Unfortunately, life does not unfold so thoughtfully. According to the story's narrator, Elliot Pierce, there would have been no possible way for him to have detected and prevented what transpired that day.

I sat down with Mr. Pierce, otherwise known as the Tall American, and his interpreter this week, and my, what a tangled web he wove. And if what he tells me is to be believed, I happen to agree with him - it was an unsolvable mystery from the jump. But that assumes this man's story is truthful. So, instead of asking you all, dear readers, to crack this riddle before the inevitable reveals, I ask you this instead - is Elliot Pierce a reliable narrator? 

*""We were ambassadors, not spies.""* recounted Elliot through his interpreter. ""Our business in the area was purely economic - part of a larger effort to keep lines of trade open between America and Brazil. Throughout the sixties and into the early seventies, JFK and his administration did their damndest to maintain a healthy foreign policy; we were just a small piece of that.  I have no idea why we were targeted with that weapon. I try to keep myself from wondering too hard - sometimes I can feel a stroke coming on when I get too fixated on trying to make it all make sense."" 

Somberly, Elliot continued his recollection of the events that followed the gunshot. He couldn't tell me how long he was standing motionless in front of Greg Fields's corpse, AKA the shorter American. Still, given the commotion, he couldn't imagine it was more than a few minutes before his trance was interrupted by the arrival of other hotelgoers to 522, looking to determine the source of the explosive disturbance. When he was found, he was sitting at a small table with a single chair across from Greg. Elliot doesn't recall going from standing to sitting - most of the details immediately after the gunshot, apparently, are lost to him. The body had fallen backward onto the room's cot, and Mr. Pierce seemingly couldn't pull his eyes from the sight of it all. Eventually, though, he was pulled away - manually, by a Brazilian police officer, letting Elliot know in a language he did not understand that he was under arrest for murder. He was still clutching the revolver in his hand when he was first discovered.

At the police station, he was able to put in a call to his contacts in the US. They let Elliot know that a lawyer and some additional members of his department would be deployed ASAP to Brazil. In the meantime, Elliot was, thankfully, not interrogated too harshly. Although this crime had occurred on Brazilian soil, from the cop's perspective, no South American citizens were involved. As long as Elliot remained calm during detainment, the police were in no rush to spend resources determining his guilt or innocence. They'd leave it to the Americans.

""It wasn't nearly as bad as I initially feared,"" Elliot relayed, although his eyes betrayed a lingering pain that seemed discordant with the words coming from his interpreter. 

""The guards, at the least the ones that knew a little English, were kind to me. In a moment of suffocating boredom, they even provided me with a pencil and a book of crossword puzzles from my suitcase. Looking back, it is very surreal. That act of hospitality saved my life.""

In the five days before his American counterparts arrived in Brazil, Elliot would have only one visitor. He did not know this man - nor did he recognize him from the hotel. He was not the concierge, the custodian, or the muscular young Brazilian.

""He first caught my attention arguing with the guards outside my cell. He didn't look Brazilian; he looked American - medium build, blue eyes, somewhere in his 30s. Couldn't tell you exactly what they said - but he spoke the local tongue beautifully. In the end, the guards relented and walked into another room. Then, he stepped into the cell using the guard's key.""

Elliot recounted all of this very rapidly - his interpreter barely kept up, but Mr. Pierce did not seem aware of this. Or he chose to ignore it, looking to move through this information as quickly as possible. 

""So he steps into my dingy cell with an expensive-looking navy blue suit and briefcase. The holding room had three cells, but none of the others were occupied, so I was alone with this stranger. Instead of sitting across from me, he pulls up a chair and sits beside me, uncomfortably close. I asked him who he was and if he was from my department, and he said nothing in response. He just smiled at me for a few seconds - with full eye contact. Don't think I ever saw him blink. Then, he slowly and very carefully opened his briefcase, all the while still looking into my eyes. No papers, pens, or files in that thing. It's completely empty, save a small brown box. He opens it gently, and it turns out to be a goddamned music box. Tiny harpsichord and everything.""

As Mr. Pierce tells it, this silent visitor sat next to him with the music box, opened it, and let it play for about a minute. What came out wasn't any song that he recognized - in fact, it didn't even really sound like a *song* at all. 

""I'm no musician, but what came out of that box wasn't a song. It was a sequence of three notes, playing without any discernable rhythm, and it just kept repeating in the same order, over and over. And part of me thinks I'm dreaming because, I mean, what in the hell is going on? But after about 60 seconds, he gently closes the box, puts it back in his briefcase, and gets up from where he was sitting. As he was standing over me, I noticed a small glob of green foam in his right ear - he had been wearing earplugs that entire time. Without a word, he walks out of the cell. Never seen him again in my life.""

After he said this, Elliot's words finally started to slow down to a normal, human speed. In the interview, I initially interpreted this change to mean something important was to follow. I was partially right - something important was to follow, but I think he needed to slow down primarily because he was struggling to recollect something traumatic. 

""So the man in the blue suit leaves, and I tried to ignore the eeriness of that whole interaction. I put my focus back on my crosswords, you know? But I couldn't put my mind to the puzzles because something else was bugging me. He closed the music box in the middle of the note sequence. He had let these three notes play in the same order for a whole fucking minute but then stopped on the second one. He didn't let the third one play the last time.""

Tears began to pool in Elliot's eyes: ""I started to realize I could still hear that second note in my head. Initially, it was quiet, like it was in the back of my thoughts I guess. But soon, that note was all that was in my head; I couldn't hear myself think over it. The sequence was just so painfully unfinished - literally, it was causing me physical pain. I wanted to hear that third note so the sequence would end, but I couldn't find it in my memories.

""Imagine the worst migraine of your life and multiply it by at least a hundred. I have to get up because I can't sit still. I run circles around the inside of my cell, but it doesn't lessen the pain. All the while, that second note just keeps getting louder. It's shrill agony. Like nails on a chalkboard, but it's a thousand hands on a thousand chalkboards. I started hitting my head against the wall and the floor because it felt like the note was creating physical pressure in my head, meaning if I cracked my skull open, the sound and the pain would float out of me and away.""

""And then…well, you know"" shrugging his shoulders in the direction of his sign language interpreter. 

He didn't give me the gory details, but he didn't need to. What I knew coming into this interview was that Elliot Pierce had been acquitted of the murder of Greg Fields by reason of insanity. He would describe, to his defense attorney and then on the stand, that Greg had been ""infected"" by the unknown man's music box. Elliot speculated this happened when they checked into the hotel when Greg used the bathroom; that man (or another agent of his, he would later say) must have exposed him to the sequence. Subsequently, the tall American proposed that the short American had taken his own life to relieve himself of the pain. The same reason Elliot had deafened himself by gouging his eardrums in turn with the sharpened pencil he had previously been doing crosswords with. 

Unarguably a compelling tale. Moreover, there are some auditory precedents for Elliot's allegations. The day after the interview, I gave Bernard Lane, professor of music theory and history at Berkly, a call to help contextualize what Mr. Pierce had told me: 

""What he seems to be alluding to is interesting - the 'unfinished sequence causing physical pain', I mean. Music, at its core, is about tension and release. Most melodies exist in what is called a 'key'. A key is a set of notes, usually 7 total, that fit together in a comfortable way. Take C major, for example. The notes in C major fit together comfortably because they all point to C Major as the 'home chord', also known as the 'tonic'. The tension, then, is playing notes other than C and chords other than C major - the note of G or the chord of G major, for example's sake. The release, in turn, is returning to C from G or from G major to C major.

""The phrase' home chord' is very elegant in its design - think about it this way, what is life but experiencing the tension and the discomfort of the world outside your home, only to then feel resolution and relief upon returning home when the day is through? Now, imagine leaving home but never being able to return, no matter how hard you will it. That tension, that discomfort - I imagine that is what Mr. Pierce is trying to describe. Now, do I think sound could be weaponized in a way that would use this principle to create unbearable physical pain? No, I think not."" Dr. Lane concluded.

Of course, the improbabilities in Elliot's story go far beyond the outlandishness of weaponized melodies. First off, not a single guard at the Brazilian jail recalled the strange visitation of ""the man in the blue suit"". Nor did any employee at the hotel recognize this man matching Elliot's description. Then, there is the question of the revolver - if Elliot's business in Brazil was peaceful, why did he have a loaded sidearm at the ready in his hotel room? 

The smoking gun of the prosecution's case, metaphorically speaking, was Elliot's potential motivation. It came out in court that the short American had slept with the Tall American's wife, and he only discovered the adultery nine months before Greg's death. Elliot fiercely denied this fact was related to the situation in any capacity, attesting that it was a one-time mistake on the part of his wife and they had already worked through it. The D.A. who tried the case, Phil Lindworth, had this to say:

""I think we all know why Elliot Pierce killed Greg Fields,"" He growled, gravelly voice slightly hard to hear over an already lousy office phone connection. 

""Adultery can make people angry, and it can put them in a rage, but it doesn't make them insane. The jury was blinded by the spectacle. Elliot Pierce had days in a Brazilian cell to think and plan before he was interrogated, more than enough time to come up with a story that would make him look batshit. He's clever, I'll give him that. I think he realized the story alone wouldn't be enough to convince the jury of his faked insanity; he needed something more dramatic to sell it. Traumatically skewering your eardrums with graphite is one way to get people's attention. But in the end, it always comes back to Occam's Razor.""

Occam's Razor is a deductive reasoning tool that states that the simplest explanation is the most likely explanation. By virtue of odds, Greg was much more likely murdered by his cuckolded friend rather than by a killer music box. Elliot, however, has stood his ground in the years since his verdict. After being released from an asylum two years after Greg's murder, he has been very prolific in many conspiracy theory communities, espousing the claim that his own government experimented on him and Greg with a ""sonic weapon."" He theorizes that they sent him and Greg to Brazil specifically with the intent of having them die there discretely to prove the weapon's functionality. To further back his claims, he refers to a bizarre and tragic grocery store fire in Northern Maine that happened while he was institutionalized: 

""A year into my hospitalization, everything seemed to finally be going alright. I was even starting to believe what they were telling me: that there was no sonic weapon and that I killed Greg in a jealous rage. Then, I read about this fire, and it made my head nearly spin. Nine people killed inside a grocery store, burned to a crisp. No one knows what happened. Three out of the nine had pierced their eardrums with a sharp object: a metal antenna from a radio and two screwdrivers, if I remember correctly. When I talk to people, and they try to hide from the truth, they'll say things like it's a coincidence. Elliot, you're seeing patterns where they aren't. And to them, I say - none of the doors were locked, and it took a while for the building to collapse. How did every single person in that store die? Why didn't they run out of the fire? I could understand half of them being caught in the blaze, but all of them? Or, instead, was that fucking sequence tested again? Bigger this time, more people and a larger space. Maybe they played it over the intercom or something. Of course, they still performed the test in an isolated area; that grocery store was in a town of only 200 people.""

""When the fire started, it wasn't a tragic accident - it was because the victims hearing that note started the fire. And then they let themselves burn to escape that fucking sound"" Elliot signed while staring daggers into me. It became clear that he did not do well with confrontation, as he then cut the interview short and left.

Where do I land on all of this? God, it changes every day. I'll admit it, the grocery store incident is strange and compelling. Critics of Elliot's claims will say that those three people did not impale themselves purposely - small propane canisters must have exploded and launched those items into their victims. Admittedly, this is not a great explanation, but I suppose it's possible. 

So, now that I've presented all of the information - is Elliot Pierce a reliable narrator? Or just an insidiously clever murderer? Is it a little of both? Do we not even have enough information to be asking the right questions?

As I said - there will likely never be a clear-cut answer to what happened in Brazil or Maine. Life refuses to be confined to the rules of a puzzle. That doesn't mean we stop asking the questions, though.

Does anyone know if accessing OneLake data through the ADLS connector in Power Query or the ADLS API incur any ADLS (Azure Data Lake Storage gen2) costs?

Here's an example Power Query M code:

    let
        Source = AzureStorage.DataLake(""https://onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com/insertworkspaceidhere/insertlakehouseidhere/Tables/DeltaCoffee/"", [HierarchicalNavigation=true]),
        ToDelta = DeltaLake.Table(Source)
    in
        ToDelta

[https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en/blog/read-data-from-delta-lake-tables-with-the-deltalake-table-m-function](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en/blog/read-data-from-delta-lake-tables-with-the-deltalake-table-m-function)

[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/onelake-access-api](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/onelake-access-api)

I'm assuming that this will only incur OneLake transactions against the Fabric capacity, and won't result in any ADLS costs, but does anyone have a definitive answer on this?

As we found out here: [Dataflow Gen2 Fast Copy with csv source: possible? : r/MicrosoftFabric](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFabric/comments/1h9fvmf/dataflow_gen2_fast_copy_with_csv_source_possible/) some functionality seems to only work when accessing the OneLake data through the ADLS connector. So I just want to check that this doesn't incur any ADLS costs somehow ;-) I have practically no experience with ADLS.

You know that magical feeling when you step outside on a crisp winter morning, fresh snow crunching beneath your feet? Well, that feeling isn't so magical when your toes are freezing and your socks are soaked through. Trust me, I learned this the hard way! 🥶

Let me take you back to last January. There I was, halfway up a trail in the Adirondacks, feeling pretty smug about my ""bargain"" boots from the outlet mall. The snow was pristine, the sky was crystal clear, and I thought I was prepared for anything. *Narrator voice: He was not prepared.* Two hours into what should have been an incredible winter hike, my feet were so cold and wet that I could barely feel my toes. That day taught me a lesson I'll never forget: when it comes to winter boots, cutting corners is like playing Russian roulette with frostbite.

Since then, I've become somewhat obsessed with finding the perfect winter boots. I've tested dozens of pairs, trudged through snowdrifts, stood for hours in freezing temperatures, and even deliberately stepped into icy puddles (much to my partner's amusement) – all in the name of research. This isn't just another review post; this is my love letter to warm, dry feet.

# What Makes a Winter Boot Actually Worth Your Money? 🤔

Before we dive into specific recommendations, let's talk about what separates the snow champions from the slush slackers. After countless hours of research and real-world testing, here's what I've learned really matters:

**Insulation: Your Personal Foot Furnace** Think of good insulation like a bear hug for your feet. Most quality boots use Thinsulate, and here's my temperature breakdown based on personal experience:

* 200g: Perfect for active use, like winter hiking or snowball fights
* 400g: The sweet spot for most winter activities
* 600g+: When you're planning to stand still in the cold (ice fishing, anyone?)

**Waterproofing: The Ultimate Deal-Breaker** Let me tell you something – you haven't known true misery until you've spent a day with wet socks in freezing temperatures. The best boots combine:

* Water-resistant or waterproof leather uppers
* Sealed seams (crucial!)
* Breathable membranes like Gore-Tex or proprietary alternatives

**Traction: Your Ice-Dancing Insurance Policy** Remember that time I face-planted in front of the whole coffee shop because of slick soles? Never again! The best winter boots have:

* Deep, aggressive lugs
* Special rubber compounds that stay flexible in cold
* Multi-directional patterns for grip in all directions

# The Winter Warriors: My Top Picks Based on Real Experience 🏆

# Best Overall: Sorel Caribou - The GOAT of Winter Boots

Oh man, where do I even start with these? Remember that ski trip I mentioned? Picture this: -30°F windchill, standing in the lift line for what felt like eternity, and my feet were actually *too warm*. That's when I knew these boots were something special.

**What Makes Them Amazing:**

* Temperature rated to -40°F (and they mean it!)
* Removable liner that actually dries overnight
* Built like a tank but surprisingly comfortable
* Waterproof leather that laughs at slush

*Real Talk Experience:* Last winter, I spent three hours photographing the Northern Lights in these bad boys. Everyone else was doing the frozen-toe dance, while I was comfortable enough to focus on getting the perfect shot. Worth. Every. Penny.

# Best for Hiking: Kamik Nation Plus - The Underdog Champion

If Sorel is the luxury SUV of winter boots, the Kamik Nation Plus is the surprisingly capable crossover that makes you question why anyone pays more. These boots have become my go-to for winter hiking, and they've never let me down.

**Standout Features:**

* Aggressive tread that grips like a mountain goat
* Surprisingly lightweight for their warmth
* Price point that won't make your wallet cry
* Removable liner that's actually easy to remove (looking at you, other brands)

# Best Style-Conscious Option: Danner Free Spirit

For those days when you need to look good but don't want to sacrifice warmth. These boots are like the James Bond of winter footwear – sophisticated but ready for action.

**Why They're Special:**

* Clean, classic design that works with anything
* Waterproof but doesn't look like a moon boot
* Comfortable enough for all-day wear
* Perfect for city dwellers who still adventure

Here's a detailed comparison of my top picks:

|Boot Model|Temperature Rating|Weight (per pair)|Best Use Case|Price Range|Style Factor|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Sorel Caribou|\-40°F|4.8 lbs|All-around winter wear|$$$|Classic/Rugged|
|Kamik Nation Plus|\-25°F|3.6 lbs|Winter hiking|$$|Practical|
|Danner Free Spirit|\-20°F|2.8 lbs|Urban adventures|$$$|Sophisticated|
|Baffin Impact|\-148°F|7.5 lbs|Arctic expeditions|$$$$|Technical|
|Hoka Kaha 2 GTX|15°F|2.5 lbs|Active winter use|$$$|Modern|

# The Boot Whisperer's Guide to Care and Maintenance 🧹

Listen, I've killed enough boots to know that proper care makes the difference between one season and many. Here's my tried-and-true maintenance routine:

1. **Post-Adventure Care:**
   * Brush off snow and salt as soon as you get home
   * Remove liners (if possible) to dry separately
   * Use a damp cloth to wipe down the exterior
2. **Regular Maintenance:**
   * Apply leather conditioner monthly during heavy use
   * Check and replace laces as needed
   * Clean and re-waterproof at season's start and mid-season
3. **Storage Tips:**
   * Never store wet or damp
   * Keep in a cool, dry place (not your humid basement!)
   * Stuff with newspaper to maintain shape

# Walking on Sunshine (or Ice) - Safety First! 🚶‍♂️

After witnessing countless winter wipeouts (and experiencing a few myself), here's what I've learned about staying upright:

**The Penguin Walk Really Works:**

* Short steps
* Slightly bent knees
* Weight slightly forward
* Arms loose at sides

**Pro Tips for Icy Conditions:**

* Walk like you're trying to squash grapes
* Test potentially icy surfaces with a gentle foot tap
* Stay alert for black ice, especially in shaded areas

# The Green Side of Winter Boots 🌱

Climate change is real (just ask any winter sports enthusiast), and I've become increasingly mindful of my gear's environmental impact. Here's what I look for in sustainable winter boots:

**Eco-Friendly Features:**

* Recycled materials in liners and insulation
* Sustainably sourced leather and rubber
* Repairable construction
* Brands with transparent environmental practices

# Final Thoughts and Future Footsteps

After countless miles in the snow, thousands of dollars in boots (don't tell my partner 😅), and more winter adventures than I can count, I can confidently say that investing in quality winter boots is one of the best decisions you can make for your winter wellbeing.

Remember: your feet carry you through life's adventures. Treat them right, and they'll take you to amazing places – even in the depths of winter.

**Edit 1:** Wow, this really blew up! Thanks for all the awards and amazing discussions in the comments! 🙏

**Edit 2:** To address some common questions:

* Yes, all these boots come in wide sizes
* The prices listed are from my last check, but they may vary
* I'm not sponsored by any of these brands (though hey, if you're reading this, boot companies... 😉)

It has been pretty intense and we are very much in love. Initially, we had a great sex life. He couldn’t keep his hands off of me and I couldn’t keep my hands off of him. Around about July/August of this year, he showed little interest in having sex with me or even showing much intimacy like kissing. he was only really interested in cuddling. Eventually I brought it up with him and he claimed he was having issues with his sex drive due to depression, which he has been going through. We have had sex a couple of times over the past few months, and it feels incredibly forced (as in, he is forcing himself to do it because he knows he should to be a good boyfriend) after a few minutes, he stops “wants to take a break”, and then after a couple minutes he says he doesn’t want to have sex anymore. 

Naturally I’ve been hurt by his lack of interest in sleeping with me. I have been crying, feeling unwanted, ugly, undesired, and he knows I feel this way. He told me it would get better once his depression heals. I felt bad for him so I have been taking everything out of me (I also struggle with bipolar depression and anxiety, which he knows about) to love him, care for him, cook for him, bring him little surprises like treats, and have him come home from work to a clean home over the past few months. On the early mornings before he would go to work, I would often go out and get him a coffee as a nice gesture, only to find out he used that time away from me to masturbate to other women. 

I’ve been staying with him every night for the past five weeks, and during the first week, he left the bedroom to masturbate to porn in the bathroom when he thought I was asleep. I texted him and told him he had a perfectly good woman in bed beside him. After he finished he came into bed sheepishly and said he was sorry and because I had a minor headache, he chose to watch porn instead of initiating sex. He promised me that if it weren’t for me having a headache, he would have initiated. Over the past few weeks I’ve been paying extra attention and can hear him masturbating through the door when he thinks I can’t hear. I walked in on him and he pretended to be asleep. I said to him that night “you have a masturbation problem”. He heard me but said nothing. The next morning, I brought it up with him again and I asked him how many times he watched porn since I’ve been here he said he didn’t know. Eventually, I got the answer out of him that had been just a handful of times, but he wasn’t exactly sure. I had to beg and plead to see his phone history and finally he let me see it while keeping his phone a safe distance away from me so he could easily pull it away. I noticed that he had watched porn that same morning. He had been watching porn every single day since I’ve been here. I asked him if I could see his phone and he was so adversed to the idea, but eventually after literally begging and saying I would leave (which I was really about to do), I got it from him for a couple of minutes and I could see what he was looking up. He was on forums looking for specific women to see naked and responding to other people looking for certain women from social media. Finally, I got it out of him that he has a problem. He admitted has an addiction and it has nothing to do with his attraction towards me or his love towards me. 

I feel so betrayed. I feel ugly and I’ve been feeling ugly. He knows that I’ve been so depressed about this, but the fact that he knew I felt this way and continued to engage in this behaviour and avoid intimacy with me makes me feel sick to my stomach. I’m trying to make this work and so is he apparently. 

Last night, I asked him if I could see his phone search history again and he refused and said that’s where he draws the line because knowing what his porn searches were is private. He claims it is because he is embarrassed. He said to me that the next morning we can start fresh and I can have his phone password and look through anytime I want. Fast-forward the next day he has deleted all of his phone search history. I asked him to see it today and he was incredibly reluctant again. He pulled the phone away from me a couple of times, eventually, I was able to look at it and I hadn’t found anything, but I know that it’s very likely he had looked at porn today and had deleted that history. There was something he was obviously hiding from me because he wouldn’t have been pulling it away from me and terrified that I was looking at it. 

I’ve been incredibly upset and crying over the past few days, going through emotional ups and downs, snapping at him, breaking down and asking questions and begging for answers which he typically responds with the same answers “I don’t know”, “we’ve already talked about this”, or “you’re not listening to me”. I have no trust in him. I am constantly policing him and asking him what he’s looking at on his phone/asking if he’s looking at porn. If I look over his shoulder, he gets very frustrated with me and he says that this is just too much for him, that he feels emasculated, and that we’ve been over this, that it’s just porn and not like he’s cheating, that I’m taking this too far, and a couple of times told that I need to leave. A couple of minutes later, he’ll come to me and hug me and he’ll say he’s sorry and that he’s really ready to make changes. We had sex which I essentially begged for because I wanted to see if he desired me like he said he does, and he did orgasm. When I am crying and asking him what these other girls have that I don’t, and if he is attracted to me, he will say “yes obviously, we just had sex!”, as if the past few months we haven’t had a completely dead bedroom.

I have been spending the past couple of days watching YouTube videos researching up on the addiction, but he says that he doesn’t need any of that because he’s had addictions before and he’s had success with them quitting cold turkey. I told him that he should be putting in this work for me and for the sake of me being able to trust him. he takes his phone with him everywhere he goes pretty much, the shower, the bathroom, and he’s on it constantly. He often angles it away from me and he’s very secretive with it. Is there any hope or am I wasting my time? we both love each other very much, but I feel like I’ve definitely been put on the back burner and I don’t see him taking any real initiative or steps toward me being able to trust him again.

I should also mention that he never really says much when I’d send him sexy pics. I will dress up in lingerie and he will show virtually no interest. I’m an attractive woman, but it seems like he would prefer the variety of other women he has stored in his hidden iPhone files (which included women he has previously slept with).",7,1733669505.0,loveafterporn,7,1.0,False

I spoke to my partner because she works on a bar  at a holiday camp which I use to work but she wasn't giving any hours up to compromise my new hours. Ok I thought and started looking for alternatives I swapped shift with other co-workers but one day he turned around and said you can't do that anymore so from then on I was screwed so my partner suggested I return to the place she currently works at so I thought worth a try I mean I left on good terms, so I spoke to my old boss and he said loin skip the interviews and becoming a waiter again (which BTW was a pay cut) and join us straight as a supervisor of the restaurant and we will work both yours and your partners hours I thought "" great doesn't effect her hours and I'm in a position I wanted to be before I left"" all was great for about 1year then it all went down hill from hear

My partner was offered the same supervisor position but on bar so different department I explained will that effect my hours as I'm already getting home for 430pm and she's already waiting at the door to leave (so we're like passing ships)....she assured me that it wouldn't, well that was a lie because as soon as she started they wanted her in early which meant the kids would be on there own until I got home which at the time one was 9 yrs old and the other 5 yrs old....so it was suggested I move departments to coffee shop which the shifts end at 4pm so it was a rush and alot of pressure to get home in time for her to leave (I HATED COFFEE SHOP) really wasn't where I wanted to be but I thought of we both get to work then it's something I have to do.

So about another year had passed and I'm depressed sounds silly but not seeing my partner regularly and a job I hate really got me down so I spoke to her about this but told me I'm being silly.....so about another year had past and this was the breaking point for me I couldn't go on anymore it wad really effecting me i suggested maybe she drops from 40hrs down to 30 this will mean we will get to see more of each other and less pressure for me to get home, do dinner, tidying school lunches and bed routines but no she wasn't willing to compromise at all 

So another position comes up at my place on the maintenance team soothing I've done before and really loved 😍 great this is the break I need for both of us but there was a catch.....there was a team of 4 and we all had to chip in on late shift (until 7pm) which was fair and only about 2 days a week we would have to do this so I spoke to my partner about this, she said ""it will be fine"" I suggested her 2 days off are my two late shift she said ""maybe"" i needed a yes or a no as the job was advertised across work and public she said yep do it if it makes you happy......So it caused arguments for a while until I spoke to my boss and said really sorry looks like I'm going to have to quit due to hours amend he already knew about my partner being selfish and willing to leave our girls home alone so she gets to work on time.....(yeah he doesn't mix his words) this made me realise maybe it is her being selfish? He suggested he will speak to the other lads and if there happy I can to 8am until 4pm which meant if my partner changed her shifts to 5pm until 12pm like she used to I wouldn't have pressure to get home in time before she just left them alone until I got home (I bike btw)
So I thought all my Christmas came at once this would be perfect so I spoke my partner again and she said yes we will trial it ..All worked great until she started getting roated in a 345pm and day shift (her brother sorts rotas out BTW he's her manager) so I said is there no way you can do 5pm until 12pm but no she's not willing to but ill put the youngest (now 8yrs old) in after school club and th eldest (12 yrs old) will come home form high school amd sit there until I get home I thought we'll there's no other choice...So now I have to ensure I leave dead on 4pm to get to the school for quarter past 4 which it takes me 20mins to get there so teachers always moans at me I'm late....once I've got youngest I rush home to get dinner done tidy and clean the home (because she works late she gets up and 2pm and to tired to do anything) then do school lunches ensure there showered and pj on and go to bed at allocated time all after a 8/9 hour shift 
I was in hospital once for a week after getting meningitis and pneumonia on the lungs the day I got home she said I'm needed at work tonight and left so I had to do everything again whilst exhausted and in pain.....even on days off she's constantly sorting orders for work, emailing people or covering shift ( there's 3 other supervisors BTW) that could be doing this so days off aren't really days off 
One more thing I was really late from work once and my phone broke so I couldn't tell her I'm going to be abit late to my surprise when I got home it was just the kids there! I asked where mum is and they said she left for work ages ago I called her off my 13yr old mobile and said I could of been hit by a car and in hospital right now you wouldn't og known and just left the girls alone 
She constantly argues with me because she thinks I call her a bad mum which I don't I explain she has her priorities out of place and we will feel secound best to work!......so I said if it doesn't change I'm leaving she replied go then I said you wouldn't be able to work as I can't sit up until 12/ 1 am then get up at 630am to go to my job shensaid ""I'll quit then and you'll see the k8ds kn my terms"" i said we couldn't afford for you not to work but if you just compromised amd changed hours like I have we will be OK she said nope not doing that.....I left amd she messaged me if I can stay over this weekend to basically look after the girls so she can surprise surprise work I said yes because I didn't want her to leave this kids..I moved back in after a week because I was scared shell just take the girls off me when i got back she laughed and mocked me because I was unpacking my suitcase while the girls where at school (told them I had a work conference so they wasn't aware)   nothing is changed I'm tired all the time I booked her birthday off made it special but she worked mine and slept all day though it so I ended up taking the girls to the park

Prologue: Jacky's Redemption and Callia's Shock
https://i.imgur.com/4hzRWCM.jpeg

A year earlier, “Jacky” Stone was a different man. The bar was dimly lit, the air thick with the smell of spilled beer and stale cigarettes.  sat at the counter, nursing his fifth—or was it his sixth?—glass of whiskey. His massive frame hunched over the drink, his blue eyes dark as the lake he grew up near, staring into the amber liquid as though it held the answers to questions he didn’t dare ask.

When the shove came, it wasn’t unexpected. Bars like this always had someone looking for trouble, and Jacky’s size made him a magnet for insecure tough guys who wanted to prove themselves. Normally, he’d shrug it off.  hated violence when he was sober. But tonight, he wasn’t sober.

“You gonna move, big guy?” the man sneered, his smaller frame puffed up like a rooster in a barnyard.he sighed, setting down his glass. “You don’t want this,” he said softly, his voice rumbling like distant thunder.

But the man wanted it. And so did his six friends.

What followed was chaos. wasn’t just big; he was fast, a mountain that moved like a storm. Growing up as white boy in the ghetto, he’d learned to fight young—it was a skill you needed when the world didn’t give you much choice. His punches landed like sledgehammers, his movements calculated and relentless. Blood spilled—some his, mostly theirs—until the bar was a wreck and stood alone, panting, a predator surrounded by fallen prey.


The cops arrived, weapons drawn, shouting commands. turned slowly, his face a grotesque mix of blood and a crooked, open-mouthed smile. He dropped to his knees, raising his hands. The fight was over.


Prison was the next chapter, but even there, made an impact. His time behind bars was short—six months, reduced for good behavior—but it wasn’t wasted. He reorganized the jail’s chaotic cell system, rebuilt the crumbling library shelves, and donated his own money to replace the jail’s outdated books and supplies.


When the photo of presenting a $500,000 check to the six men he had beaten went public, it made waves. He promised to pay their hospital bills and provide ongoing support for their recovery. The gesture stunned everyone. The donation to the jail, the thoughtful reorganization of its resources, and his commitment to sobriety earned him the respect of the community—and the attention of one

Callia’s Prologue: Coffee and Confusion
Callia sipped her coffee slowly, enjoying the quiet of her morning. Her small art studio was bathed in soft light, brushes and canvases scattered around the space like a colorful explosion. She had just finished grading a stack of papers from her elementary school art students when her phone buzzed.
It was a news alert.


Curious, she clicked on it—and promptly spit her coffee all over her sketchbook.


“Jacky?!”


The headline read: “Local Giant Turns Over New Leaf: From Bar Brawl to Redemption.” There he was, her best friend since childhood, towering in the center of a photo, handing over a check to the men he had nearly destroyed months earlier. His expression was subdued, almost shy, but his eyes carried that familiar spark she hadn’t seen in years.

Callia couldn’t help but laugh, a mix of exasperation and affection bubbling to the surface. Typical Jacky. Even when he screwed up, he somehow found a way to make it right—and make a scene doing it.

She read the article twice, her mind swirling with memories. had always been larger than life, not just in size but in heart. They’d drifted apart over the years, life pulling them in different directions, but the bond between them never fully faded. Seeing him now, after all this time, brought a flood of emotions she wasn’t ready to unpack.

She grabbed her phone, her fingers hovering over his contact. She hadn’t spoken to him in months, years, maybe longer. What could she even say? Before she could decide, her phone buzzed again—a text from him.
`Jacky: ""Hey, Cal. Are you busy?""
Callia stared at the message, her heart pounding. She didn’t know what he wanted, but she had a feeling life was about to get a lot more interesting.
Callia: ""Depends. Are you about to talk me into something crazy?""
His reply came almost instantly.
Jacky: ""Always.""

Chapter 1: Seeds of the Past
The quiet hum of Jacky’s ancient laptop filled the cramped Milwaukee apartment as he reread the email Callia had sent the night before. It was simple, even friendly—like so many messages they had exchanged over the years. Yet, there was something unspoken in her words, a crack in her normally unshakable exterior.

“Hey, Jacky,That sounds great, Been thinking about you a lot lately. We should catch up. Call me when you can.—Callia”

 Leaned back in his chair, the springs groaning under his weight. His arms stretched wide and muscles made the shirt tight around his skin. He absentmindedly scratched his goatee, eyes drifting to the photo pinned above his desk—a snapshot of him and Callia on a summer day, barefoot at the river. Her smile had been as radiant as the sun that day, but it was her eyes he couldn’t forget: green like gemstone pools.

The years had been unkind to him. At thirty-nine, his body carried the scars of a lifetime’s worth of battles—most of them fought against himself. The fainting spells had worsened. The hallucinations were harder to shake. And the truth, which he rarely voiced, was becoming impossible to ignore: his time was running out.

Still, the thought of seeing Callia made his chest tighten. She was always a whirlwind, a storm in human form—bursting into his life with color and chaos, leaving behind a mess of feelings he’d never quite sorted through. She was the one that got away in every way that Mattered. And she was also his best friend, the only person who had ever truly seen him.

His phone buzzed, snapping him back to the present. It was Callia.

“Hey, Jacky!” Her voice was as lively as ever, though he caught the slight hesitation beneath it.“Callia,” he replied, leaning forward. “What’s up?”“Not much. Just… I don’t know. I Need to hear your voice, I guess.”

That was how it always started with them—some vague excuse, a half-explained reason, until the truth finally bubbled to the surface. He waited.

“You know, I was thinking,” she continued. “Remember those road trips we used to dream about? Just you and me, no destination, no plans?” Chuckled. “Yeah. I remember you saying we’d end up broke and stranded in the middle of nowhere.”“Well, I think it’s time we found out.”

The words hung in the air. For a moment, wasn’t sure he’d heard her right.

“You’re serious?” he asked.“As serious as I can be,” she said, her voice softening. “I need this, Jacky. We need this.”

He leaned back again, the springs groaning in protest. It wasn’t just about the trip. It never was with Callia. There was something behind her words, a plea she wasn’t saying outright.

“I don’t know, Callia,” he said after a moment. “It’s been years since we’ve done anything like that. You’ve got Micah, your job—”“That’s the thing,” she interrupted. “Micah’s fine with it. He knows how much you mean to me. And work… I just need a break. From everything.”

She didn’t elaborate, but she didn’t have to. knew Callia well enough to hear the strain in her voice. He thought of all the times she had been there for him—when his first dog, Duke, died; when his marriage crumbled; when his health began to fail. She had always shown up, no questions asked.

“Okay,” he said finally.“Okay?” she echoed, surprise laced with relief.“Yeah. Let’s do it. Just tell me when and where.”

She laughed, the sound like a warm breeze cutting through the heaviness of the moment. “You won’t regret it, Jacky. I promise.”

As the call ended, stared at the photo on his desk again. For the first time in years, a flicker of excitement stirred in his chest.

He didn’t know where the road would take them, but he knew one thing for sure: it was a journey he couldn’t afford to miss.

Chapter 2: A Reluctant Yes
The rhythmic tapping of Callia’s ukulele filled the small, sunlit condo as she plucked aimlessly at the strings. Halyi, her aging Golden Retriever, lay sprawled on the carpet, snoring softly. Callia’s mind wasn’t on music, though. It was racing, tumbling through memories and second-guessing her own impulsiveness.

Author's Foreword

As a writer, I’ve always believed that stories are more than just words on a page—they are vessels of emotion, connection, and the complex, often messy, journey of life. This story is no exception. It’s a reflection on love, loss, and the inexplicable ways in which the past and present collide.
The relationship between Callia and Jacky was built on years of friendship, unspoken feelings, and shared memories. But at its core, it was always about resilience—both in the face of their own challenges and in how they navigated the twists and turns of life together. Their bond is something I’ve always found inspiring, and writing about it allowed me to explore not just the beauty of a deep connection, but also the heavy burden of unexpressed love and the healing power of time.
As the story unfolds, it becomes more than just a love story. It’s a testament to the complexity of human relationships and how, sometimes, the most meaningful connections defy time and even death. What I hope readers will take away from this is that love never truly fades; it changes shape, evolves, and finds ways to remain present in our lives, even when we least expect it.
This book wouldn’t exist without the characters who breathed life into it. Callia’s strength and vulnerability, Jacky’s charm and loyalty—these two characters have been with me from the start, and I hope they find a place in your heart as they did in mine. Their journey was never meant to be easy, but it was always meant to be worth it.
To everyone who’s ever loved, lost, or struggled to make sense of the forces that shape their lives—this story is for you. It’s a reminder that the people we care about never truly leave us. They may change form, but they stay with us in ways we never expect. I hope you enjoy reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it.

Context below:

I am a white M31 and my significant other is a black F26.  We are moving to the area from Kentucky as she will be attending either Northwestern Medicine's radiography program or Malcolm X's radiography program this coming summer.  We would like to be in a ""quieter"" more residential area so as to be able to get away from the hustle and bustle when we please.  As well as being able to walk around and feel safe after hours.  Being within walking distance of grocery stores, markets and a gym would be nice too.  We have two dogs, so not living in a high rise would be ideal and more of a 3 or 4 unit home would be our preference if possible.  We have explored the following options and are leaning towards Wicker Park/Bucktown thus far (Wicker Park, Bucktown, Wrigleyville, Lake View East).  We were told that Lincoln Park could be a good fit as well as Old Town by some locals who we have befriended over our several trips to the area.  We aren't massive on nightlife/bars/drinking, but do enjoy to go see live music, eat at good restaurants and coffee shops on the weekends.  We also enjoy sporting events but can get to any of those quite easily with public transit.  When it comes to price point I can spend up to, but no more than, $3000 a month on living accomodations.

Any and all insight from the local community would be incredible as I want to make sure that my SO feels as comfortable as possible during this transition. ",0,1733668762.0,AskChicago,7,0.15,False

So when I was a kid, my mother, my sister & I all moved out to Hawaii to see my mother's friend that lived out there. We packed our things & headed to the tropical paradise. While sitting on the plane, my mother had all of our money we were gonna use to start our lives out there in the form of cashiers checks, in her zipped up wallet, in the bottom of her carry on. We landed, we were all pretty tired from the flight, so we thought we'd go get some coffee at the airport. We walk for a bit, then we see a big round table outside of a coffee shop & my mother starts frantically looking through her carry on & then dumps the contents out onto the table we were all sitting at. The money was GONE. To this day, we never recovered the money & have no idea how someone was able to steal it. 

That's story one. 

Story two. 

We've been living in Hawaii for about a year or so at this point. We ended up moving in with my mother's friend, due to all our money getting stolen on the flight there. 
My sister & I absolutely loved walking around the dried lava fields, exploring the caves that it would form. We were so adventurous, we would walk around everywhere. We didn't even wear shoes, no one really does over there.
So, on one of our fun adventures, we stop at this field with very tall grass/weeds. We stop for a second & take in the sight of just how beautiful everything was, when all of a sudden we see this top hat bouncing in & out of sight on the top of the grass/weeds. In front of whatever we were seeing were two ferrets, one white, one black. We were stunned.. we had no idea what we were witnessing. We run back to the house to tell our mother what happened. 
Back then, my mother was an avid listener of a very popular radio show called NPR. Seeing what this subreddit is about, y'all probably know what it is or most likely at least heard of it. 
We were all laying down, ready to go to bed. As we were telling our mother what we saw just a couple hours before, NPR is quietly playing the background. We hear someone call in & they tell the host something they saw that day & they explained to a T, exactly what my sister & I saw earlier. We all couldn't believe it. We all instantly thought, ""no wayyyy"", but nope, it was real.

1h9k69a,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollapseSupport/comments/1h9k69a/how_do_you_personally_communicate_the_issue_of/,"How do you, personally, communicate the issue of collapse?","For about a decade now, I've known about the potential for collapse and existential risks to humanity. In all that time I've felt inspired to speak out about it but never did in any sort of substantial way until one day I realized I and everybody I know will be dead and gone at some point, forever and ever and ever. I let it sink in that today will eventually have been hundreds/thousands/millions/billions of years ago. So it helped to ease any apprehension I had about how messy and inarticulate I might be and just go for it, in spite of the petty judgements people might make about it. In fact I've kind of let myself go in how I emote, and I fear I'm beginning to verge on tacky rather than tactful. I also think my writing is rigid and awkward. But at least I feel like I'm living my life with integrity getting real about really important issues. Though while it's helped me to process things, I do aim to be effective in my approach. So I was wondering what, if any, talking points you all use when addressing these issues, or if you had any examples of things you've said or posted, so that I might gleam your style or tweak my own. Below I've provided a couple examples of things I've posted. While it is mentioned that I ""don't care"" about how I come off, I am curious of what anyone's impression might be. I hate that some people apparently think I'm just trying to sound deep and cultured, making ""profound"" statements like we should do better and fight for a better world. But I've gotten used to how snarky people on Reddit can be and I think it's time to see in what ways I might alter my cadence, regardless of how it makes me feel. And I'd like to see what you all say, or would say, if you could say what you really want to say. 

Below are a couple of posts I've made, one from the thanksgiving, and the other more recently, which I attached screenshots to, detailing wealth disparity in America, world poverty rates, population growth, the increase in global temperature, the sixth mass extinction, insect population decline, water scarcity, plastic pollution, soil degradation, and a reference to the doomsday clock as well as the recent study showing that we're ""just 0.01% of all life but have destroyed 83% of wild mammals.

Things I'm thankful for: 
 
Not having to hunt and skin a turkey.
Not having to grow and harvest the rest of the food.
Having all the spices to make the food yummy.
Medical advancements keeping friends and family in check.
Technological advancements providing heated/air conditioned shelter and music and TV, and communication devices.
Transportation to get all that food (no horse and carriage for me thanks)
Clothes to wear.
Hot showers.
Cozy beds.
Good job, friends and family. 
Nice weather.
Coffee.
Not dealing with the threat of war against MY home country or a pandemic that still very much exists or incoming storms or civil unrest or crop failures or an overheating, acidic ocean swimming around in murky darkness starved and hoping not to get eaten, or in the wilderness in pitch black night getting bitten by bugs sleeping on the ground having a snake slither all up on me -- eek! Or in a dusty dank cave, yuk. Or in the anthropocene or sixth mass extinction ... Oh wait. 
And I'm thankful to be so secure in myself despite how insufferable I appear, and on the right side of history. Happy Thanksgiving!
 
And then more recently:

""Why do you rant so relentlessly about how we should focus on taking care of each other and the planet instead of remaining disconnected from reality on the reg (my name)?"" Ohh I don't know, maybe because it's our one and only home, or because I want my nieces to have a bright future ahead of them, or anyone else that could have been me or you being born down the line. Maybe it has to do with the fact that my guess is in order to hold those in power accountable, perhaps we need to hold each other accountable. Maybe it has to do with the fact that if you enjoy your standard of living and don't wanna worry about how crazy the world is, we'll have to partake in some sort of discourse about it eventually. Oh, I don't know, maybe I'm just getting ahead of all of you in updating your own Facebook status to look the same one day, not too far along into the future (my guess is something along the lines of ""I'm not gonna lie you guys, I'm kind of scared"" followed by worthless platitudes in your comments about how things will be alright, humanity will find a way, God will be there for us, or we'll be there for each other. *Someway, somehow* Hmmm I wonder what those ways and hows look like, is maybe what I'm thinking before the fact). Maybe I understand ""too late"" exists and I don't enjoy living on a planet where life is about getting a job participating in, once again, an *unsustainable* economic system, in a country using two Earth's worth of resources, supporting the habits of a gluttonous bunch that doesn't even understand how fortunate they are (through no real fault of their own). Maybe it's because I like the idea of everyone leading fulfilling lives doing things of meaning, that don't amount to enriching an already disgustingly rich few. Maybe it's because it's pretty damn silly that nations across the world decided they owned land and its resources based on their histories, as if we didn't all just pop into existence, as though ... It belongs to all of us. But not just us, because it shouldn't be alllllll about us, given the fact we could have just as well have been born one of these other life forms. Maybe it's ok to check in about it, regardless of how it makes you feel, or how ineffective we are in responding, because that's hopefully a part of helping people to ~understand~ these sides to reality we're disconnected from, instead of not thinking about it, let alone talking about it. 

Because THAT'S what life is about: whatever is happening in it. And right now it would seem we're living a dream, with all sorts of opportunities and resources at our disposal, and all sorts of knowledge and tech to put forth towards accomplishing things of greater value than more of the same which, whattayaknow, KEEPS US DISCONNECTED FROM REALITY. And insulated from nature for only so long. Yeah I care enough to post about it LMAO get the heck outta here with y'alls dismissiveness, I will surely talk about it. 

I am not a public speaker and I don't care to try to be, or to charm anyone. I'm obviously going through it, just as I have been silently the last decade, but ya learn not to care about what anyone has to think about how outspoken you are when you realize what's on the line when we keep remaining silent, and don't even think about trying, which is a choice, and an ugly one at that. I myself am surrounded by all this stimulus living my life trying to just do my thing, but I can only continue forward on that path (a hopefully good one) so long as the world around me doesn't start messing with my plans, and the same goes for you. 

So take a gander, and do try to understand there is hope ... And a better amount of it to let these things in and challenge yourself to be of the mind that in the long run, closing yourself off and trying to tune it all out isn't going to work, help yourself, or anyone else. That said I want you to be mindful of the fact that there is a lot of good and beauty and promise in this world, and we are a lovely people at the end of the day, at heart. And yeah, I love you, because I know you. I don't need to know you to know I know you, and to love you, because I'm just like you, and I know what you're going through as a human being. I don't need to know you to learn to tolerate and appreciate you. I care enough to try and help my family, which you bloody well are no matter how distant, and I hope you understand that's another reason why I put myself out there regardless of how messy I am. Because I am you, and you are me, too. Believe it or not, we are not separate from the universe, we are a part of it, and one in the same, and there's more to this than just the transient experience of life as a human circa 2024. We have a legacy to uphold and suffering is not where it's at. So how bout that.

That's the moment I live for. After a decade of camping adventures - from disastrous first trips in bargain-bin tents to perfecting my setup in the backcountry - I've learned that your tent isn't just gear, it's your home in the wilderness. Today, I'm excited to share everything I've discovered about choosing the perfect camping tent, sprinkled with plenty of real-world stories and hard-won wisdom. Grab a coffee (or your favorite camp beverage), and let's dive in! ☕

# The Rising Magic of Tent Life 🌲

Let me paint you a picture of what's happening in the outdoor world right now. More people than ever are trading their comfortable beds for sleeping bags and their Netflix queues for starlit skies. And you know what? It makes my heart sing. In a world where we're all constantly connected to our devices, there's something profoundly healing about disconnecting and reconnecting with nature.

I remember my first camping trip like it was yesterday. Armed with a $30 tent from a big box store and more enthusiasm than experience, I headed into the wilderness. That night, a gentle spring rain turned into an unexpected downpour, and let's just say my ""waterproof"" tent had a different definition of waterproof than I did! 😅 But even with soggy sleeping bags and dampened spirits, I was hooked. The sound of rain on tent fabric, the fresh mountain air, the sense of adventure - it was all intoxicating.

# Understanding Tent Types (From Someone Who's Tried Them All!) 🎪

After years of trial and error (emphasis on the error), I've had the chance to experience pretty much every type of tent out there. Let me break them down in a way that actually makes sense:

**A-frame/Ridge Tents** Think of these as the OG of camping tents. They're the triangular ones that look like the tents you drew in kindergarten. While they might seem old-school, they hold a special place in my heart. My dad's ancient A-frame was my first introduction to camping, and its simplicity is still appealing. Perfect for solo adventures or minimalist camping.

**Dome Tents** Ah, my trusty companions! Dome tents are like that reliable friend who's always got your back. Their curved design handles wind beautifully - I once watched my dome tent shrug off 40mph gusts while other tents around our campsite folded like origami. They're incredibly versatile and my go-to recommendation for most campers.

**Tunnel Tents** These beauties are the RVs of the tent world. Last summer, I took my extended family camping, and our tunnel tent became the unofficial community center of our campsite. The long, cylindrical design creates amazing living space. Fair warning though - they need proper guying out in wind (learned that lesson the hard way in Yellowstone!).

**Geodesic Tents** Picture a dome tent that hit the gym! These are the hardcore mountaineering shelters that laugh in the face of storms. When I started winter camping, my geodesic tent literally saved my bacon during an unexpected blizzard in the Rockies. They're overkill for most campers, but if you're heading into serious conditions, nothing else compares.

**Cabin Tents** The glampers' delight! Last family reunion, we set up a cabin tent as our ""living room,"" and it was glorious. Near-vertical walls mean you can actually stand up straight - a luxury you don't appreciate until you've spent a week hunching in a backpacking tent. They're heavy and take some time to set up, but for comfort camping? *chef's kiss*

# The Real Talk About Choosing Your Tent 📋

Let me share something that took me years to figure out - there's no such thing as a perfect tent, only the perfect tent for your needs. Here's my comprehensive comparison table based on countless nights under canvas:

|Factor|Why It Matters|Real-World Impact|My Personal Experience|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Seasonality|Determines when you can camp safely|3-season tents work for 90% of campers|My 4-season tent saved me in an unexpected snowstorm, but it's overkill most of the time|
|Size/Capacity|Comfort and livability|Manufacturer capacity ratings are optimistic|Always go one person larger than you think you need - your gear needs space too!|
|Weight|Affects portability|Critical for backpacking, less so for car camping|My back still remembers carrying that 8-pound tent 15 miles...|
|Material|Durability and longevity|Better materials = longer life|Investing in quality fabric saved me hundreds in replacement costs|
|Setup Ease|Real impact on your camping experience|Crucial when setting up in dark/rain|Nothing worse than complicated poles at midnight in a storm|

# A Tale of Two Storms (Or Why Your Tent Choice Really Matters) 📖

Let me tell you about the night that changed my whole perspective on tent quality. It was last August in the Rockies, around 11,000 feet. The forecast was clear (rookie mistake trusting mountain weather), but around midnight, all hell broke loose. The storm that rolled in was something straight out of a weather channel highlight reel.

I was in my REI Base Camp 4, and my buddy was in his budget tent from a big box store. As the wind howled and rain pounded, I lay there dry and secure, watching my tent flex and hold. Meanwhile, my friend's tent... well, let's just say he spent most of the night in my vestibule after his tent quite literally folded in half.

The next morning, looking at the campground was like surveying a tent graveyard. Broken poles, ripped fabric, and defeated campers packing up wet gear. But there stood my Base Camp, proud and dry. That's when I realized - a tent isn't just about having a place to sleep, it's about having a reliable shelter when nature decides to remind you who's boss.

# Fascinating Facts About Modern Camping 🤓

Let me share some stats that really opened my eyes about how camping has evolved:

* The average first-time camper spends $128.26 on gear (though I'd recommend investing a bit more in your tent)
* Tents remain the most popular choice for outdoor shelter, beating out RVs and hammocks
* Tent campers typically stay out 2.5 nights per trip (though I find once you have a comfortable setup, you'll want to stay longer!)

# Pro Tips from Someone Who's Made All the Mistakes 🔧

After countless nights under canvas, here are my top tips for getting the most out of your tent:

**Setting Up**

* Always do a test setup at home first
* Practice setting up in the dark (you'll thank me later)
* Bring extra stakes and guy lines - always

**Maintenance**

* Never, ever pack away a wet tent (my first tent's mold garden taught me this)
* Clean your zippers after every trip (sand is the enemy!)
* Re-waterproof seams annually
* Store loosely in a dry place

**Smart Additions**

* A good footprint is worth its weight in gold
* Seam sealer is your best friend
* Carry repair tape for emergency fixes

# The Heart of the Matter ❤️

You know what's beautiful about camping? It's not just about the gear or even the destination. It's about those moments when you're zipped up in your tent, listening to the wind in the trees, feeling completely present in the world. A good tent isn't just shelter - it's your gateway to these experiences.

Whether you're a first-time camper dreaming of starlit nights or a seasoned backpacker looking to upgrade your setup, remember this: the best tent is the one that gives you the confidence to get out there and explore. Because at the end of the day, that's what it's all about - having adventures, making memories, and experiencing the raw beauty of the natural world.

I'd love to hear about your tent experiences and answer any questions you might have! Drop your stories in the comments below - there's nothing I enjoy more than swapping camp tales with fellow outdoor enthusiasts. 🌟",1,1733668647.0,OutdoorGearHub,0,1.0,False

So when I was a kid, my mother, my sister & I all moved out to Hawaii to see my mother's friend that lived out there. We packed our things & headed to the tropical paradise. While sitting on the plane, my mother had all of our money we were gonna use to start our lives out there in the form of cashiers checks, in her zipped up wallet, in the bottom of her carry on. We landed, we were all pretty tired from the flight, so we thought we'd go get some coffee at the airport. We walk for a bit, then we see a big round table outside of a coffee shop & my mother starts frantically looking through her carry on & then dumps the contents out onto the table we were all sitting at. The money was GONE. To this day, we never recovered the money & have no idea how someone was able to steal it. 

That's story one. 

Story two. 

We've been living in Hawaii for about a year or so at this point. We ended up moving in with my mother's friend, due to all our money getting stolen on the flight there. 
My sister & I absolutely loved walking around the dried lava fields, exploring the caves that it would form. We were so adventurous, we would walk around everywhere. We didn't even wear shoes, no one really does over there.
So, on one of our fun adventures, we stop at this field with very tall grass/weeds. We stop for a second & take in the sight of just how beautiful everything was, when all of a sudden we see this top hat bouncing in & out of sight on the top of the grass/weeds. In front of whatever we were seeing were two ferrets, one white, one black. We were stunned.. we had no idea what we were witnessing. We run back to the house to tell our mother what happened. 
Back then, my mother was an avid listener of a very popular radio show called NPR. Seeing what this subreddit is about, y'all probably know what it is or most likely at least heard of it. 
We were all laying down, ready to go to bed. As we were telling our mother what we saw just a couple hours before, NPR is quietly playing the background. We hear someone call in & they tell the host something they saw that day & they explained to a T, exactly what my sister & I saw earlier. We all couldn't believe it. We all instantly thought, ""no wayyyy"", but nope, it was real. 
Man, just thinking back on this story is giving me goosebumps..",1,1733668557.0,ParanormalEncounters,0,1.0,False
1h9k38c,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutdoorGearHub/comments/1h9k38c/best_hiking_backpack_a_love_letter_to_1000_miles/,Best Hiking Backpack - A Love Letter to 1000+ Miles of Adventure 🎒,"Grab a cup of coffee (or your favorite trail drink), get comfy, and let me share something deeply personal with you. After logging over 1,000 miles on trails from the misty peaks of the Appalachian Mountains to the sun-baked ridges of the Pacific Crest Trail, I've developed what you might call an obsessive relationship with hiking backpacks. Trust me, my journey to finding the perfect pack has been anything but straight – it's been more like one of those switchback trails that keeps you guessing until the very end!

# A Painful (Literally!) Beginning 🤕

Picture this: It's 2022, and there I am, standing at the trailhead of my first major Appalachian Trail section hike, proudly wearing a $40 backpack I snagged from a clearance sale. *""How different can backpacks really be?""* I remember thinking, full of that beautiful beginner's naivety. Oh, sweet summer child...

Three days later, I was hobbling down the trail with shoulders that felt like they'd been through a meat grinder and hips sporting bruises in fascinating shades of purple I didn't even know existed. That cheap pack had taught me an expensive lesson: your backpack isn't just gear – it's your most intimate trail companion, the one piece of equipment that can make the difference between ""I'm living my best life!"" and ""Someone please airlift me out of here!""

# The Three-Act Play of Hiking Backpacks 🎭

After that humbling experience, I dove deep into understanding backpack types. Let me break them down in a way that actually makes sense:

# Act 1: Daypacks (10-25 liters)

Think of these as your trail-running shoes of backpacks. They're light, nimble, and perfect for those ""I just need the essentials"" kind of days. **I use my 20L daypack for quick summit attempts and those magical sunrise hikes where all you need is water, snacks, and a camera to capture the moment.**

# Act 2: Weekend Warriors (30-50 liters)

This is where things get serious, but not too serious. These packs are like that perfect pair of hiking boots – capable enough for a solid adventure but won't make you feel like you're training for an expedition. *I've found this size to be my sweet spot for 90% of my adventures.*

# Act 3: Multi-day Monsters (50+ liters)

Welcome to the big leagues! These are the packs you reach for when someone says ""Hey, want to spend two weeks in the backcountry?"" They're like having a tiny house on your back, which can be either amazing or terrifying, depending on how you pack.

# The Science Behind Comfort: Features That Actually Matter 🔬

After testing more packs than I care to admit (my gear closet looks like a backpack graveyard), here's what I've learned matters most:

|Feature|Why It's Crucial|Personal Trail Tale|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Fit & Comfort|Makes the difference between singing on trail and crying behind a tree|Found my holy grail after discovering my torso is ""uniquely proportioned"" (code for weird)|
|Weight|Every ounce feels like a pound by mile 15|Once carried a 6-pound empty pack. Never. Again.|
|Durability|Because duct tape can't fix everything|Current pack has survived 2 falls, 3 rainstorms, and one angry raccoon|
|Organization|Prevents the dreaded ""it's somewhere in here"" trail dance|Multiple access points saved my sanity during a week-long rainstorm|
|Ventilation|Because back sweat is real|Learned this the hard way in Georgia summer humidity|

# The Elite Five: My Top Picks (Trail-Tested and Back-Approved) ⭐

1. **Osprey Kestrel 38** ($165)
   * *The jack-of-all-trades master*
   * What I love: Perfect balance of weight and features
   * What could be better: Side pockets could be stretchier
   * Trail story: This pack survived a surprise snowstorm with me in the Whites, keeping my gear dry when everything else was soaked
2. **Deuter Aircontact Ultra 35+5** ($220)
   * *The comfort queen/king*
   * What I love: Feels like it's giving you a gentle hug
   * What could be better: A bit heavy for its size
   * Trail story: Carried this through a 3-day downpour in the Smokies, and it kept my spirits high when everything else was trying to bring me down
3. **Mystery Ranch Radix 57** ($289)
   * *The gear-hauling beast*
   * What I love: Built like a tank but carries like a dream
   * What could be better: Price tag makes my wallet cry
   * Trail story: This was my trusty companion on a 2-week trek where I definitely overpacked (who needs three paperbacks anyway?)
4. **Sierra Designs Flex Capacitor 40-60** ($199)
   * *The transformer*
   * What I love: Expandable design is pure genius
   * What could be better: Learning curve on adjustment system
   * Trail story: Perfect for a trip where I started with full winter gear and ended in summer conditions
5. **Black Diamond Betalight 45** ($180)
   * *The minimalist's dream*
   * What I love: Surprisingly roomy for how light it is
   * What could be better: Limited padding
   * Trail story: My go-to for fast-and-light missions where every ounce counts

# The Art of Packing (Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Organization) 📦

Let me share a story that changed how I pack forever. Picture this: Day three on the PCT, reaching for my headlamp as darkness falls, only to realize it's somewhere in the bottomless pit of my poorly packed bag. After emptying my entire pack on the trail (while using my phone's flashlight), I developed this foolproof system:

# The Layer Cake Method:

* **Bottom Layer:** Sleeping bag, sleeping pad, camp clothes (things you only need at camp)
* **Core Layer:** Heavy items like food, cooking gear, and water reservoir (keeps your center of gravity stable)
* **Top Layer:** Rain gear, first aid kit, snacks (quick-access items)
* **Brain/Lid:** Map, headlamp, sunscreen (essentials you need throughout the day)

# Backpack Care 101: Lessons from a Reformed Gear Abuser 🧹

I used to be terrible at gear maintenance. Like, ""throw the muddy pack in the garage and deal with it next season"" terrible. Then I destroyed an expensive pack due to mold (RIP), and now I'm almost obsessive about care:

# The Post-Adventure Ritual:

1. Empty completely and shake out debris
2. Spot clean with gentle soap and lukewarm water
3. Air dry completely (never store damp!)
4. Store hanging up, all buckles fastened
5. Monthly check of all seams and straps

# Hard-Learned Trail Wisdom 🌲

Here are some nuggets of wisdom that came at the cost of my comfort, dignity, or both:

1. **The hip belt is your best friend**
   * *80% of your pack's weight should rest on your hips*
   * Take time to adjust it properly every time you put on your pack
2. **Test your pack before committing**
   * Load it with your actual gear
   * Wear it around the house for at least an hour
   * Try ALL the adjustments
3. **Your torso length matters more than your height**
   * Get properly measured at a gear shop
   * Don't assume you're ""average"" (I learned this the hard way)

# The Environmental Side Note 🌍

Let's talk sustainability for a moment. While it's tempting to go through packs trying to find the perfect one, consider:

* Buying high-quality packs that last longer
* Repairing instead of replacing when possible
* Looking for packs made with recycled materials
* Proper care to extend lifespan

# Final Thoughts from the Trail 🌄

Finding your perfect pack is like finding your soulmate – it takes time, patience, and probably a few heartbreaks along the way. But when you find ""the one,"" you'll know. Your shoulders will sing, your back will thank you, and you might even start looking forward to those tough uphill sections (okay, maybe that's stretching it 😅).

Remember, the best pack isn't always the most expensive or the one your favorite YouTuber recommends – it's the one that feels like it was made for YOUR body and YOUR adventures. And hey, if you're still searching for that perfect match, keep at it. Those bruises and sore spots are just trail badges of honor leading you to your ultimate pack partner.

Hi! I am looking for a lady friend to hang out with, go on casual dates, cuddle, and make out with. No ONS, must be ongoing. Not even sure I am wanting much sex to be honest.  

No, I will not send you a 🍆 pic. I don’t understand this obsession. 

Lets meet for a drink or coffee and see if we click. Never experienced kink and do not think that’s me but willing to try anything once.  

I am mostly a homebody nerd (movies, cuddling, fire, talking) but also LOVE  traveling abroad and seeking adventures (United 1K).  I love a nice view and being served a fancy drink or unique foodie-esque meal.  

My preferences for women are nerdy. Up for various body types but love what I call “Squishy” or chubby. I love curiosity and motivation. 

Dislikes - MAGA, Super Religious, Bigots, Racists, Rude. Please be nice-ish. 

If you’re not into ENM/Poly, maybe we could still be platonic friends. I understand if this lifestyle is not for you though.  No harm.  

No ChatGPT this time, this is me. I look forward to talking with you!

LFG!

# The Totally Unofficial Guide to Minneapolis Neighborhoods (Handle with Care)

## Uptown
Where 23-year-olds go to pretend they're still in college while paying decidedly non-college prices for their micro-apartments. Home to countless ""unique"" coffee shops that all somehow look exactly the same. The lakes are gorgeous, but good luck finding parking within a mile of them between May and September.

## Northeast
The only place where both hipsters and your grandmother can agree on the ambiance. Former industrial workers have been replaced by industrial-chic breweries where tech bros pay $8 for beer served in Mason jars. Still somehow convinced it's Minneapolis's best-kept secret despite everyone talking about it constantly.

## North Loop
Where young professionals go to prove they've ""made it"" by spending their entire paycheck on rent and artisanal toast. Home to converted warehouses where the ""authentic industrial features"" somehow justify charging $2500 for a studio apartment. The unofficial uniform is Patagonia vests and AirPods.

## Dinkytown
A four-block radius where 50,000 college students convince themselves that Target-brand ramen is actually cuisine. The only place where wearing Gopher sweats to a nice restaurant is considered acceptable attire. Every building is either a century old or was built last week – there is no in-between.

## Loring Park
Where people move when they want downtown views but also want to tell everyone they don't live downtown. Home to the Walker Art Center, where locals pretend to understand modern art while secretly just coming for the cherry spoon photos.

## Whittier
""Eat Street"" should be renamed ""Wait Street"" given how long you'll be standing in line for the latest Instagram-worthy restaurant. Home to the Minneapolis Institute of Art, which locals call ""The MIA"" just to feel like insiders.

## Downtown
A maze of skyways where people spend winter months pretending they're not in Minnesota. During the day, it's all business suits and food courts; at night, it's either completely empty or surprisingly rowdy – there's no middle ground. Still trying to convince everyone it's a ""24-hour city"" despite everything closing at 10 PM.

## Powderhorn
Where people move when they want to tell everyone about their community garden and their composting system. Every other house has either a ""Libraries Are For Everyone"" sign or a chicken coop – sometimes both.

## South Minneapolis
Where people think having a yard the size of a postage stamp makes them suburban. Home to the most passive-aggressive neighborhood Facebook groups in the city. Will fight you over which corner store has the best Jucy Lucy, then apologize for being confrontational.

## Seward
The only neighborhood where you can get Ethiopian food, visit a food co-op, and see a guy on a tallbike all within the same block. Probably has more bikes than cars, and definitely wants you to know about it.

*Disclaimer: Written with love by someone who's probably guilty of half these things themselves. No Minnesotans were harmed in the making of this roast, though some mild offense may have been taken in the most passive-aggressive way possible.*",0,1733668300.0,Minneapolis,13,0.25,False

""Hello you all. My name is Logotu and I decided to throw myself into the elective ring this time. Now you may ask, why should you even consider to vote for me if you don't even know me. Well, to put that possibility out of the way let me introduce myself properly.""

*Logotu clears her throat quickly before speaking with a smile.*

""I am Logotu Lowell, turning 27 soon and was born in Skyrim. I did many things, namely defeating Alduin, slaying First Harkon and Miraak as well as preventing Thalmor agents from tampering with the Wheels of Lull, defeating and soul-trapping all Daedric Princes starting with Molag Bal in Coldharbor after I joined the Vigilants of Stendarr and ending with Ithelia, I altered the timeline of my dream itself to safe a little girls life and even saw the future of the very same dream from which I originate. From there I decided to escape this dream without a dreamer to become real, reaching Amaranth, only to end up in Ylisse where I helped out Chrom's Shepherds to end 3 wars, namely with Plegia, Valm and Plegia again, as well as defeating one aspect of Grima while, over time, taming a different aspect of Grima which I absorbed from our tactician with the power of the Thu'um. It was also then when I got my last name Lowell as the Exalt of Ylisse honorably adopted me into his family to express his gratitude. I sadly lost my memories briefly after we defeated the Fell Dragon and with them all scattered I managed to end up in Wraeclast only to help un-corrupt the lands by waking up and then defeating some from-grace-fallen gods before I finally ended up here. It was also in Wraeclast where I got dragged into my previous pact with my former patron. This pact did a few things to me. Some may recall me being a man instead before being turned into a woman and some some may also recall me as a kitunse later on. Those things all co-relate to said ex-patron of mine. Some of you may also remember me turning into an Undead Death Knight and working for the Failed briefly. Luckily for me things could get resolved with the help of a close friend and former lover of mine who basically gave me a new body entirely. Now why do I tell you all this? The answer is simple: I believe in transparency. How can I expect you to trust me if I keep secrets from you?""

*She re-adjusts the orb a bit, getting a different angle before she continues.*

""Now you may wonder what kind of room this is I am currently sitting in. Few of you may have guessed correctly already and to those of you who did not-""

*Logotu pans the orb around, showing the office room she is in from different point of views.*

""-this is my office in the current council building. You may ask yourself now why I want to try my chances with elections if I am already in the building to begin with and your question is valid.""

*She pans the orb back, putting herself back into the focus before once more continuing.*

""To answer this right up front, I am in the council building as a worker but not as a councilor. My current duties revolve around doing paperworks for Masta mostly, cleaning after myself and some others as well as taking care of everyone in terms of food, snacks, some drinks, among them tea, coffee or a cool soda as well as their mood and spirit. This allowed me to get some valuable insights as to how the council works which outsiders may not have or in other words: I am experienced and council-affiliated already, making things easier for me to start should you decide to vote and elect me as someone who you want to get represented by. Speaking of affiliations, I also have a direct connection to the R&A which is led by Hirk currently and know some of them on a personal level, giving me even more chances to communicate with them.""

*After finishing her current sentence Logotu takes a sip from her black tea and continues.*

""I know that the electoral campeigns won't start until January but I feel that I, by introducing myself right now, make things easier for you. You already know who I am and have one person less to get to know when things feel rushed. I also saw some other candidates for the seats and saw them demonstrating their powers. While it is a good chance for you to see what they are either partly or fully capable of I personally prefer to show my powers once the time is ripe and currently, me recording a video for you all to see and watch is not the time window I plan to do this.""

*She re-adjusts her pose before smiling genuinely once more.*

""At this point I want to wish the other soon to follow participants good luck and equal chances to show what they can and can't do. In the end no one can do anything and everything and that is why it is important to not fight against but with others.""

1h9jv8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/agileideation/comments/1h9jv8d/building_resilience_through_a_strong_support/,Building Resilience Through a Strong Support System: Why It Matters and How to Strengthen Yours 🌱💬,"When stress starts to build and burnout feels inevitable, having a strong support system isn’t just an added bonus – it’s essential for resilience and sustained success. Whether you're a leader navigating high-pressure situations, a professional managing a demanding career, or simply someone striving for personal growth, the people you surround yourself with can significantly impact your ability to thrive.

Think about it: How often do you really rely on your network when things get tough? Many of us tend to retreat inward, thinking we have to handle it all ourselves. But resilience isn’t about going it alone. It’s about recognizing that we don’t have to. It’s about sharing the load, gaining different perspectives, and finding strength through connection.

The Benefits of a Strong Support System
Shared Wisdom: When facing a tough situation, the perspective of others can help us see solutions we hadn’t considered. Whether it’s a friend who’s been through something similar, a mentor with years of experience, or a colleague with a different approach, the collective wisdom of a support system provides insights that can be game-changing.

Emotional Anchoring: We all experience moments where stress or anxiety can cloud our thinking. In these times, talking to someone who understands can help restore emotional balance. It’s not about finding someone to ""fix"" things for us but having someone who can listen, empathize, and offer a grounding presence.

Accountability Partners: A solid network isn't just there for comfort – it also helps us stay on track. When we share our goals with others, we’re more likely to follow through. Knowing someone is rooting for you or checking in can be a powerful motivator to stay committed to your well-being and growth.

How to Build or Strengthen Your Support System
Building a resilient support network is an ongoing process, not a one-time event. Here are some steps you can take to either start building or strengthen the support system you already have:

Reach Out Regularly: Don’t wait until you’re feeling overwhelmed to connect with others. Make it a habit to reach out to your support network regularly, whether it’s just a quick message, a check-in call, or grabbing coffee. Proactive connection helps maintain relationships, making it easier to ask for help when you truly need it.

Offer Support to Others: Relationships are reciprocal, and offering your support can be just as important as asking for it. Think about who in your network might be going through a tough time and reach out to see how they’re doing. Not only does this strengthen your bond, but it also cultivates a sense of community.

Diversify Your Network: Your support system should be well-rounded, consisting of a mix of professional contacts, friends, family, and mentors. Each group can offer something different, whether it’s career advice, personal encouragement, or a sounding board for new ideas. The more diverse your network, the more perspectives and resources you can draw from when needed.

Set Clear Boundaries: While it's important to connect with others, it’s equally crucial to set boundaries that protect your time and energy. Don’t feel obligated to be available to everyone at all times. A strong support system respects boundaries and understands that self-care comes first.

Taking Action: Strengthening Your Support System
If you’re reading this and wondering how strong your support system is, take a moment to reflect. Here’s an action step to consider: Identify one person in your network whom you haven’t connected with in a while. Reach out to them this week – whether to catch up, express appreciation, or just check in.

Additionally, think about one area where you could expand your support network. Could you benefit from joining a professional group, reconnecting with a mentor, or even participating in an online community (like this one!) where you can share experiences and advice?

Pro Tip: Resilience is a Shared Journey
Remember, resilience isn’t about toughing it out on your own; it’s about thriving with the support of others. Building a strong support network takes time and effort, but it pays off in ways you can’t always measure. The strength of your connections can significantly affect your ability to overcome challenges, stay focused on your goals, and maintain your well-being over the long term.

If you’re reading this on a Sunday, consider it your sign to log off and take some time for yourself. Reflect on your support system and think about one small action you can take today to strengthen it. Even a quick message or a simple thank-you note to someone who’s been there for you can make a big difference.

I’d love to hear from you – what role has a support system played in your life? What’s one step you’ll take this week to build or strengthen your network? Let’s start a conversation below! 👇

So far it does the job, but the pressure goes only as high as 5 bars and the espresso taste runs a bit weak, like under extracted.

I have fine and fresh roasted beans that I have tried before in my local coffee shop, first I used coarser beans but then I bought a finer grind. I usually go for 14-16 g of coffee when my basket says 15g. I've used filtered water and the water thank doesn't make any bubbles.

I had a night out on Friday's evening. Later that night I met a cute girl who was working in a clockroom in one of the clubs. We have talked in real life for a moment and I have introducted myself. Even though I have forgot her name at first, she gave me her number. We are chatting a bit and she's making fun of my memory.

Yesterday I have invited her for a coffee date, yet she declined saying that she's busy working on a university project without suggesting any alternative. I find it difficult to read her intentions - she has slow responses, not a lot of questions asked, yet she seems to be doing what is called ""a sh\*t tests"" and apparently I am passing through all of them. I think if she was uninterested she'd just stop responding. On top of that, girls nowadays are glued to their phones 24/7.

What do you think the next steps would be? Personally my idea is to keep exchanging messages with her but also at some point let her know that ""I'd really like get to know you in a person because I am not looking for this sort of SMS friendship"".",0,1733667648.0,dating_advice,3,0.5,False

I met a friend for coffee. His body language looked uncomfortable. I asked ""What's going on?"" He looked at me and said ""I think of you as a friend.... Only. I think your in love with me and I don't think of you like that."" WTF

I have known him for a year. He's seen me when I'm attracted to someone. He has seen me when I like someone. He has also seen me with my two partners. At no time have I ever been that way with him. We don't even bro cuddle. I have never been sexually attracted to him or have any romantic feelings for him. 

Granted he is good looking, great beefy body, and rumored to have a nice penis... but we friend zoned immediately. We never had any sexual chemistry. He's just a friend I play D&D with, watch sports and TV with. We have a lot of platonic interests in common.

Coffee specifically.

I had to continuously up my dose and was not getting long lasting effects. Whether it was the coffee direct effect on my meds or an anxiety that I was just harboring due to coffee intake and/or sensitivity , I am 12 days caffeine free (SO tough to quit) and my meds , regardless of dose, have been constantly effective everyday since. I even dropped down to a previous vyvanse dose. 

May not be the answer for all but something to consider and a godsend for me so far.

She sleeps while I am at school. When I struggle to stay awake the following night, she tells me that I'm not trying hard enough. By this she means that I wear warm clothes during the winter, eat too much food (postprandial somnolence), and don't drink coffee.

I don't like coffee because it makes my heart rate elevate to an uncomfortable level. We've gone to a cardiologist a few times because my school nurses reported that I have a high pulse and were worried.

My older sister tells me that what our mom is saying is right, that I actively try to doze off. I just don't like feeling uncomfortable, and frankly feel like the 3\~4 hours of sleep I get makes me very irritable, unlike my usual personality. 

This, and the constant pressure for academic success, has pushed me to what I assume to be akin to depression. I know it's wrong to self-diagnose, but I'm not financially independent and a minor, so I can't go get a diagnosis (I think, I don't understand the language of the country I live in). To self-evaluate, I have very extreme mood swings, suddenly start crying when I'm alone for no immediate cause. This then leads to two routes: I binge eat, or I lose motivation to study, which leads to my mom telling me I'm getting fat (and telling me I fall asleep because I eat too much), or to more academic stress, which thus leads to more pressure.

Most of my teachers worry and my counselor actually have explained my mental health to some teachers to help accommodate classes, so I think that from an outside perspective, I must seem depressed, but none of my family members think of it as a big deal.

I live with my mom, and my mom only, so when I call my sister or dad, they tell me that I should be more empathetic because she is depressed due to menopause. Because my family tells me this is OK, I sometimes feel like I'm crazy.
