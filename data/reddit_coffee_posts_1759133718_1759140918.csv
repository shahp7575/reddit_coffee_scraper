I came across Take A Shot Coffee but haven’t seen many firsthand reviews. Has anyone here worked with them before? Open to other local recs too. Just want someone reliable who knows how to handle a crowd.

1nte55k,https://www.reddit.com/r/singleph/comments/1nte55k/tiny_moves_by_bleachers/,Tiny Moves by Bleachers,"I’m a 33-year-old guy (M) who has survived enough plot twists to know that I’m not here for two coffee dates and a quick ghosting. I’m looking for a real connection, someone I can call my partner in crime for concerts, gigs, late-night walks, and maybe even a cycling date or two. Because honestly, life’s just better when you’ve got someone to pedal, sing, and laugh through the chaos with.

And if you’ve ever listened to *Tiny Moves* by the Bleachers, you’ll know exactly what I mean — it’s not always the big, dramatic gestures that matter, but those little moments that sneak up on you and make everything feel right. That’s what I’m looking for here. The kind of bond where we notice each other’s tiny moves, and they end up meaning the world.

About me:  
• Fun-sized at 5’7 (171cm)  
• Inked on both arms, each tattoo comes with a story, one I may or may not oversell.  
• Chubby, but currently in “plot twist” and “do not disturb” mode with weight loss  
• Cyclist who enjoys long rides just as much as late-night walks.  
• Plays the guitar. Bonus if you like serenades, because I firmly believe I can sing  
• Casual gamer who still yells at the screen when I lose to a bot in FIFA 😃  
• Works mid shift from 3 PM to 12 MN, which basically makes me a night owl disguised as an employee  
• Loves long walks at night. Romantic strolls or fast food quests, your call.

Every morning, I make myself a cup of tea or coffee. Before, I only really drank those drinks sometimes, but now it's everyday since I added them to my morning routine.

Anyway, a few days ago, my boyfriend told me he was worried I have a caffeine addiction because I mentioned I almost overdosed on caffeine by drinking a few energy drinks, so he took all the caffeinated drinks and put them on the highest shelf (I'm short so I can't reach).

I told him I'll quit for a week just to show him I'm not addicted. I didn't think it would be a big deal since I'm usually not even tired after waking up, but yesterday and the day before I had some nasty headaches, and I didn't know why at first, but then my boyfriend says that the fact I'm having caffeine withdrawals is proof that I have an addiction. I wanted to have just a bit, but he said no.

Luckily, sleep helps, and I feel better now that it's the morning.",1,1759140644.0,self,0,1.0,False

Here’s how I turned mine into a client-magnet and how you can do it too:



1. Banner = Your digital billboard

Say who you help, how you help, and why someone should care.

No fluff. No guessing. Just clarity that converts.



2. Profile Picture = Trust trigger

You don’t need a studio shoot.

Just a clean, confident photo that feels approachable.



3. Services Section = Your offer upfront

If your dream client lands here and doesn’t “get it” in 5 seconds, they’ll bounce.

Make it obvious.



4. Featured Section = Proof you’re legit

This is where you show your receipts.

→ Case studies

→ Client magnets

→ Results

→ Portfolio pieces



5. Posts + Newsletters = Visibility that sells

Strong visuals + clear message = top of mind AND top of feed.



This setup works.

It’s simple. Strategic. Scroll-stopping.



This got me thinking…

1nte1rl,https://www.reddit.com/r/DormEats/comments/1nte1rl/best_essay_writing_services_my_dramatic_review/,Best Essay Writing Services: My Dramatic Review Journey (Literally Needed All the Help),"You know that moment when the library windows start glowing with sunrise, and your brain feels like scrambled eggs? Deadlines are multiplying faster than you can cross them off, and for a second you seriously consider just crawling under the desk and giving up. Instead, you clutch your cold coffee and start hunting for any way out. That’s how I stumbled into the world of essay writing services. I tried them all - fueled by panic, caffeine, and pure desperation. And here’s the kind of review I wish I had before my very first all-nighter with a blank Word doc staring back at me.

**Why I needed the best online essay writing services:**

* Professors don’t care about your other five classes. RIP my planner
* Group projects are a myth, you end up doing it alone anyway
* My cat threw up on my research notes (not kidding)

I needed more than just the best custom essay writing services - I needed something to actually save my grade. So I went all-in, scoured forums, read the best essay writing services reviews, and tried the most raved about platforms myself.

What even counts as top rated essay writing services? So like…who even decides which sites are the best essay writing services? I looked for:

* Real people’s reviews (not just the ones on their website)
* 100% plagiarism-free and passes Turnitin
* Quick with deadlines - like, will you help if my paper is due in 6 hours??
* Actual citations, because the last thing I need is my professor roasting my sources

**HERE’S MY 100% DRAMATIC ESSAY WRITING SERVICES RANKING:**

|Service|Delivery Speed ⚡|Quality 📚|Plagiarism-Free ✅|Support 💬|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|SpeedyPaper|5/5|5/5|5/5|4.5/5|
|WritePaperForMe|4/5|4.5/5|5/5|5/5|
|EssayMarket|4.5/5|4/5|4.5/5|4/5|

The best research paper writing services actually do exist. Here’s my quick breakdown (maybe oversharing but that’s my brand):

**SpeedyPaper**

If you need help at 3am… just check it out here: [SpeedyPaper](https://essay.watch/kj5G5K?type=67). Literally saved me when I forgot about an 8-pager (omg). Fast, everything passed Turnitin, came with proper formatting and citations. Also, they cover all topics, so you’re not left hanging. Prices aren’t the cheapest but omg, sometimes you just want it done.

**WritePaperForMe**

This is the one I turn to for outlines and research help. They actually listened to my weird topic notes and gave back a solid draft with well-picked sources. Would I use them for a whole term paper? Probably, esp. if I’m stuck. Here’s the link if you want to panic less: [WritePaperForMe](https://essay.watch/nzQhPF?type=67).

**EssayMarket**

If you’re picky (me) and want to see writers’ bids before deciding, this is your spot. I liked that you can compare offers, but read the writer reviews carefully. Good for smaller essays or when you want to control the price more. Here’s where you pick: [EssayMarket](https://essay.watch/f8xFh8?type=67).

# WHAT I LIKED (AND DID NOT LIKE, SORRY):

**Pros:**

* Actual people to chat with (not just bots)
* Most platforms offer full originality check and formatting help
* Can get complete anonymity if, well, you’re paranoid like me
* Great for getting feedback or help with drafts before panicking fully

**Cons:**

* Speed = $$ (Faster means higher prices, cry)
* Read terms carefully (refunds are not always simple)
* Not every writer is a mind reader, so leave clear instructions

**Do these services pass for actual quality?**

I ran everything through Turnitin. Passed every time. No obvious plagiarism. Some drafts needed edits, but nothing wild. Professors didn’t suspect a thing and one even returned surprisingly solid feedback (bless).

**Before you order** (I made a checklist because, of course I did):

* Be super clear about your topic selection and deadline!
* Double-check citation style (APA, MLA, etc)
* Read recent reviews for that writer if you can
* Use the plagiarism checker they offer

# FINAL LIST OF THE BEST ESSAY WRITING SERVICES:

1. [SpeedyPaper](https://essay.watch/kj5G5K?type=67) – my default emergency pick
2. [WritePaperForMe](https://essay.watch/nzQhPF?type=67) – research and outlines MVP
3. [EssayMarket](https://essay.watch/f8xFh8?type=67) – best if you want options and to compare bids

Chapter 1 – The Letter That Started It

David never saw himself as the type of man who would write to a stranger. But on a wet October evening, loneliness pressed down on him with such weight that he felt like his apartment walls were leaning inward.

The rain hissed against the glass as he sat at his kitchen table. The yellow light above buzzed faintly, the shadows twitching every time it flickered. He placed a blank sheet of paper in front of him and began to write:

“Dear stranger,
I don’t know who you are. That’s the point. There’s something pure about speaking to someone without baggage or expectation. My name is David. I live in the city. I’m not looking for anything in particular—just… a conversation.
Yours,
David”

He invented a name—“Alex Grane”—and an address: 512 Harrow Street, Hillford, MA. He didn’t check if it was real.

Mailing it felt both absurd and thrilling. He half-hoped nothing would come of it.



Chapter 2 – The First Reply

Two weeks later, there it was—an envelope in his mailbox with Alex Grane in the return address. The handwriting was unsteady, the lines tilting in odd directions, like a marionette learning to write.

Inside:

“Dear David,
I got your letter. You’re right. There is magic in talking to a stranger.
I think I’ve been waiting for someone like you.
	•	Alex”

David stared at it for a long time.



Chapter 3 – Harmless Beginnings

Their first few exchanges were simple. David talked about books he liked, a café where the barista knew his order, a stray cat that hung around his street.

Alex’s replies were short, peculiar, but not overtly threatening:

“I used to read, but now I mostly watch the shadows move.”

“Do you ever think about how a person’s handwriting is like their voice? Yours is careful. Like you don’t want to upset anyone.”

The tone was odd, but David found himself intrigued. The letters felt more… personal than any conversation he’d had in years.



Chapter 4 – Small Hooks

By November, Alex’s letters had grown stranger.

“I try to guess what your kitchen smells like. Sometimes I think coffee, other times something sharper—like metal.”

“Do you ever leave your curtains open at night? You should. I’d like that.”

“I think about you when it’s quiet. Which is most of the time.”

David never shared his address or appearance. At least, he didn’t think he had.

Still, the letters kept arriving, the envelopes damp from rain, the paper inside cool to the touch.



Chapter 5 – The First Disturbance

In early December, David saw them. A figure across the street under a dead streetlamp. The silhouette was motionless, featureless under a hood.

He crossed the street toward them, but they slipped into an alley without a sound.

The next letter read:

“You looked cold last night. Thicker gloves would help.”

David’s pen hovered over the page before he decided not to reply at all.



Chapter 6 – When Silence Feeds the Fire

Two weeks without writing.

Then: an envelope containing a black-and-white photograph. Grainy. His kitchen window. Himself, inside, head bent over paper.

Two days later, another letter:

“I like watching you write.”



Chapter 7 – The Games Begin

In January, Alex’s tone shifted.

“Here’s something you can try: tonight, sit in the dark and listen for the sound of your own breathing. If it’s not yours, don’t move.”

“I left you something. You’ll find it if you stop looking so hard.”

That night, David found a coin on his kitchen floor. A foreign coin—something he’d never owned.

A week later:

“Do you talk in your sleep? I heard you last night. You were saying my name.”

David started sleeping with the lights on.



Chapter 8 – The Apartment Changes

In February, the little things began.

A chair moved half a foot from where it was yesterday. His keys on the table instead of the hook. The smell of his apartment—once faintly of coffee—now tinged with something unfamiliar.

The letters grew more intimate.

“You hum sometimes when you’re making tea. It’s nice. I hum too, so we match.”

“You keep locking the door. I don’t like that.”



Chapter 9 – The Breaking Point

By March, David was unraveling. He jumped at every creak in the building, every shadow outside the window. His letters became short, angry.

Finally, he wrote:

“Alex,
Whoever you are, stop. This is harassment. If you contact me again, I’ll go to the police. Don’t come here. Don’t write to me again.
	•	David”



Chapter 10 – The Realization 

That night, he came home to find his door unlocked. On the kitchen table: an envelope, unmailed. His own handwriting on the front.

Inside:

“David,
I am you.
I’ve always been you.
You’ve been writing to yourself for months. I’m the part you’ve been ignoring—the one who’s tired of being alone.
Tonight, we’ll meet properly.
Don’t lock the door.”

From his bedroom came the sound of slow, deliberate footsteps. The door began to open.



Chapter 11 – After

The next morning, the apartment was empty.

On the table:

“Dear stranger,
I don’t know who you are. That’s the point. There’s something pure about speaking to someone without baggage or expectation. My name is Alex.
I live in the city.
Yours,
Alex”

David was never seen again.

You inflate awards into coronations of your greatness, when they’re almost basically raffle draws with souvenirs.

You scold cousins for ethics you yourself leave in the gutter.

You pretend to be diet-conscious on cam, but the meals you hide crawl into the light through your peers’ cameras.

1ntdvc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/1ntdvc9/senior_colleague_took_over_a_phd_supervision_i/,Senior colleague took over a PhD supervision I initiated — how to handle this?,"I’m dealing with a tricky situation involving a more senior colleague, and I’d appreciate some outside perspective.

After one of my postgraduate courses, a student approached me to ask if I would be interested in supervising her PhD project. She’s an excellent student, and I was genuinely excited by the opportunity. We met to discuss ideas, and she went away to draft a proposal. I reviewed her draft in detail, providing extensive feedback, and then did the same again on her revised version. In total, I’ve spent a couple of hours providing feedback and have also met with her three times.

Initially, the student told me she planned to approach a more senior colleague to be a secondary supervisor. This colleague took quite a while to respond, but eventually agreed to meet the student for coffee. After that meeting, the student emailed me to say that this colleague had offered to supervise the project — but only as the *primary* supervisor — and wanted to know if I was okay with this change.

Not wanting to put the student in a difficult position, I said yes. Still, the whole situation has left me feeling uneasy. To add to this, the senior colleague has previously told me (rather gleefully) that she once warned this same student away from another potential supervisor.

I’m not sure how to interpret all this or how I should handle it going forward. Has anyone been in a similar situation? What would you do?",4,1759139646.0,academia,2,1.0,False

1ntdv7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1ntdv7o/breadcrumbing/,Breadcrumbing??,"Ugh. Seems like this is a common pattern these days in the dating world. Matched with a guy my age (48) and we hit it off, had 5 really good dates (5-6 hours each)over about 3-4 weeks. Then he warned me he had a big work project coming up and he would be focusing on that and not as available. He is starting a new business and it’s been a rough go for him. I don’t think he’s seeing other women. Pretty sure I’m an anxious attacher when I like someone but I am trying super hard to match energy. I told him I understood, I liked him enough for us to stay in touch but I wasn’t willing to put my life on hold for 2-3 months for him. And I haven’t. I’m quietly dating 2 other guys, mostly to soften the blow of what I think could just be breadcrumbing at this point. He does still text me every 2-3 days but no mention of seeing me again and I feel like our connection is fading out. Last text was yesterday just touching base the day after he had a minor surgery, which I appreciated him thinking of me during his recovery. I told him I needed consistency in order to stay connected and he couldn’t guarantee that so I’ve kind of backed off from him. So do I just sit back and let him initiate or do I shoot him a text every few days to try to stay connected? He said he’d like to try to pick things back up once he got the business up and going. I really liked him but don’t want to seem needy either! I feel like we all have the same 24 hours in a day and it’s not hard to at least plan something/even coffee, walk, drinks….or even a few minutes on the phone. I was in a very similar situation earlier this year and ultimately was told “I don’t have the bandwidth” to date right now and I’ve got those same vibes again.

I’ve been here a few days without cash while waiting for my paycheck to clear, so I haven’t had the chance to get out and enjoy much yet. Got paid today though — treated myself to a massage and I’m planning LT tonight.

That said, I’ve noticed I’m burning through money pretty quickly. On average:
	•	~350 baht/day on coffee
	•	~1,000 baht/day on food & drinks

The biggest killer is Starbucks. I love it, but at ~170 baht per drink, two a day ends up being 350 baht ($10 USD). Feels like I’m paying U.S. prices. Anyone know a solid coffee spot closer to 100 baht?

Food is another area I could improve. Alcohol is what it is — not planning to cut back there — but I’m sure there are great local restaurants with dishes under 300 baht. Any recommendations for where to eat on a budget?",0,1759139624.0,Pattaya,8,0.5,False
1ntduif,https://www.reddit.com/r/FilipinoTravel/comments/1ntduif/quick_paris_travel_tips/,Quick Paris Travel Tips,"I'm back with another travel report and sharing tips. I’m writing this now while waiting at CDG (Charles de Gaulle) airport for our return flight to Manila. We visited Paris for four days after our trip to Zurich.

# Visa

We (Me and my wife) applied for a Schengen Visa through the Swiss embassy because I am traveling to Zurich for a business trip and then going to Paris afterwards before flying back to Manila.  

These are the documents we submitted

1. Letter of Invitation (for me mostly as I am on a business trip)
2. Letter of Engagement (for me mostly again)
3. Print out of our Visa application form from online
4. Bank certificates for Visa purposes.
5. Income Tax Return
6. Print out of our marriage certificate
7. Itinerary
8. Paid Airline Tickets
9. Airbnb reservation confirmation
10. Paris hotel confirmation
11. Travel Insurance for Schengen Area

# Visa Fees

Short Stay Schengen Visa, max of 90 day - 90 EUR or 6,100 PHP per pax  
VFS Global Service Charges - 1,000 PHP per pax, optional 480 PHP for courier service

VFS Office in Circuit Makati for Swiss Visa (French Schengen Visa has a different office handled by TLS and their office is in Makati near Rockwell I believe.

# FAQs. 

Question: Can you make a dummy reservation before flying to Europe and submit that when you apply for a Visa?  
Answer: Sorry I can’t answer that as I’ve booked my flights before applying for a Visa. Actually the reason we flew to Zurich is because my Visa to London WAS DENIED and we already had tickets. I rebooked our flights to Zurich and Paris instead so here we are. Tell me in the comments if you've ever used a dummy flight booking to apply for a Schengen Visa.

Question: How much was your ticket to Zurich/Paris?

Answer: It was around 60K roundtrip for each pax.

Question: How much did you have in your bank account to get a Schengen Visa?

Answer: My wife had around mid five digits on her bank certificate and she got approved.

Question: What travel insurance did you pick?

Answer: The cheapest I found online was from Etiqa. (1,300 PHP each pax). I’ve bought travel insurance from them before and they tend to be the cheapest and most convenient to buy online. Make sure it’s for Schengen purposes.

Question: What hotel do you recommend?

Answer: If you have to pick a hotel prior to applying for a Visa then pick one that’s free to cancel in case your visa application is rejected. We stayed at City Residences Ivry Sur Seine which I could recommend because the price is not bad and it's 700 meters away from RER line C (yellow line). The room also had a complete kitchen though I can't figure out how to open the induction stovetop. Admittedly it's a skill issue.

# Money and How to Pay for Things in Paris

Don't bother exchanging currencies and just use your credit card. They use credit card terminals everywhere here and you'll need this to buy your Navigo card, your food, your tickets, pretty much everything. I didn't even bring a wallet with me just my phone and credit card stuck to the back of my phone case. I wore a phone sling and this was just so convenient and freed me from worrying about pickpockets because all I had to worry about was my phone which was tied to me. Maybe bring an ID case too to carry your Navigo pass.

# Transportation and How to Get Around in Paris

We flew to Zurich via Thai Airways which had a significant delay that caused us to miss our connecting flight to Zurich. I picked this airline because the price was OK but if you find a ticket to Europe that’s around the same price you might want to pick a different airline. I did not enjoy the food on board at all.

**Traveling to Paris by Train**

From Zurich we travelled to Gare de Lyon via TGV (around 45 EUR) which I bought the tickets online while we were still in Manila. In 2023 I bought a ticket on the same day from Zurich to Paris and I had to pay +100CHF for a ticket. I checked the price of a ticket on the same day of our departure and it was 115 CHF so I saved a lot of money by booking early. Do this only when your very sure with your itinerary.

**Traveling Around Paris**

I highly recommend the **Navigo Weekly Pass**. It costs 31.6 EUR plus an additional 5 EUR for the physical card since we didn’t have one before. It gives you unlimited travel in the five zones of Paris and you can use this on the RER trains, Metro trains and buses. It’s pretty much fool proof and as long as your trip is within the validity of(Monday to Sunday???) then go ahead and pick this. 

Let me explain why this is great value. If you’re arriving in CDG to France the cost of the ticket to Paris downtown is already 13.5 EUR plus the return of 13.5 so that already costs 27 EUR. In our busiest day of roaming around Paris we must’ve taken about 8 trips via train and bus so that costs 20.5 EUR already since a typical one-way ticket costs 2.5 EUR. It’s just great value and saves you from the headache of trying to figure out what ticket to buy for every trip.

The Navigo Weekly Pass can also be used to travel to Disneyland Paris and we used it to go to Provins which is 2 hours away from our hotel. I highly highly recommend the Navigo Weekly Pass.

**Lessons learned from traveling by train.**

We relied on Google Maps to know which train or bus to take to our destinations. We did make an error one time when we picked a train that skipped our station and the next station was like five stops away. We LEARNED about skip trains the hard way but you know that’s just the fun in traveling. The unlimited Navigo Weekly Pass saved us from an expensive mistake if we didn’t have it. 

So how do you know which train to take and AVOID the mistake we made? Google Maps will tell you which direction you need to look for. If you’re unsure, you could ask fellow passengers if you’re on the right platform. The phrase you need is

“Excusez moi, monsieur. Cette le quai a \_\_\_\_\_(direction you want to go)\_\_\_\_?”

Getting lost is part of the adventure.

# Connectivity

I usually use the GOMO roaming when I travel abroad but this time since I’m traveling with my wife I just connected to her phone’s hotspot. She picked a 10-day unlimited e-sim from Klook with coverage around Europe which she bought for almost 1000 PHP. We had RELIABLE connection from Zurich to Paris so I can recommend this. GOMO has a roaming package for 1 GB for 3 days that costs 10 GB if you were to convert your non-expiring data to it. I can’t review this as I didn’t use this on this trip. You really need this to access Google Maps for when you're moving around Paris. Price is OKish so go with this.

# Sites to See and their Prices

Louvre - We paid 22 EUR each for the tickets. You can buy online from their website or Klook but we bought direct from the website.

Gallery Lafayette - Rooftop with view of Paris skyline is free to access

Eiffel Tower - Free (23.1 EUR to go to the second floor or 36.1 EUR to go to the top. Adult prices)

Basilica Sacre Coeur - Free outside

Notre Dame - Free to enter but you need to book on their official website for a slot

# Food Budget When in Paris

They don’t have any 7-11 here but there are many SuperMarche around. If your hotel has a microwave you can buy microwaveable meals from these supermarche for around 6-8 EUR and that’s good for the two of us. A sandwich is around 6 to 7 EUR and that price is the same pretty much everywhere. A croissant is like 1.5 EUR. You can find cheap coffee for around 1.5 EUR as well but this is from a machine similar to what you see at local 711s. We saved a bunch by bringing food here including instant coffee. 

If you want to experience sit down dining. Expect to pay around 17-20 EUR per person and that doesn’t include drinks yet. Price is pretty much the same everywhere and they'll have prices on their menus so I didn't fear getting the ""tourist price"". It was all pretty transparent.

That’s pretty much all I have to share. Be kind to people you meet on the trains and offer to take pics of other tourists. The French are pretty cool people I don’t know where the bad stereotype comes from. Everyone says Bonjour around here.

I was seeing someone, but it went nowhere because he was obsessed with family approval and astrology charts, and couldn’t stand up to his parents. When I questioned how I’d ever have independence in such a setup, he accused me of being “disrespectful.” I tried explaining, but he wouldn’t listen, so I walked away.

Not long after, I met another guy for coffee. At first, he pretended to be a complete green flag — thoughtful, genuine, the kind of person you’d want to invest in. But in the end, he turned out flaky, and that really triggered me because it reminded me exactly of someone I met three years ago who had treated me the same way. Back then, I was much younger and it affected me deeply. This time, it just made me feel done. I’ve had it with these patterns.

Right now, I honestly need a break. This generation really doesn’t know how to maintain relationships. I’d rather stay single than keep repeating the same cycles.

First of all, considering the images, any overall improvements you suggest?

Would appreciate specific help/ideas on the following:

1 - need a proper desk since I do some home office and also like to game sometimes or do some random personal stuff on my computer so I would need to move that existing ""desk"" to another space. Possibly in the corridor where the heater currently is? What kind of desk would you also suggest?

2 - I cook a lot so it's natural for me to have a lot of kitchen utensils but I am already mentally prepared to downsize a bit (have stackable tefal pots with movable handlers which helps, but also have instant pot, air fryer, small coffee machine and Thermomix to consider). What I am struggling to imagine is where to put the usual pantry stuff since I don't have a proper pantry location. It's not immediate to understand in the images but I have a mini fridge next to the oven and on the living room side it's the freezer.

3- that TV is a 43 inch, would a 55 inch tv be too big for the space?

These are my major concerns, any help/advice would be welcome!

I think it could be my self concept and thinking that maybe I’m not really ready. Has anyone been in a similar boat to me?

# 

SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is the process of improving a website to increase its visibility when people search for products, services, or information on search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo. The better visibility your website has in search results, the more likely it is to attract attention and bring in visitors.

SEO isn’t a trick or a hack. It’s about building a better website, publishing better content, and making it easier for search engines—and users—to understand and trust what you offer.

# Why SEO Matters

Most people never scroll past the first page of Google results. That’s why ranking high matters. If your website isn’t on that first page, it’s almost invisible.

Every day, billions of searches are made. Some are for fun, but many are commercial—people looking to buy, sign up, or take action. SEO helps your content show up right when people are looking for it, without paying for ads.

Unlike paid traffic (which stops when you stop spending), SEO builds long-term, compounding value. It turns your website into a magnet for visitors.

# Three Main Pillars of SEO

SEO can be broken down into three main areas: on-page SEO, off-page SEO, and technical SEO.

# 1. On-Page SEO

This covers everything on your website—the stuff you control directly. It’s about making your content useful, clear, and easy to understand for both users and search engines.

# a. Keywords

These are the words and phrases people type into search engines. Good SEO means figuring out what your audience is searching for and using those keywords naturally in your content.

Example: If people search for “how to fix a leaking tap,” your page should mention that phrase in the title, headings, and content—without overdoing it.

# b. Content Quality

Search engines prioritize content that’s useful, original, and comprehensive. Your goal is to answer the user’s question better than anyone else.

High-quality content:

* Solves problems
* Is easy to read
* Has clear structure
* Includes helpful visuals or examples
* Is updated regularly

# c. Headlines and Structure

Search engines and readers both love structure. Using headers (H1, H2, H3, etc.) helps break up your content and makes it easier to scan.

Your main title should be an H1, and each major section should be under an H2. This also helps search engines understand what each section is about.

# d. Internal Linking

Linking between your own pages helps users explore related topics and helps search engines understand your site structure.

For example, a blog post about “SEO basics” might link to another post about “keyword research.”

# e. Images and Media

Every image should have a descriptive filename and “alt text” to help search engines understand what it shows. Optimizing image sizes also keeps your site fast.

# 2. Off-Page SEO

Off-page SEO focuses on how other websites interact with yours. It’s about reputation, trust, and authority.

# a. Backlinks

Backlinks are links from other sites to yours. When credible websites link to you, search engines see it as a vote of confidence.

The quality of the backlink matters more than quantity. A few links from respected sources are worth more than dozens from low-quality blogs.

# b. Brand Mentions and Authority

Even if a website doesn’t link to you, just mentioning your name can help build your authority.

Being cited, quoted, or talked about on other websites, forums, or social platforms boosts your reputation with both users and search engines.

# c. Social Signals

While not a direct ranking factor, content that gets shared a lot can generate backlinks, traffic, and engagement. That helps indirectly improve SEO.

# 3. Technical SEO

This is about making sure your website is built in a way that search engines can crawl, index, and understand.

# a. Crawlability

Search engines use “bots” to crawl your site. A clear site structure, sitemap, and robots.txt file help guide them. If search engines can’t access your content, it won’t rank.

# b. Site Speed

Page load speed is a ranking factor. A slow site leads to higher bounce rates and lower rankings. Use compression, optimized images, and a good hosting service.

# c. Mobile-Friendliness

More people search from mobile devices than desktops. Google uses mobile-first indexing, meaning it looks at your site’s mobile version first when deciding how to rank you.

# d. Secure Connection (HTTPS)

Google gives a ranking boost to sites that use HTTPS encryption. It protects user data and builds trust.

# e. Core Web Vitals

These are specific metrics Google uses to measure user experience, such as how fast your site loads, how quickly it becomes interactive, and whether things shift around as the page loads.

# Types of SEO

Beyond the three core areas, SEO can be specialized further depending on the goal or industry.

* Local SEO: Optimizing for searches in a specific area (e.g., “coffee shop near me”).
* E-commerce SEO: Tailoring product pages to rank for purchase-related searches.
* Enterprise SEO: Handling large, complex websites with thousands of pages.
* YouTube SEO: Optimizing video titles, tags, and descriptions to rank in search and YouTube itself.

# SEO Tools

There are many tools that help with different aspects of SEO:

* Google Search Console: Tracks how your site performs in search.
* Google Analytics: Measures traffic and user behavior.
* Ahrefs, SEMrush, Moz: Paid tools for keyword research, backlink tracking, and competitive analysis.
* Yoast SEO or Rank Math: WordPress plugins that help optimize content.

# Common SEO Myths

* “More keywords = better SEO” – No. Keyword stuffing hurts more than it helps.
* “SEO is a one-time fix” – SEO is ongoing. Search engines change, competitors evolve, and content gets outdated.
* “Just write great content and they will come” – You need strategy and promotion. Good content alone isn’t enough.

# The Future of SEO

Search engines are getting smarter. With AI-driven algorithms like Google’s RankBrain and BERT, they understand context, not just keywords. That means you need to:

* Write naturally
* Focus on user intent
* Optimize for real human experience, not just bots

Voice search, mobile search, and visual search are also growing, meaning SEO must adapt to how people actually search in real life.

# Final Thoughts

SEO isn’t magic. It’s strategy, consistency, and knowing your audience.

To succeed in SEO, you must:

1. Know what your audience searches for.
2. Create useful, high-quality content.
3. Make sure your site is technically solid.
4. Build trust and authority through backlinks and reputation.

Done right, SEO makes your website a reliable source of organic traffic, leads, and growth. It’s slow at first, but the rewards are real and lasting.",1,1759137984.0,u_Striking_Unit4202,0,1.0,False

1ntdes6,https://i.redd.it/6zdvihxsn2sf1.png,"I made this: Trespot, a city-based chat app for travelers (free)","Hey everyone! 👋 I’ve been building Trespot, a super simple way for travelers (especially solo travelers) to meet people in the same city, swap insider tips, and plan quick meetups without the awkwardness.

With Trespot you can:

* Join city chat rooms (Goa, New York, Bangkok, etc.) to find travel partners and last-minute plan ideas
* Verify trips by uploading a ticket (keeps chats real & spam-free) or join with limited messages if you’re just checking a city out
* Share and browse activities/photos from the people actually there (hidden gems, cheap eats, nightlife, rentals)
* DM privately from profiles to find your next trip BFF
* Get notified when your city access is approved & when someone messages you
* See upcoming trips in your profile so you can coordinate meetups ahead of time

Why I built it  
Most trip meetups feel scattered across random groups. I wanted one place where verified travelers can instantly talk to others in the same city and actually meet up for coffee, hikes, coworking, or exploring.

It’s free. I’d love feedback from real travelers what would make this genuinely useful on the road?",2,1759137795.0,TravelInIndia,0,1.0,False

People seem to print hundreds of these and wondering if it can be faster or if they just burn through coffee and wait :0

With Spenzy you can:  
• Track expenses in the way that works best for you (manually, typing with AI, or snapping receipts with AI)  
• Set budgets that actually help you avoid overspending  
• Split bills easily when you’re out with friends  
• Use multiple wallets and currencies (great for trips or business expenses)  
• Snap receipts and export them later for reimbursements  
• Privacy Mode masks sensitive numbers, so you can check your expenses and balances in public without worry.

There are plenty of spending trackers out there, but Spenzy focuses on being simple and convenient. It’s 100% free to use, and I’d love to hear your feedback

1ntdarj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1ntdarj/why_is_invigorated_water_pitcher_filter_a/,Why Is Invigorated Water Pitcher Filter a Must-Have? Comprehensive Review,"The Invigorated Water 43235-195943 pH ON-The-GO Pitcher Water Filter feels like a product crafted with thoughtful precision for anyone seeking cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable drinking water on the go. Carrying this small pouch around, I've had firsthand experience with how it performs in real-life scenarios, from office desks to hiking trails. While it has wowed me in several aspects, a few limitations deserve attention.

**Compact and User-Friendly Design**  
As someone who thrives on convenience, this portable water filter impressed me with its lightweight and resealable design. Sliding easily into a backpack or even a moderately-sized handbag, it quickly became my trusted companion. For its size (just 4.13 x 1.18 x 6.1 inches and a mere 4.64 ounces), the unit packs substantial filtering power. Using it is straightforward too; a simple soak before inserting it into your water bottle or jug makes it ready for action. The minimalist design combined with practical functionality hits the sweet spot for busy lifestyles.

**HUGE FILTER CAPACITY**  
With a filtration capability of up to 98 liters or 26 gallons, it feels like a resourceful solution. On average, it lasted me for almost two months, based on my regular consumption of 8 glasses a day. The longevity is beyond what I expected from such a compact filter. For those keen on drinking purified water without constantly replacing filters, this pouch offers extended utility.

[Check Invigorated Water 43235-195943 price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b076h1mxp5/)  

**Water Quality and Taste**  
After using the product consistently, the difference in water taste is evident—and I don't say this lightly. It effectively removes heavy metals, chlorine, and even some fluoride. These improvements are noticeable whether you’re drinking plain water or using it for tea and coffee. The elevated pH level (up to 9 as promised) brings a smoother texture and an unexpectedly refreshing quality. My coworkers who sampled the water during office lunch breaks were impressed by the lack of any metallic undertone or chemical smell.

**Good Aspects**  
- Filters out heavy metals and chlorine effectively.  
- Enhances alkalinity and improves taste.  
- Environmentally friendly and reduces dependence on single-use plastic bottles.  

**Eco-Conscious Solution**  
The sustainability factor of this product resonates deeply with me. Made from BPA-free, food-grade materials and designed to curtail plastic waste, this pouch aligns excellently with eco-friendly efforts. Bringing it to gym sessions and outdoor hikes, I ditched typical bottled water and felt good about minimizing my environmental footprint. It even earned me some ""wow, that's such a cool product"" remarks during a recent camping trip.

**Areas of Concern**  
Despite its advantages, a few drawbacks emerged:  
- The initial soaking process is a bit clunky and takes time to prepare.  
- Works best in mildly contaminated water; struggles with heavily polluted sources.  
- While the pouch is robust, it isn't immune to wear and tear if not handled carefully.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
Considering other portable water filters on the market, there are some worthy competitors. Compared to the LifeStraw Personal Water Filter, which is ultra-lightweight and better suited for survivalists, this filter pouch concentrates more on improving water's pH and taste—ideal for everyday hydration needs. Another rival, Brita's portable filters, offers solid filtration but falls short in alkalinizing water. The Invigorated Water filter carves a niche for those eyeing a blend of alkalinity boost and taste improvement.

**Smart Spending**  
In terms of value, the product holds its own remarkably well. Considering its long filter lifespan, the cost is balanced against how much purified water it provides. Unlike pricier electric filtration devices, this pouch achieves significant results without breaking the bank. It’s an excellent pick for budget-conscious individuals who prioritize health, convenience, and environmental sustainability.

I don't find fun the typical extroverted activities, they are just plain tiring. I'm also aware by experience that... I'm not missing out. I'm glad others enjoy but it's really a no for me. I'm not bored despite I do nothing that looks fun to others. I'm sure we are all quite similar in this in a way.

I'm driving from Newcastle to Edinburgh and for scheduling reasons I'll have between 1 and 2 hours more than I need for the drive. I also have a passenger who hates long road trips. Personally I think 2.5 hours is nothing and would just drive it, but I have the extra time anyway, so we'll be stopping. I was thinking about stopping at Berwick (which is about half way) and having a coffee and walk along the beach to break up the trip but it occurs to me that there might be something really cool that I'll be driving past.

Not the heavy horse museum near Etal because we've done that. But aside from that is there anything cultural and quiet along the A1 that I should do instead of walking along the beach? Are there any nice museums, cool things to do or historical gardens or something that aren't the usual touristy national trust type stuff? 

Edit after the first few responses: I actually live a little north of Newcastle so we are from southern Northumberland. I'm not new to the area generally and we spend time in Morpeth and Alnwick regularly.

Owing to the inherited & innovated skills of oxidation and roasting that enhances the features brought by terrains & cultivars, TW teas are highly versatile and can go with many ingredients effectively and harmoniously. But on the other hand, TW teas are not so much known by global tea communities, thus many widely adapted applications amongst TW/CN/JP still remain as strangers for the west. For value-added applications, TW teas can be divided into 4 categories:

 Floral Scenting – Layering blossoms such as jasmine, osmanthus, or rose enhances oolong’s natural aroma, creating premium scented teas for gifting and boutique markets.

 Fruit Peels & Dried Ingredients – Citrus peels, tropical fruits, and light spices transform oolong into flavored teas and sachets, appealing to both traditional and modern consumers.

Fresh Fruit Infusions / Juice Blending – Popular in hand-shaken tea shops and bars, oolong pairs with lemon, grapefruit, or guava to create refreshing iced drinks with high-volume potential.

Dark-Roasted Pairings – Coffee-like roasted oolong matches white chocolate, caramelized nuts, or dried fruits, extending into dessert pairings and high-end specialty blends.

I've been dealing with some frustrating issues with my espresso machine lately, and I thought I'd share my experience and solutions that might help others facing similar problems.

I remember the excitement when I first got my espresso machine, dreaming of those perfect morning shots. But sometimes things don't go as planned. After months of troubleshooting and research, I've figured out the most common reasons why espresso machines act up.

First off, let's talk about grind size. This was my biggest mistake when I started. If your coffee is too finely ground, it'll clog the machine. Too coarse? You'll get watery espresso. I learned that the perfect grind should feel like fine sand between your fingers.

Water temperature is crucial too. If you're getting bitter coffee, your water might be too hot. I found that the ideal temperature range is between 195-205°F. Most quality machines like the ones you can find here: https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine maintain this temperature automatically.

Another common issue is tamping pressure. You need about 30 pounds of pressure - not too light, not too heavy. I practiced by pressing on a bathroom scale until I got the feel for it.

Don't forget about maintenance! Clean your machine regularly. I'm talking about backflushing, descaling, and wiping down the group head. Hard water deposits can seriously mess up your brewing process.

Sometimes the problem might be with the machine itself. If you've tried everything and still having issues, it might be time for an upgrade. I recently checked out some great options at https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine and found machines that practically guarantee perfect shots every time.

Here's a quick checklist I use when my espresso isn't brewing properly:
- Check grind size
- Verify water temperature
- Ensure proper tamping
- Clean the machine
- Look for scaling
- Check water pressure
- Make sure beans are fresh

One thing I learned is that fresh beans make a huge difference. Those old beans sitting in your pantry for months? They won't give you that perfect crema you're looking for.

Also, don't overlook water quality. I switched to filtered water and noticed an immediate improvement in taste and fewer machine problems.

Remember, making great espresso is part science, part art. It took me a while to get it right, but once you nail these basics, you'll be pulling perfect shots consistently.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions - I'm always happy to help fellow coffee enthusiasts!",1,1759136876.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

Many people turn to vitamin supplements to fill nutritional gaps, boost energy, and support overall health. But did you know that *when* you take your vitamins can make a big difference in how well your body absorbs them? Understanding the timing and food pairings can help you get the maximum benefit.

Fat-Soluble Vitamins (A, D, E, K)
These vitamins need healthy fats for proper absorption. The best time to take them is with a main meal that includes foods like avocado, nuts, olive oil, or dairy products. For example, taking Vitamin D with breakfast that includes eggs or yogurt can enhance its effectiveness.

Water-Soluble Vitamins (C and B-Complex)
Unlike fat-soluble vitamins, these dissolve in water and are absorbed more easily on an empty stomach. Vitamin C and B-complex are best taken in the morning or early afternoon. Since B vitamins can boost energy, avoid taking them at night as they may interfere with sleep.

Iron and Calcium
Iron is absorbed best on an empty stomach, ideally in the morning, and works even better when paired with Vitamin C (like a glass of orange juice). However, avoid coffee, tea, or milk around the same time, as they block absorption. Calcium timing depends on the type: calcium carbonate should be taken with food, while calcium citrate can be taken anytime. If you need more than 500 mg per day, split the dose for better absorption.

Magnesium
This mineral is known for its calming properties, making it a great supplement to take in the evening. Many people find that magnesium before bedtime supports better relaxation and sleep.

Tips for Consistency

* Take your supplements at the same time every day to build a habit.
* Avoid taking all supplements together, as some can compete for absorption.
* If you’re on medications, check with your doctor or pharmacist to avoid interactions.

By timing your vitamins correctly, you’re not just taking supplements—you’re making sure your body truly benefits from them.

With Trespot you can:

* Join city chat rooms (Goa, New York, Bangkok, etc.) to find travel partners and last-minute plan ideas
* Verify trips by uploading a ticket (keeps chats real & spam-free)  or join with limited messages if you’re just checking a city out
* Share and browse activities/photos from the people actually there (hidden gems, cheap eats, nightlife, rentals)
* DM privately from profiles to find your next trip BFF
* Get notified when your city access is approved & when someone messages you
* See upcoming trips in your profile so you can coordinate meetups ahead of time

Why I built it  
Most trip meetups feel scattered across random groups. I wanted one place where verified travelers can instantly talk to others in the same city and actually meet up for coffee, hikes, coworking, or exploring.

It’s free. I’d love feedback from real travelers what would make this genuinely useful on the road?

Cubicles neatly lined up. Dust dancing beneath the singular light, flickering ever so slightly. Below the dust is a man. Alone. Frantically typing as if his life depends on it.

“They should really fix that,” the man muttered with a twinge of annoyance.

Dark circles formed below his eyelids. Tie. Loose. His once pristine white coat, now crinkled and stained
with coffee.

Spectacles resting upon his nose, behind those glasses is a man that has lost something.

His cubicle, his personal space, lays bare; no decorations, save for the file-infested desk.

His chair creaked, his nose twitched; he now realized the smell of the office space, dampness, and paper. But he has long since adjusted to his workplace, deep within the earth’s crust, containing God knows what.

The chair creaked again. The man had finally stood up after spending hours on his chair.

Feeling his joints and bones stiffened, he performs a daft parody of stretching. Bones popping echo in the silence ridden office space.

His eyes scour and survey his surroundings. Eyes that were hollow now sparked after setting his gaze on his empty coffee cup near his desk, surrounded by stacked files that contain nothing but redaction and classified information.

He moved with terrifying slowness. His muscles sluggishly developed.

After seven minutes had flown by, the smell of sweet charcoal filled the air. Now the man will return to his desk to rot yet again.

He walks slowly towards his dull cubicle, with a cup of near-boiling coffee in hand.

His steps became faster, more careless, and his grip tightened on the coffee cup, for he noticed that a new message had popped up on his computer screen.

To

Researcher Alfonso Hart

The clock is ticking, Alfonso.

You must hasten your efforts in what you are researching, surely it must not be that difficult considering it is a Safe-Class object.

I am urging you to increase your output two-fold in the coming days since your deadline is near.

From

Head Researcher Olivia Parkins

Alfonso’s face contorted to a grimace; a cold sensation ran down his spine, his fingers almost slipping on the coffee cup.

“That could’ve been bad,” Alfonso remarked, still feeling cold and dreary from the message.

Now realizing his situation at hand, he must retrieve an innumerable quantity of files.

The aroma of sweet charcoal is nothing but a fleeting memory; the usual smell of the office clawing its way back.

Alfonso scrambled to clean his desk space, foots steps muffling the inter-com announcements beyond the walls, soft thuds reverberating here and there.

After what felt like hours, he had finished stacking his files as high as the sky, or what felt like for Alfonso.

“Now that’s done, all that’s left is to get more files...” his voice descending from his throat.

Alfonso then turned towards the door, the way out.

Alfonso pulls his sleeve, a timeless and ornate gold watch shackled on his wrist.

A gift. A gift from his parents.

“Father,” whispered Alfonso, his eyes cold. He gazes at the extravagant watch as if he did not wish to know the time, only to look at it.

Alfonso begins to straighten his coat, almost mechanically; he continues to correct his tie, just like he was taught.

Hollow orbs staring at the void; unblinking.

He reached outwards to the handle.

Palms sweaty. A drop hit the floor.

“Ill-prepared again, Alfonso?” A voice cut through the back of the room, no, the back of his psyche.

His knees fail him, faltering; kneeling on the floor. His hands grip the handle still; never letting go.


Alfonso forced his legs and knees and his entire being to rise from the floor.

Breathless, he clutches his chest.

“Alfonso,” the voice hissed again, “Alfonso,” again the voice spoke; the words rang across his mind.

Alfonso closes his eyes, expecting it all to end.

The voices stopped.

Silence.

His heart. Serene.

His lungs. Stable.

Finally, he clutches the handle tightly and turns it downwards in one swift motion.

He walks towards the open door, eyes shut.

He happily inhales the air; the scent of soil and plants fills his lungs.

He opens his eyes, but the shining light obscures his sight.

His hands covering his face.

Bewildered Alfonso was from the unfamiliar smell, unfamiliar light, and the texture of the ground.

“W-where am I?” Alfonso stammered; asking someone, expecting an answer.

His vision gradually returned, then he finally had his answers.

A sea of golden-yellow wheat swayed erratically; surrounding Alfonso.

Everywhere he looked, his front, his back, his sides; upon the horizons were never-ending fields of wheat.

The sun shone brightly on his face, pridefully hovering over him.

The wind howled against Alfonso, his coat flowing, his tie slapping at him.

He stood alone on a small patch of grass, in the middle of it all.",1,1759136447.0,writers,1,1.0,False

I want the job, just thought it was super rushed with the scheduling, I assume the rush was to test how lazy I am because of stigma with people on benefits.

Most of life is just to show up and be there, it's the road to progress and opportunities and change. Being aware of my semi-functional state right now, I have two choices, either go through with this and end up in burnout in the near feature or miss it and let my depression intensify with shame, regret and hatred for myself.

None of the choices are easy on me and I fucking hate my life for it. I'm taking the first option and going full disassociative mode for I know no other way to handle this.

1ntd1cb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHome/comments/1ntd1cb/what_are_the_newest_types_of_ski_pants_available/,What are the newest types of ski pants available?,"Hey fellow ski enthusiasts! I've been skiing for over 15 years now, and I've seen how ski pants have evolved dramatically. After testing dozens of pairs this season, I wanted to share what's new and exciting in the world of snow pants.

The latest ski pants are nothing like what we used to wear back in the day. The technology has come so far that sometimes I feel like I'm wearing something from the future. I recently found some amazing options here: https://athometouch.com/ski-pants that really opened my eyes to what's available now.

Let's break down the newest innovations:

1. Smart Heating Systems
Some high-end pants now come with built-in heating elements powered by rechargeable batteries. They automatically adjust based on your body temperature - pretty wild, right?

2. Eco-Friendly Materials
The newest sustainable materials are incredible. They're using recycled plastics and even coffee grounds to create waterproof, breathable fabrics. Who knew your morning coffee could become your next pair of snow pants?

3. Hybrid Construction
The latest designs combine different materials in strategic zones. Think: stretchy panels where you need flexibility and reinforced areas where durability matters most.

4. Advanced Ventilation
The newest venting systems are game-changers. Some pants now have smart mesh that opens up when you're working hard and closes when you're sitting on the lift.

5. Enhanced Protection Features
The latest avalanche beacon pockets and RECCO reflectors are better integrated than ever. Safety features are becoming more sophisticated while remaining completely unobtrusive.

I've been particularly impressed with some of the options I found at https://athometouch.com/ski-pants - they've got everything from entry-level to pro-grade gear.

What I love most about the newest pants is how they combine performance with comfort. Gone are the days of choosing between staying warm and having mobility. Now you can have both!

A few tips when shopping for new ski pants:
- Look for fully-taped seams
- Check for reinforced cuffs
- Make sure they have enough pockets
- Consider if you want bibs or traditional pants
- Think about what insulation level you need

The waterproofing ratings have also improved significantly. Many new pants offer 20,000mm+ ratings while maintaining breathability.

Remember, while features are great, fit is still king. The best pants in the world won't help if they're not comfortable. Take time to try different styles and sizes.

Personally, I've found that investing in quality snow pants pays off in the long run. They last longer and perform better, especially during those long days on the slopes.

Let me know if you have any questions about specific features or brands - I'm always happy to help fellow skiers make informed decisions!",1,1759136280.0,AskHome,0,1.0,False

10. Then store them in an air tight container in nth refrigerator o even better in the freezer. Don't leave them on the counter, they will become soft quickly.

# Notes

\* You can easily make you own oat flour, using instant oats or rolled oat. use coffee grinder or food processor, whatever works best, and gives you a fine texture.  
\*\* I used regular dark chocolate chips, you can use any vegan ones. I have not used vegan chocolate chips, but they don't affect the texture of cookies, so I didn't experiment with them.  
\*\*\*I prefer you make your own peanut butter, even natural one may has added salt or oil, and it may affect the texture of cookies.  
\*\*\*\*I have not used any other plant milk. But cashew milk, and almond milk, should work too, but I have NOT tested it .",1,1759136018.0,glutenfreebaking,0,1.0,False
1ntcz17,https://www.reddit.com/r/SimulationTheory/comments/1ntcz17/what_if_we_are_the_users_and_they_are_the/,"What if we are the ""users"" and they are the ""sysadmins""?","Hello everyone. As a computer scientist, I wanted to offer my perspective on this matter. I used gen AI to make the outline more presentable.

I keep thinking about the idea that they are the sysadmins of our simulated reality, and we're just ""users."" The classic example of how they manage things is the Grandfather Paradox. People think it's a deep philosophical problem, but from an admin perspective, it's just a basic security issue. The past is essentially a ""read-only"" file. If someone builds a time machine and tries to, say, shoot their grandfather, the system's first security layer kicks in. Let's call it ""Causality Consistency."" The user would experience it as ridiculous bad luck: the gun jams, they slip on a banana peel, a random pot falls on their head. The admins call this ""local anomaly injection,"" always deploying the lowest-energy solution to protect the main timeline. It’s the universe telling you, ""Access Denied.""

But what if the user is really persistent? The system doesn't waste resources fighting them or rendering a whole new parallel universe, who has that kind of RAM? Instead, it does something smarter. When an action has a high enough ""Paradox Potential Score,"" it forks the user's consciousness from the main branch into a temporary, lightweight ""sandbox."" In this virtual machine, the user ""succeeds."" They kill their grandfather, they watch themselves fade from existence, thinking they've broken the system. But back in the main timeline, their grandfather just feels a little dizzy for a second and keeps walking. Once the paradox plays out and the user's consciousness is gone, the sandbox is simply deleted. And here's the twist: the system *lets* this happen because the user has just performed a free service. They've become a ""Causality Debugger."" Their entire attempt, the method they used, the logic they tried to break, is logged and analyzed like a penetration test.

To get really nerdy about *how* the ""Causality Debugging"" works, you have to stop thinking of a consciousness as just a person and see it as a process. The whole thing isn't a simple trick; it's an incredibly complex, self-improving security protocol for the simulation. Here's the step-by-step:

**Step 1: Paradox Potential Score (PPS) Detection** The moment a user's consciousness (`player_consciousness_ID: User_PID_248345`) even forms the intent to act in the past, the `causality.engine` runs an instant analysis. It scans the potential outcomes and calculates a PPS.

* Kicking a stone in the past: **PPS = 0.001** (Low Priority)
* Buying your grandmother a coffee on the day she met your grandfather: **PPS = 45.7** (Medium Priority)
* Erasing your grandfather from existence: **PPS = 999.9** (Critical Priority, Initiate Debug Mode)

  
**Step 2: Forking a Lightweight Virtual Instance** Once the PPS exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 900.0), the system runs a `fork()` command on the main timeline. It doesn't copy the entire universe, that would be insane. It just creates a lightweight virtual instance—a ""writable causality layer""—for the local area the user will interact with. Think of it like a programmer creating a new ""branch"" to test code without corrupting the main build. The instance uses the main server's data as ""read-only"" but writes any of the user's changes to its own temporary database.

**Step 3: Vector Analysis and Exploit Logging** When the user ""succeeds"" in killing their grandfather inside this sandbox, the system logs the action not as a crime, but as a ""penetration test."" A Paradox Resolution Engine kicks in and records:

* `exploit_vector`: The method used to break the causality chain (e.g., laser weapon, poison, faked car accident...).
* `contradiction_nodes`: The key data objects that now fall into logical conflict (e.g., `object_ID: Father` and `object_ID: User_PID_248345`).
* `system_response_latency`: How long it took the system to detect the conflict.

**Step 4: Patch Simulation and Signature Generation** Inside the sandbox, the engine starts simulating the lowest-energy ""patch"" scenarios to close the logical loophole the user just created.

* **Scenario A:** Create a history where the father was adopted, not the biological son. (`patch_signature: 0xAD09BEEF`)
* **Scenario B:** Create a history where the user was created in a lab, not born. (`patch_signature: 0xC104B07A`)
* **Scenario C:** Create a history where the grandfather didn't actually die, but had an identical twin who took his place. (`patch_signature: 0xDEADBEEF`) The engine analyzes these virtual patches and reports the signature of the most efficient one back to the main system.

**Step 5: Hardening the Main Branch** And here’s the masterstroke. The logs from the user's penetration test, along with the generated patch signatures, are uploaded to the main timeline's security protocols. It’s literally an antivirus update for reality. The `causality.engine` is now immune to that specific `exploit_vector`. The next time some other bright spark goes back in time to try and kill their grandfather with a laser gun, the system's ""random anomaly generator"" will have increased the probability of that specific weapon malfunctioning by let's say 5000%. The user's rebellion has just added another brick to the fortress wall.

The user's act of rebellion has made the system stronger, and the next person who tries the same thing will find it even harder. But the scariest part of all is that the system doesn't just wait for these attacks. It *induces* them. When the timeline becomes too stable or predictable, the system subtly ""inspires"" users—through sci-fi stories, dreams, sudden ""genius"" ideas—to start thinking about time travel. It needs creative minds to constantly test its defenses. So, that person's ultimate act of defiance, their grand attempt to shatter their reality, is not only futile but is actually a planned and encouraged maintenance routine. They aren't a rebel; they're just the highest-quality bug tester the system could ask for, working for free to reinforce the walls of their own prison.",1,1759136018.0,SimulationTheory,1,1.0,False

I look at her empty bed and still see her when I open the bathroom door, picturing the light shining on her face, her wondering why I am shining light on her because she is trying to sleep. I walk by her peeing spot, picturing me holding her while she pees so that she doesn't fall backwards while she crouches. My vegetable garden that she loved to wait by for me to give her a tomato. The constant internal reminder to go check on her to see if she needs anything and to hug her face if she's awake. I lost my baby girl, part of my soul. Just gone. She blessed my life, surrendered by her previous owner, already considered a senior dog at 11. She passed, 4 months shy of 15. It really felt like she would make it to at least 17 because she wasn't like other senior dogs to me. She is a strong old lady. Unable to walk anymore but still had pep in her non steps. Deaf, but could still hear you. I was going to be starting her on acupuncture for her arthritis, hopeful that it would help relieve some of her pain. I got her a wheelchair because she was losing her ability to walk, one she unfortunately never got to properly use. I became her legs for the last 9 months, each month needing more help to go outside. I've lost my reason to exercise, I really only did it to not hurt myself and to be able to carry her because nobody else could. I was happy to, it taught me patience and to cherish her knowing she might never walk again. I was ready to take her in a stroller on walks just to get her outside next week. But she is gone, hopefully to a place where she is able to run like she still did in her dreams every night. Looking back at all the pictures and videos I took of her, oh my how much she changed in these 4 years. I had forgotten how she looked like running around. The sounds she used to make before her laryngeal tie back surgery. How much she loved to tear boxes, sniff grocery bags, and lay her head on my lap. I want to hear her extra loud snoring again. I want her to kick me awake as she runs in her sleep while in bed next to me. I want her to eat my food off the coffee table while I go back into the kitchen to get water. I want to clean her nasty ear infection one more time. Pick at your dry skin patches. Please go step in your poop so that I can clean you up one more time. I miss you so much.. and it's only been one day since I had to say goodbye. I can't picture what it will be like in a week. A month? A year? We were together 24/7 for the last 4 years and now. She is no longer here. Just gone. My sweet baby girl. I knew this day was coming and tried to anticipate it, but it is true how they say nothing prepares you for it. A second bout of aspiration pneumonia was too much for her poor body. We had to let her go because she was no longer able to breathe on her own. I know that I'm not supposed to blame myself but I can't help but wonder what would have happened if I had taken her in the day prior when I was getting the feeling that there was something off. Would she still be here today? Even if she made it past a second time, would it progressively get worse and end up in the same scenario the next time? I will never know. It feels like a part of me is gone, and I don't know how I will be okay again. I have been crying all day at any hint of a thought of her. Saying her name brings me to tears. I drove to get coffee to distract myself, I pictured her in the back, on her bed, smelling away as I drove with the windows down and burst out in tears. I sat outside because everything inside the house reminded me of her, and I'm still unable to stop thinking about her. Everything about my day revolved around her. She was one and only. I hope that I was good enough for her. That she didn't see me frustrated, or inpatient. That I was a good person to her, and that she was happy with us. That she felt loved and cared for and that she didn't suffer. Whomever is caring for her now, please tell her that I love her and that she carved out a large place in my heart that will forever be hers. And please hug her extra tight for me.

So there's this guy. Let's call him MC. We met about 2 years ago, through a mutual friend. Then said mutual friend went through a phase of basically excluding me from the friend group, organising a lot of activities without me, so I didn't see him for like a year. Mutual friend left the country and I could find my way back into the friend group. MC was very welcoming, he seemed genuinely happy to see me again. 

Slowly but steadily, we started to hang out more often. At first with the other friends, but later also just the two of us. We'd meet up for coffee and then go for long walks through the city. We'd visit nice parks and have long conversations about all kinds of topics. Sometimes we'd spend the entire day together, sometimes even several days in a row.

This has mostly been happening over the summer. Meaning it's been going on for months now. The thing is, idrk what we are at this point. We never talked about that. Me personally, I wouldn't be opposed to dating him, just seeing where things go. But sometimes I drop small hints, like I try to make him laugh, or I show that I care about him, and he just completely ignores it. So maybe he doesn't see me in that way, which would also be fine. But then why does he constantly ask me to hang out with him? And get annoyed when I say no? Why not just leave me alone from time to time?

And that is just one part of the problem. An added layer of difficulty stems from my fear related to dating, and especially a fear of men who might be interested in me in a more than just friends kind of way. Sometimes he does something, or something unrelated happens that really triggers that anxiety in me. And then I get very nervous around him, sometimes I go silent, or I stop talking to him for like a few days afterwards. 

It's all related to my trauma, that incidentally happened about two years ago. Only, MC has no idea what happened to me two years ago. I don't think id be able to tell him either; it's all too difficult to talk about. He can tell that something's up, but I think he's just very confused as to what it is that stresses me out so much. And I just have a very hard time communicating what's going on.

So that's pretty much what's been happening. I'm currently in a ""he said something that probably wasn't meant in any sort of bad way but it scared the bejeepers outta me and now my fight or flight response is through the roof and idk how to handle myself but all I know is I don't wanna talk to him or anyone else for a while"" kind of phase.

Guess I'll just distract myself. Focus on work. I'm just gonna go on a solo quest, trying to finish this PhD.",1,1759135918.0,DiaryOfARedditor,0,1.0,False
1ntcy3h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ntcy3h,Long distance phone calls made from Jack Ruby's home telephone from October 1963,"Telephone records showed that, at 1:51 p.m. on November 22, Ruby made a brief call to Ralph Paul, who testified to us that Ruby had informed him that he was closing his night clubs for three days. Ruby, in fact, did that. At about 9:00 p.m. that evening, Ruby asked Paul to accompany him to Friday-night religious services, but Paul declined.
Shortly after 11:00 p.m. on Saturday, Ruby was at his Carousel Club. He made five short telephone calls, of one to three minutes each, between 11:18 and 11:48 p.m. Four were to Paul, and one was to an entertainer, Breck Wall, who was affiliated with the American Guild of Variety Artists (AGVA), a union that represented Ruby’s employees. Paul and Wall said that the calls related to a dispute Ruby was having with AGVA concerning favorable treatment of his competitors, who had not closed their clubs after Kennedy’s death. 

By 11:30 a.m. on November 22, 1963, Jack Ruby was at the advertising office of the Dallas Morning News placing ads for his two nightclubs, the Carousel Club and the Vegas Club. Newspaper employees recalled Ruby expressing concern about the financial condition of his businesses. They also recalled his complaining about a black-bordered advertisement attacking President Kennedy that the newspaper had run that day. It appeared to be signed by one Bernard Weissman as chairman of something called the American Fact-Finding Committee. As disrespectful as the ad seemed to Ruby, what troubled him more was that Weissman seemed to him a Jewish surname. He couldn’t believe that anyone Jewish would be associated with such an ad. 

At approximately 12:45 p.m., while still at the Morning News, Ruby heard that the president had been shot. One newspaper employee recalled that Ruby appeared obviously shaken and “sat for a while with a dazed expression in his eyes.” It is a matter of dispute as to whether Ruby then went directly to his Carousel Club or first to Parkland Hospital, where the president had been taken. 

Seth Kantor, an Associated Press reporter who knew Ruby, wrote on November 25, 1963 that Ruby had approached him at Parkland Hospital barely a minute before the president’s death was announced at 1:33 p.m. With tears in his eyes, according to Kantor, Ruby said, “This is horrible. I think I ought to close my places for three days because of this tragedy. What do you think?” Yet Ruby denied to the FBI and the Warren Commission that he had gone to Parkland Hospital that day. 

Ruby arrived at his Carousel Club no later than 1:45 p.m. By then, he knew that the president had died. He made numerous calls to friends and family. At 2:37 p.m. on November 22, Ruby telephoned childhood friend Alex Gruber in Los Angeles. He told his employees that the club would be closed for the next three nights. 

Over a course of about six hours, Ruby shopped for weekend food and made at least ten phone calls to relatives and friends in Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, and Irving, Texas. He also called his synagogue twice to determine if Friday services would be held. He prepared signs to announce the temporary closing of his clubs and made arrangements with the Dallas afternoon newspaper, the Times-Herald, to place ads about the closings. He was described as grief-stricken by all who came in contact with him. 

At about 5:00 a.m. on Saturday, November 23, Ruby phoned Crafard from his apartment, telling him to secure a small flash camera from the Carousel Club and wait for him and George Senator to pick him up. They drove to a billboard overlooking a Dallas freeway that proclaimed “Impeach Earl Warren.” Ruby wanted to photograph it. He thought the billboard was somehow connected to a full-page ad attacking President Kennedy that had appeared that day in the Dallas Morning News. Ruby suspected that the billboard, the ad, and the assassination were connected. Ruby was going to solve the crime.

After photographing the billboard, Ruby’s investigation proceeded to the main Dallas post office. There, he tried, unsuccessfully, to inquire who had the post office box with the number that was on the billboard. Thereafter, the trio stopped for coffee and a brief conversation about the billboard, the advertisement, and the assassination. By about 5:45 a.m., Crafard was back at the Carousel Club. Ruby and Senator were on their way home.

From about 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., Ruby was at his sister Eva Grant’s apartment for dinner. From there, he went to his own apartment and called his business partner, Ralph Paul, who said he wouldn’t go to temple with Jack. Arriving late at the services, Ruby spoke to Rabbi Silverman after his sermon in which he had lamented President Kennedy’s death. When interviewed by the FBI on November 27, 1963, the rabbi recalled that Ruby was not a regular at temple services and that he seemed in tears over the president’s death. 

At about 8:30 a.m., Crafard telephoned Ruby. Ruby had asked him to feed the six dogs that lived at the Club. Crafard was calling about the food. Ruby, forgetting that he had told Crafard he was not going to bed, responded with anger. Crafard told the FBI that Ruby’s anger caused him to make a decision. He fed the dogs, took five dollars that he believed Ruby owed him, left a note for Ruby, and set off hitchhiking to Michigan. This was strange behavior. The president had been assassinated. 

Ruby drove to the police station and ingratiated himself with out-of-state reporters. He told police that he was a translator for the Israeli press. At 11:30 p.m., prosecutor Henry Wade and Police Chief Jesse Curry held a press conference. Oswald was presented to the press. Ruby was there, pencil or pen and a small notebook in hand.
When Wade described Oswald as belonging to the “Free-Cuba Committee,” Ruby joined a few reporters in shouting to Wade that the committee’s proper name was the Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC). It was not surprising that Ruby knew of the FPCC. From the time that Oswald was arrested, the airwaves had been filled with background on him, and the committee’s correct name was being bandied about by reporters at the police station. 

When the press conference ended, Ruby approached the prosecutor, saying, “Hi Henry.... Don’t you know me? ... I am Jack Ruby. I run the Vegas Club.” Ruby then began distributing cards to the Carousel Club—one to Justice of the Peace David Johnston and another to Ike Pappas, a reporter for New York radio station WNEW. When Pappas had difficulty getting Wade’s attention, Ruby directed Wade to Pappas. Thereafter, Ruby brought Wade to a telephone line he’d opened to radio station KLIF, and directed KLIF reporter Russ Knight to Wade.

Ruby had succeeded in building his relationships with the press and police and telling them about his night clubs. From the police station, he went to KLIF, arriving at about 1:45 a.m., with his sandwiches and soft drinks. During the 2:00 a.m. newscast, Russ Knight credited Jack Ruby with arranging the interview with Henry Wade. 
By then, Ruby’s grief was not as pronounced, but his interest in being a sleuth had grown. He suggested to Knight that the assassination had been the consequence of Dallas radicals—meaning the right-wingers who hated Kennedy. From KLIF, Ruby’s next stop was the Dallas Times-Herald. He needed to look over the ads he had ordered for closing his clubs. At the Times-Herald, employees remembered Ruby as “pretty shaken up” but excited that he had attended Oswald’s press conference and had been able to arrange interviews for reporters. He also mentioned the Weissman ad, saying that it was an effort to discredit the Jews. The possibility that Jews would be blamed for the murder of President Kennedy had become an obsession with Ruby. It was not an unfounded obsession. This was 1963. Anti-Semitism was pervasive in America.

From the Times-Herald, Ruby drove to his apartment. He had not slept at all that night. Arriving at about 4:30 a.m., he wakened his housemate, George Senator, who later testified to the Warren Commission that Ruby began discussing the Weissman ad. Ruby, he said, recalled seeing a billboard on a Dallas roadway urging the impeachment of Earl Warren, and wondered if the same people had sponsored both the billboard and the Weissman ad.

Ruby recalled to the Commission that, sometime between noon and 1:30 p.m. on Saturday, November 23, he drove to inspect the wreaths at Dealey Plaza, then returned home, went back downtown, and called KLIF announcer Ken Dowe. A police officer at Dealey Plaza remembered Ruby as having been choked-up, almost in tears. At about 3:00 p.m., Ruby arrived at Sol’s Turf Bar. There, he talked with Frank Bellochio, a jeweler. Bellochio remembered an impassioned Ruby pointing  to a copy of the Weissman ad and showing him the photo he had taken that morning of the Impeach Earl Warren billboard. Linking the billboard and the ad to anti–Semitism in Dallas, Ruby said he regarded the photos as a news scoop. Without saying goodbye, Ruby left Bellochio abruptly. He then called his attorney, Stanley Kaufman, at about 4:00 p.m. The Weissman ad was very much on Ruby’s mind. By this time, Ruby had checked the Dallas phone directory, but had not found Weissman’s name. Kaufman recalled, “Jack was particularly impressed with the black border as being a tipoff of some sort—that this man knew the president was going to be assassinated.” Ruby told Kaufman that he had taken a photo of the Impeach Earl Warren billboard and had gone to the post office to be helpful to the police. At Kaufman’s suggestion, Ruby checked a Dallas street directory, but couldn’t find Weissman’s name.
When Ruby arrived at Eva Grant’s apartment an hour or two after leaving the Turf Bar, he continued to be obsessed with the Weissman ad. He told Eva that he had not been able to find Weissman’s name in the city directory. Both Eva and Jack believed that the inability to find Weissman’s name confirmed that the ad, the billboard, and the assassination were connected and were an effort to implicate the Jews. Ruby then called Russ Knight at KLIF and asked who Earl Warren was.

At about 8:30 p.m. on Saturday evening, Ruby called his friend, former Dallas police officer Tom O’Grady, who had once worked for Ruby as a bouncer. Ruby mentioned that he had closed his night clubs, criticized his competitors for remaining open, and mentioned the Impeach Earl Warren billboard.
By 9:30 p.m., Ruby was back at his own apartment. He received a phone call from one of his dancers, Karen Carlin, professionally known as Little Lynn. She had come to the Carousel Club expecting to be paid. Because she expected the club to be open, Ruby became angry, but he agreed to give her money.

In an apparently depressed mood, he called his sister Eva, who suggested that he call a friend. Ruby then telephoned Lawrence Meyers, the visiting friend from Chicago, with whom he’d had dinner two nights earlier. Meyers recalled to the Warren Commission that Ruby became highly critical of his competitors, Abe and Barney Weinstein, for not closing their clubs, and said, “I’ve got to do something about this.” Ruby and Meyers agreed to have dinner together the next evening.

Ruby returned to his sister’s apartment. At 10:44 p.m., he called his business partner, Ralph Paul, who later remembered both Ruby and Eva Grant being in tears as they discussed the assassination. After that call, Ruby went to the Carousel Club, where, over the course of the next hour, he made the several brief calls to Paul and Breck Wall. 

Sunday Morning, November 24. Ruby got up sometime between 8:30 and 9:00 a.m. The cleaning lady at his apartment called him at about that time. She found him “terrible strange.” He seemed not to comprehend who she was, although it was her custom to clean on Sundays. George Senator confirmed Ruby’s disorientation that morning.

At 10:19 a.m., Little Lynn telephoned. She still needed money. She asked for twenty-five dollars because her rent was due and she needed to buy groceries. Ruby said he was going downtown, anyway. He would send her a money order from Western Union. A few minutes before 11 a.m., he left, taking his beloved dachshund, Sheba, along with a portable radio, a revolver, and $3,000 in cash. It was during that drive, Ruby told the Commission, that he first thought about killing Oswald, if he could. His priority for the moment was sending a money order to Little Lynn.

The Western Union office was on Main Street, one block from the police station where Oswald was being held. The normal driving time to Western Union was about fifteen minutes. Ruby parked his car in a lot across from money-transfer office. He left his billfold and car keys in the trunk, and locked the trunk. He left Sheba in the unlocked car, and placed the trunk key in the glove compartment. He took with him $2,000 in cash, leaving $1,000 in the car, and then walked across the street to Western Union. 

Once there, he waited for another patron to complete a transaction. At 11:17 a.m., he finished sending a money order to Little Lynn. From there, he walked to the basement garage of the Dallas police station. At 11:21 a.m. C.S.T., surrounded by police officers, news reporters, and TV cameras, and in full view of a television audience of millions, Jack Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald. 
Dallas police detective Thomas McMillon, who was standing nearby, would remember Ruby saying, “You rat son of a bitch! You shot the president.” A few minutes later, while guarding Ruby on the police department’s fifth floor, Detective Barnard Clardy would hear Ruby say, “If I had planned to kill Oswald, my timing could not have been more perfect,” and “Somebody had to do it. You all couldn’t do it.” Ruby later denied making any such statements. Secret Service Agent Sorrels did not report them. The words recalled by McMillon and Clardy may not have been accurate. The tone and meaning probably were. 

Jack Ruby’s fifty-year-old, unmarried housemate, George Senator, described Ruby on Sunday morning as “mumbling, which I didn’t understand.... Then, after he got dressed, he was pacing the floor from the living room to the bedroom, from the bathroom to the living room, and his lips were going. What he was jabbering, I don’t know.” When Ruby left the apartment a few minutes before 11:00 a.m., Senator did not go with him. 
Instead, Senator called his friend, William Downey, and offered to visit and make breakfast for Downey and his wife. Downey declined. Senator then went to the Eatwell Restaurant in downtown Dallas for coffee. A waitress following the news suddenly shouted that Jack Ruby had shot Oswald. “My God,” Senator gasped. He gulped down his coffee, ran to a telephone, and quickly departed. He went directly to the home of his lawyer, James Martin. From Martin’s home, the two men drove to the Dallas police department, where Senator gave a statement.

If Ruby should shoot Oswald, his beloved dog Sheba could be rescued. At the same time, Ruby’s car could not be moved without a tow truck. If he succeeded, the $2,000 in his pocket might be enough for bond and release from jail. If he needed more, he could direct his lawyer to the additional cash in his trunk. Most important, he would be a hero. But he might not gain access to Oswald. Killing Oswald at the police station was problematic. No one, except the law enforcement officers who were interviewing Oswald, knew when Oswald would be moved. As the prosecutor observed, Ruby’s first obligation would have been to Sheba. His next obligation was clearly to send a money order to Little Lynn. Shooting Oswald seemed to come third. ",1,1759135909.0,JFKassasination,0,1.0,False

Type of feedback desired : General impression, immersion believability…

&nbsp;

“Do you need to talk to someone?”
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

People find coffee shops way more relaxing than their own couch. Some even find   them more productive than a busy office. There was something cozy about them   especially when it’s raining outside. Almost therapeutic. The shuffle of people, the   hissing from the espresso machine, the rain drops tapping on the windows. Zack liked   that - it made him feel not entirely alone. Today he sat in the far corner alone, his   table cluttered with his laptop, notebook, charger, backpack and an empty cup of   coffee, dry for God knows how long. The room was less busy than usual. Only a couple   of other tables had customers and everyone had their noses buried deep in their phone   screens. People don’t pay too much attention to others around them nowadays.
&nbsp;

“Excuse me? Can I sit here? Other tables feel too central and exposed…” a woman’s voice went muffled through his earbuds and he didn’t actually care much. He pointed to   the empty chair across of him and shrugged in agreement. He continued tapping on his   keyboard and handwriting something in his notebook occasionally.
&nbsp;

“Are you busy for real or you are pretending to be so no one bothers you” her voice   cut again through his concentration. He nodded slightly annoyed and pointed to his   earbuds.
&nbsp;

“Right…” said the same voice in reluctant agreement. “I won’t be bothering you then”.   Zack felt bad for being rude. But he didn’t feel in a mood to socialize with random   strangers today. He lifted his cup to take a sip and realized it was empty for a   while.
&nbsp;

“I guess you are just busy enough to forget about your coffee and stare at the monitor   with that serious face.” she joined again. Zack realized that he won’t be left alone   and decided to join in the so far one-sided conversation, finish it quickly and be on   with his work.
&nbsp;

“I guess, something like that, too!” He responded, removed his earbuds and placed them on the table. He looked at the woman who was interrupting his thoughts for a while. She was young, her autumn colored hair tied in a messy pony tail, wore round glasses and had freckles.
&nbsp;

“Honestly speaking we all do it from time to time” she winked and smiled.
&nbsp;

The waitress came and picked his empty cup.
&nbsp;

“I apologize sir,  but our customers are asked to order something every hour if they use a table for work. House policy! She pointed to nervously the sign above the cash register, stating exactly that. Zack sighed and looked at his new companion across him and back at the waitress.
&nbsp;

“Two strawberry milkshakes then, that would be it for now!”
&nbsp;

The waitress glanced oddly at him nodded and left.
&nbsp;

“Oh, sweet, that is my all-time favorite!” She became lively “How did you know?”
&nbsp;

“Lucky guess. Who doesn’t like a strawberry milkshake…” she granted him with a warm smile and thankful nod.
&nbsp;

“Do you spend a lot of time here?”
&nbsp;

“I used to…”
&nbsp;

“With a friend?” She kept firing questions at him, without waiting for him to finish answering the last one.
&nbsp;

“A girlfriend.” He paused, eyes fixed on the empty table in the corner, She tilted her head waiting. “We met there, few years ago.”
&nbsp;

“That’s sweet… do you still see her?” The girl asked. The waitress came before Zack answered. She placed the strawberry shake glasses on his side of the table, and left. He shrugged and pushed one of them in front of the girl making an annoyed face.
&nbsp;

“No…” he took a breath and looked down. “She passed away last year.”
&nbsp;

“Oh…” The girl changed her happy face to a concerned one. “I am sorry, I didn’t mean to bring that up…”
&nbsp;

“It’s ok. It took me awhile to be able to talk about it, but I believe I am ready to move on.”
&nbsp;

“If it is not too intrusive, but what happened?”
&nbsp;

“We weren’t together for a long time but I was convinced she was the one I will spend my life with.” His eyes shined. “I had a ring prepared in my pocket. Her brother was driving her back to town.” he let a nervous cough “Their car skidded on\\ the road and went off a cliff. They didn’t survive!”
&nbsp;

“I am so sorry! That is terrible!” She nodded in sympathy.
&nbsp;

The waitress came again but this time as if she hesitated a bit, but approached the table anyway. Zack was surprised that another hour had passed without him realizing. She leaned slightly towards him and said.
&nbsp;

“I am so sorry,  sir… I don’t mean to be rude, but…” she swallowed nervously “… Are you feeling ok? Should we call someone for you?”
&nbsp;

“What? Why wouldn’t I be?” Zack was visibly irritated.
&nbsp;

“Sir… you’ve been talking to yourself for two hours!”
&nbsp;

He was shocked. He turned but her chair was empty and tucked neatly under the table.   The strawberry milkshake glass was still full and untouched. He crumpled and pressed   his hand to his face. His shoulders shook as the tears flowed down his face. The   waitress didn’t know what to do, she wasn’t prepared, leaned in and placed her hand on   his shoulder.
&nbsp;

“Sir?” She whispered gently “Do you need to talk to someone?”

Okay weird weird weird.

I had a lot of fun w my hook up Flash. It was rly weird.

We were kissing and having sex a bunch. We smoked a joint, then went for a midnight coffee run. I stayed the night. I ended up smoking too many cigarettes. I'm not even a smoker, idk why I've been struggling to control myself around cigarettes. I get so itchy, I honestly don't know why this bothers me.

He's probably autistic, the way he was snuggling with me was very stim-y.

He's a massive dick, so so inappropriate overall. He had this master plan that we should pretend to be in love. I was already feeling a bit feeling-y before I met Flash, but after this ""roleplay"", it was pretty fucking confusing lol.

I mean, it's a good plan, fake it till you make it. Ykwim?

It's actually a weirder story, how we met. That's a story for a different day.

The sex was okayyy, but it was really fun to hang out and snuggle.

We should be going for another date soon, so I'm looking forward to it. I might have him over to hang out with my friends this evening.

It was crazy really. The kinds of insanity there is in the world is quite intriguing.

I'll keep you updated Diary.

A weight, familiar and unsettling, pressed down on the small of my back. My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat in the silence of my own apartment. I hadn’t heard a thing. Not a lock picking, not a footstep. Nothing.

A warm breath ghosted over my ear, followed by the faint, intoxicating scent of jasmine and vanilla. *Her* scent.

“You were dreaming of me again, weren’t you, Alex?” Her voice was a low, silken purr, devoid of any question. It was a statement of fact. “I could feel it. Your pulse… it quickens for me even in your sleep.”

*Chloe.*

My muscles tensed, a primal urge to fight or flee surging through me, but it was immediately smothered by a deeper, more confusing current of raw desire. It was always like this with her. A terrifying, exhilarating paradox.

Her lips found the sensitive spot just below my ear, and a violent shiver racked my body. “Shhh, it’s okay,” she murmured, her voice dripping with a possessiveness that should have sent me running. Instead, my traitorous body reacted, a low groan escaping my lips as her hips ground down against me. The thin fabric of my boxers did nothing to hide my growing hardness, and she laughed softly, a rich, throaty sound that vibrated through my very bones.

“See? Your body is so much more honest than you are. It knows who it belongs to.”

Her hands, strong and surprisingly deft, gripped my wrists and pinned them to the floor above my head with one of hers. The effortless display of strength sent another jolt through me. With her free hand, she traced the line of my spine, her nails scraping lightly, teasingly, over the skin of my lower back. I was trapped. Completely at her mercy. And the most horrifying part was the molten heat pooling in my stomach, the way my breath hitched with every touch.

She shifted her weight, and I felt the cool air on my skin as she tugged my boxers down my thighs in one swift, practiced motion. I was exposed to her, to the cool night air, to my own pounding heartbeat. A cocktail of humiliation and white-hot anticipation burned through my veins.

“I watch you, you know,” she whispered, her mouth once again at my ear as her hand slid between my legs from behind, cupping me. I jerked at the contact, a strangled sound catching in my throat. “I watch you get coffee. I watch you laugh with your… *friends*.” The word was laced with venom. Her fingers began to.move, a slow, torturous rhythm that had me pushing back against her hand despite myself. “I know your schedule better than you do. I know your routines. Your life is an open book to me, Alex. *My* book.”

Her words should have been a warning. They were a confession of madness. But all my brain could process was the expert pressure of her palm, the way her fingers tightened just so, the promise of release coiling tight within me. *God, she knows exactly how to touch me.*

“Why do you make me do this?” she breathed, her voice taking on a harder edge. “Why do you make me remind you?” Her hand stilled, and the sudden absence of sensation was its own form of torture. I whined, a pathetic sound I barely recognized as my own.

I felt her move again, and then the cold, smooth touch of silk glided over my skin. A tie? A scarf? She looped it around my wrists, pulling it taut, securing my hands together. The bondage was not rough, but it was absolute. *I can’t move. I really can’t move.*

She rolled me onto my back, finally letting me see her. Her eyes, dark and bottomless pools of obsession, gleamed in the sliver of moonlight filtering through the blinds. A faint, triumphant smile played on her perfect lips. She was still fully dressed in a black, form-fitting dress, a stark contrast to my naked vulnerability.

She didn’t say another word. She simply mounted me, settling her weight onto my hips, her own thin panties the only barrier left between us. She leaned forward, her hair creating a curtain around our faces, her breasts pressing against my chest. Her breath was hot on my mouth.

“You’re mine,” she stated, her voice dropping to a guttural, dominant whisper that left no room for argument. It was a primal claim. “Every sigh. Every moan. Every drop of pleasure you will ever feel… it’s because *I* allow it. *I* provide it.”

She rocked against me, the friction exquisite and maddening through the silky fabric. My hips bucked involuntarily, seeking more, earning me a sharp dig of her nails into my shoulders. The sting was a bright, clarifying pain that only heightened the pleasure.

“Ah, ah,” she chided, her smile widening. “You don’t get to set the pace. I do.” She gripped the sides of my face, forcing me to look directly into her intense, consuming gaze. “You will look at me. You will watch who is ruining you for anyone else.”

With her other hand, she yanked her panties to the side, and I felt the wet, searing heat of her core press against the head of my cock. A gasp tore from both our lips. She was so ready, so impossibly hot. She held herself there for a agonizing moment, letting me feel the promise of her, letting me drown in the anticipation.

Then, with a slow, deliberate, crushing pressure, she sank down onto me, taking me inside her inch by devastating inch. My world narrowed to the sensation of being enveloped by her tight, gripping warmth. My head fell back, a guttural moan ripped from the depths of my soul as she bottomed out, her hips flush against mine.

She didn’t move. She just stayed there, impaled on me, her inner muscles fluttering around my length, her eyes holding mine captive. The intensity was unbearable. The fullness was everything.

“Say it,” she commanded, her voice husky with her own pleasure, her own breath coming in short, sharp gasps. Her nails traced my jawline. “Say you’re mine.”

I was beyond resistance. The pleasure was a tidal wave, and she was the only anchor I had. My voice was a broken, ragged thing. “I’m… I’m yours.”

A true, radiant smile broke across her face then, one of pure, unadulterated triumph. “Again.”

She began to move, rising up until I was almost free of her clutching heat before slamming back down, setting a brutal, perfect rhythm that stole the air from my lungs.

“I’m yours!” I cried out, the words torn from me with each powerful thrust. “God, Chloe, I’m yours!”

“Yes,” she hissed, her own control starting to fray, her movements becoming more frantic, more possessive. “Mine.”",1,1759135388.0,u_Real_Button_2421,0,1.0,False

I'm seriously sooo confused why Rosé keeps pushing this sad indie girl music. It's CLEARLY NOT WORKING. None of her Taylor Swift wannabe songs made any noise. APT which is an upbeat song went viral (partially due to Bruno but it's a fun upbeat song compared to the rest of her album). 

Even from Blackpink's discography, their popular songs were ALWAYS the upbeat ones. The ""sad"" songs like Stay were not popular. The good dance-y beats were what stood out about Blackpink and and their ""emotional"" type songs never make any noise. Rosé's solo songs in YG were so boring and no one cared, even Jisoo went viral with her song Flower because it had a catchy beat. 

If the ""sad"" type songs is more authentic to her, then that's great and all, but it's clear she wants to make it big - you would think she would learn from the success of her one upbeat song on the album. I believe she is the only one that could have a real chance of somewhat making it because she's the only one who can sing live, but she keeps self-sabotaging herself with these sad boring songs. 

She chose ""number one girl"" to be a single which is the most boring song ever instead of ""drinks or coffee"" which has a bit more life to it. Even at the Global Citizen Festival, she chose to sing another boring sad song ""two years"" AND SHE EVEN MADE APT AN ACOUSTIC VERSION?!  

Omg what is she doing?!?! I actually think she could have a chance of being somewhat successful in the west if she leans into pop-punk route so I don't understand why she isn't learning from the success of APT and going in that direction. 🤦🏾‍♀️",13,1759135248.0,BLACKPINKSNARK,8,0.94,False

I regret going.,"This is a first part of a story I came up with, and all written today so it may seem very rushed. Ill put a quick summary at the end. Also the formatting is kinda not at all good so sorry.

I sat on the edge of a leather couch, the ocean surface swaying the yacht gently. I clasped my hands and leaned forward.
“So, when do I get to know what I’m inspecting?” I asked to the well-dressed man that sat across from me. His name was Michael. He wore a three-piece suit and wore a fedora. A gold studded cane rested across his lap. He was very overdressed and it annoyed me immensely. 
“You’ll figure it out.” he replied bluntly. “But it will be worth your time, I can promise that.” He gave me a sleazy smirk. I leaned back and glanced over my shoulder, out the window. “We expect that it won’t take too long, couple days max. The engineers we’ve hired have done an immaculate job and it shooould be able to hold them in.”
I looked back at him and furrowed my brow. “Them?” I once again leaned forward, waiting for him to elaborate. Irritatingly he did not. Instead he just looked at me blankly for a few moments for slapping his thighs and standing, holding his cane to his side.
“Well, I’m going to get some fresh air. Feel free to help yourself to anything on the boat. While you’re a guest of Genesis, you’re able to do anything.” He gave me a wink, motioning at the heavily stocked bar and then exited out onto the deck. I stood and smoothed out my creased jeans. I walked over to the bar and looked through the glass cabinets, picking out a fancy wine. I looked over at the wine glasses before popping the cork from the bottle and taking a swig. I wiped my lips and set the bottle down on a polished marble counter. The ship tilted, sending the bottle over the edge of the counter and smashing on the wooden floor. 
“Ah, fuck.” I muttered. I looked around for some paper towels before deciding to just let some poor deckhand to clean it up. They’d find it eventually. I followed Michael out onto the deck and looked out at the sea. We were off the coast of West Africa, sailing to an island called São Tomé. I wasn’t exactly sure why I was invited to inspect a research station by Genesis, a company renowned for its widely successful treatments against previously incurable diseases, but I figured they must have been having some trouble with engineering. Probably something to do with me being an engineer.
I heard someone walking towards me and turned to face them. It was a burly man with a security vest on. He had a large, visually modified cattle prod on his left hip and a pistol on his right. He passed me and started to converse with Michael, who stood at the bow. I walked up a flight of stairs to my room and turned in until we reached land. 

I woke to the sound of knocking. I swung the door open just as the timid deckhand went to knock again. We looked at each other awkwardly for a moment before he spoke.
""Hey mister Angioti. We're about to pull into the dock, so mister White asked me to fetch you."" He turned to lead me off the boat.
""Hold on, just let me grab my things."" I said. He looked back at me.
""No need. Someone will come get them for you shortly, mister Angioti."" He walked towards the gangway and I followed closely behind. My feet hit concrete as I stepped onto the pier. I looked around the large dock and noticed tens of Genesis signs. Michael stood before me beside a man wearing slacks with a plaid checkered shirt. He was a big man and had an arrogant look plastered on his face. He stepped forward and offered his hand.
""I take it you're the reviewer? Name's Steve Hardy. I overlook the engineering here."" He had an Australian accent, which surprised me. I shook his hand.
""Bill Angioti.""
""Good to meet you Bill. Y'know what's going on here?"" 
""Yeah, you guys want me to take a look at something right? Inspect something?""
""Well, yeah, but,"" he paused and narrowed his eyes slightly, biting his lip. He leaned in to Michael and whispered something to him. Michael shook his head slightly. Steve clapped his hands together.
""Well, let's get going. Michael's going back to the mainland so you might not see him again. Don't worry, you're in good hands."" As he said it, Michaels jaw clenched ever so slightly as he looked past me, out at the sea. He waved over two armed men.
""Goddamned spy's back out at sea. Get some guys on it, now,"" he told them. ""And use X9 stimulant, not the X1, otherwise he'll never wake up."" The men nodded and jogged to the other side of the dock, where a large patrol boat was waiting. There was a large machine mounted on the front that looked like a huge spear gun. They called over to some other people that were playing cards around the boat, who picked up firearms and ran onto the ship. Curiously, although they each had a unique gun, they all had a cattle prod on their hip.
Michael cleared his throat. ""Well, I guess I won't be leaving just yet. Somethings just come up. I will be heading up to the lodge, so I still likely won't see you until later, but if you need me just give me a call. You should have unlimited data, so don't think twice about contacting me. I trust you have my details?""
""Yeah, they were on the contract you had me sign."" I replied.
Michael clasped his hands together. ""Amazing. I will see you fine gentlemen later."" He turned and walked to the other side of the dock, where a black limousine waited for him. The windows were tinted, but I could still make out the metal bars that were on the inside. They looked almost like prison windows.
While I was watching him leave, a dark green jeep pulled up next to us. The window rolled down and I saw a black man with aviators wearing a tan Genesis cap looking at Steve. 
""Sorry im late. One of the damn birds tried getting off with my gun, so I had to get one of the guys to taze it."" He said. He sounded tense. ""There's a problem with the walls on E3, so we'll need to get there now."" He looked at me. ""You'll be getting out there now, sorry. I'll tell someone to take your bags to the hotel."" 
Steve got in the passenger seat and I followed suit, getting in the back of the jeep. I learned that the driver's name was David, and he was a veteran who served in Iraq. 
""So what is E3?"" I asked him, looking for a way to pry something about what I was doing here.
""Its an enclosure. We have twelve of them, and usually theyre all in perfect nick. Lucky you came today, because this is the first time in three years we've had any problems. We've sedated everything in it, so don't worry about that."" 
I paused.
""What's in it?""
Steve chipped in. ""Just a few flightless birds. Genesis is taking a swing at some, uh, de-extinction of animals that humans have caused. You know what a Moa is?"" I shook my head. ""Well, its a big old thing that was native to New Zealand. Kind of like an emu or an ostrich. That's one of the things in E3. They aren't very dangerous, but we just don't want them escaping so we sedated them.""
""Well, what's the problem with the fence?""
David bit his lip while Steve continued to speak. ""Big old tree smashed down on the fence last night during a windstorm. Figured that you should come down and give us advice on how to reinforce the fences and stop it happening again.""
I sat back in my seat and watched the jungle pass as rain began to fall against the windows.

After about twenty minutes of driving, it came into view. The fence loomed ahead, metal bars glinting in the rain, humming faintly with electricity. Something about it didn’t make sense for just a few flightless birds. I saw a sign hanging from one of the bars that read

DANGER 12500 VOLTS

""Hey, what're the big fences for?"" I asked.
""Keep poachers out."" Steve replied.
It wasnt a satisfying answer, but I could tell I wasnt going to get anything else out of him. I guess Genesis had money to just throw at this place. 

Another ten minutes passed and the hole in the fence came into view. Dozens of people in overalls worked on removing broken struts and and replacing them with fresh ones. There were two large cranes that were set up, which were obviously needed to move the huge tree off of the fence. It was an old Santiria Balsamifera, probably a couple hundred years old. As we pulled up next to the workers, I noticed something. About ten of the men weren't workers at all, but more security guards. They all seemed uneasy, keeping their hands on their guns at all times. The workers all seemed even more anxious. They never turned their back to the enclosure, never moved passed the fence and their eyes darted around the foliage. 
""What's everyone so scared of?"" I asked.
""Well, y'know, jungle legends 'n' shit. The workers are native to the island and they've convinced half the staff here of their little myths. Real annoying for trying to get anything done, but these guys work like animals."" He said with a slight laugh. ""Judging by the damage id say we'll be here about four or five hours, so you'll get a bit of a look at how things work here.""
I stepped out of the jeep into the light rain and walked over to the fence. It looked like it could keep about anything in. I noticed an absence of any vehicles, aside from the trucks that carried the cranes. 
""Hey, where are all the cars at?"" I called back to Steve.
""What cars?"" 
""The cars these guys use to get here from base or whatever.""
Steve laughed ""They walk to and from the main facility""
I raised an eyebrow ""Really? Why?'
""Gotta keep costs down somehow"" he said, tapping his temple.
They had to keep costs down by not providing transport to their workers when they could afford huge, electric fences to protect birds? I shook my head. Damn corporate Suits.

David wasn't lying when he said it would take a few hours. It was just about night when we got back into the jeep, and even then there were still people working on it. David was pretty reckless with his driving to the main station. Before we'd been driving about fifty kilometers an hour, now we were hitting almost eighty. He wove around trees like he was a rally driver, and his eyes kept flicking to the rear view mirror. The rain had slowly turned into a downpour over the past hour, and the dirt path was turning to mud. Suddenly a shape flew past in front of us and David slammed on the break. Steves hand went to his hip, resting on his prod. 
""Shit."" David mumbled under his breath. He leaned into the jeeps radio. ""One out by..."" he looked at Steve.
""E10"" said Steve, who was opening the glove box and retrieving a flashlight, then winding down the window, illuminating the outside.
""One out by E10. Check the map, the log, anything. Gonna need a team down here in the morning. Conditions are too harsh tonight.""
He put the jeep back into gear and sped up the path again. Something about the interaction left me unnerved. I wouldn't admit it to the guys, but while we'd been working id had a talk to some of the workers. They told me stories of terrible animals that would stalk you through the jungle and then, when you looked away, rip you apart. Maybe, just maybe, I was starting to believe them. Just then, there was a low rumbling cry in the distance. I felt it resonate in my chest, and it drive a chill down my spine. I noticed David's hands tighten slightly on the wheel, and his foot pressed even harder on the accelerator. Steve wound up his window.

When we finally got to the facility, I was stunned to find a heavy gate in front of it. The fence it was attached to was even heavier than the ones securing the enclosures. We pulled up next to a control room, and David rolled down his window to show the gate operator who it was. The gate slowly swung open and the window was rolled back up. We drove into a large indoor parking zone. Hundreds of cars were parked in here, along with tens of trucks parked by a loading bay. Michael was standing on his own by a grand entrance into the building, and we left the jeep and walked to meet him. He held his arms wide, still holding his cane. 
""So glad you finally made it. How did the job go?""
Steve grunted. ""Still going, but its fine.""
""Good, good.""
""I'll leave Bill with you. I'm sure he's tired."" Steve said, already walking into the building with David behind him. Michael smiled at me and beckoned me after him as he too walked inside. As soon as I walked through the door, hundreds of people surrounded me. People carrying papers and folders, surrounded by even more armed men. seriously, why were there so many people with firearms here? I followed Michael into a humongous chamber, with a large digital map in the surface of an oval table in the center of it all.
""Welcome to the conference room."" He said with a grand flourish of his arms.
There were only a couple people here, most had signed out for the night, and Michael said hello to them. 
""This is a map of the whole facility, including all of the enclosures."" Michael told me. In each enclosure there were a number of red dots. They were all static and had tags that made no sense to me, usually a letter and then a number. I guessed it was the name and tag of animals but had no way to be sure. 
Michael hit a buzzer on the table and a teenager came in.
""Dylan, get me a coffee and a donut please."" He turned to me. ""You want anything, Bill? Its all free here, and it can be custom too.""
""Uh, sure, a banana milkshake sounds good.""
Michael turned and waved away the teenager.
I looked back at the map and noticed that there was a small cluster of blue dots on the edge of Enclosure Three, and that is when I noticed the only red dots that were moving. I looked up at Michael, who was busy talking in a hushed tone with the other people in the room.
""Hey, Mike-'
""Michael."" He said. ""Please call me Michael. What can I do you for?"" He smiled.
I bristled at his interruption. ""Why are these three dots moving?""
He came over and studied the map. The dots moved towards the hole in the fence. He furrowed his brow and bit his lip. 
""Just stay here a moment."" He walked quickly back to the others and turned away from me, saying something to them. I didnt catch it all.
""Yeah...issue...no, no...it'll be fine...guns ready...alright."" he turned back to me and smiled again as one of the people he had talked to produced a cell phone from her pocket and spoke into it.
""Those dots are assets. Must have woken up and are trying to see what all the fuss is about. Dont want them escaping so I've told the guys to sedate them again.""
He led me out of the conference room and led me up a flight of stairs to a deserted hallway.
""Here are the guest rooms. You'll be in the one at the end, so make yourself comfortable. I sent some people to retrieve your things earlier, so they are all in there already. Have a good night, Bill."" He said with a friendly smile, although there was something behind it that I couldn't quite place.

The night passes in the blink of an eye, and I am called down to the lobby. Michael meets me once more, this time with a man dressed in all black wearing shades. I thought he looked a bit stupid wearing them inside, but who was I to judge.
""This is Elias. He's one of the heads of security here. We'll be showing you through some of our protocols and systems today, so just follow us."" They took me through an abundance of rooms, the building seeming to stretch on and on, before we entered the security headquarters. Just in this room alone there was easily two hundred people. They were all relaxed, sitting at desks behind monitors that showed assorted cameras and layouts. Plastered on the wall was a large screen, split up into three parts. One third was a conglomerate of about fifteen different people, another was full of cameras that showed a boat at sea, and another that showed radar frequencies. I stared at the screen while Elias and Michael were talking to some of the security team. I frowned. The radar showed two green dots. One, at the center, was obviously the boat, which was the same one I had seen in the port yesterday. But there was another dot on it too. I looked back and forth, but none of the cameras were showing anything else. Then I noticed a smaller screen, one that had only a few words on it, perched above a picture.

UNDERGOING RECONTAINMENT
ASSET 105 - SPINO

The picture was of a large animal, with a weird shape to it. It had a long tail and an even longer snout. But most peculiarly, its spine was elongated and almost looked like a hand-fan perched on its back.
Dear God, I thought to myself as I looked back at the screen. I had been wrong wrong. It wasn't a spy out at sea.
The cameras showed a spiny sail breach the surface, causing a wave of water to splash onto the boats deck. I could hear shouting through the speakers as the crew of the ship all started moving at once. The security headquarters went deadly quiet as people processed what was happening. I saw handguns being drawn and strange syringes being loaded into launchers. Suddenly the room was alive once more, people shouting to each other and running to and fro. Michael grabbed me and began to push me out while Elias ran to a control panel. As he did i continued to watch the cameras. One man ran to the mounted harpoon gun and began to aim it at the beast, but as he did it smashed its huge body against the boat, sending it rocking. The man lost his foothold on the slippery deck and tumbled off over the guardrail and into the water, and then the door closed and I could see no more.

I went here on holiday to explore the region, chill and maybe find a place to live (I’m currently living in Warsaw).  
I’ll preface it with the fact that I was quite lucky with the weather as there was almost no rain after I left bilbao, but even there it was not that bad.  

Bilbao - oh wow. Wow. This whole city and actually greater bilbao itself is really really nice. Super comfortable public transportation system, great food, insane views and in general just a clean, good looking city. SF area was a bit suss with some dudes on a lookout, random public fights and stuff like that, but other districts were really nice and chill. Sadly, rent here is too high for my current salary haha. 1200+bills is a bit too much.  
Gijon - I wasn’t expecting much but I got everything and more than I ever wanted. City is clean, beautiful, with a great beach, walkable distance to everything, a lot of ciders and vermouth all over the place and even one of the best coffee spots I’ve ever been to (whatever coffee). I guess only worrisome part is small diversity in restoraunt types (mostly Asturian food) and proximity of a huge factory :/.  
I’ve met some cool locals there also, really nice memories. While rent is still high, it is much more affordable and this city is probably what I will choose if I finally decide to move.  
Oviedo - short ride on bus or train for a price of a 2 coffees and you get a whole new city. TBH I didn’t like it that much. City was kinda grim outside of an old town centre and overall offered nothing that gijon didn’t offer or worse. I had a great time drinking in some bar/shop in old town tho, that was nice. Also expo-centre is a really cool building.
A Coruña - hooooly, I hate this place lol. Sorry galicians. I dunno why, but this is first Spanish city that I’ve visited that didn’t feel Spanish at all. This place is grim, ugly, tired and just straight up depressing at times. I enjoyed two science museums and Zara 50years thingy on a monte de San Pedro, but other than that - demn, I wish coruna for me was just a destination instead of a real place.  
Overall, northern Spain - huge yes. Two thumbs up and all that. Now I just need to find a Spanish language teacher lol",3,1759134934.0,GoingToSpain,2,0.67,False

1ntcp7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ntcp7r/the_harsh_reality_of_sips_not_what_you_think/,The Harsh Reality of SIPs – Not What You Think,"There are a lot of things that happen in the world but are never really known to us, thanks to worldwide politics.

Like a study showing drinking coffee can lead to urinary bladder cancer—but it never proceeded further to confirm how much that’s true. Or cockroaches being ground into coffee, and that has been approved from America to the Australian government—because the coffee industry is big and corporates don’t want to lose. Even after the advent of 5G and with most people having access to the internet, such things stay hidden.

I understand the people who don’t have access to the internet also aren’t sipping their Starbucks. This is how the world works.



So likewise, there’s an “easy money printing scheme,” and if it’s easy, almost certain, then surely the big boys wouldn’t want us to know—the SIP, systematic investment plan.

Unlike mutual funds or maintained funds where the manager gets a cut, most SIPs, if self-done, only pay minimal fees (via expense ratio and other small charges).

But that wasn’t always the case. In 2015 or even 2018, SIPs weren’t hyped. It was almost with COVID—suddenly, everyone talked about SIP. Almost every tech YouTuber to news YouTuber pushed SIPs. Every post, every video—more of the same, especially in the immediate post-COVID era.

Wait a minute. SIP is a form of trading—mostly buying index. And trading means one has to lose for someone else to win—a zero-sum game.

And wait another minute—how come corporates, governments, and the big bulls didn’t react to every common man knowing the “secret sauce” to become a millionaire soon, or at least to ensure their kids would be millionaires?

Like my kids, your kids, everyone’s kids on this sub—millionaires.



Now, two questions:

1. Why didn’t corporates stop us from knowing, like the coffee example?

2. If all of us win, who will lose? Governments, hedge funds, or Musk/Gates/Ambanis giving us their share until they become poor?

If I invest 100 per month to get a million, who’s paying?



So—here’s the analysis and the fck reality.

As per my knowledge, SIP is very widely done in India—so from now on, currencies in Indian rupees (INR).

Let’s say someone with 2 kids earns ₹40,000/month (\~$450 USD).

Out of this, he pays health insurance, life/term insurance, taxes, takes care of wife and kids, school fees, and so on—and somehow goes into extreme frugality to put ₹10,000/month (\~$110 USD) into SIP. Wow.

So as a result—he loses vacations, holidays, movies, dinners, outings, and a lot of basic needs and happiness. But f\*ck, man, he is planning for 20 years. He invests ₹24 lakhs, and gets back about ₹92 lakhs after 20 years.

That’s $27,000 invested and getting back $103,000—all assuming 12% growth as shown by national index funds in the past decade.

Isn’t it awesome? $70K, almost 4.5 times return. That changes a family from poor to rich, at least in the Indian subcontinent. That’s huge money.



So, with sacrifice of happiness, peace, vacations, movies, dining, and everyday joy—the father somehow made his kids rich, moving a hierarchy above.

But here’s the catch: inflation.

Inflation averages around 6%, so the growth is not 12% like we think—it’s 6%.

Everyone says, “Even 6% growth after inflation is huge.”

Right. But let’s look at buying power and the HUGE politics behind it that everyone fails to realize.



Examples:

1. iPhones. Expensive in India because of import costs and taxes. Post-COVID, iPhones are manufactured in India—technically no import duties. People expected huge price drops. Surprise—“Made in India” iPhones cost the same as “Made in China.” Why? Because the company itself doesn’t want to reduce prices. Not just the government, the company too.

2. Biryani. Average price went from ₹70 to ₹130–150 after GST and supply chain issues. Now GST reduced, raw materials stabilized. Still, biryani prices remain high. Why? Vendors realized people accepted the higher price.

3. Onion raita. Onion shortage made vendors add cucumber/cabbage to cut costs. Shortage ended, onions cheap again—but they still add cucumber and cabbage.

These show: even after costs fall, businesses—from big brands to roadside vendors—stick to higher prices. Because once people accept it, profits rise. But they forget the “more money” they earn buys less.



So going back:

12% growth → 6% growth after inflation. But real buying power is far less – About 28.5 Lakhs in Todays Terms \~31500USD. Its kind of 0.17 % all the way from 4.5 Times.

Dont FORGET – Capital Gain Tax, Expense ratio, Opportunity and happiness Cost.

You can land in the odd spot where the nominal returns look higher than what you invested, yet the buying power after 20 years is actually lower than your original contributions today.



So after 20 years of sacrifice, vacations missed, discipline held—the hardest part—you’re not rich. You’re staying where you are.

No one’s paying you from their pocket. They’re giving you back exactly what you invested plus a little growth.

So, who’s losing in this zero-sum game?

It’s you.

Not JPMorgan, not BlackRock, not Ambanis or Jack Ma. You.

You gave your money—₹24 lakhs / $21K—for free, interest-free, for 20 years. ₹10K/month for someone else, interest-free.

The interest loss, the buying power companies gain from your money—all your loss.



I’m not against SIP. It still yields profit, so I do recommend it. But don’t think:

“I’m 30, I’ll do SIP for 20 years, retire at 50 with financial freedom.”

That’s not happening.

Know what’s real, then decide. Don’t dream misinformed and get f\*cked 20 years later.



⚠️ Warning: This is not financial advice. Just an analysis based on how politics, inflation, and real-world economics work. Do your own research before investing.

Salary hikes + Increasing SIP yearly with certain percentage is not considered here for simplicity.

IF I’M WRONG I’M OPEN FOR CRITICS, No HATE PLEASE.

The dreaded month...September is well known for being a very shit month for crypto and yet again it hasn't been great, good news is that it is now nearly over and 99.9999% of projects are on a major discount and you will probs make money with nearly anything you invest in rn. Bitcoin is down 2% and ETH is down 10%, it is far more brutal for smaller caps though, but they'll bounce back.

Whilst I have already mentioned you will probs make money with anything you buy rn, but the thing is choosing randomly is not the way. **Buying random coin with a funny name that is making the rounds on social media is not the way, these coins do not last, instead choose coins backed by communities that have worked non stop for over a year.** This is why you should buy Kendu, we are not going anywhere at all, it is a high conviction investment and this is NFA but there is absolutely 0 buying at these levels and beyond. I am literally a uni student with about £250 to my name and I put all spare money into Kendu knowing it is free money and the odds are way in my favour.

Kendu is building a real foundation not just with an amazing social media presence which tbh deserves a billion dollar market cap by itself, but also with an insane real life presence. This real life presence will spread into every single industry, spreading the Kendu brand globally ensuring that every single country has holds Kendu.

* Kendu Energy
* Kendu Merch
* Kendu Hotdog Stand in Florida

If I invest 100 per month to get a million, who’s paying?



So—here’s the analysis and the fck reality.

As per my knowledge, SIP is very widely done in India—so from now on, currencies in Indian rupees (INR).

Let’s say someone with 2 kids earns ₹40,000/month (\~$450 USD).

Out of this, he pays health insurance, life/term insurance, taxes, takes care of wife and kids, school fees, and so on—and somehow goes into extreme frugality to put ₹10,000/month (\~$110 USD) into SIP. Wow.

So as a result—he loses vacations, holidays, movies, dinners, outings, and a lot of basic needs and happiness. But f\*ck, man, he is planning for 20 years. He invests ₹24 lakhs, and gets back about ₹92 lakhs after 20 years.

That’s $27,000 invested and getting back $103,000—all assuming 12% growth as shown by national index funds in the past decade.

Isn’t it awesome? $70K, almost 4.5 times return. That changes a family from poor to rich, at least in the Indian subcontinent. That’s huge money.



So, with sacrifice of happiness, peace, vacations, movies, dining, and everyday joy—the father somehow made his kids rich, moving a hierarchy above.

But here’s the catch: inflation.

Inflation averages around 6%, so the growth is not 12% like we think—it’s 6%.

Everyone says, “Even 6% growth after inflation is huge.”

Right. But let’s look at buying power and the HUGE politics behind it that everyone fails to realize.



Examples:

1. iPhones. Expensive in India because of import costs and taxes. Post-COVID, iPhones are manufactured in India—technically no import duties. People expected huge price drops. Surprise—“Made in India” iPhones cost the same as “Made in China.” Why? Because the company itself doesn’t want to reduce prices. Not just the government, the company too.

2. Biryani. Average price went from ₹70 to ₹130–150 after GST and supply chain issues. Now GST reduced, raw materials stabilized. Still, biryani prices remain high. Why? Vendors realized people accepted the higher price.

3. Onion raita. Onion shortage made vendors add cucumber/cabbage to cut costs. Shortage ended, onions cheap again—but they still add cucumber and cabbage.

These show: even after costs fall, businesses—from big brands to roadside vendors—stick to higher prices. Because once people accept it, profits rise. But they forget the “more money” they earn buys less.



So going back:

12% growth → 6% growth after inflation. But real buying power is far less – About 28.5 Lakhs in Todays Terms \~31500USD. Its kind of 0.17 % all the way from 4.5 Times.

Dont FORGET – Capital Gain Tax, Expense ratio, Opportunity and happiness Cost.

You can land in the odd spot where the nominal returns look higher than what you invested, yet the buying power after 20 years is actually lower than your original contributions today.



So after 20 years of sacrifice, vacations missed, discipline held—the hardest part—you’re not rich. You’re staying where you are.

No one’s paying you from their pocket. They’re giving you back exactly what you invested plus a little growth.

So, who’s losing in this zero-sum game?

It’s you.

Not JPMorgan, not BlackRock, not Ambanis or Jack Ma. You.

You gave your money—₹24 lakhs / $21K—for free, interest-free, for 20 years. ₹10K/month for someone else, interest-free.

The interest loss, the buying power companies gain from your money—all your loss.



I’m not against SIP. It still yields profit, so I do recommend it. But don’t think:

“I’m 30, I’ll do SIP for 20 years, retire at 50 with financial freedom.”

That’s not happening.

Know what’s real, then decide. Don’t dream misinformed and get f\*cked 20 years later.



⚠️ Warning: This is not financial advice. Just an analysis based on how politics, inflation, and real-world economics work. Do your own research before investing.

Salary hikes + Increasing SIP yearly with certain percentage is not considered here for simplicity.

IF I’M WRONG I’M OPEN FOR CRITICS, No HATE PLEASE.

1ntclnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dex101/comments/1ntclnc/my_unlimited_universe_arena_homme_full_interview/,'MY UNLIMITED UNIVERSE' - Arena Homme+ | Full interview w/Dex,"**A man who embraces curiosity and romance, seeking new experiences and sensations firsthand. Dex, constantly expanding his own world, and LG Duobo, a coffee lover, met. The two subjects flowed harmoniously and fluidly on the same screen. At what speed and in what direction does Dex accumulate time? I explored Dex's universe with LG Duobo.**

**What kind of memories are you filling this year with? I'm curious if it's gone the way you wanted it to.**

Time seems to be passing by so quickly. I used to say, ""Let's take it easy in 2025,"" but I've worked so hard that I don't even realize how quickly this year has flown by. I didn't keep my resolution, but it's proof that there were so many things I could do with passion and enjoyment, so I'm very satisfied.

**I heard you've been busy with your schedule.**

This year, I'm planning my schedule with the mindset of, ""Let's do a lot of things that our fans will enjoy."" This photoshoot is one of them, right? (Laughs) Personally, I feel like compared to last year, my variety shows have decreased and my acting has taken a bit more focus.

**What were your first impressions of the LG Duobo, which you worked with for today's photoshoot?**

A spaceship came to mind. I'm quite interested in space, and the spaceship-shaped coffee machine perfectly captured my tastes. I also loved the slogan, ""Coffee is fun, specs are serious.""

**When you think of ""coffee,"" what moment comes to mind?**

You know the expression ""the leisure of a cup of coffee?"" When you need a moment of relaxation in your daily life, coffee can be like a short break.

Whether it's a small moment in your busy life, when was the last time you felt ""romantic""?
Ah! It was something really small, but recently, as soon as I left the house, I smelled autumn. I don't know why, but that day made me excited.

**Are Dex's 30s going the way you envisioned them?**

It's going in a completely different direction than I imagined. First of all, I didn't know I'd be doing this job. When I was younger, the 30s felt like true adulthood, full of maturity, but now I feel like I'm still a long way from being an adult. Still, I'm very satisfied with my 30s. After all, men start in their 30s!

**I think your 30s are a prime time for social development, a time for rowing. Do you feel like you've truly entered the ""running phase""?**

I certainly feel that way.  I believe now is the time to row with all my might, even harder. The truly fortunate thing is that rowing doesn't feel tiring these days. I'm truly enjoying each day. I just want to keep going forward, for a wonderful 40s.

**What do you do on your days off, amidst your tight schedule?**

On my days off, I tend to fully invest in myself. The days feel so fleeting that I almost regret it. Usually, on my days off, I work out with CrossFit and MMA, or a combination of both, then come home, clean up, do some personal maintenance, and prepare for the next day.

**What does it mean to rest?**

For me, rest is ""time to prepare my body and mind for work again."" That's why I can't slack off and keep moving. Fortunately, I'm still really enjoying this routine. I guess it's just my nature. (Laughs)

**Is there anything you feel you lack these days that you want to improve on?**

I feel like I want to empty out more than fill in. I feel like I'm always thinking about work from the moment I wake up until I go to bed. Even when I turn on the TV, I find myself thinking about work. The only time I can think of nothing else is when I'm working out, so I don't even realize I'm completely dedicated to it.

**You travel often. Have you found your travel style?**  

I think my travel style is surprisingly J. I'm secretly quite timid, so I try to avoid anything I haven't researched and considered beforehand. As a result, I naturally end up spending a lot of time at my accommodations.

**What have you discovered or realized during your most recent travels?**

Thankfully, I've traveled abroad a lot in recent years, so my aversion to foreign food has diminished significantly. There are still quite a few dishes that I find challenging, though.

**I'm curious about what's captivating you these days, or what you're focusing on.**

My current interest is speed. When it's cold, I can't even imagine it, but on a nice day, I want to speed on the road, feeling the cool breeze.

**What's the thing you crave most, or the compliment you like the most when you hear it?**

I think I'm the kind of person who strangely doesn't really want to hear anything from anyone. Rather than listening to others, like, ""I did a good job,"" or ""I'm cool,"" I tend to constantly question and discuss things with myself. I always try to maintain objectivity about myself.

**It seems like you're working on building a healthy body and mind.  Even so, when you feel your energy level dropping, is there something you always do for yourself?**

The best way to take care of yourself is to not exercise on your days off, have a delicious dinner, wash up, and go to bed before 9 p.m. It's simpler than you think, right?

**What kind of person do you find attractive? Is there a certain aesthetic you envision?**

Someone who is consistent. Someone who doesn't get emotionally upset and can remain calm in any situation. I'm working on that.

**Looking at your path so far, I feel like there's a connection. What makes you decide to appear in a show?**

I think ""interest"" is what drives me. I'm the type of person who can't do anything without feeling interested, so acting, variety shows, and YouTube all seem to stem from my ""interest."" When I think, ""This will be fun!"" I get excited and motivated even before I even begin.

**You've taken on the challenge of dramas. What was it like when you first encountered the world of ""acting""?**

At first, it was difficult to say even a simple line. It was incredibly disconcerting and shocking.  At first, acting was scary and intimidating, but as I continued, it gradually turned into excitement and anticipation. If given the opportunity, it's something I absolutely wouldn't want to let go of.

**I've been running a YouTube channel consistently. It's not easy to do anything consistently. What rewards or meaning do you find in it?**

It's been about five years since I started YouTube, and the biggest reason I've been able to continue is the ""high degree of freedom."" The appeal of YouTube is that it allows me to express my passions in a diverse way, a different kind of entertainment than broadcasting. I believe I've been able to continue because I have a great team that supports my diverse thoughts and interests.

**You've challenged and achieved many things. Do you still have a dream?**

My public dream is to continue this work that I love and enjoy so much until the end. My personal dream is to support my family so that they can smile and be happy for a long time.

That’s $27,000 invested and getting back $103,000—all assuming 12% growth as shown by national index funds in the past decade.

Isn’t it awesome? $70K, almost 4.5 times return. That changes a family from poor to rich, at least in the Indian subcontinent. That’s huge money.

So, with sacrifice of happiness, peace, vacations, movies, dining, and everyday joy—the father somehow made his kids rich, moving a hierarchy above.

But here’s the catch: **inflation.**  
Inflation averages around 6%, so the growth is not 12% like we think—it’s 6%.

Everyone says, “Even 6% growth after inflation is huge.”

Right. But let’s look at buying power and the HUGE politics behind it that everyone fails to realize.

So going back:  
12% growth → 6% growth after inflation. But **real buying power** is far less – About 28.5 Lakhs in Todays Terms \~31500USD. Its kind of 0.17 % all the way from 4.5 Times.

Dont FORGET – Capital Gain Tax, Expense ratio, Opportunity and happiness Cost.

You can land in the odd spot where the **nominal returns look higher than what you invested**, yet the **buying power after 20 years is actually lower than your original contributions today**.

My birthday is vv close and I asked my parents for noise cancelling headphones for my birthday so I can to some degree lock in better and get less distracted. I’ve been searching online but they are either too ex or ppl say they don’t block out that much noise.

Does anyone have good noise cancelling headphone recs?

Right now, Wix subscriptions are missing basic functionality:

- Customers can’t cancel their own subscription

- No option to pause or skip a cycle

- Can’t change renewal dates or products

- Even worse, if a subscription is discounted (which most are), you can’t adjust the next payment date at all

1. Customers get frustrated and just cancel outright instead of adjusting their plan.

2. I have to manually handle every single request, which doesn’t scale.

It blows my mind that in 2025, a major platform doesn’t offer what’s basically table stakes for subscription commerce.

Has anyone here dealt with this? Did you find a workaround, or did you just migrate to Shopify (Recharge, Appstle, etc.)? I’m seriously considering switching but dreading the process of getting all my subscribers to re-sign up.

It also doesn't help that I have bipolar disorder and various chronic illnesses which means that I tire out easily and deal with emotional dysregulation on a daily basis. 

Because of my conditions and personality type, I prefer keeping to myself as to not lose my temper and to focus on my tasks at hand. I have this one coworker, Julia 28F who is very talkative and doesn't seem to notice that I do not want to make small talk before work as I am a personal assistant and start my work earlier than the rest to ensure our director can start off his day the right way. 

Julia does not seem to get the hint as she stands at my desk, trying to get me to make coffee with her and then proceeds to sit at my desk for 30 minutes every morning making small talk. To be clear, I am friendly with my coworkers and talk when necessary and never let out frustrations on others. With Julia I have tried to make it clear in the most polite ways I can think of that I am not talkative and have a busy workday. I have told her directly (nicely) that I prefer having my own space and focus better alone. Its come to a point where I ignore her messages unrelated to work because even telling her via text that I am preoccupied isn't helping.

WIBTA if I ask her to leave me alone unless it's work related? I am aware of the fact that I sound like a hermit but I enjoy my solitude and it helps me focus.

On my way to the train, I pass a bus stop where a local bus usually picks people up. Out of habit, I glance over… and I swear I see myself sitting there. Same jacket, same headphones, same slouched posture. The only difference was that this “me” had a coffee cup in hand.
Here’s the weird part: I don’t take the bus. Ever. The timing doesn’t work, and it doesn’t even go near my job.

I froze for a second, staring, and the other-me looked up at exactly the same moment, like we felt each other’s eyes. It wasn’t just “someone who looked like me.” It was ME. I know my own face. My gut knew it before my brain even caught up.

I panicked a little and looked away, pretending to check my phone. When I glanced back a second later, the bus had already pulled up… and the other-me was gone. I never saw him get on, and when the bus left, the bench was empty.
I rode the rest of the way to work feeling unsettled, like I was in the wrong timeline or something. When I sat down at my desk, I couldn’t stop thinking: what if that was the version of me from the day I “almost” missed the train months ago? What if I was looking at the life where I chose differently?

# AI Business Automation Gave Me Back My Weekends

Weekends used to stress me out.

Month 2 you save more time with advanced AI business automation.

Month 3 your AI business automation systems multiply the benefits.

Month 6 your entire business runs on AI business automation.

Year 1 you've saved over 1,200 hours from AI business automation.

I took a sip of coffee before my eyes fell on the face of a person whom I had seen there before. It seemed like we were seated at our usual corners, each guarding our territories that turned us invisible to the world- one oligarch to another.

They had seen me as well. 'They', because what's in gender, and I won't give you the satisfaction. They came over to my table and asked if they could join me. I saw a newspaper in their hand and agreed. 'Tactile knowledge.'""Your phone doesn't work?""

I gestured at their hand. They smiled, ""I am a journalist."" ""What kind?"" I asked. ""Where may I have seen your work?"" They pretended to engage me and said-- ""A- I am the kind of journalist that's never goes out of work B- Those who ask me to write, don't need to read my work. C-- Those who do the work, don't want me to write about it.""

I was wondering if I made a mistake when they parted it in the middle and pointed to a series of tiny boxes and a large box with lilies on the edges. ""I write obituaries""- They said. My eyes may have been fixed on the paper for a minute before they asked-- ""What do you do?""

I pointed to the facing page-- a quarter-page ad selling cooking oil, next to the match-making section-- ""I convince people that frying food prolongs their life."" They picked up a french fry from my plate before I could swat their hand away.
