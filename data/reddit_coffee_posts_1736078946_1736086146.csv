1hu7s9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1hu7s9w/my_experience_current_progress_a_few_thoughts_and/,"my experience, current progress, a few thoughts and questions","I've previously done a few four-day fasts. Initially out of curiosity when I read that hunger goes away after second day and wanted to see how it actually feels. Then a few times for weight loss. I chose four days, because it's a time frame where I don't have to worry about vitamins or electrolytes and didn't experience any negative effects. Also four days because if I start on monday, I'm free to see friends, party and eat on weekend no problem, without any complicated refeeding regimen. Personally I find three to four days to be so easy, it's barely worth mentioning, but I guess the feeling must be extremely individual and subjective (not to offend anyone or disparage anyone's attempts). The only time it turned out to be too hard and I broke down early was with wife on a vacation when I had to cook for our daughter.

Currently I'm on the fourth day of what I hope will be a 25 day fast. The goal is to lose about 10kg before I go on a snowboarding trip on the last week of January, so I can enjoy it as much as possible without my weight bearing down on my knees.
It's not a 100% water fast - still enjoy a few coffees with milk and sugar, and teas with honey. The goal, after all, is not to torture myself, but to make the process as painless as possible. Didn't abstain my self from a few sips when my friends popped a fine champagne either :) .
Simple math says that the calorie amount in a spoonful of sugar is burned by my body in about 10 to 15 mins, so I figure it's not a big deal and shouldn't really affect ketosis or autophagy much anyway. So that's the first question - am I right in assuming this, or am I robbing myself of potential benefits in any significant way?

Since I plan on a long fast, I obviously have to worry about electrolytes.
Magnesium is obvious and easy - most magnesium food supplement tablets have 400mg which is exactly what is needed, as far as I understand from this subreddit wiki.
Sodium is the next one. I read here about making a salted water drink, but I tried it and that seems a lot harder to swallow than simply eating a few pinches of salt a few times a day. I see no drawbacks in doing this, am I missing something and is anyone else doing so as well?
The last one is Potassium, which is the more complicated one. In my country we have no no-salt, cream of tartar or such things in our stores, so I'm left with what I can find in pharmacies. I understrand that capsules are a no-go, right? So I'm left with potassium citrate in either tablet form (about 10 tabs per day) or powder form. It seems that tabs are cheaper and are less mass to swallow, so probably easier taste-wise. Is this fine, or tablets can cause the same problems that capsules?

On top of all that I plan to run as much as possible, which for me I guess would mean about 4 to 5 km every other day, plus doing bodyweight squats everyday. On previous shorter fasts I found that running is quite a bit harder than normal, but it didn't feel like I was harming myself in any way.

Oh and if it at all matters - I'm 1,96m and 114kg (or rather - was 4 days ago). My optimum target weight, where I would be happy about my body and looks would be 90-95kg, so I'd say I'm reasonably fat but not obese or anything.

Does all of this sound reasonable enough? Am I missing or misunderstanding anything, or maybe you have any other inputs or suggestions? I'm open to everything!",1,1736086081.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

(And no, I'm not joking) 🌈","Okay fam, I've been absolutely LIVING in this daydream lately and I need y'all to vibe with me for a sec! 🤔

Picture this: Our own little slice of paradise somewhere in India (I'm thinking Kerala/Goa vibes because duh) where being queer isn't just ""tolerated"" - it's literally the whole point! Not some hidden underground scene, but a whole TOWN built by us, for us!

Think Fort Kochi meets San Francisco meets that cozy feeling when you're at your queer bestie's place and can finally exhale. 😌

Here's the tea:

\- We find a chill village/island near a progressive state capital

\- Pool our resources (rich gays wya? 👀)

\- Transform it into THE most iconic LGBTQ+ hub in Asia

But wait, it gets better! Imagine:

\- Cafes serving chai and drama ☕️

\- The most aesthetic pride-themed boutiques

\- Queer bookstores with actual desi queer literature

\- Mental health centers that don't ask ""have you tried not being gay?"" 🙄

\- Gender-affirming healthcare without the usual hassle

\- Schools where kids with two moms/dads are the norm

\- The WILDEST pride celebrations (Diwali + Pride = epic?)

\- Tech startups with pronouns in their company policies

\- Security that actually takes hate crimes seriously

And the best part? Every business owned and run by our community. Every teacher, doctor, shop owner - all family! (And by family, I mean 🌈family🌈)

Listen, I know some of you are already typing ""but that's segregation"" - nah fam. Think of it more like Bangalore's tech hub but make it gay™️. Everyone can visit (after proper verification ofc), but it's OUR space to feel safe, thrive, and build the future we deserved.

Plus, imagine the tourism potential! We could be the next big thing after Goa, but with better rights and cuter couples everywhere!

Real talk though - I know this sounds wild. But remember when Section 377 seemed impossible to overturn? We did that. Marriage equality seemed like a fantasy? We're getting there. Sometimes the craziest dreams become reality because someone dared to dream them.

Is there already something like this in India? Drop locations below! 👇 If not... who's ready to start this revolution? Slide into my DMs if you're seriously interested - maybe we can start a Discord/WhatsApp group and actually make this happen?

PS: If you think this is ridiculous, remember our ancestors probably thought openly gay cafes in Mumbai were ridiculous too. Yet here we are, sipping our iced coffee and judging people. 💅

Let's make this go viral and find our future neighbors! Share if you'd move here in a heartbeat! 🏳️‍🌈✨

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

1hu7no4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1hu7no4/resume_writing_services/,Resume Writing Services,"Crafting standout resumes is a bit like telling the most captivating story about yourself—only instead of reading to a bedtime audience, you’re hoping to catch the eye of a recruiter who’s probably sipping their third cup of coffee and staring at a mountain of applications the size of Mount Everest. So, how do you transform your life’s narrative into a resume that demands attention? Let’s break it down.

First off, ditch the cookie-cutter templates that scream “I’m just another applicant!” Your resume should reflect your unique journey—your skills, accomplishments, and just enough personality to stand out from the pack. Think of it like a first date; you want to showcase your best self but still be genuine enough that they don’t feel like they're on a blind date with a robot. Use action verbs that pop! Instead of saying “responsible for managing projects,” try “mastered the art of project management, delivering results on time and under budget.” It’s more engaging, right? 

Then there’s the marketing aspect. This is where you harness a little bit of that sales magic. Identify what sets you apart from the competition—your “why.” What’s your story? What passionate projects have lit a fire in your belly? Frame your experiences in a way that speaks directly to potential employers. They’re not just hiring a skillset; they’re inviting you into their team, hoping you’ll breathe life and energy into their company culture. 

Now, let’s talk about LinkedIn—the digital playground of job seekers and employers alike. If your resume is the story of your professional life, think of your LinkedIn profile as the live-action adaptation. It should be vibrant, full of connections, and maybe even a few behind-the-scenes bloopers. Optimize your profile with keywords that resonate within your industry—this isn’t just about vanity; it’s about visibility. And don’t forget a professional photo! No one wants to connect with the person whose profile picture looks like they just crawled out of a cave. 

Networking is where the magic happens. Engage with content, share insights, and don’t shy away from reaching out to connections (even if it feels a bit like asking that cute barista for their number). Build genuine relationships. Remember, most opportunities come through people, not through job postings. Keep it authentic; people can sniff out a sales pitch faster than a dog at a barbecue.

Throughout this journey, keep a spirit of exploration. Each application, each connection made, is another chance to grow and learn. God often uses these little moments to guide us toward our next great adventure. Be open, be brave, and don’t forget to sprinkle a little faith into the mix. You never know where the next opportunity might come from, so stay tuned into those divine prompts.

As you navigate this terrain, consider this: Are you reflecting the authentic you in your professional story? Are you using the tools available to truly connect, or are you just going through the motions? Let this be a season of growth, community, and transformation. Whatever the result, trust that your journey is unfolding just as it should.",1,1736085684.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

Writing this because I met a mentee - and basically vocalised parts to him.

I noticed that this were things I picked up on my own/from seniors, but not everyone has the luxury of staying on campus and learning from seniors. 

tldr:

1. Have a theme for the semester - forces prioritisation and helps you to say no

	1. A theme could be anything really - raising your GPA, exploring career paths or even just doing nothing and relaxing

	2. The important thing is actually having one - helps you to plan your time better

2. Plan early, plan now

	1. Knowledge is power - you likely already have a rough idea of the semester in your head. Actually write it down

	2. There is a wealth of information about the modules you're taking - find it

	3. Beyond modules, you likely already know you have things like job applications, CCAs or even socialising to do. Calendar it early - helps you to visualise the semester as a whole and mentally prepare yourself

3. Use W grades more

	1. A W grade is what happens when you drop a module between Week 3 - 7. It doesn't affect your GPA, but shows up on your transcript

	2. Use them!! Explore classes, check out Ben Leong, taste subjects and just enjoy uni a bit more





Disclaimer: This isn't quite for everyone - this piece focuses on generally more conventional metrics of success (such as gpa, getting a job you actually want etc) That being said, I think the advice can be quite applicable broadly 





\# Every Semester Should Have a Theme



A theme is similar (but not the same!) to a goal (or list of goals.) The general idea around a theme is for you to focus your time and efforts and drive prioritisation.

In an ideal world, we all want do the following over the span of 13(+3) weeks

1. Get straight A's

2. Engage in meaningful CCAs to grow our portfolio

3. Job/Internship applications for the summer

4. Socialise and make friends/find a partner

5. Spend time with our family/friends

6. on and on ...



The idea behind a theme is to help us focus our efforts. For most of us, we will likely realise that we can't do everything by the end of Y1. A theme will help prioritise and focus our efforts 

Some examples:

1. \_Figuring out your path:\_ Journaling, coffee chats with seniors or even professionals, exploring different CCAs

2. \*Boosting your GPA:\* Sacrificing social life and CCAs to focus mainly on academics

3. \*Building relationships & having fun:\* Networking or spending time strengthening personal connections/having fun

\---

For those of you higher up on the skill tree, you can begin to plan multiple themes up. A simple example would be the following:

\- My goal is to get a solid internship in a bank by the summer of Y3

	\- Means that by Y3S1, my profile needs to get past the CV screen

		\- Implies that Y2 summer needs to be a relatively good role ...

Planning isn't meant to visualise and map out a semester down to the hour, but rather just to give you a mental picture of how the semester would go, and if you would be aligned with it.

The general idea is to have a rough outline of how the semester would go, as well as contingencies/what-if's. 

The plan will give you clarity on making decisions when things change later on when things change - Eg.  Do you take the offer for a part-time internship/ step up to lead a CCA project? 



So what exactly is a semester plan? I think it varies across different folks, but the general idea is to have a broad idea of how your semester looks like across the 13(+3) weeks. 



For example - if you're someone that doesn't deal well with finals/does better on projects, you definitely do not want to choose 5 mods that are all finals-heavy on the same 1-3 days. 



I would break it down into the following - (not exhaustive!)



\- \*\*Academics\*\*

	\- In theory, after your first year of uni - you will likely have a rough idea of how it's like 

		\- If you hate/love class participation

		\- If you're good at bootlicking

		\- If you're good at projects and you know a lot of smart people

	\- From this, you can discern what are your strengths and weaknesses - which should help you strategise accordingly. 

	\- For me, I discovered that I was a great communicator, good at marshalling people together and creating a good impression of myself

		\- This made me lean towards taking modules that were class-part/project focused

	\- I was \*\*horrid at programming and math\*\* 

		\- This made me avoid heavy math/programming modules - lest I get a C 

	\- In short, you want to collect data on your modules and know which ones you have a high probability of doing well, which ones you plan to sacrifice and so on

\- \*\*Social/CCA\*\*

	\- As a working adult, I can say with absolutely certainty that universities are the easiest place to learn something fun, pick up a new hobby and make friends

	\- This is definitely something you want to take advantage of - so definitely put in the effort to research/examine clubs that you are interested in

\- \*\*Others\*\*

	\- If you’re planning to apply for jobs or internships, map out timelines and deadlines now to avoid last-minute stress



Lastly, you want to have a broad outline of your semester from the getgo. You want to know which weeks are for fun, joy and laughter, and which are for you to be buried under your books (or in today's world, glued to your screen)





\# W Grades (and what they represent)



You get a W grade when you withdraw from the module after week 2 and before week 7. This shows up on your transcript but has no impact on your GPA. 



I wish I found out about them sooner

\- They gave me the ability to taste different modules 

	\- I could have tasted 4K modules as a Y2 and gotten a sensing of how it would be like later on

\- ""A Pullout option"" - Get out of jail card for killer modules that would tank my GP because I had a tough semester/bitten off more than I can chew

\- Gave me optionality and information

	\- eg. You're split on Mod A and B, one of which is a graduation requirement. You've gotten reviews from seniors, but are still unsure. Instead of deciding with limited information, you have the ability to take both and decide later on



IMO - W grades are a great way to experiment - which is the whole point of university. You can take interesting modules like “The Social History of Piano” with little cost. 



What do they represent?

At the risk of sounding ""deep"", W grades represented a low-cost way of experimenting and exploring university. They gave me the opportunity to explore a bit more, which made all the difference. I wished I knew about them sooner. 



Some caveats

\- W grades represent a time sink - assuming you attend classes/tutorials etc. 

	\- They are an opportunity cost in terms of time

\- Don't be selfish

	\- As much as possible, don't drop a class that involves a semester long group project - you would be doing your team dirty if you drop it at week 6.





\# Fin

I wrote this on a whim - just put together some thoughts that have been floating around my head/things I wished I knew. 



For some - all of this might be a given - ""Of course you should plan your semester, of course you should not plan to have 3 finals on the same day.""

However, I don't think that's the case for everyone - especially for those not staying on campus/don't really have seniors to talk to.

I met her on tinder (dating app) in early 2023. We met up the following day for what I thought would be just a simple coffee and a chat (to see if we’re compatible) and on the drive home she initiated sex in my car, mid way through this she pulled my condom off. After I dropped her off home I messaged her and she then went ghost for 2 months. During this time I got an STD test obviously after having unprotected sex (which I didn’t agree too) and luckily it was negative. Time went by (2 months) and she popped up again with a text which literally read “do you want to fuck me”.. as I liked her I obliged and I snook her into my parents house at the time and we did this a couple more times ( she told me she was emotionally unavailable and only wanted sex” One of the nights we fell asleep and she ended up staying over and the following day we went to this shopping centre together where she then grabbed my hand out of nowhere. 

During this time period she began to tell me about all of her previous sexual experiences in graphic detail. Even down to the size of the penises she had previously had sex with etc and the things she did with particular guys and the oldest guy she’d slept with being 40 when she was just 18… she told me this and said to me “I’m only telling you all of this so when we’re out and somebody comes Upto you and says “I’ve fucked your girl” you’re not surprised. 

Following this the relationship built (don’t ask me why because it shouldn’t have) and she then opened up to me about her past trauma.. her dad ended his own life in prison after murdering his ex partner in front of her 6 year old son because she had moved on. She also had a failed abortion that resulted in her giving birth to a child that was too small to survive so unfortunately passed away too just a year after her dad situation. So it’s safe to say there was trauma and baggage there and I’ll be honest at this point I thought “is this something I should really be getting myself involved with” but never the less I did because I liked her and I didn’t want to let this reflect who she was as a person. 

This all took place from may-July and in July she had to move into my parents house with me because her brother was abusive to her and used to hit her so I said she could stay with me. She moved in and we fell in love and got into a relationship and then all of the thoughts started to bother me about her past and the stories she told me. So I chose to go through her phone and found she was still receiving messages from a guy she sent explicit videos of herself too, she was still picking up weed from a drug dealer she used to have sex with for “good deals” and was speaking to this guy she considered a friend who called her pet names like “love” “daring” etc etc. I told her all of these had to go if she was to stay with me which she did do. 

I started to get some symptoms of a UTI to I went to the doctors who prescribed antibiotics but they didn’t seem to work so I took an STD test and it came back positive for chlamydia. (This could only have been from her) so this obviously caused arguments and broken trust but she brushed it under the rug as she said “I didn’t know I had it” and as much as I told her how much it hurt me and broke my trust she never really understood it and would often compare my pain about things to her dad or her baby etc. 

As things moved on I found myself becoming quite controlling, about what she wore, who she spoke to etc and at times I was over the top. But this was only because of everything that happened leading up-to this. 

We still ended up moving into our own place despite how rocky things were and it lasted 6 months before she left me because I said something horrible. I got drunk one night and the situation hadn’t been great between us because it was Father’s Day and around this time she would always be very snappy, avoidant, and have such a horrible attitude towards me. And often at times I’d have to remind her that I didn’t do it, I wasn’t the one who killed him or had any involvement because it felt like she took it out on me so hard. 

This then lead to a drunk night and I came home and she was giving me the same attitude to which I responded “your dad was a pussy who killed himself” out of anger for what he did by making the selfish decision to murder somebody and also kill himself and leave his children in this state. I tried to explain to her that this wasn’t a comment to hurt her it was simply my shared anger for the situation because every special occasion I had to watch her be miserable and upset and that caused me frustration because I do think that what he did was incredibly selfish. Despite my attempts to tell her why I said this and my reasoning she left regardless and said she could never forgive me for what I said, despite my reassurance it was out of shared hurt and frustration for her in the situation. 

She left just after we renewed the rental agreement so I’ve been in this house by myself struggling to move on as I’m just surrounded by our memories, whereas she gets to go back home (to the place I helped rescue her from) and move on. 

Because of her past I’m constantly wondering what she’s doing now she’s single again and it hurts because I’ve got a pretty good idea what that might be. I’d never accept her back after these realisations I’ve had now and the fact is that it shouldn’t have gone further than the first encounter. 

The doctor diagnosed me with complex PTSD 2 days ago because of everything I endured during this relationship and I guess I’m just posting on here as a way to vent and let my feelings go annoymously. ",1,1736085072.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1hu7gk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/1hu7gk6/3_things_to_take_note_of_before_the_semester/,3 things to take note of before the semester starts!,"Hello there - decided to put together a piece on 3 things to do before/at the start of the semester. Writing this because I met a mentee - and basically vocalised parts to him.
I noticed that this were things I picked up on my own/from seniors, but not everyone has the luxury of staying on campus and learning from seniors. 

tldr:
1. Have a theme for the semester - forces prioritisation and helps you to say no
	1. A theme could be anything really - raising your GPA, exploring career paths or even just doing nothing and relaxing
	2. The important thing is actually having one - helps you to plan your time better
2. Plan early, plan now
	1. Knowledge is power - you likely already have a rough idea of the semester in your head. Actually write it down
	2. There is a wealth of information about the modules you're taking - find it
	3. Beyond modules, you likely already know you have things like job applications, CCAs or even socialising to do. Calendar it early - helps you to visualise the semester as a whole and mentally prepare yourself
3. Use W grades more
	1. A W grade is what happens when you drop a module between Week 3 - 7. It doesn't affect your GPA, but shows up on your transcript
	2. Use them!! Explore classes, check out Ben Leong, taste subjects and just enjoy uni a bit more


Disclaimer: This isn't quite for everyone - this piece focuses on generally more conventional metrics of success (such as gpa, getting a job you actually want etc) That being said, I think the advice can be quite applicable broadly 


# Every Semester Should Have a Theme

A theme is similar (but not the same!) to a goal (or list of goals.) The general idea around a theme is for you to focus your time and efforts and drive prioritisation.
In an ideal world, we all want do the following over the span of 13(+3) weeks
1. Get straight A's
2. Engage in meaningful CCAs to grow our portfolio
3. Job/Internship applications for the summer
4. Socialise and make friends/find a partner
5. Spend time with our family/friends
6. on and on ...

The idea behind a theme is to help us focus our efforts. For most of us, we will likely realise that we can't do everything by the end of Y1. A theme will help prioritise and focus our efforts 
Some examples:
1. _Figuring out your path:_ Journaling, coffee chats with seniors or even professionals, exploring different CCAs
2. *Boosting your GPA:* Sacrificing social life and CCAs to focus mainly on academics
3. *Building relationships & having fun:* Networking or spending time strengthening personal connections/having fun
---
For those of you higher up on the skill tree, you can begin to plan multiple themes up. A simple example would be the following:
- My goal is to get a solid internship in a bank by the summer of Y3
	- Means that by Y3S1, my profile needs to get past the CV screen
		- Implies that Y2 summer needs to be a relatively good role ...

I will try to keep it as short as possible.

I'm a gay guy in my late 20s, approaching 30. I live in London, athletic/toned body (not buff, but very active in sports and gym), around 5'5""/1.65, ME-ern, bearded and hairy-ish, unfortunately quite ugly-ish face-wise. If it matters, I have 2 degrees, speak 4 languages, not too career-oriented but I have a creative job that I'm doing quite well in, lots of hobbies (in- and outdoors). I'm also straight-passing (I've been told by others that I'm masc but I don't feel like it's true).

When I came out years ago, I tried to become sexually active but soon realised random hook-ups were not my thing. I feel the need to get to know the person at least a bit, and I know many others feel the same. So I decided to focus on dating instead, and I joined the ""appropriate"" apps for ""serious"" dating. Before you rush to comment for me to delete these apps and meet people organically: **1.** Most of my friends are straight, so I don't have a huge gay circle to expand. I've had several gay housemates in the past and I've tried to open my circle by meeting their friends but it didn't work out well, I felt unwelcome. In a few instances I was bullied/body shamed by them (mean gays thriving), and since I struggle(d) mentally with body image I distanced myself from them for my own sanity. I still keep in touch with my ex-housemates though, and I currently have two as well that we get along fine. So I do have other gay people in my life (as well as a lot at my workplace), it just doesn't happen that I meet new ones as often as other gay men who are more outgoing and get to meet new guys often. **2.** I'm the kind of person who doesn't mind going out alone for a drink, a museum, or a coffee, so I've tried going out while also hoping to meet people, but had 0 success. I think I'm not too approachable. I read stories about people meeting others in the gym and my thought was that I've been going to the gym for nearly a decade and didn't even get as much as a compliment from others, let alone sex or a date.

Back to the apps: Over the years, I've had very, very few matches. Comparing my experiences with my gay friends' or to people online made me realise how unattractive I must be. While other people had several likes or matches on a single day, I had to wait 1 to 4 months. And then, like most of you already know, half of those matches never spoke/responded to me after matching, and more than half of the rest who responded ended up ghosting or rejecting me before we even met in-person. As for those who ended up becoming dates, I've only ever had ONE second date, and it's the only guy I met through the apps that I keep in touch with as friends to this day. I never rejected anyone from my side, it was always the others rejecting (or ghosting) me, always post-date. Even people who were overly nice during the date (saying I'm cute or hot, they want to kiss me, we should do this or that next time etc), ended up ghosting me after the first date. So, overall, years later, I've had VERY LITTLE dating experience and very little sex experience.

About 1,5 years ago, I decided to say fuck it, if I'm going to die alone, I might as well learn to enjoy hooking up. Besides, all gay men struggled with dating in one way or another, it wasn't just me. Maybe it was for different reasons, but still, I didn't want to play the only victim. As much as I was craving a partner to love with all my heart, I downloaded Grindr, added a few photos (with face), my info etc. Same shit. I get several views daily, but virtually no one writes, people rarely respond to me and if they do they usually drop the convo a few messages in, I get blocked, I only get taps from photo-less profiles. I get messages only from spam accounts advertising their sites or photo-less profiles (which I dont feel like responding to, as I have ""NPNC"" in my profile). Since downloading Grindr, I only met ONE guy through the app, and it wasn't even for sex... In the meantime, I downloaded more and more apps hoping to have luck elsewhere, and ended up with a dozen date and/or hook-up apps on my phone feeling miserable, as if I'm the world's ugliest guy begging everyone else for some love.

At some point I had reached a point of having suicidal thoughts, I hated myself and felt like the world's most disgusting being. (This wasn't \*just\* due to my dating experiences, other experienced factor into this.) Over the last couple of years I was really dedicated in improving myself to help my mental health (focused more on gym, skincare, diet, even learned to sew so I can properly alter my trousers 😂), so my physique, skin, health, fashion and grooming has improved, which on one hand has helped my self-esteem tremendously, but on the other, seeing that none of this mattered in finding a partner, made me feel more hopeless, as if I'm un-fixable.

As a new year's resolution, I said I would delete everything and give up, stop wasting time (and money) since I get nothing out of it, but I couldn't get myself to do it. I feel like I deserve some love too. I just don't understand how others do it so easily. If I delete the apps, I feel like I'm giving up on love. I never had anyone to kiss or cuddle, I never held hands with anyone before, I never woke up next to someone. I hate to sound desperate but, while I enjoy my own company, I just feel like I need a person to hold, to love, to make him feel better after a shitty day. Maybe I'm over-romanticising it, since some gay guys that I know in relationships are not too happy about it...

What do you think I'm doing wrong? It can't be \*that\* brutal... People tell me that finding sex is the easiest thing, you can go online and find someone near you in 5 minutes. HOW? Should I open up with  a dick pic? I try to keep it civilised so I usually greet or compliment if there is nothing comment-worthy on their profile. But where did that get me? Do I have to become what I hate to get some attention? Should I give up completely? Should I hide my face in my profile?

**I would appreciate any tips you have to help my situation. Thank you x**

[The tournament was announced at the venue](https://preview.redd.it/p5mpxkbdj6be1.jpg?width=1435&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb8304055862c06dd22bc76053166e4539aed547)

We were there early, meeting Ruben and Cristina, the TOs. The place was nice, but cold. Megu said the coffee was not to his taste, but fortunately there was a selection of special beers.

Fourteen players registered, about half of them speaking Italian; there were also a couple of Dutch players from the Old Man of the Sea crew. We would play four rounds of Swiss followed by a top 4.

Round 1: Ivo Bos from Den Haag (NL) - Arabian Zoo

Ivo starts with Tropical Island and Birds of Paradise while I get Sindbad out along with a Sylvan Library thanks to Black Lotus. Ivo gathers his offence with Su-Chi, Kird Ape and a Factory. I get rid of his hand with Mind Twist and tutor next turn for a Moat to stabilize at 6 life. I have to take risks and cast Wheel of Fortune. Ivo gets a lone Lightning Bolt, so my flyers kill him before he draws another direct damage spell.

Game 2 starts slowly with a turn 3 Serendib Efreet from Ivo, I have a Maze of Ith, but Strip Mine destroys it. I have a Demonic Tutor, but I wait too long to fetch a Swords to Plowshares to get rid of the Dib and ultimately die to Psionic Blast.

Game 3, I keep a hand with Savannah and Strip Mine so that I can cast Sylvan Library turn 2, but I find no solution to Ivo's Erhnam Djinn and Factory.

1-2, 0 points

Round 2: Wouter Slob from Doordrecht (NL) - BR tricks

We chat a bit pre-match and Wouter tells me he worked in Brussels for several years before returning to the Netherlands.

He opens with Badlands, Mox and Howling Mine. So I know that Underworld Dreams and bolts are coming. I drop mana on my first turn to set up a second turn Mind Twist for 6! I then play a couple of Serra Angels to keep his Hypnotic Specter at bay and Strip his Maze of Ith. But Wouter plays The Abyss to slow me down. I manage to get back the angels in play thanks to All Hallow's Eve to take the first game.

In the second game, I manage another big Mind Twist after a Blue Elemental Blast to counter his Winds of Change. We don't do much for several turns, Wouter being a bit short on mana, and me waiting to have 8 cards in hand to play and use my Library of Alexandria. I then play a Serra Angel that goes all the way.

2-0, 3 points

Round 3: Megu from Genova (IT) - Gorlami

In the testing session the day before, Megu played a BWR deck with Juzam Djinn, Sedge Troll and Hypnotic Specter. With the help of Antoine, he worked on his mana base to get the deck going.

Game 1 Megu is mana flooded, I don't do much either as Sindbad and an animated Moti both get Plowed. Megu plays a Juzam Djinn and I stop it with Moat. Then I use All Hallow's Eve to get back Serra Angel and Mahamoti Djinn along with Triskelion. Megu concedes.

Game 2, I get Mahamoti Djinn out on turn 2, but Megu kills it with Chaos Orb, then plays a Troll. I play a Trike, but Megu has a Plow. But he can't stop Animate Dead on Moti.

2-0, 6 points

Round 4: Davide Zulli from Antwerp - White weenie with red (Tax Edge)

Game 1, I have 2 Sindbads and a Mahamoti Djinn vs Davide's Benalish Hero soon joined by two White Knights and a Crusade. David attacks with the 2 3/3 knights, I don't block with the Moti because I suppose he is holding a Lighting Bolt (which he was). I play Chaos Orb on Crusade to win the race.

Game 2, Davide opens with Mountain, then Plains and Benalish Hero. I plow the Hero to buy some time and strip the Plains to prevent him from getting WW and it works, Davide plays a Plateau, then a second Mountain, but cannot find his second white mana source. He plays Land Tax, but I make sure he can't activate it. I play a Sylvan Library, then pay 8 life to get a hand of 8 cards, so that I can play and activate Library of Alexandria. We are then both on 4 lands in play as Davide had played a Factory. I play All Hallow's Eve, drop Bazaar of Baghdad to put creatures in the graveyard. This enables Davide to get 3 Plains with Land Tax and play back to back Thunder Spirits, but they can't stop my army of 3 Serra Angel and one Moti: I hit him once then tutor for Time Walk (with BEB backup in case he has a REB) for the final blow.

2-0, 9 points

I am 4th seed entering the top 4. Megu goes 2-2-0 at 10th place and Lorenzo ends 11th with 1-1-2 record playing Mirrorball.

Semi-finals: Stef Van Bogaert (Antwerp) - 4 colour creatures

Stef was 3-0-1 playing mainly GBU for birds of Paradise, Hypnotic Specter, Erham Djinn, Serendib Efreet, Guardian Beast and a little red for Fireball, Disintegrate and Gwendlyn di Corci.

Game 1 he starts with Birds of Paradise, then counters my Sindbad on turn 2 and plays Gwendlyn on turn 3. I discard a Serra Angel that I can animate. I can hit him for 3 a turn while keeping at bay Gwendlyn and Hypnotic Specter. A second Serra makes sure he can't come back.

Game 2, Stef cast Ancestral turn 2 or 3, I play Demonic tutor on Wheel of Fortune to counter his , then play a land a Sol Ring. Stef plays Library of Alexandria and Time Walk. Fortunately, the Wheel gave me Mind Twist and I am able to empty his hand. He plays an Erhnam Djinn. After taking a few hits, I animate a Moti to keep it at bay and stabilize at 6 life. He plays a Su-Chi that I Disenchant, then plays more creatures to prepare for a final attack. I thus play All Hallow's Eve and activate Bazaar of Baghdad several times, and we both get a lot of creatures back (from the Wheel of Fortune). This way I have just enough creature to block his potential attack. Stef has 3 Serendib Efreet that gnaw at his life total every upkeep, and I am able to win with the help of Triskelion before he draws a x-spell to kill me.

2-0

Finals: Joe Becica (USA) - Gorlami

Joe is playing a deck similar to Megu's with Hyppies, Trolls, Sinkhole, white removal, but he replaced the Juzams with Sengir Vampire.

Game 1, Joe makes sure I can't develop my mana base with Lightning Bolt on Sindbad and Swords to Plowshares on Birds of Paradise. He gets out a Sedge Troll followed by a Hypnotic Specter and I am soon dead.

Game 2, Joe plays a Troll that I send farming, I am holding 2 Animate Dead but I don't have any creatures. Joe hits me with a Factory, then plays another one along with a Vampire. I have Chaos Orb to kill then animate the Vampire, but I miss my flip and die.

0-2

I am quite happy with my second place with this deck, which is quite enjoyable to play with all the combination provided by Sylvan Library, Sindbad and Bazaar of Baghdad to fill in the graveyard. If you look closely though, you will notice that I won many games thanks to Mind Twist...

The tournament was a success, nice people, glad that some players from abroad made the trip. Ruben said he would try to organise a second event, either next summer or next year.

1hu7cr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomThoughts/comments/1hu7cr0/if_carrying_around_comfort_objects_was_normalized/,"If carrying around comfort objects was normalized for adults, I think fewer people would smoke/vape. ","I noticed the other day that I felt more comfortable and confident when I walk around with a coffee cup vs walking around empty-handed. That's when this thought crossed my mind! If adults could carry around whatever it is that brings them comfort: a cup of coffee, a stuffed toy, etc throughout the day, would fewer people smoke? 

Other than the pure addiction to nicotine, whether the person is aware of it or not, the act of smoking has the comforting plus confidence effect. It also has the grounding effect of breathing intentionally and deeply and the structure and purpose of ritual. There's just something comforting and safe-feeling about the hand being near the mouth.  It seems cringey, or I unfortunately feel cringed, when I've seen adults self-soothe the way a child would, but life isn't easy and I think if adults self-soothed in the ways that felt most comfortable to them, I think fewer people would smoke because they would feel less socially anxious and more confident.",5,1736084694.0,RandomThoughts,6,1.0,False
1hu7chq,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1hu7chq/my_dark_side/,My dark side ,"My cousin sister 3 years elder than me just got married at 28 with her bf of 2 years aged 30.
They moved to the city Kuala Lumpur which 5 hours away from our hometown. I’ve been living in the city for about 5 years now I got a job and moved in with them about the same time…This was year 2021. My sister goes to work everyday and comes back around 8pm whereby Harris (my brother in law) and me worked from home !!
Harris goes to the office twice a week though. 
 I had just broken up with my bf after 1 year where all we did was have sex in his room or my dorm.
I started teasing Harris. He was a polite gentleman. I would wear the shortest shorts I have and sometimes walk around without a bra. I’m pretty skinny and small with small nipples anyways. 
I would walk up to his study room and ask him a question like what time kakak(sister in malay) going to be back ?
He would have a hard time trying to look me in the eyes !!
Eventually 1 day I caught him looking at my ass when I was in the kitchen and I acted angry and didn’t leave my room the whole day. He freaked out!! 
The next day I woke up early and was chatting with my sister before she left to work which I usually don’t do and that freaked him out more. I was wearing a long sweat pants and tee and once my sister left I changed into a silk pyjama shorts and with the same top exposing my butt a little. 
He looked confused on why I had even changed into this.
Right before I went to make my coffee I told him and asked “bang nak ikut teman ayu kat kitchen?” ( bother do u wanna company me in the kitchen?)  
He just stood there staring at my ass while  turned my back mixing myself a coffee. I sat on the kitchen counter just talking to him for like 2 hours straight. Him standing there the whole time he was too polite to run away from the conversation and I think he liked it. 
I asked if I can work in his study room too. Was flirting with him the whole day. I rushed to Change back into my long sweat pants just before kakak came home. 

The next day he went to office and I had the house for myself the whole day. The following day my sister was at home then the weekend took over. For the first time in my life I was looking forward to a Monday!
Monday came and I was working in my room. He came over and asked me if I wanted to join him in the office where it’s comfortable and of course I said yes and told him I need to change first. 

Took of my bra and made sure my nipples was still visible under my grey T-shirt. 
After awhile he asked me why do I change when my cousin comes back ? 
I said cause she is pretty traditional Malay women and would not approve shorts and stuff and will tell my mum or hers. My sister still wear a hijab btwy. He laughed and agreed with me. I felt a thrill and excitement bitching to him about his own wife my perfect cousin sister that is adored by all. I wanted to hear him bitch about my cousin maisarah as well..I figured that would really turn me on!! Finally got him to say that she is pretty traditional on bed and it’s not exciting. I felt a rush of dopamine listening to him telling me how she is not nearly perfect on bed! Saw my opportunity and told him I would normally do anything my partner wants but now I’m single and miss pleasing men. He was in shock and as dumb as guys are he still was very respectful and didn’t get my message. But it was progress. That night Harris my cousin and I sat down for dinner. It was so hard to sit together. But I was at peace knowing my cousin ain’t good enough for her husband. 
The next day after kakak left to work I asked my brother in la if I should change jokingly !? He said as long you’re comfortable I don’t mind.
I wore a black shorts and a small white shirt with no bra. 
This time he asked is it uncomfortable to wear a bra ? confirming and affirming my small and perky boobs.
I said I’m just used to it since my ex likes it this way when we used to live together. He just smiled cause I’m sure my cousin told him about my ex and she always use to point out that I’m modern and my parents don’t know about my activities in the city. I felt an itch to make him bitch about cousin again (I know,I’m evil).
I told him I have small boobs and he’s lucky cause his wife’s boobs are big. He instantly breath out loud as though he was annoyed and said your kakak is useless in all this !!

I went on to defend my cousin so he would bitch more about her. He said they don’t have  much sex and he has to wait for the weekends even then she sometimes insist on visiting the parents house ruling out any opportunity for sex. I jumped in and played victim saying that I would have sex with my ex on command and even then he dump me (acting all sad) .
Harris said don’t be sad it’s his lost and went on to say “wish my wife was like you!”
I swear I had a mini orgasm knowing I was better than my cousin in a way. 
After work, it was about 6 ish but cousin comes back around 745-8pm 
We were in the hall sitting in the sofa when I told him u look tired as I remember he was complaining about work earlier. I took advantage of that. 
Told him to lay his head on my lap so I can give him a head massage. I’m still braless at this point!
After a little massage I felt his dick and it was hard. Before he could say anything I took off my top and told him to shut his mouth. I gently made him suck on my breast while I jerk him off. Right after he cum. I wiped it with my shirt and asked him if he’s okay while brushing his hair like a child. He replied yes. I then told him with a strict face kakak will be home soon and I need to clean up. He obliged and woke up. He remained silent the whole night after my cousin came back. I purposely acted super normal and teased him every bit I got…when my cousin was sitting on the sofa after dinner I went and laid my head on her lap the same way her husband was on me a few hours ago. While laying on my cousins lap I locked eyes with my brother in law and asked him if he’s going to the office tmrw ?he just looked at me like seeing a ghost and he was all sweaty!! The best part my sister was brushing my hair exactly the way I was !!!! 
These are the things that turns me on actually. 
No surpirse my brother In law Harris didn’t go to office that day and decided to work from home.
I went in the study room and asked him if he wants coffee or wanna chill on the sofa like yesterday instead ? 
He naturally came to the sofa. 
I made him sit there with the tv remote in his hands and starting giving him a bj…he tried to watch some tv but failed miserably. I took his cum all over my face that time and went on to kiss him with cum on my face. He was uncomfortable but I didn’t care 
We went on to have an affair that lasted for about 6 months till I had to shift out cause my work was far and I had return to office since things were going back to normal after the pandemic.

Okay, I know you didn’t write this letter to me, but I couldn’t help it. I just had to respond. Your words were like a warm cup of coffee on a chilly morning—so comforting, and they made me smile in that way you can’t quite explain. There’s something about the way you write that makes everything feel so... hopeful and genuine. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but I’m already finding myself curious about you, even though we haven’t met yet. 😊

You asked so many great questions, and honestly, I found myself thinking about them a lot. I think I’d be the type to have a cozy morning routine with a cup of coffee, watching the world slowly wake up. But, when the night falls, that’s when the magic happens. I love those deep, random conversations that last for hours—you know, the ones that make you feel like you’ve known someone forever even if it’s only been a few minutes. Do you enjoy those too? And I’m totally with you on the introvert thing, but when I’m around the right people, I can be the life of the party. Does that ever happen to you, Sevi? One minute, you’re quiet, and the next thing you know, you can’t stop chatting?

Okay, books. I live for them. Seriously, I think I would be a professional bookworm if I could. If we ever meet, expect me to drag you to the biggest library I can find, because what’s better than wandering through aisles of books with someone who gets it? I’d definitely want us to get lost in the pages together. And museums? Absolutely. I could spend hours in one. Imagine us just strolling through the halls, getting lost in all the stories and history. What about you, do you have a favorite museum? Or a favorite book? Because I’d love to know more!

Speaking of life updates— I just turned 25 in 2024! I’m honestly still trying to catch up with everything—between teaching, volunteering, ministry, and working on my Master’s, it feels like I’m juggling a lot right now. But you know what? I’m also not planning on slowing down anytime soon. In fact, I’m dreaming of going to law school and maybe even getting a PhD. So, I have to ask—are you prepared to wait around while I keep piling more things onto my plate? 😅 Because this melancholic-sanguine soul of mine likes to stay busy. And no pressure, but... do you think you’d be okay with that? I promise I’ll make it up to you with some cheesy coffee shop dates when I get a moment. 😉

Oh, and I’m so excited for you to become a tito! That’s such a huge milestone! I can just picture you with a little one in your arms, and I’m sure you’re going to be the most loving, fun, and amazing tito ever. Have you thought about what kind of “cool tito” you’ll be? I bet you’ll spoil them with all the best stories and maybe some extra ice cream, huh? I can already hear you telling them the wildest adventures!

You know, reading your letter made me realize something. I’ve never really thought much about love and relationships—mainly because I’ve been so focused on studies, family, and helping others. But... I don’t know. Maybe there’s a little part of me that’s starting to imagine a future that isn’t just filled with books and work. Maybe a future with someone who dreams big, laughs a lot, and shares moments like these with me. Someone like you. 😊

Now, about that bike thing—I am the one who never learned how to ride a bike! I know, it’s embarrassing! 😅 But seriously, I’m kind of excited (and a little nervous) for you to teach me. I have this picture in my head of us both wobbling around until we finally get the hang of it. Just promise you won’t laugh too hard when I fall over, okay? 😂 But hey, that’s what makes adventures fun, right?

I’m really glad I took the time to write this letter. It’s a little cheesy, I know, but it feels good to share some of these thoughts with you, even though we haven’t even met yet. If our paths cross in the future, I think it could be something truly special. And if not, well, I’ll still cheer you on from the sidelines, hoping you have all the happiness in the world.

Take care of yourself, Sevi. You’re a ball of sunshine, and I’m honestly wishing for all the best for you. Keep being awesome, and if I’m ever lucky enough to meet you, I can’t wait to see where our little adventure could go. Maybe even with a bike ride, a book, and a coffee in hand. 😊

Just a little background, I'm not an expert on coffee machines as this is my 2nd, my first was a Delonghi and me and my wife wanted to upgrade to an automatic machine.

My issue is that I just bought it yesterday and carefully read the manual and how to set it up, and each step was followed correctly.

Till the point of adding the coffee beans and giving it a try, during the grinding phase, which is the first, it stops and says 'Canceling.' 'Add Coffee Beans'.

I've gone through the internet for anyone having a similar issue, I find only good reviews on this machine and a couple of useless youtube videos. I've tried every basic troubleshooting, including trying different beans, gently shaking the beans in and nothing, no grinding happening.

Now I'm sure I've done the setup correctly but I'm furious that I paid all this money and not getting a working machine, I'm not sure if it's my fault or I'm unlucky I got a faulty one.

1hu7bhd,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1hu7bhd/review_trip_to_colombia_bogotá_medellín_and/,"Review trip to Colombia (Bogotá, Medellín and Cartagena)","Hello guys, I've just come back from a 10-day trip to Colombia with my girlfriend and as I asked for recommendations on what to do ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1g7hrxp/hostel\_recommendations\_in\_bogot%C3%A1\_medell%C3%ADn\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1g7hrxp/hostel_recommendations_in_bogot%C3%A1_medell%C3%ADn_and/) ), I will share my honest review on it. This review is going to be split in 4 parts: General Perceptions, Bogotá, Medellín, Cartagena.

**General Perceptions:**

Colombia is a beautiful and diverse country that is really worth visiting and not too expensive. People are very kind and foreign-friendly, even though I would recommend anyone willing to go to learn at least basic spanish because generally it is hard to handle things in english

Another remarkable thing is their food. Both traditional and foreign culinary are incredible and make Colombia a very interesting place for food lovers

Nevertheless, the country suffers with inequalities and has many problems that my own country (Brazil) also has. Tourist zones were awesome with many opportunities, but I didn't really feel safe outside them

**Bogotá:**

Bogotá is the country's capital and is not made for tourism so do not expect it to be.

I spent 4 days in the Cranky Croc Hostel in La Candelaria. The hostel is really 10/10 in all aspects (staff, infrastructure, food...), but I would rater stay in another neighborhood in the future (probably in Zona Rosa). During this time, I visit all the tourist spots in the city and my ""must go"" list is:

* Monserrate: A church is beautiful and the journey to get in there is incredible. I would really recommend for anyone to try it on foot (1h walk climbing the mountain), but the cable car is also worth it
* Museo Botero: The museum is awesome and extremely impressive in terms of number of paintings and escultures. In the top of everything, it is free
* Zona T: The coolest neighborhood in the city. Many restaurants, stores, parks... A guide is not necessary and exploring all streets is a good pick
* Jardín Botanico: There is not much to be said about it. It's a beautiful place with incredible facilities
* La Candelaria: The city tour is interesting and rich in terms of culture and history. Having a guide is a wise idea because otherwise you won't enjoy 100% of it

**Medellín:**

Medellín is super cool and its history makes it even more attractive.

I spent only 2 days in there and I regret not giving more time for it. I stood in a hostel called Airguest in El Poblado and recommend it to anyone traveling with partners. As I didn't have much time, I was only able to visit a few places that were recommended by the hostel but I would really recommend all of them as well. An interesting thing is that the city has a metro network, so its really easy to move from one place to the other within the city. The places I visited were:

* Tour in Guatapé: The tour is a 1 day trip outside of Medellín (leaving early in the morning and returning by 20pm). It goes through some cultural cities until it gets to Guatapé
* Pueblito Paisa: A historical spot within a mountain with remarkable food and a beautiful view... After the entrance I went on foot, but it was not easy due to the heat (it was like 1pm) - the good thing is that if you want there are many taxis available to take you up there
* Plaza Botero: Medellín is Botero's hometown and Plaza Botero is a interesting tribute for him with multiple huge structures from his carrier
* Comuna 13: Comuna 13 has a captivating vibe, people are friendly and the place is very very beautiful. I don't feel like I enjoyed it completely because I decided to do it without a guide, so I recommend you to book one

**Cartagena:**

Cartagena is a historical city with unique architecture. It is also next to the Caribbean sea, so you can see outstanding views outside the city

I spent 4 days there and although I loved it, I feel like it was too much for me. Many touristic spots can be visited on the same day so if you rush it (as I did) you can do the historical tour quickly. In terms of hostels, I was in Selina which was pretty nice due to the people in there

Another thing people warned me and I would like to warn you as well it that the city is safe within Getsemani, Boca Grande and Cidade Amurallada, but I didn't really feel the same outside it... For example, I went from the Cidade Amurallada to Castillo San Felipe (outside the touristic center) on foot (17pm) and didn't feel safe during the path so I took an Uber on my way back and he told me that it was not a good place to walk

Regardless of that, I had a really good time in Cartagena and the best places I've been were:

* Islas del Rosario: Islas del Rosario is probably the most popular tour in Cartagena and once you are there it is really easy to understand why. I went after a rainy day and the guide told us that the water wouldn't be so clear due to it, so I recommend going after a sunny day. Another thing is that there are two options for this tour: with or without the planktons tour. If you are not short of money, I would recommend taking the plankton tour to have a new experience
* Cidade Amurallada: The touristic center in Cartagena. I went there without a guide, but just like Comuna 13 in Medellin I recommend you to book one. Of course you can walk within the walls and see beautiful architecture, but you will not enjoy it 100% if you don't understand all the history of the place
* Café San Alberto: It is a coffee shop inside Cidade Amurallada. I personally loved the coffee and the experience. They also have a store in it where my girlfriend bought a coffee lip balm that she loves... So if you are a lip balm lover, it might be a good option
* Castillo San Felipe: The Castle is beautiful and offers a great view of the city and the sea. It's a very interesting well-preserved piece of Colombian past. My recommendation is to watch the sunset from there, it's really worth it. The only downside is that the entrance fee is a bit expensive
* Calles de Getsemani: The streets are beautiful and worth it if you enjoy the night life and new people. Personally I just walked there, didn't stop for any drinks, but really loved the vibe. It gets really crowded and full of life, music and dancing",1,1736084578.0,backpacking,0,1.0,False

1hu77g2,https://i.redd.it/b9u0fgfnh6be1.jpeg,Review #2 Bottle Kill: Jack Daniel’s SBBP Rye,"136.6 proof

Warehouse 1-07

Bottled on 1-9-24

NOSE:
This one will singe your nose hairs right off if you aren’t careful. There’s definitely a lot of ethanol on the nose, but underneath you get the stereotypical bourbon notes of vanilla and caramel, along with some more baked goods like cinnamon rolls or coffee cake with the crumbled topping on top. 


PALATE:
It’s so viscous it almost tastes like syrup with the flavors to match. But man is it HOT! Definitely drinks every bit of its 136.6 proof. I actually prefer this one over a small ice cube, enough to dilute the whiskey down to the 110 to low 120 proof range. Otherwise I don’t get much in terms of flavor, just heat. 
Over ice, you get nice syrupy flavors that surprisingly remind me a little of what a barrel proof Woodford DO would taste like. There’s some cocoa, and a bit grassiness and mint from the rye spice, but mostly it leans more toward traditional bourbon rather than rye flavors. 

FINISH:
Looong and lingering. Big warm Kentucky hug. Definitely some good oakiness on the finish. It’s a solid pour, one that warms you up and fills your bones with fire. 

FINAL THOUGHTS:
I loved this bottle but wish the heat were more tame. I can drink low 130 proof ECBP neat without blinking, but for whatever reason my bottle of the JDSBBPR was incredibly hot to my palate. Still, over an ice cube, it’s a solid pour and definitely one I would consider rebuying if I saw it on the shelf for a decent price. 

RATING:
7.8 on the t8ke scale. It’s a great pour. ",11,1736084199.0,bourbon,0,1.0,False

My mouth and lips are sooooo dry!!!

The only difference is I’m eating a lot healthier, cutting out almost all ultra processed foods and added sugars, but eating enough calories and a range of food types. I also have this thing where I need to clear my throat a lot. If this happens, I drink a drink of water and within a couple of hours it’s resolved.

I have 45k saved, and a deposit gift from my family of 50k. I have looked at buying my own place but I'm waiting for my boyfriend to finish paying a few things and helping family, so we are looking to move in around 1.5 years. 

I live with my parents and luckily have no monthly expenses to pay them but I do buy the groceries for us 3. I want to buy myself (or lease) a bigger car until I move out. Without too much detail I live in a very remote part of the Peak District with extreme weather and currently drive a small electric car. In the past month, there's been 4 occasions I've been unable to drive for a few days even though 4wd suv's are safe on our roads.  Please let me know if paying for a car is sensible? 

  
Monthly take home: £2,100

Side hustles (before you come at me yes, I do fill out my self assessment and paying tax) - £500

Groceries + food for us three (incl. dinner out maybe once or twice a month) : £300-400

Gym: £60 (not willing to budge, I love my gym) 

Spotify £10

Monthly physio (necessary) - £80 

so left over with around £2,050 a month. My bf and I don't usually do much that costs money, i.e. always hiking, usually just get coffees, etc. so I don't live an expensive lifestyle. Obviously the odd payment happens here or there, I don't go shopping for clothes often etc so I am confident in saving usually 1,750 at least a month. I haven't gone on holiday in almost 3 years and really cannot explain how good with my money that I am. 

  
Basically I'm trying to ask if spending a couple hundred pounds a month of paying for a bigger car would be reasonable considering I've got good savings, I'm sensible with my money and have a good deposit saved so when my bf is also financially ready it would be okay. My parents have said that they wouldn't do this, and are making me feel guilty for spending money but not sure then when am I ever going to spend money???

We are accepting new players to join the Closed Beta! ,"Hello there r/games !

I've posted here on Indie Sunday before, and we are once again inviting more players to our closed beta until January 7th, so I decided to write an update post!

If you feel like you'd like to try it, you get instant to access by supporting the game through [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/WalkScape) or [Buy me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/walkscape) until January 7th. The game is completely community funded.

I have struggled to exercise enough, and I also have ADHD. Gamifying exercise works really well for my dopamine-craving brain, but I'm also easily distracted, so the current mobile fitness games on the market didn't really work for me. That's how I came up with this idea.

Here are some info about the game and how it's different from Pokemon Go for example:

- no distractions. I love games that value my time. WalkScape is designed so that it encourages you not to open it while you're walking, but afterwards. And even if you open it while walking, changing things in the game is super quick.
- no GPS. So you can walk where ever you want. The game tracks your steps even without an internet connection, but you need a connection when you open the game.
- no ads, no MTX. I hate predatory monetisation practises, and they encourage unhealthy spending habits. This game is about both mental and physical health.

In the game, you explore and work in different skills such as woodcutting, foraging, fishing and crafting by walking in real life. The game uses your phone's pedometer to track your progress. It's also online, so you can work with your friends towards common goals without needing to be physically in the same location.

The game has dozens of locations, hundreds of items, NPCs, shops and more is coming as I work towards the full release of the game. There's a lot of different unique and cute activities in the game you can set your character to do in addition to the typical woodcutting and mining, like volunteering in soup kitchen or helping locals repairing their boats. All fueled by walking IRL.

You can also check our this video to hear me and the artist explain more about the game: [Youtube introduction video](https://youtu.be/RjaQeb5Rapg?si=AUeqlLpEdBGDOC-y)

Or you can [visit the website](https://walkscape.app).

We also have my devblogs released every two weeks available at r/WalkScape

It's been a wild journey for me growing this thing from my personal hobby project, and awesome to see the game helping so many people to exercise more. I'll answer any questions you might have in the comments!

Stay hydrated, and keep walking ❤️

Reflect

Elevate

Approach

Level Up


1. Reflect: Understand tumhe kya chaiye pehle, aur tum kya ho pehle? 

Before you even think about dating, ask yourself: What am I bringing to the table?

Self-Awareness:

Meri strengths kya hai? Charisma? Humor? Intelligence?

Meri weaknesses kya haj? Social anxiety? Lack of grooming? Poor fitness?



Action Steps:

Write down three things you like about yourself and three things tum khud mein improve karna chahte hai.

Accept that confidence comes from embracing tum kya ho—flaws and all.


Example:

If you’re shy, don’t try to act like a loud extrovert. Instead, apni strengths pe khelo par also weakness pe kaam karte huye—be mysterious, observant, and a great listener.

Ek aur baat If you don’t know what type of person you’re looking for, you’ll end up chasing random people jo tumhari vibe kabhi match karenge bhai. It’s like grocery shopping without a list—you’ll grab a bunch of stuff jiski zaroorat bhi nahi tumhe.

Having a clear idea of what you’re looking for means:

You waste less time on incompatible matches.

You can build a connection based on mutual values and interests.

Girlfriend se wife tak le jaoge agar ye jaante Hoge.


2. Elevate: Improve Key Areas

Now that you’ve reflected, it’s time to become a version of yourself that people can’t help but notice.

The Four Pillars of Attraction:

1. Appearance:

Get a basic skincare routine (cleanser, moisturizer).

Apni body type ke hisaab se dress well karo. Neutral colors, fitted clothes—no baggy hoodies unless you’re lounging.



2. Fitness:

Hit the gym or start bodyweight exercises. Being fit isn’t just about looking good; it’s about feeling good aur fir tum wo energy radiate karoge.

Cardio + strength training = a killer combo.



3. Social Skills:

Learn how to make small talk (start with casual topics like school, hobbies, or trending shows).

Practice active listening: Nod, make eye contact, and respond thoughtfully.



4. Mindset:

Stop thinking “How can I get her to like me?” Instead, think, “Do I even like her?”

Focus on abundance: duniya mein boht amazing people hai bas tum open raho unse milne ke liye.


Example:

Imagine you meet someone at a school event. If you’ve taken care of your appearance, fitness, and social skills, you’ll naturally stand out without trying too hard.


3. Approach: Master the Art of Interaction

You’ve reflected and elevated—ab khud ko maidan mein rakhna hai.

The 3-Second Rule:

If you see someone you want to talk to, approach them within three seconds. Overthinking = hesitation = missed opportunity.

Steps to a Great Approach:

1. Start Simple:

“Hey, I noticed you’re into [shared interest]. You Mind agar mein join karun toh ?”

“I couldn’t help but mene suba—are you talking about [relevant topic]?”



2. Flirt Playfully:

Tease her lightly about something (e.g., “You’re really into coffee, huh? Thats why people cant sleep on you.”). Lame hai par example ke taur pe samjho

Compliment her uniquely (“That jacket’s got some personality, mujhe pasand aayi).



3. Gauge Interest:

Does she maintain eye contact? Smile? Ask questions back? These are signs she’s interested.


Example:

You see her in the library, reading a fantasy novel. Approach with: “That book must be good— tum kabse padh rahe ho. Is it worth reading?”


4. Level Up: Play the Long Game

Attraction is not a one-and-done deal. Keep improving, learning, and building meaningful connections.

Key Practices:

1. Stay Consistent:

Keep working on your appearance, skills, and mindset.

Confidence grows over time, naaki ek raat mein.


2. Handle Rejection Gracefully:

Rejection doesn’t define you. Treat it as a stepping stone. Rejection is like ram naam ka patthar.

Example: “No problem, thanks for being honest. Take care!”



3. Build a Network:

Expand your social circle through clubs, events, or hobbies.

The more people you meet, the better your chances of finding someone compatible.


4. Balance Availability:

Jaldbaazi ni karni; have your own life.

People value those who value themselves.


Putting It All Together: A Scenario

Imagine this:

You’ve been hitting the gym, and tumhara confidence 7ve aasam mein. You’ve started dressing sharp and have a new hobby—photography.

At a school , you see a girl who shares your interest. You walk up and say:
“Hey, I noticed you’re into photography too. What’s your favorite subject to shoot?”

She engages, you tease her a bit about her camera choice, and she laughs. By the end, you exchange contacts naturally.


Why This Framework Works:

1. It starts with you, not some fake tricks or lines.


2. It’s about building long-term habits jo tumhe attractive banayenge.


3. It’s adaptable—you can tweak it for different situations.



The REAL Framework isn’t just about getting a girlfriend. It’s about leveling up so you naturally attract the right people into your life. Become the person others want to be around, and everything else will follow.

What is your experience and your opinions on using store-bought coffee beans? I was a professional barista in an elite coffee shop in my city and with my first salary I bought a 350$ espresso machine with a built in grinder because I used to grind with a blade grinder and it was inconsistent and pure eyeballing. For the past year I really wanted to try out freshly roasted beans but there are no roasters in my area, I have to drive at least 100km to get to a small roaster. I have never drank espresso and said: ""wow this is good and I can feel subtle notes and aromas and whatever"" to every cafe I go, I order a cappuccino and an espresso, just so I can try and see if there is any taste or aroma in that espresso. In the morning I make myself a cappuccino or a latte so coffee taste doesn't really matter to me. The extraction is always lacking, either not enough extraction time, no crema at all and no subtle flavours , just plain coffee flavour (which for me feels bitter).
Please tell me if you've ever had any success with store-bought beans. Thanks!

Hey guys,

I’m looking to buy a coffee maker. Every morning, I end up spending money on coffee before work, and sometimes the drive-thru wait is just too long.

Can you recommend something within $100 CAD that’s quick, easy to use, and makes good coffee? I drink dark roast every morning, so it needs to be good for that.

I’ll be in Seville 7th - 12th Jan, then Málaga 12th - 20th Jan to train ahead of the road race season. I ride out here a lot during the off season. 

Will be doing a mixture of hard interval days and easier endurance days. Also playing pádel in the evenings to wind down!

I enjoy sports, specialty coffee, good food, tech, photography, travel, and music. I’ve been learning Spanish, so I’m always keen to practice too. 

Always love meeting new people, it’d be great to find others to ride with. Groups to join or just individuals. 

Drop me a DM if you’re keen! Happy to connect on Instagram or Strava :) 😄

Sono un ragazzo che segue Jematria già da un anno, forse più. Come suggerimento per nuovo content, vorrei consigliare a Jematria di portare un video sugli scandali nei videogiochi o riguardanti comunque il mondo videoludico. Jem ha già trattato Moon Man, e altre versioni un po' controverse di Doom, oltre a giochi indie dal significato oscuro. Sarebbe bello espandersi anche ai videogiochi più comuni, e parlare degli scandali e controversie che li riguardano. Mi vengono in mente personalmente Hot Coffee di GTA San Andreas, o la censura nella versione UK di Mario Party 8. Poi magari Jem ne trova altre. Potrebbe approfittarne infine per aggiungere anche qualche stranezza, o cose che ti fanno dire tipo ""eh !?"", come ad esempio il clone tarocco di Pokémon Nero fatto dalla PETA, già che Jem parlò di Clover, la ROM di 4chan.

PS : onestamente non sapevo se flaggare questo post come sottobosco o come infanzia rovinata, per via che alcune controversie nei videogiochi riguardano giochi anche per bambini, come appunto il già citato MP8. Io lo flaggo come sottobosco, se volete però lo cambio.

When asked about his plan to tackle this he told us ‘it’s not good when sick people cannot access the care they need, something needs to be done’. A government spokesperson told us that Streeting has called emergency meetings with NHS Leaders this week. A review commissioned by the NHS for £1M has detailed an ongoing issue with poor staffing and inappropriate use of secondary care services due to a difficult in accessing primary care. 

‘One idea we’re playing around with is getting Costa’s Baristas trained in diagnostics and triaging to support A&E Minors & paediatrics. Can you imagine getting a cup of coffee and a discharge letter at the same time?!’ Costa said they are happy to help train staff to provide clinical activities, so long as they are provided an NHS contract to do so. 

Another source of demand identified came from re-attendance of patients on year long waiting lists for elective procedures. ‘This one’s brilliant, the guys at Buckinghamshire Medical School told me that surgery is basically like cooking from a recipe where you’re repeating the same steps. My advisor tells me that Barbers used to perform procedures such as Amputations - why did we let them deskill. Under conservative leadership you’ve seen your barbers limited to hair only, but not anymore! We will be bringing surgery back to communities and providing the right training at local colleges to make this happen.’  

On primary care, the health secretary said ‘in fact most of the things you see your GP, or other medically qualified professional for, doesn’t require a GP appointment. If you’ve got a mental health problem from chronic conditions, for example arthritis, we can actually train someone like a beautician to give you steroid injections under ultrasound and also have a good chat with you. I mean they’re already injecting Botox and the like into people, what’s the difference?’ 

When asked how he’d ensure safety for patients he told us ‘look people care more about being seen than who they see. Anyone seeing a patient who is unsure can simply refer them to their supervising consultant or A&E’. When asked if he would use these new services, he said ‘Well of course I have used the NHS my whole life like everyone else. I like coffee and haircuts too’. 

These plans are expected to cost the NHS an extra £1.4Bn per year. On funding we believe there will be cuts to services that are freed up with these initiatives and even closing down underused community health centres and district general hospitals. ",20,1736082172.0,doctorsUK,2,0.92,False

Monkey throw 💩 at you, and it's warm and moist because I just pooped it out. 

Humans, you drink poison. Bottled water has 200,000 plastic pieces in one bottle. Tap water, less than 10. 

Use reusable bottles, or I make wet fart in your mouth when you sleep. I have special skills, so I can make it happen.

You ruin monkey jungle and pour garbage in oceans where monkeys used to like surfing, back in 80's. 

Now, let me explain something: I just stopped time with my monkey time powers and pooped on all your houses. Your moms are loose women who smell like poop, so you probably didn’t notice, but it's there on your roof still, probably. 

You’ve got poop on your houses right now, and it’s your fault! I fart in your fridge too, so your food smell off hahahaha! *monkey sounds*

*Throws more poop at you for feeding evil bottled water corporations* 💩 💩

P.S. I'll make wet farts in your Starbucks coffee while you're in drive thru, with my monkey time stop powers, too. All your food will taste like nasty shit because I can use powers like Naruto has and make lots of poopin monkey clones of myself and shit like that.

Introduction

In 2024, Italian families are feeling the pinch as the prices of breakfast staples like butter, coffee, and cocoa soar. According to Assoutenti, the price increases are close to 49 percent, with overall expenditure on coffee alone exceeding 7 billion euros. This surge in costs is not just a financial burden but also a cultural and social challenge for Italy.



Key Facts

Butter Prices: Up by 49% in 2024



Coffee Expenditure: Over 7 billion euros in 2024



Cocoa Prices: Also experiencing significant increases



Cultural Impact

Breakfast in Italy is more than just a meal; it's a cherished tradition. The rising costs are forcing families to rethink their morning routines and traditions. The Italian love for a rich breakfast with freshly brewed coffee and buttered pastries is being tested as they seek more affordable alternatives.



Environmental Perspective

The price hikes are partly due to global supply chain disruptions and climate change affecting agricultural production. Italian consumers are becoming more aware of the environmental impact of their food choices and are exploring sustainable options.



Social Impact

The increased costs are hitting low-income families the hardest. Many are struggling to afford basic breakfast items, leading to nutritional concerns and social inequality. Community initiatives and food banks are stepping in to help those in need.



Ethical Perspectives from the Catholic Community

The Catholic community in Italy is advocating for social justice and solidarity. They emphasize the importance of supporting local farmers and choosing ethically sourced products. The Church is also involved in charitable activities to assist families affected by the rising costs.



Actionable Advice

Support Local Farmers: Buy locally produced butter and cocoa to reduce costs and support the local economy.



Explore Alternatives: Consider healthier and more affordable breakfast options like oatmeal or homemade granola.



Community Support: Engage with local food banks and charities to help those in need.



Interactive Elements

Poll: How has the rising cost of breakfast items affected your daily routine?



FAQs: What are some affordable alternatives to traditional breakfast items?



Fact-Checking: Verify the sources of your breakfast products to ensure they are ethically produced.



Conclusion

The rising costs of breakfast staples are a significant challenge for Italian society, impacting cultural traditions, environmental awareness, and social equality. By supporting local farmers, exploring alternatives, and engaging in community support, Italian families can navigate these challenges together.

This is a brief report of our recent trip to Iceland - feel free to ask any questions. 

Day one: Arrived Keflavík around 2pm on Monday afternoon (delayed). Booked a 4WD with Lotus. They met us at the airport and transferred us to their office (under 5 minutes drive) where we collected our car. We did online check-in with platinum insurance so our keys were ready for us in a coded lockbox. Car had GPS and in car wi-fi. It was snowing heavily, near white-out conditions, very difficult. We drove very slowly from Keflavik to Black Beach Suites outside Vik. The GPS said three hours but it took us around five because of the weather and stopping for food in Selfoss. 

Day two: We left at 7am and drove to Jokulsarlon lagoon to meet our guide for an ice cave tour. It was dry and bright but very cold and icy so we took it slow and arrived just before 11am. No wind thankfully. We booked a private half day ice cave tour with Stepman who was excellent - highly recommend. Afterwards we explored the lagoon and diamond beach. Grabbed coffee and doughnuts from the cafe and headed back to Vik where we caught the 7pm lava show which was brilliant - kids loved it. 

Day three: We packed up and checked out of the suites at 10am. Spent some time at Reynisfjara at sunrise - stunningly beautiful - dry, bright, cold, gorgeous. Could have spent hours here but left just as it was getting busy with tourists. Took a slow drive up to our Airbnb cabin in Fludir via Skógafoss (rammed with tourists, couldn't get near it, underfoot conditions were tricky) and Seljialandsfoss (nobody there and it was lovely in comparison, equally beautiful). Saw the aurora from our hot tub in the evening. 

Day four: We visited the secret lagoon late morning. Wore our swimsuits under our clothes, took them down to our ankles and washed nude under the showers which made it easier to pull our swimsuits back up. It was foggy with very light snow. Thoroughly enjoyed it, wasn't too busy. We ate lunch at Fridheimar on the way home - a cool place, food was great, especially so if you love tomatoes as much as I do. 

Day five: Drove to Reykjavik, clear and bright day, no snow or ice on the ground at all in Reykjavik. The drive took about 90 minutes. We did a family viking portrait session at Mink which was so much fun and the photos were great. Pastries from Braud & Co lived up the hype. Explored downtown and looked for cats. Went to the cat café. A good day - wish we had more time for Perlan and Harpa. Unfortunately I think we probably got a speeding ticket on our way home driving through Pingvellir - waiting for Lotus to contact us about that (was going around 60km, roads were icy, didn't realise the whole park was a 50km limit). 

Day six: Gulfoss and Geysir. Both fab and worth a visit. We had lunch at the Gulfoss visitor centre which was very good and stocked up on souvenirs. It was extremely cold and icy underfoot, no wind or fresh snow though, we saw multiple people falling over. Quite treacherous and crowds were busy. Saw the aurora from our hot tub again on our final night. 

Day seven: Left our cabin at 6am and drove to Keflavik to return the car. It was snowing heavily. The drive took about two hours. Returning the car to Lotus was easy. No issues with our flight home. 

We had a really incredible trip and sad that it's over. Loved every minute and already planning a return visit in summer.

I left London 7 years ago to move north but during the 12 years I spent in London, my mum and I never went to the theatre together! It's been a running joke so next weekend we're heading to our fair capital for two days/one night and a night at a show for her 70th birthday! 

The city has changed so much and I'm usually in and out seeing pals in usual haunts when I'm there now. 
Here's my current plan, I'd love some recommendations to make the most of our time there, food places, bars, activities that fit into our location etc. 

-Arrive midday at KX, check into hotel based at KX
-Room won't be ready so we'll probably head back there to get ready briefly later if they can't get us in a room early - this is a bit of a faff though 
-free afternoon (around room check in time) - thought about Churchill War Rooms as she's a total war history but and hasn't been 
-I'd like to do an early pre show dinner (she's keen for Chinatown which is well located for theatre) 
-theatre time! 
-drinks with a view afterwards (rooftop/view over London)

Next day 
-get up, breakfast somewhere (haven't booked with hotel so London is our oyster - see what I did there?) 
-a museum? Seems keen for V+A or Natural History 
-a magnificent nice stroll around from somewhere to somewhere else - I keep reading about coffee/lunch on Marchmont Street, what's that about? 
-back to hotel for stuff, train at 4pm

For lunch and things previously she's loved Borough Market and we don't need sit down fancy places apart from dinner, she loves quirky stuff, and history. Because of our time limitations going out of Central isn't a great use of our time. Gonna be keeping an eye on the London Pop ups site this week!

What worked last year may already be outdated. If you want to stay ahead in 2025, here are the trends your business can’t afford to ignore.

🔍 **1. AI-Powered Search Will Dominate**  
Search engines are getting smarter, thanks to AI. Tools like Google Bard and Bing AI are shaping how people find information. Optimizing for conversational queries and natural language will be key. Think: “What’s the best coffee shop near me?” instead of “coffee shop NYC.”

💡 **Action Step**: Create content that answers specific, conversational questions.

📱 **2. Mobile Experience Is Non-Negotiable**  
Google’s mobile-first indexing is no longer a trend; it’s the standard. Slow-loading, non-responsive sites won’t just lose rankings—they’ll lose customers.

💡 **Action Step**: Audit your website for mobile responsiveness and speed regularly.

🎙️ **3. Voice Search Is Growing**  
“Hey Google” is becoming the new norm. By 2025, more than 50% of searches are predicted to be voice-based.

💡 **Action Step**: Optimize for long-tail, conversational keywords and local phrases like “near me.”

🌎 **4. Local SEO Is Bigger Than Ever**  
Hyperlocal searches are skyrocketing. People want answers in real-time, near their location.

💡 **Action Step**: Focus on Google Business Profile, local keywords, and reviews to capture nearby customers.

🧠 **5. Experience-Driven SEO Takes the Lead**  
SEO isn’t just about ranking—it’s about delivering value. Google’s algorithms prioritize user intent and content relevance over keyword stuffing.

💡 **Action Step**: Invest in high-quality, engaging, and helpful content that solves your audience’s problems.

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea and coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to be a problem, then I am not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the writing is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me as a collaborative writer is that I come pretty much empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything from scratch together with my partner! I really do mean everything, be it the setting, the lore, the characters, the magic system, all of it! The main exception are mainly monsters and other fantastical creatures that I may, or may not outright ~~(and not at all shamelessly)~~ steal from DnD, video games, other media and folklore! This also means that if you happen to already have a constructed world with detailed lore, I will not be very interested. It is not a perfect approach, but well, I do not believe in perfect, and it is what works for me!

This also does mean that, in the best case scenario, it may take us up to a week before we can actually start, and that *is* **the** optimistic estimate.

A very important thing is where lies my main source of inspiration, and that's the j-RPG genre of video games. On one hand, it does mean that I want to use the tropes and storytelling conventions common in those, so long they don't translate too poorly to text. What *is* the more important thing though is the story structure that I prefer for my roleplays, which is akin to that of a DnD session! Specifically that rather than *just* the two co-protagonists I want to control a whole travelling party with my writing partner, that will come from town to town, brave different dungeons, face many vile antagonists, while the overarching threat looms over the horizon! I love action, I love tension, and what do I even love more?! Steaks! Stakes! I mean stakes! Not *necessarily*, but very possibly up to the world-ending variety!

Anyway...

What is the exact plot, and what are going to be the dominant themes are something that I want to decide on together! Now, what do I have a hard preference on is the setting, which I want to be an **URBAN FANTASY!** What I mean by urban fantasy is a world where magic is hardly a secret hidden from the world of the 'muggles' and is common knowledge, often being combined and intertwined with the more mundane sorts of technology! While medieval fantasy is NOT my preference, I still tend to utilize a great deal of medieval fantasy tropes. I just love to put a more modern spin on them! Such as, a monster-slaying guild that operates as either a modern-day corporation or a government service, such as the fire department, with all the good and bad that both imply! Now, how advanced is the setting supposed to be, THAT is something I am not set on. At the moment, I feel I have a preference for something akin to Final Fantasy VII or VIII developmentally-wise, though I'm not terribly sure. However, as long as our prospective world has at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I may want to stress that at least at the moment of writing this very post, I am not interested in a pre-industrial fantasy story. I've already got one, and I don't exactly hunger for more!

I have mentioned action, and I believe it may be a wise to write a paragraph on it, as well. Putting it this way: while my characters would be little more than cannon fodder in particularly overpowered universes such as Dragon Ball or the Invincible, they would still be considered OP by the standards of more grounded, realistic settings. By which I mean things such as swordsmen cutting through scores of armed modern soldiers, the dodging and parrying of bullets with bladed weapons, or allegedly human characters that can somehow wrestle with bears or wield swords that should quite literally break their backs. In other words, a good degree of willing suspension of disbelief is pretty much required! So, do let me know if all that sounds up your alley!

I also absolutely love to have ensemble casts in stories! Which means that the ability to write characters that vary by gender, age\*, social background, moral alignment, personality, and more, is pretty much a requirement! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! Another reason it is so important is that I love to explore a wealth of different character dynamics within a story, and for that, you need diversity!

\*That said, the vast majority of the cast should be 21+, if not 25+

As for the lead character, I'll see what I come up with once we actually get to planning! The only thing I know for certain is that at the moment of writing this advert, I prefer that neither of our lead characters come from a military or police background. Well, that and that they both ought to be women, but that should go without saying given the tags I used... right? I should also mention that typically, I prefer to write characters in their early-to-mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't 100% off the table, I cannot promise that you'll be able to actually convince me to go down that road.

While I do not outright require that our lead characters have to become romantically involved, I am probably not the person for you, if you dislike or avoid writing romance in general.

I also may want to say a couple more words about romance. While I have a hard preference for the main pairing, that being FxF, I do prefer writing partners that can write all three main gender combinations. Why? That's simple! I like variety, and I just do not find it very realistic, or immersive if it's only ever one of these present in the story! I also just generally consider it a major green flag in a writing partner!

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! I typically tend to take my time rather than answer the very first person that messages me. What I do want to know is how I may call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete, so don't worry, I am not asking for much! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I will prefer to stay here, before actually moving there. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Should I mention this to my dentist beforehand?,"I had a bad habit of brushing too hard for a few months out of stress and ended up making divots and wear on the top of both my lateral incisor. Since then I've been careful to brush softy and only in circles. There's no pain, but I don't like how it looks and feel like it'll be easier to continue to damage my teeth if they aren't smoothed out, so I'm getting composite fillings in a couple weeks.

I don't smoke nor chew tobacco, but I am 23 and for 4 years I was an avid coffee drinker, sometimes drinking 2 or 3 cups a day. I also really liked vanilla cokes. Now, I've given up drinking coffee and cokes, but my teeth have already been stained a bit, especially the sides of my canines. While I don't have the money for it now, I do later on, hopefully this year, want to get teeth whitening professionally done, so should I mention this to my dentist so he can factor that in for the color choice? Or is the staining minor enough that it shouldn't matter too much? I know the smart thing to do would be to get them whitened first, but I'm worried that the bristles will catch in the divots, and I'll accidentally cause more damage in the meanwhile.

I'm afraid of at home whitening treatments, but if that is a good idea to do ahead of time, I could do that.

Also I worry that my teeth are less stained and discolored than I've thinned away the enamel with my heavy handedness, especially since my teeth have always been on the transparent side of things and the sides of my back teeth don't look stained. So is there a way to tell by looking which is the case, or is that something I should ask my dentist or in a consultation for tooth whitening?

Sorry that this was rambling and a bit all over the place. I get very nervous and worrisome about health issues and tend for obsession. I'd be very appreciative of any advice.

However, 3 minutes after that two of the woman’s friends showed up, so now I was sat at a table by myself with a group of three friends. 

I was doing work on my laptop, so while having the one lady join was fine, having a group of people chatting was distracting, and I thought the first woman could have stated that she really meant if it was okay if her and her friends could join. 

Pretty soon after the friends arrived I got up and said that I would find another table, and one of the women said ‘I guess you would find our conversation boring’ which seemed passive aggressive.

Am I overreacting in thinking this was rude and is this etiquette okay in the U.K.?

Edit: a few comments about availability of tables in the cafe. I would always get a two-seater in this cafe but they were full when I arrived.

Eating: smoked salmon + eggs, ribeyes, beef sausages and liver once a week > all cooked in butter. (Only thing i drink is black coffee, water and espressos when I'm doing work).

Yesterday I suddenly experienced some serious lower abdominal pain (sharp pains that come and go). And it feels like my colon is inflamed/puffed up. Feces comes out thin.

It also feels like when I'm sitting on the toilet some poop is \*coming\* out but nothing is actually coming out despite pushing quite hard... (sorry for too much TMI, im a little desperate for some help so I'm specifying details).

Anyone experienced THIS issue or along the lines? Is it because I'm not eating enough animal fat or fat in general?",3,1736080521.0,carnivorediet,1,1.0,False

I’ll be in Seville 7th - 12th January to train ahead of the road race season. I ride out here a lot during the off season. 

Will be doing a mixture of hard interval days and easier endurance days. Also playing pádel in the evenings to wind down!

I enjoy sports, specialty coffee, good food, tech, photography, travel, and music. I’ve been learning Spanish, so I’m always keen to practice too. 

Always love meeting new people, it’d be great to find others to ride with. Groups to join or just individuals. 

Drop me a DM if you’re keen! Happy to connect on Instagram or Strava :) 😄

I recently got more into the hobby of espresso and I've been looking to get a grinder for my home setup which consists of a delonghi dedicated pump espresso machine so far. I saw this offer on marketplace from a guy that closed his coffee shop and is selling out different pieces of equipment, so I'm guessing it has been used a fair amount. Judging from the photos does it look like it's in good condition? What are the main things I'll have to look out for in person? I'm fairly new so I don't really know what kind of questions to ask. Also the price he is selling it for is 50€. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Hi everyone,

I am a male in my 30s, and I am from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, Britain (England). I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂
