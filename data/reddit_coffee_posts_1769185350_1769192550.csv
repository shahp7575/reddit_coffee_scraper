(and beyond!) - My wild coding journey","Hey Reddit, I wanted to share my coding origin story, because honestly, a few years ago, the idea of writing a single line of code felt like trying to decipher ancient hieroglyphs. I was stuck in a dead-end job, feeling pretty restless and uninspired, just scrolling through life with no real direction. The world of tech seemed like this exclusive club for super-geniuses, and I definitely wasn't one of them.

Then one day, a friend showed me a simple Python script they'd written to automate a boring task, and something just clicked. It wasn't the code itself that blew me away, but the sheer *power* it offered – the ability to build and create, to make computers *do things*. I remember feeling this weird mix of intimidation and intense curiosity bubbling up. So, I bit the bullet and signed up for a free online course, heart pounding with a mix of dread and excitement.

Oh man, those first few weeks were BRUTAL. Variables, loops, functions... it all felt like a jumbled mess in my brain. There were so many moments I just wanted to slam my laptop shut and declare myself officially 'not a tech person.' I spent hours staring blankly at error messages, feeling a fiery flush of frustration creep up my neck. I distinctly recall one particularly awful debugging session where I swore I could *smell* my brain melting. But then, *poof*! A tiny 'Hello, World!' appeared on my screen, and it felt like I'd just discovered fire. That little win, that tiny spark, kept me going.

From there, it became an obsession. Late nights fuelled by questionable coffee, surrounded by half-eaten snacks, meticulously building small projects, breaking them, and then painstakingly fixing them. Every successful line of code, every bug squashed, felt like a miniature triumph. The frustration never really went away, but it was replaced by a deeper sense of accomplishment and a quiet confidence that grew with each new concept I grasped.

Fast forward to today, and I'm actually working as a junior developer. It still feels surreal sometimes, like I've tricked my way into this cool club. The journey was wild, full of doubt and despair, but also incredible highs when a complex piece of logic finally clicked into place. It's a testament to just showing up, day after day, even when it feels impossible.

So, what's your coding origin story? Did you jump right in, or was it a slow, painful climb like mine? What was that one moment that made you think, 'Hey, maybe I *can* do this?'",1,1769192371.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

I'm quite new to the hobby and need help regarding grinders – thanks a lot in advance! 

I currently own a DF54, which I mainly use for espresso. Recently, I started to get into filter coffee (V60) and also bought an Aeropress, which I quite enjoy. The DF54 does a reasonably fine job, but I am thinking of an additional (manual) grinder for two reasons:

1) I'd like to up my coffee game while travelling. In the warmer months I do motorcycle trips sometimes and would like to bring an Aeropress in the future, so portability is a factor. But mainly:

2) I'd like to do the beans I buy and brew at home justice and have a grinder at hand that works better for pourovers then my DF54.

So far, I looked at the 1zpresso Q Air, the Kingrinder K6 and the 1zpresso K-Ultra (and maybe the ZP6, but I'm unsure if I fancy that much clarity over body, tbh). All would work well for me for different reasons, I guess, so I'd be very interested to hear from you what you would recommend. Thank you! :)",1,1769192343.0,pourover,0,1.0,False
1qkyg84,https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/1qkyg84/i_built_a_receipt_scanner_that_autosplits_line/,I built a receipt scanner that auto-splits line items into YNAB categories,"Hey r/YNAB,

I've been using YNAB for years, and there's one thing that always bugged me: I can see I spent $800 on groceries last month, but I have no idea how much of that was actual food vs. cleaning supplies vs. the snacks my kid swears he'll eat (he won't).

I wanted to track spending trends at the item level — like, am I actually spending $50/month on coffee creamer? (Spoiler: yes.)

I looked for an app that could scan receipts, pull out the line items, and split them into YNAB categories. But everything I found either didn't sync to YNAB, didn't do splits, or wanted to upload my receipts to their servers. No thanks.

So I built my own. Took way longer than I expected (thanks, OCR edge cases), but it works. I've been using it for months now and it's actually changed how I budget.

Then I posted here to see if anyone else cared about this level of detail — turns out I'm not the only nerd. Got some great feedback, found edge cases I hadn't thought of, and realized maybe this is worth sharing.

It's on the App Store now if anyone wants to try it.

Quick rundown: you scan a receipt, it extracts the line items using on-device AI (nothing leaves your phone), suggests category splits, and syncs to YNAB. As far as I know, it's the only receipt scanner that does automatic splits and keeps everything on-device. If I'm wrong, someone please tell me — I looked for months.

There's a free tier (10 scans/month) if you just want to try it without committing. The AI tier is $29.99/year — that's $2.49/month, less than a coffee.

A couple things to know upfront: the AI features require an iPhone that supports Apple Intelligence (iPhone 15 Pro or newer). And the AI learns your category preferences over time, so the first few receipts you'll need to set categories yourself. After 5-10 receipts it gets pretty accurate.

Happy to answer questions if anyone's curious about how it works or wants to tell me what I got wrong.

I'm curious — how would having this level of detail on your receipts help you budget better?

Another week another review, this time I have a new brand (for me) with me. The Soundrhyme and the model is SR10. I was always curious about Penon and the its allied brands. Soundrhyme is one of them. When I first heard Penon voltage I was smitten with the brand. So logically wanted to try all other brands that they carried. In pursuit of it I was on look out for opportunities. When AudioGeek India received Soundrhyme SR10 for tour I expressed my interest in its review. Fast forward few days I received SR10. I was very much excited to try it out. Lets see if it also wins me over like Penon or not.

First of all Huge thank you to Sandeep Bhai the man behind AudioGeek family and also big thanks to Soundrhyme for providing unit for review tour. Without them this review wouldn't be possible.

Please note my bias towards DD > Hybrids > Planars. Also keep in mind my music choices while reading this review. Find it in music genre section.

I was not paid or offered any kind of compensation for this review. All thoughts and views expressed here are mine.

Now that all pleasantries have been exchanged Let us proceed with meat and potatoes of this review.

Build Quality :

I have received in package a case and IEMS + cable with bunch of eartips. I didn't get any retail package so cant talk about it. Carrying case is made up of leather and is of hard type so it can easily protect IEMs. IEMS shells are made up of aluminum. Shells feel lightweight yet solid inspire confidence in them. Design on the shell surface is eye catching. Cable is terminated with 4.4 mm its not modular. It is 0.78 mm 2 pin type. Both 4.4mm jack and terminations are made up of metal feel premium. Cable separator and chin synch both are also made up of metal. Entire cable feels premium. Set comes with 3 sets of different eartips. Each set has all 4 sizes. Two are normal silicone type while the third one is liquid silicone type. Good accessory pack.

Overall Build Quality 5/5

Comfort :

Shells are not large but medium size so fit issue was not there. People with small ears please check fitting before purchase. Nozzles are medium length so deep fit is possible. Nozzles don't have lips on them yet I had no eartip slip offs. Shells don't feel heavy in ears. Don't create any weird pressure or pain in the ears.

Cable is thick yet it doesn't feel too heavy. It is supple to feel. Doesn't tangle. Has no microphonics. Easy to roadie wrap. Chin synch works. It stays in place. Eartips provided cover your need for fitting eartips. All three silicone eartips are soft. Liquid silicone eartips are most comfortable and provide maximum grip.

Overall Comfort 5/5

Configuration :

2DD+4BA+4 Micro planar drivers. Sensitivity 115 dB. Impedance 18ohm. Frequency response 10 Hz to 40 Khz

Ear Tips :

I have used stock wide bore tips with for this review.

Sources :

1.Jcally jm6 type 4.4

2.Moondrop pro

3.Fiio KA3

4.Fiio KA13

5.EPZ TP50

6.Onix Alpha XI 1

7.Cayin RU6

8.Cayin RU7

9.Tempotec V3 Blaze

10.Shanling M1 Plus

\+many more

This IEM is very efficient (115dB ) as when I used jcally jm6 type 4.4 as source it was able to drive this IEM with ease. As I scaled with sources mentioned above it was able to scale along. So IEM is scaling well with powerful sources. Best pairing was achieved with Cayin RU7, Onix Alpha XI 1 & Tempotec V3 blaze,shanling M1 plus.

Sources scalling Tempotec v3 blaze > Cayin RU7> Onix Alpha XI 1 > Cayin Ru6 > EPZ TP50 > Fiio KA13 > Moondrop Dawn pro > Fiio KA3> Jcally jm6

I preferred mostly neutral and dark sources with them. I didnt like presentation with bright sources.

Sound Impressions :

Bass/Lows :

​

One of the best low end ever heard by me in last few years in this budget. It is just amazing. You can hear nuances & texture in the bass. Bass has that sub bass rumble to drool over along with that physical rattling. Mid bass slaps. It feels most authentic. It has physicality that is evident in each bass notes. Drums and kick drums sound exhilarating. You can hear the strike on drum skin and the corresponding reverberations. Its simply surreal. Bass guitars have that physical weight to notes. You can feel the strings being plucked strummed. Simply put the best and the USP of this set is Bass. Its quality + quantity bass.

Overall Bass/Lows 6/5 if I could give it that many points. So 5/5.

Mids :

Vocals are nice. Both male and female vocals shine here. Male vocals get benefit from the bass tuning. Female vocals don't become intense. There is no oddity or abnormalness in vocals.

If sibilance is present in the song it will be felt else there is no sibilance. Vocals are in center or feel center focused.

No smearing or congestion in instruments that reside in the mids. Clarity is good.

Overall Mids 5/5 (please keep in mind that I don't like vocals recessed or too focused and front. I like them balanced compared to Bass and Treble.)

Treble/Highs :

Smooth treble. No harshness or scratchy feeling. No weird peaks. Treble is not that well extended for me as I think it lacks in air region. Yet you will not miss any macro or micro details in the mix. Just this set doesn't puts focus on them. You are not directed towards them by tuning. This creates nice smooth treble with ample details to satisfy that Hi Res itch. Instruments like bells, cymbal crashes, trumpets sound natural.

Soundstage is not too wide nor closed in its in between for me. On first listen it might not feel wide and tall but on long listening sessions you get the actual length and breadth of the soundstage. It creates a good canvas for the instruments to live in harmony.

Overall Treble/Highs 4.5/5 ( please understand the 0.5 taken out due to my preference for more of the soundstage)

Song Impressions :

I have included my impressions of few songs to co-relate with my findings in sound impressions.

1.Caravan by John Wasson

This Song has one of the best drum beats and overall synergy between instruments. The drum beats sound authentic like real thing. Cymbal crashes sound natural. Strings have the oomph that you fell when they are strummed. Trumpets are amazing. No smearing or congestion when so many instruments are playing at the same time. No off timbre you can hear. Song doesn't get intense. One of the best reproduction of this song.

My heart will go on by Celine Dior

One of my female vocal check song. In this song Celin Dior sounds divine. They captivate you. On SR10 that magic of her voice is missing. Her charm doesn't grip you. Other aspects such as instruments are well produced. Vocals are let down on this song. Overall acceptable reproduction.

Angel by Massive Attack

This song has sub bass droning in entire song. This is on point in SR10. Sub bass rumble is excellent. Mid bass is slamming. Vocals sound as they should in this song. Even with such strong bass performance the bass does not over power other aspects in the mix. You can hear all the details. No smearing or congestion is felt. Drivers resolve very well. This song on poor resolution drivers can sound bit congested and you won't hear proper separation in instruments. No such issues here. Fabulous reproduction of this song.

Hotel California by Eagles Live version

This song is nothing but reference point as any audiophile worth his salt has heard it and has it in their library. So using it as reference. Well the heart of this song is guitars and they are excellent here. Strings have note weight. You can feel it. Drums are on point. Vocals sound as they are meant to be. Cymbal crashes sound natural. All instruments sound well separated. No smearing or congestion is felt in the mix. One of the best reproduction of this song. I enjoyed every second of it.

Final Conclusion :

This is my first ever encounter with Soundrhyme brand and this is the first ever set from them I have heard from them. So what are my final thoughts about it ? Well I think this was great first introduction to this brand. The build quality is excellent. Design is eye catching. Accessories game is on point. So full marks on it. Yet when it comes to tuning. I feel this set fails on few fronts for me . Mainly in vocal reproduction and soundstage. Vocals don't sound impressive. They don't evoke emotions specifically female vocals. Soundstage is good for the price point but not up to the level i had opportunity to listen.

What about rest? Well bass is the main star here. One of the best bass I have heard for the price point. This has both quantity and quality. If you are bass lover you are covered here. For bas tuning full marks to Soundrhyme. Clarity is on par to sets priced similar but clarity tad bit lesser compared to some of them. Treble is another place where they have paid special attention it seems. It is smooth. No harshness or quirkiness. You can hear fatigue free for hours due to this. Details are good but not class leading. Separation and layering is on average.

Who should get this set bass lovers. Who should not get this set if you are neutral lover or treble lover. If you like vocals this is a may be set for you. Please take my impressions with grain of salt as I am just one person and these are my views. My ratings are based on its price and its performance. If this was less than 200 USD set it would have become 5/5 set instantly. I have to be extra critical with sets priced higher than 300 USD as its significant sum.

Thank you for enduring with me till end. Now go grab cup of coffee and lets enjoy getting high on safe high i.e. Music.

Every morning, everyone has to go over the twenty-foot wall to go to work. 

1. Most people have key cards that allow them inside an elevator that takes them to a skybridge that goes over the wall. Effortless. 
2. Others aren't as lucky and are given regular keys that unlock a door leading to stairs to the same skybridge. But still not terrible. 
3. Some people lost their keys, but they were given free ladders tall enough to reach a 15-foot high platform. On that platform is a big trampoline. Jump on it, and you can leap over the wall. More effort, but still very doable.
4. Unfortunately, your boss hates you and you're the shortest guy in the complex to boot. So no keys, no ladders, and no trampolines for you. 

Your boss says, ""Jump as high as you can. You can jump over a 20 foot wall! If you don't, you aren't trying hard enough!""

Of course, this is cruel mockery. It's humanly impossible to jump up 20 feet!

Worse of all, people in groups 2 and 3 also bash you for not trying hard enough. ""I had to wait in line and work hard to climb up the ladder and jump on the trampoline. Why can't you do the same?"" What they don't know is that your boss sent you a private memo threatening to fire you if you use the ladder even just once.

  
Fortunately, one friend sends you a grappling hook. Another sends you a pogo stick. You look around, and there are in fact a handful of sturdy but small, protruding ledges, at varying heights, dotted around the wall. With some grappling hook practice, you're able to Tarzan your way from lowest ledge to the highest ledge, which is still six feet below the top of the wall. At this point, though, you can use your pogo stick to jump over the wall.

\--------------------------------------------------------------

Let me explain the analogy:

Leaping over the 20 foot wall: Baseline, bare minimum level of energy you need to function. If you only go up to 19 feet, it's no good. It's just as bad as staying on the ground! And that's how it feels like with sleep--below a hard threshold of sleep efficiency of about 85%, productivity collapses!

Group 1: Normal people under normal conditions

Group 2: Normal people relying on coffee so they can work long hours

Group 3: Parents of newborns

Group 4: People with Narcolepsy/IH

Grappling Hook + pogo stick: Narcolepsy/IH treatment. Neither the grappling hook nor pogo stick alone can get you over the 20 foot wall. But combined, they will. Just like how Narcolepsy/IH treatment must be multi-pronged--not solely medication, not solely diet/exercise, not solely sleep hygiene, but all of them combined.

1qkyat8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qkyat8,"Owning the F77 as an early buyer: brilliant in the city, complicated to live with.","# Disclaimer

This post reflects my personal ownership and service experience with this motorcycle. I’m not making allegations of fraud, illegality, or intentional wrongdoing by the manufacturer or its employees. This is just my experience; others may have had a very different one.

Background

\* Bike: F77 Limited Edition

\* Ownership: Early / first-batch owner

\* Usage: Mostly city riding (Bangalore)

\* Distance covered: \~3,200 km

I’m writing this mainly for people who are still on the fence about buying this bike. This isn’t a rant or a hit piece, just an honest account of what living with it has been like for me.

# 1. What the Bike Absolutely Nails

\* For city riding, this bike is honestly fantastic... The instant torque (100 Nm) is more than enough, and to be frank, Ballistic mode is overkill for a city like Bangalore with constant bumper-to-bumper traffic. Even in calmer modes, the bike never feels dull; throttle response is immediate and addictive.

\* Once you’re moving, the bike rarely disappoints. The weight is very noticeable at slow speeds, but that sensation largely disappears once the bike is rolling.

\* It’s also a proper looker. The bike gets attention everywhere. Sometimes that’s fun, sometimes not, especially when it draws unnecessary scrutiny from traffic cops who seem quicker to question you simply because the bike looks expensive.

\* The suspension deserves genuine praise. It’s shockingly plush and comfortable. Despite the sport-leaning stance, I’ve had no back pain so far. Most of my rides are night rides lasting an hour or two with a coffee break in between, and comfort has never been an issue.

#   2. Mixed Feelings on Design & Daily Use

\* One area that genuinely disappointed me was the headlight performance. Night-time visibility is poor, and there were multiple instances where potholes were barely visible until the last moment. For a bike in this price segment, this was not something I expected and it did affect confidence during night rides.

\* The display works, but it’s on the smaller side. In real-world riding, especially at night, the only thing that’s consistently easy to read is the speed. 

\* The Mappls navigation remains laggy, pretty much like it was on day one. I’ve never been able to fully rely on it.

\* The side mirrors are oddly shaped and hard to adjust. In my case, one mirror loosened at higher speeds and wouldn’t stay in position for the rest of the ride home annoying and distracting. 

\* Initially, the bike felt tight and solid, but over time, small squeaks and noises started appearing during handle movement and turns. Nothing felt unsafe, but it does take away from the premium feel.

\* I do appreciate how cleanly the cables are hidden. There’s a fair bit of plastic used, but plastic doesn’t automatically mean cheap. The parts don’t feel flimsy, and using heavier materials everywhere would likely push the bike well beyond its already hefty \~207 kg.

# 3. Early Owner Realities (First-Batch Stuff)

\* As one of the early owners, I think it’s only fair to mention some initial-batch teething issues.

\* One major problem was the tail section. My tailgate developed aggressive vibrations, and over time, the vibration became so severe that the tailgate broke on its own, without any external impact. That was genuinely shocking.

\* The fix came in the form of a metal reinforcement bracket, and since that was installed, the issue appears to be resolved. Credit where it’s due. The fix actually works.

\* Similarly, the charging lid, which was originally plastic, was later replaced with an aluminium charging lid. This was a solid upgrade in terms of durability and feel.

\* That said, both of these were paid upgrades. Neither the tailgate fix nor the aluminium charging lid was provided free of cost.

\* Another disappointment was that TPMS didn’t come as standard on a bike at this price and had to be added later.

#  4. Braking Behaviour (Early Ownership Concern)

\* At the time of delivery, I was advised to use a 70:30 front-to-rear braking ratio due to the bike’s front-heavy nature. While I understand this, I personally found the rear brake to offer very limited stopping power, which further increased reliance on the front brakes during daily riding.

\* One of my earliest and most unsettling experiences involved abnormal braking behavior. On multiple occasions, braking input didn’t result in the expected deceleration, and the brake lever would travel unusually far. In those moments, I had to fully release and reapply the brake to get braking response back.

\* This happened intermittently and without warning, which was especially uncomfortable in traffic. I’m not making any technical diagnosis, but as a rider, this reduced my confidence in the braking system, including the ABS.

\* I raised this during service visits, and after repeated follow-ups, corrective work was carried out. Even though the behavior wasn’t consistently reproducible afterward, the experience stayed with me.

#  5. Front Brake Pads Replaced Very Early (Invoice-Backed)

\* This is where things really stood out for me.

\* October 2024: Front brake pads replaced at \~2,212 km

\* May 2025: Paid service at \~2,717 km

\* August 2025: Front brake pads replaced again at \~2,990 km

\* So yes, front brake pads were replaced twice before the bike even crossed 3,000 km.

\* For mostly city riding, that felt unusually early and added to my concerns around braking durability.

# 6. Accident, Repairs & Insurance Reality Check

\* I was involved in a major accident that damaged multiple parts of the bike.

\* Total repair bill: ₹52,004 (paid)

\* Since my bike is a Limited Edition, it comes with a specific numbered side-fairing sticker. After accident-related repairs, for which I was charged fully. The bike was returned without the sticker, citing a stock issue. This went on for over a month, and when the sticker was finally installed, it turned out to be the wrong number. To their credit, the bike was later picked up free of cost and corrected, but the entire episode was unnecessarily drawn out.

\* That alone was a reality check on how expensive body panels and fairings and other parts are.

\* The insurance experience added to the frustration. I had taken insurance through the recommended channel at purchase. When I tried to claim for accident repairs, I was informed that my policy had effectively become third-party only, meaning own-damage wasn’t covered at that point.

\* End result: I paid roughly ₹25,000 out of pocket. While this may align with policy terms, I only fully understood this when I actually tried to make a claim.

Total accident-related repair bill: \~₹52,000 (parts + labour, invoice-backed)

Individually, none of these numbers look outrageous, but when multiple parts need replacement together, the costs add up very quickly, which is what caught me off guard.

 

# 7. Delayed Delivery of the UV LYNC / Sync Adapter

\* One other experience worth mentioning was the delay in receiving the UV LYNC (Sync) adapter that I had ordered separately.

\* The order was placed in April 2025, but the product was shipped only in December 2025, roughly seven and a half months later. I eventually did receive it, but the lack of a clear delivery timeline and the need for multiple follow-ups added to the overall frustration.

\* I’ve attached screenshots of the order confirmation and shipping notification emails with timestamps for context.

# 8. Servicing & the “EV Savings” Reality

\* One small but frustrating service-related experience involved wheel balancers. They were present at the time of delivery and naturally wore off over usage. During a later service visit, I explicitly requested that they be reinstalled. However, when the bike was returned, the balancers were not fitted, and I was told during delivery that they were “not necessary.” While this may seem minor, it added to the feeling of certain requests being sidelined rather than properly addressed.

\* A lot is said about fuel savings with EVs, which is fair. But servicing needs a reality check.

\* This isn’t a bike you can take to just any local garage. EVs require specific knowledge, which in practice forces you to rely on brand service centres.

\* Service costs on their own may be reasonable given the bike’s price, but don’t assume brake pads are the only expense. That might be true for some owners; my experience was different.

#  9. A Quick Note on Service Costs

\* I know some will say that for a bike costing around ₹5.8 lakh on-road, service bills of ₹5,000+ are expected. That’s fair, and that’s not the complaint here.

\* This post is for people still deciding whether to pull the trigger. Financial situations differ, and what feels acceptable for one owner may not for another. My goal is simply to help set realistic expectations.

#  10. One Last Thing

\* I know some will argue that 3,000 km is too little to judge a bike. That’s a fair point. But for me, the concern was having this many issues within just 3,000 km, especially so early into ownership.

\* That said, I don’t regret buying this bike at all. I genuinely love it, and riding it still gives me the same level of joy it did on day one. That’s exactly why I cared enough  to wrote all of this. 

# TL;DR

1.Early owner of the F77 (\~3,200 km, mostly city riding in Bangalore)

2. Brilliant city bike: instant torque, smooth power delivery, very comfortable suspension

3. Heavy at low speeds, but excellent once moving; still love riding it

4. Early-batch issues: tailgate vibration (fixed with paid metal bracket), plastic charging lid upgraded to aluminium (paid), TPMS not standard

5. Experienced abnormal braking behaviour early on; front brake pads replaced twice before 3,000 km

6. Rear brake feels weak, increasing reliance on the front

7. Accident repairs cost \~₹52k; insurance didn’t cover \~₹25k due to TP-only policy

8. UV LYNC adapter delivery took \~7.5 months

9. EV servicing ties you largely to brand service centres; ownership isn’t as “low-cost” as it sounds

10. Don’t regret buying it at all. Riding it still gives me the same joy it did on day one",5,1769191968.0,indianbikes,7,1.0,False
1qkyaot,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TrafficMasterB/comments/1qkyaot/how_to_build_a_home_that_feels_inviting_yearround/,How to Build a Home That Feels Inviting Year-Round,"https://preview.redd.it/2t7an31045fg1.jpg?width=8688&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91b1f48375d76d5d1ac52a20531706250b221cfe

  
An inviting home does not involve changing with the seasons. A home that is inviting regardless of the season is the home that is easily adaptable. It can provide warmth during the winter season, provide openness during the spring season, and provide simplicity during the daily routine.

Instead of designing for an occasion, it’s about designing environments that feel good to be in all the time. It’s really about finding materials and aesthetics that are comfortable yet robust and beautiful yet functional.

* **Start with Comfort that Lasts Beyond One Season**

Seating is the center of interest of a welcoming home. It is a place for congregating, relaxing, and spending time. It is imperative to ensure this seating area remains comfortable all year round.

High-quality cushions for your lounge chairs can also contribute significantly in such ways. Cushions with proper support that are designed to retain their shape are perfect for a seating area since you can always count on them for comfort, especially during those long winter or summer days.

How can I ensure that my seating is comfortable not just for my visitors but for myself as well?

Emphasize quality and fit. When you have properly made and sized couch cushions for your furniture, you can enjoy being at home just as you enjoy entertaining.

* **A layer for Flexibility, Not Extravagance**

An appealing home does not look cluttered, an appealing home looks thought out. Textiles can enhance layering, making it easy to switch with the seasons without needing to redecorate.

Using such blankets can be one of the easiest ways to implement the above. These blankets are light enough to be worked with in the transitional seasons of the year but offer the ability to be warm in the evenings too. They are ideal for adding some warmth to the room without affecting the room in a heavy way.

This makes your home retain a peaceful appearance while still enjoying a physically comfortable environment.

* **Materials for the Real World**

Inviting homes aren’t priceless—They are lived in. So, selecting materials for your home with enough durability to withstand sunlight, purposeful usage, and varying circumstances wouldn’t make your home less desirable.

For areas where there is natural sunlight or access to outdoor areas, [Sunbrella fabric outdoor cushions](https://www.fabricakraft.com/collections/sunbrella-cushions) provide an excellent solution. This is because these cushions retain their appearance no matter how often they are used, making them perfect for areas such as living rooms or sunrooms or for an indoor-outdoor setting.

**Are there performance fabrics that are warm and inviting as well as functional?**

Yes. When properly selected, performance fabrics provide durability without compromising comfort. This makes them highly ideal for year-round use.

* **Careful details that encourage gathering**

An appealing home also facilitates connection. Some small, practical details can create a sense of warmth when engaging in simple interactions.

In the dining and coffee lounges, the addition of sustainable drinking containers not only promotes casual socializing, but the use of resilient and well-designed drinking containers is also suitable for everyday life as well as events, and the message of comfort and convenience is further perpetuated.

**How can I make my home more welcoming without constantly decorating?**

Opt for versatile pieces that can be used in more than one way. If your basic components of soft elements like textiles and accessories are in harmony, then it wouldn’t be an issue to have an inviting space that doesn’t change much every now and then.

* **A Home that Evolves with You**

Creating a welcoming home throughout the year is not a matter of following the trends or seasonal decorating. It is all about establishing a firm base that is founded on comfort, flexibility, and quality. With encouraging [lounge chair cushions](https://www.fabricakraft.com/collections/sunbrella-cushions), flexible layers in sustainable blankets, long-lasting Sunbrella fabric cushions, and necessary items in everyday life like sustainable drinkware, your home is now a place that makes a welcoming environment for yourself and others effortlessly. It is this consistency that makes your home welcoming all year long.",1,1769191960.0,u_TrafficMasterB,0,1.0,False

Another week another review, this time I have a new brand (for me) with me. The Soundrhyme and the model is SR10. I was always curious about Penon and the its allied brands. Soundrhyme is one of them. When I first heard Penon voltage I was smitten with the brand. So logically wanted to try all other brands that they carried. In pursuit of it I was on look out for opportunities. When AudioGeek India received Soundrhyme SR10 for tour I expressed my interest in its review. Fast forward few days I received SR10. I was very much excited to try it out. Lets see if it also wins me over like Penon or not.

First of all Huge thank you to Sandeep Bhai the man behind AudioGeek family and also big thanks to Soundrhyme for providing unit for review tour. Without them this review wouldn't be possible.

Please note my bias towards DD > Hybrids > Planars. Also keep in mind my music choices while reading this review. Find it in music genre section.

I was not paid or offered any kind of compensation for this review. All thoughts and views expressed here are mine.

Now that all pleasantries have been exchanged Let us proceed with meat and potatoes of this review.

Build Quality :

I have received in package a case and IEMS + cable with bunch of eartips. I didn't get any retail package so cant talk about it. Carrying case is made up of leather and is of hard type so it can easily protect IEMs. IEMS shells are made up of aluminum. Shells feel lightweight yet solid inspire confidence in them. Design on the shell surface is eye catching. Cable is terminated with 4.4 mm its not modular. It is 0.78 mm 2 pin type. Both 4.4mm jack and terminations are made up of metal feel premium. Cable separator and chin synch both are also made up of metal. Entire cable feels premium. Set comes with 3 sets of different eartips. Each set has all 4 sizes. Two are normal silicone type while the third one is liquid silicone type. Good accessory pack.

Overall Build Quality 5/5

Comfort :

Shells are not large but medium size so fit issue was not there. People with small ears please check fitting before purchase. Nozzles are medium length so deep fit is possible. Nozzles don't have lips on them yet I had no eartip slip offs. Shells don't feel heavy in ears. Don't create any weird pressure or pain in the ears.

Cable is thick yet it doesn't feel too heavy. It is supple to feel. Doesn't tangle. Has no microphonics. Easy to roadie wrap. Chin synch works. It stays in place. Eartips provided cover your need for fitting eartips. All three silicone eartips are soft. Liquid silicone eartips are most comfortable and provide maximum grip.

Overall Comfort 5/5

Configuration :

2DD+4BA+4 Micro planar drivers. Sensitivity 115 dB. Impedance 18ohm. Frequency response 10 Hz to 40 Khz

Ear Tips :

I have used stock wide bore tips with for this review.

6.Onix Alpha XI 1

7.Cayin RU6

8.Cayin RU7

9.Tempotec V3 Blaze

10.Shanling M1 Plus

\+many more

This IEM is very efficient (115dB ) as when I used jcally jm6 type 4.4 as source it was able to drive this IEM with ease. As I scaled with sources mentioned above it was able to scale along. So IEM is scaling well with powerful sources. Best pairing was achieved with Cayin RU7, Onix Alpha XI 1 & Tempotec V3 blaze,shanling M1 plus.

Sources scalling Tempotec v3 blaze > Cayin RU7> Onix Alpha XI 1 > Cayin Ru6 > EPZ TP50 > Fiio KA13 > Moondrop Dawn pro > Fiio KA3> Jcally jm6

I preferred mostly neutral and dark sources with them. I didnt like presentation with bright sources.

Sound Impressions :

Bass/Lows :

​

One of the best low end ever heard by me in last few years in this budget. It is just amazing. You can hear nuances & texture in the bass. Bass has that sub bass rumble to drool over along with that physical rattling. Mid bass slaps. It feels most authentic. It has physicality that is evident in each bass notes. Drums and kick drums sound exhilarating. You can hear the strike on drum skin and the corresponding reverberations. Its simply surreal. Bass guitars have that physical weight to notes. You can feel the strings being plucked strummed. Simply put the best and the USP of this set is Bass. Its quality + quantity bass.

Overall Bass/Lows 6/5 if I could give it that many points. So 5/5.

Mids :

Vocals are nice. Both male and female vocals shine here. Male vocals get benefit from the bass tuning. Female vocals don't become intense. There is no oddity or abnormalness in vocals.

If sibilance is present in the song it will be felt else there is no sibilance. Vocals are in center or feel center focused.

No smearing or congestion in instruments that reside in the mids. Clarity is good.

Overall Mids 5/5 (please keep in mind that I don't like vocals recessed or too focused and front. I like them balanced compared to Bass and Treble.)

Treble/Highs :

Smooth treble. No harshness or scratchy feeling. No weird peaks. Treble is not that well extended for me as I think it lacks in air region. Yet you will not miss any macro or micro details in the mix. Just this set doesn't puts focus on them. You are not directed towards them by tuning. This creates nice smooth treble with ample details to satisfy that Hi Res itch. Instruments like bells, cymbal crashes, trumpets sound natural.

Soundstage is not too wide nor closed in its in between for me. On first listen it might not feel wide and tall but on long listening sessions you get the actual length and breadth of the soundstage. It creates a good canvas for the instruments to live in harmony.

Overall Treble/Highs 4.5/5 ( please understand the 0.5 taken out due to my preference for more of the soundstage)

Song Impressions :

I have included my impressions of few songs to co-relate with my findings in sound impressions.

1.Caravan by John Wasson

This Song has one of the best drum beats and overall synergy between instruments. The drum beats sound authentic like real thing. Cymbal crashes sound natural. Strings have the oomph that you fell when they are strummed. Trumpets are amazing. No smearing or congestion when so many instruments are playing at the same time. No off timbre you can hear. Song doesn't get intense. One of the best reproduction of this song.

My heart will go on by Celine Dior

One of my female vocal check song. In this song Celin Dior sounds divine. They captivate you. On SR10 that magic of her voice is missing. Her charm doesn't grip you. Other aspects such as instruments are well produced. Vocals are let down on this song. Overall acceptable reproduction.

Angel by Massive Attack

This song has sub bass droning in entire song. This is on point in SR10. Sub bass rumble is excellent. Mid bass is slamming. Vocals sound as they should in this song. Even with such strong bass performance the bass does not over power other aspects in the mix. You can hear all the details. No smearing or congestion is felt. Drivers resolve very well. This song on poor resolution drivers can sound bit congested and you won't hear proper separation in instruments. No such issues here. Fabulous reproduction of this song.

Hotel California by Eagles Live version

This song is nothing but reference point as any audiophile worth his salt has heard it and has it in their library. So using it as reference. Well the heart of this song is guitars and they are excellent here. Strings have note weight. You can feel it. Drums are on point. Vocals sound as they are meant to be. Cymbal crashes sound natural. All instruments sound well separated. No smearing or congestion is felt in the mix. One of the best reproduction of this song. I enjoyed every second of it.

Final Conclusion :

This is my first ever encounter with Soundrhyme brand and this is the first ever set from them I have heard from them. So what are my final thoughts about it ? Well I think this was great first introduction to this brand. The build quality is excellent. Design is eye catching. Accessories game is on point. So full marks on it. Yet when it comes to tuning. I feel this set fails on few fronts for me . Mainly in vocal reproduction and soundstage. Vocals don't sound impressive. They don't evoke emotions specifically female vocals. Soundstage is good for the price point but not up to the level i had opportunity to listen.

What about rest? Well bass is the main star here. One of the best bass I have heard for the price point. This has both quantity and quality. If you are bass lover you are covered here. For bas tuning full marks to Soundrhyme. Clarity is on par to sets priced similar but clarity tad bit lesser compared to some of them. Treble is another place where they have paid special attention it seems. It is smooth. No harshness or quirkiness. You can hear fatigue free for hours due to this. Details are good but not class leading. Separation and layering is on average.

Who should get this set bass lovers. Who should not get this set if you are neutral lover or treble lover. If you like vocals this is a may be set for you. Please take my impressions with grain of salt as I am just one person and these are my views. My ratings are based on its price and its performance. If this was less than 200 USD set it would have become 5/5 set instantly. I have to be extra critical with sets priced higher than 300 USD as its significant sum.

Thank you for enduring with me till end. Now go grab cup of coffee and lets enjoy getting high on safe high i.e. Music.

1qky8mk,https://www.reddit.com/r/GroundedMentality/comments/1qky8mk/how_to_talk_to_women_without_being_weird/,How to Talk to Women Without Being Weird: Science-Based Social Skills That Actually Work,"honestly, i spent way too much time studying this. read books, listened to podcasts, watched way too many youtube videos about social dynamics and psychology. but here's what actually works.

most guys overthink this to death. they treat conversations with women like some kind of nuclear disarmament negotiation. or they swing the other way and use pickup lines that make everyone cringe. the real issue? we're never taught how to just be normal humans around half the population.

here's the thing though. it's not entirely your fault. society bombards us with contradictory messages. be confident but not arrogant. be interested but not desperate. be yourself but also be mysterious. like wtf does that even mean? plus our biology makes us nervous wrecks when we're attracted to someone. but you can absolutely get better at this with practice and the right mental frameworks.

stop treating it like a performance

biggest mistake guys make is thinking they need to ""impress"" women. you're not auditioning for a role. you're seeing if you actually enjoy talking to this person.

when you shift from ""i need her to like me"" to ""let me see if we vibe,"" everything changes. suddenly you're not monitoring every word. you're actually present. this comes from research on attachment theory and social psychology. people can smell desperation from a mile away because it shows up in micro expressions, tone, body language.

start conversations about literally anything in your immediate environment. ""this coffee shop has the weirdest menu"" or ""did you see that guy trying to parallel park outside?"" context based openers feel natural because they are natural. no one thinks you're hitting on them when you comment on shared reality.

ask questions like you're actually curious

most people (not just guys) are terrible at conversations because they're just waiting for their turn to talk. they ask a question then immediately pivot to their own story.

instead, ask followup questions. when she mentions she went hiking last weekend, don't launch into your hiking story. ask where she went. what made her choose that trail. does she hike often. this builds actual connection.

[Mark Manson's Models: Attract Women Through Honesty](https://markmanson.net/) has credentials in dating and relationship psychology and this book genuinely changed how i think about connections. it strips away all the manipulative pickup artist bs and focuses on authentic connection. the core idea is that being genuinely interested in someone as a human is more attractive than any technique. sounds simple but it's insanely powerful when you actually do it.

share things about yourself too

conversations aren't interrogations. the question, answer, question format gets boring fast.

mix in observations and stories. ""oh you're into photography? i've been trying to get better at taking pics of my dog but he never stays still. it's like herding cats but worse."" now she can relate, laugh, share her own pet stories.

the pause is your friend

silence makes people uncomfortable so they fill it with word vomit. resist that urge.

if you ask something and there's a pause while she thinks, just wait. comfortable silence shows confidence. it also gives both of you time to actually think instead of just reacting.

research on conversation dynamics shows that rushed conversations feel transactional. pauses allow for depth. they signal you're not desperate to keep her attention every single second.

body language matters more than words

stand or sit at a slight angle rather than directly facing her, especially early in the conversation. direct facing can feel intense. open body language, don't cross your arms. maintain eye contact but not in a serial killer way. look away occasionally, it's natural.

know when to end the conversation

this is crucial and most guys mess it up. they finally get a good conversation going and then... just keep talking until it dies awkwardly.

end on a high note. ""hey this was actually really fun talking to you, but i gotta run. maybe we could continue this over coffee sometime?"" or even just ""cool chatting with you"" and leave.

leaving when things are going well creates positive association. it also shows you have your own life and aren't desperately clinging to every interaction.

practice everywhere with everyone

talk to the barista about their day. chat with the person next to you on the bus. compliment the old lady's dog.

socializing is a skill and skills require practice. when you practice conversations without any agenda or pressure, you get comfortable with the mechanics. then when you talk to someone you're attracted to, it's not this massive event. it's just another conversation.

rejection isn't about you

she might be having a terrible day. might be in a relationship. might not be into guys. might just not be feeling social.

if someone doesn't want to talk, they're not rejecting your entire existence. they're declining one specific interaction. the difference matters for your mental health.

[The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane](https://www.oliviafoxcabane.com/)

Cabane's an executive coach who's worked with everyone from Google to Harvard Business School. This book breaks down charisma into learnable behaviors: presence, warmth, and power.

The presence part is huge. being fully present in conversations rather than stuck in your head worrying about what to say next. She gives specific exercises. Honestly one of the best communication books period, not just for talking to women.

[The Art of Charm Podcast](https://www.theartofcharm.com/)

[Jordan Harbinger](https://www.jordanharbinger.com/) breaks down social dynamics, body language, networking. lots of episodes specifically about conversation skills and confidence. he brings on psychologists, fbi negotiators, researchers.

the episode with [Vanessa Van Edwards](https://www.vanessavanewards.com/) about body language cues is incredible. she explains microexpressions and what people's nonverbal communication actually means. helps you read situations better so you're not just guessing.

[BeFreed](https://www.befreed.ai/) is an AI-powered personalized learning app that's been solid for building these conversation and social skills consistently. Built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google, it transforms content from books, research papers, and expert talks into custom podcasts tailored to your specific goals. Type in what you're working on, like talking to women without anxiety or building genuine confidence, and it pulls from vetted sources to create a learning plan just for you. You control the depth, from a 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and context. The voice options are genuinely addictive too, everything from calm and educational to sarcastic depending on your mood. Makes it easy to fit real growth into commute time or gym sessions without feeling like work.

bottom line? women are just people. they're not a different species requiring special decoder rings. the same things that make you interesting in conversations with guys apply here. be genuine, be present, be curious about who they are.

practice builds confidence. confidence isn't thinking ""she'll definitely like me."" it's thinking ""if this doesn't work out, i'll be fine."" that removes the desperation and makes you way more attractive because you're just being yourself without apology.

stop consuming content about ""how to talk to women"" after this and just go talk to actual humans. you'll learn more in ten real conversations than reading a hundred articles.",1,1769191835.0,GroundedMentality,0,1.0,False

Nozzles don't have lips on them yet I had no eartip slip offs. Shells don't feel heavy in ears. Don't create any weird pressure or pain in the ears.

Cable is thick yet it doesn't feel too heavy. It is supple to feel. Doesn't tangle. Has no microphonics. Easy to roadie wrap. Chin synch works. It stays in place. Eartips provided cover your need for fitting eartips. All three silicone eartips are soft. Liquid silicone eartips are most comfortable and provide maximum grip.

Overall Comfort 5/5

This IEM is very efficient (115dB ) as when I used jcally jm6 type 4.4 as source it was able to drive this IEM with ease. As I scaled with sources mentioned above it was able to scale along. So IEM is scaling well with powerful sources. Best pairing was achieved with Cayin RU7, Onix Alpha XI 1 & Tempotec V3 blaze,shanling M1 plus.

Sound Impressions :

Bass/Lows :

​

One of the best low end ever heard by me in last few years in this budget. It is just amazing. You can hear nuances & texture in the bass. Bass has that sub bass rumble to drool over along with that physical rattling. Mid bass slaps. It feels most authentic. It has physicality that is evident in each bass notes. Drums and kick drums sound exhilarating. You can hear the strike on drum skin and the corresponding reverberations. Its simply surreal. Bass guitars have that physical weight to notes. You can feel the strings being plucked strummed. Simply put the best and the USP of this set is Bass. Its quality + quantity bass.

Overall Bass/Lows 6/5 if I could give it that many points. So 5/5.

Mids :

Vocals are nice. Both male and female vocals shine here. Male vocals get benefit from the bass tuning. Female vocals don't become intense. There is no oddity or abnormalness in vocals.

If sibilance is present in the song it will be felt else there is no sibilance. Vocals are in center or feel center focused.

No smearing or congestion in instruments that reside in the mids. Clarity is good.

Overall Mids 5/5 (please keep in mind that I don't like vocals recessed or too focused and front. I like them balanced compared to Bass and Treble.)

Treble/Highs :

Smooth treble. No harshness or scratchy feeling. No weird peaks. Treble is not that well extended for me as I think it lacks in air region. Yet you will not miss any macro or micro details in the mix. Just this set doesn't puts focus on them. You are not directed towards them by tuning. This creates nice smooth treble with ample details to satisfy that Hi Res itch. Instruments like bells, cymbal crashes, trumpets sound natural.

Soundstage is not too wide nor closed in its in between for me. On first listen it might not feel wide and tall but on long listening sessions you get the actual length and breadth of the soundstage. It creates a good canvas for the instruments to live in harmony.

Overall Treble/Highs 4.5/5 ( please understand the 0.5 taken out due to my preference for more of the soundstage)

Song Impressions :

I have included my impressions of few songs to co-relate with my findings in sound impressions.

1.Caravan by John Wasson

This Song has one of the best drum beats and overall synergy between instruments. The drum beats sound authentic like real thing. Cymbal crashes sound natural. Strings have the oomph that you fell when they are strummed. Trumpets are amazing. No smearing or congestion when so many instruments are playing at the same time. No off timbre you can hear. Song doesn't get intense. One of the best reproduction of this song.

My heart will go on by Celine Dior

One of my female vocal check song. In this song Celin Dior sounds divine. They captivate you. On SR10 that magic of her voice is missing. Her charm doesn't grip you. Other aspects such as instruments are well produced. Vocals are let down on this song. Overall acceptable reproduction.

Angel by Massive Attack

This song has sub bass droning in entire song. This is on point in SR10. Sub bass rumble is excellent. Mid bass is slamming. Vocals sound as they should in this song. Even with such strong bass performance the bass does not over power other aspects in the mix. You can hear all the details. No smearing or congestion is felt. Drivers resolve very well. This song on poor resolution drivers can sound bit congested and you won't hear proper separation in instruments. No such issues here. Fabulous reproduction of this song.

Hotel California by Eagles Live version

This song is nothing but reference point as any audiophile worth his salt has heard it and has it in their library. So using it as reference. Well the heart of this song is guitars and they are excellent here. Strings have note weight. You can feel it. Drums are on point. Vocals sound as they are meant to be. Cymbal crashes sound natural. All instruments sound well separated. No smearing or congestion is felt in the mix. One of the best reproduction of this song. I enjoyed every second of it.

Final Conclusion :

This is my first ever encounter with Soundrhyme brand and this is the first ever set from them I have heard from them. So what are my final thoughts about it ? Well I think this was great first introduction to this brand. The build quality is excellent. Design is eye catching. Accessories game is on point. So full marks on it. Yet when it comes to tuning. I feel this set fails on few fronts for me . Mainly in vocal reproduction and soundstage. Vocals don't sound impressive. They don't evoke emotions specifically female vocals. Soundstage is good for the price point but not up to the level i had opportunity to listen.

What about rest? Well bass is the main star here. One of the best bass I have heard for the price point. This has both quantity and quality. If you are bass lover you are covered here. For bas tuning full marks to Soundrhyme. Clarity is on par to sets priced similar but clarity tad bit lesser compared to some of them. Treble is another place where they have paid special attention it seems. It is smooth. No harshness or quirkiness. You can hear fatigue free for hours due to this. Details are good but not class leading. Separation and layering is on average.

Who should get this set bass lovers. Who should not get this set if you are neutral lover or treble lover. If you like vocals this is a may be set for you. Please take my impressions with grain of salt as I am just one person and these are my views. My ratings are based on its price and its performance. If this was less than 200 USD set it would have become 5/5 set instantly. I have to be extra critical with sets priced higher than 300 USD as its significant sum.

Thank you for enduring with me till end. Now go grab cup of coffee and lets enjoy getting high on safe high i.e. Music.

I (m35) met this lady (f50) this morning for a coffee date. We are both happy in our single life’s but she approached me on a dating app and we’ve had a nice back and forth chat (unlike most online dating matches…)

I felt it wouldn’t hurt to at least meet, so we arranged for a coffee this morning.

It all went well and was relaxed. We were both a bit nervous but chatty, laughing and she asked loads of questions with genuine interest. She’s really interesting and funny.

It turns out she used to live next to my mum, which we laughed about etc.

When we decided to leave because car parking was running out, I walked her out of the coffee shop and wasn’t sure whether to just kind of hug and say goodbye, nice to meet you etc (that’s how most of my dates have always ended, barring the odd kiss on certain night time dates with drinks etc.) I was waiting to kind of read the vibe but she sort of said ‘bye, nice to meet you’ and headed straight for her car. I totally get she was anxious about getting a ticket for the parking but she kind of said it whilst sideways on and walking off. I wasn’t sure if she just wanted to get the hell out or sometimes that’s just how these things go?

Her body language was very open during the coffee and she was leaning forward a lot and very chatty, so I’m not sure.

I was going to message to at least say it was nice to meet etc. I just can’t gauge if she is interested in a second date.

All this being said, she literally just messaged to say ‘so nice to meet you and can’t believe I know your mum haha’

I guess I can just ask if she wants to do it again but make it very low pressure on her part.

Would you take the ending as a certain she’s not interested?",1,1769191569.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Another week another review, this time I have a new brand (for me) with me. The Soundrhyme and the model is SR10. I was always curious about Penon and the its allied brands. Soundrhyme is one of them. When I first heard Penon voltage I was smitten with the brand. So logically wanted to try all other brands that they carried. In pursuit of it I was on look out for opportunities. When AudioGeek India received Soundrhyme SR10 for tour I expressed my interest in its review. Fast forward few days I received SR10. I was very much excited to try it out. Lets see if it also wins me over like Penon or not.

First of all Huge thank you to Sandeep Bhai the man behind AudioGeek family and also big thanks to Soundrhyme for providing unit for review tour. Without them this review wouldn't be possible.

Please note my bias towards DD > Hybrids > Planars. Also keep in mind my music choices while reading this review. Find it in music genre section.

I was not paid or offered any kind of compensation for this review. All thoughts and views expressed here are mine.

Now that all pleasantries have been exchanged Let us proceed with meat and potatoes of this review.

Build Quality :

I have received in package a case and IEMS + cable with bunch of eartips. I didn't get any retail package so cant talk about it. Carrying case is made up of leather and is of hard type so it can easily protect IEMs. IEMS shells are made up of aluminum. Shells feel lightweight yet solid inspire confidence in them. Design on the shell surface is eye catching. Cable is terminated with 4.4 mm its not modular. It is 0.78 mm 2 pin type. Both 4.4mm jack and terminations are made up of metal feel premium. Cable separator and chin synch both are also made up of metal. Entire cable feels premium. Set comes with 3 sets of different eartips. Each set has all 4 sizes. Two are normal silicone type while the third one is liquid silicone type. Good accessory pack.

Overall Build Quality 5/5

Comfort :

Shells are not large but medium size so fit issue was not there. People with small ears please check fitting before purchase. Nozzles are medium length so deep fit is possible. Nozzles don't have lips on them yet I had no eartip slip offs. Shells don't feel heavy in ears. Don't create any weird pressure or pain in the ears.

Cable is thick yet it doesn't feel too heavy. It is supple to feel. Doesn't tangle. Has no microphonics. Easy to roadie wrap. Chin synch works. It stays in place.

Summary: Zuri Wilson (Zooble) has just had the SHITTEST day of their life: First the coffee shop they worked at was crowded with customers, the only help they had was a daydreaming, love-struck Agatha (Ragatha), and their boss just sat on her ass making comments instead of helping. They had to walk in the pouring rain to their Uber, deal with a guilt-ridden driver that had ""a disabled cousin that used crutches,"" and then walk up SIX FLIGHT OF STAIRS WITH CRUTCHES to their shitty apartment!

**Why This Pick?**

This is a bold pick – but stay with me. The last 5 straight meetings between these two squads have also fallen North of 233.5 – and while I have a tough time seeing Atlanta putting up enough points to cash this total in their current form, they’ve also won their last 10 straight home games against the Suns. And, to be fair, Atlanta is coming off a road game in which they put 124 points on the board. Phoenix has been an absolute cash cow as of late, and if the Hawks hang around and keep this close the way sports book thinks they will, I don’t doubt this game sees the high 230s. The stats for this pick are overwhelming, friends – I’ve gotta take the Over to cash.

**Origins and Destinies**

_Chapter 3_

***Central Texas 1863, January***

Maddock, Raine and Elbee rode into the lonely little town of Bottom Rung Creek, a former mining town now taken to cattle ranching and farming. Maddock got off his horse, a black and white painted mare he had named Maggie, and looked around. Plenty of “No Irish” signs covered the buildings within the town. Raine and Elbee slid off of Raine’s Clydesdale mare, Sugar Cube, and looked around as well.

“Well isn’t that just typical.” Raine huffed.

“Ranches don’t give a fuck from what I hear.” Maddock said, only the slightest hint of his Irish accent remained. “I’ll ask in the shop.” 

Maddock walked in and noticed a few people look him over before deciding he was best ignored. He saw a board with plenty of signs looking to hire ranch hands. He read them all quickly. Most of them wanted workers for only part of the season and the siblings were looking to make a home for a little bit, so that was out. In the end he hadn’t narrowed anything down when he heard the sound of Raine shouting in anger. He sighed and shook his head, walking outside to see a wide shouldered cowboy sprawled on the ground, Raine standing over him with a busted set of knuckles and Elbee trying his best not to topple over laughing.

“Really? Not even five minutes?” Maddock sighed.

“It’s all right.” A man in a leather jacket said as he walked over, two other men quickly dragged the other man to his feet. “Mr Craig’s been on my boss’ short list for a while now for his behavior.” 

Mr. Craig straightened his jaw out a bit and grunted, “Not broken.” 

“Good, you can ask for jobs the next town over.” The lead cowboy pulled a tin out of his jacket and packed some tobacco into his mouth. “Boss warned you about keepin’ your hands to yerself. Johnny and Mal will take you back to let you pack your things. But your done.” 

Mr. Craig was then forcefully guided away, even though he clearly wanted to lunge forward.

The man smirked and extended his hand to Raine. “Sam Talbot ma’am. I saw it, I can’t believe he was that stupid or that cross was so clean.” 

Maddock smirked as Raine shook the man’s hand.

“Well, wasn't all that clean.” Raine rubbed her knuckles but smiled and Maddock could have sworn he saw her blush a little. “Raine O’Donnelly. This small one is me brother Elbee. The quiet one is my brother Maddock. And Mr. Craig is lucky it weren’t him that had reacted.” 

Sam nodded and then offered his hand to Maddock. Maddock shook the offered hand and noticed how firm the man’s grip was. He returned it and sighed, “Don’t suppose you’re willin’ to hire Irish for Mr. Craig’s position?” 

“Boss married an Irish woman, so it's likely he will.” Sam laughed, “We also need someone to handle and help the Boss’ wife.” He nodded to Raine.

“I can ranch-hand.” Raine said indignantly.

“So can she, she handles one herd, I handle one and the boss handles the third.” Sami smiled, “Meant nothing insultin’ by it.” 

Raine smirked, “Well, I got a temper.” 

“You bloody smilin’ at him?” Elbee looked up. 

“I like funny men.” Raine glared at her brother.

“Explains the week with the clown.” Elbee snickered before Raine pulled him back and away to chide him.

“He seems to be trouble.” Sam chuckled.

“Mountains of it.” Maddock nodded, “But we keep each other level and sane.” 

“Lost family to the famine?” Sam asked.

“Mother died shortly after Elbee was born. Father and us aren’t on speakin’ terms.” Maddock admitted. 

Sam squinted as if trying to piece a puzzle together, but nodded. “Well, Mr. Shue would want to interview you and your sister. Got a school in town and on the Ranch if you stick around more than a season. I gotta get some stuff from the store, you and her want that interview you can follow me out after.” 

Maddock nodded.

Sam was about to leave when he noticed the painted horse was the one Maddock got on. “She rides that monster.” 

“I’ve always been the subtle one, plus she won her in a fight with the previous owner.” Maddock smiled, “We’ll be here when you get done.” 

A moment later Raine and Elbee got back on Sugar Cube.

“So, we got an in?” Raine asked.

“I think.” Maddock nodded, “Mostly to you, but yeah.” 

“Got a school in town.” Elbee looked around, “Could I?” 

Maddock nodded, “We’ll get you in.” 

Elbee smiled.

“How long you think we can stay?” Raine asked, biting her bottom lip.

“Ten years if we’re lucky.” Maddock said, “Four or five if they notice Elbee not growin’ up.” 

“Sorry.” Elbee sighed.

“Out of your hands.” Maddock said, “Don’t worry on it.”

A few minutes later they were following Sam back to the ranch. He was fairly quiet, but explained the ranch was the smallest in the area and had heavy competition from the Triple D Mark Ranch, a large ranch owned by a businessman who hired most of the ranch-hands in the area. The ranch they were going to apply to work at though was called The Lucky Shue Ranch and it was an odd sort of place from the moment they rode onto it.

The first thing that Maddock noticed was that the people working on the ranch were a mish mash of cultures and backgrounds. He spotted former slaves who had clearly run from the war to this out of the way ranch no one was going to track them to. He spotted Irish and Chinese men and women working together to move the herds.

“I hope it don’t offend, though I doubt it does.” Sam laughed, “Lucky Shue is a place fer outcasts and runaways.” 

“It’s like a world away.” Elbee smiled. 

“It does not offend.” Maddock smiled, “I like to think it’s more the way our Lord would want us to be.” 

Sam nodded, “Not much in the way of faith in the carpenter around here, but we don’t judge.” 

Maddock blinked and looked at the obvious Irish men and women, somewhat unwilling to believe that statement, but he also couldn’t argue that he had only recently found his faith once again. He simply nodded in understanding. 

“Mr. and Mrs. Shue will be in the back tending their private garden now.” Sam hitched his horse near a decent sized, but respectable home.  “Come on, Elbee can play around here, plenty of kids to have a lark with.” 

Elbee practically leaped off his sister’s horse and scrambled to the nearest group of kids playing a game of tag.

Maddock smiled and got off his horse, Raine followed and they were both led to the rear of the home through the inside. Maddock noted a lack of pictures or art, but plenty of cooking utensils and gear hung on the walls. Same motioned for both of them to stay just inside the door.

“Boss, Boss Lady. You heard about Mr. Craig.” Sam shouted as he leaned against a pole on the other side of the door leading out.

“I did.” A woman’s crisp Irish accent rang out. “Bao wasn’t too happy, but we did warn him.” 

“He was a good worker, sad he can’t keep his hands to himself.” A man with a higher pitched voice and Chinese accent said.

Maddock followed the voice and saw a man almost half a foot shorter than him with a handlebar mustache on a very Chinese face. He was currently brushing dust out of his eyes. 

“I assume them to be replacements?” Mrs. Shue said.

“Yes’am.” Sam nodded, “Siblings, twins I think. Name of O’Donnelly.” 

Mrs. Shue stopped. “O’Donnelly, eh?” She walked up to the door and peered in, “Well, you look enough like’em. I’m bettin’ he done run you two off?”  

Raine cursed in Irish, “Gach áit mallaithe!”

“Civil tongue here.” Mrs. Shue warned, “Rumor has it there’s a third?” 

“Yes.” Maddock nodded and repeated a lie he always wished were far more true, “He’s barely ten. Couldn’t let him stay with the bastard.”

“He’s got a bounty on information for you three.” Mrs. Shue smiled, “I’d sooner carve my toes off than give him the time of day though. So stay away from the Triple D and you’ll be fine. Bao, come meet our new hands!” 

Bao sprang up and ran to his wife. “Hello, pleasure to meet you. Please don’t be off put by our...” 

Maddock raised his hand. “We’re all just folk as far as I’m concerned, maybe more will join that after the war.”

Bao nodded, “It’s a shame, but we do our part to keep people free of slavery and draconian laws.” 

“These are the O’Donnellys.” Mrs. Shue smiled.

“Liza, really?” Bao sighed, “Are they related?” 

“Very.” Maddock growled, “But we’re as endeared to him as most people.”  Maddock sighed, “If you can believe it he chose his own pride and wealth over his children.” 

Raine just nodded and eyed Sam nervously. 

“Ain’t no concern of mine unless he comes onto this land and tries to make a deal of it.” Sam nodded, “Miss Raine here is the one who laid out Mr. Craig.” 

Liza laughed, “Please my dear, let's get you a drink for that traumatic event.” 

“Won’t turn down a drink!” Raine smiled.

***====Record Scratch====***

“Wait...” Karma pulled the group from the tale back to reality, “That place existed then?” 

“Wasn’t exactly legal for the place, but when you’re half a place’s income you get to make a few rules.” Cardinal laughed.

“And why didn’t your dad come back for you?” Karma asked.

“We’ve wondered that plenty of times.” Raine sighed. “Last time he was keeping people from safety during the Purge war. That settled it for Maddock.” 

“He normally has the advantage over me in fights, his binding being Light and all.” Maddock’s tone was like a cold steel blade. “But you can only push a man so far before he doesn’t care about his own pain. That’s another story though, one I’m not keen on tellin’.” 

“And you just got a job at this place despite them realizing your own father was their competition?” Karma blinked.

“More like it was the reason.” Maddock said with a laugh.

“Our dad has been a dick so long in so many languages and cultures I’m a little surprised he never got to the eastern cultures.” Elbee snorted.

“1980’s Japan.” Spaz said, “We tracked him there as part of the rise of electronics. He had a bid for purchasing a company blocked by multiple other national companies.” 

Karma nodded, “Wow.” 

“Dwayne O’Donnelly is the Bastard.” Raine hissed, “I’d sooner carve off my toes than actually talk to him again.” 

Karma blinked. 

“Mrs. Shue had the best phrases.” Raine sniffed.

“So what’s the third D?” Karma asked. ""In the Triple D? I assume two were his names.""

“Diana.” Maddock smirked, “Our Mother’s name. But fuck him for ever usin’ it.” 

Karma blinked and watched the anger immediately deflate from Maddock.

“So...” Elbee got back to the story. “We stuck around for a bit.”

***===Record Un-scratch====***

The first month the siblings stayed, they found Maddock quickly earning a place among Sheriff Lattimer’s typically called upon posse, and a place among the people as a locator of lost objects. But it was a cold day in March that cemented the desire of the three to stay.

“Sunrise is nice.” Raine watched the sun in the distance on the flatlands as she sat on the railing of a wooden fence of the house they had been renting.

“It is.” Maddock was winding a rope around his arm. “Sheriff is askin’ me to track a few of the Indians. Wants to do some talkin’.”

“You trust him?” Raine asked. “He always seems to be leering at us.” 

“He can’t make heads or tails of us. Not your typical Irish and all, plus I think he might suspect.” Maddock sighed, “That ain’t true, he definitely knows, but he doesn’t let it darken his opinion of us.” 

“Well, I mean the name gives it away.” Raine snorted as she held her mug of coffee.

“No. He’s like us. I’ve felt it around him. His stare. He’s like Card, called to it.” Maddock sighed, “Blessed.” 

“Lucky bastard.” Rainer blew her hair out of her eyes. “He say anything?” 

Maddock shook his head, “Just that he trusts me.” Maddock looked to the ground. “Ain’t heard that in too damn long from someone new.”

“You wanna stay now.” Raine laughed, “Found a friend.” 

“Oh, like you don’t.” Maddock shot back, “I haven’t counted, but I could, see how many times you’re sneakin’ back in after midnight.” 

“And tarnish your sister’s reputation?” Raine played at being offended.

“You love your reputation as a violent floozy.” Maddock laughed.

Raine laughed, “I do, and Sam does too.” She looked at her drink, “I think he’s gonna propose.” 

“That would be somethin’.” Maddock nodded. “What would you say?” 

Raine put the mug on the fence and shook her head. “I don’t know. What could I tell’em? I’m sorry Sammy-boy, _Ní féidir liom páistí a bheith agam!_”

“English.” Elbee said as he walked out. “You two finally feeling at home?” 

“Aye.” Maddock sighed “And all the guilt and worry that comes with it.” 

“Don’t worry too much, something will come and up-root us.” Elbee kicked the dirt and tossed a knife at the fence driving the blade deep into the wood. “It always does. We can’t have happy.” 

Maddock paused then took a breath. “You may be right. But we got a right to it, god-damnit.”

“Maddie?” Elbee looked up.

“You want to learn, you got a school here so you learn. We’ll get Lattimer to help cover it up. He’s like us, and he likes us.” Maddock tossed the rope down and climbed over the fence in a bound. “You figure out what color dress you’re gonna wear.” 

“I am not wearin’ a dress.” Raine scoffed, “Rip too damn easy, but I am wearin’ white!” 

“He won’t care if you can’t have kids, and God willin’ he won’t judge us for bein’ cursed.” Maddock sighed, “But this is an honest chance to try.” 

“He’s right.” Raine smiled, “Maybe, might wear a dress.” She slightly blushed.

“We can find one like mother’s.” Elbee smiled, “I know it’s really out of style...” 

“Elbee, it’d get us made in a hot minute and a half.” Raine laughed.

Maddock walked to his horse and got on. “I’m goin’ to talk to Lattimer. Pray for me, yeah?” 

Elbee rolled his eyes, but Raine slowly nodded.

“He’s listenin’ Raine. He’ll see us through.” Maddock clicked and rode Maggie to the small town of Bottom Rung Creek.

When he rode into town, the sun was high in the sky and the Sheriff's office was just opening. Maddock quickly approached the clay building and knocked on the front door.

“Come on in O’Donnelly.” The old voice of Sheriff Lattimer called. 

Maddock walked in and Maxim Lattimer was sitting at his desk leaned back with his boots propped up. His ole wrinkled face had a smile on it and his salt and pepper hair was neatly combed back on his thin head. He gestured to one of his chairs. 

“Come to discuss the tracking job?” Lattimer asked.

“And for some assistance.” Maddock said, “Of a unique nature.” 

Lattimer was about to light a cigarette when he shouted out, “Denny!” 

A tall man with a shirt half on shot up in the holding cell. “Yeah boss!” 

“You got drunk last night. Now go home and sleep the rest off, I got stuff to talk with O’Donnelly.” Lattimer tossed the man a set of keys.

Denny caught them and stood up. “Mornin’ Maddock.” He walked over and let himself out. “You missed a heck of a party last night. That sister of yours put down some fur trappers and made’em blush...” He stopped when Lattimer’s gaze fell on him. “She does us all proud here.” He slipped out and hung the keys on the Sheriff’s desk.  

“Poachers.” Lattimer said, “Kind we need to talk about the local tribes about.” 

“Who do we have out here?” Maddock asked, “I ain’t seen any.” 

“Apache and Comanche and I think some Chocktaw.” Lattimer lit his cigarette. “Mostly concerned with the Apache. “You know the languages at all?” 

Maddock shook his head. “Last time I came farther out west there was Pilgrims about and I ran right back to Europe.” 

Lattimer laughed, “I came a century later. Haven’t left since, this land is good to those who treat it right, hence why I want friendly neighbors. I can do the talkin’ if you can find them.” 

Maddock nodded, “People aren’t hard to find, it’s the problems that come with them that worries me.” 

Lattimer nodded to Maddock’s gloves, “People assume you been burnt.” 

Maddock wrung his hands, “Wish it were that simple, I pick up evil, see people’s dying sights and I hunt their tormenters.” 

“Well I’ll be.” Lattimer laughed, “The Family themselves, I’d been wondering.” 

Maddock tilted his head.

“Call you lot the Family of Wrath.” Lattimer smiled. “Far more entertaining than the Forgotten Centurion.” Lattimer roared with laughter.

“Centurion?” Maddock blinked, “What is yours?”

Lattimer blinked in confusion.

“Mine is vengeance.” Maddock explained.

“I am Law. I want to say Jupiter charged me when Rome fell, but that wasn’t Jupiter. It was older. I figure Zeus.” Lattimer sighed, “Keep the lands civilized. What’re the others?” 

“Raine is rage, Elbee is Fear.” Maddock sighed, “All of us thralls and we have no guidance save for some friends that try desperately to keep us together.” 

“Where are they, I wonder?” Lattimer asked.

“I told them we needed space. They’ll find us when it matters. Or we’ll go back to them.” Maddock gave a weak smile, “But I think that's brought us full circle now.” 

Lattimer nodded, “Want to be able to lie low, yeah? I can help, you and your sister will be easy exceptin’ for Sam plannin’ to want to marry her. Elbee might be harder but we can work with people and if you can get Sam and his bosses in on it all, well then you’re set.” 

“Would you trust them?” Maddock asked.

“I trust a lot of people, some I shouldn’t.” Lattimer laughed, “I’ve learned if you worry about this nature of ours too much and what people will think, well then you’ll never get anywhere.” 

Maddock nodded, “I’ll help, of course...” He paused, “Were you there?” He pulled out his crucifix.

Lattimer laughed, “Gods above, no. I ain’t that old. But I know he was real. I’ve seen one of them fallen ones.” 

Maddock stared in awe. “You have to tell me.” 

Lattimer laughed, “Maybe on the trails when finding the Apache. Think you can be ready in a day or two?” 

Maddock nodded, “Shouldn’t be too hard, everyone thinks the shadows hide them, but not from me.” 

“I’m gonna remember that.” Lattimer nodded, “If you or Raine need some gardenin’ help you let me know.” 

Maddock nodded and went back to Maggie as a large smile broke out on his face. Then he went to ride home again to share the good news. They had a home.

As I want to go from a bean to cup machine to something more serious, I spent hours to pre-select several machines.

I understood, through my lectures here, that the grinder of the Barista Express Intens is not good enough for such a machine.

Therefore, I was almost decided to go for the Bambino Plus. And purchase, later on, a grinder. In between I would purchase grinded coffee in a shop selling fresh coffee.

However, nowadays in France, the Barista Express Impress is almost at the same price than the Bambino Plus (550€ versus 700€). Indeed the first is on sale, the second full price. Said differently, I feel I would almost no pay for the bad grinder of the 2-in-1, that would constitute a kind of ""free bonus"".

In such a situation, what would you do ?

As side comments:
- I love the barometer on the Barista Express Intens, and the fact I can prepare an espresso with one hand thanks to it's weight.
- Coffee-wise, if you use the same coffee grinded by a high-end grider, do both machines make same quality espresso ?

1qkxtav,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastroparesis/comments/1qkxtav/high_fat_diet/,high fat diet?,"**anyone here on high fat diet, low protein?**

===  
i'm with gastroparesis a long time, and really have problems with carbs and overall my mental health struggle , the same with hormonal health when i'm low fat.

*low fat:*  
\- mental health problems  
\-small amount of calories, loosing weight  
\- hormonal problems  
\- constant flare up from any random goods... some day it could be peeled cucumber, someday you are good with cucumber, whatever, just random sht

  
  
**after all years (8 years, i have it from 17 yo)**  
**what's really working for me:**

i do 2 intakes of fish 150gr/2 or crustaceans as they are more nutritios.  
and 140gr of ghee 

  
**first intake**  in blender  
salmon 75 gr/oysters/shrimps/crambs  
75 gr of ghee 

**second intake** in blender (in 4 hours after first intake)  
salmon 75 gr/oysters/shrimps/crambs  
75 gr of ghee 

**i do cup of coffee (small cup) each 4 hours as hydration, as water my biggest trigger**  
**coke diet helped me before, but last few month i have aspartame intolerance ...**

as i gotta in ketosis(i have 4-6)  
\- i do not have any cravings  
\- i feel so good mentally  
\- i feel so good hormonally  
\- i do not loose weight so much because it is 1450 ccal daily  


i do not have vomiting with this diet, if i do exactly ghee but i have little reaction with butter, especially bad quality of butter, and less reaction with grass fed butter and  unfortunately instant vomit from olive oil

it's still difficult for me to eat chicken, red meat.

i do cup of coffee (small cup) each 4 hours as hydration, as water my biggest trigger

so...

===

any experience with high fat/carnivore diet here?  
i believe ketosis can help us too, because all this sht is so difficult on my mental health especially during flare ups...

1qkxt86,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1qkxt86/tired_of_the_blowups/,Tired of the blowups,"Today has already had two small blowups. The first one was, while I was talking, he saw the baby move on the baby monitor.  Mind you, the baby is asleep and their own nursery with a noisemaker on. The baby moving was purely coincidental, as I was not talking loudly. He instantly got irritated and accused me of waking the baby up. The baby had simply moved and ended up sleeping for another hour. Once we realized the baby was asleep still, I asked for an apology and he gave one of those typical narcissistic, I’m going to apologize, but I don’t mean it, apologies. When I started getting angry, and showing how I really felt, I forced him to give me an apology and he could barely do it. He was so angry. He called me a name, I called him a name. I told him there’s no reason to constantly monitor how loud I talk. I reminded him that just yesterday he was screaming at me when the baby was asleep and didn’t care how loud he was talking so why does he care how loud I was talking. He corrected me and told me that wasn’t yesterday it was the day before…. As if that matters. 😤

\-in early December, he switched phone companies again. Usually I’m the one that has to deal with all the residual bills and bullshit that goes along with switching phone companies. I asked him to deal with the bill today, as he sees me on the phone doing all kinds of things while he’s scrolling and sipping coffee. He asked me to do it, as he’s doing nothing and I’ve been handling things all morning at this point.  I remind him that he promised me he would handle the bill if we switched phone companies. He pipes up and says “no I didn’t tell you I would do that for this bill. I said I would do it for the other phone company” which, technically he is correct. I was wrong about that. However, why do I have to do everything like this in the house? Anyway, he’s calling the phone company and getting super irritated. I’m still having to tell him how to do it. He has to hang up and call back and I’m telling him to ask for an agent. He starts getting so mad all because he has to call a phone company. He grints his teeth and says  “fucking bitches” as he is trying to get a rep . He finally gets someone on the line, as i’ve helped him do it. Then when Agent gets on the phone, he instantly tries to hand the phone to me!

Then, he gets a job offer, which does require 12 hour days in the factory with about three hours of driving total. However, he is a union worker, so hours can be very variable. With the overtime included, this job pays $175,000 a year. Again, this is for blue-collar work. He says he will take it, but that once it starts on overnight shifts, he’s going to quit because he’s not doing overnights. I’m not sure if overnights start in one week or one month, but I don’t understand. I have a college degree, and when the money followed me to do overnights, I did them. You would think after all of the poor financial decisions he’s made, the times that he’s ruined my credit in the past, he would want to do this, even if it’s for one year.

I don’t know how much longer I can do this.",1,1769190925.0,NarcissisticSpouses,0,1.0,False

1qkxswh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestTriathletes/comments/1qkxswh/whats_the_real_superpower_of_triathlon_spoiler/,What's the REAL Superpower of Triathlon? Spoiler: It's Not the Fitness.,"Hey everyone,

Let's talk about the secret sauce of our sport. We all know the grind: the 5 AM alarms, the endless laps, the saddle sores, the ""why am I doing this?"" moments mid run. But what truly keeps us coming back, season after season, race after race? It's not just the finish line photo.

It's the community. And this isn't just a feel good statement, it's proven by science and some pretty incredible data.

**The Data-Driven Magic of The Team**  
We often think of triathlon as the ultimate solo challenge, but the magic happens when it becomes a shared journey.

* **The ""Motivation Gain Effect"":** Research has shown that athletes training in a group setting work up to 200% harder when exercising alongside others they perceive as stronger. Your training partners aren't just company; they're your secret performance weapon.
* **The Commitment Multiplier:** Data indicates that 51% of triathlon club members are more likely to sign up for a race if their teammates are also participating. The community literally gets us to the start line.
* **Economic & Social Ripple:** Thriving clubs create local ""triathlon economic ecosystems,"" supporting bike shops, coffee spots, and physios. More importantly, organizations like TriLatino and Achilles International are using this community framework to break down historic barriers around diversity, cost, and ability, making our sport richer and more inclusive.

In short, the right community transforms a painful, solitary pursuit into a powerful, shared experience where everyone performs better and finds more meaning.

This all leads me to a few questions for you, The ""influencer"" vs ""authentic athlete"" debate is alive in our sport, and everyone's community experience is different.

1. What's the **one thing** your triathlon community (club, online forum, training group) has given you that you couldn't have gotten training completely alone? Was it knowledge, accountability, that 200% effort boost, or pure friendship?
2. There's a lot of content out there. What separates a **truly valuable triathlon influencer/community leader** from someone who's just creating noise? Is it proven results, relatable struggle, educational value, or a focus on inclusivity?
3. Has triathlon **changed** more for you than just your fitness? Have you witnessed or experienced a transformation in yourself or a teammate that went beyond swim, bike, run?

Let's share what makes this sport truly exceptional. The stats are cool, but your stories are everything.

I don’t know if this is right sub to ask but i am ask anyway

I’m posting this here because my overthinking is winning and I’d regret it if I didn’t at least try.

I recently finished up some work at Sanocito Therapeutics Inc. in Solan. While I was there, I met a girl who really caught my attention. I have pretty bad social anxiety, so I was struggling to find a way to say hello or strike up a conversation.

To my surprise, she actually came up to me and started a conversation. She noticed I looked like I might be from the South, and we talked a bit about my family and whether I preferred living in the North or the South.

At the time, I was so caught up in my head that I just answered her questions. I had didn't ask for her number, and I didn't do anything to keep the conversation going. Now that my work there is finished, I realized I probably won't have a reason to head back that way anytime soon.

If you happen to work there and this sounds like you—or if you know who I’m talking about—I’d love the chance to actually be the one to ask the questions this time. I’d love to grab a coffee or just say thanks for being so welcoming when I was clearly nervous.",1,1769190802.0,HimachalPradesh,1,1.0,False
1qkxqb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedlnMen/comments/1qkxqb6/how_to_be_the_most_charming_person_in_the_room/,How to Be the Most Charming Person in the Room: The Psychology That Actually Works,"I used to think charm was something you either had or didn't. Like charisma was this mysterious gift handed out at birth to a lucky few. Then I started actually studying it, diving into research on social psychology, body language, conversation dynamics. Turns out? Charm isn't magic. It's a skill set. And most people get it completely wrong.

The common advice is garbage. ""Just smile more."" ""Be confident."" Cool, thanks. Super helpful. What actually works is way more nuanced and honestly, way more interesting. I've pulled together insights from books, podcasts, research studies, and real observations of genuinely magnetic people. Here's what actually moves the needle.

The paradox: charm isn't about being interesting, it's about being interested

Most people walk into rooms thinking ""how do I seem cool?"" Wrong question. Charming people ask ""how do I make others feel interesting?"" This comes straight from research in social psychology. When you make someone feel heard and valued, their brain lights up. They associate that good feeling with YOU.

* **Ask follow up questions that show you actually listened.** Not generic ones. If someone mentions they're from Portland, don't just nod. Ask what neighborhood, what they miss most, if they're a coffee snob now. Specificity signals genuine interest.
* **Use their name naturally in conversation.** Studies show hearing our own name activates the brain's reward centers. Just don't overdo it and sound like a used car salesman.
* **Master the ""callback"".** Reference something they mentioned earlier in the conversation. ""Wait, didn't you say your sister does that too?"" It shows you're mentally present, not just waiting for your turn to talk.

The book [*Captivate: The Science of Succeeding with People*](https://www.amazon.com/Captivate-Science-Succeeding-People-Vanessa/dp/0399563091) by Vanessa Van Edwards breaks this down beautifully. She's a behavioral investigator who's studied thousands of social interactions. The research is solid, the writing is fun, and honestly? This book will make you question everything you think you know about first impressions. Best practical guide on human interaction I've found. She shows how tiny tweaks in body language and conversation create massive ripple effects.

Vulnerability beats perfection every single time

Here's what nobody tells you: people don't trust perfect. Perfect feels fake, performed, exhausting. Charming people share small imperfections early. They admit they're directionally challenged or that they burn everything they cook. It disarms people.

* **Share minor struggles, not just wins.** Talked about your promotion? Cool. Also mention you spilled coffee on yourself this morning. Balance is key.
* **Laugh at yourself before others can.** Self deprecating humor (when not overdone) is magnetic because it shows confidence. You're secure enough to not take yourself too seriously.
* **Admit when you don't know something.** ""I have no idea about that, tell me more"" is infinitely more charming than pretending expertise.

I found this concept deep in [*The Charisma Myth*](https://www.amazon.com/Charisma-Myth-Science-Ordinary-Extraordinary/dp/B00DSXHKLU) by Olivia Fox Cabane. She's coached everyone from Stanford students to Fortune 500 execs. The book demolishes the idea that charisma is innate. She breaks down presence, power, and warmth into actual techniques you can practice. Fair warning though, it'll make you hyper aware of how often you fake listening in conversations. Worth it.

Energy management is everything

You know that person who somehow makes every room feel lighter? They're not naturally ""high energy."" They're managing their energy intelligently. Big difference.

* **Match then slightly elevate.** If someone's mellow, don't come in like a tornado. Meet their energy level first, then bring it up just a notch. They'll follow.
* **Watch your body language for ""closed"" signals.** Crossed arms, looking at your phone, angling away from people. These kill charm instantly. Open posture, full body facing the person, phone away. Basic but most people fail at this.
* **Use strategic pauses.** Charming people don't fill every silence. They let moments breathe. It creates anticipation and shows you're comfortable with yourself.

The [*On Being*](https://onbeing.org/programs/on-being-podcast/) podcast with Krista Tippett completely changed how I think about presence in conversation. She interviews everyone from poets to scientists, and the way she creates space for people to think and respond? That's charm in its purest form. Listen to literally any episode and you'll pick up on how powerful intentional pausing can be.

Storytelling over facts

Nobody remembers the specifics of what you said. They remember how you made them feel. Stories create feelings. Facts don't.

* **Structure: setup, conflict, resolution.** Even tiny stories need this. ""I went to this coffee shop"" becomes ""I wandered into this sketchy looking cafe, almost left, but the owner convinced me to try this insane lavender latte and now I'm obsessed.""
* **Include sensory details.** Not ""it was nice"" but ""the place smelled like burnt sugar and old books."" Details make stories sticky.
* **Know when to stop.** Charming people edit ruthlessly. They cut the boring parts and land the punchline before attention wanders.

[*Storyworthy*](https://www.amazon.com/Storyworthy-Engage-Persuade-Teach-Inspire/dp/0374248222) by Matthew Dicks is INSANELY good for this. He's a storytelling champion (yes that's a real thing) and teacher. The book teaches you to find compelling moments in everyday life and share them in ways that captivate people. Fair warning, you'll start seeing stories everywhere once you read this. Your brain will rewire.

For anyone wanting to go deeper without burning through dozens of books, there's a smart learning app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from all these sources, books, research papers, expert insights on communication and social psychology, and creates personalized audio learning plans.

Built by a team from Columbia and former Google experts, it lets you set specific goals like ""become more magnetic in social settings as an introvert"" and generates adaptive learning plans with podcasts tailored to your unique challenges. You can adjust the depth from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples and context. The voice options are genuinely addictive, think smoky, sarcastic tones that make learning feel less like work. It also has a virtual coach you can chat with about your specific social struggles, and it recommends content based on what clicks for you. Makes structured self-improvement way easier to stick with.

Presence trumps polish

The most charming people I've met aren't the smoothest talkers. They're the most PRESENT. Their attention doesn't drift mid conversation. Their eyes don't glaze over. They're fully there.

* **Put your phone on silent and out of sight.** Not face down on the table. AWAY. Every glance at it signals ""something else might be more important than you.""
* **Practice active listening.** Nod at actual interesting points, not just reflexively. React genuinely. ""Wait, seriously?"" ""That's wild."" ""How did that feel?""
* **Notice people's micro expressions.** Did their face light up when they mentioned something? Did they tense at a topic? Charming people read these cues and adjust accordingly.

Research from Harvard Business School shows that people who put away devices during conversations are perceived as more trustworthy, competent, and yes, more charming. The data is clear. Attention is the ultimate luxury you can give someone.

Charm isn't about becoming someone else. It's about becoming more intentionally yourself. The version that's curious, present, and genuinely interested in others. Start with one thing from this list. Maybe it's asking better follow ups, maybe it's sharing one small vulnerability. Practice it until it feels natural, then add another.

You're not faking charm. You're removing the barriers that were blocking it all along.",1,1769190751.0,LockedlnMen,0,1.0,False

From pretty early on we combined most things. One joint account for bills groceries trips and then we each kept a small personal account. It worked fine at first and felt very adult and stable.



Lately Ive been feeling anxious every time I open the banking app. Not because we are broke but because I feel watched in a way I cant fully explain. If I buy something random like a book or takeout on a bad day he never yells or anything but he always notices. He will say stuff like oh we got coffee twice this week or didnt you just order something yesterday. Its not aggressive just constant.



I realized I miss the feeling of spending my own money without having to mentally justify it. So last week I brought it up. I said I wanted to go back to fully separate finances and just split bills manually. I tried to frame it as something I needed for my own peace not a criticism of him.



He did not take it well. He said it felt like I was pulling away or planning an exit. He asked if I didnt trust him anymore. I was surprised because trust wasnt what this was about for me. It was more about autonomy and not feeling quietly judged.



Since that talk things have been tense. He keeps saying its fine but I can tell hes hurt. Part of me feels guilty like I broke some unspoken relationship milestone rule. Another part of me feels relief just thinking about having my own space again even financially.



Now Im stuck wondering if I created a problem where there wasnt one. Was this something I should have just dealt with internally or is it reasonable to want that separation even in a serious relationship.

**What is time-gating?**

Let's not walk over muddy terrain and settle definitions. Time-gating can take different forms and there's a blurry line between what's considered time-gated and not. Truth is, everything is time-gated to some degree, but clearly, we don't consider the wait for your iron ore to smelt a time gate; unless it takes hours.

* In-game time-gating: some process that depends solely on in-game actions takes a huge amount of time to complete, on the scale of hours, days, even weeks. A great example is [Clash of Clans](https://supercell.com/en/games/clashofclans/).
   * Present time-gating: time only passes when in-game.
   * Away time-gating: time still passes while you're outside the game.
* Real-time time-gating: somethings occurs in game after a specific moment in real time, either dependent on local or global time systems. Global shops that reset after a specific UTC time are an example. On the other hand, daily quests can sometimes base the countdown on the time you claim them, in such case, they would classify as the first type.
* Real-time syncing: time in a game is tied to real time in some way. [Animal Crossing](https://animalcrossing.nintendo.com/) is a prime example, where in-game time represents the actual real time. A more subtle example is how [Minecraft has special occurrences that happen during holidays](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Easter_eggs#Christmas).

**Why these?**

Most reasons may easily be crossed as evil by people, let's try better, [this is not a place to discuss ethics](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/o5iop1/retired_thread_megathread_microtransactions_are/). I warn you that I may be biased; I'm a game developer myself, and time-gating is often done because of resources. However, remember the title of the post.

Some of the most common sightings of time-gating are in the kind of games mentioned at the top of the post:

* Mobile games usually have away in-game time-gating because that's a proven and profitable monetization strategy. Who hasn't watched an ad to skip things?
* MMOs do both in-game and real-time time-gating to ""level out"" their playerbase and prevent progress/skill gaps between them.
* Gachas and F2Ps use all kinds of time-gating to artificially expand the time their game is played and increase the chances of someone spending money in these games.
* Games with profitable and engaging season passes are a form of real-time time-gating.
* Cozy games become more cozy (allegedly) by being tied to real-time. We could rephrase it as games can become more immersive by being tied to real-time.

As you see, there's lots of uses and reasons for time-gating and that's not to mention the common one, that all of these share in some way: time-gating gives developers more time to resources to work with, one way or another:

* For live service games in which content is a constant, time-gating things offers fine control to the developers to know when will people run out of content to expand upon it
* Recurrence has all sort of consequences that make people more prone to spend money in the game
* Inflated amounts of playtime somehow increase the perceived value of a game and make it more valuable...

**Let's get passionate**

As a developer, all the above feels necessary,

as a player, all the above feels unnecessary,

as a designer, all the above needs change.

Time-gating is usually explored in just a handful of games because of need. The rare instances in which it is included as a design feature that tries to mold the game, are those seen in games like [Cozy Grove](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458100/Cozy_Grove/). The game is a paid one with no other monetization strategy. Time-gating even comes as a notice on its Steam page. It's purely a design feature, with a motivation that I think is summarized in this commentary by u/EmberDarkly:

>I played this game every morning while I was waking up and drinking my coffee. I really appreciated the limited stuff to do every day because when I was done with everything I could put it down and start my day in the real world. It was a cozy, stress free start to my day. If I play a different game first thing in the morning I will not get a single other thing done all day

We are not allowed nor should we discuss gaming addictions here. However, this is not about addiction but an understandable side effect of entertaining games. Games are designed to hack our attention circuitry, we even praise games that do so efficiently. That, inevitably puts us on disadvantage no matter how healthy our relationship with games is and it makes it possible for us to break out of control every once in a while.

To put it better. I don't think it's a matter of how much you're actually spending or not spending your time. It's about how you feel about it. And how we feel about games is important to the gaming experience. There are studies that actually point at a change in our perception of time after gaming.

[https://cyberpsychology.eu/article/view/4221](https://cyberpsychology.eu/article/view/4221)

>A person who is completely absorbed in performing an activity might reach a state of flow, a mental condition that is marked among other characteristics by a distorted sense of time (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990)

Also, regarding the nature of this discussion and it's focus on design, not addiction mitigation (which is also of my concern but not appropriate here):

>nor does time loss offer much diagnostic value for video game addiction as time loss is reported by high- and low frequency players alike (Wood & Griffiths, 2007; Wood et al., 2007)

Anyone, can loose track of time. Just as anyone can play and enjoy games :D

As such, I deem it convenient to think of time-gating as an accessibility feature and even design element (we'll later see how) more than a malevolent strategy. Tutorials teaching you, cutscenes deviating your attention or pacing changes to give your mind a break do all affect game design and simultaneously improve accessibility, which is also extrapolated to wellbeing on a side note.

**It has to be done right**

All of what I've said until now, does not mean that the current implementation of this feature in examples given is flawless. Indeed, it's far from perfect. In my opinion, just in my opinion, all of the implementation examples mentioned in ***Why these?*** are not right.

To me, Cozy Grove's implementation is on great tracks, but still not considerate enough. On top of the mentioned real-time time syncing the game has, I should also mention it has a kind of time-gating in which you just get a certain amount of tasks to do every day and then have to wait. Without getting into the details about the game's design and if activities are or not entertaining, let's focus merely on time-gating and why I think it's not perfectly executed.

  
*From this review:* [*https://steamcommunity.com/id/MyPublicProfile/recommended/1458100/*](https://steamcommunity.com/id/MyPublicProfile/recommended/1458100/)

>don't always have the same amount of time - I may have 4 spare hours today, and I would like to play the game for these hours. But it soon blocks all means of progress and literally tells me to come back tomorrow. But I may not have time tomorrow, or the day after, I have time today.

I am privileged to be able to play daily, for now. But there's people that not. I have friends that will only connect during the weekends because that's when they have got time and they sure want to play how much they can during that limited time frame. The daily time-gating done by games like Cozy Grove are not friendly to these players and makes them completely dislike time-gated games.

The solution in my head is just making cumulative additions. Whatever it is that you're locking behind time, make it so that it accumulated with time. If you handle in daily quests, make it so that after a week off, you've got to choose from all the quests you've been accumulating throughout the week. Oh wait, someone already does it? Yeah, that's right, [Deep Rock Galactic](https://www.deeprockgalactic.com/) with its season passes. Which also solves another issue for free:

>Monthly or weekly time gated is fine, but when the Dev make it daily, it turns game into a job where you cannot be late for work (Ex: you missed the 7pm Red Dragon, too bad).

\- u/scaur

**It's better!**

>It's a therapeutic retreat that reminds you to slow down, appreciate the little things, and find joy in quiet moments.

That's what someone said about Cozy Grove in this review [https://steamcommunity.com/id/kaddyruf/recommended/1458100/](https://steamcommunity.com/id/kaddyruf/recommended/1458100/)

Maybe they just said it because of the cozy. But this is a sentiment you can find in lots of games that are short, like [A Short Hike](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1055540/A_Short_Hike/). Check this review: [*https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198256363210/recommended/1055540/*](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198256363210/recommended/1055540/)

>Game takes 1 hour to beat  
I have 32 hours

While it isn't exactly a time-gated game, it shares a similarity with my ideal of time-gating and that is that of playing the game less and enjoying it more. As I said, time-gating for me is a feature with the potential to meaningfully impact the design of the game, not just inflate hours of playtime. A Short Hike just results to be a short game so it's easily digested. What about big games that are more dense? It's easy to think that, in excess, these games will be harder to assimilate. That's why they roll out things slowly, but that's still not enough when people keep churning through it. The brain needs to sleep eventually to process what it has seen.

I've played all of [Jury Trial](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1389140/Jury_Trial/) in one sitting. It's an extremely dense and mentally engaging game that will leave you exhausted. You need pauses, you have to split your experience in multiple days, there's no better way of enjoying it. Sure, I made the right decisions and got to complete and enjoy the game. But I acknowledge it would have been much more enjoyable if I decided to split it across weeks.

**Summary**

Where I'm trying to get is, to the beginning. It's not about spending more or less time, which sure is also cause for concern, but about how it feels. How the game changes when you enjoy it more slowly, split across multiple days and most importantly, knowing what you've gone through.

Part of the magic of growing a plant, a pet, a kid, a friendship, relationship, project, anything... Is knowing what you've gone through.

I think time-gating, specially for the videogames of future, since they are becoming more open, expansive and long term than ever, is a great choice to foster meaning.

* I don't need to spend more time aimlessly playing an in-game present time-gated game.
* I don't want games to lure me into spending money through inflated wait times.
* I don't need games to be bound to real time, I don't always have the availability for time.
* I want games that ensure me it'll feel better tomorrow, next week, next month, whenever we see again.

And to me, that is done through meticulously crafted real-time time gating with cumulative additions to the game. I could go on about how this relates to a better development process, improved wellbeing, linearity in games and the need for some of them to end... But we'll let it here

**TL:DR; Slowly rolling out content of a game as real time passes, while away of the game and without enforcing any specific schedule, may improve the experience of the game by changing how things are perceived, ensuring ideas are assimilated and shaping the intimate relationship with the game.**",0,1769190171.0,truegaming,0,0.5,False
1qkxg3z,https://v.redd.it/xjo8p1bjy4fg1,Urine is bubbly but Medical labs are normal,"I had taken medical check up from two different hospitals, and both laboratories and doctors told me I'm perfectly healthy.

I was given ultrasound, blood tests, and urine tests.

My fasting blood sugar is 88, my creatinine is 0.9. My urine tests showed normal readings. And ultrasound all showed my pancreas, liver, kidney, prostate, bladder and gall bladder as normal.

However I can't help but be paranoid that my urine is bubbly. Sometimes it even sounds like a soda poured on a glass of water. 80% of bubbles dissipate within 3-5 minutes.

PS: on the second ultrasound, they saw 1-2mm kdney stone but as per the doctor for people who eat a lot of leafy vegetables, this is normal and it eventually flushes out. To help the flushing out faster, he gave me effervescent to take for 5 days. And these stones aren't the one causing the foam in urine.

They found 4mm-5mm polyp in gall bladder but as per doctor a large majority of people have small polyps in their gall bladdder that they are unware because these things only appear on ultrasound. These are benign and never cause any problem.

In the end, he think that the foam of my urine is from my diet, because all my tests are of a very healthy individual so he said not to panic.

My diet is only coffee 3 times a day, tea before bed, leafy veggies 3-4 times a week, and regular 30 mins exercise.

I’m 23F, living in a very rural town with not many job opportunities.

I graduated during summer last year and got my RN license in August 2025. I don’t have any prior healthcare experience or much job experience besides working as a cashier at a grocery store and barista at a coffee shop for years, and I didn’t really get a thorough interviewer and was hired on the spot for both jobs. 

I’ve sent out many applications to hospitals nearby and haven’t gotten response. So I’ve been jobless for about five months now, which has been very discouraging.

I should have been a CNA or worked as a PCT during nursing school, but I was struggling trying to keep my grades up and during the summer time I missed out on the externships and deeply regret it. 

My anxiety is really getting to me. I feel like I’m starting to lose my knowledge and skills that I learned in school since I haven’t been working in almost half a year. I’m also fearing that my anxiety may mess me up during an interview if I ever get one.

Problem is, it directly abuts a creek. Like, open a window, pour out a coffee cup, and you get a phone call from the DNR.

We ate some in the car since I really was starving, and then he drove me home after making sure I was warm enough under an electric blanket.

February is one of the best months to travel in India, offering pleasant weather, vibrant festivals, and comfortable conditions for sightseeing across most regions. As winter slowly fades and summer has not yet begun, travellers can explore India’s diverse landscapes—from snow-capped mountains to sun-kissed beaches—without extreme temperatures. Whether you are a cultural explorer, nature lover, foodie, or road-trip enthusiast, India in February delivers an unforgettable experience.

# Preparation to Travel Before Visiting India

Before visiting India, proper preparation is essential to ensure a smooth and enjoyable journey. The first step is securing a valid visa, which can be easily obtained through India’s e-Visa system for most international travellers. It is advisable to book accommodations and domestic transport in advance, especially if you plan to visit popular destinations or attend festivals. Travelers should also check recommended vaccinations, carry basic medicines, and arrange comprehensive travel insurance. If you plan to drive in India, obtaining an [**International Driving License India**](https://e-itca.org/international-driving-license-india/) (International Driving Permit) in your home country is strongly recommended, as it allows legal driving and smooth vehicle rental across Indian states. Packing should include light winter clothing for evenings, comfortable walking shoes, sun protection, and respectful attire for religious places.

# First Things to Do After You Visit India

Once you arrive in India, the first things to do include purchasing a local SIM card or activating international roaming to stay connected. Exchanging currency at authorized counters or using international debit/credit cards ensures easy payments, although carrying some cash is useful in local markets. Understanding basic local customs, greetings, and traffic rules helps travelers adapt quickly. Registering with your country’s embassy, downloading navigation and travel apps, and confirming hotel transfers are smart early steps that make your stay safe and stress-free.

# Best Places to Visit in India in February

February is ideal for exploring North India, South India, deserts, and hill stations alike. Rajasthan shines during this month, with Jaipur, Udaipur, Jaisalmer, and Jodhpur offering royal palaces, desert safaris, and cultural events under clear skies. In North India, Agra and Delhi are perfect for historical sightseeing, while Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand attract snow lovers to destinations like Manali, Shimla, Auli, and Mussoorie. South India enjoys dry and pleasant weather, making Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Goa excellent choices for beaches, backwaters, temples, and wildlife sanctuaries. February is also a great time to visit the Northeast, including Assam and Meghalaya, for scenic beauty and cultural richness.

# Festivals in India During February and March

India comes alive with festivals in February and March, offering travelers a deep cultural experience. In February, the **Taj Mahotsav** in Agra celebrates Indian arts, crafts, and music, while the **Goa Carnival** fills the streets with colorful parades and performances. The **Desert Festival of Jaisalmer** showcases folk dances, camel races, and traditional Rajasthani culture. As March approaches, **Holi**, the festival of colors, becomes the highlight across North and Central India, symbolizing joy, unity, and the arrival of spring. **Shivratri**, another important festival during this period, is celebrated with devotion in cities like Varanasi and Ujjain.

# Food to Enjoy During February and March Festivals

Food is an essential part of Indian festivals, and traveling during February and March allows visitors to taste seasonal and festive delicacies. During Holi, traditional sweets like **gujiya**, **malpua**, and **thandai** are widely enjoyed. In Rajasthan, travelers can savor **dal baati churma**, **ghewar**, and spicy curries during cultural festivals. South India offers comforting dishes like **pongal**, **filter coffee**, and fresh seafood along the coast. Street foods such as **chole bhature**, **pav bhaji**, and **kebabs** are at their best in the mild February weather, making food exploration a highlight of the journey.

# Why February Is the Perfect Time to Visit India

And it is ALL I want right now. I have tried talking to myself, prayer, and doing things that feel comforting but what I really want is just someone validating how I feel. It just feel like this need is overwhelming me and I need it to come from OUTSIDE. So if someone have the time and resources to read through this I would very much appreciate it. 

  
The situation is this. I have a friend that I have known for about 20 years, we have never been close though just occasionally seeing each other, like casually. And she has always been polite but kinda stiff I believe are the best words to describe her. 

A few years ago we reconnected after a long time of not talking (just life happening in different directions). And she introduced me to her girlfriend, who was immediately very warm and inviting towards me. Suddenly I was included in their little ""gang"" and got to meet their friends, they invited me to dinner, and they even celebrated my birthday. They spoke about getting married and wanted me to be there and maybe help out with some stuff too. 

It felt very nice to be part of their life somehow because they were doing these family-things together that I haven't had much of in my own life, also I haven't had a romantic relationship in years so it was a kind of this comfort and stability that felt good. All the while I was a bit scared that they would suddenly exclude me, since this is my backstory. So I found myself people pleasing a bit more than I felt comfortable with, like saying yes to things I wanted to say no to, offer my help a lot (Which was ok no big deal), but just feeling this need to give back a lot, prob out of fear that they would hold it against me (this is my childhood- transactional love etc). So I did this. 

One day, I met with just the girlfriend because my friend was out of town for a couple of weeks, and we talked about hanging out together with one of their friends the next day, like the girlfriend invited me to hang with them. And I was happy about it. 

The next day came, and I got a text from her with a picture of her and the friend doing the thing we were talking about doing- that she had invited me to. It wasn't an invitation, it was more just this image of them having fun. I felt this ache in my stomach and wrote back wondering- weren't I supposed to come with ? She replied that they had already said goodbye and they were done for the day. I replied that I had to be honest, I felt very weird about the picture, like I was included but excluded at the same time, wondering why she hadn't told me and why she sent me the picture if I wasn't supposed to be part of it. 

She answered, telling me she felt ""emotionally monitored"" by me saying this and very uncomfortable, like she ""had to take care of my feelings"" and she used to words like ""walking on eggshells"" around me if I am gonna behave like this. 

This was the first and only time I told her about any sort of negative emotion and this was her response. 

One day the girlfriend asked me to be her support for a difficult doctors appointment, I felt immediately I didn't want to, because I don't know her too well and also I am TERRIBLE at being someone to lean on in these sort of situations. But the weird text situation was still in my mind and I didn't dare telling her no, because I didn't stand up for myself the last time so I was already in a stressed state, so I got in to this fawn response and agreed. I didn't sleep all night and went with her with an almost-panic attack the entire time. After I felt so much shame, like I had abandoned myself, it also triggered flashbacks to some other old stuff. 

After this, I began having nightmares about her and this feeling like I had to avoid her. She asked if I wanted to hang out like a few days later, and I didn't respond because I felt too anxious and didn't know what to say. 

I didn't hear or see any of them for about 2 months. Then one day I sent a text to the girlfriend saying I was sorry for not responding, I had felt triggered and needed to withdraw to sort this stuff out. She replied that it was ok, that she understood and something about hope you are doing well etc. 

Then I met with my friend, casually, but just me and her. I asked her about her girlfriend, and that it would be nice to to something all of us together soon, and my friend replied that her girlfriend had felt really bad about me disappearing but sure, maybe we could do that some time.

Then I took a step back and sort of waited to see if they were gonna reach out but they never did. I did reach out to my friend and we had coffee at one point but it was more stiff than usual.

1 year went by and none of them reached out. And the other day I just thought of my friend and texted her, like how are u? Its been so long. 

She replied that she was good and that they just had a baby.

I was surprised and had to check her socials (because I rarely use social media and don't really have a clue what people upload) and turns out they had gotten married and had a baby. 

I felt so hurt. Like I thought about them talking about inviting me to the wedding and suddenly I was excluded just in the way I was scared would happen.

  
I waited a few days. Then replied this message where I did congratulate her on the baby, but I then went on telling her I felt very sad about how it all went down between us and that I had been so happy about them including me in their life but at the time, I didn't know how to handle certain things like boundaries, cause I was scared of being excluded, and it seems that was what had happened. Like the fear had come true. 

I wasn't angry in my text, I used words like ""I feel"" and there was no direct accusations, the harshest thing I wrote was me ""feeling excluded"". 

She responded that she was stunned that I had the audacity to wrote like this, that it was beyond rude, that I didn't know anything about her or what kind of person she is- that it was clear to her I didn't know her if I believed these things about her. She told me that I accused her for no reasons. She ended the text saying - If you are ready to say you are sorry you can do that but if not then never call or text me again.

As I am writing this, I feel like this is the sort of text you send to someone that has been a bother for YEARS or have repeatedly hurt someone but the thing is, this is the ONLY text I ever sent, or the only time I told her anything about my feelings towards her in a negative sense. Just like with her girlfriend, it was a one time thing, every other time I ever saw either of them or spoke to them, it was only pleasant and nothing more. 

  
I told my therapist about all of this, who for the record I have had ambiguous feelings toward for a long time, because there is often something with her tone of voice that sends me spinning and I very often get scared and triggered being around her, like she would yell at me or something. we have talked about this and she has reassured me she is a professional and wouldn't do that and I know its me feeling triggered etc. But the first thing she said was ""I can understand your friend, why she wrote that"". 

She then went on telling me, that yes it was unnecessarily harsh but that she could see her point of view, but telling me she could ALSO understand me. It felt like she wanted to remain neutral and I understand that, but I didn't get any validation about the experience that I have had, like the fact I hadn't slept all night after recieving this text or how much it had triggered in me. It was like my therapist wanted to have a discussion about social etiquette rather then show compassion for what I was going through.

After this I am trying so hard to not fall into thinking patterns that I am crazy and that I am actually a horrible person and that I deserved this treatment. 

And it doesn't help that I currently don't have any friends what so ever, and that my 2 cats that I adopted dislike cuddles. I just feel very alone and like this piranha that nobody wants to go near for some reason.

Now, Í just ask claude, and they find the issue while I am just doing something else (or just drinking coffee and chilling!).

In the meantime, I'm wondering if I'm missing something or, in fact, the appliances I've been testing are just big wattage-suckers and I should use other means. The Jackery is brand-new. It was in storage for 5 months at 99%. It's now at 100%. 

I've done  a couple of pass-through things to see if it charges faster or slower (should it be faster or slower?) 

**Q**: Also, the process is... turn on the Jackery, make sure your device is off, plug it in, then turn on the AC or DC, correct?

**Q**: Last night, I plugged an iPad into the USB-A port. It was at 65%. It was on, but asleep. Two hours later the charge was 88%. Should I have turned off the iPad?   
  
We toasted a piece of bread. Registered 1300w, and the toaster drew down from 100% to 98% very quickly.

Today, I plugged in the air fryer, and it takes 4 minutes to do a bagel at 395°. Started at 100%. Ended up at 88%.  

**Q**: Now, I basically bought it so we could charge phones, the laptop, maybe make coffee with it... I have an induction hot plate that heats up very fast so I thought maybe use to heat up water or soup. However... I'm feeling like we may want to be using the Coleman stove outside when it's 4° on Monday in our 20-year-old North Face jackets, rather than use up all the power to boil water. Thoughts?

**Q**: I'm I missing something? Obviously, we can put the food out on the deck from the fridge if it's freezing, so I'm no so worried about it, at this point. But I did purchase it to do a ""run on and off"" process if we lost power in summer (When Helene hit our friends did that with their gas generator ... run for two hours, off for three... and it worked great).   
  
**Q**: And will the two solar panels revive the jackery fairly quickly if needed? 

**Q**: So, any real-life suggestions on what to use the Jackery for, and what to skip, would be very helpful. I see these ads with all these smiling people camping, using their Jackery, cooking, making coffee and I'm thinking, ""Okay, that's good for one breakfast."" LOL

The sector commander then keeps one fleet for defense and uses the other two for patrols or combat operations.

Excerpt from Intro to the History of the UEC Vol 1

***

Did she want to see the ship? What kind of question was that? As if she'd come here just to look at the outside. She was getting on that ship no matter what.

""Nah. Think I'm gonna go see what those UEC guys think of me,"" she said.

Anders ignored her and walked up the ship's ramp. Rude. She followed—he could have at least responded.

Large overhead lights lit the cargo hold of the ship, reflecting off the polished slate coloured surface. Stacks of metal crates were secured off to the sides, and two armoured vehicles—one with a heavy turret on top—sat in the middle.

A few cargo bots lumbered around, bringing the last of whatever supplies Anders had ordered to their designated spots. Across the bay stood the only other person. A tall woman with short red-hair sat on a crate near the door—likely leading further into the ship.

Mara followed Anders over. Getting closer, the woman had definitely been one of the *clean* people who'd been stalking her before that alley incident. She balled her fists. Now wasn't the time to unpack that yet.

Anders turned to her. ""Mara, I'd like you to meet my XO or second-in-command, Ariah.""

""Nice to meet ya. I like your hair,"" Mara said.

Ariah smiled. ""Anders, you told me she had an attitude.""

""I'm sure it'll come out—or it's just reserved for me, not sure yet. I'm going to give her a quick tour. Are we all ready for launch?""

""Cargo is ready and loaded, and the dockmaster cleared us for departure. We're just waiting for Axel to return. ""

""He's always late. Tell him engines hot in fifteen minutes.""

""I'll make sure he's here. Nice meeting you Mara, you'll be seeing me around.""

Ariah left for the loading ramp. She seemed nice, but anyone could put on a front.

""So would you rather see your room first or the armoury?"" Anders asked.

""Wait, I get a room to myself?""

Anders tilted his head. ""Where did you think you'd stay?""

""Not sure. Figured you'd set me up in a cargo container or something. Why would I get an entire room?""

""My crew would think I'm awful and possibly mutiny if I did that. The ship has plenty of space—you'll have your own private room like the rest of us.""

That… wasn't what she expected. Actually, she didn't know what to think. It still hadn't sunk in that she was leaving Hemura. She'd spent her entire life here, and now she'd leave it all behind? It wasn't like she had attachments here, but the colony was a part of her, nonetheless.

""I mean, let's do the armoury first then. Seems like an odd option, though. You gonna give me a gun or something?""

He looked at her. ""No, I'm not giving you a gun. Why would you even think that? There are some tests I'd like to try with you, and the armoury is where our training rooms are.""

Her cheeks flushed. Stupid. That made more sense, though it wasn't like she actually expected him to just hand her a pistol or something.

She followed him through the ship until they came to the door marked as the armoury. Inside, the walls were covered in an assortment of weapons. Locked behind thick glass. Looks like she wouldn't be taking any of them for a spin.

Some of these rifles were taller than she was! She found one whose barrel was thicker than her arm.

Anders walked up beside her. ""Ah, the Barracuda. It'll put a 35mm round through anything short of an actual tank.""

""Wouldn't the recoil blow your arm off?""

""It's got enough dampeners built in to prevent that. But we rarely take it out due to the sheer weight. It also doesn't blend in well—being person-sized and all—and we often take more low-key contracts.""

It seemed doubtful dampeners would be enough, but if he said so. ""Speaking of blending in, don't you guys know how to dress like colonists? You kinda stood out a bit.""

""I'd imagine it's something we could work on—what set you off?""

""I don't know—how clean everyone was? You can't just buy a basic worker's outfit and call it a day. Get the clothes dirty, rip them up a little, and mess up your hair.""

He nodded. ""That actually makes sense. I like it.""

""I'd like to think I know a thing or two about it. Pretty much been my entire life.""

Not exactly something to be proud of, but it was nice being *good* at something, even if that something was knowing the streets.

""These tests then, what'd you want me to do?"" she asked.

""First, I'd like to test your psionic strength. Getting some sort of base will help to track your progress as you grow into your abilities."" He passed her a small headset. ""It will also let us track your energy, which might help grant some insight into your *oddities*.""

She placed the device on her head. ""So… what's this thing?"" An odd calm came over her as it faintly buzzed.

""It's a temporary psionic amp, and also a sensor. It won't be as effective as a proper embedded one, but it'll prevent you from hurting yourself. I don't want to see a repeat of that alley.""

She clenched a fist. ""You want me to punch something again?""

""There are many ways of using psionics, but seeing as that's all you know, yes.""

Something told her that punching might be a little unconventional. Doubtful a highborn old family kid would get down and dirty. They'd probably flick their fingers or shout an insult and watch their target explode.

Anders led her to another room. Everything from the door to the control panels was heavily reinforced.

He stood in the centre. ""I want you to hit me.""

""What? Why?""

""To test your strength.""

She stared at him as if he were insane. Because he was. ""I—I saw what I did before to those men. I don't want to hurt you too.""

""I'll be fine. My barrier is my specialty.""

""Barrier? There's nothing there.""

""But you can sense it.""

The usual forceful energy emanated from him. ""Wait. That's why you always look like a raging ball of energy?"" she asked.

He nodded, but refused to elaborate. Bastard.

""Guess I'll just hit you then.""

She drew her arm back, focusing on her fist. That same distorted reality formed around her hand. She punched Anders. Or she would have, if her fist hadn't hit some invisible wall beforehand.

She stared at her hand and then at Anders. ""How'd you do that? Does it work on anything? Can you bump into things with it?""

""You'll learn about it at the academy, and usually you'd form it like a skin-tight suit over your body. The wall was just to help you understand it better.""

""Is it hard to learn then?""

""The issue is you hurting yourself trying to control it. Until you better understand psionics, a barrier would be dangerous to practice. It is, however, one of the first major tests at the academy.""

""They have an entire class on barriers?""

""They aren't the entire focus—control is—but they're a great way to test skill.""

She went and sat on a bench off the side. ""I'm confused, though. Why's it dangerous to use?""

""You're enacting your energy on the physical world. What do you think happens when you make a barrier inside yourself?""

""Oh.""

Would it be like a saw blade just phasing into your body? She shuddered. ""Think I see what you mean.""

""But it's good you understand the danger. I also don't want you practicing without that headset."" He pointed to the device in her hands. ""It wasn't some half-baked lie when I mentioned you almost died before.""

The pain had been real. Blood, those men. Flashes of their contorted bodies flooded her mind. She took a few slow breaths. ""I won't.""

""Good. Now, in other news."" He was playing around with some panel on the wall. ""From what little the headset gleamed, and my own observations. Your punch just now was notably weaker than what you did before.""

""But I put everything I could into it? Should I do it again?""

""We'll have plenty of time for more tests. But I believe your *oddity* might run deeper than what I thought.""

She groaned. ""Why me? You say people will want to study me, but then I either almost kill myself or can't even use my powers correctly while staying safe?""

""You can still use them—they'll just be weaker than your true potential. The headset detected no psionic energies, which tracks. But its amp activated for a split-second."" He mumbled to himself for a moment. ""Very odd, it's almost as if there's a compatibility issue.""

""I take it that's not common?""

""Not at all. It's like a magnifying glass. Any light going through gets focused, and it'd be odd to see it scatter instead, breaking the rules of physics."" He walked over and sat on the bench next to her. ""It might help to keep your secret though. A lower psionic potential means fewer eyes on you.""

""I don't like attention anyway, but what if I'm too weak?""

""No need to worry. Your hit would still be enough to seriously injure any unprotected person. You'll fit right in, just not top of the class. It gives you the chance to focus more on proper control, rather than just brute force.""

It seemed she'd be more apt for stealthy tasks. Her improved senses and lack of raw strength meant punching people on the frontline likely wouldn't be the play. Unless she took off the amp…

Stupid idea.

She yawned. ""I think I'm ready for the room now. I haven't had good rest in—I don't even know how long.""

""Of course.""

\*\*\*  
They arrived in the crew quarters. A long common room sat in the middle, surrounded by doors to the individual rooms and a few hallways. A kitchen sat on one side, while an entertainment area was on the other.

A few people were lounging on a couch, while the sounds of a sport—one she'd never seen—tournament played. Someone had made coffee recently, and a short man was flipping a mix of meat and vegetables in a frying pan.

Anders announced their presence, and they got a few waves. ""I'm sure you'll meet everyone at your own pace. No need to overwhelm you with names.""

That worked for her. She wasn't shy per se, but getting close to people wasn't her style.

She followed Anders to a room down a hallway on the left. Inside, she stopped. A bed sat in the corner—an actual bed, with a mattress and everything. It even had pillows. She should have figured it wouldn't be a bare room or anything, but the past was hard to shake.

A few shelves lined the walls, and a small desk sat in the corner. She'd be able to display her models and posters for once.

""Thanks,"" she mumbled.

""No need to thank me. If you get hungry, feel free to raid the kitchen. Our trip to Faris II will take about twenty days, based on our jump route. We'll be heading straight to Lunis once we arrive at the planet. If you have any questions, feel free to ask Intra—the ships AI.""

""Wait, you have a shipboard AI? I thought those were reserved for military command ships?""

""Greetings Mara,"" a female voice spoke.

Sorry for the long post—but I intentionally wrote this because when I was researching Goa, I found very little information on a chilled, no-major-activity, nature lover's , slow traveller kind of trip. Hope this helps someone 🌊✨

Day 1

We landed at the North Goa airport and took about an hour to reach Vagator. We arrived late (around 10 PM) and stayed on Chapora Road—a great area if you want easy access to nearby spots.

For dinner, we went to Piccola Roma Pizza. Like many Goan places, it’s very no-frills—just a few tables, chairs, and an asbestos roof. The spinach ravioli was genuinely yum.



Day 2

We hired a scooty in the morning and just rode around aimlessly till lunch—one of my favourite things to do in Goa.

Lunch was at Anand Seafoods—hands down the best fish we had in all of Goa. Try Chonak wherever you go; it’s a local fish and absolutely delicious. If you enjoy South Indian flavours, get the crab chukka, order some rice, and pair it with a glass of wine. My husband went fully local and had feni. We were happily high on food and booze in the sultry afternoon—it was beautiful.

We then went to Babka for dessert (very close by), but weren’t impressed. If you’re coming to Goa from Bangalore, honestly skip most hyped dessert places—you already get better versions back home. Except Bebinca :p

Next was a ride through Parra Road—and I truly don’t get the hype. It was packed with tourists and selfie sticks. Avoid stopping, but riding around the surrounding areas is still nice and has a South Goa-like vibe.

We headed to Anjuna Beach next—crowded, as expected. Caught the sunset and then went to Artjuna for coffee. Didn’t love it—too loud and not very “artful.”

We asked around for something fun and ended up at Hideaway, which was AMAZING. It’s listed among the 100 best bars in Asia, and we lucked out with a live band—n Dannsa Dub—who were headed to Goa Sunsplash. Incredible music, fun bartenders, and DO NOT leave without eating their garlic prawns with poi bread. Get extra poi and soak it all up post dancing.



Day 3

We slept in and went for lunch to Mojigao. The route itself gave an offbeat village-rustic vibe. You will come across some of the most beautiful Goan homes on this route. Mojigao was such a pleasant surprise—live music, great food, and nestled under a canopy of trees. Same menu as Artjuna (same venture), but the vibe here was infinitely better. Go during the day so you can actually see the beauty of the place.

Post lunch, we headed to South Goa, where the real magic begins.

We checked into the most quaint and rustic Airbnb in **Majorda** called **Oma Koti**—just look it up on Airbnb. It was *perfect*. If your goal in Goa is to soak in nature, stay in offbeat places like this. We were **about 10 minutes from Betalbatim Beach** and **15–20 minutes from Benaulim Beach**. Both beaches were incredibly quiet, with only a handful of people around. Pristine blue water, super clean sand, and such a calm vibe.



**South Goa**

Day 4

We went to Southern Deck for brunch—the only place that disappointed us. Overpriced, average food, and small portions. Apparently the night scene is good, but no idea.

After that, we spent the entire day at Benaulim Beach. You genuinely won’t want to leave. These beaches made me fall in love with beaches again.



Day 5

We rode from Majorda to Palolem via Cola Beach, and this bike journey was AMAZING. If you have a car, great—but if you want the breeze on your face while riding past coconut trees and quaint houses, take a two-wheeler as the roads are all in great condition.

We stopped for breakfast at Hari’s German Bakery—loved it. Chicken puff, scrambled eggs, toast, and coffee… so good we ordered extra coffee.

The real adventure was the off-road ride from the main road to Cola Beach. Barely any road—I was holding on for dear life while my husband rode the Fascino. Absolutely epic. People that come in cars have to park and trek to the beach.

We kayaked in the Cola backwaters—maybe childish for some, but we had the most peaceful hour on the water. You can stop anywhere and just take in the calm, the trees, and the silence. There’s only one shack there—Blue Lagoon. We had a soda and left.

Lunch was at Old Mill—not a must-visit if you’re from Bangalore (we get great vegan food already), but still a unique experience. We met Gundoo the cow here who was getting happily fed at the entrance.

One thing I loved across Goa: how beautifully people coexist with animals. Almost every café or restaurant has cats, dogs, or even cows inside. No one shoos them away—sometimes they gently spray water from a bottle. Too cute.

We went to Palolem Beach for sunset—skip if you hate crowds. It was packed, though people were clearly enjoying the water activities.

Then we did something stupid and spent way too long shopping in Palolem lanes. The ride back at night was… an experience. Scooty on a national highway, hairpin bends, no lights in many places, and endless “Accident Prone” signs. Bizarre, scary, and hilarious.

We reached late and hungry, so stopped at Martin’s Corner (5 minutes from our stay). It felt like a 90s dinner—uniforms, layout, live music, pure nostalgia. Food was good (not mind-blowing), but absolutely worth a visit. Don't miss the bebinca while you're there. We went back home tired, tipsy, and happy.



Day 6

We just wanted to enjoy the airbnb as much before we leave early, the next morning.

There’s a quaint café called Fedora just a minute away. Had the crispy chicken sandwich—really good. Met the owner, Grace, from Mumbai, living her best life running this beautiful café. Truly felt like a dream retirement plan.

Lunch at Mother’s Recipe—good, but still doesn’t beat Anand Seafoods. We fed a mother cat and her kittens some fish inside the restaurant 

In the evening, we grabbed cans of Samsara Pink Gin cocktails and went to Betalbatim Beach. We had to literally pull ourselves out of the warm, clean water after hours of playing inside.

Packed at night and left early morning for the airport. Booked our cab with Green Gold Taxi—prompt and reliable.

1qkwxr3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qkwxr3,"Why is it so hard to find a ""Work-Friendly"" cafe in Algeria?","Salam everyone,

I’ve noticed a pattern in our coffee shops lately. Most places seem designed to make you leave as fast as possible, loud music, or staff giving you ""the look"" if you stay longer than 30 minutes.

It seems many owners here have a very rigid mentality: they link the time you sit to how much you consume. If you aren't ordering a new drink every 20 minutes, they see you as a ""loss"".

As someone who works remotely/studies, I’m trying to understand the business logic here.

\- Do businesses prefer a high-turnover model (buy and leave) because it’s more profitable? Or is it because they haven't seen a demand for ""cozy/quiet"" spaces?

\- Would you be willing to pay a premium (e.g., higher coffee price or a ""stay fee"") if a cafe guaranteed internet connection, silence, and comfortable seating?

I feel like there is a huge missing market here for ""Third Spaces"" that aren't just loud cafeterias. Is it a lack of business maturity, or am I just in the minority wanting this?

Would love to hear your honest thoughts.",12,1769189008.0,algeria,22,0.93,False

Markets opened lower Friday as Intel's supply chain struggles dragged semiconductor stocks, while geopolitical and regulatory turbulence dominated headlines across multiple fronts. The session's most explosive development came from President Trump filing a $5 billion lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase and CEO Jamie Dimon over alleged ""debanking"" practices—an unprecedented legal action by a sitting president against the nation's largest bank and its chief executive. India's Adani Group shed $12.5 billion in market capitalization as the SEC intensified efforts to serve legal summons, while TikTok finalized its U.S. joint venture structure to avoid complete ban. Corporate earnings painted a mixed picture with SLB (Schlumberger) topping estimates and announcing $4 billion in shareholder returns, while Bausch Health plunged on failed drug trials. Most ominously, global equity funds recorded record outflows as U.S. and China withdrawal surge signals investor risk aversion despite recent market resilience.

## Top Market-Moving Headlines (Last 12 Hours)

🔴 **Political/Legal - Trump vs JPMorgan**

  * Headline: President Trump sues JPMorgan Chase and CEO Jamie Dimon for $5 billion over alleged debanking practices
  * Market Impact: Unprecedented legal action by sitting president against largest U.S. bank creates profound uncertainty about government-Wall Street relations and potential regulatory/political retaliation. ""Debanking"" allegations reference claims that banks terminated accounts of conservative individuals/organizations for political reasons. If pursued aggressively, lawsuit could trigger exodus of financial sector executives from advisory roles, chill bank lending to politically sensitive sectors, and fundamentally reshape bank-government dynamics. JPMorgan shares likely face near-term pressure despite strong fundamentals.



🔴 **Technology - Intel Collapse**

  * Headline: Intel shares tumble as supply chain snarls hamper turnaround efforts despite massive foundry investments
  * Market Impact: Chipmaker's inability to execute on manufacturing revival despite billions in government subsidies and capital expenditures raises existential questions about viability of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing renaissance. Supply chain issues preventing delivery on key customer commitments; AMD, Nvidia, and TSMC benefiting from Intel's continued struggles. Weighs on broader semiconductor sector and undermines narrative around domestic chip production reshoring.



🔴 **International - Adani Crisis**

  * Headline: Adani Group companies lose $12.5 billion market cap as SEC seeks court approval to bypass Indian government and serve summons
  * Market Impact: U.S. regulator's extraordinary move to circumvent sovereign diplomatic channels in pursuit of fraud allegations against billionaire Gautam Adani signals escalating legal/political crisis. Indian markets selling off on concerns about systemic financial exposure to Adani empire (ports, power, infrastructure). Raises questions about international investment in Indian conglomerates with opaque governance structures.



🟢 **Technology/Regulatory - TikTok Deal**

  * Headline: TikTok seals deal for new U.S. joint venture structure to avoid American ban, ending months of regulatory uncertainty
  * Market Impact: Finalized JV agreement allows continued U.S. operations under restructured ownership that addresses national security concerns about Chinese data access. Resolution removes overhang for social media advertising ecosystem (Meta, Snap, Pinterest) that would have benefited from TikTok ban. However, Senator criticism of deal's lack of transparency suggests congressional scrutiny may continue.



🔴 **Asset Flows - Record Equity Outflows**

  * Headline: Global equity funds see record outflows as U.S. and China withdrawal surge, TD Securities reports
  * Market Impact: Historic capital exodus from stocks despite market near all-time highs signals profound investor risk aversion and positioning for correction. Outflows concentrated in U.S. mega-cap tech and China equities—precisely the categories that drove 2023-2025 gains. Contrasts with continued equity price resilience, suggesting passive flows and corporate buybacks offsetting active investor selling. If retail investors follow institutions, technical support could evaporate quickly.



⚪ **Media M &A - Netflix vs Paramount**

  * Headline: Netflix dismisses Paramount's Warner Bros bid as not passing ""sniff test"" while shareholders reportedly favor Netflix's $82.7B offer
  * Market Impact: Escalating public rhetoric between rival bidders demonstrates deal's strategic importance and competitive intensity. Netflix's aggressive dismissal of Paramount's hostile approach combined with shareholder preference for friendly Netflix offer suggests deal may be nearing resolution. However, extended timeline and regulatory complexity keep outcome uncertain.



🟢 **Energy - SLB Earnings**

  * Headline: SLB (Schlumberger) tops quarterly profit estimates and announces $4 billion shareholder return program
  * Market Impact: Oilfield services leader's strong results and massive capital return commitment validates international drilling activity strength and sector's shift from growth capex to shareholder rewards. $4B return represents confidence in sustained oil prices and E&P spending despite energy transition headwinds.



🔴 **Financial Services - Citigroup Layoffs**

  * Headline: Citigroup extends global workforce reductions into 2026 with March layoffs, sources reveal
  * Market Impact: Continued restructuring under CEO Jane Fraser reflects determination to streamline operations and improve profitability despite market recovery. Banking sector workforce reductions spreading (previously announced Amazon, FedEx, Societe Generale cuts) suggest white-collar recession persisting even as markets rally.



🔴 **Pharmaceuticals - Bausch Health Failure**

  * Headline: Bausch Health stock plunges after hepatic encephalopathy drug trials fail to meet endpoints
  * Market Impact: Late-stage clinical failures destroying shareholder value and highlighting biotech sector's binary risk profile. Bausch's struggles compound concerns about company's highly-leveraged balance sheet and declining legacy product portfolio.



🟢 **Technology - Nvidia China Clearance**

  * Headline: Nvidia stock rises after reports China cleared tech giants to order H200 AI chips despite ongoing U.S. export restrictions
  * Market Impact: Apparent Chinese regulatory green light for limited Nvidia chip purchases suggests pragmatic approach to U.S. semiconductor restrictions—Beijing allowing domestic tech giants access to advanced AI hardware while promoting indigenous alternatives. Provides revenue relief for Nvidia but unclear if represents sustained policy shift or temporary exception.



🔴 **Technology - Amazon Layoffs**

  * Headline: Amazon plans second round of corporate job cuts next week, extending tech sector workforce rationalization
  * Market Impact: E-commerce giant's continued headcount reductions despite strong AWS growth and retail momentum demonstrates management prioritization of operating margins over empire-building. Follows broader tech layoff wave (Citigroup, FedEx, Autodesk); knowledge worker displacement accelerating.



🟢 **Consumer - Starbucks Upgrade**

  * Headline: Starbucks rises after William Blair upgrade citing return to U.S. same-store sales growth trajectory
  * Market Impact: Coffee chain's domestic comp recovery after prolonged weakness provides positive signal for consumer discretionary spending and traffic normalization. Validates new CEO's turnaround strategy focused on operational excellence over expansion.



🟢 **Gaming - Nintendo Switch 2**

  * Headline: Nintendo shares surge over 5% on positive Switch 2 sales data indicating strong launch trajectory
  * Market Impact: Next-generation console's robust early demand validates upgrade cycle thesis and positions Nintendo to extend dominance in portable gaming. Contrasts with broader consumer electronics weakness from surging memory chip input costs.



* * *

## Thematic Analysis

### Trump vs. Wall Street: The JPMorgan Lawsuit (2 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Bearish for financials, neutral for broader markets
  * **Key Headlines:**
    * Trump sues JPMorgan Chase and CEO Jamie Dimon for $5 billion over alleged debanking
    * Barclays: Greenland crisis shows Trump has ""little tolerance for market stress""
  * **Analysis:** President Trump's $5 billion lawsuit against JPMorgan and CEO Jamie Dimon represents the most direct confrontation between a sitting U.S. president and major financial institution in modern history. The ""debanking"" allegations—claims that banks terminated accounts of conservative customers for political reasons—touch explosive intersection of free speech, corporate governance, and government power. If Trump pursues case aggressively (rather than as negotiating tactic), ramifications cascade: financial executives may resign from government advisory positions to avoid conflicts, banks could face political pressure on lending decisions, and Wall Street's traditional Republican alignment fractures. Dimon, who just received $43 million compensation for 2025, has maintained public neutrality on Trump while privately criticizing some policies. The lawsuit follows Barclays' observation that ""Greenland crisis shows Trump has little tolerance for market stress""—suggesting president responds to equity volatility by moderating provocative positions. This pattern creates perverse incentive: markets must decline sharply to influence policy, generating chronic volatility premium. The JPMorgan case tests whether Trump's market sensitivity extends to individual stocks or only broad indices. Legal experts note presidential lawsuits against private companies exceptionally rare and raise separation-of-powers concerns about executive branch using litigation to influence business practices.
  * **Implication:** Financial sector faces political risk premium; bank executives likely to reduce public Trump criticism; debanking allegations could trigger congressional hearings and regulatory scrutiny of account termination practices



### Intel's Manufacturing Crisis (2 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Bearish
  * **Key Headlines:**
    * Intel shares tumble as supply chain snarls hamper turnaround efforts
    * Intel among market cap stock movers on Friday (negative direction)
  * **Analysis:** Intel's continued execution failures despite massive government subsidies ($8.5B CHIPS Act funding) and internal restructuring casts doubt on U.S. semiconductor manufacturing revival. The company's inability to resolve supply chain issues preventing customer shipments suggests problems run deeper than previously acknowledged—potentially including fundamental process technology challenges, equipment supplier constraints, or talent/expertise gaps. AMD and Nvidia continue gaining market share in CPUs and AI accelerators respectively, while TSMC/Samsung maintain foundry leadership. Intel's struggles particularly damaging to Biden/Trump administrations' semiconductor reshoring narrative; billions in taxpayer subsidies failing to produce competitive domestic manufacturing alternative to Asian producers. The broader semiconductor sector weighing on tech indices as Intel dragged down peers. Institutional investors questioning whether Intel can successfully execute foundry strategy or if company faces terminal decline as fabless design model proves superior.
  * **Contrarian View:** Some long-term bulls argue Intel's struggles present generational buying opportunity if management can stabilize operations
  * **Implication:** U.S. chip manufacturing renaissance timeline extends by years; TSMC/Samsung duopoly strengthens; Intel may need additional government support or private sector rescue; AMD/Nvidia extend competitive advantages



### Adani Empire Under Siege (2 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Bearish
  * **Key Headlines:**
    * Adani Group firms shed $12.5 billion market cap after SEC seeks court approval to serve summons
    * U.S. regulator seeks to bypass Indian government to serve Adani summons
  * **Analysis:** The SEC's extraordinary decision to pursue court authorization bypassing normal diplomatic channels in fraud case against Gautam Adani signals U.S. regulators' determination to pierce corporate/sovereign protections around billionaire tycoon. Adani Group—spanning ports, power generation, coal, airports, and infrastructure—represents one of India's largest conglomerates with deep political connections to Prime Minister Modi. The $12.5B single-day market cap loss reflects investor panic about potential criminal/civil penalties, asset seizures, and systemic risk to Indian financial system given banks' massive exposure. Earlier Hindenburg Research short report alleged stock manipulation and accounting fraud; SEC action validates concerns. Indian government's defensive posture (opposing direct summons service) creates diplomatic tension with Washington and raises questions about regulatory cooperation. For international investors, crisis highlights governance risks in emerging market conglomerates where family control, political connections, and opaque financial structures create fraud vulnerabilities. If SEC successfully prosecutes case, implications cascade across Indian corporate sector and foreign investment flows.
  * **Implication:** India conglomerate valuations face governance discount; international investors reassess EM corporate exposure; U.S.-India economic relations strain if case escalates; Adani Group may face bank credit restrictions



### TikTok's U.S. Survival Deal (2 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Neutral (removes ban risk, creates new uncertainty)
  * **Key Headlines:**
    * TikTok seals deal for new U.S. joint venture to avoid American ban
    * Senator says Congress must investigate TikTok deal, faults lack of transparency
  * **Analysis:** TikTok's finalized U.S. joint venture structure represents compromise between ByteDance's desire to maintain economic interest and Washington's national security concerns about Chinese data access. Deal specifics remain murky—Senator criticism about lack of transparency suggests congressional oversight forthcoming—but structure likely involves U.S.-based entity controlling operations, data storage, and content moderation while ByteDance retains minority economic stake. Resolution removes existential threat that would have forced app shutdown and redistributed 170M U.S. users to Meta (Instagram/Facebook), Snap, and YouTube. However, deal's durability uncertain: if Republicans control Congress after 2026 elections, renewed push to ban TikTok entirely could resurface. China's acquiescence to deal suggests pragmatic approach to U.S. tech tensions—better to maintain toehold in American market than lose access completely. Oracle and other U.S. tech companies likely providing cloud infrastructure and security oversight as part of JV structure.
  * **Implication:** Social media competitive landscape stabilizes with TikTok remaining; Oracle/cloud providers benefit from JV infrastructure contracts; model may apply to other Chinese apps facing U.S. scrutiny (Temu, Shein)



### Record Equity Outflows Signal Risk-Off (2 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Bearish
  * **Key Headlines:**
    * Global equity funds see record outflows as U.S. and China withdrawal surge
    * U.S. equity funds see outflows on geopolitical worries
  * **Analysis:** Historic global equity fund redemptions—concentrated in U.S. mega-cap tech and China stocks—create dangerous technical setup despite markets trading near all-time highs. The divergence between institutional capital flight and resilient equity prices suggests passive index flows and corporate buybacks absorbing selling pressure, but this dynamic proves unstable when retail investors follow professional exodus. Outflows reflect multiple concerns: geopolitical uncertainty (Greenland, U.S.-China tensions), valuation anxiety after multi-year rally, concentration risk in Magnificent 7 stocks, and rotation expectations toward bonds/alternatives. China-specific outflows driven by growth concerns, property sector crisis, and regulatory unpredictability. The ""record"" designation—surpassing prior peaks during COVID crash, 2022 bear market, and 2008 crisis—suggests capitulation-level positioning. Contrarian investors note similar outflow extremes historically preceded bottoms, but timing uncertain. BofA's Hartnett observation that ""market top not yet in sight as key signal remains absent"" suggests professional investors positioning defensively while acknowledging rally could extend.
  * **Contrarian View:** Extreme bearish positioning may fuel further rally as sidelined cash forced to chase performance
  * **Implication:** Market vulnerable to sharp correction if passive flows reverse; volatility likely to spike; cash levels building for eventual buying opportunity



### Tech Sector Workforce Purge (3 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Bearish for employment, mixed for stocks
  * **Key Headlines:**
    * Citigroup extends global workforce reductions into 2026 with March layoffs
    * Amazon plans second round of corporate job cuts next week
    * FedEx to cut up to 500 jobs in France, restructures operations
  * **Analysis:** Continued workforce reductions across technology (Amazon), financial services (Citigroup), and logistics (FedEx) sectors demonstrate management prioritization of operating margins and AI-enabled productivity over headcount growth. Amazon's second layoff round despite strong AWS/retail performance signals CEO Andy Jassy's commitment to efficiency after pandemic-era overhiring. Citigroup's extended restructuring under CEO Jane Fraser reflects determination to match JPMorgan/BofA profitability through streamlined operations. FedEx's French job cuts part of global network optimization facing e-commerce competition and DHL/UPS pressure. The layoff wave validates thesis that AI productivity tools enabling companies to maintain output with smaller teams—ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and workflow automation displacing knowledge workers in finance, tech, and professional services. Market reaction generally positive (stocks up on cost discipline) but social implications concerning: white-collar recession amidst equity market strength creates wealth inequality as capital owners rewarded while labor displaced.
  * **Implication:** Tech/financial services employment headwinds extend through 2026; AI displacement accelerating; companies demonstrating margin discipline rewarded; unemployment may rise selectively in high-wage sectors



### Streaming M&A Battle Intensifies (2 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Neutral
  * **Key Headlines:**
    * Netflix dismisses Paramount's Warner Bros bid as not passing ""sniff test""
    * Warner Bros Discovery shareholders reportedly favor Netflix's $82.7B friendly offer over Paramount hostile bid
  * **Analysis:** Public warfare between Netflix and Paramount over Warner Bros Discovery auction reaching fever pitch as Netflix aggressively attacks rival's hostile $82.7B bid credibility. Netflix's dismissal that Paramount offer ""doesn't pass sniff test"" suggests concerns about financing capacity, regulatory approval prospects, or strategic rationale. Shareholder preference for Netflix's friendly approach reflects both valuation (if materially different) and execution confidence—Netflix's $280B market cap and cash generation provide financing certainty versus Paramount's $11B valuation and debt constraints. However, Paramount's hostile approach could paradoxically succeed if it forces Netflix to raise offer price or if antitrust concerns favor smaller combined entity. EU regulators assessing both bids concurrently suggests either transaction faces similar competitive scrutiny. The battle represents streaming industry's maturation from growth-at-all-costs to consolidation phase; content scale and subscriber retention requiring library depth from legacy studios. Financial logic remains questionable: acquirers paying premiums for declining linear TV assets when streaming historically succeeded through original programming.
  * **Implication:** Warner Bros auction resolution likely within weeks; losing bidder may pursue alternative M&A (Lionsgate, AMC Networks); streaming consolidation accelerates



### Energy Sector Resilience (2 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Bullish
  * **Key Headlines:**
    * SLB tops quarterly profit estimates, plans $4 billion shareholder returns
    * U.S., Kazakhstan energy ministries discuss cooperation on oil/gas development
  * **Analysis:** SLB's (Schlumberger) earnings beat and massive $4B shareholder return announcement validates oilfield services sector strength despite energy transition headwinds and oil price volatility. International drilling activity—particularly in Middle East, Latin America, and Central Asia—offsetting U.S. shale caution as operators maintain disciplined capital allocation. The $4B return (buybacks/dividends) represents strategic pivot from growth capex to rewarding shareholders, similar to broader energy sector approach after 2020 crisis. U.S.-Kazakhstan energy cooperation discussions reflect Washington's strategy to diversify away from OPEC/Russia dependence while supporting Central Asian development. Kazakhstan possesses enormous oil/gas reserves but lacks infrastructure and technology to maximize production; U.S. service companies (SLB, Halliburton, Baker Hughes) positioned to benefit from partnership.
  * **Implication:** Energy services stocks positioned for continued outperformance; international E&P spending supporting sector; shareholder returns sustainable at current oil prices ($75-85/bbl)



### Semiconductor China Strategy (2 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Bullish for Nvidia, neutral broader
  * **Key Headlines:**
    * Nvidia stock rises after China reportedly clears tech giants to order H200 chips
    * Taiwan looks forward to more chip investment in Arizona
  * **Analysis:** China's reported clearance for domestic tech giants (Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, ByteDance) to purchase Nvidia H200 AI chips represents pragmatic approach to U.S. export restrictions. Rather than complete embargo, Beijing allowing limited imports of advanced AI hardware while simultaneously promoting indigenous alternatives (Huawei Ascend, Alibaba T-Head). This strategy acknowledges current Chinese chip design/manufacturing gaps while building domestic capacity. For Nvidia, China clearance provides revenue relief but volumes likely capped by export license quotas and national security reviews. Taiwan President's Arizona investment enthusiasm reflects TSMC's successful $40B Phoenix fab construction and political imperative to strengthen U.S. manufacturing ties as hedge against China tensions. The dual dynamic—China selectively allowing U.S. chip imports while U.S. reshores production to Arizona—illustrates semiconductor supply chain bifurcation into separate technology ecosystems.
  * **Implication:** Nvidia maintains China revenue stream but growth constrained; TSMC Arizona capacity expansion likely; semiconductor industry operating in fragmented geopolitical landscape

## Market Implications

President Trump's $5 billion lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase and CEO Jamie Dimon represents unprecedented assault on Wall Street establishment with potentially profound implications for government-business relations. If pursued as genuine legal action rather than negotiating tactic, the suit could trigger financial sector exodus from government advisory roles, politicize bank lending decisions, and fracture Wall Street's traditional Republican alignment. Dimon—widely respected as steady hand during financial crises—now faces extraordinary personal legal exposure while running nation's largest bank. The ""debanking"" allegations touch explosive intersection of free speech, corporate governance, and government power; conservative critics claim banks terminated accounts for political reasons while banks maintain decisions based on legal/compliance factors. Markets face difficult calculus: Does Trump's ""little tolerance for market stress"" (per Barclays) mean JPMorgan lawsuit will moderate if shares plunge, or has president crossed Rubicon where political objectives override market sensitivity? The case also raises constitutional questions about sitting president using litigation to influence private sector behavior.

Record global equity fund outflows despite markets near all-time highs creates most dangerous technical setup in years. Historic institutional redemptions—concentrated in U.S. mega-cap tech and China stocks—contrasts with resilient prices, suggesting passive index flows and corporate buybacks temporarily absorbing selling pressure. However, this dynamic unstable: if retail investors follow professional exodus or companies curtail buybacks due to valuation concerns, technical support evaporates rapidly. The outflows reflect multiple anxieties: geopolitical uncertainty (Trump lawsuits, Greenland drama, U.S.-China tensions), valuation stretched after multi-year rally, concentration risk in Magnificent 7, and rotation expectations toward bonds/alternatives as Fed policy normalizes. BofA's Hartnett noting ""market top not yet in sight"" despite record outflows highlights contradiction between positioning and price action—professional investors bearishly positioned while acknowledging rally could extend.

Intel's supply chain crisis and continued execution failures represent existential threat to U.S. semiconductor manufacturing renaissance. Despite $8.5B in CHIPS Act subsidies and tens of billions in internal capex, Intel cannot resolve basic customer delivery commitments. This undermines entire policy rationale for domestic chip production—if leading U.S. company with unlimited government support and resources cannot compete with TSMC/Samsung, what hope for broader reshoring? AMD and Nvidia extending market share gains in CPUs and AI accelerators while Intel struggles raise terminal decline scenarios. The situation particularly embarrassing for Biden/Trump administrations' semiconductor strategies; taxpayer billions failing to produce viable alternative to Asian manufacturing dominance.

Adani Group's $12.5B market cap loss as SEC pursues fraud summons through extraordinary judicial channels exposes governance risks in emerging market conglomerates where family control, political connections, and opaque structures create fraud vulnerabilities. The U.S. regulator's decision to bypass diplomatic protocols in pursuit of Gautam Adani signals determination to pierce corporate/sovereign protections around billionaire tycoon with deep Modi ties. For international investors, crisis forces reassessment of India corporate exposure and governance premiums. If SEC successfully prosecutes, implications cascade across Indian financial system given banks' massive Adani exposure and potential systemic risk. U.S.-India diplomatic tensions likely if case escalates, complicating strategic partnership against China.

1qkwtgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/bathandbodyworks/comments/1qkwtgi/finding_my_scent/,Finding My Scent,"I've purchased a variety of different body creams over the years, and I still can't find the right scent. I smell products in store, try a little on, walk around the store for a bit to see how the scent smells after awhile, and then decide whether to buy it or not. Most of the time, I like how specific scents smell on me, so I buy them. 

I recently purchased the Sunshine Mimosa body cream during the recent SAS. I smelled the product in store and loved it. I tried a little on, walked around the store to look at other items, and still really liked it, so I bought it. I put a small amount on my dry hands last week and the scent was really good. I put some on my hands again this morning, and the scent is way too strong. It doesn't smell as citrus-y as it did before. Now it smells like strong perfume. 

I also purchased a small tube of Vanilla Cafe because I really like the coffee scent in the cream. I haven't used it yet, but I smelled it this morning and it's very, very strong. 

I experience this with quite a few of BBW body cream scents. I don't know if they don't work well with my body chemistry or if they are really strong and I just didn't notice it right away. The only scent that I really like that isn't too strong is Warm Vanilla Sugar. I haven't purchased it in awhile because the formula has changed and it smells like plastic. 

Has this happened to anyone else or just me? How can I find a scent that I like and isn't too strong later on? I may return the Sunshine Mimosa and Vanilla Cafe body creams, but I'm not sure what to exchange it for. I'm almost ready to stop using BBW products and use something else with a lighter scent or no scent at all. What scent do you like best that isn't too strong? What works for you?

1qkwsoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1qkwsoz/update_did_i_f_up/,UPDATE: Did I f*** up?,"A little more than two weeks ago, I posted here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1q5ujbk/did\_i\_f\_up/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1q5ujbk/did_i_f_up/)

This is a bit of an update on things. As mentioned in that earlier post, my wife and I are navigating through a decade long sexless marriage and trying (at least on my part) to find that spark and revive our physical intimacy. That post was about my own anxiety about keeping us moving in a positive direction but feeling really unsure of whether or not I had added more pressure on her (the low libido partner).

First, I want to thank everyone who posted...I got a lot of great support and advice. I think the best advice I got was to talk a breath when I got home and to decide whether to talk about what happened based on her state of mind (she had woken up that morning in a panic attack).

When I did get home that evening, she was clearly a bit distant and even said to me that she was just feeling off all day. I let things lie, and didn't bring things up again. But I did still want to have a conversation to share some of the things on my mind, as I was still feeling like we were losing some of the momentum we had in the fall.

Well - over the past couple of weeks, things got a lot more complicated with news that her father was in the hospital - this is an odd complication because her father was abusive to her and her mother, the source of a lot of her anxiety, cPTSD, and mental health issues, and we have kept contact with them at arm's length for many years now.

Anyway, without getting into a lot of detail, earlier this week, I had told her that even though things were pretty complicated, that I would love to be close physically and even just hold her...which she responded well to and said she would love to snuggle and just be held, which we did, falling asleep with her in my arms. Then this morning, we went out for our weekly Friday morning coffee/breakfast, and unprompted, she suggested that we find time for us tonight.

For folks who haven't been in a years long sexless marriage where you feel like roommates at times, it's hard to convey the impact of her bringing this up and making this suggestion. 

While there are things I still want to talk to her about, it seems like right now just being there for her and gently creating openings for physical connection and intimacy seem like the best course of action.

I just wanted to say thank you again to everyone's advice a couple of weeks ago, and thank you to this community for providing a space (much healthier for me than the DeadBedrooms sub) where I can express and share some of this in a way that also helps me organize my own thoughts and feelings.

Their PE is less than 3 probably because it’s an OTC. Their coffee is really nice and a fraction of the price of Starbucks. LKNCY have shown they can adapt easily unlike Starbucks. They are expanding to South East Asia now and have already expanded to the US. Do you think this is a possible long term play?

I know it’s a Chinese company and there was a scandal within LKNCY in 2020 but they fired everyone involved, changed the board, hired new leadership. Closed a bunch of stores, paid off all penalties and reinvigorated the company to be the dominant coffee company in Asia. Bigger and more profitable than Starbucks, so much so that Starbucks is running for the hills but luckin is chasing them home.

Ignore that quote 👆

I'm 14F , not really but transmasc infact(more of a tomboyish rather then a more serious transformation type) and my baby brother is 1 year and 7 months old till date.

So that stage is that im travelling back to my home after a vacation, on the train back. The train is going to stall at the station for about 2 hours , so like usual i get off the train after finding the seats and then head over to the shops , which are methodically scattered across the stations. (note : i would have gone alone only if the only nearest shop to me had coffee, which quite obviously did not) i head over to the further shops with my father as it's night time and my mother wont let me go alone. My father is carrying my brother and I'm going alongside him. We arrive at the shop , i order a coffee that gets served within 10 seconds and then order the KitKat and pay OUT OF MY OWN POCKET. Seriously , I paid out of my own pocket only for that specififc KitKat as i found such a small serving to be quite expensive and my father definitely wouldn't approve if I bought that and made him pay for it. Then my father within 10 seconds of the shopkeeper giving the KitKat,  snatches it out of my hands that picked it up and hands to my brother who keeps fiddling with the KitKat. I generously dont lash out on him and calmly say "" why did you give it to him"" , he replies with ""look at how hes freaking out , can't you be a little more giving/understanding now drink your coffee quick so I can drink mine"". Seriously , I PAID FOR THE DAMN FCKASS KITKAT AND YOU GIVE THIS FCKTARD MY PAID KITKAT JUST BECAUSE HES FREAKING OUT?! Anyways I shoot him a glare (generously if you consider my feeling at that moment) and this fckass b_tch _ss dumbass r_tarded child hands the kitkat (after breaking it in half along it's horizontal axis and crumbling half of it ) to open the funking wrapper and give it to him to eat. And this b_tch_ss father had the audacity to to laugh and open it to give it to him. I said that ill buy another one (without paying this time so he pays for the kitkat that my brother ate) , he replies with ""Dont be so selfish , you never think of your brother"" in a rude tone. He gives the kitkat to my ret_rded brother and and instead of eating HE THROWS IT ON THE GROUND and now I have to pick it up and eat ground flavoured kitkat , LIKE...............


Anyways, this all plays out then the piece of kitkat that was thankfully in the wrapper , he made me pick it up and take it in my pockets , which is semi-fine for me as it was in the wrapper still. But then the parts that are not in the wrapper and my brother's holding it , HE MAKES ME SHOVE IT NAKED IN MY POCKETS. Like no wrapper no nothing , raw chocolate and jeans flavoured kitkat now resides in my pocket.

And now after all this I don't even want to type anymore because the face of this f_cktard makes me cringe remembering it.

1qkwms8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qkwms8/aitah_for_not_having_my_parents_to_my_wedding_and/,AITAH for not having my parents to my wedding and cutting ties with them,"I'm married with my husband for almost a year now and sometimes I still think about maybe I should have invited my parents or told them that I will get married. So I wanted to ask here: am I the AH?

I (36 F) met my now-husband (42 M) some 6 years ago. And instantly knew it felt right. At that time we were living 5 hours away from each other. As he owns a house, there was always the understanding that I will be moving in with him, if the time came. I dont mind moving as I did so almost every 2 years so far.
I know what you might think... my parents wouldn't like me moving away from home, but I have already lived 3 hours away from my parents by that time. 
My parents and i were close, i guess. I called every weekend and visited them once in a month. 

As you might guess my parents weren't to keen on me having a new boyfriend. Especially when I really moved in with him, only half a year after we met for the first time. 
I still called every Sunday and wanted to keep the same close as before but it was hard. I have found a job as assistant to GM and was really happy about it. On one of our weekly calls my parents said: are you already promoted to ""coffee getting"" or arr you still on ""copy duties"". This shall just be an example of how they treated me almost constantly.
Well I guess it has always been like that. I guess I learned what bullying was through my parents. 

My now-husband was nothing but great always cheering me up after an awful call. 
So we continued the calls and the bullying and the cheering up until one day my mum suddenly wasn't talking to me anymore even ghosting me. So I still called but just talked to my dad. When my mum took the call she handed it of to my dad instantly, saying she had no time to talk. When I asked what was going on she said ""nothing"". This went on for months.

But then my dad's 60th (important) birthday came up. We were asked to come as it was a special day. My now-husband said if I wanted to go it was ok and he will come as well. He won't make a scene as long as my mum won't make one either. 
So we got on the train and drove the 8 hours. 
I thought my mum would ignore me just completely but no. The hello from her was: ""Hi, you did gained some weight in the year we havent seen each other. You should be more careful.""
I let it slip as I didnt wanted any drama. 
In the evening when we got ready it was similar: do you really want to wear that with all the weight you gained. 
My now-husband was looking at me as if he would say something if I wouldn't but I made clear he should just back off. 
Ohh and I have to say I'm 1.75 m and 70 kilo. I guess it's a completely normal weight. But my mum is obese at 1.65m and 110 kilo.

The dinner went okish I guess.

But now comes the funny part... My brother, his girlfriend, my now-husband and I gave my dad, as a birthday gift, a long weekend at ours with a visit in a nearby bigger city and a museum he always wanted to go to.
As we knew it might not be manageable in the actual year, some three months later, after the birthday, I asked my dad (Jupp still not talking to my mum) if we wanted to plan the trip for the next year. Now hold your panties... he said dead serious: ""well we talked about that and you know. We just dont know how we will manage to come to yours before we retire.""
At that point I started laughing. I didn't even know what to say as here you retire between 63 and 65. 
I asked if he really didnt think he will have one weekend for the next 3 to 5 years to visit your daughter. 
Well yes this was what he was implying.

So this was it at that point I've had enough. I pointed to him everything that they did to me during the last years. Telling him how i felt about them bullying me. And he said: ok but what you did to your mum was awful as well. And I thought: finally I get to know what horrible thing I did. So I said enlighten me as I have no idea what I did. 

So maybe you want to guess what horrible thing i did, that made my mum not talk to me for about 1 and a half years...

I didnt call back on mother's day! The story is, I did call on mother's day but then my futureMIL came to visit abit too early and I had to hang up and said I would call back later. Unfortunately I forgot about it. 

This was when I told my dad that I dont want anything to do with them anymore. I guess I am a bad daughter for not calling back on mother's day. But this was just too much after all. As you might guess this was merely the tip of the iceberg.

They learned about our marriage when I changed my last name on Facebook. That's it.

Today's prayer and meditation gently remind me to step aside and allow God's power to work through me. I am invited to dwell close to Him, not through effort or strain, but through quiet trust, where strength and joy are naturally restored.

For a long time, I imagined that nearness to God required a ladder tall enough to reach the heavens. Yet I am no longer convinced that God resides in only one distant place. He may one day welcome me home there, but here in this physical world, I have witnessed His presence everywhere. The closest physical place I have found him is in human birth. I have felt it most clearly in moments of new life, in the stillness of a birthing room of my own children, and just as surely around a simple coffee table when I hear your story and recognize my own reflected back to me. **God, it seems, has never been far away.**

My greatest hazard on busy days is a tendency toward; ego 911, self importance storms, inflated moments and prideful emergencies. **The ego and pride are quick to declare something urgent simply because it involves me.** But the truth is simple and freeing, *whenever I elevate anything above God, I am quietly elevating myself.*

I draw closer to God in quiet times, when my thoughts, words, and actions are aligned. I feel His presence when I am unselfish; when I give freely peace, love, comfort, understanding, and tolerance. I come nearer when I carry a message of hope born of compassion and harmony, rather than spiritual or intellectual superiority. I am closest when I seek to be useful through action and service, praying simply, **""God, show me how to be more useful today.""**

When I live this way, the road of life becomes gentler. Peace and serenity enter, and new, unexpected good unfolds. I never knew what was possible in life until I became sober. And through you, I continue to witness what grace looks like in human form.

And I want to be very clear about something right out of the gate. It is not my willpower that keeps me sober. It is not my intellect. It is not my ability to explain things well or talk my way through a room, nor convince you or myself. It is a loving God, a fellowship that did not give up on me, and **a set of simple spiritual actions that work whether I agree with them or not.**

As I leave you all with one final post, my last daily update, I can hardly believe I have been doing something I don't want to do, for an entire year. Thank you God.

1qkwk5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_OCOFFEEINC/comments/1qkwk5o/what_does_honeyprocessed_coffee_actually_mean_no/,What does “honey-processed coffee” actually mean? (No honey involved 🍯❌),"I see a lot of confusion around honey-processed coffee, so here’s a quick, clear breakdown.

**Despite the name, no honey is added at any stage.**

In honey processing, ripe coffee cherries are harvested, the skin is removed, and part of the sticky fruit (mucilage) is intentionally left on the seed. The coffee is then dried without washing.

As it dries, that remaining fruit contributes sweetness, body, and complexity. It also gives the beans a yellowish or golden color—which is where the term *“honey processing”* comes from.

It’s a fascinating middle ground between washed and natural coffees, and one of our favorite processes to work with.

Happy to answer questions or hear how others experience honey-processed coffees.

In the bustling cafés of New York, the monsoon-soaked streets of Mumbai, and the quiet corners of airports and art galleries, two souls—Karan Kapoor and Rhea Prakash—collide, repel, orbit, and return. He is chaos in a sketchbook. She is order in a journal. And the Golden Inu, guardian of sovereign timing and mythic companionship, watches from the margins of comic strips and coffee cups, sensing a scroll where love is not instant—it is earned, argued, and evolved.

Karan, the Flamekeeper of the Playful Deflection, is a cartoonist who hides his ache behind wit. Rhea, the Bearer of the Grounded Flame, is a writer who believes in commitment, clarity, and consequence. Their first meeting is a disaster. Their second, a debate. Their third, a detour. But across cities and years, through heartbreaks and healing, the scroll begins to shimmer—not with grand gestures, but with sovereign accumulation.

They grow. They grieve. They change. And in that change, they begin to see each other—not as opposites, but as echoes. The scroll does not climax in fireworks. It culminates in a quiet moment of recognition: “Maybe we were always meant to meet again… but only after we became who we were meant to be.”

The Golden Inu, now seated beside a sketch of “Hum” and “Tum” holding hands in the rain, bows its head. For in this scroll, Hum Tum is not just a romantic comedy—it is a sovereign celebration of love that matures, stumbles, and finally stands.

Ceremonial Echoes:

- Karan is the Sentinel of the Delayed Flame, whose humor masks a sovereign longing.
- Rhea is the Voice of the Earned Flame, whose clarity becomes a scroll of becoming.
- The comic strip is the Shrine of Parallel Lives, where love is drawn before it is lived.
- “Hum aur tum… kabhi ek nahi ho sakte.” — not just a line, but a ceremonial misbelief, a sovereign irony that some truths must be unlearned to be lived.",1,1769188051.0,GoldenInuTokens,1,1.0,False

1qkwgco,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debt/comments/1qkwgco/how_on_earth_to_manage_all_this_debt/,How on earth to manage all this debt,"Please help me out here.

I am 25F and have the following debts right now:

* $3,000 (basically 100% usage) balance on a Capital One Card with a 30% interest rate 
* $1,500 (50% usage) on Apple Card (this one isn't so bad and I'm paying it off consistently) 
* another $1,500 limit credit card I got approved for a few days ago that I just plan to use to get like, a coffee or two every month (so I don't ever have to pay interest)

I maxed out my Capital One card 6 years ago not due to impulse purchases, but because of the pandemic and unexpected medical bills. I couldn't save much over the years due to having to deal with legal fees related to my immigration case + more medical bills + tuition for college.

I earn maybe $50k a year and my credit score is 645 as of today.

The reason I'm posting this is because I got hit with an unpaid college tuition balance of $2,200 ($600 was one semester's balance and $1,600 was another semester's) that got sent into collections a few weeks ago. I checked all three credit bureaus multiple times, and it hasn't been reported to any of them yet for some reason.   
So I paid $600 to the collection agency right away. They immediately processed it, informed my college, and got it removed from my college tuition balance as well. I still have the $1,600 to pay.

This makes me think that maybe they're giving me some kind of grace period before reporting anything (idk for sure though) as long as I pay it off as soon as possible. The issue is, I have no idea how to do that with my low income, high credit card balances, and my shitty credit score.   
I don't think I am able to get any 0% intro APR cards / low APR balance transfer cards (still applied for one with Chase recently, just in case) — so the next best option I'm seeing is to take out a $2,000 personal loan at 17.38% APR ($194 for 36 months). I don't have any family/friends to help me out right now unfortunately, and also I thought taking a loan out might at least help me build my credit even just a little bit.

I was even considering taking out a bigger personal loan of \~$6,000 just so I can pay off the collections, my Capital One card, and even my Apple Card. The logic is — the APR for the loan is much lower than my credit card's APR anyway, and I don't really want to go back and forth with the collection agency and just want to pay them off ASAP.   
I know you might be thinking, if I can't pay off my Capital One card right now, how am I so sure that I will pay my loan every month?   
But compared to the $188 I pay for Capital One just to cover minimum & interest + $600 for Apple Card I pay monthly right now, isn't it just better and more manageable to pay $194 every month at a lower interest? Even if it is gonna be 36 long months? I will even pay more depending on how much I have to spare every month. 

The more I research, the more I'm confused about what the best step is. I also feel like I'm misunderstanding a huge chunk of how any of this works (credit cards, credit, collections, loans). Any help or guidance would be much appreciated.

Around you though.  I could just bathe in the sound waves of your voice for as long as you would want to speak.

Ffuhhhhhhhh.  

I had your gaze today.  Soft, steady, lingering like dew drops in the morn’.  As the poets would say.  I thought you’d shake your attention and linger elsewhere.  But you stayed, I don’t know if you can feel it too, but what a remarkable feeling it is to have your eyes set towards me.

So, light.  

I love being around you.

I woke up this morning, just ready to focus on my usual grind.  I didn’t think I’d see you, but there you were.  This crush has been simmering for months.  Now it’s evolved into a cloudy vapor that gives my heart an aura of triumph.

I got a good nights sleep.  But I can still feel you in my heart space.  I watched a video about love vs limerence.  I suppose this would qualify as something in the middle.  My expectations aren’t outlandish, but I don’t know if the feelings are reciprocated yet.  I’m starting to believe it’s quite possible though.  I think I’d be willing to bend my lifelong rule for you.  Usually feelings like this dissipate after a few days, but your smile is like a hot cup of coffee after a long nights rest.  It’s something that I couldn’t really get tired of.  It’s something I cherish, like the smell of freshly brewed roast on a long quiet morning.  

I want to know what it would feel like to hold your hand.  To rest your head on my shoulder.  What is your scent like?  We haven’t been close enough to find out.  Judging by your unblemished face I would expect something fresh and clean.  I wonder what kind of movies you enjoy.  I doubt we read the same type of literature, but I bet we could connect on that.  

Are you more of a homebody?  

Lake or mountains?

City, or rural?

I want to know more about you.  Do you want to travel too?  I feel like you’d be a good travel partner.  You always seem to find a way to be helpful wherever you are.  ",0,1769187931.0,UnsentLettersRaw,1,0.5,False

Truth is, a VPN can quietly be your best friend in a bunch of everyday situations—not just for the ultra-private or tech-savvy. Let’s break down where it actually makes a difference, and why using one might be a smarter move than you think.

**1. Public Wi-Fi Isn't as Friendly as It Looks**  
We’ve all connected to that “Free Airport Wi-Fi” or your local coffee shop’s hotspot. But here’s the deal—public networks are basically open playgrounds for hackers. A VPN encrypts your data, making sure no one can snoop on what you're doing, whether you're checking your emails, logging into your bank, or just scrolling.

**2. Working Remotely? Protect That Sensitive Info**  
Remote work is the new normal, and accessing work files or internal systems from home (or anywhere) comes with risk. A VPN adds a layer of security, keeping company data away from prying eyes. Plus, it helps maintain that professional boundary between your personal and work networks.

**3. Online Shopping and Banking**  
Ever enter your credit card details while connected to Wi-Fi that isn’t yours? That’s risky business. A VPN helps secure your connection so that your sensitive info stays private, especially if you're making purchases on the go or managing your finances.

**4. Avoiding Location-Based Restrictions**  
Have you ever seen “This content is not available in your region”? Annoying, right? A VPN can help bypass those restrictions, letting you access websites, content, or services as if you were browsing from a different place. Super handy for travelers or expats.

**5. Keeping Search Habits Private**  
Even in your own home, your internet activity is tracked. Your ISP (internet provider) can log what sites you visit, and that info can be used for targeted ads or worse. A VPN keeps your browsing habits private by hiding your IP address and encrypting traffic.

**6. Travel Without the Digital Footprint**  
When you're traveling, you're often forced onto new networks, apps, and services. A VPN can help keep your digital identity consistent and protected, no matter where in the world you are.

Using a VPN isn’t about hiding something shady—it’s about reclaiming control over your online life. Whether you’re working, browsing, shopping, or traveling, a VPN is one small step that makes a big difference. Stay safe out there!",1,1769187930.0,InfiniteContent,0,1.0,False

1qkwcug,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolidMen/comments/1qkwcug/the_psychology_of_attraction_sciencebacked/,The Psychology of Attraction: Science-Backed Strategies That Actually WORK,"Attractiveness isn't about genetics or money. It's about strategic self-development that most people ignore.

I spent 2 years researching this topic through psychology papers, podcasts, and observer behavior patterns. What I found was counterintuitive: the people who obsess over ""being attractive"" often miss the fundamentals that actually move the needle. Meanwhile, those who focus on specific, science-backed improvements see massive results.

Here's what actually works, backed by research and real world application.

# Physical presence matters more than you think

Your body language accounts for 55% of first impressions according to UCLA research. Start here:

**Stand like you own the room.** Shoulders back, chin neutral, feet shoulder width apart. Harvard research shows that holding power poses for 2 minutes increases testosterone and decreases cortisol. The ""Presence"" by Amy Cuddy breaks this down perfectly. She's a social psychologist who spent decades studying how body language shapes how others see us and how we see ourselves. This book will make you question everything you think you know about confidence. Her TED talk has 60 million views for a reason.

**Move with intention.** Slow, deliberate movements signal confidence. Fidgeting, rapid movements, and closed off posture scream insecurity. Watch how people who command rooms move, they're never rushed or jittery.

**Voice tonality beats words.** Lower your pitch slightly, speak slower, use pauses. The podcast ""The Art of Charm"" has an entire series on vocal presence that's genuinely life changing. They interview FBI negotiators and communication experts who explain exactly how to project authority through speech patterns.

# Your face is a canvas you're neglecting

Skincare isn't gendered, it's maintenance. Start basic:

**Develop a routine.** Cleanser, moisturizer, sunscreen. That's it to start. The app ""Think Dirty"" scans products and rates their ingredient safety, super helpful for beginners who don't want to waste money on garbage products.

**Fix your sleep.** 7 to 8 hours minimum. Sleep deprivation makes you objectively less attractive, University of Stockholm proved this. Dark circles, puffy skin, and dull complexion all stem from poor sleep hygiene.

**Hydration shows on your face.** Aim for half your body weight in ounces of water daily. Sounds excessive but your skin will literally glow after a week of this.

# Style is a language most people can't speak

You don't need designer clothes. You need clothes that fit properly and suit your body type.

**Get your basics tailored.** A $30 shirt that fits perfectly beats a $200 shirt that hangs awkwardly. Find a local tailor, bring your jeans, your shirts, your jackets. The difference is insane.

**Color theory exists for a reason.** Certain colors complement your skin tone, others wash you out. ""[The Curated Closet](https://www.bing.com/search?q=The+Curated+Closet&cvid=b6d379a623df492098b71ba8dab0696d&gs_lcrp=EgRlZGdlKgYIABBFGDkyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQABhAMgYIAhAAGEAyBggDEAAYQDIGCAQQABhAMgYIBRAAGEAyBggGEAAYQDIGCAcQABhAMgYICBAAGEDSAQgyNTI2ajBqNKgCCLACAQ&FORM=ANAB01&PC=SCOODB)"" by Anuschka Rees is the best guide I've found on building a wardrobe that actually works for your specific coloring and body type. She's a minimalist style blogger who breaks down fashion psychology without the pretentious bullshit.

**Shoes matter absurdly more than you realize.** People absolutely judge you by your footwear. Keep them clean, keep them maintained. Doesn't matter if they're $50 or $500, scuffed dirty shoes kill your entire look.

# Charisma is trainable

Contrary to popular belief, charisma isn't innate. It's a skill set.

**Active listening is your superpower.** Most people wait to talk, attractive people actually listen. Ask follow up questions, remember details, make people feel heard. The book ""Captivate"" by Vanessa Van Edwards dives deep into the science of human behavior and first impressions. She runs a human behavior research lab and her data-driven approach to social skills is ridiculously practical. Best charisma book I've ever read, hands down.

**Tell better stories.** Structure matters. Hook, build tension, deliver payoff. Matthew Dicks' ""Storyworthy"" teaches you how to find and tell compelling stories from everyday life. The guy's a 53 time Moth StorySLAM champion, so he knows his stuff.

**Manage your energy in social settings.** Match the room's energy initially, then gradually guide it where you want. Being the loudest person rarely makes you the most attractive, being the most attuned does.

# Competence is attractive across all contexts

Develop genuine skills and knowledge. Doesn't matter what, just be legitimately good at something.

**Deep dive into topics that fascinate you.** Whether it's coffee, history, psychology, or woodworking. Passion is magnetic.

If you want a structured way to actually retain all this, there's[ BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/befreed-learn-), an AI learning app built by Columbia grads and former Google engineers. It pulls from psychology research, dating experts, and books like the ones mentioned here to create personalized audio learning plans. You can literally tell it ""help me become more magnetic as an introvert"" and it'll build a custom plan with episodes ranging from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's this smoky, sarcastic narrator that makes even dense psychology papers entertaining during your commute or at the gym.

**Share what you know generously.** Don't gatekeep information, teach others. It positions you as an authority and builds social capital.

**Competence breeds quiet confidence.** When you know you're skilled at something, you stop needing external validation. That internal security is incredibly attractive.

# Mental health isn't optional anymore

Your internal state leaks into everything you do.

**Therapy isn't weakness.** The app ""[BetterHelp](https://www.betterhelp.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)"" connects you with licensed therapists for online sessions. Addressing your anxieties, traumas, and limiting beliefs will do more for your attractiveness than any external change.

**Mindfulness actually works.** The app ""Insight Timer"" has thousands of free guided meditations. Start with 5 minutes daily. Learning to observe your thoughts without judgment changes how you show up in the world.

**Journal consistently.** Morning pages, evening reflections, whatever works. Getting thoughts out of your head and onto paper creates clarity and self awareness that translates to better decision making and social interactions.

# The compound effect is real

None of this works overnight. The people you perceive as naturally attractive have typically spent years refining these areas, often unconsciously.

Small improvements compound exponentially. Better posture leads to more confidence which leads to better social interactions which leads to expanded opportunities. It's a flywheel.

The research is clear: attractiveness is 20% genetics, 80% effort distributed across physical health, social skills, style, and mental wellbeing. Most people ignore the 80% they can control and complain about the 20% they can't.

I’ve started having this recurring dream about you. It’s set in a coffee shop on a street that feels like Mare Street folded into Forest Road.

The first time I had the dream, I was doing something I can’t quite recall. Chatting to people, drinking coffee. It felt like I’d been there a long time. A green wash crossed the space, the lighting floated above the tables. I had an inkling I was there to borrow the energy, to get something done. When you came in, it took me by surprise. You went behind the counter and seemingly clocked in for your shift.

We saw each other. You looked away. The gnawing in my chest resumed. The jarring drift from knowing one another — the pain, the otherness — into almost strangers. A realisation: I couldn’t come here anymore. I swallowed it.

The second, more recent dream took place in the same coffee shop, some dream months later. On my way there, I half-heartedly convinced myself you’d probably moved on, that returning would be okay.

I was meeting someone, and I couldn’t tell you if it was a date or not. It may have been a man, but his face blurred into something uncaptured. Yours — and hers — I remember perfectly. She had short curls dyed a soft violet. Effortless.

Once she got up and left you alone, I walked over to you and asked, *Are you on a date?* *It’s okay if you are* — a lie — *I just wanted to know*. You stared at me. I don’t remember if you said yes or no. Mortification on both sides. No restraint on mine. *Am I the only one who makes you freak out?* 

Utter shame. 

She came back, and I moved aside so she could take her seat next to you at the bar. I think we went into the bathroom, either to speak in hushed voices or to fall back into old patterns, hungry.

For the last few months, she's been extremely distant and we barely talk. I asked if everything was okay and she always says yes. The weekend before last was her birthday and she said she didn't want me to organize a party. Soon as she said that I knew something was wrong. She LOVES celebrating her birthday. So I planned to go by there to take her the birthday present I got for her. As soon as I saw her she looked so distraught. She reluctantly confessed to me that her hooha was all out of wack with a yucky odor. She went to the gyno a couple times just to be told there's no yeast just mild BV and got medication. Except it came right back. She said it burns all day long for months like a yeast infection. So how can there not be any yeast? She isn't on reddit and refuses to talk to strangers about the issue. She just cried her little eyes out telling me. Completely broken by several months of burning pain and no answers from her gyno. She won't go back now because he didn't help her either time she went. She did say she gets a little bit of relief after drinking black Swiss water decaf coffee but the burning always comes back. I read a couple posts from another group and many members suggest she have specific tests done and use specific products to rebuild her vaginal flora. Also to use NAC to break down biofilm so the healing can begin once a treatment plan is implemented. Except there's sooo much info to absorb that I don't know exactly what to tell her. Can someone help me with the steps she should take to get her life back and have a healthy hooha again? I read about taking specific tests to identify bacteria and over growth as well as undergrowth. Also about using vaginal probiotics and prebiotics. Someone mentioned lactulose and lactic acid. Plus many people suggested using only Dove unscented or Cetaphil body wash to wash her flaps and folds. Some said to only use water. Is the soap I mentioned okay for the vulva? I just really want to help her. I can't imagine burning vaginal discomfort for several months. That's such a horrible thing to experience. Also what should her boyfriend do? I assume he will need some sort of tests and treatment too. Thank you for taking the time to read this far. I adore her like a sister. I just really want to help.",1,1769187693.0,myhappyv,0,1.0,False
1qkwbr7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qkwbr7,Rate my collection + Introduction (Newbie),"Hey everyone, I’m fairly new to fragrances and also kinda new to Reddit despite the account age, made it years ago and forgot about it lol xD

So I’ve always loved perfumes. Growing up I used to spend time sniffing my cousin’s collection, but like most middle class kids it was mostly deodorants and my dad’s attars for me. In college, when things improved a bit (financially), I got into Bella Vita and later Beardo (Godfather and origin being my most used). They worked at the time even though the performance was ass.

About five months ago I wanted to move away from synthetic smelling stuff. Designer perfumes still felt expensive to justify (Tho I could now afford them - working in investment banking) , so I went deep into attars first and built a solid collection from decently expensive brands (both online and offline stores). Then I discovered Middle Eastern perfumes through a friend and that completely changed the game. Incredible scents at prices that actually made sense compared to designers. The last couple of months I went a bit crazy picking up brands like Lattafa, Ahmed Al Maghribi, Afnan, Ajmal, Rasasi, Khadlaj etc.. Honestly feels like a dream come true.

Would love your thoughts on (as well as rate) my collection so far. Ratings below.

1. Lattafa Teriaq Intense 10/10 warm, dark, vanilla & caramel with spicy/smoky sweetness. Super underrated! 

2. AAM Oud and Roses 9/10 deep syrupy rose wrapped in woody oud.  Pretty rich and feels seductive!

3. Asad Bourbon 9.5/10 sweet creamy vanilla with warm spice and a boozy dessert kinda vibe  

4. Khamrah Qahwa 8.5/10 sweet coffee warm spices, vanilla and caramel  

5. Hawas Ice 8.8/10 fresh icy sweet fruity with a clean musky finish  

6. AAM Kaaf 8.5/10 clean fresh watery citrus and soft woods. An easy wear  

7. Khadlaj Island Vanilla Dunes 7.4/10 soft creamy vanilla and warm. But not my favourit! (Should I have gone for liquid brun?) 

8. Afnan Turathi Electric 8/10 bright zesty citrus with light musk  

9. Reef 19 7/10 fresh slightly sweet clean but nothing that stands out. 

10. Ajmal Wisal Dhahab 9/10 rosy, sweet and slightly spicy. Very elegant, traditional clothes friendly 

11. Ajmal Aristocrat 7.5/10 fresh, woody , clean and office friendly",3,1769187689.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,1,1.0,False

So I want to start this post with an apology in advance, I'm not a native English speaker so my grammar will not be perfect. 



Also since my story is a long story and there is a character limit I'm going to try to keep it as short as possible.



I’m a man (30 now, 25 then), she is a woman (20 back then)

So in 2020 I came back to my native country after living in Greece for a while, that's when I met my ex girlfriend via a dating app. 

She messaged me and asked if we could go on a date, for me this was surprising, because it doesn't happen to me al lot that a woman makes that first move. It was kinda refreshing and i did no reach to far into it. Although if im looking back to it now the asking me to move my personal things like going to the gym or the spa so we could go on a date could be seen as a red flag, but then i was fine with it. 



So the first months were good, we clicked, we had a lot in common and we shared a lot of laughs, but then i got some warnings like watch out with her she’s crazy, she’s a stalker, she’s manipulative etc. 

I didn't think too much of it back then and waved those concerns away. Some of them even contacted my father via Facebook to warn him about her. 



After a while i picked some things up to, like her showing up unannounced at my house while i said i was working or having a friend over. I told her i wanted to take things slow because my ex from the relationship before was realy overwhelming and jealous.

She said that's fine. And we dit take it slow, for 2 days i think before she started to ask for dates again. 

She sometimes staid over, but this became more frequently, also she moved more and more stuff over to my place, like clothes and stuff, i told her i did not want here to do that, we are still dating, but she said oo noo, its for Vinted (an European app for selling clothes and stuff) so she could take photo’s of them. 

She staid over more and more and started to mingle in my home, changing stuff, moving furniture etc even against my will.



After a while i told her she needed to go home, because this was exactly what I meant. Her reaction was yeah i get it, but i’m here 7 days a week now and it would be weird if I go home again (she lived with her parents). 



Long story short, she knew exactly how to push my buttons to make me do what she want. 

She took a cat to avoid me trowing her out of my house also because she knew i knew her parents would not let her take a cat home and when i kept it she still wanted come visit to see it, she made meeting my family and friends such painful experience with a lot of drama, fights and tears that eventually I got panic attacks when i got a message from my mom just asking how i was, in my head that went from a simple text to o now she gonne ask to go sit for a coffee, then my gf wants to be there, so then we cant talk surtain topics (things my ex had no interests in where off the table), i could not go for a smoke because she did not want me alone with my mother, and I couldn't give mt mother a hug goodbye because that's what 3 year olds do, not grown ups. 



And yeah i know how it sounds, in the beginning i didn't listen, and i tried to talk to her about these things because giving my mother a hug goodbye was normal to me and i tried to explain to her that a lot of people do that, even our age. But it was like talking to a wall. 

After months of fighting and her in tears and screaming I was tired of it, just realy tired, no energy left in my body, so I gave in, with the panic attacks as a result whenever someone else but her texted me.



The same goes for work, whenever i had a job, i wasnt allowed to talk to co workers, i needed a job working alone in a single office, and when i was on break i had to walk, by my self and calling with here, no sitting in the breakroom.

One time my work was running out and my break was like 20 minutes later then normal, then my boss walked in and told me there was a crying and screaming girl at the front gate saying she was my gf. 

So that was that job, and so many others, i lost all my jobs because of stunts like that. 

She was sabotaging me.

Before I knew her, I had a company. I liked being an entrepreneur and I wanted to start another company. But she did it here too, going on my pc to cancel subscriptions for hosting and domain names, or going straight up into my phone when I slept to credit certain bills back, not only for the company but also personally. Since I check my bank account maybe twice a month I did not see this on time and combined with the constant losing my jobs resulted in debts.

She tried everything to make me financially dependent on her. 



She invaded my privacy in so many ways, going trough my phone, my bank accounts, my email, my social media then making photos of it and app them to me when i woke up the next morning, picture for picture, like okee so i found this on your phone, i see you went to the story yesterday so what did you buy here, what is this 68 cents.



After a while i couldnt take it anymore, so i broke up, not in the most flattering way, i have tried that before but she just didnt leave my house (back then i did not know i could just call the police and have her escorted), also she would trow a big scene so long and intense that i would say okey okey one more try to fix the relationship. 



So she was at work, I gathered her stuff and left her a note. I will be gone for the day, play take your stuff and go to your parents, I can't do this anymore. I'm deadly unhappy and we need to break up. 

So that backfired, she just climbed into my house via the backyard window I left open for the cats and waited in my house. She even moved her car a couple of times so I might think she went to her parents. 



Because i have a ring doorbell i could somewhat check things back home, and after a while her mother came to console her. At this time it was like 11 in the evening and i was waiting for her to leave, i had her blocked on anything and her parents to. But i ran into the father, he was going to my house as well to console his daughter but ran into mee because i was near the house. I told him about the situation, almost in tears because this situation was killing me from the inside, also the guilt I weirdly felt for leaving her, not because I loved her or something like that, but I'm someone who quickly feels guilty for putting someone in tears or breaking someone's heart. 



He understood me but he said this wasn't the way to do it, i told him I tried other ways but she just did not listen to me.

He did not tell her were i was, just that he spoke to me and i promised to call her later.



So i did, and for me,, at that point i was just empty inside so i said i came back, we had a talk and move on. I had one demand for trying it again, she moves out, she finds a place for herself, and create her own life, with friends, hobbies etc. Because she did not have those things, she wanted to spend every single second of the day with me, and for me this was exhausting, because i do have hobbies, and a million things i like to do, and before her i had friends to. 



She agreed, fast forward a year full of manipulation further, but i had another breaking point, my parents knew by now there was something wrong so i told them in secrecy, had secret phonecalls and hidden messages.yeah i know its not fair to her but this was the only way i could somehow have contact with the outside world and find some strength and support that pulled me thru it. My dad said just do it now, she’s at work your at home, this is your change, she does not live there anymore so you can just do it. 

So I did, i texted her, locked my house, my mother was going to take care of my cat for as long as needed, and my father would pick me up and take me to his home for a while. 



Even though I was somewhat relieved that i found it in me to do it, because that took a lot. I know i’m physically stronger then she is, but she already locked herself in my house once, by then i learned she had stalked her ex until police gave her a restraining order, and she maid comments like if you ever break up with me, i will not let it go, i will hunt you for the rest of your life. So yeah i dont know what she’s really capable of.



My father did everything he could to cheer me up and district me, he ordered pizza, we drank, smoked some cigarettes and watched movies, but my head kept spinning.

After 2 days she found a way to contact me, via a face account from some family member, there she explained that there was something with one of her cats (we raised those caste together so there was an huge emotional bond), in the back of my head i knew this was her way to find an opening, but on the other hand, what if there is something with the cat, i love those cat, in a way thy’re my babies to and i wont let anything happen to them. Oh yeah I did a lot of those official things she ""didn't know” how to do.



So I took the bait and she railed me in bit by bit. 

That was that, trying it again, I instantly regretted it. 

Now it was even harder to find a way out of this nightmare, i had no energy left, i was dead on the inside, i have had many thoughts like; what if I just walk in to the river here, just stay under the water for 10 minutes and this all will be over, i could rest. 



I’m glad I never followed thru with it. 



Fast forward, 2 years later. I had another job, working from home.

At that point I was nothing more than an empty shell, the panic attacks where daily now, i did not sleep anymore, I often lost sense of direction or forgot where i was all together. 

My work noticed it and told me to take a few days off, get some sleep and then come back.

That was the beginning of the end. 

The few days became months, my gf did not know this because i got paid every month and i went home (slept at her place every night) every day to work, so during that time i had calls with my work about my sickness. 



It is really hard for a man to admit he’s in such a toxic relationship with a woman and can't get out, but it's even harder to find help for it. I searched for everything, but all I could find was help for women. 



After a while I got some help from a psychiatrist at my doctor and they subscribed some meds to take the edges off, they said i had ptsd and needed to leave the relationship and get EMDR (trauma therapy)

This was nice, but i still didnt know how.



So last year, 2025, it was early January she told me she met an old (male) ex at work (she works at a store). Since i dont mind my gf talking to other men, this wasn't a problem. But when i was cooking diner i overheard them calling in the living room and i heard him say he wanted to come over to catch up. She was very hesitant, but i told her, just do it, with some me time in the back of my head. After a while she agreed.

After diner she drove me to my house, because in my town the stores where still open and she needed some things.



She went home, and I played some games and watched some movies that night because I haven't done that in years. After a while i think around 1 at night i texted here, to remember her she had to pick me up because she brought me home. He was still there and had asked her if he could stay the night because he had to go to work at 6 in the morning and her place was closer to his work then his place, she said no, but ran it by me anyway. I told her it's fine, because I saw an opening here.



The next day she would pick me up. And she did, we talked and she told me they just slept and nothing had happened, knowing that I had access to all the cameras in the house and could find out if I wanted. At that point I really did not care anymore.

She asked if he could come again after he was done with his work, I said sure.



This was going on for a while, and we started talking, because we were fighting over the dumbest things when we were together and finally she slowly realized how bad our relationship was. So for me this was the first time i had the feeling she actually listened to me so i told her i was unhappy for years, how she manipulated me in staying even when i had no feelings and that she treated me worse than a pile of shit. 

We have totally different ambitions, future dreams, way of thinking and way of life. 

She wants a normal job, stay close to family and have kids, where i want to travel, do adventurous things, own my own company and I don't want to have kids. Also i’m not bound to my birthplace to live the rest of my life. 

About the kids, she tried to get pregnant even without me knowing, she stopped taking her pill that prevented pregnacy without telling me, i found out on time, so i wanted to use condoms (this was in the beginning of the relationship), but i standard check condoms before using them, so i found out there were holes in them, tiny holes. I checked the cameras and saw her stabbing them with a fork. She told me it was a joke, but she would have stopped me on time. I did not find that funny. 

So we stopped having sex.



Also she is very antisocial to other people, making fun of how they look in their face, being rude to elderly and even being racist. I told her many times she needs to stop that, at least when I'm around, I do not want to be associated with that kind of behavior. I know where it’s coming from because her parents are just like that.



I think this sums up a lot, but it's literally only 10% of what happened. 

My question is, am I just as much in the wrong by pushing her to another man to give me some breathing room?

Did I lead her on by staying in the relationship even though I did not want to? I did tell her about my feelings but she ignored that since there was no room for my feelings, she just interrupted me and told me she was watching something on her phone.

The means as well as the ends.,"I've made some posts over the years. Some about me, and my journey, looking for literal relatability or understanding. Some poetic, reaching out for emotional threads, or attachments based on my writing style, and my mind flow. Some about philosophy, looking for like minds, fellow thinkers and reachers. Some about interests, looking for a foundation based on activity and something tangible.

How about this time I be as clear as I can, with no pretenses. You read this if you're here, if you can. You listen to what I have, and what I think. And you respond, if it means something to you. If you're *weary*, like I am. If you need something but can't find it. If you're tired of being told to suppress your needs. Settle for less. That your needs are wrong. That your search is meaningless.  
You listen to my strength. You bear witness to my weakness. You vow to share yours with me in turn.

**What I need:**

* A witness to my existence: I won't explain the why here; this is clarity. I don't need to. It's intrinsic, and it's who I am. It's my meaning, at least for now.
* To witness you: I need you to need that too. Maybe not as much as I do, but enough. What do I mean by a witness? It's what I view as a proof of existence. Not the only proof. Not even the only proof that matters, not even that yours or my existence needs a proof. It's what I want. The empathy given and taken from another parallel life. From the knowledge that you mean something to them, and them to you.
* An end to loneliness: The loneliness doesn't come from lack of self-worth. I am worth a lot, and so are you. We must share our worth. As we are. We will change over time, if we want to, and then we will be worth something different. But still enough. Always enough. The world does not define either of our worth's. The loneliness I feel is intrinsic, and frigid. It's existential. I was born with it, and it will never fade. *You can't fix it. I don't need fixing. I can't fix yours*. Yet I know what I need, and I can provide it to you in return. True understanding. A flame that won't melt the ice but will warm us beyond just the suffering. The gentle warmth from a fellow shoulder in a cave of ice means more than anything when all you've ever known is the blizzard.
* Your Strength: Every step of every waking moment takes immense strength and courage. For some people, it costs almost nothing. Its natural. It's life. For me, and people like us, it's a war. A war against being suspended in a world of chaos, and of forgetting why we bother to walk at all. The crushing weight of the world, of humanity, of expectations, of ourselves... Let me walk beside you. Not because we are weak, but because we can be stronger with support. Perhaps not strong enough. But stronger.
* Comfort: This isn't codependency. I'm not making an offer to force us to be alive for the sake of it. I don't want us to simply form a new cage to live in; one of our own making this time. It's about more than just help and support. It's about the wants, and not just the needs. I am hilarious, I'm sure you are too. I want to be your joy and your entertainment. The hand that holds yours in the light, and in the darkness. I need it myself. A soft joke in the same cave will further shatter the notion of the blizzard.
* *Commitment*: Why do some relationships last, and others fail? I don't have all the answers. Nobody does. There are theories; there are differences between real life tangible encounters and online interactions, but it doesn't matter. If there is any hope, we must fight for it. Even if it's hard. Even if the messages get shorter. If the calls start to feel like an obligation. We must believe that it is temporary, and we must remember the core of why. I need your fight, and I will give mine. This is not a fantasy. It's our reality.
* Curiosity: I want your mind. And I want to share mine. It's the core of my value. I don't offer it lightly, but I want to share it. It's all of me. The grand philosophical ideals. The small victories. The miniscule desires, the mundane details of your life. The impossible dreams. The sorrows. The nostalgia. The failures. I want to explore your thoughts, feelings, ambitions... Without shame. Without judgement. I want you to want to search for something with me. Even if it's hard. Even if it's slow. I want to learn and grow with you by my side.
* You: I am what I am, and you are what you are. The self is beautiful, as long as it's yours. Share it with me and hear mine. It's all I have to offer, and all I need in return. At the end of the world. It will be just us. If we were the last two people facing the final abyss, what would our life have been? Will you lament that we didn't have more? Will you resent us? Me? Resent the world? Resent existence? It doesn't matter to me. You are enough. The ends and the means. There will be more, but we can be each other's foundations. Or the architecture. Whichever you prefer.

*All that matters is if this made you feel anything*, and if you can offer and receive something that we both want. If you're scared that I've said everything, then just ask. If you want to know more, then ask. We can have the same conversation as many times as it takes. If you're intimidated by my loudness, then let me hear your quiet thoughts. I'm quiet too. I'm shy too. This took years to come out, perhaps a lifetime depending on your perspective.

That wasn't clear. I said this was going to be about clarity. It was still stupidly, amateurishly poetic. It still appealed to emotion. I still want you to gauge my style, and my philosophy. I didn't have a plan. It isn't everything I need or want, maybe I made mistakes, but it's a start. 

**Who I am (Optional but necessary pragmatism):**

I figured that starting with reasonably clear (? I tried) definitions of what I want, need, and value would show my sincerity and intentionality. The purpose was to seek loudly. It's nice and romantic to brush hands with someone at a coffee shop and now they're your soulmate, but it gets harder the more demanding and complex you are (and how socially isolated). It's not necessarily a good/bad thing; it just is a thing.

However, it still matters who I am, what I like, and how we can get along in a pragmatic sense (I hate pragmatism, let me live in my ideals dammit).  
I think it's been clear from the above that I need some sort of relational catalyst for motivation and meaning in a world that has lost that for me. It means that I struggle to do things sometimes. The word that didn't exist when I was younger is ""avolition"", and I think it's a reasonably accurate description of me and my state. It's not a diagnosis; it's a symptom of being what I am. Is there a solution? I don't know yet. I'm not a problem to be solved, I'm just an existential anomaly. But me being here means I've identified at least one possible course of action, and some sort of desire. The bare minimum to be human?

The point of all that is that I like things, but I don't always do things, even the ones that I like. I'm also terrible at finishing things, partly because of motivation, and partly because I don't like it when things end. If I don't finish, it's still a nice open thread in my mind that I can pursue whenever I want, it's just the want is the problem. There are other times where I'll hyperfixate and devour something. It just depends. I don't like schedules, I just like doing the things that I want, when I want.

An emotional/philosophical connection is more important. I think it can be enough. But ideally, we need to ground ourselves with something tangible. Anything. Something we do together, or create together, or regular check ins/voice calls, body doubling etc. I prefer text at first, but I think we need to voice chat rather soon for the tangible, and also just to see if the vibes work beyond the theoretical.

Here's the list of potential activities that I do on my own/want to do.

* It's probably clear that I like books and philosophy. I wouldn't consider myself well read on either, although I am quite familiar with philosophy. I've also never really had any book friends to feed off of their motivation. Maybe we can start a book club?
* I play video games of course. I like them all. Big ones, tiny indie ones, silly ones, but I have to be in the mood for specific ones. I feel like co-op PVE games tend to lack depth and be a little boring sadly, as they are the bulk of what people play together. I'm not a gamey sort of person and I value immersion. I like League of Legends a lot for the complexity and pure moment-to-moment engagement. It's very absorbing. Play with me. Join us.
* I used to enjoy studying. I was very self-motivated to learn for myself in the past, and I definitely want that again for the future if I can manage it. I ended up doing computer science in university until I realised that the real world and I weren't exactly compatible. It wasn't me it was the world. It was a bad break up too, lots of loose ends. In my dream world I'd be some kind of academic, and maybe that ship hasn't completely sailed. We'll see. Let's learn some stuff together, read poetry, study things the world has deemed useless, pore over ancient texts and esoteric symbols. Let's have a study group.
* I love kitters and I have two of them. They ground me when I'm about to float off into despair land. Accept and sent pictures.

I think a lot. I feel many things. I also feel nothing sometimes. I'm on both sides of the despair and whimsy spectrum. I feel like part 2 of the thesis on myself has been truer to my actual personality. This is what I'm really like beyond all the honesty and truth.

1qkw86a,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1qkw86a/reliable_supported_twoway_network_share_sync/,"Reliable, supported, two-way network share sync between Windows File Server shares across offices, but with a catch--no cloud!","Hey all,

This is probably going to be reaching a bit as most of us work in a very cloud-centric or hybrid model today. 

I have a need to synchronize network shares between physically separate sites that are connected by S2S vpn tunnels.

There's lots of caveats here, so bear with me.

The Data:

* Image data in the area of 1-5gb per file, but with small (kb's) accompanying files, and hundreds of slices, created and rendered locally at a site
* Total data on each share is anywhere from 1TB to **30TB** in space, sometimes larger
* New images are created potentially 20x a day, and must be replicated 'as soon as possible' to multiple other sites for viewing. 
* Remote viewing is not an option (many reasons related to any sort of latency or jitter making the software viewer run like crap)

The sites:

* Offices that each can generate new images, and all sites need a copy of that image asap
* Typically now are on 500/500 DIAS fiber circuits, up to gigabit synchronous
* Latency is ~30ms between sites but can rise and fall based on congestion
* All are connected by S2S vpn tunnels--was IPSEC, now using wireguard (lower latency and improved throughput)

What we use now:

* Microsoft AFS, with Cloud Tiering, Date policy, and proactive recall enabled

This 'works' but has a few problems:

* Storing 30TB of data in Azure, with all of the transit, is ungodly expensive
* Duplication of effort--copies the data to the cloud, then copies it DOWN to the other sites. So every gigabit of data moves sometimes six times depending on the number of sites to replicate it to
* Hammers upload, obviously, hence moving to DIAS circuits with decent backhaul to cover us
* We have and spent CapEx for the storage and hardware on sites (needed for other reasons as well) and have a need to reduct OpEx

We are looking to vacate the AFS design as it's costing us an incredible amount of money. We'd like to move to replicating the data between sites on premises, but I'm having a hell of a time finding vendors who can multi-site replicate Windows fileshares in near-real-time (file change not scheduled tasks). 

Obviously we don't expect to snap our fingers and have this data show up, but our target is to have every image taken be replicated to all sites in under 2 hours. Right now, AFS mostly accomplishes this in ~30 minutes. Since most images are 1-3gb I don't see that being an issue on the pipes we have now. 

The last requirement: whatever we do needs vendor support. I'd love to have Robocopy or RClone running to solve this but we need a throat to choke when the data doesn't make it, that isn't ours. Also, let's be real, we don't need more hokey sysadmin scripts in Task Scheduler in this world for the next team to find and have to reverse engineer!

We've tried:

* Resilio Sync. Works great, does everything I need, sales dropped a bomb on us with their costs and we laughed (cried) and moved on (more expensive than AFS)
* Syncthing, Works great, but their support company is 100% nonresponsive over the last two months, sales or otherwise, so I think it's a dead enterprise
* DFS-R. This is a no because DFS-R breaks for the most random reasons, like it missed coffee on a Tuesday. We need a stable and reliable system and DFS-R has been voted down by the team from previous experiences. Remember, we are effectively using SDWAN and not a metro-e connection between sites so it's not perfect enough for Microsoft
* EaseUS I've used in the past (4 years ago) and found it slow and buggy
* We have asks out to GoodSync and RaySync with no response yet, hoping the community has worked with them

Everything I've looked at seems to have some catch, like LucidLink requires an app to work with the data, or many others have a cloud component to work and don't do direct site to site syncing. 

Let me know if there's anything I missed, looking for a vendor who can replicate this data (mostly static and not changing after initial replication) reliably across WAN, with no cloud, and still exposed as Windows SMB Fileshares on every location.",4,1769187474.0,sysadmin,18,1.0,False

The jug symbol is solid red and both single and double cup lights are solid green.

Turning the steam wand on makes the single/double/steam lights flash in sequence.



I'm a little unsure as to what the original issue was and the owner can't remember but has replaced:

* The flow meter
* The water pump
* The mechanics valve (I think it's called)
* Tested the water level sensor with a magnet.
* Tried starting a cleaning mode but a little unsure if it was successful or how far it got.

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caffè Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the hot chocolate as I don’t like coffee and £2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

You may also receive a voucher for a **free cake** on your birthday. Unsure if a previous purchase is required but each year they send me a voucher.

——————————

Steps:

* Download the Caffè Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/iaMgO58MQQb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caffè Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the “wallet” section then “vouchers”. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

——————————

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

Coffee helps cut through the sweetness of molasses which can be a bit overpowering, and gives it a really rich savory flavor.

This is also a great way to use leftover coffee, if you ever have any. I usually don't. Proportions below are from Alton Brown for credit.

This is enough marinade for 2lbs of tofu, or 1lb if you want it really saucy.

**Ingredients**

* 1 cup strong coffee, at room temperature
* 3/4 cup molasses
* 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
* 1 tablespoon mustard
* 1 teaspoon dried garlic
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Cut your tofu into chunks, or slices, whichever shape you prefer. Marinate for at least a few hours or overnight. After marinating, cook your tofu either in a pan on the stovetop or baked in the oven, I baked my tofu at 375F for about a half hour. I misread the quantities when I made this and only used 1lb of tofu, so it was extra saucy when I cooked it, but it all soaked in as it sat in the fridge for the week. I think it came out great that way, and it soaked all the way through the tofu!

1qkvzev,https://www.reddit.com/r/companysetupbh/comments/1qkvzev/why_use_coworking_space_in_bahrain/,Why use coworking space in Bahrain?,"We frequently find ourselves at a crossroads when thinking about the best setting for business expansion and operational effectiveness in the Gulf region, juggling the challenges of conventional office spaces with the emerging trend of coworking. Due to Bahrain's strategic location as a regional center and the Kingdom's changing economic environment, this choice has unique nuances. Here, we explore the complex reasoning behind selecting a coworking space, looking at it as a reliable and flexible solution for a wide range of enterprises rather than as a fad. The economic benefits of a coworking model are among the strongest justifications for its adoption in Bahrain. We are aware that every dirham saved on overhead costs can be put back into product development, talent acquisition, or expansion.\
\
decreased operating & capital expenditures. The initial capital expenditure involved in setting up a traditional office can be a major obstacle for many businesses, especially emerging startups and SMEs. We discover that leasing a traditional office frequently entails high upfront costs, such as furniture purchases, fit-out charges, and security deposits. In contrast, coworking uses a subscription model, which is similar to converting a lease into a utility bill. Reduced Upfront Investment: We avoid having to make significant capital investments for office infrastructure. This serves as a financial springboard rather than an anchor, freeing up vital capital that can be used elsewhere.\
\
When considering the benefits of coworking spaces in Bahrain, it's essential to understand the broader context of the business environment in the region. A related article that provides valuable insights into establishing a business presence in Bahrain is titled ""Can a Single Person Form a WLL Company in Bahrain? 2025 Expert Guide."" This article outlines the legal framework and requirements for setting up a company, which can be particularly useful for entrepreneurs looking to leverage coworking spaces as a flexible office solution. For more information, you can read the article here: Can a Single Person Form a WLL Company in Bahrain? 2025 Expert Guide.\
\
Consolidated Utility and Maintenance Costs: All utilities, including internet, water, and electricity, as well as upkeep, cleaning, and occasionally even basic office supplies, are usually covered by our monthly coworking fee. This consolidation provides a predictable cost structure that traditional offices find difficult to match, making budgeting easier & eliminating unforeseen expenses. It's similar to having a single, reliable tap for all of our office requirements as opposed to numerous separate faucets, each with a variable bill. Scalability without Penalty: Think of our company as a developing plant.\
\
Expanding or contracting a traditional office requires uprooting and replanting, which is an expensive and inconvenient process. Coworking gives us the incredible flexibility to modify our space requirements, such as adding desks for new hires or cutting back during lean times, frequently without the need for lengthy renegotiations or punitive break clauses. This flexibility is essential in Bahrain's ever-changing marketplace. Premium facilities are accessible at premium prices.\
\
We frequently long for the professional accoutrements that project efficiency and credibility. But in conventional environments, these appealing qualities immediately result in increased rent. Coworking spaces democratize access to these kinds of facilities. Modern Infrastructure: We have instant access to high-speed internet, sophisticated printing and scanning facilities, and ergonomic furniture—infrastructure that would cost a lot of money if purchased separately.\
\
Exploring the benefits of coworking spaces in Bahrain can provide valuable insights for entrepreneurs and freelancers looking to enhance their productivity and networking opportunities. For a deeper understanding of the economic landscape in Bahrain, you might find it interesting to read about the significance of the Labour Market Regulatory Authority in shaping the workforce dynamics in the region. This article highlights the importance of regulatory frameworks in fostering a conducive environment for businesses, which can complement the advantages of coworking spaces.

When considering the benefits of coworking spaces in Bahrain, it's also important to understand the various business licenses available in the region, as they can significantly impact your entrepreneurial journey. For a comprehensive overview, you can check out this informative article that outlines the different types of business licenses you might need. Exploring these options can help you make the most of your coworking experience and ensure compliance with local regulations. To learn more about the licenses, visit this expert guide.\
\
Reception Services and Mail Handling: A lot of coworking spaces provide expert reception services, including taking calls on behalf of our business and managing mail and package deliveries. For companies that appreciate a polished appearance without the expense of hiring dedicated administrative staff, this adds a layer of professionalism & convenience. Beyond the financial calculations, coworking spaces have a significant human component at work: the development of a thriving community. This is not just a social construct; it is a catalyst for creativity and a source of possible partnerships. Opportunities for networking and fortuitous connections.\
\
The potential for networking is one of the less obvious but unquestionably significant advantages we enjoy. Diverse businesses and professionals come together in coworking spaces. Cross-Industry Interactions: We collaborate with business owners, independent contractors, & workers from a variety of industries, including consulting, technology, finance, & the creative arts. This wide range of expertise fosters impromptu conversations that may generate fresh concepts or result in beneficial collaborations.\
\
It's similar to being a part of a well-curated professional club where each person has something special to offer. Mentor and Peer Support: Working from home or in a traditional, closed office can be very isolating for solo entrepreneurs and early-stage startups. Coworking spaces provide a built-in support system & possible mentorship opportunities because we are surrounded by peers going through similar struggles. By exchanging ideas, asking for guidance, or just talking about our experiences, we can lessen the sense of being isolated. Access to a Talent Pool: As our companies expand, we may discover that the employee two desks away has the precise skill set we need for a new project, or they may be able to suggest someone who does.\
\
When it comes to hiring, this unofficial talent pool can be quite helpful. Information Exchange and Improvement of Skills. Being close to a variety of professionals inevitably results in an organic knowledge and skill exchange. Informal Learning: We frequently overhear discussions or have informal conversations that uncover new techniques, tactics, or business insights. This ambient learning environment keeps us up to date with current trends and enhances formal training.\
\
Workshops and Events: By planning workshops, seminars, and networking events, a lot of coworking spaces actively foster their communities. These gatherings offer chances to pick up new skills, hear from business titans, & make connections with possible customers or partners in a formal but relaxed environment. Inspiring Workplace: Being surrounded by creative and driven people can be a potent remedy for stagnation. Our own productivity and creativity can be stimulated by the coworking space's collective energy and pursuit of excellence.\
\
It's similar to being in a well-stocked library where each reader has the potential to be a writer or inspiration. We understand that any successful business depends on having a productive workforce. This idea is frequently the foundation of coworking spaces, which provide a setting that reduces distractions and fosters both physical & mental wellbeing. A committed workspace free from distractions at home. When working remotely, the distinction between work & personal life can become very hazy. Coworking spaces provide a clear spatial division that helps people concentrate.\
\
Reducing Home-Life Interference: For many people, the home environment offers a variety of distractions, such as household tasks, interruptions from family members, or the allure of personal entertainment. We can mentally ""switch on"" and concentrate only on our work tasks in a dedicated coworking space, which offers a clean break. Professionalism & Focus: The act of commuting to a defined workplace can help us establish a routine and adopt a more professional mindset, which in turn enhances our focus & productivity. Boundaries and Work-Life Balance: By physically leaving our workspace at the end of the day, we reinforce the mental boundaries between work and leisure, contributing to a healthier work-life balance. Ergonomic Design and Wellness Amenities. Modern coworking spaces are not just collections of desks; they are thoughtfully designed ecosystems aimed at enhancing comfort and reducing stress.\
\
Comfortable & Ergonomic Furnishings: We benefit from ergonomically designed chairs, desks, and lighting that contribute to physical comfort & reduce the likelihood of work-related strains. This investment in our physical well-being translates to sustained focus and reduced fatigue. Breakout Areas and Relaxation Zones: Recognizing the importance of periodic rest, coworking spaces often feature comfortable lounges, quiet zones, and even outdoor areas where we can unplug, recharge, or engage in informal discussions. These spaces are crucial for mental refreshment and preventing burnout. Access to Amenities that Promote Well-being: Some advanced coworking spaces in Bahrain might even offer fitness facilities, wellness programs, or healthy food options on-site or nearby, further contributing to our overall health and productivity.\
\
Bahrain's compact geography and strategic intent to diversify its economy make the location of a business paramount. Coworking spaces often leverage this, placing themselves in prime areas. Central Business District (CBD) Presence & Prestige. Location is a powerful silent ambassador for any business.\
\
Establishing a presence in a prestigious address within Bahrain automatically confers a degree of credibility. Enhanced Business Image: Having an address in a prominent business district or a well-known commercial tower, even through a coworking arrangement, immediately elevates our business image. This can be particularly impactful when dealing with international clients or partners who associate prime locations with stability and success. Convenience for Clients and Partners: Central locations are typically well-served by public transport (where applicable) and road networks, making it easier for clients, investors, and team members to access our workspace. This convenience reflects positively on our professionalism.\
\
Proximity to Key Services: Being situated in a CBD also means we are often close to banks, government offices, legal firms, and other essential business services, streamlining our operational logistics. Ease of Access and Commutability. In a bustling urban environment, minimizing commute times & ensuring easy access are not just conveniences; they are competitive advantages. Reduced Commute Times: Many coworking spaces are strategically located near major residential areas or transport arteries, reducing the burden of long commutes for our team members.\
\
This contributes to better work-life balance and sustained employee satisfaction. Parking Solutions: While parking can be a perennial challenge in dense urban centers, many coworking spaces offer dedicated parking facilities or validate parking, alleviating a common stress point for daily commuters and visitors alike. Walkable Amenities: The best coworking locations in Bahrain often boast a plethora of surrounding amenities – restaurants, cafes, retail outlets, & sometimes even fitness centers – all within walking distance, adding convenience and vibrancy to our workday. For businesses, especially those new to Bahrain, the administrative burden of setting up operations can be formidable.\
\
Coworking spaces offer a streamlined path, helping us navigate the regulatory maze with greater ease. Streamlined Business Registration and Licensing. The initial steps of establishing a business in Bahrain involve a series of regulatory hurdles. Coworking providers often simplify this process.\
\
Virtual Office and Registered Address: A key requirement for business registration in Bahrain is a physical address. Coworking spaces commonly offer virtual office services, providing us with a legitimate registered address necessary for obtaining our Commercial Registration (CR). This is a foundational step many businesses struggle with independently. Assistance with Local Regulations: Some coworking providers offer guidance or even direct assistance with aspects of business setup, including liaising with relevant ministries or agencies. This institutional knowledge can be invaluable, helping us avoid common pitfalls and expedite the setup process. Flexibility with Legal Structures: Whether we are setting up as a Sole Proprietorship, a Small & Medium Enterprise (SME), or a branch of an international corporation, coworking spaces can accommodate various legal structures by providing the necessary physical presence and administrative support.\
\
Operational Support and Administrative Convenience. Beyond initial setup, ongoing administrative tasks can detract from our core business activities. Coworking spaces offer a robust layer of support. IT Support and Infrastructure Management: We are freed from the responsibility of managing our own IT infrastructure. Coworking spaces typically provide robust and secure internet, network management, and often on-site IT support, ensuring our technological backbone is always stable.\
\
This saves us from having to hire dedicated IT personnel or troubleshoot technical issues ourselves. Administrative Tasks & Concierge Services: Beyond basic reception functions, some coworking spaces go further, offering concierge-style services that can include everything from arranging couriers to booking travel, freeing up our valuable time to focus on strategic initiatives. Simplified Procurement: The need to procure office supplies, negotiate cleaning contracts, or manage utility providers is often absorbed by the coworking operator. This simplification of operational tasks allows us to channel our energy & resources into our primary business objectives, rather than getting mired in logistical details. It's like having a well-oiled machine for all the necessary, but non-core, aspects of running an office.\
\
In conclusion, our exploration of coworking spaces in Bahrain reveals a compelling proposition. It is more than just shared desk space; it is a strategic business decision that encompasses financial prudence, fosters innovation through community, boosts productivity, leverages prime locations, and simplifies regulatory navigation. As Bahrain continues its trajectory as a prominent business destination, we believe that the adoption of coworking models will only intensify, offering a dynamic and adaptable solution for businesses seeking to thrive in this vibrant market. .\

It’s like having a mental airlock that separates our professional & personal spheres.\

1qkvygi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtheistExperience/comments/1qkvygi/slavery/,Slavery,"Hey folks,

I wanted to spark a thoughtful discussion on something that’s struck me as profoundly hypocritical in our society: the idea that owning human beings is inherently wrong. We all nod along to human rights declarations banning slavery and servitude outright, but if we look closer, our everyday systems are riddled with contradictions that make this position feel downright disingenuous—and honestly, a bit alarming. Let’s break it down in a straightforward way, like we’re unpacking this over a formal coffee chat.

To start, consider the foundation of “self-ownership”—the principle that you control your own body, work, and choices, as philosophers like John Locke laid out centuries ago. Yet, governments routinely claim partial ownership through things like taxation. In the U.S., for instance, federal rates take 10% to 37% of your earnings, enforced by penalties up to imprisonment. Thinkers like Murray Rothbard have called this “partial slavery,” where the state owns a slice of your labor without true consent. We condemn private ownership as evil, but when it’s the government for “societal benefit,” it’s suddenly acceptable? That selective logic is what makes it hypocritical.

Then there’s compulsory service, like military drafts. In nations such as South Korea, young men must serve 18-21 months; in Israel, it’s up to 32 months. This treats citizens as state assets, deployable at a whim. We dress it up as “civic duty,” but it’s ownership in practice. The inconsistency here is scary—it normalizes control under noble labels, eroding the freedoms we claim to uphold.

Shifting to family dynamics, parents hold extensive authority over children: decisions on education, health, and even relocation, all backed by laws like U.S. custody statutes. It’s framed as guardianship, but it functions as temporary ownership, especially since minors can’t consent. This echoes historical justifications for slavery, where “protection” was the excuse. Globally, the International Labour Organization reports 160 million children in hazardous work, often under parental oversight. We decry ownership abstractly, yet institutionalize it at home—why the blind spot? It’s a double standard that perpetuates hidden power imbalances.

In the economic realm, wage labor under capitalism subtly mirrors this. Employers control your time and output during hours, with contracts enforcing rules like non-competes. Karl Marx critiqued this as veiled exploitation, where you’re “free” to sell your labor but end up commodified. In the gig economy—think Uber or similar platforms—algorithms monitor you like property, and studies show workers earn about 58% less after expenses. If human ownership is truly wrong, why tolerate corporate versions of it? This hypocrisy sustains inequality, keeping systems in place that benefit the powerful.

Finally, bioethical issues add another layer. Debates over reproductive rights assert bodily autonomy, but laws in places like Texas impose societal claims via bounties on abortion providers. Commercial surrogacy, legal in parts of the U.S. at $30,000–$50,000 per arrangement, essentially rents out human functions. If ownership is immoral, why commodify bodies this way? It raises chilling prospects for future tech, like owning genetic material, reminiscent of dystopian tales.

In essence, our blanket rejection of human ownership rings hollow because we allow it through governments, families, economies, and emerging tech—only vilifying the overt forms. This inconsistency is frightening; it masks ongoing oppressions while we pat ourselves on the back. For real progress, we need intellectual honesty: either oppose all coercive control or acknowledge the nuances.

What do you all make of this? Does it resonate, or am I missing something? Looking forward to your perspectives in the comments.

1qkvr27,https://i.redd.it/nookfy7in4fg1.png,"I'm 16 and built an iPad browser that hit #1 in the US, UK and Canada in 5 days. Here's everything.","**DISCLOSURE: I used AI to polish the writing of this post to make it easier to understand and follow, because why not? All the content and thoughts are entirely mine. If you don't want to read it, don't.**

Built [Beam Browser](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/beam-browser/id6756218494) solo over 2.5 months. It's a browser for iPad with sidebar tabs, spaces, command bar, keyboard shortcuts - basically the Arc/Zen experience that doesn't exist on iPad.

**9 days in:**

* 804 downloads
* $3,185 net proceeds
* \#1 US, #2 UK/Canada (Productivity, iPad Paid)
* Was #1 in US, UK, Canada, and Netherlands simultaneously for 4 days
* 4.7 stars, 38 ratings
* Digital Trends wrote about it

Here's everything that I did.

I didn't do market research. I use my iPad as my main computer, I wanted an Arc-style browser, it didn't exist. So I built it.

The gap exists because most devs treat iPad as an afterthought - either a stretched iPhone app or just ignored entirely. Very few people build iPad-first. But there's a growing number of people using iPad as their actual computer, and they're underserved.

Arc getting discontinued helped. Browser Company got acquired by Atlassian, Arc development stopped. Everyone who loved Arc suddenly had nowhere to go - especially on iPad where it never existed in the first place.

Everyone told me the audience was too niche. ""How successful can you be with such a specific product?""

Here's the thing: niche audiences convert.

When I posted on [r/ArcBrowser](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcBrowser/), I didn't need to explain why a sidebar browser was good. They already knew. They already wanted it. They were frustrated it didn't exist.

60% of my downloads come from App Store Search - people actively searching terms like ""arc browser ipad"", ""sidebar browser"". They have intent. They're not browsing, they're hunting.

I'd rather have 200 users who love Beam than 2,000 who think it's fine.

I didn't go all-in from day one. I escalated as validation increased.

First post was a screenshot of the MVP. Buggy as hell, barely any features, but you could see the concept. 100 people joined the waitlist. I started taking it more seriously.

200 on waitlist - spending money on tools, working every evening.

300+ waiting - Christmas holidays hit, I went all-in. 10+ hour days.

The first time I saw strangers discussing Beam on MacPowerUsers forum, during beta, was one of the best feelings. That's validation you can't fake.

Then came acquisition offers. Within days of launch, people wanted to buy Beam - offers around $20-30k. I turned them all down. But if people are offering to buy something days after launch, you've probably built something real.

I use Beam every day for hours. This matters more than I expected.

You never run out of ideas - every time I browse and think ""I wish I could..."" becomes a feature. You make better tradeoffs because you're building for yourself, not abstract users. You don't ship garbage because you're the one suffering when quality is low.

If you're thinking about building an app, build something you personally want badly. Not something you think will sell.

$4.99 one-time. No subscription.

If I was maximising revenue, I'd probably do a subscription or freemium. Instead I thought: what would I want to pay? I hate subscriptions for apps I don't use daily. So that's what I charged.

This ""left money on the table"" but built something better: a community that roots for me. Beta testers reported bugs religiously, were understanding when things broke, left genuine reviews on launch day. One person emailed saying ""I want to support your work"" - not ""I want features.""

Is this sustainable forever? Probably not. I'll figure out long-term monetisation later. For launch, it was the right call.

Also have donations via Buy Me a Coffee which some users have been generous with.

TestFlight was a secret weapon.

250+ beta testers over 2 months, all free. This gave me:

* An email list with 70%+ open rates (500+ emails by launch)
* Real testimonials I used on App Store screenshots
* Bugs found that I never would have hit
* Launch day reviews from people who already knew the app was good

I kept private beta small at first - asked \~200 waitlist people to email me if interested. About 30 took the time. That friction was intentional. These 30 people found countless bugs and shaped the core experience.

In early December I set launch date: January 13th. The browser wasn't ready. Lots of bugs, missing features. But I committed anyway.

Without a deadline, projects drag forever. There's always one more feature, one more bug. The deadline forced me to prioritise: what actually needs to work for launch?

Ship whatever you have on the date you set. It won't be perfect. Mine wasn't.

**The thing I didn't expect:**

At launch, I was expecting power users. People who already use Arc or Zen on desktop. People who'd understand the sidebar-first approach immediately.

What I didn't expect was hitting #1 in multiple countries and getting a wave of mainstream users who had never seen this browser layout before. They downloaded because it was top of the charts, not because they knew what Arc/Zen was.

This caused problems. Got a 1-star review saying it's ""unintuitive"" and needs a manual. Fair feedback honestly - Beam works completely differently to Safari/Chrome, and I launched without sufficiently detailed onboarding or any video tutorials. I wasn't expecting to need it straight away.

Now I'm working hard on proper onboarding, a help center, and tutorial videos. The Arc/Zen crowd understood immediately. Mainstream users need more help, and I should have planned for that even if I didn't expect it.

**What didn't work:**

Product Hunt timing disaster. Scheduled PH for Jan 13, submitted to App Store on Sunday evening before Monday launch. Way too tight.

Apple rejected me Monday morning for business model questions. PH went live pointing to a landing page instead of the App Store. Got 90 upvotes, then died. By the time Apple approved me Tuesday, momentum was gone.

Submit to App Store 3 weeks before launch. Not 2 days.

Apple Search Ads - set up £120 campaign, zero impressions after a week. Still not working. If anyone knows why a new Apple Ads account might get zero impressions even with Search Match on and decent bids, I'd appreciate the help.

Last-minute refactoring - did code cleanup days before launch, introduced new bugs. Shipped v1.1 a few days later to fix everything. Don't refactor before launch. Ship what works, clean up later.

**App Store rejections (2 times):**

1. ""iPad"" in name - Apple doesn't allow device names
2. Background audio entitlement I wasn't using
3. Age rating flag - actually set correctly, had to explain
4. Business model questions - wanted detailed explanation of why no IAP

Each cost 1-2 days. Build in buffer time.

**The press snowball:**

Digital Trends found Beam through the App Store, asked me questions, published ""I found an iPad browser that finally puts a desktop-like experience on Apple's tablet.""

Within hours, 5+ sites aggregated it. Perplexity AI created a summary and pushed notifications to users. DAU spiked from <100 to 275.

One article from a reputable source becomes: Google ranking, AI tool citations, aggregator content, newsletter fodder. Chart position attracts press, press drives downloads, downloads maintain chart position. The hard part is getting initial momentum.

**Community:**

Discord server with \~45 members - some asking to test early builds, which is a great sign. Reddit subreddit ([r/beambrowser](https://www.reddit.com/r/beambrowser/)) with \~90 members.

The Discord was small but intense during beta. Only about 12 active people, but they used Beam as their actual daily browser. Found bugs I never would have hit. When something broke, they told me within hours.

**Tools & costs:**

Development:

* Claude Max - £180/mo (yes it's a lot, but the speed improvement is worth it)
* Apple Developer - £79/yr

Infrastructure:

* Supabase for database and in-app feedback (moving to Plain now)
* Plain for support - started getting 10-15 emails a day and needed proper tooling
* Google Workspace - £5/mo for professional email
* Namecheap for domain
* Vercel for website hosting (free)
* Vite for website code

Marketing/design:

* [shots.so](http://shots.so/) for App Store screenshot mockups
* Canva for putting designs together
* Buy Me a Coffee for donations

Analytics:

* PostHog for in-app analytics
* Google Search Console
* Vercel analytics

Already profitable after week 1.

**SEO paid off:**

One benefit of the waitlist period - I've been ranked #1 for ""beam browser"" on Google consistently for weeks now, even before launch.

At moment of writing: 700 Google Search clicks total, and 1,635 website visitors in the last 7 days alone.

If anyone has tips on improving App Store conversion rate (currently around 1.1-1.5%), I'd love to hear them. Is that normal for a paid productivity app?

I'm doing A-levels. Launch was during term time. Christmas holidays I went hard - 10+ hour days. January with school back is much slower.

Since I'm under 18, I can't have Apple Developer account in my own name. It's under my dad's name (Jagjit Singh) on the listing. Causes occasional confusion but whatever.

**Current situation:**

* v1.1 shipped with fixes
* Working on v1.2 with peek, website dark mode, reader mode, AI improvements
* iPhone and Mac planned for this year
* Turned down $20-30k acquisition offers
* Still #1 US after 5+ days
* Balancing with A-levels

**If you're building something:**

Find a gap where people are actively looking for a solution. Embrace the niche - a tiny passionate audience beats a huge indifferent one. Let validation guide your investment - don't go all-in on day one. Set a deadline and ship whatever you have. Build something you'll use every day. Don't optimise for money early. Find your community before you build. Use TestFlight properly - it's not just testing, it's email collection, testimonials, and validation. Ship fast, iterate faster.

And plan for success even if you don't expect it. I didn't have onboarding ready because I assumed only power users would find it. Then it hit #1 and suddenly I needed to explain the whole concept to people who'd never heard of Arc.

Happy to answer questions. And if you've dealt with Apple Search Ads issues or have conversion rate tips, I'd love to hear them.

Here's everything.","**DISCLOSURE: I used AI to polish the writing of this post to make it easier to understand and follow, because why not? All the content and thoughts are entirely mine. If you don't want to read it, don't.** 

Built [Beam Browser](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/beam-browser/id6756218494) solo over 2.5 months. It's a browser for iPad with sidebar tabs, spaces, command bar, keyboard shortcuts - basically the Arc/Zen experience that doesn't exist on iPad.

**9 days in:**

* 804 downloads
* $3,185 net proceeds
* \#1 US, #2 UK/Canada (Productivity, iPad Paid)
* Was #1 in US, UK, Canada, and Netherlands simultaneously for 4 days
* 4.7 stars, 38 ratings
* Digital Trends wrote about it

Here's everything that I did. 



I didn't do market research. I use my iPad as my main computer, I wanted an Arc-style browser, it didn't exist. So I built it.

The gap exists because most devs treat iPad as an afterthought - either a stretched iPhone app or just ignored entirely. Very few people build iPad-first. But there's a growing number of people using iPad as their actual computer, and they're underserved.

Arc getting discontinued helped. Browser Company got acquired by Atlassian, Arc development stopped. Everyone who loved Arc suddenly had nowhere to go - especially on iPad where it never existed in the first place.



Everyone told me the audience was too niche. ""How successful can you be with such a specific product?""

Here's the thing: niche audiences convert.

When I posted on r/ArcBrowser, I didn't need to explain why a sidebar browser was good. They already knew. They already wanted it. They were frustrated it didn't exist.

60% of my downloads come from App Store Search - people actively searching terms like ""arc browser ipad"", ""sidebar browser"". They have intent. They're not browsing, they're hunting.

I'd rather have 200 users who love Beam than 2,000 who think it's fine.



I didn't go all-in from day one. I escalated as validation increased.

First post was a screenshot of the MVP. Buggy as hell, barely any features, but you could see the concept. 100 people joined the waitlist. I started taking it more seriously.

200 on waitlist - spending money on tools, working every evening.

300+ waiting - Christmas holidays hit, I went all-in. 10+ hour days.

The first time I saw strangers discussing Beam on MacPowerUsers forum, during beta, was one of the best feelings. That's validation you can't fake.

Then came acquisition offers. Within days of launch, people wanted to buy Beam - offers around $20-30k. I turned them all down. But if people are offering to buy something days after launch, you've probably built something real.



I use Beam every day for hours. This matters more than I expected.

You never run out of ideas - every time I browse and think ""I wish I could..."" becomes a feature. You make better tradeoffs because you're building for yourself, not abstract users. You don't ship garbage because you're the one suffering when quality is low.

If you're thinking about building an app, build something you personally want badly. Not something you think will sell.



$4.99 one-time. No subscription.

If I was maximising revenue, I'd probably do a subscription or freemium. Instead I thought: what would I want to pay? I hate subscriptions for apps I don't use daily. So that's what I charged.

Just propagation of constraint through contact.

You drop a calm, repeatable signal into a noisy medium…
and suddenly the noise has to decide what to do with itself.

If you want the clean version:
It’s not a quantum signal.

Already profitable after week 1.



**SEO paid off:**

One benefit of the waitlist period - I've been ranked #1 for ""beam browser"" on Google consistently for weeks now, even before launch.

At moment of writing: 700 Google Search clicks total, and 1,635 website visitors in the last 7 days alone.

If anyone has tips on improving App Store conversion rate (currently around 1.1-1.5%), I'd love to hear them. Is that normal for a paid productivity app?



I'm doing A-levels. Launch was during term time. Christmas holidays I went hard - 10+ hour days. January with school back is much slower.

Since I'm under 18, I can't have Apple Developer account in my own name. It's under my dad's name (Jagjit Singh) on the listing. Causes occasional confusion but whatever.



**Current situation:**

* v1.1 shipped with fixes
* Working on v1.2 with peek, website dark mode, reader mode, AI improvements
* iPhone and Mac planned for this year
* Turned down $20-30k acquisition offers
* Still #1 US after 5+ days
* Balancing with A-levels



**If you're building something:**

Find a gap where people are actively looking for a solution. Embrace the niche - a tiny passionate audience beats a huge indifferent one. Let validation guide your investment - don't go all-in on day one. Set a deadline and ship whatever you have. Build something you'll use every day. Don't optimise for money early. Find your community before you build. Use TestFlight properly - it's not just testing, it's email collection, testimonials, and validation. Ship fast, iterate faster.

And plan for success even if you don't expect it. I didn't have onboarding ready because I assumed only power users would find it. Then it hit #1 and suddenly I needed to explain the whole concept to people who'd never heard of Arc.



Happy to answer questions. And if you've dealt with Apple Search Ads issues or have conversion rate tips, I'd love to hear them.

No viral post.

No engagement surge.

No reason.

Just a perfectly timed turnaround ending in a +194 follower jump after a week of hemorrhaging. That’s not organic growth that’s panic buying wrapped in wishful thinking.

Real creators don’t flatline, then magically resurrect on a schedule. Audiences don’t leave in droves and then politely return because vibes improved. This pattern screams manipulation, not momentum.
