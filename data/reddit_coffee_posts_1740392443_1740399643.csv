‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

As the title says, I‚Äôve lost 40lbs (3 stone) in the last 7 months, and therefore I just wanted to share some of my observations and learnings in hope they may help others. This post may end up a little lengthy but I‚Äôll try to keep things as concise as I can.

___Background / context___

For context I‚Äôm 36, F, 5.2‚Äù. SW in July 24 was 218lbs+ and current weight is 176lbs, total lost 42lbs. I have been ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù since my early teens. In college (age 17-18) I was around 150lbs and in my early 20s I was around 160lbs. Around the age of 24/25 my weight had increased significantly to around 200lbs and I decided I had to do something about it, so I set about ‚Äúeating healthy‚Äùand using meal replacement shakes,  started to exercise and I lost about 30lbs. After around 4-5 months I slipped back to old ways and gradually gained the weight back. Once again around age 32 I decided I had to lose weight and so this time I tried the Keto diet as I had heard good things about it for quick weight loss - I stuck to it for around 4-5 months again, lost 20lbs and then again fell back into old ways. Weight piled back on due to depression, PCOS and a myriad of excuses I made for myself. Fast forward to July 24, 218lbs+ I was 36, living with chronic pain, poor mobility, terrible anxiety and despised myself. I decided enough was enough.

___How I‚Äôve lost the weight___

Very simply, CICO and eating in a deficit as well as eating Keto. After the short lived success I had with Keto a few years ago, and the memory of how good I had felt whilst doing it, I decided to try again - however (most importantly) this time I took the time to properly educate myself around Keto, diet, nutrition and what actually goes into our food and why it matters! With all the aches, pains and generally poor quality of life I was experiencing, I made the decision that this is a ‚Äúlifestyle‚Äù and not a diet or a means to lose weight - this isn‚Äôt for vanity, it‚Äôs for health.

I lost the first 20lbs between July and September 24, strictly through diet. In general I started moving more and I became much less lazy. I didn‚Äôt incorporate any exercise until January this year however. I now go to the gym focussing on strength training 3 times a week, now increasing to 4 times a week with a focus on compound exercises and progress overload. I don‚Äôt do any cardio, I get around 5k steps a day currently and plan to start trying for 8-10k as I now have a walking pad at home. I‚Äôm absolutely far from perfect and have occasional days where I don‚Äôt eat Keto, or eat over my calorie goal but the next day I just get back to it. I still plan to lose another 20 - 30 lbs, the weight loss has dramatically slowed down over the last 2 months and I‚Äôve only lost 2lbs since the start of January but I can see and feel changes in my body. My goal is to lose around 10lbs+ by July this year.

___Observations and advice____

- Do not treat your weight as a vanity only issue, it‚Äôs so incredibly important to take care of your health first and foremost and let the appearance changes from weight loss be a bonus! I truly believe coming to this realisation has helped me come as far as I have on my journey and still have motivation and desire to continue. 
- Being healthy is hard. There‚Äôs going to be so many days where you feel like quitting because it‚Äôs hard, very hard. But so is being unhealthy, pick your hard and make the choice that is going to overall improve your quality of life.
- Educate yourself. Read up on what you‚Äôre eating, understand what goes into your body and why this is important, I truly can‚Äôt stress this enough! Can you lose weight while still eating junk food? Yes! But should you? Ideally not‚Ä¶this isn‚Äôt intended as a lecture but hopefully an eye opener to people who (like me until recently) had very little awareness of this issue. I would recommend anybody who hasn‚Äôt done so to go and read Ultra Processed People by Chris van Tulleken - this book alone helped me to completely change my attitude towards food. Now I can look at a cookie, understand what it contains and how it impacts my body and make an educated decision on if I want to eat it (sometimes I do and that‚Äôs ok!).
- Treat the changes you make as a lifestyle. This change in mindset did wonders for me personally as it allows me breathing room for days where I may eat over my calorie goal, I might eat none-Keto because it‚Äôs a friend‚Äôs birthday or I‚Äôm sick and desperately want some comfort food! These days are ok, as long as they‚Äôre a rarity! Nobody is perfect and you don‚Äôt need to be, you just need to be consistent. I aim for a 80/20 approach and have found this works so well for me. 80% of the food I eat is whole food, with very few ingredients and the other 20% is things like sugar free coffee syrup, seasoned pork rinds and foods that I know have been processed. I also follow the 80/20 guide for my general diet when it comes to eating within my calorie goal or eating Keto. There is no finish line here, so allow yourself to live life while making good choices, most of the time!
- Take LOTS of progress pictures. It‚Äôs going to be very difficult to see the difference some days and you will need these pictures to remind you of how far you have come and why you are on your journey. 
- Be patient and treat yourself with kindness and respect. It‚Äôs extremely easy to compare yourself to others, or be your own worst critic (I speak from experience) but please be kind to yourself! Losing weight is physically and mentally extremely difficult and looks differently for everybody - take the time to reflect on positive changes you have made and in how you feel and no matter how slowly, just keep going.
- Preparation matters. I‚Äôm not saying you have to prep your meals for the week or plan a month in advance, but simple things like making sure there‚Äôs something on hand you can grab if hungry that will stop you making a negative choice will make a big difference in the long run. I don‚Äôt personally meal prep but I do like to have a general idea of what I have in the cupboard/fridge so I know ‚Äúwhen I get home from work I have some chicken breast to cook for dinner‚Äù. The chances are if I got home to an empty fridge, tired and hungry, I‚Äôll be on Uber Eats!
- Stop treating food as a reward. I‚Äôm a recovering emotional eater, and food to me has always been a pleasure, and always will be - I love food and I enjoy eating. That said, food is an energy source for our bodies, it is not a reward or something to be used for comfort. This is a harsh statement but I believe a necessary mindset and understanding to have. You can absolutely enjoy food and you should, but please learn to treat it for what it is - energy for your body. Food addiction is real and you can overcome it through educating yourself. 

I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a lot more I can add to the list but these are the major things that have helped me. I‚Äôm more than happy to answer any questions if there are any and I genuinely hope this helps at least one person.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
TLDR:
Lost 42lbs in 7 months with eating in a deficit on Keto. Treating this as a lifestyle not a quick win diet. Educate yourself about food, what goes in it and why this is important. Be kind to yourself, be patient - it takes hard work but it‚Äôs worth it.",1,1740399456.0,WeightLossAdvice,0,1.0,False
1ix0or5,https://i.redd.it/torda2y1x2le1.jpeg,My Headcanons/ My Alternate Timeline of River Republic,"(WARNING: These headcanons can be more considered ""alternate timeline"" than imaginating being canon to the current EAW lore. Its not entirely intended to fully make sense with the creators' intentions, despite following the EAW timeline in Wiki GG)

- Nova gets easily drunk after two cups of coffee

- River has a habit of biting pens (her trademark object) when too focused

- Nova is 32 and River is 42

- Nova joined the main party in May 1003 after being in communist youth club and the provincial communist party branch of the Industrial Rijekograd. Joined parliament in March 1004 to replace a deputy and got quickly voted as party leader in November/December 1004 after being the only one that managed to get under River's skin (The start of a rivalry)

- Before Nova, the Communist Party was between 10% and 17% of popularity in a stagnation era.

- The Communist Party was initially formed as a progressive party called Red River after its founder Fountain Marvel was shunned by the harmony party and split from it in 970

- It got a surge of popularity until 982 after 
the snap election of 971, the elections of 975 and 979 and the snap election of 981 where the party managed to get support enough for the harmonist party to need the Red River to tolerate their government, which lead to Fountain officially embrace the communist ideas he grew inspired in 980 due to similar ideas to his party, renaming to the Communist League. Then, in 982, Fountain dies due to an accident

- The Communist Party falls appart after the vice-general secretary and ultra-hardiner Cake Bloom took over and destroyed the toleration agreement with the harmonist party by refusing to negotiate which punished a lot in the snap election of 982, with Cake ousted after everyone in the party openly shunning him and interim leader announcing quick leadership elections.

- Despite another snap elections in 985, the Communist League had a hard time to get the same revelance in the Golden Era of Fountain, with the hardliners, despite shunning the ultra hardliner Cake, having reputation damaged

- Caramel Maze surged in popularity in 1002 as the biggest face in the hardliner faction, presenting as an anti-revisionist. However, in secret, he's a ultra hardliner anti-revisionist like Cake, only disliking Cake due to Cake being idiot for sticking with democracy rather than revolution

- Nova planned to run for party leadership and Sabor Elections of 1005 with Tara Steam, hardliner too but also a best friend that colaborated tightly with Nova. However, the majority of the hardliners faction forced Nova to have Caramel as running mate to get their support.

- River had joined the harmonist party in 997 but her main job was being a teacher until she got convinced to run for leadership elections in 999 where, thanls to her charisma and refreshing ideas for the harmonist party lead to her becoming chancellor in 1001

- River's first vice-chancellor had left after a year due to health complications, leading to River appoint Hector Vippazin, Field Marshal and Uncle (and father figure) of River. Nepotism accusations avoided due to Hector being part of previous governments.

- River's parents died when River was 3, leading to Hector take care of her at the age of 25, with his girlfriend later wife, due to being River's guardian.

- Despite being 64 years old, Hector has a sharp mind. And, despite River being 42, Hector still calls her his ""kid"".

- Harmony Party is normally in coalition with Liberal and Progressive parties. It used to also ally with conservative parties but River, not being a fan of them, barely negotiated much with them and shunned any conservative party in her coalition in th 1005 elections

- River Republic has been the leader country of the River Coalition since the start of the coalition, winning constantly in the coalition leadership. There were brief periods where the country wasnt leader with Bakaran Republic, Wittenland and Lake City having their time to shine

I've found my main source of income which is around 10k an hour if I feel like doing it. But I settle for 5k a day which is 30min grind with my morning cup of coffee. For a beginner such as myself this feels solid and effortless almost. Like, I'm certain I make more gold than most newbies usually do. I'm sitting on comfortable 100k doing this specific grind for only a week and half consistently.

But I can't help but wonder whether I'm in a good spot or if I'm missing out on something insane such as 100k a day amount?

I don't talk to other players and I'm not aware of all the possibilities. I have no one to compare myself to to be able to tell whether my daily gold income is solid or actually sad lol.

I am afraid that If I misunderstand her chats as her dropping hints and go forward will telling her how I feel, it will probably ruin our friendship. What can I do here?","So, backstory

* Shes like drop dead pretty and her voice is really cute too, she IS what I would call a physical manifestation of my type of girl. She also gets proposals from many other guys and stuff. Every guy she chats with always ends up proposing to her. She has complained about this too.
* I had confessed to her back when we were 15 or so and we went on a single date
* I did EVERYTHING that was Humanly AND Inhumanly possible to keep her happy and encourage her. Had a fight with her parents? I was there to console her. Failed a test and crying? I was on call with her. One of her dog's puppies died? I spent 6hrs on call consoling her. Meanwhile I myself got scolded a lot by my parents and never told her anything in case she thought i was a p\*ssy (i heard some girls get turned off by that). Think of a thing and I have probably done that for her. I am probably ranting, so sorry for that.
* After that we had a fight on text (cuz exams and all, she studied a lot and was confused about herself and I wanted to feel a bit loved so i asked her to chat a bit more, my bad ik, I was tired of hard carrying the conversation all by myself). And because of that, we broke up (?).
* I spent countless days mourning and keeping myself contained, spent an entire year trying to forget her but she kept coming back to my mind everytime like some sort of cancer. Especially since I hadnt dated any girl after that breakup, every time I feel alone, she popped up in my head.

Fast forward to the present day scenario,

* I accidentally sent her a message on instagram like around jan 2025 and she replied and we started talking from then onwards.
* Then every emotion I had spent years packing up just came flooding in and broke every mental barrier that i had set about her. Everytime I listen to her voice, its like drinking a cup of coffee with 50 pounds of caffeine in it. My hearts starts beating faster than a jackhammer.
* Then she started saying stuff like ""Having relationships during adolescence is really a curse, That is immaturity at its peak"" and ""How would you compare my maturity from then with now"".
* Then she broke up with her BF around 1st Feb, and has been surprisingly chill about it. Like no ""He did this"" or ""He didnt do this"". Nothing. She usually talks about everything to me, but she didnt talk about this. Everytime i ask her questions about her breakup, she leaves me on read and only replied back when i ask something else.
* Oh and also, we got the same marks in a couple of tests and watch a lot of the same stuff, like we have a lot in common. But shes not the same type of freaky as me.
* She keeps saying stuff like ""Wow, getting same marks and now watching the same movie alone? This much cant be a coincidence?? Ngl.."" (she didnt write anything else)
* I sent her a message she found cute so she wrote ""You are so cute ngl"" and then ""i mean nerdy tall cute why didn't u get¬†a¬†gf"".
* I said that I tried but couldnt get anyone and then she proceeds to tell me how to ask out a girl and all.

I am so fucking confused at this point. I dont know what to do. She seems like a really nice girl who keeps getting asked out and I feel really bad for her tbh. She cant get a normal person to talk to without them asking her out. Do I become that normal guy she wants to talk to or go ahead with confessing my real feelings to her.  
I am really really sorry if this post breaks any rules, I just dont know who/where else I could ask this question at. My dad hates this kind of stuff and asks me to focus of studying, my friends would make fun of me if they came to know that I simp so hard after a girl and I dont have any siblings.  
Its just me all alone left to drown in my feelings and its burning a hole inside me that I dont know how to fill.",1,1740398800.0,RelationshipIndia,1,1.0,False

1ix0ewq,https://www.reddit.com/r/newborns/comments/1ix0ewq/new_mummas/,New mummas,"I feel like I never had anyone give me specifics for newborn, maybe they just all forget how overwhelming all the things you need to buy are. A friend of mine just told me she is pregnant so I made her a little list & thought I would share it too. (I‚Äôm from Australia so apologies for the specific brands/stores)

Second hand clothing!! People post in mums groups really cheap clothes - some with tags still on. Be a sustainable queen ‚ù§Ô∏è
Baby bunting have 3 month lay-by‚Äôs, this helped so I could pick out everything, pay it off & pick it up when I was ready to set it all up. 
- [ ] Riff raff: comfort toy, it has a white noise machine in the head and honestly still the only thing to help Charlotte sleep (my number 1 purchase) 

- [ ] Baby food bible (for later but really interesting read to familiarise yourself with baby nutrition) 
- [ ] Julia Donaldson books (the best rhymes) - no other books compare, these are actually fun to read. 
- [ ] Oball (her first toy she could grab and play with) 

- [ ] Soft contrast book (babies can only see black and white for ages)

- [ ] Cellular blankets (so they don‚Äôt die if it gets over their mouth) 
- [ ] Sleep suits: from 3 months you need to have their arms out so they don‚Äôt roll and die, I have mine from ergo baby I really like them. The sleep suits fit from 3-12 months so you can get a few of these, I have 1.0, 2.5 tog. I find she sleeps much better in a thin long sleeve & a 2.5 tog & I keep the room at 20 degrees & a blanket just at her feet, tucked really tight so she can‚Äôt kick about and wake herself up.  
- [ ] Swaddles: bub hated having her arms pinned down, so ‚Äúlove to dream swaddles‚Äù - best. It holds their arms up but is nice and snug. (They can only be swaddled for 3 months so buy 1 newborn, 1 small to start) 

- [ ] Temperature egg- for bedtime, there are ‚ÄúTOG‚Äù ratings on clothes. This will help you dress them for bed for the weather. 

- [ ] Amazon bassinet on wheels the brand is ‚Äúlittle riders‚Äù, legit like $250 (sooo handy, it can follow you around the house while bub sleeps, it has adjustable heights, you can rock it side to side to help sooth, it‚Äôs a co sleeper, so you can attach it to your bed, and it‚Äôs heaps bigger than most bassinet‚Äôs so you can use it well past most so bub can be in your room the full 6 months next to you - I still wake up through the night and check she‚Äôs breathing lol
This also packs up super easy, we took it on a trip away and it was perfect. 

- [ ] 2 glass bottles (you might need them for formula, or you might pump, but glass bottles are better, but you don‚Äôt want to over buy if you don‚Äôt end up using them) I also brought a tin of formula just incase too. 
- [ ] Buy a dummie just in case but we never used one and she learnt other ways to sooth. If you breastfed you‚Äôre not suppose to give them a dummy for 4-6 weeks anyway. 
- [ ] Pants SUCK to take on and off babies, buy onsies, I really like bonds & the organic cotton ones from target (they have double zips) 
- Target have ones with little feet and fold over hands, baby babies scratch themselves flat out so you can fold over the hands to help. 
- [ ] Buy a pram that converts, the ones with ‚Äúbassinets‚Äù as additional parts $$, they‚Äôre in the bassinet for like 12 weeks then you‚Äôll never use it again (and a pram that you can add an additional seat too, incase you wanna get up the duff again) 
Also because mine converts, if she wants to take a nap, I can put it into bassinet mode and lie her down. 
- [ ] Car seat, I got the britax (safe & sound) just went for the most expensive assuming it was the safest (750, then it went on sale while it was still on layby for 550 and they knocked it down) I really like it! It will be used until she‚Äôs like 4 so it grows with the baby. 
- [ ] I got my rocking chair from ‚Äúmocka‚Äù SO comfy (baby spit up is white, so get a light colour, linen or beige) 
- [ ] Cot & mattress: also from Mocka, I brought a cot that turns into a toddler bed (it has two heights so when they can stand you can move it down) and you can buy a toddler attachment so you can covert it later. (And cheapppp compared to box stores) 
- [ ] Bouncer, any brand will do, try get one that sells the detachable bar with toys hanging. 
- [ ] High chair: I got an expensive one covered in material cause it looks so comfy but fuck me, the first time she tried food she covered it in pumpkin üòÇ get a cheapy easy to clean. Mine is also heavy as f**k to move around. 
- [ ] Change table: I got one from babyhood, it sits on top of the cot. I did this to save space in the room but also now she‚Äôs older and about to roll, WORST case she rolls off onto the cot mattress underneath. 
- [ ] Baby monitor I ended up spending like $450 because I was wanted one on a stand but it doesn‚Äôt really stand. It just sits by the cot and stands and attaches to the cot. It‚Äôs stupid. Don‚Äôt spend that much money on a monitor get one and just stick it on a wall.
- [ ]  Another one of my favourites was a mobile that attaches to the cot and I‚Äôve put that beside her changing table and for like the first 12 weeks she hated getting her nappy changed so I‚Äôd put that on and sing a little song and all of the pieces would turn and she loved watching it. I know that 12 weeks doesn‚Äôt sound like a lot but when you‚Äôre changing a newborn like 10 times a day who would just scream, it was a blessing. 
- [ ] Terry towling will still be one of my best purchases. It is like $25 for a pack of 10 and use them for everything. Use them to stick under their bum while you‚Äôre changing them so they don‚Äôt piss on you or on their clothes. You can use it for spit up. They‚Äôre great.
- [ ] Nappy bin get the biggest one you can find because again when you‚Äôre changing your newborn 10 times a day those nappies stack up don‚Äôt smell. I‚Äôve got the one from KORBELL. It has a liner that you don‚Äôt need to change for like 20 refills - it‚Äôs great. 
- [ ] Baby clothes, if it‚Äôs cute or very pretty it‚Äôs going to be a nightmare to take on and off. Sometimes breastfed babies don‚Äôt shit for like seven days which is crazy but they have 6 to 10 wet nappies every day.  Everything you buy think ‚Äúwill it be easy to get to their bum‚Äù
- [ ] Baby towels you don‚Äôt need them. Just use your own towels. They‚Äôre softer and thicker and honestly I could air dry her, she dries in like a minute. 
- [ ] Play gyms if I could take my time back, I would get something that wasn‚Äôt aesthetically pleasing even though it was a gift. I would get something that is colourful and bright and makes noises and that‚Äôs fun. 
- Buy fuck all newborn clothes - they‚Äôre in them for like a minute (or if you have a big baby, never) 
- Babies don‚Äôt need any soaps or wash, for ages (they only need 1 bath a week until they‚Äôre like 2 months) 
- Don‚Äôt buy a pump, until you know if you can breastfeed. (They‚Äôre spenny, but I like the wearable ones) 
- muscle mat I got this a little while ago so I could have something soft to play on the floor with bub. It‚Äôs like an inch thick. It‚Äôs stain resistant water resistant. I got the one in the farm pattern and I find it really sweet.
- Tummy time pillows I have one that‚Äôs super colourful that bub really likes and I‚Äôve got a round cylinder shape one. The round cylinder shape would be the best that she‚Äôs used. I just got this from baby bunting although she hated tummy time so I used to put dancing fruit on the TV and put a mat on the coffee table and sit her up on the coffee table and then she‚Äôd be mesmerised by the dancing fruit and that help with tummy time.
- Your milk won‚Äôt come in for a few days, when it does, you‚Äôll look like a pornstar. Try to feed as much as possible, this sets the standard for your milk production.  I try to pump in the morning so we can give her a bottle at night, I thought this was important experience for partner to be able to feed her, also you need your own sanity!! Go out for a lunch or dinner without having to take the baby with you. Sometimes babies will refuse a bottle if they have only had breast. So when you‚Äôre ready for daycare or a night away, you want to make sure they‚Äôll take a bottle. 

Hospital bag 
Honestly, I packed like I was a single mother. I packed absolutely everything that I thought that I could possibly need when realistically all I needed was pyjamas for me because I didn‚Äôt change into anything else, underwear for three days. I took in four suits for bub which I didn‚Äôt need but I took two premie and then two newborn. If you want to do an announcement photo shoot taking something cute that you wanna put bub in. Diapers for your baby and for you üòÇ. I bought women‚Äôs diapers and then I just chucked them in my bag not trying them on try them on because my fat arse especially pregnant got them too small so I ended up just wearing big pads. Just remember that hubby gonna go back-and-forth from Home every night so if you need anything extra or need him to go out and get something for you or the baby he can just go so just go with a backpack of stuff and don‚Äôt stress too much. Food, all I was able to stomach was cups of tea and lots of ham and cheese sandwiches. ",2,1740398455.0,newborns,0,1.0,False
1ix0emx,https://v.redd.it/qcpys21pt2le1,Heating temperature problem [Quick Mill Pippa],"Hello! I just received my new Quick Mill Pippa last week but I have some problem with the water temperature. When I run the water in coffee mode, there is a lot of steam coming out (see video). Some detais of what I did in the video:

1. Turned the machine on, waited the heating light to turn off then waited around 2 minutes more. The machine was on for about 8 minutes total.

2. I notice that the pressure gauge is already showing 2 bars which is already odd to me.

3. Run the water, lot of steam coming out

4. Turn the steaming switch on, the heating light is not turning on, as if it was already at temperature to steam.

Am I doing something wrong or is it a defect and I need to return it? Has anyone encountered a similar problem?

One of the most popular benefits of coffee is its ability to aid in weight management. Caffeine is a well-known stimulant that increases metabolic rate, helping the body burn fat more efficiently. Additionally, coffee can stimulate thermogenesis, the process of heat production in the body, which further accelerates calorie burning.

* **Increased Calorie Burning**: Studies have shown that caffeine increases the body‚Äôs calorie burning by up to 11%.
* **Appetite Suppression**: Coffee can help control appetite, reducing food cravings and making it easier to maintain a healthy weight.

¬†

# 3. Lowers the Risk of Type 2 Diabetes

Drinking coffee regularly may help protect against type 2 diabetes. Coffee contains a variety of compounds, such as chlorogenic acids, that help improve insulin sensitivity and regulate blood sugar levels. Studies suggest that coffee drinkers have a significantly lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to non-coffee drinkers.

* **Improved Insulin Sensitivity**: Coffee helps the body process glucose more effectively, which is crucial for managing and preventing type 2 diabetes.
* **Lower Blood Sugar**: Consuming coffee regularly can stabilize blood sugar levels, reducing the risk of blood sugar spikes.

¬†

# 4. Protects Against Certain Types of Cancer

Coffee is a rich source of antioxidants, which play a key role in protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals. Studies suggest that drinking coffee may lower the risk of certain types of cancer, including liver, colorectal, and breast cancer.

* **Liver Cancer Prevention**: Research indicates that coffee drinkers have a 40% lower risk of developing liver cancer.
* **Breast Cancer Prevention**: Some studies suggest that coffee‚Äôs antioxidant-rich compounds may help lower the risk of breast cancer, particularly in women who are genetically predisposed to it.

¬†

# 5. Improves Physical Performance and Stamina

Caffeine is widely known for its ability to enhance physical performance. By stimulating the nervous system and increasing adrenaline levels, coffee can help improve exercise performance, especially in endurance activities.

* **Increased Energy Levels**: Caffeine helps release fatty acids from the body‚Äôs fat tissues, making them available for use as energy during exercise.
* **Better Performance**: Studies have shown that caffeine consumption improves athletic performance, especially in activities like running and cycling.

¬†

# 6. Supports Heart Health and Reduces Stroke Risk

Coffee has been shown to have protective effects on cardiovascular health. While there have been concerns about coffee raising heart rate, research indicates that moderate coffee consumption may lower the risk of heart disease and stroke in the long term.

* **Reduced Inflammation**: Coffee has natural anti-inflammatory properties that can help protect the heart and blood vessels.
* **Improved Circulation**: Coffee helps improve blood flow by dilating blood vessels, which may reduce the risk of heart-related issues like high blood pressure.

¬†

# 7. Enhances Mood and Mental Health

Coffee not only perks you up physically but also has mood-enhancing properties. It can help reduce feelings of depression and anxiety, as it stimulates the production of serotonin, the brain‚Äôs ""feel-good"" neurotransmitter.

* **Reduced Depression Symptoms**: Studies show that people who drink coffee regularly have a lower risk of depression.
* **Improved Mental Well-being**: Coffee‚Äôs mood-boosting effects can lead to a more positive outlook, improving mental health and overall happiness.

¬†

# 8. Promotes Liver Health and Reduces Fatty Liver Disease

Coffee has powerful detoxifying effects that help support liver function. Regular consumption of coffee has been shown to reduce the risk of liver disease, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

* **Reduced Risk of Fatty Liver**: Studies show that coffee drinkers have a lower incidence of fatty liver disease and liver cirrhosis.
* **Detoxification**: Coffee helps the liver detoxify by promoting the removal of harmful toxins from the body.

# FAQs About the Health Benefits of Coffee

**Q1: Can coffee really help me lose weight?**  
Yes, coffee can aid in weight loss by boosting metabolism and promoting fat burning. However, moderation is key‚Äîtoo much caffeine can have adverse effects.

**Q2: Is coffee good for your heart?**  
In moderation, coffee is good for your heart. It helps reduce inflammation and improve blood circulation, which lowers the risk of heart disease and stroke.

**Q3: Can coffee protect against cancer?**  
While coffee cannot completely prevent cancer, its antioxidant properties may help lower the risk of certain types of cancer, including liver and colorectal cancers.

The elevator doors whisked open, and Evann stepped out, removing his helmet. The tips of his blonde hair were flecked with beads of sweat and his face pale from the drying perspiration. As he rocked his lower jaw from side to side, he pinched his nose and blew to alleviate the pressure in his ears. It was always like this. As incredible as the power suit was, any extended amount of time in it meant a long, hot shower and a couple of cigarettes upon return.

‚ÄúStill have my report to make,‚Äù Evann muttered, desperate for the taste of tobacco as he marched through the hall of the executive floor, cracking his neck from side to side. The helmet remained tucked under his arm, chip held securely in place within the gear. He sniffed, then approached the large double doors at the end of the hall, knocking twice.

‚ÄúEnter,‚Äù a voice with a thick baritone came from within.

Evann pushed the door open and shut it behind him. Men and women sat in a half-circle of desks adorned with electronic pads and microphones. The room was without windows to maintain privacy, and the walls were made of a thick steel that could only be punctured by the most powerful of weaponry. The executives were clad in formal wear, bearing piercing eyes and rigid facial structures. They bore into him with their stares, the man at the very back setting his elbows on the desk and crossing his hands. There wasn‚Äôt a single person around these tables who was incapable of dismantling departments with a single phrase.

Offering a crisp salute, Evann put his free hand behind his back and stood at attention. He chose to stare at the Centurion banner against the wall behind them. It was customary that people in Evann‚Äôs position avoid looking into the eyes of one‚Äôs superior unless expressly told to do so. A Centurion custom, as he understood it.

‚ÄúWhat news do you bring, Andvari?‚Äù the man with the crossed hands asked. Each SPECTRE was expected to take on a codename upon their initiation. Evann had chosen the term, Andvari.

‚ÄúThe chip was successfully retrieved,‚Äù Evann said.

‚ÄúWas the information compromised?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is no history on file that the chip has been accessed.‚Äù

The man drew a long, sharp breath, slowly nodding. ‚ÄúSet the chip on the table.‚Äù

Evann stepped forward and extracted the chip from his helmet. He observed the chip momentarily before setting it down in front of the man. The president slid the chip closer and picked it up, rotating it in his hand and humming. ‚ÄúYou have done well, Andvari. Your contribution is to be commended.‚Äù

These meetings were always a conniving dance of shifting power. Despite his excellent performance and his prestigious position as a SPECTRE, he was still small fry when compared to the suits of Centurion. No amount of combat ability or wit could overthrow the word of Centurion‚Äôs executives and its other corporate partners.

‚ÄúThank you, sir,‚Äù Evann said, his attention still firmly glued to the banner. In these meetings, it was important he only spoke when spoken to, and that he avoided offering information that wasn‚Äôt asked for.

‚ÄúI shall see to it that you receive a bonus for your work,‚Äù the man continued, pulling his electronic pad closer. Evann glanced down without moving his head, impressed with the speed of the man‚Äôs fingers. Rumor had it that he had extensive work done on his hands to improve his speed and dexterity while reducing the strain and fatigue. Evann had his doubts, as the man‚Äôs hands displayed no scars or inhuman movements. Then again, cybernetic implants were improving every year. ‚ÄúReturn to your quarters and await further instructions. You are dismissed.‚Äù

Evann nodded and exited back through the double doors. He allowed his body to relax and shook his head. *I need a smoke.*

Wiping the sheen of sweat from his forehead, Evann returned to the elevator and took it down to the commons floor. When he stepped out, he took to the hall on his left, evading the security desk and pushing open the door to his quarters. Centurion policy was exceedingly strict about where Evann was allowed to go when wearing his suit. His quarters were a fine place to remove the suit, though it needed to be placed in a special container that ensured the suit was operating at full capacity.

After sliding his card through the reader and leaning forward for a retina scan, a chime followed, and the door slid open. ‚ÄúWelcome back, Evann,‚Äù an electronic female voice said.

Evann walked into the room and the door hissed shut behind him. The cigarette was calling his name, but there was still protocol to be followed before he could lounge around. He retrieved his pistol from the holster and switched on the safety to his gun before striding over to the rack of weapons on the wall. He set the gun in a slot that was level to the wall, and a green light came on above it. The light flickered to yellow moments later, indicating that the generator was being charged.

While weapons and armor were expected to be placed inside the secured room of the accompanying SPECTRE when not in use, Evann felt naked without his weapon, and so he preferred to keep his weapon where he could see it. Centurion rule dictated that any SPECTRE was allowed their weapon so long as they were present to observe it. He would be in direct violation of Centurion protocol the moment he left the room.

Drawing a deep breath, he stepped over to his side where another sliding door was. Beyond this one was the secured room where a cache of weapons and armor suitable to Centurion SPECTREs lay. Any attempt to break in would set off a silent alarm and initiate a secondary set of emergency locks that few had the knowledge to. He slipped his card through the reader and a loud click emanated from within. The door whisked open to reveal a small room with several black crates of weapons and suits with the Centurion logo.

Throwing open the crate to his right, he took off the body suit and carefully placed it inside the grooves next to the helmet. Once he shut the crate, a light came on where the handle was, turning green, then flickering to yellow just as his pistol had. With that out of the way, he exited the room and locked it through use of his card.

Striding over to the door to the back porch, he pushed it open and took a seat on one of the luxurious seats Centurion provided to their employees. State of the art stuff, it cushioned the person‚Äôs muscles and adjusted specifically for that person‚Äôs body type and weight. He sat down, flicked the switch on the side, and let the machine do its work while the rain pattered against the veranda.

He retrieved the pack of cigarettes and lighter from the glass table and tapped the packaging until a cigarette fell out. He lit the end, puffed on it, then set the lighter and pack back on the table, blowing a huff of smoke upward and leaning into the chair.

The AirVac machine hummed above him, drawing in poisonous fumes and unbreathable air and expelling it back into clean oxygen. It was a miracle of technology and ingenuity, taking what should‚Äôve been an unlivable environment and turning it into something that resembled the world before the Great War. Or, at least, a *shell* of something resembling the world as it was.

AirVac was what kept the world in check, complacent, obedient. It brought about law and order and allowed those at the top to ensure cooperation among the populace. Centurion‚Äîalongside its allies, Shinsei and Praetorian‚Äîworked to help maintain and balance life in Bastion. If not for their work, there was a good chance Evann would‚Äôve never been born at all, and the entirety of the human race would now be extinct.

*All because of some A.I.*

Evann flicked the ash off his cigarette as he mulled over the significance of A.I. from the world as it was. Nowadays, such a concept was expressly illegal and punishable by death. Rumors would float around from time to time that the big three corporations were inventing new methods for how the technology could better assist humanity so as to prevent a repeat of the prior disaster, but such rumors were ill-founded at best. Even if such a method could be found, Conrad‚Äîthe late founder of Praetorian, and a hero to Bastion‚Äîstood at the center of Bastion, immortalized in bronze as an everlasting reminder not to repeat the past.

Taking another puff on his cigarette, the lure vanished. It was always like this. Regardless of the stress he felt, the desire to take more than needed off of the blunt was never appealing to him. A few long drags and he‚Äôd be done, oftentimes discarding the remaining half in the tray. He put his cigarette in the ashtray and pressed the full weight of his thumb against it to extinguish the ashes, then flipped the switch off on the chair, then stepped back into his room when he was sure he wouldn‚Äôt take any of the smoke in with him.

¬†The sofa called to him, but the allure of the shower was stronger. His muscles desperately craved some relaxation and a decent show. Not that there was ever much to watch. Society was still working its way back up to creating entertainment. More people found their fun in building things, playing games, or going out for drinks. Television was a poor imitation of what it used to be, under exceptional scrutiny from the corporations. A strict set of rules had to be followed to end up on television, and even if it managed to get that far, chances were the show would be canceled within a year‚Äôs time. Oftentimes, long before that.

He slid his finger along the wall where the restroom‚Äôs entrance was, and a green light turned on behind the transparent finish. With a hiss, the wall folded itself into a compartment to reveal a sleek room of black marble and glass.

Evann undressed and threw his clothes onto the sink to his left. His room was as luxurious as it got, but it was still a studio at best. The restroom‚Äîif you could even call it that‚Äîwas slick and precise, hidden behind a wall like everything else. That was the theme behind Centurion‚Äôs make. If you couldn‚Äôt find it, then you knew they were proud of it.

The showerhead turned on at his approach, and he stepped over the ledge and into the compartment. A glass sliding door emerged from a slot in the wall, encasing him inside. Hot water drenched his sculpted body, finding its way into the gaps of his hair and skin. The tension left his body in waves, and a satisfied sigh escaped his lips.

‚ÄúEvann. You have a bonus awaiting you from Centurion Corp.,‚Äù the female voice assigned to his room said.

‚ÄúIgnore,‚Äù Evann said, washing his hair.

‚ÄúThe message is available at your convenience.‚Äù

Centurion had been kind with their bonuses up until now. Perhaps it was an incentive program of sorts or a way to encourage consistent behavior. From what his commander had told him, he displayed exceptional performance during missions, so as long as he was being paid it was all the same to him.

‚ÄúCancel shower,‚Äù Evann said.

The showerhead responded and the water stopped. With a sigh, he exited and began his usual hygiene routine. As much as he wanted to go back to his home, Centurion had been clear about his need to remain on standby until further notice. Whatever Centurion had cooked up for him was bad. Real bad. It was the third mission in as many days, and each of them was a reconnaissance task. The suits had been tight-lipped for the most part, but from what little he‚Äôd heard, someone within was leaking classified information out to the public.

‚ÄúRazor.‚Äù Moments after his request, a compartment opened up next to the mirror, revealing a razor that cost more than most people made in a month. He retrieved it and set to work on shaving the stubble.

Considering Centurion‚Äôs inconsistency regarding his dismissal upon capture, he figured each of the chips he‚Äôd retrieved up until now were important in different ways. Whether that was weapons, conspiracies, or otherwise, he couldn‚Äôt say for sure. Though, whoever was distributing this information knew how to cover their tracks.

Centurion was home to some of the best hackers and programmers in all of Bastion. He was no slouch himself, even if his SPECTRE duties often found him in the line of combat more often than not. As far as he understood it, Shinsei and Praetorian weren‚Äôt suffering from the same issues. Allegedly.

When Evann was done, he shut off the systems through a number of voice commands and slipped into his boxer shorts and a loose-fitting T-shirt. The half-circle sofa was calling his name, and he made no effort to refuse the call. After he retrieved his gun from the charging station on the wall, he jumped over the back and landed on the soft material, clicking on the television for any semblance of entertainment. He stopped when he landed a history channel detailing the events of the Great War, then set his gun on the marble coffee table, making doubly sure that the safety was turned off.

He nestled into a comfortable position, and sleep took him shortly after.

The babe is employed but doesn't earn that much and lives in Mlolongo. We set the date for Saturday at 4pm

a) pay the driver on arrival.
b) order from my phone since my uber is linked to card.

The baby girl flips out on me and tells me i have trust issues and i should just send her the money. But remember, I've never met this person in my life and all our interactions thus far have been online.

At which point i start to feel frustrated and tell her not to come and decided to take myself out on the date... but my only question is what is the difference between ordering the ride for the person and sending them the money?

They arrived at 6 PM, and his two older kids immediately started eating all the noodles, followed by my brother-in-law. They ate everything, and then asked me to cook more because they were still hungry. I ignored this request.

I served the two younger kids, but my brother-in-law insisted I spoon-feed them because they're ""not used to sitting down to eat"" and he was ""too busy eating."" I ignored that request as well.

They then asked for ice cream, which I gave them. His two younger kids made a mess of my son's toys, which I had to clean up because my brother-in-law didn't.

He then left, leaving his two younger kids behind to finish their dinner, saying his wife was home resting and he wanted to shower.

We called my father in law to come pick up the two kids immediately and he drove them over to my brother in law's house. In the end, my son and I ended up not eating anything for dinner (cereal only) as honestly I was tired after cooking once and annoyed by the situation.

Well, here we are again Monday morning. And as usual, the sub is littered with ‚ÄúI failed‚Äù and ‚ÄúI relapsed‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm such a loser‚Äù posts. 

Once more ‚Äî doing the same thing over and over expecting different results is a good working definition of insanity. 

Have you eliminated easy access to porn? Know why I‚Äôm not looking at porn right now? Because I can‚Äôt get at it. I probably could if I really worked at it ‚Äî reset my phone or something drastic. But that‚Äôs a pretty big ask for me. Get rid of apps that you use to access porn. Get rid of browsers if you need to as well. Have someone password protect your AppStore so you don‚Äôt redownload and porn out. What‚Äôs the key here? DO what you need to do. Is it a pain? Yes. But guess what? It works. 

Get accountability in your life. Addiction thrives in isolation. It dies in community. Get another dude in your life ‚Äî real life ‚Äî and get accountable. What does that look like? It‚Äôs a phone call every day for the next 90 days or so. It‚Äôs 2-6 texts a day for the next 90 days or so. It‚Äôs coffee once a week together. It‚Äôs confession time. All your deepest darkest crap. Get it out there. It‚Äôs painful. It‚Äôs embarrassing. It‚Äôs cleansing. It‚Äôs freedom finally. 

Get fellowship in your life. Men‚Äôs group, youth group, college group, small group‚Äî a group of fellow believers ostensibly for a Bible study or going through a study book of some sort, but fellowship breaks out. You learn about them, they learn about you. You find out Mr Perfect over there ain‚Äôt so perfect and you let your guard down a bit as well. This is doing life together. It‚Äôs vital as Christians to have this going on. You‚Äôre going to need help with life ‚Äî it‚Äôs just the way life is and fellowship is how it‚Äôs done. 

As this is going on, as you get some semblance of sobriety in your life you‚Äôll notice a funny thing happening inside of you. Your heart will begin to change. It won‚Äôt seem like much at first. And you‚Äôll probably have periods of doubt that anything is happening at all. But as the days of porning out recede a bit, as you stop fueling the monster of lust you‚Äôve created, things will start to change on the inside. 

This really isn‚Äôt a porn problem or a masturbation problem. It really is a heart problem. Some fortunate few get emergency surgery and are released the next day. For most of us here, it‚Äôs not the way God works. God gives me just a little healing each day. And I‚Äôve gotta go back every day for more. Sometimes three and four times a day. God knows if He gave it to me all at once I‚Äôd just take off running and live my life. Doling out His healing a bit at a time keeps me close to Him, dependent on Him. I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs how He works on you too.

Just looking for some pointers.

We go through alot of coffee in my house and I'm a big espresso drinker - I'm just getting into the rabbit hole of home roasting. Unfortunately with the cost of living at the moment buying $50/$60 kg bags of coffee is a luxury we can't afford.

Aldi beans have been doing the job (surprisingly decent for a classic Italian style espresso) but after doing a heatgun roast with some beans I was given I realised that I could do a pretty good job & I want a lighter roast and more bean character in my cup.

So Ive been getting some more variety's of  green beans and roasting myself with moderate success. they taste good in espresso but a can't get a filter cup I'm hugely happy with and my beans don't smell nearly as fragrant as coffee shop roasts (esp the proud Marys I just treated myself to). Is this simply underdeveloping the roast ?

I generally try to get it yellow quickly then back off for first crack, another 30s-1min after first crack I will dump it out and cool it off as quickly as possible, then store  in airtight vaccum canisters for hopefully a week before curiosity gets the better of me.

I have been just holding the gun and whisking beans in a colinder (which is great but it stops me writing down times and taking temps). Generally try to get beans yellow quickly then back off for first crack, another 30s-1min after first crack I will dump it out and cool it off as quickly as possible, Getting around 13% / 15% moisture loss.

So what's my best path for progress?
Do I NEED to monitor all my temps and write them down? And if so do I try to find a clamp or something to hd my heat gun? Or will I just outgrow this and need to get a gene cafe or similar? If not would a solid bowl be better than a collider?
Should I start cupping batches against each other?

I love how free and easy it is at the moment and I don't want to make it a drag with lots of not fun things like writing down temps or setting up a big rig to get a batch done but I feel like that may also hold me back from getting better.

Beanswise I have a Brazilian pulped natural 
And I'm picking up 5kg of a Columbianand Ethiopian tomorrow for cheeaaap. Dunno if they will be good but at $5kg I thought they would make good practice fodder

What was the post op period like for anyone that has had this?

I‚Äôm week 3 of 6, non-weight bearing using crutches. 

I‚Äôve had excruciating nerve pain down the inside of my leg below the knee. I also have altered sensations that make my leg feel like it‚Äôs asleep when I touch it. It is also hypersensitive to anything - a sheet brushing over it at night hurts and feels like it‚Äôs extremely sunburnt and excruciating. 

I‚Äôve had to return to hospital and my GP to get much stronger pain killers that are targeted to nerve pain.  This has dulled the intensity and frequency of the nerve pain but not helped the altered sensations. 

My knee is marginally swollen, but good range of motion and was never overly swollen. 

When elevated, my leg appears normal apart from the nerve pain and altered sensations. As soon as I stand up - to make a coffee or brush my teeth the leg becomes red/purple and mottled. 

The skin on my surgery leg is also starting to peel.

I‚Äôve put these changes down to not using the leg like my other one, and am hopeful these changes will subside once weight bearing again, but should I be worried?

I don‚Äôt have any signs of DVT and did a 10 day course of prophylactic to prevent this.

1iwzkvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1iwzkvg/could_not_following_medical_orders_be_considered/,Could not following medical orders be considered self harm?,"First time posting. I have (had really I guess) a friend for over ten years.  The very first meeting we had they basically became my bff and we were very close, like doing stuff most weekends, until they moved home about a year before Covid. Then they moved back and Covid hit.   
  
Then the really irrational behavior started. Like, saying their roommate was spying on them and how her cousin would probably kill her aunt and/or burn the house down to get insurance money because my friend was no longer helping out. Or how they went at Christmas to NYC, but the reason they got Covid was that the cousin brought it home from their job because the friend wore a mask in NYC. They cut out so many people who helped them because the person said the wrong thing, or didn't respond the way they wanted.    
  
Their aunt did die, but I missed the messages as I was on vacation in the mountains and had no signal.  It turned into a thing where they felt unsupported and they definitely started to pull away. I look back and I think for about eight months we only did anything when I reached out, unless they needed something.  
About a year ago they sent around 150 messages one night about their health situation. I responded to some and and then stopped because I was busy helping my family and they never messaged me again and I also never messaged them back. I guess I was just so overwhelmed that I didn't know what to do.  So, sort of a mutual ghosting?   
  
They had numerous medical issues, some real, some probably not, but they always seemed to be lying to the doctor about symptoms and test results and/or not taking meds properly, refusing to believe results.   
Could this be considered self-harm? I don't think they ever tried to hurt themselves in an attempt sort of way, but this troubled me. 

I still miss them as a friend and I wish we could get together like for a coffee every once in a while, but I know this isn't really possible. ",2,1740395207.0,BPDlovedones,5,0.75,False

What was the post op period like for anyone that has had this?

I‚Äôm week 3 of 6, non-weight bearing using crutches. 

I‚Äôve had excruciating nerve pain down the inside of my leg below the knee. I also have altered sensations that make my leg feel like it‚Äôs asleep when I touch it. It is also hypersensitive to anything - a sheet brushing over it at night hurts and feels like it‚Äôs extremely sunburnt and excruciating. 

I‚Äôve had to return to hospital and my GP to get much stronger pain killers that are targeted to nerve pain.  This has dulled the intensity and frequency of the nerve pain but not helped the altered sensations. 

My knee is marginally swollen, but good range of motion and was never overly swollen. 

When elevated, my leg appears normal apart from the nerve pain and altered sensations. As soon as I stand up - to make a coffee or brush my teeth the leg becomes red/purple and mottled. 

The skin on my surgery leg is also starting to peel.

I‚Äôve put these changes down to not using the leg like my other one, and am hopeful these changes will subside once weight bearing again, but should I be worried?

I don‚Äôt have any signs of DVT and did a 10 day course of prophylactic to prevent this.

The second time was when I had pink eye, and now I seem to have some virus with a fever, and my throat feels miserable.

I‚Äôm canceling my endoscopy and colonoscopy for the second time because I‚Äôm feeling unwell. The first time, I was prescribed omeprazole, which caused constant heartburn for a couple of weeks. Now, I‚Äôm taking famotidine, but it‚Äôs also not helping. My anxiety is high as I‚Äôm wondering if it could be something else.

I‚Äôve been on a low-acid diet for a week but haven‚Äôt noticed any difference. Another strange symptom is that when I blow my nose, I have bloody mucus, which started when my first symptoms began.

1iwzhxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1iwzhxq/ok_im_officially_stumped/,OK I'm officially stumped,"35 years in IT, sysadminning Windows servers since NT3.51, and i've got my first weird one.  I'd appreciate any suggestions of where to try next:

We have a customer with a remote desktop server and a file server, and they have roaming profiles set up so that the user's desktop is saved to the fileserver.  Been that way (over many iterations of servers) since Windows Server 2000.  They're now on Windows Server 2022.

One user complains that on her desktop she can access/delete/manipulate all files \*except\* PDFs (we'll gloss over the stupidity of saving files on her desktop because at least that's on a server that's backed up).  She wants them deleted (there are 8 of them).  No problem I say.

I log into the fileserver as domain administrator, click the files and click delete - access denied.  OK, right-click to view the permissions, and it won't tell me the file owner.  It also won't let me take ownership - access denied, so i'm unable to do anything about the rest of the permissions.

Takeown.exe - access denied

cacls.exe - access denied

There's also no open files related to these, so no file locks or anything like that.  Attrib only gives that the files have the archive bit set.

The desktop folder has full control permissions for the user and for domain admins and also creator owner & system, so essentially nothing that should stop the inheriting of permissions or the taking of ownership.

Is there a ""for christ's sakes just do it"" widget i'm missing?

EDIT - thank you ever so much to those who responded.  Some amazing suggestions to help.  I did mention I checked for open files and the server didn't show me them...I checked a second time and THERE THEY WERE!  Deleted the file handle locks and BOOM the files just disappeared from the filesystem.  Thanks especially to u/lostineurope01 for the prompt to check again.

My best friend from middle school is a man child. I (29F) have a gay male best friend from middle school (29M). We have a long distance best friendship and always have, since I have lived in several different places after high school. He is sensitive, kind and silly. But he‚Äôs really disappointed me in recent years- he battles with alcoholism, his mom and brother pay his rent to live in LA (where he lives), he doesn‚Äôt have a job and hardly applies but blames his unemployment on the market. He visited me and he has no house manners- spills food we make like a baby in a high chair, put his dirty socks and undies on my bed while he showered, doesn‚Äôt offer to help clean or do his own dishes, and he generously paid for my coffee and meal out to thank me for hosting‚Ä¶ but then he pouted when I wouldn‚Äôt pay for his brunch. Like?? You‚Äôve been eating my food, staying at my house and drinking my coffee. I‚Äôm not going to pay for you to eat out. He is late to everything (was 2 hours late coming in to meet me, 1 hour late to pick me up from work like he said he would). He won‚Äôt eat any vegetable. I love him dearly, but he is so self-centered and not self aware. I already drew a boundary with him about his drinking (him getting blackout when no one else does makes me uncomfortable and from now on I only want to do sober hang outs) and I think that really hurt him, knowing his drinking problem made me uncomfortable. So, further hard talks are out of the question for the next few months or even‚Ä¶ year. He is a sensitive, caring soul. His behaviors are just disappointing, he‚Äôs insecure enough. Any more criticism would be hard for him. What do I do? I feel like I should just ignore his man childishness, let him figure it out and just love him from afar (not invite him for weekend stays anymore).

My actual medication/supplements consist in:  Omega 3, Magnesium citrate, Zinc 25mg, Finasteride & Minoxidil (saved my mental heatlh).

My diet its quite simple: Rice cake brown rice, coffee, chicken breast, white rice, quinoa with water, pork mince, potatoes, zucchini, carrots, espinach (boiled all) and sometimes red meat or similar. I know its not a great diet but still.  I was trying to drink kefir... but just for two days.

Feel a bit lost about what to do.. I don't really suffer from any serious pain, I am usually quite bloated and with tummy rumbling almost without consuming anything. Maybe a feeling of inflammation in the small bowel. I don't think I have reflux or it is unusual. The only GP who offered me a treatment was to check my stool and nothing came up.

1iwz1o9,https://www.reddit.com/r/YourGhostStories/comments/1iwz1o9/theres_something_wrong_with_the_soft_play_centre/,There‚Äôs something wrong with the soft play centre.,"When my Manager offered me extra shifts last week, I said yes without hesitation. I don‚Äôt do much in the evenings, and I could use the extra cash. 

‚ÄúGet Nadia to show you round the play centre before you leave today,‚Äù said Craig.

Nadia‚Äôs my coworker. The soft play centre is her patch. Most jobs at the Leisure centre take two, maybe three hours at most, but Nadia rarely got away before ten each night. 

My tongue was already in knots. ‚ÄúSorry‚Äìwould it be ok if I got here for, like, 5pm?‚Äù

He gave a smiling nod. ‚ÄúNadia doesn‚Äôt usually start the clean ‚Äòtil six.‚Äù

I thanked him again. Good manners make up for all the times I‚Äôd taken his instructions way too literally. Craig‚Äôs been much more tolerant with me than other bosses. His slow, plodding steps and thick Blackpool accent made it hard to feel afraid of him.

‚ÄúSee how you like it,‚Äù  he fell in step beside me as I continued down the corridor to find my colleague. I thought he was making a joke, and tried a laugh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm probably a bit old for soft play.‚Äù

He laughed. ‚ÄúNo, I meant the cleaning shift.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Äìof course.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very different job from cleaning the gym. But if you like it, you could maybe take these hours on for good.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs Nadia leaving?‚Äù 

Craig gave a slow shrug. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs off on holiday this week‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll see what happens after that. Thanks, sweetheart.‚Äù

 I liked Nadia. We didn‚Äôt know each other that well, but I‚Äôd only ever had kindly smiles from her and she never seemed annoyed when I asked for help. What‚Äôs more, I always thought that she kind of looked like Mary from Silent Hill (!) Eventually I found her in the cleaning cupboard, twirling her earphones round her finger. 

‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù 

At the sound of my voice, she let out a stifled gasp. 

I smiled an apology. ‚ÄúI should have knocked.‚Äù


She stared at me, wide-eyed, for a second or so, waiting for her brain to process whose face she was looking at. ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù she laid her hand on my arm. ‚ÄúSorry, honey, sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúN-no worries. Um‚ÄìCraig says you‚Äôre off, tomorrow?‚Äù

She nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm c-covering your shifts this week,‚Äù I continued, ‚Äú...just wondered if you had a second to show me how you clean the soft play sometime this morning?‚Äù

Nadia looked at me in silence for a minute. It made me feel a little awkward. Had I offended her? ‚ÄúCraig asked you to cover me?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I smiled. Her eyes grew wider. I felt myself wilt. I guessed she thought I wasn‚Äôt competent (but was too nice to admit it.)

‚ÄúUh-huh.‚Äù She shook her head, and stuck her phone back in her pocket, leaving the earphones trailing. Ushering me out, she smiled hard. ‚ÄúI start upstairs.‚Äù

The experience of that first walk-around was one of nostalgia. The faded walls, the gaudy illustrations of cartoon animals, and the playful shadows cast by snaking slides and sprawling ball pits were precisely as I remembered them. The sickly smell of birthday cake and vomit inspired in me a wave of memories. As we plodded round the parent‚Äôs cafe, I could almost see Mum sipping tea at the corner table, like some disconsolate prisoner. I felt my brother‚Äôs spirit running to the rope swing that dangled barely half a foot from the cushioned floor. Even the squeak of Nadia‚Äôs trainers against the spongy green floor was tinged with childhood. I remembered every lonely moment, playing by myself at the back while the other kids giggled behind me. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mop everyday,‚Äù Nadia‚Äôs voice brought me back from reverie. 

‚ÄúOh. That‚Äôs good.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly once or twice a week. Or when someone‚Äôs spilled juice.‚Äù

I was glad to hear it. At the back of the soft play, the dimly lit corridors wound left and right without any discernible pattern. We passed a solitary waste bin. Shaped like an anthropomorphic beetle, its sordid smile betrayed ten years‚Äô grime. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶change the bins too, right?‚Äù I asked, when the silence had lasted a little too long between us.

‚ÄúIf you want,‚Äù Nadia turned to me. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not technically meant to start clean-down until 6pm. But I try and sneak in here at 5. That way I‚Äôm not here after dark.‚Äù

‚ÄúI imagine it‚Äôs a bit spooky after dark, back here‚Äì‚Äù

I meant it as a joke, but Nadia took me seriously. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to stay the whole three hours, you know.‚Äù

Her heavy tone caught me off guard. But as I studied her face, I saw her features bore a strange, almost protective quality. ‚ÄúJust make sure you don‚Äôt hang around if you don‚Äôt need to. You‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt take a whole three hours. And if you feel weird about being here alone, just lock up and get out. Ok?‚Äù

I was touched. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

She held my gaze. It was as though she wanted me to say something more, but I couldn‚Äôt think of anything to say that wouldn‚Äôt sound contrived. ‚ÄúStill,‚Äù she added, at last. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt put yourself at risk. It‚Äôs not worth it.‚Äù

My first shift was that night. I got to the sports centre just before 5 and got a redbull from the vending machine. Before I went any further, I pulled my earphones carefully over my head. The long, strip-lit corridor has that hard, vinyl flooring that makes footsteps offensively loud. I pattered past the disused lockers and the old squash courts, until I reached the door emblazoned:

TunnelWig Play Centre

I swiped my card and opened the door. As it was nearly closing, a handful of kids were visible through the rope mesh that separated the play centre from the parents‚Äô cafe. A tired looking young woman called her child from one of the tables as the supervisor appeared behind the counter. She was tall and blonde; maybe 28, or 29 years old, and very pretty. ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she flashed me a sunny smile. 

‚ÄúHello,‚Äù I mumbled. ‚ÄúAm‚Ä¶I too early to get started?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Nadia?‚Äù 

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs on holiday.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Äìyou‚Äôre covering?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh-huh,‚Äù the sound of my voice was egregious to me. 

She nodded over to the cafe. ‚ÄúWould you mind getting started over there, please? Someone‚Äôs just wee-weed on the floor.‚Äù

My attraction to her died that instant. I filled my bucket full of lemon soap and hot water, before dragging it over to the pool of ‚Äúwee-wee‚Äù (!) I finished up the floor and got started in the cafe; sweeping crumbs off tables, wiping down chairs, before running the shitty Henry-Hoover over the sticky floor. 

It was nearly half eight when I got done, and all the play centre staff had left. I sighed. I was so tired, and the constant smell of nappies grated on my senses. Waiting for me upstairs was the wreckage of a birthday party. Garish cellophane and dishevelled party hats were strewn over the floor. I crouched down and crawled inside the jungle gym itself. Cake crumbs and sticky fingerprints were smeared across the interlocking foam flooring and walls. I cleared as much as I could, before shuffling back out of the cramped tunnel to empty the pan. 

It takes a lot to gross me out these days. What I noticed in the pan didn‚Äôt gross me out as such, but gave me pause. Amidst the party crumbs was a single strand of human hair. There‚Äôs nothing abnormal in that; kids pull each other‚Äôs hair out all the time. The weird thing is that this hair was silver. 

Wrinkling my nose, I lowered the dustpan into the cafe bin. Someone‚Äôs grandma must have followed their grandchild into the squishy tunnel and got stuck. Maybe they had smuggled in some red wine to pass the time, while their infant threw themselves at other kids and into ball pits for hours. It must have been a very small old lady who could fit in there. 

Once the crumbs were clear, I shuffled back out of the tunnel. It wasn‚Äôt easy; even at five foot five, I was too long for the environment and ended up back-crawling out of the warren like a fat badger. The soft play‚Äôs cushions were warm to the touch, but it was freezing in the cafe area. I pulled my jacket closer over my uniform. If the janitors had turned the central heating off, I was probably the only person left onsite. I never thought I cared about working late, but the idea of the empty swimming pools and miles of deserted corridors gave me a creepy feeling. I‚Äôd never been at the Leisure centre this late before. Maybe that‚Äôs why my soul left my body when I caught sight of a leering face out of the corner of my eyes. 

It was, of course, only the beetle-bin; its plastic mouth  incapable of anything more than a shit-eating grin. Laughing, I sauntered over to it and produced another cloth from my pocket. I sprayed the synthetic cheek with blue window cleaning fluid and scrubbed coffee spots off the white cast teeth. 

‚ÄúWhy would they put this in a kids‚Äô play centre?‚Äù Don‚Äôt get me wrong; the hideous, sordid creature was probably charming when it was new. In its present state, only Russ McKamey would choose it for furniture. The sleazy effect was not helped by the slogan slapped on the wall above in yellow bubble-writing: Can you find the tunnel Wig?

I fucking hope not. I finished polishing the bin, and reached to unscrew its grey head. I carefully held my breath as I ducked close to its mouth to prevent the damp, rotten smell of the rubbish from invading my senses. It did not. 

I jumped back from the beetle-bin. Its many limbs were fixed in a perpetual shrug. You get used to freaky stenches when you clean for a living, but this smell was different. Think sickly-sweet birthday cake frosting, mixed with banana peels and those button mushrooms that languish at the bottom of the vegetable draw. Think mould furring on apples, or a halloween pumpkin left out in the rain until January. 

What the hell were they putting in there? I peered at the bin with renewed caution. It probably hadn‚Äôt been changed in months. I double-gloved my hands and craned my neck back as I reached forward to carefully unscrew the beetle‚Äôs head. Had someone brought their hamster in, only for it to escape and die at the bottom of the barrel? It smelled too sweet to be a carcass, but as I inched closer and closer to the beetle-bin, I reconsidered. Sweaty hands closed round suppurating peaches. A stomach distended from a manic binge. The devil‚Äôs smoothie. It actually made my head swim as I placed my hands on the Beetle‚Äôs smiling cheeks and slowly unscrewed the top. 

The black plastic rustled, and a waft of death assaulted my senses. I turned my nose away, pressed my lips together and coiled the bin bag closed around my finger. Slowly, I lifted it, only to find that the liner was stuck to the bin‚Äôs bottom. Whatever was making the unholy smell had leaked through the plastic and solidified. 

‚ÄúOh God,‚Äù I gingerly shook the bin to loosen it, to no avail. No wonder Nadia never changes it, I thought, they should just chuck this in a skip. It was too far behind the cafe area to get proper use anyway, yet I could not (in good conscience) neglect my duties by leaving the spoiled bag in situ. Kids use this space. Whatever was in the bag, it wasn‚Äôt safe. Besides, I didn‚Äôt want Nadia to think I had half-arsed it (or Craig, for that matter.)

‚ÄúCome on, come on,‚Äù I whispered, half to the beetle and half to myself. That was when I felt it: a sharp, piercing stinging on the back of my clenched palm. It was acute, like a dog bite, but as I pulled my hand away with a cry, it oozed until my whole hand throbbed.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?!‚Äù I staggered back, pressing hard on my hand that shrieked in pain. I lifted my fingers for a second to see if my skin was broken. I turned my hand over, then back again, looking for a welt or a cut. Not only was there no blood‚Äìbut there was no mark to be seen at all. Worse still was the feeling that succeeded; a cold, prickly realisation, like sweat breaking on my brow, that I was not alone. 

My nerve broke like a twig beneath my feet. I kicked the hoover back into the cleaning cupboard. grabbed my cleaning caddy and hared out of there. I thundered down the stairs and back into the reception bay, before jamming the key code in and throwing back the door. I didn‚Äôt stop running until I got to the cloakroom. Just as I pulled my bag over my shoulder, I realised how absurd the whole thing was. I stood there, panting, and checking my hand over again. Nothing. 
I sighed, and trudged back to reception to clock out. I scribbled something down in the incident book. If there was some kind of biting-bug infestation in the beetle-bin, there was no way the play centre was fit for public use. Perhaps the closing mechanism on the lid was rusted and my hand had caught on the hinge. That explained it. The stench‚Ä¶well, that would be gone as soon as the janitor team saw my note in the maintenance book. They‚Äôd just cart the bin off and hurl it in the landfill, where it belonged. As for the creepy feeling? That was me, I thought, just being a scaredy little bitch. 

These explanations are so rational that I can almost bring myself to believe them. Thing is, I‚Äôm on the bus to work now to start the next shift. Has anyone got any idea what might be in that beetle-bin that stinks so horribly? Ideally I don‚Äôt want to hear suggestions about severed limbs or dead kids. I‚Äôd feel a lot better if I knew what to tell the janitors so they take it away asap. If anyone‚Äôs come across anything like this before, please let me know if you can. 

Thanks for reading. Once again, sorry for any typos. I‚Äôm writing this on my phone. I‚Äôll post an update tomorrow sometime if anything else weird happens.

At many stores, pallets are not allowed on the floor, so I have to load everything onto a u-boat.

What really chaps my ass is when I am waiting to turn out of an aisle, and Clueless Cathy is standing right there having a coffee clatch with Boomer Betty. They look at me, see that I'm trying to turn, and go right back to the convo.

What really *really* chaps my ass is when another customer comes along and expects *me* to move so they can get down the aisle. I've got people behind and people in front, I'm fucking locked in here. I even told one customer ""I'm sorry, I've got nowhere to move"". Not good enough. They complained to a manager who ""reminded"" me that I need to stay out of the way.

Let's apply this to the road. I'm sitting at an intersection waiting to turn left but there is opposing traffic. I liken this to having someone drive up in front of me and tell me I'm in the way and need to let them go first. If that won't fly on the road, it shouldn't fly in the grocery aisle.

I was ready to fight this old lady the other day. The path finally cleared, I was halfway out into the main aisle when ""EXCUSE ME. ITS MY TURN NOW *THANK YOU*.""

I was in the back room, commiserating with another vendor who has the exact same gripe.
