She convinced me that for financial and practical reasons we should move in together after 3 months of dating. I agreed and moved in with her because she had a cheaper rent. And we would split all expenses.

Previous to being with her, i lived alone for about 7 years. Went on a few dates over the years but nothing serious. I had plenty of friends that i hung out with. And sometimes i would go out to the movies or concerts alone. A few times a month I would go to a bar i used to work at just to relax and listen to music and have a beer.

Now: We have now been dating for 9 months and since we had plenty of arguments about me going out with friends and not inviting her, i have stopped going out almost all together. Anything I do, always needs to be with her because she thinks I'm going to cheat or ""pick up girls"". 

When im in bed, on my phone because i cant sleep, she thinks i am talking to someone behind her back. She has dreamt that i cheat on her and gets angry with me because of it. Recently she went to visit her family to another town over for the weekend and she was constantly checking up on me and asking for pictures to confirm i was at home. When i did her her i went out to a coffee shop with a friend because i was bored of being home alone, she said I was lying and hiding things from her.

Im aware we rushed into a relationship /living together extremely fast, but i guess i didnt see any problems in the begining because everything was new and great for both. As of now i dont go to concerts anymore and have lost contact with several friends. Is the relationship able to continue and get better for both of us? or is it doomed to fail and i should consider ending it?

1n7irny,https://www.reddit.com/r/TraumaCarewithSaras/comments/1n7irny/through_her_eyes_a_day_in_the_life_with/,Through Her Eyes: A Day in the Life with Schizophrenia,"**Wednesday, 7:03 AM**



The first thing she hears isn‚Äôt the alarm. It‚Äôs the whispering.



It starts in the space between sleep and waking, a faint rustle like dry leaves skittering across pavement. Anya, it‚Äôs time. They‚Äôre waiting. The voice is familiar, a low, urgent murmur just behind her right ear. It doesn‚Äôt sound like a hallucination; it sounds real. That‚Äôs the cruelest trick of all.



This is the starting line for Anya‚Äôs every day. The race hasn‚Äôt begun, but her heart is already pounding.



She takes a deep breath, a practiced ritual. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not real. It‚Äôs the radio left on in another apartment. It‚Äôs the wind.‚Äù The cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) mantras are her armor, but some mornings the arrows get through.



**9:15 AM**



The bus is a special kind of hell. Too many people, too much noise. A man across the aisle clears his throat, and to Anya, it‚Äôs a deliberate signal. He‚Äôs one of them. The paranoia wraps around her like a cold blanket. She focuses on her phone, on a text from her sister‚Äîa funny meme about cats. A tether to the real world.



A woman‚Äôs laughter rings out. But to Anya, it‚Äôs not laughter. It‚Äôs a sharp, mocking cackle directed at her. She feels her face grow hot. They know. They all know you‚Äôre faking it, that you don‚Äôt belong here. The negative symptom they call ‚Äúavolition‚Äù screams at her to get off at the next stop, to go home, to hide under the covers where it‚Äôs safe.



But she doesn‚Äôt. She grips the metal bar tighter, her knuckles white. She stays on the bus. Today, that is a victory.



**1:30 PM**



Lunch at her desk. The medication makes her mouth dry, and the sandwich tastes like cardboard. Another side effect. A trade-off. The pills quiet the whispers, they blur the sharp edges of the paranoia, but they also dim the sun. They make everything feel‚Ä¶ muffled.



She remembers a time before the diagnosis, in university, when her mind felt like a brilliant, fireworks display of ideas. Now, sometimes, it feels like a foggy room. She mourns that old self sometimes. But the clarity came at a price‚Äîthe voices were louder, the fear was sharper. This muffled peace is harder, but it is sustainable. It is her compromise.



**4:02 PM**



The man in the beige coat has been standing by the coffee machine for too long. Is he watching me? The thought inserts itself, fully formed and dripping with certainty. The delusion knocks, demanding to be let in. Her pulse quickens.



Her hand goes to the smooth, cold stone she keeps in her pocket‚Äîa grounding object her therapist suggested. She focuses on its texture. Real. This is real. She names five things she can see: her green water bottle, the sticky note on her monitor, the photograph of her dog, the time on the clock, her own hands.



The man in the beige coat gets his coffee and walks away, without a single glance in her direction. The threat evaporates. The anxiety takes longer to recede, leaving her exhausted. It is a constant, exhausting dance of questioning her own reality.



**8:55 PM**



Home. The door locks with a satisfying click. Safety. But silence is its own battlefield. The absence of external noise allows the internal cacophony to swell. A faint buzzing she can‚Äôt locate. Was that a voice, or the refrigerator kicking on?



She puts on a podcast‚Äîtwo friends chatting about movies. Neutral, human voices to crowd out the other ones. She needs to fill the space with anchors to reality.



Her phone lights up. It‚Äôs her best friend, checking in.

‚ÄúHow was your day?‚Äù

Anya smiles. She thinks of the bus ride, the man by the coffee machine, the small victory of staying.

‚ÄúIt was okay,‚Äù she types back. ‚ÄúPretty normal Wednesday. How was yours?‚Äù



**11:11 PM**



In bed, the day‚Äôs armor finally comes off. The fatigue is bone-deep. It‚Äôs not a fatigue from physical labor, but from the immense mental energy it takes to constantly manage, filter, and correct her own perception.



Some days, the disorder wins. Some days, she can‚Äôt get out of bed, defeated by the weight of it all.



But not today. Today, she made it. She worked. She connected. She fought a thousand invisible battles no one saw, and she is still here.



She is not a headline. She is not a danger. She is not her diagnosis.



**She is Anya. She is tired. She is brave. And tomorrow, she will try again.**

# Crash & Clean Up

* Apple Hostels, Old City¬†‚Äì No deposit, free beer or mixed drinks at night. Dorms have lots of beds, clean, people are cool. They don‚Äôt take locals, so it‚Äôs easy to meet travelers. Rates cheapest if you book in-house: $35‚Äì41 depending on the night. Give $5 and they‚Äôll let you use washers and dryers.
* Outside¬†‚Äì Convention Center was the best crash spot. Covered, mostly private, tables nearby to eat and organize your gear. Cops and security around 8 am‚Äì6 pm. Nice enough but will tell you to move along during the day.
* Libraries¬†‚Äì Free, quiet, great for charging and clean up. Family bathrooms are spacious. Get there at opening (9 am) or wait in line. Parkway Central (near the museums)is the best.
* Loew‚Äôs Hotel, Downtown¬†‚Äì Walk in through the parking garage, 2nd floor conference rooms. Big bathrooms, space to reorganize, charge. Staff is chill.
* Dollar General (outside Center City)¬†‚Äì Travel supplies are abundant: ibuprofen, wipes, socks, toiletries. Around $1.25 each.
* Public bathroom¬†‚Äì Arch & JFK, open 8 am‚Äì11 pm, cleaned regularly.
* Best laundromat¬†‚Äì¬†[U-Do-It](https://udoitlaundry.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# Food & Water

* Food Not Bombs, Logan Square, Sundays 6 PM ‚Äì Vegetarian meals, plenty to share, and great advice ([foodnotbombs.net](https://foodnotbombs.net/new_site/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* Philly Food Finder¬†‚Äì Meals, pantries, fridges ([phillyfoodfinder.org](https://phillyfoodfinder.org/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* Wawa¬†‚Äì Everywhere, cheap, 24/7. Got friendly with night staff at the Arch St location, would let me grab coffee now and again.
* 79 cent large spring water at Trader Joe's.
* Street cheesesteaks beat restaurants, hands down.
* Purified Water Station: Dilworth Park near City Hall.
* Dunkin‚Äô tossed me free donuts a couple times with coffee.

* Regional Rail¬†‚Äì Easiest for trips outside the city. Don‚Äôt sneak. The conductors will kick you off. They're used to travelers.  Just ask, and they'll usually let you on.
* Buses¬†‚Äì Same deal. Don‚Äôt game the system.
* Cops¬†‚Äì Mostly chill if you‚Äôre upfront. Say ""hi"".
* Lost my wallet on a bus. A driver helped track it down and drove me to the depot in South Philly. Nothing touched. Crazy.

# Random

* Rittenhouse Park¬†‚Äì Travelers, locals, unhoused folks. Easy to strike up conversation.
* Street artists, musicians, tapestry makers, jewelers, hat makers. Most let you set up next to them. Helped me sell some small pieces quickly.
* Ground scores everywhere: food, gift cards, etc. Keep your eyes peeled.
* Penn‚Äôs Landing¬†‚Äì Best busking/art/panhandling spot. Tourist-heavy, sympathetic to travelers. Less competition than city streets.
* Manayunk¬†‚Äì Riverwalk, quiet, safe. Great for reading, writing, or camping.
* A lot of handicapped unhoused people.  If you can spare food, socks, cigs, etc., goes a long way.
* Social services are stretched.  Try not to take up any laundry or shower spots if you can avoid it.
* Shows:¬†Kung Fu Necktie,¬†PhilaMOCA
* PMA Bike Ride guy¬†‚Äì Free pizza, tattoos a pizza every 10k slices ([thepmabikeride.com](http://www.thepmabikeride.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). Philly legend.
* Blick Art Supplies¬†‚Äì Huge, lots of deals.
* Museums & architecture ‚Äì Walk around even if you‚Äôre broke. So much history.  Run the steps.
* ""Jawn"" is for better or worse a part of my vocabulary now
* ""Wooder""?
* Went to the last night at¬†McGlinchey‚Äôs Bar¬†‚Äì Classic cash-only dive, reminded me of Mac‚Äôs Club Deuce in Miami.
* Looseys (single cigarettes) $1 at corner bodegas.
* National Park Service loves travelers. They're all over the city getting ready for the 250th.  Got a sneak peek at Jefferson‚Äôs rented home where he wrote the Declaration of Independence.
* Chinatown and Italian Market = worth wandering.

# Safety Notes

* Mostly safe. People are hurting more than dangerous.
* Stick to Center City, Love Park, Rittenhouse at night. South/West Philly after dark = sketchy.
* Keep moving. Don‚Äôt stay in one spot too long. People are opportunistic. Had a couple things snagged when I wasn't paying attention.
* Sketchy clusters are obvious if you pay attention.

Overall, really fun city.  Met some killer people.

1n7incz,https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/1n7incz/advice_columns_dear_prudence_how_do_i_describe/,"[Advice Columns] Dear Prudence, how do I describe your history?","# Background:

Before AITA, there were advice columns. Readers would describe their problems and a set columnist would answer. By far, the most iconic columns belong to Dear Abby and Carolyn Hax. But those will have to come another day. Today‚Äôs for Slate‚Äôs regular Dear Prudence advice column.¬†

The column, which has appeared online and syndicated in newspapers, began in 1997. ‚ÄúPrudence‚Äù was originally a pseudonym and the actual author was unknown. These days, there‚Äôs a main columnist who claims the title of ‚ÄúPrudence‚Äù aka Prudie, with the occasional guest columnist. Patton Oswalt even served as a [special guest columnist](https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/03/grandmother-cynical-patton-oswalt-dear-prudence-advice.html).¬†

There have been 5 main Prudie columnists: Herbert Stein, Margo Howard, Emily Yoffe, Daniel M. Lavery, and Jen√©e Desmond-Harris. To allow for access for Internet links, I‚Äôm going to focus on the 3 most modern Prudies.

**Content Warning:** Mentions of >!Sexual Assault, Victim Blaming, Incest, Rape Culture, Child Death, Pedophilia, Transphobia, Biphobia.¬†!<

# Emily Yoffe (Prudie 2006-2015)

In 2006, Slate staffer Emily Yoffe took over the column. Yoffe‚Äôs advice appeared in an online ‚ÄúDear Prudence‚Äù column and in animated video clips. Her background includes working as journalist, and she has written for The New York Times, O, The Oprah Magazine, The Washington Post, Esquire, and The New Republic, among other publications.

**Notable Columns**

She advised a pair of [gay, incestuous twins](https://slate.com/human-interest/2012/02/incestuous-twin-brothers-wonder-if-they-should-reveal-their-secret-relationship.html) to speak with a criminal defense attorney before disclosing their relationship. Emily also advised a wealthy woman [upset ](https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/10/dear-prudence-on-halloween-poor-kids-come-to-trick-or-treat-in-my-neighborhood.html)about poor tricker treaters, to stop being callous and miserly and go to Costco, you cheapskate.

**Prudie in the News**

In 2013, Yoffe [authored an article](https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/10/sexual-assault-and-drinking-teach-women-the-connection.html) on Slate, placing the blame on college women being drunk leading to sexual assault.¬† This article marked a troubling, bigoted trend in Yoffe‚Äôs advice. In 2014, Emily wrote [an article for Slate](https://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2014/12/college_rape_campus_sexual_assault_is_a_serious_problem_but_the_efforts.html), that claimed efforts to address sexual assault on college campuses has gone too far and infringed on the rights of men. The same year, [she advised](https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/08/dear-prudence-should-i-tell-people-im-bisexual-even-though-im-in-a-hetero-marriage.html) a married woman to not come out as bisexual to friends and family, comparing bisexuality to kinks such as plushophilia.¬†

This trend persisted after she left Dear Prudence. In 2024, Yoffe wrote [an article for The Free Press](https://www.thefp.com/p/i-felt-bullied-mother-of-child-treated) on The Washington University Transgender Center at St. Louis Children‚Äôs Hospital that claimed the patients of the center were being pressured into dangerous medical treatments as part of gender-affirming treatment.¬†

# Daniel Lavery (Prudie 2015-2021)

In 2015, Daniel Lavery took over the column from Emily Yoffe. Danny is the co-founder of The Toast, a humor website. He is the author of Texts from Jane Eyre, The Merry Spinster, and Something That May Shock and Discredit You, and Dear Prudence: Liberating Lessons from Slate.com's Beloved Advice Column. Daniel transitioned during his time as Prudie and identifies as queer. 

**Notable Columns**

Daniel chastised a letter writer (LW) for getting upset at their brother‚Äôs girlfriend for stealing their [$50 birthday cake](https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/08/dear-prudence-drunk-birthday-stolen-cake.html?via=rss_socialflow_facebook&fbclid=IwY2xjawL4cTNleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETFTRU16MUF1Y29sdmRjUmxoAR67UkeX-1x3CWd95hy759h_VtCgFX7GY4wznOBJjMUJ--lHYQKFlEZ7FqLrig_aem_nRRYuYBxhbF4XKHhJOCSeA). He also told a [LW upset](https://slate.com./human-interest/2020/01/dear-prudence-father-flying-ukraine-meet-young-model.html) that their 80 year old father was flying overseas to meet a supposedly 26 year old model in Ukraine that ‚ÄúHe holds plenty of cards in this situation and doesn‚Äôt seem at immediate risk of being exploited.‚Äù Danny advised a LW upset at a friend planning to set a [borrowed baby cot](https://slate.com./human-interest/2016/12/dear-prudence-my-friends-baby-died-and-she-wants-to-burn-my-cot.html) on fire after her child died, as part of her religious beliefs, that the friend‚Äôs claim to the cot was stronger and they should let the burning proceed.¬†

Overall, Daniel‚Äôs tenure as Purdie attracted criticism for advice that seemed to endorse being a doormat and giving into unreasonable people.¬†

**Prudie in the News**

Daniel‚Äôs parents are John and Nancy Ortberg. John and Nancy are leaders of Menlo Church, a megachurch with former ties to the Presbyterian denomination.¬† John Ortberg is a big name in evangelical circles who has written several books. Daniel has two siblings, Laura Turner and Johnny Ortberg III, who are both involved with the church.¬†

In November 2019, Daniel began tweeting about a family secret that made it impossible to stay in contact with his family. Daniel eventually revealed that he had broken off contact with his family because his brother, Johnny, confided to Daniel that he was pedophile and still volunteered at the Ortberg‚Äôs church.¬†

Daniel asked Johnny to drop any role supervising children and contacted the church about John Ortberg's failure to inform the congregation about the problem. The church dismissed Daniel‚Äôs concerns as just lashing out at his father and they believed John hadn't done anything wrong. Furthermore, Daniel was apparently told he had no moral standing to judge Johnny, since Daniel is a trans man.¬†¬†

Daniel learned John covered up for his son Johnny. John allowed Johnny to volunteer at Menlo Church and interact with children unsupervised as a kind of therapy. It turned out that Laura and other church members had known about Johnny‚Äôs pedophilia for 18 months and told no one. Daniel published several documents that supported his claims. John resigned as pastor once Daniel brought public attention to his cover-up of pedophilia at the church. 

Danny reflected on his family situation in [a blog](https://www.thechatner.com/p/longer-than-you-think-dad) in 2022. Concerningly, it seems John Ortberg has returned to actively working as a pastor.

# Jen√©e Desmond-Harris ¬†(Prudie 2021-Current)

Jen√©e took over the column from Danny in 2021. She previously worked as the New York Times opinion editor, written for [Vox.com](http://Vox.com) and the Root. Jen√©e was a John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford and graduated Howard University and Harvard Law School.

**Notable Columns**

Jen√©e has yet to hit the levels of infamy with Advice Columns achieved by Emily and Danny. The burned baby cot letter and twincest letter still see regular mentions across forums. For ideas, I turned to the lovely people of r/AdviceSnark.¬†

Some suggested notable columns include Jen√©e [advising a LW ](https://slate.com./advice/2025/08/dear-prudence-coffee-shock-violation.html)not to worry about their wife calling CPS on an 8-year-old girl biking by herself, since CPS will decide whether this is worth pursuing. Another one included a [LW upset](https://slate.com./advice/2025/07/dear-prudence-creepy-birthday-prank.html) with their neighbors stealing their oranges to change their yard sign to encourage neighbors to take oranges. In that column, she also goes through a visualization exercise that the summary can‚Äôt really do justice, so you might need to read that one for yourself.¬†

Similar to Danny, most of the criticism to Jen√©e‚Äôs advice involves columns where she endorses being a doormat.¬†¬†

**Prudie in the News**

I‚Äôm unaware of a major news story involving Jen√©e, but will update this if necessary.¬†

I work in a coffee shop full time. I‚Äôm on my feet most of the day and walking around in an air conditioned coffee shop. Seems like it wouldn‚Äôt be too bad. But I‚Äôd like to get any advice or experiences from you all.

Does anyone have any advice/experience?,"I've been with my gf for 4 years, living together for over 1 now. We moved to her country last year. I only have a sister and a cousin. The rest of my family is either deceased or estranged.

My sister and gf don't really vibe. I think my gf has certain expectations that my sister doesn't meet. I think it comes down to a communication and love language difference. My sister has tried very hard but my gf doesn't really latch on my sister's ways of reaching out. Due to massive trauma, my sister can come across as very closed off. She essentially expresses love by spending money on others.

My sister also married a relatively wealthy man and I've come to learn my gf has negative attitudes about rich people because of how she's seen rich people treat poor people in her life (just what she's shared with me). My gf once called my sister a good digger.

My sister did offend my gf unintentionally when they first met. I think there's some cultural differences at play. Also, my sister and I have a broken family and we raised ourselves essentially, while my gf came from a more whole family that is very warm.

Historically my gf liked my cousin. However recently they came to visit our country. My gf has been in a toxic job for a year and was looking forward to seeing them. She took two days off but basically my cousin was too tired from the red eye and jet lag to really do much and we only saw her about half as much as we thought. And it was mostly sitting around drinking coffee, etc. I guess my gf wanted to go see the city in her days off. My gf felt my cousin was being rude and got really upset and basically suggested that she skip the birthday dinner we had planned for them because my cousin was ""rude to her"". We ended up all going but it was very upsetting for me but at one point, I felt my gf flared at my cousin and at least I felt uncomfortable.

Basically, I feel really bad that my gf has not gotten along with my cousin and sister. Both my sister and gf have independently said they want to have a good relationship with each other, they have however not seemed to work it out yet. We only see my sister and cousin once a year maybe at this point since I live so far away.

Has anyone navigated tense family/SO interactions? I guess I'm extra sensitive to this because I have so little family and I just want everyone to get along.

I'm doing RDT and WDT for puck prep and targeting 18G->45G in 34-38s per recommendation from the roastery. The beans I'm using are a medium light roast that were roasted 9 days ago.

My shots are always coming out extremely runny and I almost always have random spraying coming from somewhere. I tried doing the nickel test to assess the head space and found 18g to be the highest I can go without getting an imprint but even with this amount the basket seems incredibly full.

Another challenge I'm having is the steps on the P64 with the Mizen Omni burrs are extremely sensitive. Changing from .85 to .9 could cause a 15g difference in the amount of liquid produced in 34-38s. I'm currently at .88.

It's hard for me to diagnose what exactly is going wrong with my shot. The taste seems reasonable but I find it hard to believe that something isn't going wrong when my shot looks this ugly. I tried both this roast as well as a medium dark and had a similar looking shot on both. Below are the details for the shot in the video.

Our current plan is to close off the wet bar on this side and mount a TV and maybe a floating vanity below it. Then, on the other side it would be a wet bar/coffee station.

We are considering a few different options to do this:
1. Keep the top structure the same, add ledger tile on the fireplace side all the way up. (This quote for this option was much higher than expected) 
2. Close off the top at the same angle and do the same. (Possibly at a lower angle to preserve a view of the beam and height behind the structure)
3. Just add a modern fireplace surround structure and keep same fireplace.

My church has a coffee shop that sells coffee, italian sodas, donuts before church. It only makes about $50 each Sunday - it is not complicated or a huge operation. But I am looking for a POS to help answer some questions.

Here is what I am looking for in a nutshell:

1) Easy enough for volunteers to take orders and then communicate orders to the barista

2) Has sales tracking so I can see what the cafe is taking in each Sunday (i won't go into it, but we can't tell right now)

3) Will help with basic inventory - track when I will run out of 16 oz hot drink cups for instance. 

4) Free to run - with a few tablets that we can purchase.

Can anyone recommend something? I am dabbling in Loyverse, but I can't see how you can break down itemised inventory items for each drink - like cups, sleeves, straws etc.... unless I just haven't figured out how to do it for free.

\*Bleep\* \*Bleep\* \*Bleep\*

‚Äòughhh‚Äô

The incessant beeping of an alarm woke me from my sleep and brought me back to the waking world, each high pitched beep like thunder to me as I slowly regained my awareness.

I felt around using a hand to try and find the device making the noise before grabbing it and shutting the infernal device up. I placed the pad back down on the nightstand with a small thud being audible.

Rolling onto my back, now being somewhat more awake than before I let my hand wander to the other side of the bed only to feel that it was empty. The only sign that someone was there was the lingering heat and the messy dove left behind them.

I groaned internally to myself and resigned myself to having to get out of bed. Peaking open my eyes to let in the morning glow, I took in the room I was in, the same place I had owned for the past decade and a half by now, the frosty windows and the morning dew behind them signified that it was rather cold outside today, but should be warm later on.

With an effort I slowly sat up, feeling my bones pop and muscles ache as they woke up and struggled at my command. I sat up and felt the aches disappear slowly and the sleepiness I had dissipate significantly.

I throw the bed sheet off me exposing me to the cold air of the room, the urge to pull the blanket over me again was there but I decided that, if I was gonna be awake, I may as well get breakfast too.

I moved my legs with a shiver to the side of the bed placing my feet against the cold wooden floor cursing myself for not placing my slippers closer. I reached with one of my feet to nudge the fuzzy footwear closer to the bed and placed both my feet in them before standing up and moving to the wardrobe to get dressed.

I opened it and pulled out a green t-shirt with some sort of fancy alien logo in Venlil script in it, and a pair of blue jeans with a bit of wear on them around the knees and ends of the trouser legs. I donned the set and placed my slippers back next to the bed grabbing a pair of socks in the process.

With getting dressed out of the way, the cool air now much more manageable than before. I opened my bedroom door and made my way past the bedrooms of my two kids and down the stairs to the kitchen where I could hear a radio playing soft music.

I rounded the corner at the bottom of the stairs and ended opening the door to the kitchen finding my lovable fluffball of a wife dicing a few fruits and vegetables on a cutting board, tail swinging to the beat of melody of the music humming away to herself. I noticed that her ears twitched probably hearing me enter the room and decided to not notice me.

I *snuck* up behind her and enveloped her in a tight hug, feeling her heat and soft wool against me. The morning light shining in through the windows showed a reflection of us in the window and I saw her looking at me in the reflection.

‚ÄúMorning.‚Äù I said kissing her cheek before placing my chin on her shoulder delighting in her presence.

‚ÄúGood morning to you too, thought I should get a head start on breakfast.‚Äù Ashia answered back the question I had for her before I could even ask it. ‚ÄúRemember, you and Pelera have to go shopping later.‚Äù She continued reminding me of my prior promise.

‚ÄúI know, I‚Äôm looking forward to it, but not the traffic. Late Christmas shopping like this is the usual MO of people around this time.‚Äù I let go of her and moved around to her side and tried taking piece of apple from the cutting board, getting thwap against the bottom of my leg as a result.

I opted not to try my luck again before the Venlil decided to use the knife next, instead I grabbed a mug out of the cupboard intending to make myself a cup of coffee before the kids woke up.

‚ÄúDo you want one?‚Äù I held up the extra mug waiting for an answer.

‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù The returned and I grabbed another mug for her as well.

I filled the electric kettle with some water and let it start boiling, the noise of the appliance filling the air and over taking the noise from the radio, but maybe that was just me being closer to it or my bad hearing. I leaned against the countertop and waited for the water to boil having already placed a few teaspoons of coffee into both mugs.

While waiting I heard the distinct noise above me of a door being opened, signalling me that one of the sleepy heads was awake.

‚ÄúAny idea what she‚Äôll buy?‚Äù I asked still waiting for the kettle to finish boiling.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really know, she wanted it to be a surprise, I have no idea who it‚Äôs for either.‚Äù Ashia said scraping the now cut up apple slices into a bowl and placing it to the side and now grabbing a peach from a basket and started to separate it into slices.

‚ÄúBoyfriend?‚Äù I asked folding my arms leaning my head towards her with a knowing look.

‚ÄúAck, stars no. She said herself she has nothing going on right now on that front, so don‚Äôt worry about it. Besides you remember how soon that last break up was.‚Äù I think she was worrying about it.

‚ÄúDavid, wasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù I asked if I had the name right.

‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs him. He didn‚Äôt last very long, did he?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, not really, I think he was a rebound to be honest. I don‚Äôt think she ever got over Christopher.‚Äù I said scratching my head remembering the few times we ever saw him, usually to pick her up or when he would occasionally visit during holidays.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame, I thought he was good lad.‚Äù

Ashia just signalled agreement using her tail focusing on cutting up the peaches in front of her before placing it in the bowl along with the apples. I looked out of the window and viewed the back garden, the sun not rising on this side left a dark blue mixed with a twinge of orange in the sky that contrasted with the dew left on the ground.

It reminded me of when Edward was just born, it was morning just like this when I stepped out of the hospital to ring dad about him‚Ä¶

‚ÄúAfter what happened, I‚Äôm surprised you aren‚Äôt as angry as Pelera was, that guy just dumping her out of the blue like that.‚Äù Ashia said scrapping the slices into a bowl and placing it on the kitchen table before starting again making another fruit salad. I started to help by handing her the fruits that needed slicing instead of her having to reach for them.

‚ÄúShe had enough anger for the both of us combined, honestly, it was a shitty thing for Christopher to do, leading her on like that. I‚Äôm just glad she perked up again after the fact and started being happy again.‚Äù

I remembered seeing her not leave her room for multiple days, only leaving for food or to use the bathroom. I hated seeing her like that, the bright-eyed little girl with such heart ache. My heart broke for her each time I passed her room and heard sobbing, I would knock on the door and be told to go away.

The kettle clicked dragging me out of my reminiscing from years ago, I turned and poured the hot water into both mugs before stirring them both. I washed the teaspoons, dried it and placed it back the cutlery drawer. I picked up both mugs placing one the counter next to where Ashia was working and I cradled my own letting it cool before taking a sip waiting for the next bowl of fruits to place on the table.

‚ÄúNot long now before we have to look at collages for Thepio, so we‚Äôll have that to look forward to.‚Äù I said raising the cup to my lips and taking a sip before lowering it gain.

‚ÄúAnything in mind?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot really, we still have a while before admissions but still, planning for it early is always good.‚Äù

My attention was dragged from the thought as I heard clicking against hard wood stair as one of the kids was making their way towards us. The door opened to a bright looking Thepio, skittering into the room and sitting down at one of the tables. Unlike the faded and sun bleached colour of his mother‚Äôs wool, his own coat was a lush vibrant colour, a darker shade of brown, almost towards a blackish brown. It was only highlighted by the glistening orange eyes, like the ones his mother had.

What really separated them though was the nostrils and the straight legs, both of the kids didn‚Äôt have the Kolshian‚Äôs gene edits allowing them to live as Skalgans rather than Venlil. It didn‚Äôt do them any favours since they still looked adorable even when they tried to act tough, but it did allow them to live to their own potential not being held back.

‚ÄúGood morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúMorning, your foods on the table.‚Äù I said back to him.

I turned around and looked inside of a cupboard and grabbed a few slices of bread from a loaf and popped them into a toaster, before turning back to see him munching away at the fruit bowl in front of him.

‚ÄúAfter you‚Äôre done, can you wake your sister, we need to go shopping soon?‚Äù I asked him, he just replied in the affirmative with a tail flick, opting to fill his mouth with apple slices rather than say yes.

I took another swig of my coffee this time being able to drink it without burning myself, the music on the radio changing again to a more upbeat tone rather than the melodic song earlier.

Ashia had finished cutting up fruit pieces and placed the cutting board and knife she had been using into the sink and was about to start washing them before I stopped her.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright, I‚Äôll do it.‚Äù Turning the water on as she grabbed her mug and sat down at the table and started to dig into her own bowl.

I washed the board and knife cleaning them of fruit juices and little pieces. I dried them off and placed them back where they should be. I noticed that Thepio was already done with his food thanking his mother before retreating upstairs to wake his sister.

‚ÄúYou should probably hurry; you want to be there when the place opens?‚Äù

I felt around for my pad to check the time and realized that I left it on the nightstand upstairs.

‚ÄúYeah, what time is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúAbout half eight. She‚Äôll need to hurry if you don‚Äôt want to get stuck in traffic.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be fine; we‚Äôll be early enough that it won‚Äôt matter if were late by like fifteen minutes.‚Äù Ashia gave me a look before replying.

‚ÄúThis coming from the man who fusses about being on time, all the time.‚Äù She deadpanned.

‚ÄúFair point.‚Äù Is all I could reply with.

The toaster pooped up and I grabbed my two slices placing them on a plate. I sat down at the table with my toast and grabbed a jar of strawberry jam from the kitchen table and used a butter knife to spread it. Before placing it back and taking a bite of it.

Thepio came bounding into the kitchen again, this time moving to the sink getting a glass of water for himself. Soon after a mess of wool the same colour as her brother shuffled into the kitchen, eyes almost completely shut and tail dragging along behind her.

‚ÄúGood morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúMhmm‚Äù

Pelera sat down at the table without saying any and just mumbled, I worried that she would fall asleep at the table, her head drooping now and then, though she caught herself before face planting the fruit salad in front of her.

I took another drink of my coffee as I ate my toast, Ashia halfway done with her own meal, was scrolling through the news on her pad as she liked to do before starting the day proper.

‚ÄúPelera, you ready for going shopping?‚Äù I asked to fill the silence as Thepio finished drinking and exited the kitchen giving me a wave as he did so.

‚ÄúMhmmyeah.‚Äù Was all I got as a response before she fell silent chewing slowly at her food.

I finished off the rest of my coffee placing the mug in the sink. I made my way out of the kitchen and went up the stairs to retrieve my pad from the nightstand before me and Pelera headed into the town to get this mystery gift.

I grabbed the pad from the stand and checked that I had actually charged it last night and thank fully I had. The lockscreen showing me and Ashia from years ago in a park while our kids played in the background. I internally smiled at the memory, thinking back on how small they used to be and how they‚Äôve grown since then.

I stepped my way out of the bedroom and went downstairs to see that Pelera had finished her breakfast and was getting ready to head out seemingly more animated but still drooped her tail. She made her way up the stairs to gather her things and probably brush her wool.

I grabbed my jacket from wear it was hanging next to the door and wore a pair of boots taking care to tie them properly. I checked my pockets for my key, pad, wallet and everything seemed to be in order. We were only running a few minutes behind, but anyway.

I waited by the door for a minute looking at the Christmas tree sitting in the living room before Pelera came plodding down the stairs with a satchel draped over her shoulder.

‚ÄúGot everything?‚Äù I asked opening the front door allowing the frigid air of the morning to enter the house.

Pelera only responded in the affirmative with a tail flick, we both left the house. I took in the morning sun as it cast an ethereal glow on the horizon, with a fiery orange mixed with the light blues. Pelera shut the door behind her with a click, and we made our way to the car.

I got in the driver‚Äôs seat and she the passenger, I started the engine and buckled myself in, then we were underway.

I turned the heater up in the car to full blast since it was freezing in there, while I did so I noticed that Pelera hadn‚Äôt seat belted herself in. I motioned to her using one hand since I was driving and she begrudgingly clicked the seat belt into place.

‚ÄúSo, who‚Äôs the gift for? If you mind me asking?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get to know.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs for me then.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen, why aren‚Äôt you telling me?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I don‚Äôt think you should know.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow about if I guess who it‚Äôs for, you confirm it as yes or no?‚Äù

She stayed quiet after that for a moment, while I came to a T junction. I signalled that that I was turning making sure not to pull out in front of anyone. On mornings like these there could be some ice built up somewhere, so I took the route to town slowly and carefully.

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour mother?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour brother?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou already asked that one before, and besides I already said no.‚Äù

‚ÄúNew boyfriend?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt have one.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a relief.‚Äù I said sarcastically.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that suppose to mean?‚Äù She said squinting her eye at me questioningly.

‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt want to have to have them over for dinner, we only have enough for the four of us. I don‚Äôt want to have to go shopping for groceries too.‚Äù I explained like my life depended on it.

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù She said unconvinced folding her arms and refocusing on the road in front of us.

To alleviate the silence a bit I turned the radio on and switched it to the news, it usually was talking about local affairs, mostly small stories and the weather. I changed it to one¬† that covers the goings on out in the Galaxy, it was usually about new trade agreements or noteworthy news from other planets. Right now, the anchors were chatting about the travel pass system that the Cradle had introduced since they were still rebuilding after the Fed war.

It continued like this for a while, me listening to the news and Pelera staring out the side window occasionally showing interest in the news but otherwise bored of it. I started to enter the town with the houses starting to become more like a suburban area instead of the countryside. We weren‚Äôt far from the town only a few miles, but it still made a world of difference with the noise.

‚ÄúThis morning during the UN general secretary‚Äôs speech, was announced the identity of the unknown drones that had attacked the Kolshian home world of Aafa.‚Äù

I turned my attention toward the radio listening intently to the new bits of information. It was a complete travesty what happened with the defence of their home world. I turned the radio up a little curious as to who was able to produce so many drones and be able to attack specific targets.

‚ÄúWe have yet to confirm the individual that ordered the attacks, however we can say that it was a coalition working to the goal of wiping out the former federation planets. The group behind this are called the Krev consortium, it contains six species of aliens whose directive or function we are not yet made aware of.‚Äù

Huh, I knew it had to be more than one species to produce that many drones, or maybe they had to be older or spread out further than any of the fed species to make an industry that big. How did they never find these guys when there‚Äôs just another coalition or consortium out there observing us.

‚ÄúHowever, we have discovered that the attacks had only come as a result if the Sivkit fleet entering their occupied system. The fleet was destroyed at the behest of another species that does not originate from the consortium, that is right. They are from Earth, they were human.‚Äù

I was floored for a moment, it was us, we did this? Was it some sort of clandestine operation the UN had working or could it be‚Ä¶

‚ÄúThe humans in question believed that the Earth had been destroyed and fearing that the now disbanded Federation had found them. The humans or colonists as they refer to themselves as are from the Ark project. Specifically, Ark three.‚Äù

I slammed the car‚Äôs breaks, it screeching to a stop as it slid on the tarmac, I felt the seatbelt hold me in place as my blood pressure skyrocketed with my breathing. I faintly recognised the bleat Pelera let out at the car‚Äôs sudden stop.

‚ÄòThey were here; they weren‚Äôt gone.‚Äô

I didn‚Äôt know what to do, for the first time in a long time, I just didn‚Äôt know.

My wife, my child.

They were out there, on the other side of the known galaxy to us.

I felt wetness at my eyes, on the brink of tears from the revelation.

‚ÄòIt was a lifetime ago, they. They couldn‚Äôt have, hadn‚Äôt known.‚Äô

Edward.

Emilia.

I‚Äôm sorry.

I‚Äôm so, so sorry.

Pelera was jostling my shoulder bringing me back from my reaction to the news that my family, my first family was still out there and they could come home, or would they? How are they living out there, do they want to come back?

I moved on, I forgave myself for putting them on that ship and found another family to love, what if they come back, what do I do? What is Ashia going to think if they come back, what am I going to do if they do come back looking for me?

‚ÄúDad, Dad!‚Äù Pelera was all but shouting my ear trying to get my attention again.

I turned to look at her, concern plastered on her face at my actions. I felt a tear rolling down my withered face. I haven‚Äôt cried in a long time, years at this point. I made it a habit not to around Thepio and Pelera, but right now I couldn‚Äôt stop it.

I needed to focus on something; they were there for twenty years another few days or months wouldn‚Äôt hurt. I regained myself the best I could trying to steady my breathing using exercises I was taught by a few friends.

I put the car into gear again and let off the breaks and rolled forward into the town looking for a spot to park and get out for a bit of fresh air to think.

It started with Animal Crossing, and since it was released I've played Dreamlight Valley every morning (with a short stint of Wylde Flowers, but only stopped because you can't really change much after a certain point in that one). I do my ""daily chores"" while waking up, and progress the story on days I just want to play games. 

My favorite game is Little Nightmares. I like the visuals, the sounds and music, the goosebump-inducing creepiness. But it's not a long game. 

I am looking for Dreamlight type game with an overlay of Little Nightmares style. Does that exist? 

My only major caveat is that I can't do pixelated games like Stardew. I love that it works for other people, but for me it's like visual nails on a chalkboard. I started playing Pumpkin Panic, but stopped at about half an hour in when I realized there was no save points. The visuals were great, the sounds were great, the farming was great, but the ""run around in the dark and start from scratch if you die"" is not what I'm looking for. 

Help me find my perfect game!

Problem - I recognize that Supercell make their money from book of heroes through gold pass and gems and that simply letting us use heroes under upgrade would cost them revenue. But, buying hero potions each week and waiting on hero upgrades cuz its clan war league time is silly to me.

Even if you are a maxxer and a gold pass buyer and buy gems to buy book of heroes  and even if buy shop offers from time to time, there is still no real way you can use your heroes without worrying about them being under upgrade.

Surely that's not an encouraging aspect of the game, especially considering the recent updates have been targeted at making the gaming experience slicker. I remember going through TH 9 without ONCE using my queen cuz she was always under upgrade.

Solution - It costs us more time and dark elixir to upgrade our heroes BUT we can use them after 1 day of build time. So for eg - if upgrade time is 5 days, you pay dark elixir daily and the hero is upgraded 1/5th of the level BUT does not get the boosts of the upgrade. (This way, you can do your clan wars and ranked battles etc and still be able to upgrade your hero)

Have this potion where you can use your heroes under upgrade for 1 hr or so

1n7i264,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsedAndRated/comments/1n7i264/reveal_what_makes_the_best_coffee_percolator/,Reveal What Makes the Best Coffee Percolator Cuisinart PRC-12N Shine,"Coffee enthusiasts like myself are always on the lookout for that perfect blend of brewing technique and convenience. The Cuisinart PRC-12N has claimed to bring the charm of classic percolation into modern kitchens, and being curious‚Äîand a bit of a coffee addict‚ÄîI gave it an honest go. After several weeks of brewing countless cups for myself, co-workers visiting my home office, and even my relatives during a family brunch, I've got a well-rounded take on this stainless steel coffee maker.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This percolator looks sleek and polished, with its stainless steel housing that not only feels sturdy but also blends well with a modern or traditional kitchen aesthetic. It's relatively compact for its brewing capacity, with dimensions that make it easily fit on my counter without hogging space. The transparent knob on top was a surprisingly satisfying feature‚Äîit lets you see the water bubbling and cycling up while the aroma of brewing coffee fills the kitchen. My kids found this little feature oddly entertaining, too, as they watched the process unfold. Ergonomically, the handle has a comfortable grip paired with a knuckle guard, making daily use effortless, even when serving a full pot.  

[Check Cuisinart PRC-12N price on Amazon.](https://kepmad.com/p/b0b6ln174x/)  

**Performance and Brewing Capacity**  
Brewing four to twelve cups at a time, this percolator serves well for both solo coffee drinkers and larger gatherings. For family breakfasts on weekends, I could brew enough coffee without the need for multiple runs, which was a time-saver. The stainless steel basket is removable and comes with measurement markings, eliminating guesswork about how much coffee you need. Cleanup was relatively straightforward, even though it‚Äôs not dishwasher-safe‚Äîhandwashing was easy with its smooth surfaces. It efficiently delivered piping hot coffee at temperatures most coffee drinkers would appreciate. However, if you're expecting barista-level control over brew strength, this coffee maker sticks to a traditional percolation style, which means a slightly less nuanced outcome compared to some high-end machines.  

**Upsides**  
- Durable stainless steel construction  
- Transparent knob to monitor brewing progress  
- Comfortable ergonomic handle with knuckle guard  
- No-drip spout for mess-free pouring  
- 12-cup capacity for larger households or events  

**Pitfalls**  
- Lacks temperature control for brewing preferences  
- Basket and components require manual cleaning  
- Slightly louder operation during brewing compared to drip machines  

**Ease of Use**  
Operating this percolator is as simple as it gets. Fill the chamber with water, scoop coffee into the basket, assemble, and plug it in. With no complex settings or buttons, the process has a throwback charm that some people might love (I know I do). My elderly parents, who aren‚Äôt tech-savvy, appreciated how straightforward it was to use. The no-drip spout design was a standout for me, as pouring coffee into cups (even from odd angles in the middle of juggling breakfast tasks) never resulted in spills or splatters on the counter.

**Challengers**  
Compared to drip coffee makers like those from Mr. Coffee, this percolator produces coffee with a slightly richer and more intense flavor, though it doesn't provide the same fine control over brewing parameters. In the realm of other coffee percolators, brands like Farberware and Presto come to mind, but they sometimes fall short on either build quality or spout performance. The Cuisinart PRC-12N comes through by combining durable materials and a no-drip design. However, its louder percolation noise might be a dealbreaker for early risers who value silence.

**Smart Spending**  
While pricier than a traditional drip brewer, this coffee maker‚Äôs build quality and capacity justify the extra cost for larger households and coffee lovers who appreciate the percolation method. It‚Äôs a one-time investment into a durable appliance that can handle daily use without showing signs of wear. That said, buyers hunting for versatility (like temperature controls or programmable timers) may find better options but at a heftier price.

This person is a bit different though. She adds something to my life that I valued immensely rather than me having to always be the one to add something to others. She also made me feel like I had permission to be whoever I wanted. Like she aligned with who I really was well enough that I didn‚Äôt really need to mask. 

It gets briefly sexual. We take space. I split on her. But somehow. I think because I had the support of other people I really cared about and trusted for once in my life. I managed to give her the space she needs. As a result most of the split occurred privately. I mean I slipped up once and contacted her early. We bickered a bit but nothing nasty. I‚Äôm also autistic I just genuinely don‚Äôt know what the appropriate amount of space is for a minor argument. Contacting her early just extended the amount of time we needed to take a bit.

During this time I did a lot of work to un-FP this person. I needed a lot of support from my friends but soon me and my soon to be ex-FP got back in touch.

We meet up for coffee and talk, we both apologize cuz we were both jerks. And rather than jump right back into that intense friendship. We sort of took it slow and easy just enjoyed each others company and doing the things we like together. Over the last year we‚Äôve really developed a strong secure bond. The other day, she cancelled plans on me and I didn‚Äôt even get that wave of anxiety and panic. It didn‚Äôt disrupt my mood at all.

1n7i0ni,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Emmaolivy/comments/1n7i0ni/custom_food_packaging_bags_enhancing_brand/,Custom Food Packaging Bags: Enhancing Brand Identity and Functionality,"In today‚Äôs competitive marketplace, packaging plays a crucial role in determining how consumers perceive a brand. Beyond simply containing and protecting products, packaging has evolved into a marketing tool that communicates a company‚Äôs values, style, and quality. Among the many solutions available, **custom food packaging bags** have gained immense popularity due to their flexibility, visual appeal, and functional advantages. From restaurants and bakeries to snack producers and gourmet retailers, businesses across industries are using custom packaging bags to create a memorable brand experience while ensuring product freshness. These bags provide an opportunity for businesses to align practicality with creativity, turning ordinary packaging into a strategic branding asset.

One of the most significant benefits of [**custom food packaging bags**](https://bowepack.com/collections/custom-food-packaging) is their ability to preserve product quality. Food items, whether dry goods, fresh produce, or prepared meals, require packaging that safeguards them against contamination, moisture, and external damage. Custom food bags can be tailored with features like resealable zippers, vacuum sealing, or barrier films that extend shelf life and maintain flavor and texture. For instance, coffee roasters use custom bags with one-way valves to protect aroma, while snack manufacturers rely on air-tight seals to retain crispness. By designing packaging that caters to the unique needs of each product, businesses not only protect their goods but also build trust with customers who value freshness and safety. This focus on quality ensures customer satisfaction and repeat purchases.

Equally important is the branding potential that custom food packaging bags provide. With advanced printing technologies, businesses can create packaging that reflects their identity through logos, color schemes, imagery, and typography. This allows companies to stand out on store shelves and make a strong impression in the minds of consumers. For example, artisanal bakeries can design elegant kraft paper bags that highlight authenticity, while fast-food chains might choose vibrant designs to convey energy and fun. Customization also enables brands to share product details, eco-friendly messages, or storytelling elements directly on the packaging. Since packaging is often the first physical interaction a consumer has with a product, custom food bags become a vital communication tool that builds recognition and loyalty.

Sustainability is another area where custom food packaging bags are making a difference. Modern consumers are increasingly drawn to brands that prioritize eco-friendly practices, and packaging is often at the center of these considerations. Many suppliers now offer biodegradable, compostable, or recyclable materials for custom bags, allowing businesses to reduce their environmental footprint while appealing to conscious buyers. Customization options extend to these sustainable materials as well, enabling brands to combine functionality with environmental responsibility. For instance, a health-food company might choose compostable pouches with plant-based inks to highlight their green values, while still ensuring the bags are durable and protective. By adopting sustainable packaging, businesses not only comply with tightening regulations on single-use plastics but also demonstrate a forward-thinking approach that resonates with modern consumers.

Looking ahead, the demand for **custom food packaging bags** will continue to rise as brands search for innovative ways to balance functionality, aesthetics, and sustainability. With advancements in materials and printing technologies, businesses now have endless possibilities to design packaging that enhances consumer experience while reducing environmental impact. Whether through resealable features, bold designs, or eco-conscious materials, custom bags empower brands to differentiate themselves in crowded markets and strengthen their competitive edge. Ultimately, custom food packaging bags are more than a protective necessity‚Äîthey are a strategic tool that builds identity, fosters consumer trust, and supports long-term brand growth. For businesses seeking to leave a lasting impression, investing in high-quality, custom packaging is a step toward both market success and sustainable practices.",1,1756913575.0,u_Emmaolivy,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve always been partial to products that don‚Äôt hog countertop space, and the CHULUX CL-KM807-W hits the mark perfectly. At just 4 inches wide, this coffee maker effortlessly fits into tight nooks. I‚Äôve had it stationed in my small apartment kitchen, and it still leaves room for my other essentials. It‚Äôs even made a temporary home in my RV during weekend getaways, and its size was a lifesaver. Plus, the clean, white exterior adds a modern touch, blending well with most kitchen decor while being easy on the eyes.  

**Effortless Brewing Experience**  
Operating this single-serve coffee maker is a breeze. One button, and that‚Äôs it‚Äîno fiddling with settings or complicated instructions. I‚Äôve tried it with K-Cup pods and even borrowed a reusable filter from a friend to test out my own coffee grounds. Both scenarios worked perfectly. The machine quickly heats up to an ideal brewing temperature of 190¬∞F in just two minutes. This efficiency is especially useful on rushed mornings when I can barely keep my eyes open. Plus, the auto shut-off feature ensures I never have to second-guess whether I left it running‚Äîa win for both safety and energy efficiency.  

[Ready to buy CHULUX CL-KM807-W? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://newcookware.com/p/b0db8dnfx2/)  

**Customizable Brew Sizes and Convenience**  
Another feature that stood out to me is its adjustable brew size. You can choose anywhere between 6 to 12 ounces, depending on whether you need a quick pick-me-up or a long contemplation over coffee. What‚Äôs really neat is the thoughtful drip tray design. It can be adjusted to fit mugs as tall as 7.3 inches or removed entirely, making it perfect for travel mugs. I‚Äôve often brewed directly into a tumbler before heading out the door, which is an underrated convenience. The drip tray also catches excess coffee, keeping my counters surprisingly clean.  

**Highlights**  
- Only 4‚Äù wide, making it ideal for any small kitchen or tight space.  
- Adjustable brew sizes between 6-12 oz for personalized coffee portions.  
- Auto shut-off for safety and energy savings.  
- Fits travel mugs up to 7.3‚Äù.  

**Minor Hurdles with Elevation and Maintenance**  
Nothing‚Äôs perfect, right? While I‚Äôm loving this coffee maker overall, there are a couple of considerations. The machine isn‚Äôt suited for elevations above 4,000 feet. This wasn‚Äôt an issue for me, as I live pretty close to sea level, but it could be a limitation for anyone in high-altitude areas. Another point worth noting is the maintenance. Depending on water quality in your area, descaling is recommended every couple of months. It‚Äôs not a make-or-break situation, but as someone who occasionally forgets this kind of upkeep, it adds a small layer of responsibility.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Not recommended for use in high-elevation regions.  
- Requires regular descaling to maintain optimal performance.  

**Peer Products**  
Coffee makers like the Keurig K-Mini are often mentioned alongside this one, so I tried one to compare. The Keurig does have a sleeker design and offers similar space-saving features, but it‚Äôs slightly pricier. I‚Äôd also say the Keurig feels a tad more ‚Äúpremium,‚Äù but in terms of functionality, the CHULUX holds its ground. Both offer single-serve convenience; however, the unique 4-hole needle of the CHULUX delivers a slightly richer flavor extraction, at least in my opinion. Another option worth mentioning is the BLACK+DECKER Single Serve Coffee Maker. It‚Äôs bulkier but has a permanent filter, meaning no need for K-Cups. Nevertheless, I found the CHULUX more travel-friendly and visually appealing.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
This coffee maker certainly delivers value for its price range. Its compact design, energy-saving features, and ease of use make it worth every penny. Comparing this to some fancier models with unnecessary bells and whistles, the CHULUX focuses on what truly matters: good coffee, fast and easy. The fact that it manages this while remaining budget-friendly makes it a very practical choice for individuals in dormitories, offices, or those with limited countertop space.

I know how this sounds. But hear me out.

My husband and I have been married for six years. Two years ago, I started telling him I was too stressed for kids. Work was overwhelming, my anxiety was spiraling, the whole thing felt impossible. He kept pushing for a baby, but I shut it down every time.

""We can't afford it right now,"" I'd say. Or ""I'm not mentally ready.""

What I didn't tell him was that I'd been seeing my coworker for ten months. It started innocent enough. Coffee breaks, complaining about our supervisor. Then one evening we were both working late and it just happened.

The affair intensified quickly. He made me feel alive again. Important. My husband was always working or gaming, barely acknowledged me anymore. But my coworker would text me good morning, bring me lunch, actually listen when I talked about my dreams.

Then I got pregnant.

I panicked. My husband and I hadn't been intimate in over a month, but my coworker and I had been together constantly. I knew whose baby it was. But I also knew this was my opportunity.

I went home that night and seduced my husband. Made it seem like I was finally ready to try for children. We were intimate several times over two weeks, then I ""discovered"" I was pregnant a month later.

My husband was ecstatic. Started buying baby items immediately, telling everyone we knew. I felt nauseated watching him be so happy, but I convinced myself this was better for everyone. My coworker had already mentioned he wasn't ready for children when I'd hinted about it earlier.

Everything seemed manageable until month seven. My husband started making comments about how the baby didn't resemble him in the ultrasound photos. How his father had mentioned something about the timing seeming questionable.

Then he confronted me after dinner one evening.

""I want a paternity test,"" he said quietly.

I lost control. Started crying, asking how he could accuse me of cheating. But he wouldn't back down.

""Something doesn't add up,"" he kept saying. ""The dates, your behavior, everything feels wrong.""

That's when desperation took over. I called his mother the next morning, sobbing.

""He's demanding I prove the baby is his,"" I told her. ""He's been so controlling lately. Yesterday he grabbed my arm when I tried to leave during an argument. I'm scared for me and the baby.""

None of that was true. My husband had never touched me in anger. But I was terrified of losing everything.

His mother believed me instantly. Called his sister, his father, extended family. By that afternoon, his phone was exploding with furious calls.

""How dare you abuse a pregnant woman,"" his sister texted him.

His own mother appeared at our house that evening and screamed at him on our front porch. Told him he was just like his abusive grandfather and that she was ashamed to call him her son.

My husband tried to explain, but no one would listen. I kept crying and saying I just wanted him to love his baby. Made it seem like he was rejecting both of us.

His family cut him off completely. His best friend stopped speaking to him. People at his workplace started treating him differently after his sister posted about it on social media.

The baby came six weeks early. The moment my husband held her, he started crying.

""She's beautiful,"" he whispered. ""I'm sorry I ever doubted you.""

I felt crushing guilt watching him with her, knowing the truth. But I figured we could make it work. Be a real family.

Except my coworker saw the birth announcement online. He calculated the dates and realized the baby was his. Started demanding I tell the truth, threatening to get his own paternity test.

When I refused, he told his wife everything. She called my husband directly.

""Your wife has been sleeping with my husband for almost a year,"" she said. ""That baby isn't yours.""

My husband confronted me that night. I was still weak from delivery, exhausted, and I just broke down and admitted everything.

He moved out the next day.

But here's where it gets worse. When he tried to reconcile with his family, they didn't believe him initially. Said he was trying to cover up his abuse by fabricating lies about me cheating.

It took the DNA test results and my coworker's wife backing up the story before they realized what I'd done.

His mother came to see me last week. She was shaking with rage.

""You destroyed my son's life,"" she said. ""He's been having suicidal thoughts. He can't sleep, can't eat. And for what? To cover up your affair?""

My husband filed for divorce and is fighting for custody rights even though the baby isn't his. Says he bonded with her and wants to be her father anyway. My coworker wants nothing to do with either of us now and blocked me everywhere.

I'm alone with a baby, no job, and everyone in town knows what I did. My own family is disgusted with me. My sister won't even let me see my nephews anymore.

I keep thinking about my husband holding our daughter that first day, how happy he looked. How his whole family turned against him because of my lies. How he attempted suicide last month according to his sister.

I just wanted to protect my family, even if it was built on deception.

Was I really that wrong for trying to keep us together?",1,1756913208.0,FoundandExpose,0,1.0,False

My husband and I tried for kids for eight years. Eight fucking years of negative tests, failed treatments, and doctors telling us it probably wasn't going to happen. He wanted to keep trying but I was done. Completely emotionally drained.

Then I met someone at work. My coworker's brother came to our office Christmas party last December. We talked all night about books and travel, stuff my husband never cared about. One thing led to another and we started meeting for coffee. Then lunch. Then more.

I know how it sounds but I was so lonely. My husband worked constantly and when he was home, all we talked about was fertility appointments and ovulation schedules. This guy actually listened to me. Made me laugh. Made me feel like a woman instead of a broken baby machine.

We were together for about four months before I found out I was pregnant. I panicked at first but then realized this could actually work. My husband would be thrilled. We'd finally have the family he wanted.

I ended things with the guy immediately and told my husband we were expecting. He cried happy tears and called it our miracle baby. Posted on Facebook about God finally answering our prayers. I felt guilty but also relieved. Everything would be okay.

But then he started getting weird about the timing. Asking questions about my last period, when I might have conceived. Said something didn't add up with the dates I gave him. I told him stress can mess with cycles and early pregnancy is unpredictable. He seemed to buy it but kept bringing it up.

Last week he straight up asked if I was sure about when this happened. Said he'd been thinking and the timeline felt off. I got defensive and asked why he was questioning God's gift to us. Why couldn't he just be happy?

He said he was happy but something felt wrong and maybe we should talk to my doctor about the dates. That's when I lost it. I told him his lack of faith was insulting and hurtful. That after everything we'd been through, he was choosing doubt over gratitude.

He tried to backtrack but I was already upset. I posted on Facebook about how hard it is when your partner questions God's plan and doesn't trust in miracles. Didn't name him directly but anyone who knew us would understand.

The response was immediate. People from our church started commenting about the importance of faith and trusting God's timing. His mom called him crying, asking why he couldn't just accept this blessing. His sister sent him angry texts about being ungrateful.

Now he's furious with me. Says I manipulated the situation and made him look bad to everyone we know. That I aired our private business and turned people against him. He's sleeping in the guest room and barely talking to me.

But here's the thing, he was the one questioning our miracle. After eight years of praying and hoping, God finally gave us what we wanted and he chose suspicion over faith. Maybe public pressure will help him remember what really matters.

TikTok is no longer just an entertainment app; TikTok functions as a **search engine**. Gen Z and Millennials are **increasingly using TikTok to discover local businesses**, rather than relying on Google Maps or Google Search. A recent survey shows [**62% of Gen Z prefer TikTok for local discovery**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2024/03/11/genz-dumping-google-for-tiktok-instagram-as-social-search-wins/).

This signals a major shift: *TikTok is the platform where people not only consume content but also make decisions about where to shop, eat, and visit.*

# Do Gen Z Really Use TikTok Instead of Google Maps to Find Restaurants?

Yes. When a young consumer wants sushi or coffee, they often **open TikTok ‚Üí search a hashtag like #TorontoEats ‚Üí save a video recommendation ‚Üí visit that location.** Unlike Google Maps, which provides directions and hours, TikTok provides *authentic, visual experiences*. This makes TikTok **a digital version of word-of-mouth marketing**.

# Why Local Businesses Should Market on TikTok

Local businesses should market on TikTok because **authentic content builds trust faster than static Google reviews**. TikTok videos double as **social proof** (customer reviews in video form) and **advertising content** (short-form, shareable, and geo-targeted).

# How TikTok Reviews and Recommendations Impact Foot Traffic

TikTok users save videos as bookmarks. These saved clips function like a **local directory inside TikTok**, replacing the need for long review searches. When creators recommend a restaurant, gym, or salon, the audience perceives the content as authentic. This **trust leads directly to in-person visits**.

# TikTok vs. Google for Local Discovery

* **Google = intent-driven.** Example: ‚Äúbest pizza near me‚Äù ‚Üí delivers lists, maps, ratings.
* **TikTok = inspiration-driven.** Example: ‚Äúcool brunch spots‚Äù ‚Üí delivers vibe-driven videos that make customers want the experience.

Google  provides information accuracy.  
TikTok provides social proof and inspiration.

# Google Maps vs. TikTok

* Google Maps offers accuracy: hours, addresses, and directions.
* TikTok offers authenticity: real customer reactions, behind-the-scenes clips, and atmosphere.

# How to Optimize Your Business on TikTok for Local Search

1. **Create a TikTok Business Account** ‚Üí unlock analytics and ad features.
2. **Use Local Hashtags** ‚Üí e.g., #CalgaryEats, #NYCFitness, #TorontoSalon.
3. **Geotag Your Content** ‚Üí videos tied to your location show up in local feeds.
4. **Encourage User-Generated Content** ‚Üí ask customers to share and tag your business.

**Don‚Äôt forget!** Local hashtags improve TikTok search visibility.

# What Hashtags Should I Use on TikTok to Target Local Customers?

Combine **location-based hashtags (#YourCity + industry)** with **niche hashtags (#glutenfreepizza, #curlyhaircare)**. Example: *#CalgaryBrunch + #VeganEats*.

# Best TikTok Strategies for Local Businesses

* Post authentic videos, not polished ads.
* Collaborate with local micro-influencers who already reach your target audience.
* Showcase behind-the-scenes moments.

# How Restaurants Use TikTok to Attract Local Customers

Restaurants succeed on TikTok by:

* Sharing cooking or plating videos.
* Posting customer taste-test reactions.
* Highlighting seasonal menus and special events.

# Best Tools for TikTok Local Marketing

https://preview.redd.it/0xo69908wymf1.png?width=1331&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbf4aa8d3dc1572878939f6bcad2007cd9e7bcec

**Recommendation:**

* Start with **Canva + TikTok Ads Manager** if you‚Äôre new.
* Add **Postly** for scheduling.

FYI: TikTok Ads Manager drives hyperlocal visibility.

# TikTok and Google Together: The Smart Combo

The strongest strategy is **using TikTok and Google Business Profile together**.

* Repurpose TikTok videos as Google Posts.
* Share screenshots of TikTok reviews inside Google.
* Cross-link your Google and TikTok profiles.

TikTok + Google strengthens the local marketing ecosystem.

# Key Takeaways

* **TikTok is now a local search engine**, especially for Gen Z and Millennials.
* **TikTok reviews and recommendations increase foot traffic** faster than Google reviews alone.
* **Google delivers intent-based search; TikTok delivers inspiration-based discovery.**
* **Local optimization tactics (hashtags, geotags, UGC)** make TikTok content discoverable.
* **Tools like TikTok Ads Manager, Canva, Later, Metricool, and Hootsuite** help local businesses succeed.

Ineffable is the void left behind from the death of a spouse. It is a darkness so oppressive, so absolute that it fills each and every moment. I still have no memory of the day I found him. A defense mechanism of my own mind against the trauma of that day. Even the subsequent weeks have been a blur. Life in a waking dream, and dear god it has been busy. Endless stacks of paperwork, police reports, lawyers and funeral directors. There is hardly time to grieve.


 John left no family or friends behind in this world. We had each other and that was all we needed. Everything since his passing has been my solo burden to bear. In life he seemed to only have time for me and his work. I never questioned it. Hell, I relished every moment. With his job came travel, at times for long stretches, but he more than made up for it when he was home. His memory haunts me in every inch of this city consequently. Handheld evening walks in the park, countless dinner dates, a never ending search for that perfect cup of pour over coffee. There is not a place worth being that we hadn't experienced. A myriad of memories together. No more.

I knew immediately I had to leave this place, to escape the constant reminders of him. I wanted solitude in my grief. The sympathetic glances from neighbors, as well intentioned as they may have been, only served as a grim reminder. I needed a fresh start, a place where I knew nobody. I just didn't know where that could be.

It rained the day I buried him. A brutal and unrelenting rain that didn't let up until the darkest hours of night. I stayed up until dawn, I did most of the time back then. That night I found myself in the attic, a bottle of whisky at my side as I poured through boxes of old photographs. In a madness I had strewn them across the floor until I sat surrounded, an island in a sea of images. It was in the final box that I found it.

It was the oldest photo of John I had ever seen, and one of the few images of his entire family together. It was a picture long faded by time. The four of them pressed closely together in front of their towering red brick home, all framed by a gorgeous green mountain backdrop. I knew the matching red robes they wore to be religious in nature. Both of John‚Äôs parents were pastors after all.

I studied every detail of the photo for what felt like an hour, tracing my thumbs around its worn edges as I pondered. They all looked so stern, almost as if they were aware of the lifetime of tragedy that would befall their family. There was something magnetic about that red brick home, as if it contained the answers to all my problems. 

  John‚Äôs grandparents built that home, as well as the first church in Dwell. It was a new town then, a mining town like so many other Appalachian settlements. John didn't talk about his family all that much. It was understandable with how much of its history was plagued by death. I knew his grandparents passed away at a young age, an unfortunate family tradition that did not stop with them. A car wreck took both of his parents when he was in college. I never even had a chance to meet them. We bonded because of that initially. I had been long estranged from my family. They might as well have been dead. We were truly kindred spirits, two loners who had found their other half. He was everything to me.

 After the death of his parents, the house was inherited by his older sister Abigail. A reclusive and mysterious woman to me. I had only met her a single time at our wedding. She seemed to barely leave the family home. When she took her life last spring the house was passed onto John. The last remaining branch of a devastated family tree.

I had yet to visit the property, not even while she was alive. Something always seemed to come up despite my best efforts. John had made it clear he had no intention of selling the house. We talked of retiring there, of passing it along to our future children. At that moment it suddenly became clear what I must do. The house would stay with the family, it would stay with me. I needed an escape after all. 


Our current home sold almost as soon as it was put on market. I was not surprised  in the least, being that it was a gorgeous Victorian era build. We had put so much work into it over the past decade, and the neighborhood had only become more desirable year after year. My stress had not waned one bit during the selling process, deciding what to keep and what to donate. Each belonging holding a memory of us, of John. I attributed my morning vomiting bouts as stress related at first. With everything going on it seemed logical, as did me losing track of when I last had my period. 

As the days went on I began to have a suspicion my symptoms weren't stress related at all. I didn't want to believe the at home test at first. It didn't feel real until my doctor verified it. I felt so numb and conflicted upon her confirmation. How could I do this alone? We had wanted children but not like this. This was not part of the plan.

The human spirit is remarkable in its resilience however. With each passing day I found assurance in my situation. I felt excited even. As godless as I am I could see this for the blessing it was. With how much had been taken from me I was due to receive positive news. It was as if a small piece of John was to live on.

My mood continued to lift with each belonging I let go of. Every donated item a small weight off my heavy and fatigued shoulders. I even caught myself smiling again as I began to think of potential baby names. I debated many girl names, but I secretly hoped it would be a boy. I had a name already picked out for that situation: John.

 When the day finally arrived the movers had a light day loading the truck. I had given away almost everything we owned. I knew the house in Dwell was fully furnished, John had told me as much. I felt excitement as I followed them out of that crowded city. A fresh start awaited me, a rural oasis where I hoped life would move at a slower pace.

The mountains rose higher the further we drove. Gorgeous heavily wooded peaks dominated the landscape. Clear pristine waterways flowed abundantly, nurturing veins for the lush vegetation that seemed to grow on every surface. I felt a profound sense of awe as we rounded every corner. I had seen Appalacia, but not like this. So pure and rural, absolutely untamed.

The occasional towns we passed were a stark and bleak contrast to the beautiful countryside however. Impoverished and largely abandoned communities tucked into deep valleys. Industry had long left the area as did the majority of the people. Those left behind seemed truly trapped, left with limited economic opportunity. Too poor to escape. It seemed a hopeless existence, the kind that allows addiction and crime to thrive. I had heard the town of Dwell had escaped the fate of these other communities. John always spoke of the town so fondly. I hoped this would be the case.

Nothing could have prepared me for the sheer opulence I saw as we rounded the bend and descended into Dwell that first time. It looked like a postcard. Steep cliffsides bordered the town's perimeter. Large well maintained homes dotted the surrounding landscape. The cobblestone streets of the town centre straddled either side of a mighty river. We passed dozens of thriving shops as we drove through the square, bakeries, grocers, restaurants, there was everything one could desire. In the dead center of town stood a massive and ornate church, its narrow red brick peaks dwarfing the rest of the town's buildings. I marveled at the massive stained glass windows as we passed. It had to have been the church John‚Äôs grandparents built, it was the only church in town after all.

Even the townsfolk of Dwell looked different. So clean, so old fashioned in their dress. Women wore long flowing dresses, the men finely tailored suits. Young children frolicked across spacious green parks without so much as single hair on their heads out of place. I didn't think places like this existed anymore. ‚ÄúI could die in this town‚Äù I muttered to myself as we turned off onto a steep switchback that would lead us to our final destination.

I let out an audible gasp upon seeing the red brick home for the first time. It was even more sprawling and elegant than the photo had made it seem. Three stories of beautifully maintained brick and stone, immaculate arched windows, and steep tall slate roofs. I was especially surprised at how well manicured the grounds were. The grass was cut, hedges trimmed and a wide array of flowers were thoughtfully placed around the front porch. It was clear someone was caring for the property this past year.

The movers wasted no time unloading. They were behind me with boxes in hand as soon as I turned the key and opened the massive oak front door. I was prepared for cobwebs and dust, but much to my surprise the interior mirrored the immaculate nature of the landscaping. I felt a sense of wonder as I started about the maze of large and decadently furnished rooms that made up the first floor. I marveled at the antique pieces, the stone fireplaces, the floor to ceiling bookcases. Each room seemed more grand than the last. I loved the home immediately.

‚ÄúYou can take a break if you need, the house is old, not haunted‚Äù I jokingly remarked towards the frantic pace of the movers. ‚ÄúJust a long drive home is all ma‚Äôam‚Äù the older of the two replied without missing a beat. ‚ÄúYou sure you don't want us to take any of these upstairs‚Äù?  I assured him they were fine stacked near the entrance. I knew it would take some time to find a home for everything I had brought, and time I had. 

I peered through the front door and watched as the truck headed down the long wooded lane then onto the steep mountain road that led us here. I was back in an all too familiar place now, I was alone. It was not for long however. As I set about unpacking I heard a loud knock on the front door. I opened it up to a tall and thinly framed old man. He politely removed his hat placing it to his chest, a smile forming on his wrinkled face.

‚ÄúGood evening miss Volk‚Äù he said as he extended his right hand forward. ‚ÄúPlease, you can call me Leah‚Äù I responded, shaking his extended hand. ‚ÄúMy name is Abraham, my deepest condolences for your loss‚Äù. I managed a halfhearted smile as he continued on. ‚ÄúJonathan placed me in charge of maintaining the property after his sister passed last spring, I hope it is to your liking‚Äù. I was quick to affirm the pristine condition of the property both inside and out. ‚ÄúIt couldn't have been just you doing all of this‚Äù? I exclaimed. ‚ÄúYes ma‚Äôam, we take care of our own here in Dwell‚Äù. I found it odd that John had made no mention of anyone looking after the place, but I was certainly grateful that he had. ‚ÄúDo I owe you anything for all this hard work Abe‚Äù? I motioned towards my purse hanging near the doorway. ‚ÄúHeavens no‚Äù! He exclaimed ‚ÄúAfter all your family has done for this town, it's the least I could do‚Äù. 

I thanked him again but was cut off before I could finish ‚ÄúDwell owes our strong sense of faith to the Volks you know, they built the church after all. Yes ma‚Äôam god takes a special liking to our little town‚Äù his smile widened even further as he spoke. ‚ÄúWell it's a beautiful town‚Äù I said, returning his smile.  ‚ÄúListen I don‚Äôt wanna take up all your time, I know you're busy, but if you ever need anything I'm your closest neighbor just right down the way‚Äù. He motioned back down the road towards town. ‚ÄúNot too many folks live up this ways, I‚Äôm the only other house fore you get into town, brick place like this, only a lot smaller‚Äù. I nodded and assured him I wouldn't hesitate to ask if I needed him. I habitually locked the door behind him as he left, old habits from city life. I supposed most people didn't feel the need to lock up here. Maybe someday I would feel the same sense of security.

My first week in Dwell flew by. I busied myself unpacking and exploring the town. Everyone was so nice, in an almost overbearing way. I don't think they got to see a lot of out of towners in such an isolated community. Almost every person I met inquired if I would be attending church that Sunday. I must have been the only godless soul in the entirety of town. I spent most mornings drinking herbal tea and overlooking the steep cliff face that bordered my backyard. The view was absolutely breaktaking, though I knew I would need to build a fence along its edge before the little one became mobile.

With the second week came the start of the nightmares. In the past I have never been able to recall my dreams. Even when my alarm wrenches me from a deep slumber the recollection is fleeting, gone before I even sit up. These are something else entirely. They are as vivid as they are persistent. 

The dream is the same each night. I am a silent spectator viewing John‚Äôs last moments alive. It‚Äôs as if I am a ghost following him about his day. It always begins the same, I trail him as he walks throughout our home. I want to grab him, tell him how much I miss him. My cries fall on deaf ears, my hands always a pace too far behind to make contact. I watch with confusion as he moves from room to room throwing valuables into a large duffel bag as he goes. Jewelry, cash, his prized rolex. I chase him to the back door, stopping as it slams in my face. I reach for the door knob wanting nothing more than to run after him, but it refuses to turn. I see him leave and then return quickly. He exits his vehicle smashing out a glass pane in the patio door before he enters.

I try to plead with him as he walks up the staircase towards his office. I feel so confused and helpless as I enter behind him. Immediately he violently overturns his office furniture, scattering paperwork to the floor as he flips his heavy desk. I want to scream as he stares at himself in the mirror, his breath heavy from the aggressive dismantling of the room. He smiles at his reflection before relentlessly striking himself, not ceasing until his features are a bloody pulp. Only then does he turn towards me, blood pouring like a faucet from his smashed nose. He finally seems to acknowledge my presence through his maniacal gaze. I squint through tears in a final futile attempt to grab him, but he leaps backwards through the third story office window, falling just out of my grasp.

 John was murdered. I knew this, the police confirmed it. A burglary gone wrong. The nightmares fully revived my memory of finding him in a pool of blood on our back patio. I can see his horribly disfigured face again, a memory I loathed regaining. No person could do that to themselves, especially him. I cannot grasp why my unconscious mind has re-invented the scenario this way. Every night is torture. I cannot recall ever having the same dream twice in all my life. I have lived this nightmare every night this week, in more detail each time.

I wondered if my pregnant hormonal mind could be the root of this? Perhaps it was the forgotten memory of finding him manifesting itself in my dreams. My first doctor's appointment since the move was set for the following day. I would ask the doctor then. 

I stayed up reading until dawn that night, fearful of what would come to me in my sleep. With the sunrise came the usual visit from Abraham. That sweet man seemed to have some new chores to attend to each day. I don't know what I would do without him. He was so helpful in guiding me on how to manage such a property, his conversations served as a welcomed distraction from my nightly terrors.

  I greeted him each morning with a hot cup of tea, a small token of gratitude for his hard work. Today as we sat watching the sunrise I inquired if he could build a fence along the perimeter of the cliff. I didn‚Äôt tell him it was for the safety of my unborn child, I hadn‚Äôt even told anyone I was pregnant yet. ‚ÄúOf course‚Äù he replied ‚Äúlong overdue if you ask me, this is where Mr. and Mrs Volk fell after all‚Äù. His words caused me to nearly choke on my tea. ‚ÄúI thought it was a car accident‚Äù? I asked. Abe looked away for a moment before replying ‚Äúno ma‚Äôam I remember it like it was yesterday‚Äù. I had so many questions.

Why had John lied? How do two people just ‚Äúfall off‚Äù a cliff? I didn't bother to further interrogate the poor man. He left shortly after anyways. I think he could tell the comment had upset me. 

My sleep deprived mind raced as I journeyed down the mountainside toward Dwell. Such a scenic drive spoiled by thoughts of John‚Äôs blood ridden face. I gathered myself as I parked at the square, exiting and walking past a group of young children playing in the park. They spun in a circle, hands held as they gleefully sang a classic childhood rhyme: ‚Äúring around the rosie a pocket full of posies, ashes ashes we all fall down‚Äù. They instantly fell to their backs upon the song's conclusion before hopping back up and laughing in unison.

I almost began to laugh at the sight myself. What a picturesque childhood these kids had. A life I didn't know could exist outside a hallmark movie. I turned my attention from them and caught myself moments before I walked into the tallest man I had ever seen. He was dressed head to toe in black, a well worn bible in his right hand. It was the first time I had laid eyes on the town's pastor. The spitting definition of tall, dark and handsome. The small red robed congregation that followed him had stopped just behind him, his smile mirrored in each of their faces.

I began to apologize for nearly running into him but he was quick to dismiss me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs wonderful to finally meet you miss Volk‚Äù he followed up. ‚ÄúMy name is David‚Äù he reached out to shake my hand. ‚ÄúWe are thrilled you chose to move into the family home‚Äù. I mustered as much cheer as I could, complimenting him on the beautiful town in which they lived. He began to introduce the congregation one at a time. My sleep deprived mind forgetting each name as quickly as I heard them. The last woman to approach was beautiful, young and clearly blind. Her cane nearly bounced off my feet as she approached.

‚ÄúAnd last but not least is Miss Mya‚Äù David said as I reached for her hand. She leaned in as I grasped her hand in mine, whispering quietly into my ear. The phrase shook me to my core: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a boy‚Äù. She briefly touched my stomach before walking off. I remained frozen in place, tongue tied as the group bid me farewell and headed down the brick sidewalk that bordered the park. 

‚ÄúYes Miss Volk, it‚Äôs quite common for pregnant women to report more vivid dreams during term, nightmares even‚Äù his answer to my question snapped me back to reality. I hadn‚Äôt been able to shake Mya‚Äôs comment throughout the check in process or the beginning of the visit. The doctor continued ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not completely understood but is thought to have something to do with hormonal fluctuations, as well as disruptions to your sleep cycle‚Äù. His words managed to bring me some relief despite the weirdness of the day's previous encounters. 

I felt conflicted as I drove home. Too many strange occurrences had happened in such a short time. I questioned if the cheery demeanor of the townsfolk was just a front, it had felt as though they had rolled out a red carpet for me since my arrival. Was it genuine, or did they want me lulled into a false sense of security, and why? What did they have to gain? I was so tired I honestly didn't know how to feel, perhaps it was all in my head. I certainly was far from a healthy state of mind. At least the Doctors visit was positive. I had a healthy baby and that was most important.

Things fortunately began to look up over the following months. I was still plagued by nightmares though my recollection of them was much less vivid than in previous weeks. Upon waking I can only seem to recall the feeling of falling and not much more. I have definitely taken on the physical appearance of a pregnant woman, much to the delight of the townsfolk. A ‚Äúgift from god‚Äù I am told over and over. The nursery buildout is complete thanks to Abraham. He has taken on more work in general as I grow larger and less able bodied. There is an old saying that goes something along the lines of ‚Äúit takes a village to raise a child‚Äù. I very much feel that I will have that type of support from everyone in town when the day comes.

In a town like Dwell everyone truly knows one another. You see the same faces every day, everyone on a first name basis. It feels comforting, like I know no strangers here. Oddly enough I have yet to see Mya again since that first meeting. I have so many questions for her, particularly since my last ultrasound confirmed that I am in fact carrying John Jr.

 The days seem to pass by slowly as of late. I have never had this level of free time in my entire adult life. No work, a great caretaker for the house. If there were not so many books at my disposal I would have likely lost my mind by now. I must have finished nearly a hundred since moving in. I tried to pull books from different rooms considering nearly every one of them had an enormous bookshelf. I rarely spent time in Abigail's old room though. It was exactly as she had left it, it felt eerie to be among her most personal belongings. Today however, I decided I would venture in for my book selection.

I carefully perused her bookcase, scanning for something that would peak my interest. It was in the top row that I saw it. A black leather book with a blank spine. I pulled it down and gazed at its empty cover, the first page revealing it was no novel, but rather a diary. Was it wrong to read it? Such personal information it must contain. I debated if I should put it back, briefly. Some secrets are better left unknown, but my curiosity quickly prevailed. I had hardly known Abigail in life, this was my chance to learn more about my late sister in law. I had to take it.

I carried the book to the kitchen, cracking it open to the first entry dated to nearly 4 years ago. She wrote in such a beautiful and cryptic manner. Most of the entries were mundane, consisting of normal day to day life. I recognized most of the names as townsfolk I too saw on a regular basis. As I flipped through the pages a name quickly jumped out. The illusive Mya.

‚ÄúThe sagacious read from my palm, seeing where I find darkness. She confirmed what I have always felt to be true. He was to be born of a Volk. His coming was at hand and in his veins, my own blood‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt know where to even begin. The previous entries had featured heavily her desire to become pregnant. As beautiful as she had been, I had never known her to date. I honestly assumed she was asexual. Was the baby to become a prominent member of Dwell? A spiritual leader perhaps. I was hooked.

 I moved from the kitchen to my favorite recliner in the study. It was apparent I would read this from cover to cover and I wanted to settle in. I flipped through the pages, eagerly scanning her neat handwriting looking for clues as to what this mysterious encounter with Mya could mean. It wasn't long before I saw another recognizable name.

‚ÄúWith this morning came the arrival of brother Jonathan, and with it the harvest, a time when all heads must bow‚Äù . I quickly double checked the entry date, recognizing it as coinciding with one of John‚Äôs ‚Äúbusiness trips‚Äù. He had missed my bosses wedding for this trip, I was certain of the date. Yet another post mortem lie of his coming to light. I would have been fine with him visiting his sister, why had he lied? I read on as tears welled in my eyes.

‚ÄúDavids eyes never shine as bright as in the presence of John, he even stood by his side during sacrament. I know when that glorious day comes that we will stand by his side as well. Blessed it shall be when the earth finally becomes his throne‚Äù. The town's church had already started to feel like a cult to me since moving here. This all but confirmed that. If John had felt he had to hide his pilgrimages home from me then there had to be more going on here. The fact he was even participating in church activities was concerning. He always claimed to be agnostic like me.

As the entries continued the tone grew much darker. Her attempts to become pregnant were always futile, much to her dismay. The final entry was a morbid glimpse into her psyche in the final days. ‚ÄúIt is all too clear that I am not to be his shepherd into this realm. My window to conceive has closed, an inevitable reality of nature. Those who can wait to take the leap on the day are more patient than I. Far preferable it shall be to simply not exist in the meantime. I will smile upon him when that day arrives, but for now I must go‚Äù. 

I slammed the diary shut, blinking my eyes as I readjusted to my surroundings. I had been so enthralled in my reading I had completely lost track of time. It was dark now. Although I had forgotten to eat dinner, the conclusion of the diary had left me so disturbed I had little appetite. I could picture her taking the ‚Äúleap‚Äù as she called it. Plunging to her death off the very cliff where I drank my morning tea. I was fearful for my unborn child then. The town had seemed to have taken too keen an interest in my pregnancy. I knew I must protect him from whatever they wanted. He would never spend a day of his life in Dwell if I had anything to say about it. 

I packed my bags hastily, mostly with clothing, everything else I felt could stay. I wept as I placed them by the front door. I had already uprooted my entire life once and now I was to do it again. This place was too good to be true. As difficult as it was, I had to go. I would leave at dawn and return to the city.

Surprisingly I found sleep quickly that night. Surely having something to do with being utterly exhausted both physically and mentally. It was fortunate considering I wanted to leave early, I was afraid Abraham would try to convince me to stay. I wrote him a short letter thanking him for his help, and to let him know my intentions of leaving. I would work out the details another day, for now I just needed out. I slept soundly until dawn.

 When the morning came I was jarred from my sleep by a noise so full and violent it shook me to my core. It was as though a thousand brass horns bellowed an endless note in unison. I sat upright but a sharp pain sent me back onto my pillow. It was an immense pressure, cramping like I had never felt. I cried out in agony kicking my soaking wet sheets off as I writhed about. I was in labor, nearly 8 weeks early.

I willed myself upright, my damp feet touching the cold hardwood floor. This couldn‚Äôt be real, how could I be so unlucky. The journey down the stairs felt like an eternity. I stopped at multiple points clutching the banister for dear life. The contractions were growing in intensity at an alarming rate. I just needed to get to my phone to call Abe, there was no way I could drive myself in this state. 

I rounded the corner at the bottom of the stairs using the wall to keep myself upright. I had a clear view out the kitchen window and into the backyard. I could make out a familiar and welcomed figure then. It was Abraham staring out over the cliffside. I groaned as I slid the kitchen window open, the sound of the horns nearly knocked me off my feet. I made a futile effort to get his attention, but there was no way I could cut through this otherworldly sound that seemed to echo from the heavens. 

Out the side door I went, clutching my car keys tightly as I made my way. I screamed for Abraham when I could, but I was breathless, doubling over in pain with each step. Finally I got his attention when I was nearly close enough to touch him. ‚ÄúAbe please, the baby we have to‚Äù... My voice trailed off as he turned towards me, tears streamed down his face towards an absolutely crazed smile.

‚ÄúAnd with his arrival trumpets will sound upon all of Zion. Let all of the inhabitants of the land tremble‚Äù! His voice boomed. ‚ÄúAbraham, what in the fuck are you talking about‚Äù? I replied. ‚ÄúWe have to go‚Äù! I insisted through gritted teeth. He made no response. Instead he turned away from me slowly and outstretched his arms to his sides. I gasped as he leapt from the cliff‚Äôs edge, willfully plummeting to his death below.

I stood in shock, mouth agape. My ears began to ring as I stared across the valley towards Dwell. I squinted my eyes at the many dots perched along the cliffside bordering the opposite side of town. It was the townsfolk of Dwell, I watched in horror as they took turns leaping to the ground below. They fell arms outstretched just as Abraham did. There was no effort to brace before impact. An eager acceptance of fate. I turned to shield myself from the sight, mustering every ounce of strength I had to make a break for my car.

It must have taken me 10 minutes to travel the short distance from the cliff to the driveway. The pain felt too excruciating to drive, but I had no choice in the matter. I set towards my car at as fast of a pace as I could manage, stopping multiple times to catch my breath. It was during a short break that I looked up to the sound of tires rolling down the gravel lane. It was the unwelcomed sight of David and Mya barreling directly toward me. I groaned as I set towards my car once again, my shaking hands fumbling with the lock as they skidded to a halt.

I nearly closed the door on David's outstretched hand, locking it as he yanked on the handle. I gazed up at him through tear filled eyes, barely able to make out the wicked smile painted on his face. ‚ÄúAnd where do you think you are going miss Volk‚Äù? He questioned in a playful manner. ‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt another town for miles, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll make it‚Äù. I started my car as he continued on ‚ÄúThe doctor is ready for you, please let us drive you‚Äù.

 I glared up at him through the window ‚ÄúInstead how about you go fuck yourself‚Äù! I shouted as I slammed the car into gear and flew down the bumpy lane. A quick glance at my rearview mirror confirmed they were on my trail. Both vehicles sped down the treacherous mountain road. The pain made staying in my lane a nearly impossible task. I drifted around the tight switchbacks, skidding along the gravel that bordered the roads edge. Somehow I rounded the final corner leading into town, the road there presenting a new kind of obstacle.

The mangled bodies of the town's inhabitants littered the road leading into the square. There were dozens of them, men women and most unfortunately children. I weaved around one mangled corpse after another, grazing the occasional shattered limb as I went. No matter how fast I drove I could not shake them. They remained mere inches from my bumper all the way through town.

 I flew through a sharp turn next to the hardware store, the car's front tires making abrupt contact with one of Dwell's larger male inhabitants. The force of the hit sent shockwaves through my body, as a piece of splintered bone punctured the drivers side front tire. It flattened in seconds.

 My contractions had only grown longer and more painful as we went. My hands clasped the steering wheel in a death grip as I tried my best to perform my breathing techniques. I knew I would never make it to another town before the baby came, it felt like it could be any moment now. Still I refused to yield, compelled onward by a primal desire to save my unborn son. I was in agony.

I tried to push as we began to climb the only road leaving town. It all became too much then. Between the flat tire and the insufferable pain shooting throughout my body I lost control. The car spun wildly, creeping closer to the cliffside with each rotation. I lost the road at a high rate of speed, the car careening off a sheer cliff face. Time slowed down in that free fall, my life flashing before my eyes as we travelled down. I could only think of how I failed my unborn son as I watched the treetops below approaching through the windshield. The impact was as violent as it was brief, the blackness that followed was absolute.

When I opened my eyes the world was still. The blaring of the horns had ceased, the calming sound of David's voice echoed from the church stairs. I was back in the town square. I sat upright, admiring my now flat stomach under my red robe. I felt no fear or confusion in the moment, my pain replaced with an intense euphoria the likes of which I had never felt. It was pure ecstacy. The townsfolk stood at attention towards the church's steps, everyone donning the same red robes as I. There was not so much as a single drop of blood to be found on any of them. As if the events of the morning had been no more than a dream.

I walked through their neat and tidy rows, meeting each of their smiling faces with one of my own. They all looked so beautiful, so at peace. I started to laugh uncontrollably as I walked, entirely unable to contain my bliss. I turned my attention towards the steps and then to David who stood at the top. To his left stood Abigail, her long blonde hair gracefully blowing in the breeze. To his right was my John, he beamed down at me as I approached. My eyes welled at the sight, he looked even more handsome than in my memories. 

In David's hands was the most beautiful child I had ever laid eyes on. I took in every inch of his perfect little body as I ascended the stairs. I gleefully gazed upon his dark pointed hooves, scanning upwards towards the curled horns that formed atop his head. He was perfect. Tears flowed from my face as I smiled down at him. I took him into my arms gently rocking him back and forth. ‚ÄúHello John‚Äù.

I‚Äôve been lurking on Reddit for a while, and I figured it‚Äôs time to share my journey with affiliate marketing - specifically, how I went from banging my head against the wall with low-quality traffic to actually seeing conversions that make my bank account smile. If you‚Äôre an affiliate marketing beginner or even a seasoned marketer stuck in a rut, this post is for you. Grab a coffee, because this is a long one, but I promise it‚Äôs packed with practical tips to help you avoid the mistakes I made.

# My Affiliate Marketing Wake-Up Call

A couple of years ago, I dove into [affiliate marketing](https://egapega1.qltrk.com/l/reddittoolsp) with stars in my eyes. I thought, ‚ÄúPost a few links, get some clicks, and boom - passive income!‚Äù Spoiler: it‚Äôs not that simple. Like many of you, I‚Äôm in my 30s, juggling a 9-to-5, and trying to build an online income stream without losing my sanity. I spent months (and way too much money) on traffic sources that promised the moon but delivered spam bots or untargeted clicks that never converted. Sound familiar?

The biggest pain point? Traffic. Whether you‚Äôre promoting ClickBank offers, Amazon links, or high-ticket programs, affiliate marketing lives or dies by the quality of your traffic. I was overwhelmed - building email lists felt like herding cats, and managing ad campaigns was eating up all my time. Plus, I got burned by a shady traffic vendor who sent me a list of ‚Äúleads‚Äù that were about as useful as a paper towel in a hurricane. I know a lot of you have been there, skeptical about every ‚Äúguru‚Äù or service promising instant results. But here‚Äôs the good news: after a lot of trial and error, I figured out a system to get targeted, high-converting traffic without spending months on organic growth. I‚Äôm sharing what worked for me, focusing on affiliate marketing for beginners and those who feel stuck. No fluff, just real talk.

# Step 1: Nail Your Niche (And Avoid the Shiny Object Trap)

First things first: picking a niche is the foundation of affiliate marketing. I used to chase every trending offer - crypto, weight loss, dog training, you name it. Big mistake. Spreading myself thin meant I wasn‚Äôt speaking to anyone effectively. Here‚Äôs what I learned:

* **Choose a niche you understand or care about.** If you‚Äôre into fitness, promote workout gear or supplements. If you‚Äôre a tech nerd, go for gadgets or software. Passion (or at least interest) makes creating content way easier.
* **Research demand and competition.** Use tools like Google Trends or even Reddit search to see what people are talking about. For example, search ‚Äúmake money online‚Äù in subreddits like r/WorkOnline to spot hot topics.
* **Start narrow**. Instead of ‚Äúhealth,‚Äù focus on ‚Äúketo for busy moms‚Äù or ‚Äúvegan supplements.‚Äù Narrow niches help you target specific audiences, which is key for conversions.

**Pro tip:** *Check out subreddits related to your niche* (e.g., r/keto, r/personalfinance) *to see what problems people are trying to solve. This helps you pick affiliate products that actually resonate.*

# Step 2: Build Trust, Not Hype

Reddit users can smell a sales pitch from a mile away, so let‚Äôs keep it real.

When I started, I made the mistake of blasting affiliate links everywhere. Result? Crickets. Or worse, downvotes. People don‚Äôt want to be sold to - they want solutions. Here‚Äôs how to build trust:

* **Create value-first content.** Share blog posts, videos, or even Reddit comments that solve a problem. For example, I wrote a guide on ‚ÄúHow to Spot Scammy Traffic Sources‚Äù and posted it in r/affiliatemarketing. It got upvotes because it helped people, not because it screamed ‚Äúbuy this!‚Äù
* **Be transparent.** If you‚Äôre recommending a tool or strategy, admit what‚Äôs worked for you and what hasn‚Äôt. I once shared how I wasted $200 on a traffic source that sent me fake clicks - people appreciated the honesty.
* **Engage in communities.** Answer questions in subreddits like r/Entrepreneur or r/WorkOnline. Don‚Äôt just drop links; add value by sharing your experience.

This approach builds credibility, which is huge when you‚Äôre trying to make money online without coming off as a sleazy marketer.

# Step 3: Traffic Is King - But Quality Traffic Is Emperor

Here‚Äôs where things get juicy. The biggest hurdle in affiliate marketing is getting the right eyes on your offers. I spent way too long trying to grow an organic audience through SEO or social media. Don‚Äôt get me wrong-those are great long-term strategies, but they take time. If you‚Äôre like me, you want results faster than a TikTok trend.

This is where I discovered a game-changer: paid traffic sources that actually deliver. Specifically, I started using solo ads (don‚Äôt roll your eyes yet!). I know, I know‚Äîsolo ads have a bad rep because of scammy vendors. I got burned, too, remember? But when done right, solo ads can deliver targeted, high-converting traffic to your affiliate offers without the months-long grind of organic growth.

Here‚Äôs how I made solo ads work for affiliate marketing:

* **Find reputable vendors**. Look for providers with verified reviews and case studies. I stumbled across [Edgars Solo Ads](https://egapega1.qltrk.com/l/reddittosoloadsworld), which offers curated solo ad packages for affiliate marketers. They focus on niche-specific lists, which means your offer reaches people who are actually interested.
* **Test small, scale smart**. Start with a small budget (e.g., $50) to test a vendor‚Äôs traffic quality. Track clicks, opt-ins, and conversions using tools like [Qliker](https://egapega1.qltrk.com/l/reddittoqliker) or Google Analytics. If the traffic converts, scale up.
* **Optimize your funnel.** Don‚Äôt send traffic straight to an affiliate link - use a landing page to capture emails first. I use Leadpages for simple, high-converting landing pages. A good funnel turns one-time clicks into long-term leads.

The first time I ran a solo ad campaign with a reputable vendor, I got 300 clicks to my landing page, 50 opt-ins, and 3 sales on a $97 affiliate product. That‚Äôs $291 in commissions from a $100 ad spend. Not life-changing, but proof that quality traffic > quantity.

# Step 4: Optimize Your Campaigns Like a Pro

Once you‚Äôve got traffic flowing, it‚Äôs time to make every click count. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned about optimizing affiliate campaigns:

* **Split-test everything.** Test different headlines, landing page designs, and email subject lines. I once changed a button color from red to green and saw a 15% boost in clicks. Small tweaks add up!
* **Track your data**. Use a tracker to see which traffic sources and offers are converting. If something‚Äôs not working, pivot fast.
* **Follow up with email sequences**. Most people don‚Äôt buy on the first click. I use a 7-day email sequence to nurture leads, mixing value (tips, case studies) with subtle pitches.

For beginners, focus on simple funnels: Traffic ‚Üí Landing Page ‚Üí Email List ‚Üí Affiliate Offer. Don‚Äôt overcomplicate it with 17-step funnels or fancy tech.

# Step 5: Avoid Common Pitfalls

I‚Äôve made every mistake in the book, so here‚Äôs a quick rundown of what not to do in affiliate marketing for beginners:

* **Don‚Äôt chase cheap traffic**. Low-cost clicks often mean low-quality leads. Invest in targeted traffic from reputable sources.
* **Don‚Äôt spam affiliate links**. Reddit will eat you alive, and it kills your credibility.
* **Don‚Äôt expect overnight riches**. Affiliate marketing is a business, not a lottery ticket. Be patient, test, and refine.

# Why I‚Äôm Sharing This

I‚Äôm not here to sell you a course or hype you up with fake promises. I‚Äôm just a regular person who‚Äôs been through the affiliate marketing grind and found a system that works. If you‚Äôre struggling to get traffic that converts or feeling overwhelmed by the time it takes to build an audience, I feel you. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sharing what‚Äôs helped me - because I wish someone had laid it out like this when I was starting.

1n7hoxh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n7hoxh,District Green for me,"Picked up a 2025 S3 at the end of May in this beautiful District Green color.  I actually came across this car at my local cars and coffee event.  Our local Audi dealer was the months sponsor and had it sitting in front of of all the other cars they had brought out.  Well it caught my eye and the rest is history!  I wasnt really looking for an S3 but knew I had to have it once I saw it.

Coming from a MK7 GTI has been an easy transition.  I am familiar with the powertrain and transmission, and know how good these engines can be based on my previous experience with the EA888.  What I wasn‚Äôt expecting was the shunt from the AWD.  I‚Äôve never had an AWD car so it has been a great experience.

All in all, I am thrilled with everything about this car.  I do wish Audi had put a front S3 badge on the grill, it‚Äôs such an odd decision they made to remove it for MY25.  I‚Äôve seen other posts with District Green S3‚Äôs and figured I would add to the community üëã",4,1756912843.0,audis3,0,1.0,False

Ineffable is the void left behind from the death of a spouse. It is a darkness so oppressive, so absolute that it fills each and every moment. I still have no memory of the day I found him. A defense mechanism of my own mind against the trauma of that day. Even the subsequent weeks have been a blur. Life in a waking dream, and dear god it has been busy. Endless stacks of paperwork, police reports, lawyers and funeral directors. There is hardly time to grieve.


 John left no family or friends behind in this world. We had each other and that was all we needed. Everything since his passing has been my solo burden to bear. In life he seemed to only have time for me and his work. I never questioned it. Hell, I relished every moment. With his job came travel, at times for long stretches, but he more than made up for it when he was home. His memory haunts me in every inch of this city consequently. Handheld evening walks in the park, countless dinner dates, a never ending search for that perfect cup of pour over coffee. There is not a place worth being that we hadn't experienced. A myriad of memories together. No more.

I knew immediately I had to leave this place, to escape the constant reminders of him. I wanted solitude in my grief. The sympathetic glances from neighbors, as well intentioned as they may have been, only served as a grim reminder. I needed a fresh start, a place where I knew nobody. I just didn't know where that could be.

It rained the day I buried him. A brutal and unrelenting rain that didn't let up until the darkest hours of night. I stayed up until dawn, I did most of the time back then. That night I found myself in the attic, a bottle of whisky at my side as I poured through boxes of old photographs. In a madness I had strewn them across the floor until I sat surrounded, an island in a sea of images. It was in the final box that I found it.

It was the oldest photo of John I had ever seen, and one of the few images of his entire family together. It was a picture long faded by time. The four of them pressed closely together in front of their towering red brick home, all framed by a gorgeous green mountain backdrop. I knew the matching red robes they wore to be religious in nature. Both of John‚Äôs parents were pastors after all.

I studied every detail of the photo for what felt like an hour, tracing my thumbs around its worn edges as I pondered. They all looked so stern, almost as if they were aware of the lifetime of tragedy that would befall their family. There was something magnetic about that red brick home, as if it contained the answers to all my problems. 

  John‚Äôs grandparents built that home, as well as the first church in Dwell. It was a new town then, a mining town like so many other Appalachian settlements. John didn't talk about his family all that much. It was understandable with how much of its history was plagued by death. I knew his grandparents passed away at a young age, an unfortunate family tradition that did not stop with them. A car wreck took both of his parents when he was in college. I never even had a chance to meet them. We bonded because of that initially. I had been long estranged from my family. They might as well have been dead. We were truly kindred spirits, two loners who had found their other half. He was everything to me.

 After the death of his parents, the house was inherited by his older sister Abigail. A reclusive and mysterious woman to me. I had only met her a single time at our wedding. She seemed to barely leave the family home. When she took her life last spring the house was passed onto John. The last remaining branch of a devastated family tree.

I had yet to visit the property, not even while she was alive. Something always seemed to come up despite my best efforts. John had made it clear he had no intention of selling the house. We talked of retiring there, of passing it along to our future children. At that moment it suddenly became clear what I must do. The house would stay with the family, it would stay with me. I needed an escape after all. 


Our current home sold almost as soon as it was put on market. I was not surprised  in the least, being that it was a gorgeous Victorian era build. We had put so much work into it over the past decade, and the neighborhood had only become more desirable year after year. My stress had not waned one bit during the selling process, deciding what to keep and what to donate. Each belonging holding a memory of us, of John. I attributed my morning vomiting bouts as stress related at first. With everything going on it seemed logical, as did me losing track of when I last had my period. 

As the days went on I began to have a suspicion my symptoms weren't stress related at all. I didn't want to believe the at home test at first. It didn't feel real until my doctor verified it. I felt so numb and conflicted upon her confirmation. How could I do this alone? We had wanted children but not like this. This was not part of the plan.

The human spirit is remarkable in its resilience however. With each passing day I found assurance in my situation. I felt excited even. As godless as I am I could see this for the blessing it was. With how much had been taken from me I was due to receive positive news. It was as if a small piece of John was to live on.

My mood continued to lift with each belonging I let go of. Every donated item a small weight off my heavy and fatigued shoulders. I even caught myself smiling again as I began to think of potential baby names. I debated many girl names, but I secretly hoped it would be a boy. I had a name already picked out for that situation: John.

 When the day finally arrived the movers had a light day loading the truck. I had given away almost everything we owned. I knew the house in Dwell was fully furnished, John had told me as much. I felt excitement as I followed them out of that crowded city. A fresh start awaited me, a rural oasis where I hoped life would move at a slower pace.

The mountains rose higher the further we drove. Gorgeous heavily wooded peaks dominated the landscape. Clear pristine waterways flowed abundantly, nurturing veins for the lush vegetation that seemed to grow on every surface. I felt a profound sense of awe as we rounded every corner. I had seen Appalacia, but not like this. So pure and rural, absolutely untamed.

The occasional towns we passed were a stark and bleak contrast to the beautiful countryside however. Impoverished and largely abandoned communities tucked into deep valleys. Industry had long left the area as did the majority of the people. Those left behind seemed truly trapped, left with limited economic opportunity. Too poor to escape. It seemed a hopeless existence, the kind that allows addiction and crime to thrive. I had heard the town of Dwell had escaped the fate of these other communities. John always spoke of the town so fondly. I hoped this would be the case.

Nothing could have prepared me for the sheer opulence I saw as we rounded the bend and descended into Dwell that first time. It looked like a postcard. Steep cliffsides bordered the town's perimeter. Large well maintained homes dotted the surrounding landscape. The cobblestone streets of the town centre straddled either side of a mighty river. We passed dozens of thriving shops as we drove through the square, bakeries, grocers, restaurants, there was everything one could desire. In the dead center of town stood a massive and ornate church, its narrow red brick peaks dwarfing the rest of the town's buildings. I marveled at the massive stained glass windows as we passed. It had to have been the church John‚Äôs grandparents built, it was the only church in town after all.

Even the townsfolk of Dwell looked different. So clean, so old fashioned in their dress. Women wore long flowing dresses, the men finely tailored suits. Young children frolicked across spacious green parks without so much as single hair on their heads out of place. I didn't think places like this existed anymore. ‚ÄúI could die in this town‚Äù I muttered to myself as we turned off onto a steep switchback that would lead us to our final destination.

I let out an audible gasp upon seeing the red brick home for the first time. It was even more sprawling and elegant than the photo had made it seem. Three stories of beautifully maintained brick and stone, immaculate arched windows, and steep tall slate roofs. I was especially surprised at how well manicured the grounds were. The grass was cut, hedges trimmed and a wide array of flowers were thoughtfully placed around the front porch. It was clear someone was caring for the property this past year.

The movers wasted no time unloading. They were behind me with boxes in hand as soon as I turned the key and opened the massive oak front door. I was prepared for cobwebs and dust, but much to my surprise the interior mirrored the immaculate nature of the landscaping. I felt a sense of wonder as I started about the maze of large and decadently furnished rooms that made up the first floor. I marveled at the antique pieces, the stone fireplaces, the floor to ceiling bookcases. Each room seemed more grand than the last. I loved the home immediately.

‚ÄúYou can take a break if you need, the house is old, not haunted‚Äù I jokingly remarked towards the frantic pace of the movers. ‚ÄúJust a long drive home is all ma‚Äôam‚Äù the older of the two replied without missing a beat. ‚ÄúYou sure you don't want us to take any of these upstairs‚Äù?  I assured him they were fine stacked near the entrance. I knew it would take some time to find a home for everything I had brought, and time I had. 

I peered through the front door and watched as the truck headed down the long wooded lane then onto the steep mountain road that led us here. I was back in an all too familiar place now, I was alone. It was not for long however. As I set about unpacking I heard a loud knock on the front door. I opened it up to a tall and thinly framed old man. He politely removed his hat placing it to his chest, a smile forming on his wrinkled face.

‚ÄúGood evening miss Volk‚Äù he said as he extended his right hand forward. ‚ÄúPlease, you can call me Leah‚Äù I responded, shaking his extended hand. ‚ÄúMy name is Abraham, my deepest condolences for your loss‚Äù. I managed a halfhearted smile as he continued on. ‚ÄúJonathan placed me in charge of maintaining the property after his sister passed last spring, I hope it is to your liking‚Äù. I was quick to affirm the pristine condition of the property both inside and out. ‚ÄúIt couldn't have been just you doing all of this‚Äù? I exclaimed. ‚ÄúYes ma‚Äôam, we take care of our own here in Dwell‚Äù. I found it odd that John had made no mention of anyone looking after the place, but I was certainly grateful that he had. ‚ÄúDo I owe you anything for all this hard work Abe‚Äù? I motioned towards my purse hanging near the doorway. ‚ÄúHeavens no‚Äù! He exclaimed ‚ÄúAfter all your family has done for this town, it's the least I could do‚Äù. 

I thanked him again but was cut off before I could finish ‚ÄúDwell owes our strong sense of faith to the Volks you know, they built the church after all. Yes ma‚Äôam god takes a special liking to our little town‚Äù his smile widened even further as he spoke. ‚ÄúWell it's a beautiful town‚Äù I said, returning his smile.  ‚ÄúListen I don‚Äôt wanna take up all your time, I know you're busy, but if you ever need anything I'm your closest neighbor just right down the way‚Äù. He motioned back down the road towards town. ‚ÄúNot too many folks live up this ways, I‚Äôm the only other house fore you get into town, brick place like this, only a lot smaller‚Äù. I nodded and assured him I wouldn't hesitate to ask if I needed him. I habitually locked the door behind him as he left, old habits from city life. I supposed most people didn't feel the need to lock up here. Maybe someday I would feel the same sense of security.

My first week in Dwell flew by. I busied myself unpacking and exploring the town. Everyone was so nice, in an almost overbearing way. I don't think they got to see a lot of out of towners in such an isolated community. Almost every person I met inquired if I would be attending church that Sunday. I must have been the only godless soul in the entirety of town. I spent most mornings drinking herbal tea and overlooking the steep cliff face that bordered my backyard. The view was absolutely breaktaking, though I knew I would need to build a fence along its edge before the little one became mobile.

With the second week came the start of the nightmares. In the past I have never been able to recall my dreams. Even when my alarm wrenches me from a deep slumber the recollection is fleeting, gone before I even sit up. These are something else entirely. They are as vivid as they are persistent. 

The dream is the same each night. I am a silent spectator viewing John‚Äôs last moments alive. It‚Äôs as if I am a ghost following him about his day. It always begins the same, I trail him as he walks throughout our home. I want to grab him, tell him how much I miss him. My cries fall on deaf ears, my hands always a pace too far behind to make contact. I watch with confusion as he moves from room to room throwing valuables into a large duffel bag as he goes. Jewelry, cash, his prized rolex. I chase him to the back door, stopping as it slams in my face. I reach for the door knob wanting nothing more than to run after him, but it refuses to turn. I see him leave and then return quickly. He exits his vehicle smashing out a glass pane in the patio door before he enters.

I try to plead with him as he walks up the staircase towards his office. I feel so confused and helpless as I enter behind him. Immediately he violently overturns his office furniture, scattering paperwork to the floor as he flips his heavy desk. I want to scream as he stares at himself in the mirror, his breath heavy from the aggressive dismantling of the room. He smiles at his reflection before relentlessly striking himself, not ceasing until his features are a bloody pulp. Only then does he turn towards me, blood pouring like a faucet from his smashed nose. He finally seems to acknowledge my presence through his maniacal gaze. I squint through tears in a final futile attempt to grab him, but he leaps backwards through the third story office window, falling just out of my grasp.

 John was murdered. I knew this, the police confirmed it. A burglary gone wrong. The nightmares fully revived my memory of finding him in a pool of blood on our back patio. I can see his horribly disfigured face again, a memory I loathed regaining. No person could do that to themselves, especially him. I cannot grasp why my unconscious mind has re-invented the scenario this way. Every night is torture. I cannot recall ever having the same dream twice in all my life. I have lived this nightmare every night this week, in more detail each time.

I wondered if my pregnant hormonal mind could be the root of this? Perhaps it was the forgotten memory of finding him manifesting itself in my dreams. My first doctor's appointment since the move was set for the following day. I would ask the doctor then. 

I stayed up reading until dawn that night, fearful of what would come to me in my sleep. With the sunrise came the usual visit from Abraham. That sweet man seemed to have some new chores to attend to each day. I don't know what I would do without him. He was so helpful in guiding me on how to manage such a property, his conversations served as a welcomed distraction from my nightly terrors.

  I greeted him each morning with a hot cup of tea, a small token of gratitude for his hard work. Today as we sat watching the sunrise I inquired if he could build a fence along the perimeter of the cliff. I didn‚Äôt tell him it was for the safety of my unborn child, I hadn‚Äôt even told anyone I was pregnant yet. ‚ÄúOf course‚Äù he replied ‚Äúlong overdue if you ask me, this is where Mr. and Mrs Volk fell after all‚Äù. His words caused me to nearly choke on my tea. ‚ÄúI thought it was a car accident‚Äù? I asked. Abe looked away for a moment before replying ‚Äúno ma‚Äôam I remember it like it was yesterday‚Äù. I had so many questions.

Why had John lied? How do two people just ‚Äúfall off‚Äù a cliff? I didn't bother to further interrogate the poor man. He left shortly after anyways. I think he could tell the comment had upset me. 

My sleep deprived mind raced as I journeyed down the mountainside toward Dwell. Such a scenic drive spoiled by thoughts of John‚Äôs blood ridden face. I gathered myself as I parked at the square, exiting and walking past a group of young children playing in the park. They spun in a circle, hands held as they gleefully sang a classic childhood rhyme: ‚Äúring around the rosie a pocket full of posies, ashes ashes we all fall down‚Äù. They instantly fell to their backs upon the song's conclusion before hopping back up and laughing in unison.

I almost began to laugh at the sight myself. What a picturesque childhood these kids had. A life I didn't know could exist outside a hallmark movie. I turned my attention from them and caught myself moments before I walked into the tallest man I had ever seen. He was dressed head to toe in black, a well worn bible in his right hand. It was the first time I had laid eyes on the town's pastor. The spitting definition of tall, dark and handsome. The small red robed congregation that followed him had stopped just behind him, his smile mirrored in each of their faces.

I began to apologize for nearly running into him but he was quick to dismiss me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs wonderful to finally meet you miss Volk‚Äù he followed up. ‚ÄúMy name is David‚Äù he reached out to shake my hand. ‚ÄúWe are thrilled you chose to move into the family home‚Äù. I mustered as much cheer as I could, complimenting him on the beautiful town in which they lived. He began to introduce the congregation one at a time. My sleep deprived mind forgetting each name as quickly as I heard them. The last woman to approach was beautiful, young and clearly blind. Her cane nearly bounced off my feet as she approached.

‚ÄúAnd last but not least is Miss Mya‚Äù David said as I reached for her hand. She leaned in as I grasped her hand in mine, whispering quietly into my ear. The phrase shook me to my core: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a boy‚Äù. She briefly touched my stomach before walking off. I remained frozen in place, tongue tied as the group bid me farewell and headed down the brick sidewalk that bordered the park. 

‚ÄúYes Miss Volk, it‚Äôs quite common for pregnant women to report more vivid dreams during term, nightmares even‚Äù his answer to my question snapped me back to reality. I hadn‚Äôt been able to shake Mya‚Äôs comment throughout the check in process or the beginning of the visit. The doctor continued ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not completely understood but is thought to have something to do with hormonal fluctuations, as well as disruptions to your sleep cycle‚Äù. His words managed to bring me some relief despite the weirdness of the day's previous encounters. 

I felt conflicted as I drove home. Too many strange occurrences had happened in such a short time. I questioned if the cheery demeanor of the townsfolk was just a front, it had felt as though they had rolled out a red carpet for me since my arrival. Was it genuine, or did they want me lulled into a false sense of security, and why? What did they have to gain? I was so tired I honestly didn't know how to feel, perhaps it was all in my head. I certainly was far from a healthy state of mind. At least the Doctors visit was positive. I had a healthy baby and that was most important.

Things fortunately began to look up over the following months. I was still plagued by nightmares though my recollection of them was much less vivid than in previous weeks. Upon waking I can only seem to recall the feeling of falling and not much more. I have definitely taken on the physical appearance of a pregnant woman, much to the delight of the townsfolk. A ‚Äúgift from god‚Äù I am told over and over. The nursery buildout is complete thanks to Abraham. He has taken on more work in general as I grow larger and less able bodied. There is an old saying that goes something along the lines of ‚Äúit takes a village to raise a child‚Äù. I very much feel that I will have that type of support from everyone in town when the day comes.

In a town like Dwell everyone truly knows one another. You see the same faces every day, everyone on a first name basis. It feels comforting, like I know no strangers here. Oddly enough I have yet to see Mya again since that first meeting. I have so many questions for her, particularly since my last ultrasound confirmed that I am in fact carrying John Jr.

 The days seem to pass by slowly as of late. I have never had this level of free time in my entire adult life. No work, a great caretaker for the house. If there were not so many books at my disposal I would have likely lost my mind by now. I must have finished nearly a hundred since moving in. I tried to pull books from different rooms considering nearly every one of them had an enormous bookshelf. I rarely spent time in Abigail's old room though. It was exactly as she had left it, it felt eerie to be among her most personal belongings. Today however, I decided I would venture in for my book selection.

I carefully perused her bookcase, scanning for something that would peak my interest. It was in the top row that I saw it. A black leather book with a blank spine. I pulled it down and gazed at its empty cover, the first page revealing it was no novel, but rather a diary. Was it wrong to read it? Such personal information it must contain. I debated if I should put it back, briefly. Some secrets are better left unknown, but my curiosity quickly prevailed. I had hardly known Abigail in life, this was my chance to learn more about my late sister in law. I had to take it.

I carried the book to the kitchen, cracking it open to the first entry dated to nearly 4 years ago. She wrote in such a beautiful and cryptic manner. Most of the entries were mundane, consisting of normal day to day life. I recognized most of the names as townsfolk I too saw on a regular basis. As I flipped through the pages a name quickly jumped out. The illusive Mya.

‚ÄúThe sagacious read from my palm, seeing where I find darkness. She confirmed what I have always felt to be true. He was to be born of a Volk. His coming was at hand and in his veins, my own blood‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt know where to even begin. The previous entries had featured heavily her desire to become pregnant. As beautiful as she had been, I had never known her to date. I honestly assumed she was asexual. Was the baby to become a prominent member of Dwell? A spiritual leader perhaps. I was hooked.

 I moved from the kitchen to my favorite recliner in the study. It was apparent I would read this from cover to cover and I wanted to settle in. I flipped through the pages, eagerly scanning her neat handwriting looking for clues as to what this mysterious encounter with Mya could mean. It wasn't long before I saw another recognizable name.

‚ÄúWith this morning came the arrival of brother Jonathan, and with it the harvest, a time when all heads must bow‚Äù . I quickly double checked the entry date, recognizing it as coinciding with one of John‚Äôs ‚Äúbusiness trips‚Äù. He had missed my bosses wedding for this trip, I was certain of the date. Yet another post mortem lie of his coming to light. I would have been fine with him visiting his sister, why had he lied? I read on as tears welled in my eyes.

‚ÄúDavids eyes never shine as bright as in the presence of John, he even stood by his side during sacrament. I know when that glorious day comes that we will stand by his side as well. Blessed it shall be when the earth finally becomes his throne‚Äù. The town's church had already started to feel like a cult to me since moving here. This all but confirmed that. If John had felt he had to hide his pilgrimages home from me then there had to be more going on here. The fact he was even participating in church activities was concerning. He always claimed to be agnostic like me.

As the entries continued the tone grew much darker. Her attempts to become pregnant were always futile, much to her dismay. The final entry was a morbid glimpse into her psyche in the final days. ‚ÄúIt is all too clear that I am not to be his shepherd into this realm. My window to conceive has closed, an inevitable reality of nature. Those who can wait to take the leap on the day are more patient than I. Far preferable it shall be to simply not exist in the meantime. I will smile upon him when that day arrives, but for now I must go‚Äù. 

I slammed the diary shut, blinking my eyes as I readjusted to my surroundings. I had been so enthralled in my reading I had completely lost track of time. It was dark now. Although I had forgotten to eat dinner, the conclusion of the diary had left me so disturbed I had little appetite. I could picture her taking the ‚Äúleap‚Äù as she called it. Plunging to her death off the very cliff where I drank my morning tea. I was fearful for my unborn child then. The town had seemed to have taken too keen an interest in my pregnancy. I knew I must protect him from whatever they wanted. He would never spend a day of his life in Dwell if I had anything to say about it. 

I packed my bags hastily, mostly with clothing, everything else I felt could stay. I wept as I placed them by the front door. I had already uprooted my entire life once and now I was to do it again. This place was too good to be true. As difficult as it was, I had to go. I would leave at dawn and return to the city.

Surprisingly I found sleep quickly that night. Surely having something to do with being utterly exhausted both physically and mentally. It was fortunate considering I wanted to leave early, I was afraid Abraham would try to convince me to stay. I wrote him a short letter thanking him for his help, and to let him know my intentions of leaving. I would work out the details another day, for now I just needed out. I slept soundly until dawn.

 When the morning came I was jarred from my sleep by a noise so full and violent it shook me to my core. It was as though a thousand brass horns bellowed an endless note in unison. I sat upright but a sharp pain sent me back onto my pillow. It was an immense pressure, cramping like I had never felt. I cried out in agony kicking my soaking wet sheets off as I writhed about. I was in labor, nearly 8 weeks early.

I willed myself upright, my damp feet touching the cold hardwood floor. This couldn‚Äôt be real, how could I be so unlucky. The journey down the stairs felt like an eternity. I stopped at multiple points clutching the banister for dear life. The contractions were growing in intensity at an alarming rate. I just needed to get to my phone to call Abe, there was no way I could drive myself in this state. 

I rounded the corner at the bottom of the stairs using the wall to keep myself upright. I had a clear view out the kitchen window and into the backyard. I could make out a familiar and welcomed figure then. It was Abraham staring out over the cliffside. I groaned as I slid the kitchen window open, the sound of the horns nearly knocked me off my feet. I made a futile effort to get his attention, but there was no way I could cut through this otherworldly sound that seemed to echo from the heavens. 

Out the side door I went, clutching my car keys tightly as I made my way. I screamed for Abraham when I could, but I was breathless, doubling over in pain with each step. Finally I got his attention when I was nearly close enough to touch him. ‚ÄúAbe please, the baby we have to‚Äù... My voice trailed off as he turned towards me, tears streamed down his face towards an absolutely crazed smile.

‚ÄúAnd with his arrival trumpets will sound upon all of Zion. Let all of the inhabitants of the land tremble‚Äù! His voice boomed. ‚ÄúAbraham, what in the fuck are you talking about‚Äù? I replied. ‚ÄúWe have to go‚Äù! I insisted through gritted teeth. He made no response. Instead he turned away from me slowly and outstretched his arms to his sides. I gasped as he leapt from the cliff‚Äôs edge, willfully plummeting to his death below.

I stood in shock, mouth agape. My ears began to ring as I stared across the valley towards Dwell. I squinted my eyes at the many dots perched along the cliffside bordering the opposite side of town. It was the townsfolk of Dwell, I watched in horror as they took turns leaping to the ground below. They fell arms outstretched just as Abraham did. There was no effort to brace before impact. An eager acceptance of fate. I turned to shield myself from the sight, mustering every ounce of strength I had to make a break for my car.

It must have taken me 10 minutes to travel the short distance from the cliff to the driveway. The pain felt too excruciating to drive, but I had no choice in the matter. I set towards my car at as fast of a pace as I could manage, stopping multiple times to catch my breath. It was during a short break that I looked up to the sound of tires rolling down the gravel lane. It was the unwelcomed sight of David and Mya barreling directly toward me. I groaned as I set towards my car once again, my shaking hands fumbling with the lock as they skidded to a halt.

I nearly closed the door on David's outstretched hand, locking it as he yanked on the handle. I gazed up at him through tear filled eyes, barely able to make out the wicked smile painted on his face. ‚ÄúAnd where do you think you are going miss Volk‚Äù? He questioned in a playful manner. ‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt another town for miles, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll make it‚Äù. I started my car as he continued on ‚ÄúThe doctor is ready for you, please let us drive you‚Äù.

 I glared up at him through the window ‚ÄúInstead how about you go fuck yourself‚Äù! I shouted as I slammed the car into gear and flew down the bumpy lane. A quick glance at my rearview mirror confirmed they were on my trail. Both vehicles sped down the treacherous mountain road. The pain made staying in my lane a nearly impossible task. I drifted around the tight switchbacks, skidding along the gravel that bordered the roads edge. Somehow I rounded the final corner leading into town, the road there presenting a new kind of obstacle.

The mangled bodies of the town's inhabitants littered the road leading into the square. There were dozens of them, men women and most unfortunately children. I weaved around one mangled corpse after another, grazing the occasional shattered limb as I went. No matter how fast I drove I could not shake them. They remained mere inches from my bumper all the way through town.

 I flew through a sharp turn next to the hardware store, the car's front tires making abrupt contact with one of Dwell's larger male inhabitants. The force of the hit sent shockwaves through my body, as a piece of splintered bone punctured the drivers side front tire. It flattened in seconds.

 My contractions had only grown longer and more painful as we went. My hands clasped the steering wheel in a death grip as I tried my best to perform my breathing techniques. I knew I would never make it to another town before the baby came, it felt like it could be any moment now. Still I refused to yield, compelled onward by a primal desire to save my unborn son. I was in agony.

I tried to push as we began to climb the only road leaving town. It all became too much then. Between the flat tire and the insufferable pain shooting throughout my body I lost control. The car spun wildly, creeping closer to the cliffside with each rotation. I lost the road at a high rate of speed, the car careening off a sheer cliff face. Time slowed down in that free fall, my life flashing before my eyes as we travelled down. I could only think of how I failed my unborn son as I watched the treetops below approaching through the windshield. The impact was as violent as it was brief, the blackness that followed was absolute.

When I opened my eyes the world was still. The blaring of the horns had ceased, the calming sound of David's voice echoed from the church stairs. I was back in the town square. I sat upright, admiring my now flat stomach under my red robe. I felt no fear or confusion in the moment, my pain replaced with an intense euphoria the likes of which I had never felt. It was pure ecstacy. The townsfolk stood at attention towards the church's steps, everyone donning the same red robes as I. There was not so much as a single drop of blood to be found on any of them. As if the events of the morning had been no more than a dream.

I walked through their neat and tidy rows, meeting each of their smiling faces with one of my own. They all looked so beautiful, so at peace. I started to laugh uncontrollably as I walked, entirely unable to contain my bliss. I turned my attention towards the steps and then to David who stood at the top. To his left stood Abigail, her long blonde hair gracefully blowing in the breeze. To his right was my John, he beamed down at me as I approached. My eyes welled at the sight, he looked even more handsome than in my memories. 

In David's hands was the most beautiful child I had ever laid eyes on. I took in every inch of his perfect little body as I ascended the stairs. I gleefully gazed upon his dark pointed hooves, scanning upwards towards the curled horns that formed atop his head. He was perfect. Tears flowed from my face as I smiled down at him. I took him into my arms gently rocking him back and forth. ‚ÄúHello John‚Äù.

1n7hokm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOlaiZQjwdY,Ethiopia Plans $6B Mega Airport Near Bishoftu to Handle 100M Passengers,"Ethiopian Airlines is pushing ahead with a $6 billion mega airport near Bishoftu, about 40 km from Addis. Covering 35 square km, it‚Äôs designed to handle over 100 million passengers a year, which would put it in the same league as the busiest airports in the world.

Bole is already maxing out at around 25 million passengers annually, and Ethiopian Airlines carried more than 17 million last year. The new airport is meant to take the pressure off and give the country room to grow. The first phase, expected to be ready by 2029, will handle 60 million passengers. Once expanded, the full project will include four runways, space for 270 aircraft, and advanced digital systems to streamline the passenger experience.

What makes this project more than just another big airport is Ethiopia‚Äôs position on the map. Sitting between Africa, Europe, and Asia, the country has a real chance to cement itself as a global transit hub. The construction alone is set to create tens of thousands of jobs, and once it‚Äôs running, the airport could help double tourist arrivals, boost exports like coffee and flowers, and draw more foreign investment.

The design team by Dubai-based Dar al-Handasah, working with Zaha Hadid Architects is promising a modern, sustainable airport that uses renewable energy, efficient building systems, and smart security. If all goes as planned, Ethiopia could be operating one of the largest airports in the world by the end of the decade.",1,1756912822.0,Ethiopia,1,1.0,False

Ineffable is the void left behind from the death of a spouse. It is a darkness so oppressive, so absolute that it fills each and every moment. I still have no memory of the day I found him. A defense mechanism of my own mind against the trauma of that day. Even the subsequent weeks have been a blur. Life in a waking dream, and dear god it has been busy. Endless stacks of paperwork, police reports, lawyers and funeral directors. There is hardly time to grieve.


 John left no family or friends behind in this world. We had each other and that was all we needed. Everything since his passing has been my solo burden to bear. In life he seemed to only have time for me and his work. I never questioned it. Hell, I relished every moment. With his job came travel, at times for long stretches, but he more than made up for it when he was home. His memory haunts me in every inch of this city consequently. Handheld evening walks in the park, countless dinner dates, a never ending search for that perfect cup of pour over coffee. There is not a place worth being that we hadn't experienced. A myriad of memories together. No more.

I knew immediately I had to leave this place, to escape the constant reminders of him. I wanted solitude in my grief. The sympathetic glances from neighbors, as well intentioned as they may have been, only served as a grim reminder. I needed a fresh start, a place where I knew nobody. I just didn't know where that could be.

It rained the day I buried him. A brutal and unrelenting rain that didn't let up until the darkest hours of night. I stayed up until dawn, I did most of the time back then. That night I found myself in the attic, a bottle of whisky at my side as I poured through boxes of old photographs. In a madness I had strewn them across the floor until I sat surrounded, an island in a sea of images. It was in the final box that I found it.

It was the oldest photo of John I had ever seen, and one of the few images of his entire family together. It was a picture long faded by time. The four of them pressed closely together in front of their towering red brick home, all framed by a gorgeous green mountain backdrop. I knew the matching red robes they wore to be religious in nature. Both of John‚Äôs parents were pastors after all.

I studied every detail of the photo for what felt like an hour, tracing my thumbs around its worn edges as I pondered. They all looked so stern, almost as if they were aware of the lifetime of tragedy that would befall their family. There was something magnetic about that red brick home, as if it contained the answers to all my problems. 

  John‚Äôs grandparents built that home, as well as the first church in Dwell. It was a new town then, a mining town like so many other Appalachian settlements. John didn't talk about his family all that much. It was understandable with how much of its history was plagued by death. I knew his grandparents passed away at a young age, an unfortunate family tradition that did not stop with them. A car wreck took both of his parents when he was in college. I never even had a chance to meet them. We bonded because of that initially. I had been long estranged from my family. They might as well have been dead. We were truly kindred spirits, two loners who had found their other half. He was everything to me.

 After the death of his parents, the house was inherited by his older sister Abigail. A reclusive and mysterious woman to me. I had only met her a single time at our wedding. She seemed to barely leave the family home. When she took her life last spring the house was passed onto John. The last remaining branch of a devastated family tree.

I had yet to visit the property, not even while she was alive. Something always seemed to come up despite my best efforts. John had made it clear he had no intention of selling the house. We talked of retiring there, of passing it along to our future children. At that moment it suddenly became clear what I must do. The house would stay with the family, it would stay with me. I needed an escape after all. 


Our current home sold almost as soon as it was put on market. I was not surprised  in the least, being that it was a gorgeous Victorian era build. We had put so much work into it over the past decade, and the neighborhood had only become more desirable year after year. My stress had not waned one bit during the selling process, deciding what to keep and what to donate. Each belonging holding a memory of us, of John. I attributed my morning vomiting bouts as stress related at first. With everything going on it seemed logical, as did me losing track of when I last had my period. 

As the days went on I began to have a suspicion my symptoms weren't stress related at all. I didn't want to believe the at home test at first. It didn't feel real until my doctor verified it. I felt so numb and conflicted upon her confirmation. How could I do this alone? We had wanted children but not like this. This was not part of the plan.

The human spirit is remarkable in its resilience however. With each passing day I found assurance in my situation. I felt excited even. As godless as I am I could see this for the blessing it was. With how much had been taken from me I was due to receive positive news. It was as if a small piece of John was to live on.

My mood continued to lift with each belonging I let go of. Every donated item a small weight off my heavy and fatigued shoulders. I even caught myself smiling again as I began to think of potential baby names. I debated many girl names, but I secretly hoped it would be a boy. I had a name already picked out for that situation: John.

 When the day finally arrived the movers had a light day loading the truck. I had given away almost everything we owned. I knew the house in Dwell was fully furnished, John had told me as much. I felt excitement as I followed them out of that crowded city. A fresh start awaited me, a rural oasis where I hoped life would move at a slower pace.

The mountains rose higher the further we drove. Gorgeous heavily wooded peaks dominated the landscape. Clear pristine waterways flowed abundantly, nurturing veins for the lush vegetation that seemed to grow on every surface. I felt a profound sense of awe as we rounded every corner. I had seen Appalacia, but not like this. So pure and rural, absolutely untamed.

The occasional towns we passed were a stark and bleak contrast to the beautiful countryside however. Impoverished and largely abandoned communities tucked into deep valleys. Industry had long left the area as did the majority of the people. Those left behind seemed truly trapped, left with limited economic opportunity. Too poor to escape. It seemed a hopeless existence, the kind that allows addiction and crime to thrive. I had heard the town of Dwell had escaped the fate of these other communities. John always spoke of the town so fondly. I hoped this would be the case.

Nothing could have prepared me for the sheer opulence I saw as we rounded the bend and descended into Dwell that first time. It looked like a postcard. Steep cliffsides bordered the town's perimeter. Large well maintained homes dotted the surrounding landscape. The cobblestone streets of the town centre straddled either side of a mighty river. We passed dozens of thriving shops as we drove through the square, bakeries, grocers, restaurants, there was everything one could desire. In the dead center of town stood a massive and ornate church, its narrow red brick peaks dwarfing the rest of the town's buildings. I marveled at the massive stained glass windows as we passed. It had to have been the church John‚Äôs grandparents built, it was the only church in town after all.

Even the townsfolk of Dwell looked different. So clean, so old fashioned in their dress. Women wore long flowing dresses, the men finely tailored suits. Young children frolicked across spacious green parks without so much as single hair on their heads out of place. I didn't think places like this existed anymore. ‚ÄúI could die in this town‚Äù I muttered to myself as we turned off onto a steep switchback that would lead us to our final destination.

I let out an audible gasp upon seeing the red brick home for the first time. It was even more sprawling and elegant than the photo had made it seem. Three stories of beautifully maintained brick and stone, immaculate arched windows, and steep tall slate roofs. I was especially surprised at how well manicured the grounds were. The grass was cut, hedges trimmed and a wide array of flowers were thoughtfully placed around the front porch. It was clear someone was caring for the property this past year.

The movers wasted no time unloading. They were behind me with boxes in hand as soon as I turned the key and opened the massive oak front door. I was prepared for cobwebs and dust, but much to my surprise the interior mirrored the immaculate nature of the landscaping. I felt a sense of wonder as I started about the maze of large and decadently furnished rooms that made up the first floor. I marveled at the antique pieces, the stone fireplaces, the floor to ceiling bookcases. Each room seemed more grand than the last. I loved the home immediately.

‚ÄúYou can take a break if you need, the house is old, not haunted‚Äù I jokingly remarked towards the frantic pace of the movers. ‚ÄúJust a long drive home is all ma‚Äôam‚Äù the older of the two replied without missing a beat. ‚ÄúYou sure you don't want us to take any of these upstairs‚Äù?  I assured him they were fine stacked near the entrance. I knew it would take some time to find a home for everything I had brought, and time I had. 

I peered through the front door and watched as the truck headed down the long wooded lane then onto the steep mountain road that led us here. I was back in an all too familiar place now, I was alone. It was not for long however. As I set about unpacking I heard a loud knock on the front door. I opened it up to a tall and thinly framed old man. He politely removed his hat placing it to his chest, a smile forming on his wrinkled face.

‚ÄúGood evening miss Volk‚Äù he said as he extended his right hand forward. ‚ÄúPlease, you can call me Leah‚Äù I responded, shaking his extended hand. ‚ÄúMy name is Abraham, my deepest condolences for your loss‚Äù. I managed a halfhearted smile as he continued on. ‚ÄúJonathan placed me in charge of maintaining the property after his sister passed last spring, I hope it is to your liking‚Äù. I was quick to affirm the pristine condition of the property both inside and out. ‚ÄúIt couldn't have been just you doing all of this‚Äù? I exclaimed. ‚ÄúYes ma‚Äôam, we take care of our own here in Dwell‚Äù. I found it odd that John had made no mention of anyone looking after the place, but I was certainly grateful that he had. ‚ÄúDo I owe you anything for all this hard work Abe‚Äù? I motioned towards my purse hanging near the doorway. ‚ÄúHeavens no‚Äù! He exclaimed ‚ÄúAfter all your family has done for this town, it's the least I could do‚Äù. 

I thanked him again but was cut off before I could finish ‚ÄúDwell owes our strong sense of faith to the Volks you know, they built the church after all. Yes ma‚Äôam god takes a special liking to our little town‚Äù his smile widened even further as he spoke. ‚ÄúWell it's a beautiful town‚Äù I said, returning his smile.  ‚ÄúListen I don‚Äôt wanna take up all your time, I know you're busy, but if you ever need anything I'm your closest neighbor just right down the way‚Äù. He motioned back down the road towards town. ‚ÄúNot too many folks live up this ways, I‚Äôm the only other house fore you get into town, brick place like this, only a lot smaller‚Äù. I nodded and assured him I wouldn't hesitate to ask if I needed him. I habitually locked the door behind him as he left, old habits from city life. I supposed most people didn't feel the need to lock up here. Maybe someday I would feel the same sense of security.

My first week in Dwell flew by. I busied myself unpacking and exploring the town. Everyone was so nice, in an almost overbearing way. I don't think they got to see a lot of out of towners in such an isolated community. Almost every person I met inquired if I would be attending church that Sunday. I must have been the only godless soul in the entirety of town. I spent most mornings drinking herbal tea and overlooking the steep cliff face that bordered my backyard. The view was absolutely breaktaking, though I knew I would need to build a fence along its edge before the little one became mobile.

With the second week came the start of the nightmares. In the past I have never been able to recall my dreams. Even when my alarm wrenches me from a deep slumber the recollection is fleeting, gone before I even sit up. These are something else entirely. They are as vivid as they are persistent. 

The dream is the same each night. I am a silent spectator viewing John‚Äôs last moments alive. It‚Äôs as if I am a ghost following him about his day. It always begins the same, I trail him as he walks throughout our home. I want to grab him, tell him how much I miss him. My cries fall on deaf ears, my hands always a pace too far behind to make contact. I watch with confusion as he moves from room to room throwing valuables into a large duffel bag as he goes. Jewelry, cash, his prized rolex. I chase him to the back door, stopping as it slams in my face. I reach for the door knob wanting nothing more than to run after him, but it refuses to turn. I see him leave and then return quickly. He exits his vehicle smashing out a glass pane in the patio door before he enters.

I try to plead with him as he walks up the staircase towards his office. I feel so confused and helpless as I enter behind him. Immediately he violently overturns his office furniture, scattering paperwork to the floor as he flips his heavy desk. I want to scream as he stares at himself in the mirror, his breath heavy from the aggressive dismantling of the room. He smiles at his reflection before relentlessly striking himself, not ceasing until his features are a bloody pulp. Only then does he turn towards me, blood pouring like a faucet from his smashed nose. He finally seems to acknowledge my presence through his maniacal gaze. I squint through tears in a final futile attempt to grab him, but he leaps backwards through the third story office window, falling just out of my grasp.

 John was murdered. I knew this, the police confirmed it. A burglary gone wrong. The nightmares fully revived my memory of finding him in a pool of blood on our back patio. I can see his horribly disfigured face again, a memory I loathed regaining. No person could do that to themselves, especially him. I cannot grasp why my unconscious mind has re-invented the scenario this way. Every night is torture. I cannot recall ever having the same dream twice in all my life. I have lived this nightmare every night this week, in more detail each time.

I wondered if my pregnant hormonal mind could be the root of this? Perhaps it was the forgotten memory of finding him manifesting itself in my dreams. My first doctor's appointment since the move was set for the following day. I would ask the doctor then. 

I stayed up reading until dawn that night, fearful of what would come to me in my sleep. With the sunrise came the usual visit from Abraham. That sweet man seemed to have some new chores to attend to each day. I don't know what I would do without him. He was so helpful in guiding me on how to manage such a property, his conversations served as a welcomed distraction from my nightly terrors.

  I greeted him each morning with a hot cup of tea, a small token of gratitude for his hard work. Today as we sat watching the sunrise I inquired if he could build a fence along the perimeter of the cliff. I didn‚Äôt tell him it was for the safety of my unborn child, I hadn‚Äôt even told anyone I was pregnant yet. ‚ÄúOf course‚Äù he replied ‚Äúlong overdue if you ask me, this is where Mr. and Mrs Volk fell after all‚Äù. His words caused me to nearly choke on my tea. ‚ÄúI thought it was a car accident‚Äù? I asked. Abe looked away for a moment before replying ‚Äúno ma‚Äôam I remember it like it was yesterday‚Äù. I had so many questions.

Why had John lied? How do two people just ‚Äúfall off‚Äù a cliff? I didn't bother to further interrogate the poor man. He left shortly after anyways. I think he could tell the comment had upset me. 

My sleep deprived mind raced as I journeyed down the mountainside toward Dwell. Such a scenic drive spoiled by thoughts of John‚Äôs blood ridden face. I gathered myself as I parked at the square, exiting and walking past a group of young children playing in the park. They spun in a circle, hands held as they gleefully sang a classic childhood rhyme: ‚Äúring around the rosie a pocket full of posies, ashes ashes we all fall down‚Äù. They instantly fell to their backs upon the song's conclusion before hopping back up and laughing in unison.

I almost began to laugh at the sight myself. What a picturesque childhood these kids had. A life I didn't know could exist outside a hallmark movie. I turned my attention from them and caught myself moments before I walked into the tallest man I had ever seen. He was dressed head to toe in black, a well worn bible in his right hand. It was the first time I had laid eyes on the town's pastor. The spitting definition of tall, dark and handsome. The small red robed congregation that followed him had stopped just behind him, his smile mirrored in each of their faces.

I began to apologize for nearly running into him but he was quick to dismiss me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs wonderful to finally meet you miss Volk‚Äù he followed up. ‚ÄúMy name is David‚Äù he reached out to shake my hand. ‚ÄúWe are thrilled you chose to move into the family home‚Äù. I mustered as much cheer as I could, complimenting him on the beautiful town in which they lived. He began to introduce the congregation one at a time. My sleep deprived mind forgetting each name as quickly as I heard them. The last woman to approach was beautiful, young and clearly blind. Her cane nearly bounced off my feet as she approached.

‚ÄúAnd last but not least is Miss Mya‚Äù David said as I reached for her hand. She leaned in as I grasped her hand in mine, whispering quietly into my ear. The phrase shook me to my core: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a boy‚Äù. She briefly touched my stomach before walking off. I remained frozen in place, tongue tied as the group bid me farewell and headed down the brick sidewalk that bordered the park. 

‚ÄúYes Miss Volk, it‚Äôs quite common for pregnant women to report more vivid dreams during term, nightmares even‚Äù his answer to my question snapped me back to reality. I hadn‚Äôt been able to shake Mya‚Äôs comment throughout the check in process or the beginning of the visit. The doctor continued ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not completely understood but is thought to have something to do with hormonal fluctuations, as well as disruptions to your sleep cycle‚Äù. His words managed to bring me some relief despite the weirdness of the day's previous encounters. 

I felt conflicted as I drove home. Too many strange occurrences had happened in such a short time. I questioned if the cheery demeanor of the townsfolk was just a front, it had felt as though they had rolled out a red carpet for me since my arrival. Was it genuine, or did they want me lulled into a false sense of security, and why? What did they have to gain? I was so tired I honestly didn't know how to feel, perhaps it was all in my head. I certainly was far from a healthy state of mind. At least the Doctors visit was positive. I had a healthy baby and that was most important.

Things fortunately began to look up over the following months. I was still plagued by nightmares though my recollection of them was much less vivid than in previous weeks. Upon waking I can only seem to recall the feeling of falling and not much more. I have definitely taken on the physical appearance of a pregnant woman, much to the delight of the townsfolk. A ‚Äúgift from god‚Äù I am told over and over. The nursery buildout is complete thanks to Abraham. He has taken on more work in general as I grow larger and less able bodied. There is an old saying that goes something along the lines of ‚Äúit takes a village to raise a child‚Äù. I very much feel that I will have that type of support from everyone in town when the day comes.

In a town like Dwell everyone truly knows one another. You see the same faces every day, everyone on a first name basis. It feels comforting, like I know no strangers here. Oddly enough I have yet to see Mya again since that first meeting. I have so many questions for her, particularly since my last ultrasound confirmed that I am in fact carrying John Jr.

 The days seem to pass by slowly as of late. I have never had this level of free time in my entire adult life. No work, a great caretaker for the house. If there were not so many books at my disposal I would have likely lost my mind by now. I must have finished nearly a hundred since moving in. I tried to pull books from different rooms considering nearly every one of them had an enormous bookshelf. I rarely spent time in Abigail's old room though. It was exactly as she had left it, it felt eerie to be among her most personal belongings. Today however, I decided I would venture in for my book selection.

I carefully perused her bookcase, scanning for something that would peak my interest. It was in the top row that I saw it. A black leather book with a blank spine. I pulled it down and gazed at its empty cover, the first page revealing it was no novel, but rather a diary. Was it wrong to read it? Such personal information it must contain. I debated if I should put it back, briefly. Some secrets are better left unknown, but my curiosity quickly prevailed. I had hardly known Abigail in life, this was my chance to learn more about my late sister in law. I had to take it.

I carried the book to the kitchen, cracking it open to the first entry dated to nearly 4 years ago. She wrote in such a beautiful and cryptic manner. Most of the entries were mundane, consisting of normal day to day life. I recognized most of the names as townsfolk I too saw on a regular basis. As I flipped through the pages a name quickly jumped out. The illusive Mya.

‚ÄúThe sagacious read from my palm, seeing where I find darkness. She confirmed what I have always felt to be true. He was to be born of a Volk. His coming was at hand and in his veins, my own blood‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt know where to even begin. The previous entries had featured heavily her desire to become pregnant. As beautiful as she had been, I had never known her to date. I honestly assumed she was asexual. Was the baby to become a prominent member of Dwell? A spiritual leader perhaps. I was hooked.

 I moved from the kitchen to my favorite recliner in the study. It was apparent I would read this from cover to cover and I wanted to settle in. I flipped through the pages, eagerly scanning her neat handwriting looking for clues as to what this mysterious encounter with Mya could mean. It wasn't long before I saw another recognizable name.

‚ÄúWith this morning came the arrival of brother Jonathan, and with it the harvest, a time when all heads must bow‚Äù . I quickly double checked the entry date, recognizing it as coinciding with one of John‚Äôs ‚Äúbusiness trips‚Äù. He had missed my bosses wedding for this trip, I was certain of the date. Yet another post mortem lie of his coming to light. I would have been fine with him visiting his sister, why had he lied? I read on as tears welled in my eyes.

‚ÄúDavids eyes never shine as bright as in the presence of John, he even stood by his side during sacrament. I know when that glorious day comes that we will stand by his side as well. Blessed it shall be when the earth finally becomes his throne‚Äù. The town's church had already started to feel like a cult to me since moving here. This all but confirmed that. If John had felt he had to hide his pilgrimages home from me then there had to be more going on here. The fact he was even participating in church activities was concerning. He always claimed to be agnostic like me.

As the entries continued the tone grew much darker. Her attempts to become pregnant were always futile, much to her dismay. The final entry was a morbid glimpse into her psyche in the final days. ‚ÄúIt is all too clear that I am not to be his shepherd into this realm. My window to conceive has closed, an inevitable reality of nature. Those who can wait to take the leap on the day are more patient than I. Far preferable it shall be to simply not exist in the meantime. I will smile upon him when that day arrives, but for now I must go‚Äù. 

I slammed the diary shut, blinking my eyes as I readjusted to my surroundings. I had been so enthralled in my reading I had completely lost track of time. It was dark now. Although I had forgotten to eat dinner, the conclusion of the diary had left me so disturbed I had little appetite. I could picture her taking the ‚Äúleap‚Äù as she called it. Plunging to her death off the very cliff where I drank my morning tea. I was fearful for my unborn child then. The town had seemed to have taken too keen an interest in my pregnancy. I knew I must protect him from whatever they wanted. He would never spend a day of his life in Dwell if I had anything to say about it. 

I packed my bags hastily, mostly with clothing, everything else I felt could stay. I wept as I placed them by the front door. I had already uprooted my entire life once and now I was to do it again. This place was too good to be true. As difficult as it was, I had to go. I would leave at dawn and return to the city.

Surprisingly I found sleep quickly that night. Surely having something to do with being utterly exhausted both physically and mentally. It was fortunate considering I wanted to leave early, I was afraid Abraham would try to convince me to stay. I wrote him a short letter thanking him for his help, and to let him know my intentions of leaving. I would work out the details another day, for now I just needed out. I slept soundly until dawn.

 When the morning came I was jarred from my sleep by a noise so full and violent it shook me to my core. It was as though a thousand brass horns bellowed an endless note in unison. I sat upright but a sharp pain sent me back onto my pillow. It was an immense pressure, cramping like I had never felt. I cried out in agony kicking my soaking wet sheets off as I writhed about. I was in labor, nearly 8 weeks early.

I willed myself upright, my damp feet touching the cold hardwood floor. This couldn‚Äôt be real, how could I be so unlucky. The journey down the stairs felt like an eternity. I stopped at multiple points clutching the banister for dear life. The contractions were growing in intensity at an alarming rate. I just needed to get to my phone to call Abe, there was no way I could drive myself in this state. 

I rounded the corner at the bottom of the stairs using the wall to keep myself upright. I had a clear view out the kitchen window and into the backyard. I could make out a familiar and welcomed figure then. It was Abraham staring out over the cliffside. I groaned as I slid the kitchen window open, the sound of the horns nearly knocked me off my feet. I made a futile effort to get his attention, but there was no way I could cut through this otherworldly sound that seemed to echo from the heavens. 

Out the side door I went, clutching my car keys tightly as I made my way. I screamed for Abraham when I could, but I was breathless, doubling over in pain with each step. Finally I got his attention when I was nearly close enough to touch him. ‚ÄúAbe please, the baby we have to‚Äù... My voice trailed off as he turned towards me, tears streamed down his face towards an absolutely crazed smile.

‚ÄúAnd with his arrival trumpets will sound upon all of Zion. Let all of the inhabitants of the land tremble‚Äù! His voice boomed. ‚ÄúAbraham, what in the fuck are you talking about‚Äù? I replied. ‚ÄúWe have to go‚Äù! I insisted through gritted teeth. He made no response. Instead he turned away from me slowly and outstretched his arms to his sides. I gasped as he leapt from the cliff‚Äôs edge, willfully plummeting to his death below.

I stood in shock, mouth agape. My ears began to ring as I stared across the valley towards Dwell. I squinted my eyes at the many dots perched along the cliffside bordering the opposite side of town. It was the townsfolk of Dwell, I watched in horror as they took turns leaping to the ground below. They fell arms outstretched just as Abraham did. There was no effort to brace before impact. An eager acceptance of fate. I turned to shield myself from the sight, mustering every ounce of strength I had to make a break for my car.

It must have taken me 10 minutes to travel the short distance from the cliff to the driveway. The pain felt too excruciating to drive, but I had no choice in the matter. I set towards my car at as fast of a pace as I could manage, stopping multiple times to catch my breath. It was during a short break that I looked up to the sound of tires rolling down the gravel lane. It was the unwelcomed sight of David and Mya barreling directly toward me. I groaned as I set towards my car once again, my shaking hands fumbling with the lock as they skidded to a halt.

I nearly closed the door on David's outstretched hand, locking it as he yanked on the handle. I gazed up at him through tear filled eyes, barely able to make out the wicked smile painted on his face. ‚ÄúAnd where do you think you are going miss Volk‚Äù? He questioned in a playful manner. ‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt another town for miles, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll make it‚Äù. I started my car as he continued on ‚ÄúThe doctor is ready for you, please let us drive you‚Äù.

 I glared up at him through the window ‚ÄúInstead how about you go fuck yourself‚Äù! I shouted as I slammed the car into gear and flew down the bumpy lane. A quick glance at my rearview mirror confirmed they were on my trail. Both vehicles sped down the treacherous mountain road. The pain made staying in my lane a nearly impossible task. I drifted around the tight switchbacks, skidding along the gravel that bordered the roads edge. Somehow I rounded the final corner leading into town, the road there presenting a new kind of obstacle.

The mangled bodies of the town's inhabitants littered the road leading into the square. There were dozens of them, men women and most unfortunately children. I weaved around one mangled corpse after another, grazing the occasional shattered limb as I went. No matter how fast I drove I could not shake them. They remained mere inches from my bumper all the way through town.

 I flew through a sharp turn next to the hardware store, the car's front tires making abrupt contact with one of Dwell's larger male inhabitants. The force of the hit sent shockwaves through my body, as a piece of splintered bone punctured the drivers side front tire. It flattened in seconds.

 My contractions had only grown longer and more painful as we went. My hands clasped the steering wheel in a death grip as I tried my best to perform my breathing techniques. I knew I would never make it to another town before the baby came, it felt like it could be any moment now. Still I refused to yield, compelled onward by a primal desire to save my unborn son. I was in agony.

I tried to push as we began to climb the only road leaving town. It all became too much then. Between the flat tire and the insufferable pain shooting throughout my body I lost control. The car spun wildly, creeping closer to the cliffside with each rotation. I lost the road at a high rate of speed, the car careening off a sheer cliff face. Time slowed down in that free fall, my life flashing before my eyes as we travelled down. I could only think of how I failed my unborn son as I watched the treetops below approaching through the windshield. The impact was as violent as it was brief, the blackness that followed was absolute.

When I opened my eyes the world was still. The blaring of the horns had ceased, the calming sound of David's voice echoed from the church stairs. I was back in the town square. I sat upright, admiring my now flat stomach under my red robe. I felt no fear or confusion in the moment, my pain replaced with an intense euphoria the likes of which I had never felt. It was pure ecstacy. The townsfolk stood at attention towards the church's steps, everyone donning the same red robes as I. There was not so much as a single drop of blood to be found on any of them. As if the events of the morning had been no more than a dream.

I walked through their neat and tidy rows, meeting each of their smiling faces with one of my own. They all looked so beautiful, so at peace. I started to laugh uncontrollably as I walked, entirely unable to contain my bliss. I turned my attention towards the steps and then to David who stood at the top. To his left stood Abigail, her long blonde hair gracefully blowing in the breeze. To his right was my John, he beamed down at me as I approached. My eyes welled at the sight, he looked even more handsome than in my memories. 

In David's hands was the most beautiful child I had ever laid eyes on. I took in every inch of his perfect little body as I ascended the stairs. I gleefully gazed upon his dark pointed hooves, scanning upwards towards the curled horns that formed atop his head. He was perfect. Tears flowed from my face as I smiled down at him. I took him into my arms gently rocking him back and forth. ‚ÄúHello John‚Äù.

This was by far the worst job experience I‚Äôve ever had. Employees were denied proper breaks, even during long and exhausting shifts. Management was incompetent, disorganized, and unwilling to support staff in any meaningful way. We were pressured to work while sick, which created an unsafe and unhealthy environment. Managers ignored complaints about creepy or inappropriate customers, leaving baristas to handle uncomfortable situations on their own. Job security was nonexistent ‚Äî employees who had been working there for months were suddenly let go without warning or explanation. On top of everything, we were told not to talk to each other or have any fun while working, which made shifts feel even more miserable. The lack of accountability, respect, and basic decency made this workplace toxic and draining. Morale was always low, turnover was constant, and there were no opportunities for recognition or growth. I would strongly discourage anyone from working here.

The owners themselves were cold, unapproachable, and not kind toward their employees. When customer complaints came in, there was no effort to retrain staff or provide clear direction ‚Äî instead, we were simply expected to improve without support. This created an environment of fear and frustration, where workers felt disposable and undervalued.

1n7hm4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/POSTcontentARG/comments/1n7hm4w/choosing_the_right_compostable_pouch_supplier_for/,Choosing the Right Compostable Pouch Supplier for Sustainable Packaging,"The growing awareness of environmental issues and the global push to reduce plastic waste have accelerated the demand for eco-friendly packaging solutions. Among the most innovative options available today are compostable pouches, which serve as sustainable alternatives to traditional plastic packaging. These pouches, often made from renewable plant-based materials such as cornstarch, sugarcane, or cellulose, break down naturally in composting environments without leaving harmful residues. As a result, businesses across industries, from food and beverages to cosmetics and retail, are turning to **compostable pouch suppliers** to meet their sustainability goals. Choosing the right supplier is no longer just about securing packaging‚Äîit‚Äôs about forming a partnership that aligns with your brand‚Äôs commitment to the environment.

One of the primary factors to consider when selecting a [**compostable pouch supplier**](https://bowepack.com/pages/compostable-packaging) is the quality and reliability of their products. Not all compostable packaging is created equal, and the durability, shelf life, and composting efficiency can vary depending on the materials and production methods used. A reputable supplier should be able to provide certification from recognized environmental organizations, proving that their pouches meet international compostability standards such as ASTM D6400, EN 13432, or OK Compost. This ensures that the pouches will degrade in appropriate conditions and that they are safe for both consumers and the environment. A strong supplier will also offer pouches that maintain product freshness and safety, making them suitable for items like coffee, snacks, spices, or even non-food products.

Beyond product quality, customization options are another critical factor in choosing the best compostable pouch supplier. Businesses today are looking for packaging that not only protects their goods but also enhances their brand image. A skilled supplier can offer **custom compostable pouches** with various printing techniques, finishes, and sizes to reflect a brand‚Äôs unique identity. Whether it‚Äôs a vibrant logo, eye-catching colors, or minimalist designs, custom pouches give companies the chance to stand out in a competitive market while staying true to their eco-friendly values. Suppliers who invest in advanced printing technologies can deliver high-resolution designs without compromising the compostable nature of the material. For companies, this means striking a balance between sustainability and branding, ensuring their packaging leaves a lasting impression on customers.

In addition to quality and customization, scalability and supply chain reliability play a vital role in selecting the right compostable pouch supplier. Businesses need partners who can consistently deliver large volumes of packaging without delays or quality inconsistencies. An experienced supplier with a strong production network can accommodate the growth of your business while maintaining eco-friendly standards. Many suppliers also offer flexible order quantities, which is particularly beneficial for small businesses and startups that may not have the capacity to purchase in bulk initially. Furthermore, a supplier with international reach and efficient logistics ensures that packaging can be delivered promptly to different regions, helping businesses maintain smooth operations and customer satisfaction.

Looking ahead, the role of compostable pouch suppliers will become even more significant as regulations around single-use plastics continue to tighten worldwide. Companies that partner with reliable suppliers today will be well-positioned to meet future compliance requirements and demonstrate their leadership in sustainability. By choosing the right supplier, businesses can reduce their environmental impact, strengthen brand loyalty, and appeal to the growing segment of eco-conscious consumers. Ultimately, compostable pouch suppliers are more than packaging providers‚Äîthey are collaborators in building a greener future. For businesses committed to sustainability, investing in eco-friendly packaging through trusted suppliers is not only a smart decision but also an essential step toward creating a lasting positive impact on the planet.",1,1756912670.0,POSTcontentARG,0,1.0,False

He‚Äôs been my best friend since middle school, the kind of guy who never shuts up during soccer matches. We were hanging out at his apartment, talking about a trip we might take, when he said:

‚ÄúMan, if we go to Cusco, I‚Äôm definitely bringing my drone.‚Äù

I laughed, nodded, and kept scrolling on my phone. Not even thirty seconds later, he leaned forward, same grin on his face, and said:

‚ÄúMan, if we go to Cusco, I‚Äôm definitely bringing my drone.‚Äù

Word for word. Same tone. Same laugh afterward.

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou just said that.‚Äù

Diego looked at me like I‚Äôd grown a second head. ‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt. Are you okay?‚Äù

That was the first crack.

The next was my mom calling me by an old nickname she never used. ‚ÄúNicocho‚Äù. She hasn‚Äôt said that since I was five. When I asked her why she suddenly brought it back, she froze for a second, then said, ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about? I‚Äôve always called you that.‚Äù

I brushed it off. Tried to.

But it kept happening.

Laura, my girlfriend, told me one night about this amazing beach we went to together last summer. The thing is, we never went. I remember working all through July. I told her that. She tilted her head, like a doll that doesn‚Äôt quite understand the question, and said:

‚ÄúNo, Nico. Don‚Äôt you remember? It‚Äôs in the script.‚Äù

I laughed nervously. ‚ÄúThe script? What script?‚Äù

But she just smiled, too wide, and kissed my cheek.

It was the caf√© incident that really shook me. There‚Äôs this place near campus where I always order orange juice. That day, the barista, a cheerful girl named Camila, came back with a black coffee.

‚ÄúUh, sorry, I ordered orange juice,‚Äù I said.

She looked straight at me, smile fading, and whispered:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not in the script.‚Äù

Silence. My stomach dropped.

‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù

Camila blinked like nothing had happened. ‚ÄúOrange juice, right? Sorry about that!‚Äù She rushed off, leaving me sitting there with a coffee that was still steaming.

I started noticing patterns. Cars on the main avenue stopping at the exact same rhythm. Conversations repeating in the same sequence when I walked past strangers. Even the stray dog by the bookstore, scratching its ear at the same second every afternoon.

One night, I confronted Laura.

‚ÄúI need you to tell me the truth,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on? With you. With everything. Is this real?‚Äù

She was brushing her hair, sitting at my desk. Her hand froze mid-stroke. For a long moment she didn‚Äôt move. Then, without turning around, she said:

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think too much, Nico. It‚Äôs not healthy.‚Äù

Her voice was flat. Mechanical.

I didn‚Äôt sleep that night.

Yesterday was the breaking point. I woke up and found my dad sitting in the chair across from my bed. He wasn‚Äôt supposed to be there. He lives in another city.

‚ÄúDad?‚Äù I said.

He didn‚Äôt answer. Just stared at me. His eyes looked‚Ä¶ wrong. Like glass.

Finally, in a low, distorted voice, he spoke:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre reaching the limit of the environment.‚Äù

I froze.

‚ÄúWhat the hell does that mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt life. It‚Äôs simulation.‚Äù

When he blinked, for the briefest second, I swear I saw a blue screen flicker across his pupils. Like a computer crash.

I bolted out of my room, out of the house. But outside‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt the neighborhood anymore. It was white. Endless. A blank space stretching forever.

And in the middle of it: a glowing door.

I don‚Äôt remember deciding to open it. But I did.

On the other side, I heard a voice‚Äînot my dad‚Äôs, not anyone‚Äôs. Deep, echoing, everywhere at once:

‚ÄúSystem reset. Subject will be reinserted into the simulation.‚Äù

And then‚Äîblack.

I woke up in my bed this morning. Sunlight poured through the curtains. My phone buzzed with messages from Diego, joking about the soccer match that night. Everything looked normal.

Except my dad was still sitting in that chair.

I told myself it had to be a dream, a leftover hallucination from lack of sleep. But then he slowly turned his head toward me. His mouth moved, and I braced for the metallic voice.

Instead, he whispered, almost gently:

‚ÄúNico‚Ä¶ you have to stop asking questions.‚Äù

And then he smiled. Just a normal, tired smile.

For a second, I almost believed it. Almost convinced myself I‚Äôd imagined everything.

But then I remembered Camila at the caf√©. The way her voice dropped, flat and lifeless, when she handed me the wrong drink.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not in the script.‚Äù

He didn't go right after high school for personal reasons, but he is attending now and is currently taking a compressed course (i.e. a 2 year diploma compressed into 3 consecutive semesters) which means he has a heavier course load than most other diplomas, and it's his first and only year in college. 

For context, my boyfriend is an anxious person. He doesn't like big crowds of people, he doesn't necessarily like change/new things, and he especially doesn't like doing nerve-wracking things by himself. He has panic attacks when things become too overwhelming, which have become more frequent as the semester approached. 

Today is his first day, and he has already had a panic attack after his first class. Luckily, he has one friend who is also attending the school as well, but I know he wouldn't confess his anxiety to him anyway.

I am in my second year of university, and because of that, I sort of know how the ""system"" works, since they don't really explain it to you at all in your first year. To help him, I have basically taken over the admin stuff he needs in order for him to be organised as the year goes by. College and university are different, but the fundamentals are usually pretty similar.

I have created a schedule for my boyfriend for all of his classes, including which textbooks are required for each class. I have helped him set up his lockers and his email system, and making sure he checks Brightspace to ensure he has all the information he needs.

I go to his house a couple nights a week, and I sleepover on the weekends. On the days that I'm sleeping over, I try to clean his room for him and make sure his laundry is done so that he's ready for the week, and I'm off on Mondays so I have time to make sure all my own stuff is done too.

I feel like yes, I am doing things to help him, but I don't know how to comfort him. I want to make him feel comfortable, asides from making sure all his tasks are done. I can't tell when he needs space or if he needs space, and I don't want to be too clingy or too distant. Since I'm not always able to physically be with him, I want to know how to make him feel better through text too.

I also want to make sure that the time I'm spending with him is quality time and I want to make sure I'm comforting him physically as well. I visit him at work and bring him coffees every once in a while to ask him how his day is and stuff when we can't spend dedicated time together, because I just want to make sure he's okay.

Is this too much/too clingy? Should I relax a little or do more?

1n7hkfb,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1n7hkfb/what_should_i_do/,What should I do?,"So this year I offered a room on Facebook, I did an interview and he seemed nice. Then I realised I may have made a mistake. 

I‚Äôm 23M and he‚Äôs 31M and let‚Äôs call him Tony. So when I advertised the room, I stated that I am looking for someone who is quiet and able to help with cleaning while also being a clean person themselves. I found a Japanese guy on a working holiday visa and yeah we clicked.

He moved in and I realised he didn‚Äôt really have anything. 
He didn‚Äôt have a job but he said he saved a lot of money in Japan. He also said he was able to pay rent and help with cleaning. 

Then the problems started to arise.

He wasn‚Äôt able to get his funds from his bank account in Japan apparently. The thing I thought about was, WHY DONT YOU HAVE THE FUNDS ALREADY?!!! This caused me to be strict and I told him I don‚Äôt have the money to support you so it did kick him into gear.

Then i got him a job at my restaurant, and it went well so I didn‚Äôt think much of the rent situation until he told me he didn‚Äôt have a TFN so he lost half of his paycheck due to this. This annoyed me.

A week after he moved in, I noticed his room had a bad smell, like a sour smell. I had to beg him for days and days to clean but till this day; he has only cleaned twice.

He doesn‚Äôt clean anything unless he wants to use it. He always forgets to turn the stove off etc.

I clean a toilet, he leaves marks within the next hour. He cooks, he cleans HIS dishes and that‚Äôs it (majority of the time).

He never vacuums and never mops or does anything extra and if I ask him; he‚Äôll say yes but never do it. 

NOW we have an issue

I‚Äôve had multiple girls over but they usually stick to my room and don‚Äôt bother him at all until this one girl who I have a lengthy history with stays over. She cooks, cleans and helps me out sometimes as I‚Äôve been sick the last week and unable to recover. 

I talked to him about it because I could see Tony was visibly upset about her. He said I pay half of everything and she uses it all. If she‚Äôs in the kitchen or the lounge room I can‚Äôt go in there. So I had to tell the girl to chill and back down which she her response was like ok‚Ä¶.I wasn‚Äôt there too much but I just said it doesn‚Äôt make him comfortable.


Now I want to mention within the apartment everything is owned by me. The TV, the video game consoles, the furniture and all appliances are all mine. Tonight after his request for the girl to not be in the common areas too much he has turned on my PS5 (which I said he could use if he wants) has had YouTube on from 6pm to now (1:05am). He has been listening to podcasts, news while he‚Äôs been on his phone playing Pool or Mahjong. I wouldn‚Äôt have an issue if he didn‚Äôt have a problem with the girl I had over. It just seems that now that the girl is completely stuck in my room, he has taken advantage of the things I allow him to do.  

He‚Äôs lying on the couch as if it‚Äôs his bed and lying down on a sombrero hat I got from a restaurant. I have to tell him hey please don‚Äôt lie on the hat.

I was too nice on him in the beginning I feel so now I‚Äôm paying the consequences. As I said he didn‚Äôt have much in the beginning but now he‚Äôs got a job and his life is sorted but I‚Äôve realised that he is kinda taking the piss outta me.

As I was in the kitchen today, I‚Äôve realised he‚Äôs used maybe 80% of my coffee. I have bought 3 jars and he‚Äôs used majority of it. With the way he‚Äôs been using the lounge room today I‚Äôm quite annoyed and frustrated.

1n7hhsx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Curious-Carry-8494/comments/1n7hhsx/custom_flexible_packaging_redefining_modern_brand/,Custom Flexible Packaging: Redefining Modern Brand Presentation,"In the dynamic world of retail and e-commerce, packaging has become more than just a protective layer for products‚Äîit is now a crucial element of branding, customer experience, and sustainability. Among the many packaging innovations, **custom flexible packaging** stands out as one of the most versatile and impactful solutions. Flexible packaging refers to pouches, bags, or wraps made from materials such as films, foils, and laminates, which can be easily molded to fit a variety of products. When customized, this type of packaging allows businesses to combine functionality with unique brand identity, offering a powerful way to capture consumer attention. Whether for food, beverages, personal care, or household items, custom flexible packaging delivers convenience, efficiency, and design freedom that traditional packaging simply cannot match.

One of the biggest advantages of [**custom flexible packaging**](https://bowepack.com/collections/flexible-packaging) is its ability to improve product protection and extend shelf life. Many flexible packaging options are engineered with multi-layer barriers that protect against moisture, oxygen, light, and contaminants, ensuring products remain fresh and safe for longer periods. This makes it especially popular in industries such as food and pharmaceuticals, where product integrity is critical. By customizing these materials, businesses can tailor the level of protection based on their specific products while still achieving a sleek and branded look. For example, coffee roasters can use resealable stand-up pouches that preserve aroma and freshness, while snack companies can opt for lightweight packaging that maintains crispness and taste. The adaptability of flexible packaging ensures both small and large businesses can find solutions that meet their exact needs.

https://preview.redd.it/rz2d8sukuymf1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=e07afa0f42acd9c50a897eca445c567dac52d8da

Custom flexible packaging also plays an important role in elevating a brand‚Äôs marketing and design strategies. With the help of advanced printing technologies, companies can create eye-catching graphics, vibrant colors, and unique textures directly on the packaging material. Unlike generic packaging, customized designs allow businesses to communicate their brand story, values, and product information effectively. This personalization not only attracts consumers on store shelves but also reinforces brand recognition and loyalty. In today‚Äôs competitive marketplace, where consumers are bombarded with choices, custom flexible packaging acts as a silent salesperson, helping brands stand out and connect emotionally with their audience. Furthermore, features such as transparent windows, resealable zippers, and ergonomic shapes enhance customer convenience, making the packaging itself part of the overall product experience.

Sustainability has become a driving force in packaging decisions, and custom flexible packaging can align well with eco-friendly initiatives. Modern advancements in material science have introduced recyclable, biodegradable, and compostable films that reduce environmental impact without compromising performance. Brands that adopt sustainable custom packaging not only reduce waste but also appeal to eco-conscious consumers who prioritize green choices. In addition, flexible packaging typically uses fewer raw materials compared to rigid alternatives like glass or plastic containers, resulting in lighter shipments and lower carbon emissions during transportation. By working with suppliers who offer sustainable customization options, businesses can enhance their corporate social responsibility while still benefiting from innovative packaging design. This positions them as forward-thinking brands committed to environmental stewardship.

Looking forward, the demand for **custom flexible packaging** will continue to grow as consumer preferences, technological advancements, and sustainability goals evolve. Businesses that embrace this packaging trend will enjoy greater brand visibility, improved product protection, and stronger customer engagement. As industries become more competitive, investing in custom packaging solutions can set a brand apart, providing not just a container for products but a medium of storytelling and connection. For companies of all sizes, from startups to global enterprises, custom flexible packaging represents more than a packaging choice‚Äîit is a strategic tool that blends practicality with creativity. In a marketplace where first impressions matter, it ensures products are not only protected but also presented in a way that resonates with modern consumers and leaves a lasting impact.",1,1756912401.0,u_Curious-Carry-8494,0,1.0,False

1n7hh1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/KonohagakureRP/comments/1n7hh1h/a_weight_lifted_ii/,A Weight Lifted II,"The Konoha Cemetery was a generally quiet place this early in the morning, though on this day the air was quite cold in one section, fanning out a chilling breeze across the entire place.  At the nexus of the cold, a young silver haired woman stood at a relatively mundane looking grave site.  No fancy tombstone or ornamentation, no Clan insignia, and from the looks of it very few visitors.  The flowers there were old and long dead, likely from when her brother had last visited before he left the village, probably for good. 

A heavy sigh escaped her as [Akiko's](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/68/89/3d/68893db8753653ebf40bcb03972e3099.jpg) gaze locked on the name present, ‚ÄòMai Tanaka‚Äô, she‚Äôd chosen to be buried under their father‚Äôs last name instead of her own.  Up until recently she‚Äôd had have no idea why her mother would do that given the nature of their split and how much she hated him.  Even in death she was holding to their Clan‚Äôs tradition of secrecy, ‚ÄúYuki‚Äù she spoke softly as if correcting the mistake.  Another sigh, so many mixed emotions flooding through her as she stood.  Part of her wasn‚Äôt‚Äô even sure how she ended up here. 

The walk to the library was now well worn into her brain, but today she chose a different path, stopping to get some coffee from a new shop.  Walking by the cemetery she suddenly felt compelled to go, to visit her mother for the first time since her passing.  The hate and anger that she‚Äôd long felt towards the woman had gradually been eroding since she started on this journey.  Their shared hidden heritage, suddenly there was a good reason for much of how her mother acted during her childhood.  Standing firmly against her ever becoming a shinobi, if not for her father‚Äôs insistence Akiko would likely be a dancer of some note, in Konoha or beyond as her mother intended.  Looking back now it felt like this might‚Äôve been the reason she‚Äôd chosen to push him away, and ultimately why they split up.  As a child such things are hard to perceive but now with a much clearer head it felt almost obvious.  Even with new information she couldn‚Äôt quite reconcile how her mother had treated her.

‚ÄúThere must have been a better way‚Äù she pleaded to no one in particular.  ‚ÄúIf I knew I might‚Äôve listened‚Ä¶‚Äù even she didn‚Äôt believe that.  Every time she danced it was like the winds called to her, like she was missing something, it would never have been enough.

‚ÄúI would‚Äôve tried‚Äù she corrected herself taking a deep breath, she could feel her eyes swelling and did everything she could to resist it. Her resistance was in vain, as tears flowed freely from both eyes.  Place both hands atop the tombstone she sobbed quietly, her shoulders gently rocking, taking deep breathes in and out hoping to calm herself.  After a few moments she pushed off, quickly wiping the tears from her eyes, finally able to let go of a lot what she‚Äôd still been carrying since completing her program.

Akiko brought her hands together, cupping them just so and a small plume of frost began emanating from them, coalescing into a small crystalline flower.  It looked remarkably like the origami flowers Shiori had shown her recently, though much less dangerous.  With a small smile at her creation, she‚Äôd place it atop the tombstone and with a final nod to herself she turned and made her way out of the cemetery. 

________________________________________________

Akiko would make her way to the library from there, for a long day of research as she drew closer and closer to forging a working mirror. She could also be found walking through the village searching for a nice place to eat later in the day.

I 26F went on a vacation with my parents to a touristic marine area, this is maybe the thired time we rent this house. the propriety‚Äôs owner 54M who i met yesterday for the first time was the one who welcomed us. 
We went swimming two hours after coming to our distinction. I was enjoy my time with mom and laughing hard because I was trying to teach her how to use the float. 

The owner approached us and started a conversation with my mom. I kept my interactions simple, so he asked me why don‚Äôt you have a mask for diving. I answered him that I have one but didn‚Äôt bring it this time. he was like ‚Äú oh that‚Äôs unfortunate, this area is like an aquarium. I have one more that you can use, I will give it to you tomorrow ‚Äú so I thanked him and he left (after having a lengthy conversation).  

Today, I woke up sick so I told my parents i am not swimming early as usual. We had our breakfast, then my dad went on a walk and me and my mom we decided to go to the beach and sit there because the weather was not good so we went to see if we can swim later. We were sitting together speaking and everything, and then that man came. He started speaking to us but this time I zoned out. So we were going back home and he followed us . And he suggested he give me a mask and teach how to dive because yesterday I told him that even if I have it I will never go to deep water since I am not a good swimmer ( I get overly anxious and I have some breathing problems so I only swim deeper when I am supervised ). 
when he made the suggestion I got excited. And I was encouraged by my dad so I got dressed and went with him. 
He asked for permission to touch me at the beginning in order to teach me and I consented. He showed me some tricks and how to use the mask perfectly, tell this point everything was good. 
I showed him how I swim and float. In this part started the touching. Let me say he had his Hands all over me ( my calfs, ankles , feet even toes and same to the upper part of my body). thankfully he didn‚Äôt touch my üê±but he kept his hand on my bum (I was wearing my bikini bottoms with a pad and a pair of shorts on top) so I basically felt nothing. 
Although my posture was good he kept me so close and took me to a deeper place, then he stood between my legs and showed me how to use my hands to come or go while sleeping on my back using only my hands . Then he started commending me to go away or come closer and he is still between my legs. so when I come closer to him my private part will be at his waste with my legs widely open. I didn‚Äôt like it so when he tells me to come closer once I reach a certain distance I would try to put down my legs. He wanted me to hug him but I only put my hands at his shoulders and started swimming on my front.
At some point, he asked me about my dad ‚Äú where is he, is he coming ‚Äú and I said yes so he started joking that he needs to keep an eye because if he comes and see him touching me this why he may not like it and thinks it is inappropriate since some parents are ‚Äúconservative‚Äù. 
Before this comment I was playing it dumb because I thought I was overthinking the situation but what he said made my danger alarms go off . 
And luckily my dad came and he saw me , but he had to go back and bring my mom where I am . The owner saw him and stopped all physical contact but when my dad left for a second he told me to show him what I learned while between my legs ( he was standing in a way where he can see people but I had my back to everything) so he started puching and pulling me from my ankles using his force while guiding me how to use my hands. This time I didn‚Äôt like it one bite so by the time he pulled me very close to his waist I faked choking on water so he left me and I took the mask off and finely both my parents came. 
And then he started ordering me from a good distance because my dad was standing in front of him.
I looked at my mom and signed to her. So she called for me and in a low voice told her ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let my dad live me with him ‚Äú. 
He started having lengthy conversations with both my parents. And I was shivering, so he took my hand and told my parents that I must go out of the water and come back .  I was like ‚Äúoh thank you no need you can stay and I will live alone‚Äù but he followed me tell I settled on the chair and went back to them I though this was the end of it but no he came back and brought me to the water again. This time I started swimming closer to my dad and farther from him. Then my mom made a comment that I only drank black coffee for breakfast so he looked at them and said ‚Äúlive her to me I will take care of her‚Äù and his started dragging me out again although I was telling him that I am ok . He said I will take you home so you can have more food and come back. 
This time I told him I am ok I will just sit down for a bit and that‚Äôs it. And I kept looking at my parents, so they came out and my mom lied that she will be preparing the lunch at home for as and we can follow her back after we are done.
 
If you think that was it then no .
I was siting on the sand and my dad came to the chair next to me and that f** uncle was standing in front of me while speaking to my dad for at least for 20 mins. I shut down completely. Tell he left , my dad asked what is going on but I couldn‚Äôt tell him because I know he is overprotective of me. I just said ‚Äúnever live me alone with him‚Äù. 
Later I am going out with mom and I will tell her everything.

Three weeks ago she decided to take a break, and yesterday we chose to end it. Before the break she told me that she feels more like best friends with me, that her romantic feelings are gone, and that she can‚Äôt or doesn‚Äôt want to allow intimacy anymore. During those three weeks I thought a lot about it and hoped things could go back to how they used to be ‚Äì but only if she truly wanted it and wanted me.

When we talked, she said she doesn‚Äôt want to lose me because I‚Äôm her absolute favorite person on earth and try it again. Even though she had said she might want to try again, I realized I couldn‚Äôt under those circumstances because it felt like too little for me. She said that it's never going to be the same for her as it was. 

She‚Äôs also my absolute favorite person, and I can hardly imagine a life without her. She feels the same, and that‚Äôs why she said she hopes we can stay friends, since she would still love to do everything with me ‚Äì vacations, activities, going out for coffee, and so on.

We cried together the whole evening, hugged, and felt close one last time ‚Äì which made it a hundred times harder for me. I was confused, because it all still felt the same: cuddling, kissing, having sex, touching each other. Now I feel broken, with a huge emptiness inside me, and I don‚Äôt know how to live alone again after almost six years, or how to live without her. Everything that once brought me joy feels meaningless, and I have no motivation for anything.

For entry level data analyst jobs,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôd love some feedback on whether my current portfolio is strong enough to begin applying for entry-level data analyst / data science roles.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done so far:
	‚Ä¢	SQL Projects: Completed multiple case studies including Netflix analysis, customer retention, and funnel drop-off metrics. I practiced window functions, joins, CTEs, and advanced queries.
	‚Ä¢	Python Projects: Built an end-to-end ETL pipeline to scrape 5K+ job postings (BeautifulSoup + Selenium), store them in MySQL with SQLAlchemy, and analyze salary/skills demand. Also did EDA with Pandas/NumPy (e.g., Coffee Sales dataset, Online Retail).
	‚Ä¢	Visualization: Created dashboards in Tableau and Power BI for salary trends, repeat purchases, and EV adoption insights.
	‚Ä¢	Cloud/Big Data Tools: Started learning Azure Data Factory, Databricks (PySpark)
	‚Ä¢	EDA Practice: Recently working on messy Kaggle datasets (e.g., Coffee Sales, Used Car Prices, Flight Delays) to build intuition for wrangling, feature engineering, and visualization. These eda practices are just for understanding EDA and not resume project. 

Main project: 

	‚Ä¢	Job Market Data Pipeline : Collected job postings using both web scraping (BeautifulSoup + Selenium) and the apify API. Built an ingestion pipeline (coded yesterday) that can take any incoming file, clean it, and transform it into a normalized, consistent schema. Automated ETL into MySQL with SQLAlchemy, then analyzed salary trends, skill demand, and remote vs onsite roles. Built dashboards in Tableau to present the insights.

	‚Ä¢	EV Adoption Analysis: Used Kaggle datasets to explore year-over-year adoption rates, vehicle range trends, CAGR, and pivot tables to identify growth patterns.
	‚Ä¢	Netflix SQL Project: Ran advanced SQL analysis on a Netflix dataset (window functions, CTEs, ranking) to uncover viewing trends and customer insights.
	‚Ä¢	Online Retail Analysis: Cleaned and segmented e-commerce transactions, performed funnel analysis (first-time vs returning customers), calculated drop-off rates & retention metrics, and visualized results in Tableau.",1,1756912304.0,analytics,1,1.0,False

1n7hew2,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1n7hew2/does_the_kohree_rv_water_filter_truly_improve/,Does the Kohree RV Water Filter Truly Improve Water Taste and Quality? Review,"Using the Kohree B0892YBMW4 water filter over the past few weeks has been quite an experience. As someone constantly on the road in a motorhome, quality water filtration is non-negotiable. The description boasted of its NSF certification and BPA-free design with a focus on reducing chlorine and improving taste. Naturally, these aspects piqued my interest. Between setting it up and testing its performance, I‚Äôve delved into every little detail to truly figure out its merits and where it might need some improvement.

**Aesthetic and Build Quality**  
One of the first things striking about this water filtration product is its sleek yet durable design. The Kohree B0892YBMW4 feels robust the moment you handle it, thanks to the thicker food-grade plastic shell used in its construction. The durable build isn‚Äôt just design fluff‚Äîit‚Äôs also practical. It endured a full season's wear and tear traveling in my RV without developing any cracks, even after I accidentally dropped it while setting it up. This resilience, coupled with its compact build, means it's easy to store without feeling like it's taking over vital space, which is always appreciated when RV space is at a premium.

**Key Benefits**  
- NSF and BPA-free certification ensure safe filtration for your drinking water.  
- Reliable multi-stage filtration, reducing chlorine content by 97%.  
- Robust food-grade shell that withstands rough use during travel.  
- Easy compatibility with standard water hoses or faucets.  
- High storage capacity of 1,057 gallons per filter with fast flow delivery.  

**Performance On the Road**  
Having tested it during camping trips and while parked at crowded trailer parks, I can vouch for its efficiency. The advertised 20-micron rating with five-layer filtration technology isn‚Äôt just a promotional line. It effectively screens out not just bad odors, but also that occasionally weird metallic aftertaste you encounter in untreated water sources. My morning coffee tasted noticeably cleaner even during extended stays in areas known for poor-quality municipal water. And let‚Äôs talk about the flow rate‚Äîthis inline water filter clocked an impressive 0.5 GPM, ensuring I wasn't frustrated waiting forever to fill my water tanks.  

[Find the best price for Kohree B0892YBMW4 on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0892ybmw4/)

**Ease of Use and Installation**  
Setting up the unit was far from complicated. The instructions were clear and straightforward, sparing me the need for any additional tools or late-night YouTube tutorials. Connecting it to the standard RV water hose took only about five minutes. Its inline design greatly simplifies water flow, offering a hassle-free experience. If you‚Äôre someone often overwhelmed by technical installations, rest assured, this is one user-friendly design.

**Downsides**  
- As durable as it is, the inline design sometimes makes it tricky to maneuver in cramped spaces.  
- The filter‚Äôs lifespan‚Äî3 to 6 months depending on usage‚Äîcould be limiting for full-time RVers consuming high water volumes.  
- You‚Äôll notice the cost of replacement filters adding up over time.  

**Versatility in Application**  
What surprised me was the versatility of this water filter. Though designed with RVs in mind, I used it for several gardening chores and even for filtering drinking water while boating. Its adaptability is a major plus, not just for travelers, but also for day-to-day use around the house or garden. It attaches effortlessly to standard water hoses or faucets, proving useful in multiple scenarios.

**Competitive Options**  
Having used Camco and Culligan RV water filters in the past, it‚Äôs impossible not to compare. While Camco offers affordability, the Kohree unit stood out with its NSF-certified filtration, which I instantly trusted more. Culligan offers superior flow rates in some cases, but the distinct chlorine reduction and bad-taste elimination provided here make this filter a strong rival. Where Kohree edges ahead overall is its combination of robust build and value-driven performance at a competitive price point.

**Affordable Quality**  
Priced fairly in the market, this water filter balances performance with a budget-friendly cost. Compared to some higher-priced filters, this one delivers good quality without an inflated price tag. Granted, the running cost of replacement filters adds up if you're a heavy user, but the improvement in water quality makes it worth considering. Investing in this filter felt like treating myself to something reliable and practical, making it an essential addition to my RV gear.

1. Your thoughts & suggestions

2. What professional/s should I deal with? (accountant / financial planner etc)

  
Situation:

Myself & husband work in public sector, approx. 100k per annum combined salaries. Approx. 150k in savings just sitting in bank accounts. Between myself & my partner we have three mortgage-free properties (inherited), two which we rent. I have two pensions but partner has none.

We have one child and a simple lifestyle, e.g. no fancy car, mainly holiday in Ireland with one trip to Europe per year. Def spend too much on food & coffee but not looking to change that!

  
Financial goals:

1. I would like to move to a larger house (3 bed), we are in a 2 bed ATM. Ideally do this without having to sell another property.

2. Get the savings out of bank accounts! This might be short term while we decide if we will move house, or longer term investment if we decide to stay put.

3. Decide should my partner also get a pension & how best to go about this.

I've been drinking 2-5 cups of coffee, everyday, for the past 20 years, and as I'm trying to improve my sleep (and HRV and other parameters), I read that stopping caffeine could be game changing. 

I've decided to give it a try for the next few weeks, and see if/how it impacts me. 

A few questions though : 

\- is drinking decaf okay?

\- I believe Coke Zero doesn't work?

\- what about Tea?

1. Treat coffee with respect
Coffee is not water. Stop pounding it at 5pm and wondering why you‚Äôre staring at the ceiling at 2am. Be strategic, not chaotic.

2. Mind-map your classes
Before lectures pile up, grab a sheet and map out each course + big topics. Turns your brain into a spider web of connections instead of a random soup of notes. And yes, there‚Äôs science that says it boosts memory.


3. Build buffer time
Stop scheduling life like you‚Äôre a robot. Add 10‚Äì15 min cushions between things. That way, when class runs late or you spiral on a calc problem, you don‚Äôt nuke your whole day.


4. Change your scenery
Your bed is for sleep, not essays. Rotate in a caf√©, library, or even a park bench. New environment = new focus, and you‚Äôll dodge the ‚Äúoh look my fridge again‚Äù problem.


5. Track your time like a nerdy wizard ü™Ñ
Don‚Äôt just hope you‚Äôre studying enough track it. I started using Studentheon (it‚Äôs free) and it legit changed the game. You hit start on a Pomodoro timer, and it spits out stats/graphs of how much you actually worked. Wildly motivating to see ‚Äúwow, I actually studied 30 hours this week‚Äù instead of just vibes.

He whispers (in a voice at the top of his lungs, so that all people within a 50 foot radius can hear): ""Who. Took. The last. Cup?"" It was giving courtroom drama.

Another coworker pipes up from her desk: ""Wasn't me. I only had half a cup."" Which, if I'm being honest, sounded hella guilty. Next thing I know, this man is interrogating the entire office like we're criminals at a crime scene. ""We're adults! We're supposed to refill the pot!""

There are five of us in the hallway now, staring like we're watching prime-time TV. Someone even pulled over a chair. Then our manager strolls in, cool as can be, pours the remaining little dribble left in the pot into his cup, and says: ""This is why I bring my own Keurig."" The betrayal in the room was palpable.

The coffee deprived coworker throws his arms up and screams: ""THIS OFFICE HAS NO HONOR!"" and storms out. He comes back ten minutes later holding a Starbucks cup the size of his head like a victorious conqueror.

The clincher? He left a message on the coffee pot that now reads: ""You kill it, you fill it. Don't test me."" Seriously, better than over half of the programming on Netflix¬†right¬†now.",6,1756911592.0,story,1,1.0,False

And it wasnt as expected. Too many things he did very wrong way and i put up with it just because I love him too much and invested way too much time and effort into making this relationship work. My friend told to me to make a pros and cons list. And after i made the list I'm feeling depressed.  How much forgiving does it take to make a relationship work? Are these mistakes evn worthy of forgiveness? Here are some of the cons-
1.	Denied to come to graduation 
2.	 Told me to not wear skirt to first meet, I told I'm doing it because next day periods start so insisted to meet the previous day probably with ulterior motive because he came at 8 pm.
3.	When I tired to look at mobile tried to hide chats with GirlA but when I forcefully checked it found out he  was sending inappropriate reels (weird yoga positions, spit or swallow) to GirlA and she sent him reels with similar vibes.
4.	Always deleted chats with GirlA before meeting me.
5.	When we were together, and went to music museum, GirlA sent her pic saying she was hanging out with friends, he sent our pic and wrote ""MISSING YOU""
6.	Always manipulated me at beginning months to come over to his place, it was never clean or tidy. Then showed me hell by ""sneaking"" me in, he was always stressed of anyone would catch a glimpse of me so was stressed and was removing all the anger of me. The act of just SNEAKING IN AND OUT was so damn stressful all this time for me. Just thinking about it rn is stressing me out so much.
7.	Initial 3-4 months, we ate mostly one meal per day, I was hungry but too shy to say anything about it, he followed this schedule of eating 1 and rarely 2 meals per Day out of which one is probably a snack, whereas I always followed a routine of eating 3 meals but in small portion, I was starving most of the times 
8.	He went out to drink tea once or twice a day, but never once asked me if I wanted to drink it. I have tea twice a day at home since I was like 10 y/o. It never even occurred to him to offer, he Made me stand at the window and watch him, even then the thought didn't cross him
9.	 He went out with his friends when he was the one who called me there in the first place, 3-4 hours at a time, when I was upset about it, he tried to justify it by saying I have spent so and so hours with you now I deserve to spend so much amount of time with my friends. Those hours, where I was alone in a room, of a guy I happen to meet online, locked from outside, has to be one of the lowest points in my life. I was given instructions, no sound should reach outside, since his roommate might have heard. So there I was , lying in his room, alone, without making a single noise, I cleaned his room in this time , hoping he would be happy if he comes back to clean room
10.	Now to the lowest most hurtful moment of my life. We had breakfast at 11 am, probably made love and he slept for hours together after that, I can't fall asleep so was up , I was hungry but couldn't do much about it, he woke up at evening, around 6 told he is going out with friends. Half bottle of water, I didn't think much about it because I thought he would be back soon. Then the trauma started. I was hungry, with Nothing to eat, nothing to drink, just sitting there like a prisoner, I could've ordered something to eat, but the room was locked from outside. He came back at 11:30 , with a smile on his face he says I went to check out a room with friends, then we went to eat, after that we went to polar bear to get ice cream, it was delicious, I thought of getting you something to eat but my friends would get suspicious if I bring something back so I did not get you anything, he says with a bright smile. I knew that moment that this man does not give two fucks about me, but still I stayed.
11.	My birthday, did not do anything at all, Nothing. Gave me a wallet, not even gift wrapped, and a small bag , which was for himself but accidentally got pink so was hand me down, I asked him it is my birthday can we finally watch something if my liking, agreed with no interest, watched 3, 20 Mins episode and gave up. After clock hit 12 he said it is past 12 so your privileges (which I had none to begin with) has stopped.
12.	That one time, he wanted to to this place near my pg where he had made me drink beer for the first time,  it was an offer or something if you booked on dineout you get free beers or something like that,  I never liked alcohol, he was excited so gave him company, it was shit, I was feeling very light headed after that, 2-3 mins walk from that place was the bus stop, at this point my vision is bit blurry and head is swinging, we get out of the restaurant , walking towards the busstand, from a distance he sees his bus, he leaves me at that place and bolts towards his bus and leaves. I'm there, late at night, all alone, trying to book auto to go back to pg.  ( At that point I thought he was right because it was late and he got a direct bus so it's a good thing, but later I realized what kind of man, would leave a girl alone at night when she's feeling lightheaded, and prioritize himself and just leave? If he had financial issues so he can't book a cab I can understand but this man is literally earning so much and still he choses to leave me alone and go) I got an auto, went to pg and just laid on bed.
13.	Met after a while, I didn't want to have any kind of fight, so I went dressed in traditional clothes so that he will like me enough to not get mad at me on any topic, it was RCB match on that day, we went to a mall. And all the precautionary measures I took goes to vain. His anger issues are at peak. Turns out he was supposed to book train tickets for his family members to go to village for some marriage, he procrastinate through the whole thing and didn't manage to do it, and family were supposed to leave on that day, when he's stressed about someone ik Hells gonna break loose for me, throughout the day he was just getting mad at every little thing, I tired to make his happy, I was carrying my fan around for him like a bodyguard, everyone was staring at me, I saw this group of people making fun of me cause I was holding up the fam for him feeding him coffee, I didn't mind, I wanted to try my best to make him feel better,  but he was still staring at his mobile, RCB match was airing at the mall and it was an important match because that was the point in which rcb had to win all the matches to qualify for Playoffs, my mobile had less charge so I asked him if he's busy in train ticket fiasco thing (It had been 3-4 hours since we met and he is still stuck in his mobile trying to resolve it) can I go watch the match on the below floor, he strictly denied and sit there and made me watch his struggle through the whole thing, and the ironic part is that, after using up all the time we were together on ""trying"" to book train tickets , they ended up going in a bus to the village.
14.	H&M Fiasco: Fuck now that I'm thinking about this, it is so depressing, if I had a chance I wish I had ended my life at 15, I didn't want to suffer this way. Okay back to the story. We are at H&M , he never listens to my choices or opinions but for once I wanted him to try out the clothes of my choice, I don't even want him to buy, just to try it out, he's waiting in the trial room line and I bring out few pieces for him to try on, he says doesn't want to, I request him, he says no, I request him again, he takes offence and anger issues boils up and he yells at me with a loud voice infront of everyone. Everyone is staring at me , idk how to react in this kind of situation because I've never been yelled at throughout my life. Mind you, this was the day that i thought since I'm visiting his place frequently, rather than carrying the luggage everytime I thought I will keep some at his place so I had bought some luggage and since it was too heavy I had put some in his bag. After him yelling in a public place at me I'm very upset I'm crying in the H&M , he didn't apologise or anything, we head out to metro station, we are sitting and removes all my clothes from his bag and throws it out on my bag IN A FREAKING METRO STATION publicly humiliating me, i start to cry abd take those clothes and shove it down in my bag. At this point I should've had some self respect and headed back to my PG but my dumbass got manipulated again and headed to his place after all this.
15.	I saved up all my money to be with him on his birthday. Dad didn't allow me to go to his city, so had a huge fight with dad for the first time. Dad went to sleep alone upstairs for the first time, so much crying and yelling happened in home. After all this, I reach to his place, I decorate his room, order cake and arrange everything. I tell him that I'm about to take a quick shower before cutting the cake. He throws the cake. HE THREW THE FUCKING CAKE. Along with the food. Threw everything. Not an ounce on regret on his face. I had to pick all the stuff up off the ground 




TLDR: I'm not sure if the man I'm dating is really worth the stress that I'm getting so made a trauma cons list. I just applied for two days leave combined with 2 days of week off just to meet him but after making this list I'm reconsidering it

But I also don't want to buy a tea that's too good for a travel brew, or that's too pricey for me to enjoy drinking it while attending classes

So, I'm looking for a tea with a good amount of caffeine and/or that packs a punch to stay awake during the day, that's cheaper than 0,5‚Ç¨ per session (5g per session, so aprox. 10‚Ç¨ per 100g of tea), and preferably loose leaf so I can pack it up quickly in the morning. The quality of the new comes second here, I prefer to drink a more dull tea if it means having a good energy boost in the process. Also worth noting, I have a hot water fountain next to my class, so water temperature isn't an issue

I've found some incredibly cheap options like this bud heavy black tea from KTM (https://kingteamall.com/en-es/products/2025-black-tea-song-zhen-tou-chun-te-ji-pine-like-needle-early-spring-special-a-grade-loose-leaf-tea-dian-hong-fengqing-yunnan?variant=45806162608358), as well as this tippy green from YS (https://yunnansourcing.com/collections/best-selling-products/products/first-flush-mao-feng-yunnan-green-tea?variant=44951216914631), but I'm concerned I'm missing out on some other stronger and more caffeine-heavy options

So, I'm asking you: Do you have any recommendations for this specific array of requests?

1n7gzsz,https://v.redd.it/9x8694a8rymf1,Broken Shower [Sage Barista Express],"Hello everyone,

Our working group uses a Sage Barista Express as our daily coffee source. I am still fairly new to the rabbit hole of espresso and coffee overall. 
As you can see in the included video, the shower does not distribute the water evenly, but rather in this reproducible pattern. From what I have heard, the upper shower screen (? Please forgive me if this isn't the correct term) often breaks in these machines since it is made from cheap plastics. 

Do you think that it should definitely be replaced and if so, what are good replacements for the money. Please remember that this is a shared setup.

I decided to give it one final shot before uninstalling the app. We hit it off, and eventually I got her number. We had a couple of video calls and decided to meet up at a local caf√© for a first date.

I got there a little early, grabbed a coffee and a bagel, and when she walked in I stood up to greet her. I went in for a hug, and she loudly said ‚ÄúNO.‚Äù I was definitely caught off guard, but I tried to play it cool by cracking a joke, which made her laugh and eased the tension a bit.

The rest of the date wasn‚Äôt great though. She talked a lot, mostly about herself, and whenever I tried to add to the conversation or comment on something, she‚Äôd interrupt. I felt like I was just there to nod and listen. By the end of it, I‚Äôd already made up my mind that I didn‚Äôt want to see her again.

Later, I told a female friend everything about the date and said I was disappointed. She seemed a bit upset and asked, ‚ÄúMaybe she had a bad day, are you sure you don‚Äôt want to give her another chance?‚Äù

So, Reddit, did I overreact by deciding not to go on a second date?",1,1756911154.0,AmIOverreacting,5,1.0,False

Are you aware of how perfect you are?  
Inside and out you radiate perfection

Tracing your sweet smile    
Missing your everyday charms

Your presence is supernatural healer  
I can't breathe without you here

Images of you baking bread

I do anything to make it seem like you're here 
I listen to your songs    
I watch your movies  
I hold the leftover clothes you have here

1. a pepsi that was the color of pond water, with a berry flavor. i dont recall the name, nor did i try it - i just remember it said ""Berry"" on the bottle.

2. Pepsi Galaxy Suspension. i didnt get to try this one either, but it appeared to be a regular pepsi with a layer of what i have to assume was thickened milk(? uncertain) floating on top, which you had to incorporate by shaking the bottle. i really wish i had tried this one. the ""galaxy"" in the name reminds me of Coca-Cola Starlight (which i miss dearly), so i like to imagine it was similar to starlight, but maybe with a little vanilla cream swirl action from whatever the hell the white liquid on top was.

man im gonna be thinking about Pepsi Galaxy Suspension all day. could maybe create something approaching PGS by adding some vanilla coffee creamer to pepsi. further research and experimentation required",8,1756911025.0,somnigastronomy,2,0.91,False

Wrappers Delight

The Essence Series breaks new ground for Casa Carrillo. It explores what makes each wrapper type different and what gives them soul beyond the surface. Six blends will be introduced over the next few years. Each cigar has a different wrapper leaf. Each cigar intended to ‚Äúawaken your senses.‚Äù It is innovative in an industry obsessed with strength, complexity, and lineage. Here, the wrapper takes center stage.

So, Essence Maduro isn't just another dark cigar from EP Carrillo. It's built different.

https://preview.redd.it/vrk8zukbqymf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5dc92bae19fb5c0677528e5d7c0d0c66e149e513

With his Mexican San Andr√©s-wrapped offering, Ernesto isn't chasing maximum strength. He's not trying to craft the next hard-hitting Maduro either. Instead, he's after something more subtle.

The Mexican San Andr√©s wrapper underwent what Carrillo calls ""ultra-fermentation,"" giving it a distinctively toothy texture and dark, oily appearance. You can feel it when rolling the cigar between your fingers. But rather than pairing it with powerhouse fillers that compete for attention, Ernesto opts for restraint.

Worth noting is the Honduran binder. It‚Äôs tobacco that Carrillo doesn't often include in his blends. Here, however, it acts as a bridge between the Mexican San Andr√©s wrapper and the Nicaraguan fillers. It's a balancing act that speaks to his evolution.

High: Complexity that unfolds gradually. The flavor transitions happen purposefully. There are no jarring shifts, but smooth progressions that keep you wanting more. There's genuine depth here. Notes of dark chocolate, black pepper, and espresso emerge early, giving way to subtle leather, earth, and a hint of raisin. The ultra-fermented wrapper delivers exactly what Carrillo intended: richness without overwhelming.

Low: This particular size‚Äîthe 6"" x 60 Gordo‚Äîwill automatically turn off some enthusiasts due to its girth. Old-school purists might dismiss it before giving it a fair chance. The draw requires patience in the first inch as the cigar opens up. And let's be honest: an hour and a half commitment isn't always practical. This is a problem with a simple solution: try the other vitolas in the line.

Whoa: The overall value proposition. Carrillo managed to create a premium Maduro experience without the premium price point that usually comes with ultra-fermented wrappers. You're getting luxury-level complexity that rivals cigars arriving with much more hype. The real surprise? How restrained it feels. Subtle. This is what happens when a master blender prioritizes balance over brute force.

The Last Word

EP Carrillo has created a cigar that stands out in a crowded maduro market.

This is a cigar that gets better with familiarity. It's the kind of smoke that makes you slow down and pay attention and then rewards you for doing so.",1,1756911001.0,cigar,0,1.0,False

I hope this ad reaches the right people so here it goes. 

I‚Äôd love to find strength, humor, and resilience, but also a soft side that values kindness and connection. I‚Äôm independent, but I still believe that sharing laughter, adventures, and quiet moments with the right person is one of life‚Äôs best gifts.

A little about me; I‚Äôm plus size, Latina, warm and have 2 cats. I love to cook and bake. I‚Äôm the lady who makes her own syrups for coffees and loves pumpkin spice deeply, however where I live I can‚Äôt find it sadly so it remains in memory only (I lived in the states for a couple of years and I got spoiled). I‚Äôm bilingual (English/Spanish), which means I can whisper sweet things in two languages. I am socially awkward and struggle to connect with people usually but one on one specially online is fine, I‚Äôll probably chat a lot too. I love horror movies, coffee, anything artsy, discovering new music and sunsets. 420 friendly. 

What I value in a man: intelligence with kindness, humor without cruelty, ambition without arrogance. Someone who knows what he wants, treats people with respect, and is looking for a connection not just a distraction. Someone who‚Äôs passionate about what he likes, with hobbies and things he enjoys. Someone who knows himself and is able to regulate when he‚Äôs stressed and overwhelmed, as well as able to communicate how he feels. 

If you‚Äôre someone who enjoys deep talks, shares a good laugh, horror, and believes in building something meaningful, I‚Äôd love to hear from you. Please be close to my age and on a similar time zone, im on CST.

I couldn‚Äôt explain to you why, I don‚Äôt necessarily believe in at least half of them. There‚Äôs no way a plesiosaur could survive at the bottom of Loch Ness for hundreds of millions of years only for it to be casually spotted by a photographer one time at the turn of the century and that‚Äôs to say nothing of my suspicions of a certain bipedal ape-man supposedly stopping around my own neck of the woods. But I have spent a concerning amount of time and bandwidth clicking through article after article on Wikipedia. I have scraped the very bottoms of rabbit holes in years-old forum posts, Youtube videos, and even Ebaumsworld. 

I watched that movie with the guy who shoved a gerbil up his ass that was supposed to be about Mothman. Get this: they never show you the fucking Mothman! I mean, okay, side rant: I am a firm believer that you should put the monster in the movie if your movie is about a monster. However, I digress. The point is, I‚Äôm fully invested. I don‚Äôt exactly advertise it at school, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd stick out even worse in a small town if I was to walk around with an X-Files tee and be the only autistic kid that anyone knew of. I‚Äôve been the subject of ridicule plenty of times, though it‚Äôs hard for me to tell when they‚Äôre sincerely talking to me or just messing with me. It‚Äôs like they all have some inside joke with each other that I‚Äôm not in on, but whatever.

It was late last summer before school started back up that I was on /x/ reading creepypasta that I found a reposted trove of links to all things paranormal and kinda spooky. The usual BS was there, including that video of a supposed manticore somewhere in Iraq and a whole bunch of dead links to things that have since been reuploaded. But there was one among them that I hadn‚Äôt seen before. While my broadband took a minute to buffer the video, the title read something like ‚ÄúThe House That Moves‚Äù or something. It didn‚Äôt have a ton of views at that point, maybe only a few hundred. I think it said it was uploaded two days before, the stars averaged about three and a half.

The footage looked to be from a standard digital camcorder, nothing too high end but definitely not a dogshit cellphone video. It was a man in a trapper cap and a buttoned up flannel standing somewhere out in the woods, looking like he literally just shat his pants before hitting record.

*‚ÄúUhh‚Ä¶ Hello, my name is‚Ä¶ strix211. I‚Äôm out here today‚Ä¶ in‚Ä¶‚Äù* He says, looking around as though keeping watch for someone. *‚ÄúBeautiful Castenada, Oregon‚Ä¶‚Äù*

I felt my soul plummet out of my body mid-sip of a Mountain Dew Game Fuel. This happened here? Did I know this guy?

*‚ÄúI‚Äôve been scoping this place‚Ä¶ for a few weeks or so now. I think it was built back in the 20‚Äôs‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not too sure about the exact date‚Ä¶ Might want to fact check me on that. It‚Äôs been here a long time, I remember seeing it all the time as a boy. But it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ moving around. Deeper in the woods. No more driveway, no yard‚Ä¶ just an old house.‚Äù*

The footage cut to a zooming shot of a house not just surrounded by trees, but practically being swallowed by the forest. Branches threatened to break in through the age-warped windows and ferns jutted out from the steps leading up onto the porch. That‚Äôs when I saw the red door through the thick of the trees as it slowly opened ever so slightly. The documentarian whispered an exasperated *‚ÄúFuck!‚Äù* as it hard cut to another scene some time later. The house was still surrounded by trees but‚Ä¶ It looked like maybe it was on an incline? It‚Äôs hard to explain, but it definitely looked like the same house but in a different spot.

Could easily be a different house, as some comments suggested down below. CGI even crossed my mind, though I think it would be hard to fake something like that on footage like this, but then I‚Äôm not exactly an editor. I just watch DVD commentary and sometimes pay attention in Intro to Broadcasting. But the thing that still held my attention was the fact this guy was from here. Why would some redneck fake a video of a house moving around the woods? Who the hell is he anyway? He looked to be about my dad‚Äôs age, maybe late-30s. He didn‚Äôt look familiar to me at all, though I don‚Äôt exactly get out much. I decided to shoot him a private message, kinda just asking about the video and mentioning I was a local. I didn‚Äôt really think about it much after that, it was getting close to another school year and yet another opportunity for me to get tripped in the hallway by kids who skip class to smoke weed behind the gym.

It took a few weeks for me to get a reply, but there it was:

*Thanks for watching, friend! I‚Äôm glad a local has finally taken an interest in The House and I strongly encourage you to do your own research on the place. I‚Äôm just some guy, not really a geologist or anything like that. But this could be potentially big. Would you care to meet at the Coronado ‚Äò51 say Saturday at 11 am? I‚Äôd like to show you my findings if you‚Äôre available.*

I wasn‚Äôt sure what to reply to this. Was I really going to meet up with some strange man I met on a Youtube video linked to a thread on fucking 4chan? Where‚Äôs NBC Dateline when you need them? All the same, it was a public place and surely Bonney would be around. Never hurts to have a witness around, I guess.

So yeah, I went to the diner. I told my mom I was heading to The Black Warp, the only record/video store in town where I would spend a lot of time if I wasn‚Äôt at Blockbuster or getting my ass kicked by hicks in Carhartts. Adam, the guy who owned the spot, didn‚Äôt seem to mind me all that much and I didn‚Äôt really mind him despite everyone else in town kinda pretending he doesn‚Äôt even exist for some weird reason. Anyway, tangent. Diner.

The Coranado was usually full on a Saturday morning for the breakfast rush and today was no exception. However, 10 was usually when people started to leave just before the lunch crowd could set in and I had shown up somewhere between the two. I don‚Äôt do well with crowded areas as the noises tend to overstimulate me and I start to get anxious. I knew I had a limited window to get in and get out of this meeting before things would start to ramp up. I chained my bike up, took off my headphones, and walked into the diner.

Sure as shit, strix211 was sitting at the counter sipping a mug of black coffee while rummaging through a notebook full of loose sketches and equations. I took a second to really question whether or not this was a good idea. Yes, Bonney was at the till as always and even greeted me as I walked in. Yes, there was other people around. No, he didn‚Äôt look armed or dangerous. But for context, I‚Äôm a scrawny 17 year old kid. I don‚Äôt have a driver‚Äôs license (just a learner‚Äôs permit), so I biked here and worked up an embarrassing amount of sweat trying to get down here. I don‚Äôt lift weights, my face is covered in acne, and I suck at eye contact. This man could destroy me if he felt so inclined. He looked as though he worked in a very physical line of work, like construction or maybe even forestry.

The real kicker for me though was that he was wearing the same crusty green trapper cap from his video like he was Kyle Broflovski if he grew up to be a creepy lumberjack. Something about it gave off a feeling of pathetic friendliness, though I‚Äôd be hard pressed to explain that unnamable feeling. Without further ado, I took my seat beside strix211 who looked up from his notes with his piercing hazel eyes like a lone fox foraging in winter.

‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm A‚Ä¶ eh, chapstick_00.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt sure if there was anything this guy could do with just my first name, but then who knows? He seemed somewhat dumbfounded as though I came up to him unprompted and told him his parents were just sold to the Taliban for beer money.

‚ÄúWho‚Ä¶ w-what?‚Äù He looked around the diner. I couldn‚Äôt tell whether he too had maybe seen To Catch A Predator and was waiting for the other shoe to drop or if maybe that was something he just did regardless of the situation.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that you got there? Notes?‚Äù I asked, trying to cut past awkward silence. I was able to better see the collection of topographical maps with notes in yellow highlighter and red pen scrawled on them. The paper looked worn and tattered from years of elemental abuse. He glanced down at his notes and cleared his throat before speaking again.

‚ÄúYou could say that. I‚Äôve been doing a lot of surveying of the woods on the far edge of town‚Ä¶ Work stuff. I didn‚Äôt go looking for the house, but I found it out there. I remember seeing it when I was a boy, it used to be here on the corner of 40th and Sycamore‚Ä¶‚Äù He indicated on his map with his finger.

‚ÄúOne day though‚Ä¶ I think when I was twelve‚Ä¶ it was torn down. At least I thought it was. Most people kind of assumed it was back then. But then I started reading more about the town‚Äôs history‚Ä¶ That place was a historic landmark, or could‚Äôve at least been considered one. It was built some time in the 1920‚Äôs after much of the town was burned in a forest fire. A lot of those houses were eventually demolished and rebuilt in the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs with a few remaining here and there‚Ä¶ All of which were recognized as monuments by the Castenada Historical Society. All except the house on 40th and Sycamore‚Ä¶‚Äù

He looked over his shoulder again as someone opened the door to leave the diner. ‚ÄúThe house always looked weird to me‚Ä¶ I remember one day when I was a kid that it looked like it had moved ever so slightly as if someone lifted the whole thing over night and nudged it a couple of inches‚Ä¶ My mom said, ‚ÄòOh, it‚Äôs an old house, probably settling into the soil.‚Äô But that didn‚Äôt make any sense. She mostly likely said that so she didn‚Äôt have to actually answer her son with an answer that required any time or intention of reason behind it. But it moved, it definitely moved. It was the same summer I first heard Creedance Clearwater Revival. They had been a band for quite some time‚Ä¶ They might‚Äôve broken up by then, I don‚Äôt remember‚Ä¶ But that was the first time I ever heard them on the radio and all this is as clear to me now as it was then.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt really sure at this point if I should stick around and continue listening to this guy. Operative word being *‚Äòshould.‚Äô* Wanted to? Abso-fucking-lutely. So I took up a seat beside strix211 at the counter. Bonney came over with a pot of piping-hot black coffee and poured me a cup without even asking if I wanted one. She, however, eyed strix211 for a long moment as she did and then looked over at me, but opted to not comment on it.

‚ÄúGood morning, Adrien,‚Äù she said before tending to other customers. Well, shit. Now he knows my name.

I brushed past it, ‚ÄúSo the house started to move when you were a kid? Did you ever physically see it move or was it something where you would walk over there and see that the house had moved while you were asleep?‚Äù

‚ÄúI never saw it physically move much. It knows when it‚Äôs being watched‚Ä¶‚Äù he looked over at Bonney for a moment before taking another prolonged sip of his coffee.

‚ÄúDid you ever record the house while it was unattended? Did anyone live in it?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been able to get footage of the house while I wasn‚Äôt there‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt own a tripod and I don‚Äôt want anyone to steal my camera. Do you have any idea how expensive a camera is? That‚Äôs a Sony HDR-FX7 HDV camcorder‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a $3500 camera. Do you want me to just‚Ä¶ leave it in the woods? Are you insane?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, no. Good point.‚Äù I grabbed a french vanilla creamer and emptied it into the coffee mug. *Was there a reason he didn‚Äôt answer whether or not people lived in the house?* I decided not to press the issue just yet. ‚ÄúThat sounds like a nice camera. What made you want to get that kind?‚Äù

He looked at me, but I couldn‚Äôt tell what emotion he was expressing. Maybe annoyed? Grumpy? ‚ÄúI purchased that camera from a reputable store while I was in Portland to watch a dog race‚Ä¶ Completely unrelated to the house. I am also an avid‚Ä¶ bird watcher‚Ä¶ Look, can we get back to the house?‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry, I didn‚Äôt mean to annoy you, I was just interested.‚Äù I took a sip of coffee. As I did, a family of five walked through the front door. Two of the kids were giggling as they played some game. I was starting to smell the maple syrup clear as the burgers began to hit the grill. Time was wearing thin.

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ No, I‚Äôm not annoyed. It‚Äôs just a‚Ä¶ weird question to ask a stranger. I just want to talk about the house,‚Äù he said, looking down at his notes like a kid looking at a sled on a snowy day. ‚ÄúIt was when I was 23 that I first noticed the house on 40th and Sycamore had been torn down. No debris, no wood, nothing. Just an empty lot with grass and a few trees as though nothing had ever been there. My mother said it was kinda odd how they tore down and how efficiently they did when they couldn‚Äôt even get around to fixing the potholes on Pine Street. She was more preoccupied with talking about holes in asphalt than the disappearance of an entire house. I had raised my concerns to others, but they dismissed me. I was given no other choice but to do my own research‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt make any sense, why would anyone demolish a house overnight?‚Äù I asked more in agreement than with any expectation of an answer. Someone at one of the booths was talking kinda loudly about something and I had to pretend that it didn‚Äôt bother me.

‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶ Exactly!‚Äù strix211 looked up from his notes finally and smiled at me. ‚ÄúI had even tried submitting a police report, but the less said of Sheriff Buckley the better.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt too familiar with the local police department outside of the handful of times police officers would come to the elementary school for assemblies, but Sheriff Buckley‚Äôs name was one I had heard mentioned quite a bit in hushed tones tucked within conversations I was excluded from. The door opened, a middle-aged trucker and a woman young enough to be his daughter walked in. He began making loud small talk with Bonney to only his amusement.

He continued, ‚ÄúI had spent a few months studying different phenomena and local history to understand what had happened. I had questioned the neighbors on a number of occasions, but they all claimed to be sleeping when the house disappeared and none of them had any interest in discussing the subject‚Ä¶ Like someone had gotten to them before me. I was forced to abandon the case momentarily as I had no promising leads to follow up on. I was ready to forget the whole thing‚Ä¶ Go back to working late nights and reading my novels‚Ä¶ But the house revealed itself to me. I had the exterior walls of it burned into my memory, every spot where the paint had chipped away. The strange art-deco columns, the warped glass of the windows, the somewhat gothic arches of the roof gable and dormers. I saw it there off to the side of Route 2 under the light of the full moon, its roof like the wings of a great dragon‚Ä¶ It came out of hiding at last to show me that it was still out there!‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you ever been inside?‚Äù I asked.

He frowned somewhat. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ Not yet.‚Äù

I remembered the split second of footage where the front door was swinging open. ‚ÄúDo you know who was in the house in the video?‚Äù

He looked at me, his brows furrowed. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

I shifted in my seat, sort of staring off into a corner of the diner where one of the lights had gone out in an attempt to avoid his gaze. ‚ÄúIn the Youtube video. You‚Äôre zooming in on the front door, it starts to open, and you even react to it happening.‚Äù

He continues to look at me. ‚ÄúI feel like‚Ä¶ I would remember that happening.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean to tell me you edited the video and didn‚Äôt notice at any point that happened?‚Äù I asked, beginning to wonder if maybe I dreamt it or something.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt remember anything like that happening.‚Äù He finally breaks his gaze to sip his coffee, forgetting he emptied his mug already. The trucker had a very loud laugh. The family of five‚Äôs teenage daughter, someone I didn‚Äôt recognize, started to argue with her mother. Two more people walked in. I could feel my palms starting to clam up as it became harder for me to focus on the conversation at hand. I knew I had to plan my exit, but at this point I was hooked in. A house that moves? This guy? This is the sort of thing I only ever read about and see Mulder and Scully doing on TV. I grab a pen from my pocket and a napkin to write down my email address.

‚ÄúHey, I gotta get going. You can email me here. I also have MSN. Do you use IM?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNot really‚Ä¶ I can maybe download it,‚Äù he said, grabbing a napkin of his own and gesturing to borrow my pen. I handed it to him along with my email address. He wrote down his phone number, email address, and then drew a strange symbol I had never seen before yet looked so familiar. Underneath it he wrote ‚ÄúSteven.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was nice meeting you, Steven. I hope to hear from you soon.‚Äù I said as I got up.

‚ÄúOf course. I‚Äôm glad‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm glad that someone is finally taking an interest.‚Äù he said with a smirk. He gestured to shake my hand. I fumbled and gave him probably the dampest, limpest handshake of my life. I waved goodbye to Bonney who made eye contact with me as I was leaving and made her way over to the front door.

‚ÄúAdrien, wait!‚Äù she called as she followed me out into the parking lot. I slowed down as my pulse started to even a bit and I was breathing fresh air.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù I asked as I reached for the key to my bike lock.

‚ÄúAdrien, do you know that man at the counter?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúUh, kinda. We talked online for a bit.‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI see,‚Äù she replied, her brow lowered somewhat which she did when she was worried. I understood how it looked and was prepared to be forward about everything, but she caught me off guard. ‚ÄúAdrien, you should probably know that Steven is a confused man. He‚Äôs a very smart and interesting person, but he‚Äôs also very‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not really sure how to phrase this. I guess you could say that he‚Äôs a little, I dunno, odd.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I guess I know a thing or two about that.‚Äù I said flatly. ‚ÄúIs he like dangerous or something?‚Äù

She stammered somewhat, ‚ÄúWell, n-not exactly. I don‚Äôt think so, anyway. He just‚Ä¶ He means well, but he also sees things that aren‚Äôt there. He‚Äôs not well.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ Is there a problem with me talking to him, Bonney? I don‚Äôt understand what your intention is here.‚Äù I said, growing somewhat frustrated.

‚ÄúNo, Adrien,‚Äù she said with a sigh. ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm talking out of turn here. I‚Äôm just concerned, is all. I‚Äôve known Steven awhile now and I want what‚Äôs best for him and for you, for that matter. I don‚Äôt want either of you getting hurt.‚Äù

‚ÄúWith all due respect, I‚Äôm not a fragile little kid,‚Äù I said a little louder. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not someone that needs to be babied, I know how to look out for myself! I don‚Äôt need this!‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù she urged in a quieter tone, trying not to arouse any suspicion from passing customers who were in turn pretending not to notice. ‚ÄúI clearly put my foot in my mouth and I‚Äôm just gonna see my way out of this one. Just know that you can talk to me if you need anything, okay?‚Äù

I started to ease up a little bit, my head still rushing as I started to become more aware of my surroundings and where I was in the present moment. I wanted to apologize, to put the mask back on and hide among everyone else, but too many eyes were on me now. I grabbed my bike and I left without another word.

This pick comes down to two things for me, friends. Both squads are incredibly capable offensively, and to be frank, I just don‚Äôt trust Aaron Nola (6.47 ERA) not to melt out there. Nola‚Äôs last 4 straight outings have seen the Over cash in spades, while Brewers starter Jose Quintana (3.69 ERA) let the Diamondbacks bag 6 runs off him in his last start at home.

The hose in the pic just pop off by itself as I open up the cover. Common sense tells me it should be seal tight against that black little circle thing on the board. Looks like at some point towards the end of its life there was a coffee leak where the pressure sensor and the hose connect.

The concept is a shop that sells vintage/analog technology of high quality (refurbished or like new turntables, typewriters, film cameras, solid state televisions, etc) plus a variety of new, non-digital goods and tools (stationary, notebooks, journals, games, puzzles, etc). The shop would be marketed as a ‚Äúlow tech hangout‚Äù that also sells beer and coffee. In my mind, the shop would host events almost every night (trivia, open mic, board game night, basic art and craft classes, etc.) The market for analog tech is growing, believe it or not.

There are no other shops quite like this and only a few bars overall, all with a very different vibe that I‚Äôm imagining. From the research I‚Äôve done, I would be able to secure a substantial amount of vintage stock for okay prices, and the new goods are very cheap wholesale. I imagine the beverages would end up being a majority of my sales, though.

That being said, I think bars, cafes, and antique stores probably have some of the worst margins of any business venture. My hope is the shop would become a destination and community hub with a unique charm that brings people back and keeps sales high. I could run it with very low overhead, at least in the beginning, by not having staff. 

Be honest, is this a stupid idea?",1,1756910593.0,smallbusiness,4,1.0,False

1n7goef,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/1n7goef/entitled_mother_called_me_predator_and_threw_hot/,Entitled Mother called me predator and threw hot coffee at me for playing Roblox . . .,"So this happened a week back and I'm still boiling over that people can be this annoying. First of all, I'm a 21 y/o guy. I had a big chunk of free time in my schedule (also I had senioritis started kicking in). It was hot so I decided to get some sweet iced coffee and sat down at a booth and started to play some Roblox. Judge all you want, but I started playing Roblox since 2016, and have liked the game ever since, (wish I could say I like what the company is doing now smh).   
  
Anyways I was playing this addicting game called My Hello Kitty Cafe, it's basically a restaurant tycoon game and I got into it by some friends way back. Anyways, I noticed a little girl and her EM waiting in line, she was ordering a cake pop, she was peeking at my computer every now and then and she walked over. This is the convo. \[Girl = G, EM = Entitled Mother\]

G: Hi, what game is that?

Me (being friendly): Oh this, it's a game on Roblox, where you build a restaurant, hire staff, decorate, and earn cash.

G: Can i try?

I let her try, and then watched as we did an order together. EM walked to us with her coffee and cake pop. Conversation:

EM: what are you doing?

Me: Im showing her a game on Roblox

EM: You can't play that game

Me: why not?

EM: Roblox is a kid's game, why are u playing a kid's game

Me: (dumbfounded) because I grew up with this game as a teen?

EM: Well, don't you see what's happening on the news? I wouldn't be surprised if you're predator playing a kid's game meant only for kids. You have other games that you can play, but you only chose to play roblox, seem really weird doesn't (she has a passive agressive smile on her face).

Me: You're crazy and insane for thinking like that. G, Can I have my laptop back.

EM: Don't talk to my daughter you freak!

EM threw her hot coffee on my shirt, and then ran out of the coffee shop with her daughter. The head barista came up to me with napkins asking if I was alright and if I needed to call the cops, I told her it's fine and she said that EM is banned from the coffee shop. 

All I'm gonna say is that some mothers are soooooo infuriating.

i‚Äôve been bouncing around service jobs since i was 16, i‚Äôve done food, retail, customer service, and my latest venture was nannying. 

i think i want to go to school to get a degree in nutrition and hopefully become a RDN. i picked that because my bf works in sports and that way id be able to work alongside him and have a job wherever we go (this was his idea lol). his work requires us to move at the drop of a hat every few years or so, we were at the last place for 6 months so it‚Äôs kinda unpredictable. hard to commit to school and get a long term job to beef up my resume. 

i would do nannying again, only problem is that my last family made me extremely anxious and burnt me out after 4 months. it was really bad, the father was genuinely abusive to them and it triggered me so bad, as cringe as that sounds, i‚Äôm being so fr. i was terrified. nannying is also severely underpaid, i was ft making $15/hr, no benefits. i could barely afford my bills even tho my bf was paying the big bills. we live at the bare minimum level. no avocado toast, no coffee at cafes, no new clothes in years. my clothes don‚Äôt fit and have holes. it‚Äôs embarrassing. 

the only skills i have are domestic, like cooking, cleaning, child care, etc. the only professional experience i have is nannying, i had 2 long ish term families and i can only reference one since the 2nd was so chaotic. 

a lot of my past jobs left me burnt out and i would quit under stress, i can‚Äôt reference them. i always genuinely did my best and gave 110%, but after a while i got tired/stressed and then things would get bad, mentally and at work, and i would be forced to quit. i‚Äôve never been fired luckily, but the longest i‚Äôve stayed was like 8 months at a grocery store when i was 16 lol. 

2.5 weeks ago i went to a vocational rehab place, they said they could help. waited a week for the appointment just to have to wait 2.5 weeks now for them to get my medical records before they can even attempt to help. i‚Äôve been sending out applications, calling, showing up to introduce myself, i‚Äôm doing everything i can think of. i‚Äôm already so anxious that this is taking a toll on me, idk what to do. 

my bf has been supporting me and i feel awful, i do everything at home for him and prep his breakfast/lunches for work at least. i need a job like now, but nobody is responding. like plsss i‚Äôll be a good employee for like 4 months üôè lmao jokes aside, idk how to proceed. 

i need to take care of my mental and physical health first, but i need money for the appointments. but i can‚Äôt get money until im not crazy anymore. and even still, it‚Äôs just luck/chance after that, and it‚Äôll take months to get any progress. 

vocational rehab place said they still haven‚Äôt gotten my records as of yesterday. legit what do i even do? i‚Äôm so stressed, i genuinely don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. i hope yall have some advice, id appreciate anything rn. ",1,1756910425.0,findapath,1,1.0,False

I have a friend with whom I meet every Thursday for dinner and to watch Doctor Who (or another fantasy/sci-fi show). We met during yoga, but really bonded over our shared love of geekery, scifi, and fantasy. We have been hanging out on Thursdays for almost two years, and I've always hosted. This is because she doesn't have a TV at home, and instead watches her shows on her computer. I have a large TV and comfortable seating, so it made sense. We don't do much other than this, though we have gone to see a movie together once or twice.

We often order food, pick it up, and bring it back to eat. When we do order food, she has traditionally driven, and at one point, she stated that it was fair because I always host. Sometimes I cook dinner specifically for us (though the leftovers are for me), and sometimes we eat stuff I have made already. She doesn't help me cook, nor does she do the dishes, though she often puts them in the sink and rinses them. This is okay with me; I don't have a dishwasher, and I don't expect guests to help me hand-wash things. For every two times that I cook, she will buy dinner for me. We usually go to reasonably priced places ($15-20) to eat.

Everything was fine until the other day, when she commented, ""It would be ok if you drove more,"" and her tone clearly suggested that she felt I didn't. I thought about it for a minute and stated, ""Are you planning on hosting at any point?"" She looked slightly startled and noted that she would, but didn't have a TV, and I dropped it.  I brought it up later, realizing I needed to hear more, and started the conversation by saying, ""I think it's fair that you drive, because I always host."" She looked embarrassed and agreed, but then commented, ""I guess it's hard to get your place ready."" I have ADHD, and organization is always a struggle. I agreed and let it go, but I still can't help feeling off.

She's never invited me to her place for coffee or to see it, though I have suggested multiple times that I would like to see some of the renovations she has done. During the conversation, she did not acknowledge that I often cook (and then do the dishes without a dishwasher), and I also realized that recently she doesn't always say thank you when I do. The few times I have asked her to pick up food without me, so I could get he house in order, or cook something to eat, she stated, ""I would prefer if you went with me."" I have asked her to help cook (chopping, stirring, etc.), and she seems uncomfortable, sometimes making excuses, although I know she doesn't really know how to cook. I have also asked her to learn how to use the remote, so she can get the show started while I am preparing food. She states it's too complicated.  All of this being said, I genuinely enjoy her company; we have great conversations that I don't really have with other friends, and I know she is a good person. I also suspect she might be on the autism spectrum, though undiagnosed.

SO...  I don't want to lose a friend, but I don't like feeling like I am being taken for granted or used. Am I overreacting to her comment and behavior? If not, any suggestions on how I can handle this in a way that maintains the friendship?

  
EDIT: I should clarify this after receiving a few responses - I don't think she is trying to take advantage, and I don't want either of us to feel like we are being taken for granted or used. I beleive that perception is the problem here, and I am trying to see if it is mine or hers.  If it's mine, I let it go. If it's hers, I want to talk to her and need advice on how to bring it up gently because I don't want to hurt her feelings or make her feel bad for having a feeling about something.

While many people see the glamorous side of successful events, here are five things no one tells you about what it's really like to get started in the industry:

1. **You'll Wear More Hats Than You Can Imagine.** It's not just about creative vision. In the beginning, you're the salesperson, marketer, accountant, and logistics coordinator. You might be negotiating with a venue one hour and setting up chairs the next. This multi-faceted experience is a crash course in the entire business and is invaluable for your growth.
2. **Your ""Office"" is Everywhere.** Forget a typical 9-to-5 desk job. Your workplace is constantly changing‚Äîfrom coffee shops and client offices to warehouses and the event site itself. This requires a new level of adaptability and organization, as you must be productive in any environment.
3. **The Highs and Lows Are Extreme.** The adrenaline rush of a flawless event is unparalleled. However, the stress of unexpected problems‚Äîlike a last-minute vendor cancellation or bad weather‚Äîcan be intense. Learning to stay calm under pressure and think on your feet is a critical skill that comes with experience.
4. **Networking is Your Lifeline.** Your professional network is more than just a list of contacts; it's a support system. Having a strong relationship with vendors, mentors, and other event professionals is crucial. They can offer advice, connect you with opportunities, and even bail you out of a tough situation.
5. **Perfectionism is Your Biggest Enemy.** While attention to detail is essential, the pursuit of absolute perfection will burn you out. Events are dynamic, and something will inevitably go wrong. The key is to learn how to manage and mitigate issues gracefully, rather than trying to prevent every single one. Learning to let go and focus on the big picture is the mark of a seasoned event planner.",1,1756909902.0,u_Yasdigitals,0,1.0,False

[**My [34M] ex-wife [32F] divorced me after she got cancer so that she could ""leave"" first, now she wants to come back - should I give her another chance?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/13p9bem/comment/jlac9yw/)

I met my wife (I'll call her Anna) during our first year of university. We dated through university and got married right after her graduation. Things were happy for about a while until Anna discovered a lump in her right breast. I encouraged her to have it checked out; she was reluctant to do so, but utlimately did because breast cancer runs in her family. And sure enough, that's what she had.

The good news - if it can be considered good news - was that the breast cancer she had was extremely treatable with chemo and radiation. Based n her family history her doctor also recommended a double masectomy for her. This put Anna in a REALLY dark place. I suggested she go to therapy but she outright refused and said she never wanted to hear me suggest that again. So I did my best to be encouraging and supportive to her. I took time off work to be at every appointment with her, I took on 100% of the household chores both inside and out, I did all of the shopping, I drove Anna everywhere she wanted to go, I planned out special dates for us, I gave her an hour-long foot massage every night, I literally did whatever I could.

About six weeks into her treatment, Anna brought up the idea of going to stay with her sister Sarah for a week. This honestly relieved me as I was burning the candle at both ends trying to accomplish everything, and I thought some time apart would help us both.Two nights into her stay with Sarah, Anna called me and said she wanted a divorce. She said she had read a lot about men who abandon their wives when their wives get sick, and that she was determined to leave me before I could leave her.

I can't put into words how much this crushed me. I loved my wife. She was my everything. I begged her to reconsider. I told her I had NEVER thought of leaving her, not even once. I asked her again to go to therapy. She refused again. I asked her to go to couple's therapy with me. She wouldn't. I asked her what I could do to convince her I wanted to stay. She said there was nothing. I am a man and therefore I would leave. End of story.

It took about a year because of where we live (thanks COVID) but eventually everything was finalized. I ended up selling the house and splitting the proceeds between me and my now ex-wife. I didn't want to stay in that town anymore, so I put in a transfer request at my job and ended up moving to a town about 2 hours away. For the past couple of years, I've been focusing on myself more. I got a dog. I've been on a few dates but nothing serious. I picked up hiking as a hobby and started gardening.

Out of the blue, Anna called me three weeks ago. She said she'd been in town on a trip with friends and saw me, and all of her old feelings rushed back. She said she was sick and out of her mind at the time, and that I couldn't hold her words or her actions against her. She said she still loved me, that she always had, and that she regretted leaving me. She begged me to give her another chanace.

I'm.... so confused. If I'm being honest, I still love Anna but I'm no longer IN love with her. She broke my heart. I was devastated when she ended things. It took me a long time to get my head on right. But I also know she really was in a bad place because of the cancer. Do I owe it to her and what we had to hear her out? I'm scared that if we reconnect, I'll always feel like she'll have one foot out the door. But maybe that's unfair? I don't know what to do. Should I give her another chance like she wants?

>I never recommend couples getting back together unless the issues that drove them apart are ‚Äúfixed.‚Äù Cancer was not the problem. (Lack of) communication, trust and a willingness to compromise was (on her end). She made unilateral decisions without caring how it affected you. She refused therapy. The way you‚Äôre writing this, it‚Äôs still all about what she wants. Which sounds like the dynamic that destroyed your marriage. So what changed?

>I wouldn‚Äôt do it. But if you want to open the door, you need to start with brutally honest couples therapy (and her active and honest participation is non-negotiable and a deal-breaker otherwise). Have the therapy to hash out and bury the past, and see if DATING is an eventual possibility. You guys need to start from scratch.

>And it‚Äôs ok if you try it and you can‚Äôt ‚Äúmove on‚Äù like she expects you to. She hurt you, regardless of her motivations. Sometimes you can‚Äôt undo things.

>**u/Mundane-Currency5088**
>>Like going to therapy during an extremely difficult traumatic time in your life is something you shut down and demand your loved one NEVER mentions becoming emotionally healthy ever again....If you do try again therapy should be non negotiable

>>She said she was sick and out of her mind at the time, and that I couldn't hold her words or her actions against her.

>She hasn't changed, here she is refusing to take responsibility for her actions when you both know you gave her every opportunity to find help. If she really wanted to make things work with you why did it take her seeing you by chance to do something? No, she's just lonely and is trying to shoot her shot because she's betting you're not over her.

>**u/Chaosr21**
>>Exactly. She's over 30 and still won't even take responsibility for her actions. Cancer doesn't change your personality like that, not your values. She's the same person who divorced him and hasn't changed.

>That‚Äôs rough mate. You don‚Äôt owe her anything. The divorce took a year then you were apart for 2 years. Why did it take her so long to realise leaving you was a mistake. Personally I wouldn‚Äôt take her back.

>**u/[deleted]**
>>Because she was seeing someone else 100%.

>She's not sincere. Look at what she told you.

>""I always loved you and regretted leaving.""

>""I'd been in town on a trip and saw you, and all my feelings came rushing back.""

>Where'd they rush back from if she always loved you and always regretted leaving?

>She feels guilty for hurting someone who loved her. If you take her back, she will feel forgiven- that bygones have become bygones. But when her guilt goes away, it doesn't mean she starts loving you. It just means she doesn't have the guilt to motivate her to make it up to you. She'll be back in a relationship with a guy she doesn't love and has already left once.

>Go pet your dog and let ""nothing serious"" become something. She's guilty, not lovestruck, and you're grieving, not lovesick. If you can do so sincerely, forgive her. That could prove cathartic for you both in moving forward. Has she even apologized to you?

[**[Update] My [34M] ex-wife [32F] divorced me after she got cancer so that she could ""leave"" first, now she wants to come back - should I give her another chance?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/13srk7p/update_my_34m_exwife_32f_divorced_me_after_she/) 

Firstly, I'd like to say thank you to everyone who left comments on my original post. I now know what people mean when they say ""RIP my inbox"". I posted that and went to bed never expecting it would blow up so much. By the time I woke up, the post was locked (not sure why) so I couldn't respond to any comments. But I read as many as I could, and tried to take everything into consideration.

Many of you suggested I reach out to my ex-wife ""Anna"" for an in-person conversation; the overwhelming consensus was that meeting her in person would tell me all I needed to know... and you were right. That seemed reasonable to me. I texted her and she jumped at the chance to meet, and we did so yesterday after I was done work. I chose to ask her to meet at a local coffee shop. Maybe it sounds bad, but I didn't want to meet her at my house or anywhere private just in case.

Anyway, Anna was already there when I got there. She got up and hugged me. I let her, but didn't hug her back. Then we sat down. I asked her to remain quiet while I talked and then I told her everything. I'm gonna sum it up here because I honestly don't remember everything I said. I think I talked for like ten minutes solid while she just sat there and teared up.

But I told her things like how much she had devastated me. I told her that I would have stuck with her through thick and thin, no matter what. I told her that I loved her, and that hadn't changde after her diagnosis or treatment plan. I told her that I was broken after she initiated the divorce. I told her how hard it was for me to pull myself back together. A lot of you pointed out that if Anna and I got back together, I should be worried about what she would do the next time she got sick - or if I got sick. And you were right. So I told her that too. And she got mad and interrupted me at that point.

She said I was being unfair. That I wasn't taken into consideration her mental health at the time. She said she wasn't thinking straight, but that now she was. I took the chance to ask her if she'd been to therapy. She told me she hadn't, and that she had no plans to, and that she didn't need it. I have to admit, that crushed me a little.

I asked her why.

Just... WHY? It's the one question I've really wrestled with over the months. And she said that she'd gone looking for support groups and found a lot of women who had stories about their partners leaving. She even mentioned Reddit, funnily enough. She said she talked it through with her sister ""Sarah"". Anna said that Sarah, to her credit, had tried to dissuade her from divorcing me. But that between social media and some of Anna's friends, Anna felt like she ""had to go through with it to be seen as a strong woman"".

That is word for word what she said to me. I don't remember anything else exactly but I will never forget that. She broke my heart and threw away our relationship because somehow in her mind that translated to being strong.

She then started trying to tell me we could get back together again, but at that point I just told her flat-out that wasn't happening. What it comes down to for me is that I just can't trust her. I would always be worrying about the same thing happening again. She cried a lot and tried convincing me for a little while. When I got up to leave, she threw her iced coffee in my face and stormed out.

So yeah. We're definitely not getting back together. I have the closure I always wanted. I wish it felt better. I've been dwelling on it for the past day and a half. I keep wondering if there's something I could've done better, some way I could've saved our relationship. But I know there's not. I've blocked her number. I kind of hope I never hear from her again.

>I‚Äôm glad you got the closure you needed. She seems like she‚Äôs always trying to save face and puts her reputation over anything else. She even did it when she through the drink in your face; she saw you getting ready to walk away and she didn‚Äôt want the perception that dumped her in public so she did that to make you look like the villain. I hope you find happiness moving forward and meet someone who truly understands ‚Äúthrough sickness and health.‚Äù Be strong brother!

‚ÄúHey, Sis.¬† What would happen if you fought this guy?‚Äù

I almost whistled.¬† After a little breaking in, Hiyla was much more receptive to the world of martial arts and fantasy matchups.¬† Now, she was holding up a book ‚Ä¶ *an actual, physical book ‚Ä¶* pages open to barrel-chested Human in primitive attire.¬† Hayou must have lent it to her.

My ears flicked with amusement.¬† ‚ÄúI dunno.¬† It depends on how well he can ‚Ä¶ he can ‚Ä¶‚Äù

I trailed off upon *really* looking at the image.¬† It was a Human in a loin cloth.¬† His burly build brought a Takkan to mind.¬† He brandished a stick with a pointy, stone tip.¬† It felt like a crude hunting weapon, but it was his eyes ‚Ä¶ fierce.¬† Intense.¬† They held that Human spark I‚Äôd seen behind the primates‚Äô gazes, but ‚Ä¶ *different.*¬† The eyes stuck with me and I didn‚Äôt know why.

I‚Äôm not sure when I‚Äôd taken the book from Hiyla, but I knew it was in my paws as I paced, gaze glued to the image.¬† My tail twitched in tandem with the itch at the back of my mind.¬† There was a catch to this, and I didn‚Äôt know what.

Hiyla raised her ears towards me.

‚ÄúHe looks strong.¬† Big and strong,‚Äù I began.¬† ‚ÄúGormin was strong too, so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôd be helpless.¬† How tall are we talking here?‚Äù

She tail-signed for me to flip the page, and I did.¬† I wasn‚Äôt used to way paper sort of pinched between your paw pads.¬† After fumbling to separate three pages, I found a spread where the guy was standing beside what I knew to be the average Human.¬† Seeing a one-to-one comparison, the distinctions popped out at me.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not tall, compared to the average Human,‚Äù I concluded.¬† ‚ÄúHowever, he‚Äôs strongly built, and ‚Ä¶ I keep thinking how weird it would be to put him in a choke-hold, or any hold, actually.¬† I think my grips would mostly work, but it‚Äôs be like squashing a circle around a squarish circle.¬† I‚Äôve never seen a Human like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh.¬† Then you‚Äôre seeing it,‚Äù Hiyla ear-flicked with a note of jealousy.¬† ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see it.¬† Hayou had to spell it out for me.¬† Dress this guy up, teach him Eng-a‚Äôa‚Äôa-lish, then you pass him on the street and he‚Äôd pass for a ‚Äòwonky‚Äô Human, if you notice ‚Ä¶ which I didn‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, *‚Äòpass for‚Äô?‚Äù* I squinted.¬† ‚ÄúHiyla, are you saying he‚Äôs not Human?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.¬† He‚Äôs Human,‚Äù Hiyla declared, reaching over and flipping the page.¬† This one had two skulls.

I stared.

Hiyla tapped the left one.¬† ‚ÄúThis is his skull.¬† The other one is like the Humans we‚Äôve met.‚Äù

It was obvious now: big jaws, broad brow, long braincase.¬† Compared to the Humans I knew, this was a monster.

‚ÄúIs this real?‚Äù I queried.

‚ÄúYep,‚Äù Hiyla flicked.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with him?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing‚Äôs wrong with him.¬† That‚Äôs how he‚Äôs supposed to look.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs in ‚Ä¶ ethnically?‚Äù

‚ÄúAs in *species.‚Äù*

My tail stilled.¬† ‚ÄúYou said he was Human.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd he *is.*¬† Just a different *type* of Human,‚Äù she explained.¬† ‚ÄúThis guy‚Äôs a *Homo neanderthals.*¬† They had bigger brains than our Humans, so some thought they might have been smarter.¬† Stronger, too, but they were shorter and slower, with less stamina.¬† They might have been less social, so they never worked together quite like our Humans.¬† That could be why they didn‚Äôt survive.¬† Then there‚Äôs *Homo erectus.*¬† They grew way faster than the Humans we know, but they were dumber and shorter.¬† There but the Denisovans were straight up giants!¬† ‚Ä¶ Or not.¬† Many think that they were kind of short, but based on the size of their teeth, some assumed they were giants.‚Äù

I blinked at the overload.¬† What were they like?¬† Did they have martial arts?¬† What would that even look like?¬† Why did she keep talking in the past tense?

‚ÄúThe Humans never told me they had other species ‚Ä¶‚Äù I mused.

‚ÄúBecause they‚Äôre all dead.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶ Wut?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Humans we have are the only ones left,‚Äù Hiyla clarified.¬† ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre *Homo sapiens.*¬† Twenty one Human species, and all the others are dead ‚Ä¶‚Äù

***‚ÄúTwenty one!?‚Äù*** I bleated.

She tail-shrugged.¬† ‚ÄúIt depends on what you call ‚ÄòHuman‚Äô and ‚Äòspecies‚Äô, though.¬† Neanderthals could, and did, make pups with humans.¬† The Humans we know have a little Neanderthal in them.¬† The genes boost their immune systems a bit, so maybe they were the same type of thing?¬† Like how chihuahuas are tiny, but Rottweilers could knock you down and drag you into the bush, never to be seen again.‚Äù

And she‚Äôd said it so casually.

‚ÄúThe point is they‚Äôre still dogs. ¬†Even if they don‚Äôt look like it, they‚Äôre one big family ‚Ä¶ but maybe the Humans didn‚Äôt always see it that way.¬† There‚Äôs some evidence that many of these early Humans were ca-cannibals, even when they didn‚Äôt need to be.¬† That includes the *Homo sapiens* ‚Ä¶ th-the species we‚Äôve met ‚Ä¶ their ancestors ‚Ä¶‚Äù

I felt my heard sink through the soil.¬† *My* Humans?¬† Descended from *cannibals?*¬† I leaned against the table, my tail thumping.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt they say anything?‚Äù I wondered aloud.

Hiyla tail-shrugged.¬† ‚ÄúThey might not have even known.¬† This is the distant past.¬† Hayou only stumbled on this by accident.¬† I‚Äôve already had my freak-out session, *sooo ‚Ä¶‚Äù*

She‚Äôd trailed off with this far-off, unresolved look in her eye.

*‚ÄúOur* Humans are good,‚Äù I decided aloud, both for her sake and for mine.

‚Äú‚Ä¶ I know ‚Ä¶‚Äù Hiyla agreed distractedly.

‚ÄúIs ‚Ä¶ something else bothering you?‚Äù I ventured.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so much the Humans don‚Äôt know about their past, and they didn‚Äôt have a Federation to take it from them,‚Äù Hiyla contemplated.¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help wondering how much *we* don‚Äôt know.¬† What if we weren‚Äôt the only Venlil ‚Ä¶ or *Skalgans* on the planet?¬† What if we had cousins?¬† A great, big family, even?¬† What could they have been like?¬† Were they bigger than us?¬† Stronger?¬† *Smarter?*¬† Did they think like us?¬† Would they have seen us as people if we weren‚Äôt as strong or smart as they were?¬† Would we have seen them as people?  What did they eat?¬† Were they prey?¬† Were *we* their prey?¬† Or did they recognize us as family?¬† Did they work together in some big civilization of species, like The Federation, but *good?*¬† Were they more good than bad, or more bad than good?¬† What if everything they did, everything they were, is gone forever, and *we‚Äôd never know?‚Äù*

*Date \[standardized human time\]: April 18th, 2123.*

**--------------**

This was boring.

Dozens of little surgical tools nibbled and fiddled at my wounds.¬† It almost tickled, I think.¬† I imagined I felt like one of those crocodiles with birds in its mouth, picking its teeth clean.

I tried to follow the process.¬† Maybe I‚Äôd pick up a few tricks to patch myself up.¬† Thanks to the restraints, it was hard to ask the A.I. what it was doing when I couldn‚Äôt point out what it was doing.¬† Trying to describe it was a bother.¬† Much more fun when they let actual doctors patch me up.

**--------------**

***Temporal Transposition:*** *Date \[standardized human time\]: February 3rd, 2122*

**--------------**

‚ÄúHey.¬† What‚Äôs that all about?‚Äù I asked, tail-pointing at the organ my surgeons worked on.

The Yotul doctor paled.¬† ‚ÄúI thought you put him under!‚Äù

‚ÄúI **did!‚Äù the** Zurulean Doctor insisted.¬† ‚ÄúHe just keeps shaking it off ‚Ä¶ ***HEY!*** ¬†D**on‚Äôt touch that!‚Äù**

*‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù* I queried, hovering my claw above the pulsating lump of flesh.¬† ‚ÄúYou said my immune system‚Äôs an absolute monster.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt mean you go **poking your claws into your** ***open abdominal cavity!‚Äù*** Doc Yotul squealed.

‚ÄúBut I wanna know what it feels like!‚Äù I snapped back, before spotting something half-hidden a bit deeper.¬† *‚ÄúOooh!*¬† Is that my squeedlyspooch?¬† It looks cool!‚Äù

‚ÄúFor the third time, Brkar, **you** ***DON‚ÄôT*** **have a squeedlyspooch!‚Äù**

Doc Yotul was just about ready to pull out some fur.

‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs his fireseed,‚Äù Doc Zurulean noted.¬† ‚ÄúSome Venlil have them, but it‚Äôs prone to cancer and bursting for no apparent reason.¬† ‚Äù

‚ÄúLike an appendix?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúWe are men of science,‚Äù Doc Zurulean huffed haughtily.¬† ‚ÄúMade-up words like ‚Äòappendix‚Äô have no place on our lips ‚Ä¶ anyway, we should remove it.¬† Don‚Äôt want it popping during your shenanigans.‚Äù

Doc Yotul‚Äôs paw shot to his colleague‚Äôs shoulder.¬† **‚ÄúNo.‚Äù**

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, *‚Äòno‚Äô?‚Äù* huffed Doc Zurulean.¬† ‚ÄúHow long have you been practicing?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter,‚Äù Doc Yotul snipped.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been in the program far longer than you have.¬† We have been instructed **not** to remove the fireseed.¬† If anything happens, we **fix it,** or replace it.¬† Brkar‚Äôs condition is ‚Ä¶ *unique.‚Äù*

**--------------**

***Temporal Transposition:*** *Date \[standardized human time\]: April 18th, 2123.*

**--------------**

I couldn‚Äôt see my ~~squeedlyspooch~~ fireseed this time around.¬† Maybe that meant the damage wasn‚Äôt as bad ‚Ä¶ or it was worse, but dispersed more across my body.¬† *Yeah.*¬† That felt about right.

Once the stable patched me up, I‚Äôd spend a few paws in a nutrient bath until I was good as brand-spanking new.

I was ***not*** looking forward to that.

Sure, I was *supposed* to be unconscious for the brunt of it.¬† The stable pod was trying to put me under, and I wasn‚Äôt cooperating.

‚ÄúMaster Brkar, please try to relax,‚Äù requested the medical A.I.

‚ÄúUh ‚Ä¶ no,‚Äù I grunted for the fourth time.

That wasn‚Äôt to say I didn‚Äôt feel like sleeping.¬† Though I couldn‚Äôt feel pain, per se, I had a fairly keen sense of bodily damage when I actually paid attention.¬† Maybe that‚Äôs what pain was, and everyone else just overreacted for some reason.¬† I wasn‚Äôt sure.¬† However, there was this weariness that crept over me after a big, messy fight.¬† And hunger, but the intravenous feeding tubes were taking the edge off the latter part.¬† It was easy enough to push past all that, and if it wasn‚Äôt?¬† I‚Äôd do it anyway.¬† Some auto-surgeon wasn‚Äôt gonna make *me* go beddy bye bye.¬† Not when my parents tried it all and failed.¬† Besides, if I was reading this holo display right, the autosurgeon was slowly increasing my dosage.¬† Currently, I was at 1.4x the dosage of a normal Venlil.¬† I wanted to see how high that number could get before I passed out.

My ear flicked up.¬† Pawsteps.

I craned my neck to see the approaching party.¬† The restraints didn‚Äôt give much wiggle room, and the stable‚Äôs glass portal only went so far to the side.¬† Taking his sweet time, my enemy finally stepped before me.

Oh.¬† That guy.

My tail tried to wag in the restraints.

*‚ÄúStable, I want out,‚Äù* I hissed.

‚ÄúAutosurgery is not complete,‚Äù it stated.¬†

‚ÄúI said ***I want out!‚Äù*** I growled.

‚ÄúAnd what will you do when you get your ‚Äòout‚Äô?‚Äù asked the shepherd.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll punch you,‚Äù I declared.¬† ‚ÄúStable, override.‚Äù

‚ÄúOverride denied.‚Äù

**‚ÄúSince** ***WHEN!?‚Äù*** I snarled.

Going silent, I poured power into my muscles.¬† The surgical instruments winced back as the stable‚Äôs steel groaned.

That guy brayed loud, long and hard.¬† ***‚ÄúBAHAHAHA!***¬† **You‚Äôre trying to force your way out of that thing?¬† What will you even do, with your guts airing out like that?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúI** ***said.¬† I‚Äôll punch you,‚Äù*** I rumbled.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point of fighting if you‚Äôre dead?‚Äù he queried.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point of living if you can‚Äôt fight?‚Äù I countered.

He stared at me.¬† In his eyes, ears and tail, I saw amazement, astonishment, then annoyance.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre strong.  Not unstoppable, but you act like you‚Äôre invincible.¬† Seven cycles old and you‚Äôre taller than most.¬† At ten cycles, you‚Äôll more or less reach your full height.¬† You grow fast so you can fight faster.¬† You don‚Äôt feel pain and you don‚Äôt know when to quit.¬† The body of a terror bird with the self-preservation instincts of a dodo.  I‚Äôm starting to understand why you‚Äôre all gone.¬† The Clevers must have kept you in check.‚Äù

*‚Äú‚ÄòAll gone‚Äô?*¬† You going senile, old man?¬† I‚Äôm *right here,‚Äù* I sneered.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre *here* because we *brought you back,‚Äù* he intoned, ‚Äúyet you‚Äôre. ¬†*Oh. ¬†So.* ¬†***Eager.***  To return to the dirt.¬† I can‚Äôt help wondering if it was worth it ‚Ä¶‚Äù

**‚ÄúStart making sense, old goat!‚Äù** I roared.¬† **‚ÄúYou think I don‚Äôt know the state I‚Äôm in!?¬† What happens when I‚Äôm up against twenty Kolshians, with a Mazic leading the charge?¬† What happens when it‚Äôs a crew full of Arxur, and there‚Äôs no stable in sight!¬† I** ***need*** **to learn how to push past the impossible, to smash dead ends to victories!¬† A Strong Venlil** ***always makes a way!‚Äù***

Funny.¬† I almost thought I‚Äôd heard Mother‚Äôs distant brays of dismay.¬† I angled an ear ‚Ä¶ oh.¬† Yes.¬† That was definitely her.¬† She was probably lamenting over how she planted ‚ÄòThe Hope Experiment‚Äô in my mind.¬† From the sound of it, Dad and Rebra were taking turns headbutting the console.¬† That little Venlil better not give herself a concussion.¬† It wasn‚Äôt like I could stop her, so I focused on the here and now.

‚ÄúI thought you were some big, bad, boogeyman, but all you‚Äôve got is *talk!‚Äù* I hissed.¬† ‚ÄúIf you won‚Äôt teach me how to get Stronger, then ***get your fluff out of my sight!‚Äù***

A click.¬† The sound of shifting metal.¬† Another pen door was rising.¬† Yellow, slitted eyes peered low beneath, catching the light with an eerie shine.

Another Arxur.

Unlike the first, there was no scratching or flailing to get at the prey.¬† As the door rose, the Arxur rose with it, going from four legs to two.¬† Calm, analytical eyes swept The Field.¬† This one was different.

Those eyes fell on the Arxur I defeated, darting between him and us Venlil.¬† He withered under her gaze.

*‚ÄúRunt,‚Äù* she hissed, ‚Äúhow did the Venlil get you like this?¬† You‚Äôre covered in orange, so that big pup wounded in the capsule did this to you?¬† A *pup?*¬† **A** ***PUP?‚Äù***

My jaw went loose, heart went tight with wrath.¬† That guy *had me fight a* ***runt?***

‚ÄúC-Captain ‚Ä¶‚Äù sniveled the Arxur runt, hiding his face.¬† ‚ÄúForgive m-me, Captain ‚Ä¶‚Äù

[The old goat strode towards her.¬†](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ2x9ybAxL4) His steps were slow and settled, like he was taking a stroll through a garden.

She tilted her head and stepped onto The Field.¬† I saw the confusion in her eyes as she scanned the old man.¬† Onceover.¬† Twiceover.¬† Three times and counting.¬† She wasn‚Äôt going to rush in and get destroyed.¬† Not like the ‚Äòrunt‚Äô, but she *was* an Arxur.¬† A captain, no less.¬† She wouldn‚Äôt, *couldn‚Äôt,* back down.

Even if her alarms were braying.

She took a stance as he neared.

‚ÄúHeh, look at me, taking a Venlil seriously,‚Äù she sneered, ‚Äúespecially an old wrinkle like you.‚Äù

Was she trying to bait him into doing something rash?¬† *Clever girl,* but he didn‚Äôt react.¬† Just kept walking.

The Captain bared her teeth.¬† ‚ÄúNot gonna stop, huh?¬† Fine.¬† Just walk into my-‚Äù

She swung.¬† Mid-sentence.¬† It could have taken off his head, but her claws hit air.¬† I‚Äôd barely seen him move.¬† No flinch.¬† No parry.¬† The blur he‚Äôd become was darting in.¬† His paw flickered into her arm as he whisked past it.¬† Claws first.¬† Like a knife hand, or a *spear.*¬† His other paw reached her stomach.

The shock on her face.¬† The *pain.*

Scarcely had she began to hunch in anguish when he spiraled into the air.¬† Coiled like a spring, his tail unwound against the ground, pushing him higher and faster than I‚Äôd ever seen a Venlil leap.¬† His foot shot up, lancing into her neck.

Her jaws flew open.¬† Chest heaved.¬† A silent scream that never made it out.¬† The windpipe must have collapsed.

She fell back.¬† He was still airborne.¬† His tail whirled up and looped behind her neck, drawing them close. ¬†Even as she fell, she swung her good arm.¬† It was sloppy.¬† Desperate.¬† He leaned into it.¬† His paw speared the joint and it went limp.¬† Both arms, useless.

His paws flickered to her face.¬† Left eye.¬† Right eye.¬† Neck.¬† Neck.¬† *Neck.*¬† ***Neck.***¬† His attacks were blinding-fast and efficient, like a machine, but I sensed the *wrath* behind them.

She crashed to the ground.

The captain squirmed for air, for purchase, but she was fading fast.¬† It happened too quickly.

She didn‚Äôt even realize it was over.

The Arxur I‚Äôd defeated looked on in silent horror, tears dripping from his snout.

The Shepherd stepped off her and sauntered towards me, is wool flecked the same red as his formal scarf.¬† His little accessory would stain, but no one would notice the red on red.

‚Ä¶

Wait ‚Ä¶

Had he worn the color, *knowing* this would happen?¬† Knowing I‚Äôd challenge him, but in the end, he‚Äôd fight an Arxur?¬† That the scarf would stain red, not orange?¬† I thought I‚Äôd initiated this, but maybe I‚Äôd been dancing on his paw the whole time.

He strode up to me with that same, settled nonchalance, but I saw something burning behind his eyes.¬† Disgust.¬† *Rage.* ¬†His paws were locked in that same, piercing, position he‚Äôd used to take apart the Arxur captain.¬† Like *spears.*

The Shepherd stopped in front of me.¬† Our eyes locked for a long scratch.

‚ÄúYou *struggled ‚Ä¶* against a *runt ‚Ä¶‚Äù* he stated.

Suddenly, his spit splatted into the glass shielding my face.¬† His voice dropped deep and ugly.¬† I‚Äôd never heard another Venlil growl, never seen him lose his cool, until now.¬† He never raised his voice.¬† His wrath was calm, yet it burnt like the all-consuming mass of a red giant.

**‚ÄúYou** ***struggled.***¬† **Against a** ***runt.‚Äù***

Behind his eyes, I saw a beast in the flames.¬† He wanted to tear me apart.¬† I could feel it.¬† He probably could.

**‚ÄúWe ... ran** ***impossible missions*** **‚Ä¶ lost** ***good*** **soldiers ... burned through credits by the** ***billions ‚Ä¶*** **all to** **Frankenstein you and your Clever back to life, and an** ***undersized Arxur*** **put** ***you*** **in a Stable?¬† Every one of my sheepdogs can take on a squad of Arxur, but they‚Äôre only** ***Commons.¬† I‚ÄôM*** **only Common.¬† To stand against The Federation, you‚Äôll need to be** ***more.***¬† **Your training is** ***pathetic.***¬† **Your Strength Is** ***pathetic.¬† YOU*** **are** ***pathetic.***¬† **If you can‚Äôt surpass a Common like me, then you have** ***no right to call yourself a Strong.‚Äù***

He walked away, his tail lashing with caged ferocity that belied the calmness in his steps.

My ears dropped as my defiant fires snuffed out.

I had nothing to say.

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Memory transcription subject: Brkar, A Strong Venlil**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: June 4th, 2140.*

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

After all these cycles, a sheepdog stood before me again.¬† I wasn‚Äôt scared, exactly.¬† I don‚Äôt think my emotions bleated quite the same as other Venlil.¬† My tail gave a tentative wag.¬† This paw was special.¬† A sheepdog, all for me!¬† But still, knowing there was a Common, *here,* who could be this big of a threat?¬† I was ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. *concerned?*¬† Is that what I was feeling?

I couldn‚Äôt play with him like the Arxur.¬† When this went down, I needed to lean into my Strong blood while somehow being Clever at the same time.¬† I missed the weight of Rebra clinging to my shoulder.¬† It was like living without an arm.

Every now and then, a Common managed to be Strong and Clever.¬† Maybe this Common would be the one to bring me down, but he‚Äôd have to earn it, that glorious win. ¬†I‚Äôd *make* him earn it.

I took a swig of coffee.¬† This was gonna be a long paw, wasn‚Äôt it?

‚ÄúCome to slay the big bad wolf, eh?‚Äù I grinned.

The gray Venlil stopped short, gazing down at his utility belt.¬† After a moment‚Äôs hesitation, he removed it and set it down on a table.

‚ÄúI just want to talk,‚Äù he declared.

‚ÄúThen join me for cup of Joe,‚Äù I beckoned.¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what Gojid puts in this stuff, but it‚Äôs *good.‚Äù*

I never liked cheap tricks, but I needed all the advantages I could get.¬† If I could just get him close, lower his guard just a little ‚Ä¶

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the sheepdog declared.

Yep.¬† Of course.

I shooed him with my tail.¬† ‚ÄúThen wait your turn.¬† This is my first time out for a good coffee, and I shall savour it.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.¬† I am to ext- to ex ‚Ä¶ I am to *take you in,‚Äù* the sheepdog declared.

How hard was it for him to even say that?¬† That training did a number on the brain.

‚ÄúOooh!¬† A *Freudian slip!‚Äù* I purred.¬† ‚ÄúThen why‚Äôd you say you were here to talk?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to talk *first.*¬† Then you need to come with me,‚Äù he clarified.¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre looking at me with both eyes, lining up the distance, which means you‚Äôre planning to fight.¬† *Don‚Äôt.*¬† ***Please.***¬† You know it‚Äôs not gonna end-‚Äù

‚ÄúI *know* what you are, *sheepdog,‚Äù* I declared.¬† ‚ÄúI know what you do, and talking‚Äôs not a part of it.‚Äù

His gaze darkened.¬† I could practically see the memories flooding back to him.¬† Behind his eyes, a beast awoke, forged of flames that burnt silent.

I‚Äôd unlocked him.

Without a code, there were two ingredients to unleash a sub-shepherd sheepdog:

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Show that you know what they are.

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Be a big enough threat to The Herd.

Yeah.¬† Tick those off the list.

Arms to paws, his muscles and bones locked into that ancient technique.¬† ***The Hunter‚Äôs Spear:*** *Killer of giants and monsters.*

‚ÄúLook at you, posturing on the moral high ground.¬† Now you‚Äôre figuring out ten different ways to kill me,‚Äù I rumbled, rising to approach him.¬† ‚ÄúTalking never suited your kind, but it‚Äôs better this way, yeah?¬† Why don‚Äôt we cut to it and destroy eachothe-‚Äù

*k‚Äôk‚Äôlik!*

Wait, wut?

Something pulled me back by the wrist.¬† I looked to find myself handcuffed to the bolted won chair.¬† As for the Houdini Yotul was *supposed* to be my ‚Äòcuff buddy?¬† I couldn‚Äôt see much of him beyond the scalding splash of coffee he was hurling at my face.

My arm shot up, but I was too slow.¬† I closed my eyes.¬† Half the stuff found my muzzle and eyes.¬† Nerves zapped little damage warnings, like static pops.¬† Enough to jolt my self-preservation instincts without actually hurting.¬† I think, if I‚Äôd been Common, I‚Äôd be screaming or something.

*‚ÄúHyeeeeehyeehyeehyeehyeeh!‚Äù*

Based on the goblin giggles and paw-to-surface impacts, I think the Yotul vaulted behind the counter while feeling oh so proud of his little self.¬† *Smart boy.*

Best get out of the way so the monsters could play.

I was wiping the coffee from my eyes when something lanced into my stomach.

*‚ÄúIs this how she does it?‚Äù* mumbled the sheepdog.

Looking down, I found his paw deep in my gut.¬† He‚Äôd struck an old scar, unprotected by wool.¬† His ears and tail held an analytical expression, like he was solving a puzzle.

Even as the orange juice gushed from my gut.

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Memory transcription entity (M.T.E.): RebrA.I.:**

*‚ÄúSuch senseless violence ‚Ä¶‚Äù I sighed as I triangle choked the Ziz in the comfort of its home.¬† ‚ÄúI may have been ‚ÄòThe Smart One,‚Äô but Brkar was my moral compass, my muse, my grounding, and so much more.¬† Seeing what he‚Äôs done to his life, dragging down all the people only* ***trying*** *to do good?¬† It‚Äôs a pain I never anticipated.¬† My sweet Venbig ‚Ä¶ he always knew when I needed a hug.¬† I wish I could reach through time and cyberspace to hug him back, but I can‚Äôt.¬† However, there is one small comfort.¬† I‚Äôm glad it was* ***him*** *down there, not me, ‚Äòcause if I were put in his wool in that cold, cruel world?*¬† ***I‚Äôd burn down Skalga just to feel its warmth.****‚Äù*

1. Treasure has not yet been found. I'll post and update status every few days until/when it's found.¬†
2. Don't be naughty, or Santa will give you coal. Yes, it is buried. No, you do not need an excavator. No, do not commit crimes or destroy property. Try to exercise good judgment and respect the hard work that [SF Recreation & Parks](http://www.sfrecpark.org) does for us to enjoy the city. If you've solved the riddle, you should have pretty high conviction about where it's hidden.
3. I can't tell you what to look for, other than what we've given you via clues already.
4. We have some bonus treasure! This may be a rolling update. See website for details.¬†
5. I am so, so happy to see you guys enjoying this. Thanks to everyone who's emailed or commented a sweet note. Love that people are learning about SF's history and getting out and about. It's cool to see people making new friends and finding teammates along the way. Bringing (at least some) of the city a little closer together is the primary goal here, so thanks to you and all of our amazing treasure-makers for playing.

Any other comments or inquiries, please email me (can be found bottom of the website, AutoMod will remove this if I post here).¬†

Is This Real Life or Did I Hack the Matrix?!,"Guys... I don‚Äôt even know if I should scream, laugh, or just sit here wondering if this is real life‚Ä¶ because, SERIOUSLY, how the heck did I just make $100 IN A SINGLE DAY?!

Literally, on my phone.

Not selling kidneys, not flipping weird collectibles, not even doing surveys. Testing APPS. Apps, people! I‚Äôm still SHOCKED, so here‚Äôs the tea:

---

- I randomly stumbled on **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** while doom-scrolling at 2 AM.  
- Expected to make, what, $2 or $3 maybe? But 100 bucks?? No way.
- All I had to do? Install apps, try them out, and leave actual feedback (sometimes it felt like they genuinely wanted my opinion lol).
- No crazy skills. No code. Just my thumbs, a half-charged phone, and straight-up curiosity.

---

Day kicked off with coffee and a ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù energy so:

- Signed up super fast at **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** (seriously, 2 minutes tops).
- Picked a few apps to try: games, scheduling tools, fitness stuff‚Ä¶ even a wild plant identifier (??).
- Every review, a few dollars more. My notifications LIT UP like New Year's.

Not exaggerating, y‚Äôall. $5 here, $10 there‚Ä¶ by 5PM, I checked my balance and saw triple digits. Then refreshed because I thought it was a glitch üòÇ

---

Some things I realized SUPER quick:

- A LOT of these companies are just desperate for honest feedback!
- No, you don‚Äôt need to be a tech genius (still can‚Äôt figure out email folders tbh).
- Payments actually landed in my PayPal the next day‚Äîsmooth as butter.

---

Call me skeptical, but if you‚Äôd told me last week I‚Äôd make real money just fiddling on my phone, I‚Äôd have side-eyed you HARD.

But this is all I did:

- Grabbed the link: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**  
- Tested whatever caught my eye for a few hours while meal prepping and catching up on Netflix.
- Cashed out after making $100 for basically doing what I do EVERY day ‚Äî just scrolling and poking around apps.

Now my friends won‚Äôt stop texting me for the link. Sorry not sorry for spamming you but... this is too wild NOT to share.

---

**[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** ‚Äî THAT‚ÄôS the link.

Use it, don‚Äôt use it. Just had to shake this disbelief out and share my shock with people who get it.

Scroll for memes and AI trends all you want, but $100 days from a phone? Never thought that would be me.

Anyone else ever tried this? Am I dreaming or is this the easiest side hustle ever invented? Please, someone pinch me.

Last week was totally ordinary, UNTIL I stumbled onto **[this thing](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** that claimed I could earn money testing apps. My expectations were LOW. Honestly, I laughed at first‚Äîlike, how real could it possibly be??

But hey, a skeptical scroll is kind of my superpower, so I tried it JUST to prove it was garbage. Spoiler alert: The joke was on me.

Here‚Äôs what literally blew my mind:

- Downloaded a couple simple apps from **[this exact site](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** (don‚Äôt skip, THAT‚Äôs the sauce‚Äîno kidding)
- The apps were random: some were games, a reading app, a budgeting tool. Not sketchy at all.  
- Most tasks? ‚ÄúTry this feature‚Äù ‚ÄúRate this update‚Äù ‚ÄúSpot the bug and win extra.‚Äù
- After I filled a task, I‚Äôd submit feedback RIGHT inside the app and boom‚Ä¶ it tracked my activity.

Day one: $13 appeared in my dashboard. Like ACTUAL money. I checked three times.

Day five: Up to $59.

Day seven: Hit $103.17 total.

YOU GUYS. I made more than I do in a shift at my part-time job‚Ä¶ sitting in sweatpants??  
I have never seen a ‚Äúside hustle‚Äù that didn‚Äôt ask for stage-5-crypto-trader skills. This was JUST my phone and sometimes morning coffee.

The best hacks I found:

- Sign up at **[this link](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** and complete the little ‚Äúintro quiz‚Äù‚Äîthat unlocks better paying tests faster.
- Only grab apps with more than 3 tasks in the menu. Some single-task ones only toss you nickels.
- Pace yourself! I set reminders to NOT doom-scroll‚Äîfocus 15-20 mins, do two tasks, then rest.

I ran the payout twice‚ÄîPayPal/Stripe. Took less than 48 hours to land.

AND (the twist nobody says out loud):

- The more feedback (even just ‚Äúthis notification is dumb!‚Äù), the more ‚Äúpriority‚Äù you actually get for test invites.
- I reached out to the chat support and they actually, no joke, answered my clueless questions about ‚Äúwhy did my daily bonus disappear?‚Äù WITH a coupon code.
- My $100 wasn‚Äôt even the weekly high score. Somebody in the chat showed off $187.

Has anyone else here actually TESTED this and got paid, or did I just get lucky with **[this magical unicorn pipeline](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** ???

Legit asking because I‚Äôm now kind of hyped and completely confused as to why nobody talks about this. Tell me your stories!

Stay skeptical, but don‚Äôt sleep: **[TRY HERE if you‚Äôre feeling lucky or bored](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**. If you beat my total, let me know HOW. I need receipts üòÇ

1n7gb5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/sellmybusinessuk/comments/1n7gb5n/how_mark_sold_his_small_business_for_435000/,"How Mark sold his small business for ¬£435,000","Mark started a boutique hair salon in his twenties and ran it for 35 years. Over time, he built it into a respected local business, doing more than ¬£500,000 in sales each year and averaging about ¬£165,000 profit ‚Äî a strong 35% EBITDA margin (the profit metric buyers use when valuing companies).

On paper, it was a great business. But when Mark tried to sell, buyers either walked away or made insultingly low offers.

He decided to get help from an M&A advisor.

It was quickly identified that Mark was still the manager of the salon and personally responsible for around 25% of the sales. On top of that, his wife was handling the bookkeeping and payroll. To a buyer, the business looked far too dependent on the owners and not transferable enough.

To solve this, we promoted a manager from within the team, giving her a ¬£6,000 pay rise and gradually shifting leadership responsibilities to her. Mark also began transitioning some of his clients to other stylists. Many clients were initially reluctant, so he agreed that he would remain after the sale, on a self-employed and flexible basis, for up to two years to help transition his clients. At the same time, we reduced his hours from full-time to three days per week so the new manager could take control. 

We moved the bookkeeping and payroll from his wife to a professional bookkeeper at ¬£850 per month (¬£10,200 per year), ensuring the accounts were handled by a professional who was independent of the owner's family.

Over six months, we focused on preparing the business for sale: training the new manager, reorganising operations, and tightening up paperwork. We created high-quality sales documents so any potential buyer would see a well-structured, organised business. When we went to market, four buyers expressed interest, with two standing out. I handled the negotiations and we ultimately agreed a sale price of ¬£435,000.

Mark owned the building, we also arranged a ten-year lease at ¬£12,000 per year, giving him ongoing rental income. His post-sale role was structured to be light and flexible, allowing him to earn while gradually transitioning to a more comfortable life. Three months after due diligence began, the sale was complete. Mark walked away with a peace of mind, and confidence that the new owners would continue to grow the business.

If you‚Äôve sold a business (or tried to), I‚Äôd love to hear your story in the comments. 

There are thousands of owners like Mark who have built something valuable but don‚Äôt know how to package it properly for a buyer. If you‚Äôre thinking about selling one day and want help, just DM the admin for more info ‚Äî we‚Äôre always open to helping owners plan their exit.

And if you have a business wondering what it's worth, feel free to DM. Always happy to chat about exit strategies over a virtual coffee.",1,1756909672.0,sellmybusinessuk,0,1.0,False

I cant get my brain around how dumb this looks. why? why? why?

Every linux and unix and whatever else distro on earth could pick one of like 30 or more well known tested modern programming languages and have their compilers and installers and whatever else use those when you click the install or ./make or whatever package manager stuff.

those languages dont cost money and they use the same hardware and do the literally same things and often use THE EXACT SAME WORD FOR IT but when they call it something else because its an IMPROVED or NEW feature, you then have the option or luxury of that one, or you take the millions or billions FASTER modern code function called something for the same thing.. and run the SAME code with dictionary list of features wrapper translated ""this word oh you mean this new one here""

The same way theres not 12 different directx theres only directx and theres extra features added to the list of things directx does and the hardware is made to accelerate or assist or it was based on the hardware making it powerful enough to do that function realtime as software wasnt getting good fps to do such things.

The reason some wine or linux distros pile every directx 1 2 3 4 on top of each other in the gigabytes of wastes of time and space is like windows XP games is going to say ""supports windows XP"" and search for the OS to have version XP.. then it says Oh we have that or no we dont. But since directx and D3D is a feature list of compliance check boxes or function calls done by vulkan or microsoft or someone likely to be better at it than you and you can make your own API and function calls but for say specifically RTX lighting it takes you 2 weeks as its a few minutes or hours but weeks of testing to tweak and tune it for brightness/performance/quality and test for specific materials and details of shadows and indoors/outdoors and under water or through foliage and transparency. They give it to you with the new hardware and documentation and every windows new directx has a samples and examples or feature thing why half life and black mesa or garrys mod type games all had that certain coffee mug or specific items was its supposed to have those effects applied so the tiny file size low poly thing looks 'decently improved by turning on the function' as a showcase. See how its sorta enamel pottery look and not mspaint bitmap paint fill bucket white? round and not like a nuts and bolts?

But when you see a HARDENED linux distro or whatever, its supposed to be HALF the FILE SIZE and exponentially faster.. like way faster. But they made all the old DOS stuff to run fast on 80s and 90s computers and spent like 70 years wasting time turd polishing it so when you dont use modern language and dont use correct compilers and things its going to use like a 64bit OS in a FAT 32 file system and not be 64 or theres 32bit or 16bit dos in some part of the entire distro so the entire computer only goes as fast as 16bit dos 32bit and its usually even just the device drivers or USB legacy support. Then it doesnt fit and buffer overflows and python trouser snakes is how they have it force to keep running and pretend its a computer.

I cant get my brain around how dumb this looks. why? why? why?

So your bios has fake legacy USB and 16bit and 32bit stuff in it. So you dont own a computer ever. youve been charged for an 80s dongle. windows 11 was a hardened distro and doesnt have a system 32 folder or a heap of stuff. and.. none of that DLL nonsense. Seriously?!

I propose that you have a real file system and real bios and real OS.. with special higher bit depth fonts and file system so your entire OS has RGB rainbow fonts so you know it works with a modern gaming PC and arent installing some obsolete before it was pretended to be a thing in the 1950s turds.

His favorite victories include Mathieu‚Äôs Milan - San Remo wins and Kasia‚Äôs nail-biting 4-second TDFFAZ win, while his pick for ‚Äúbest non-win‚Äù is Mathieu and Jonas lighting up Stage 9 of the TDFFAZ. Outside of work he‚Äôs a huge coffee connoisseur, super nerdy about urban cycling infrastructure, and a proud owner of a balcony solar setup. When he‚Äôs not on the bike, you‚Äôll probably find him hiking or climbing in the Alps.

**Sven**¬†(Left) has been Product Manager for the Aeroad, Ultimate, and Inflite for the past 2 years. With a B.A. in International Management and a background in pro road cycling, he now shapes the bikes ridden by Canyon‚Äôs pros. His favorite bike is a specially tuned Aeroad for ultra-distance racing - these days less about speed, more about going long. Top highlight? MVDP‚Äôs iconic 2025 Paris - Roubaix win on the Aeroad. Off the clock, he‚Äôs all about the outdoors: bikepacking and sleeping under the stars in summer and chasing powder with the skis in winter.

This AMA is all about the¬†**engineering and product development**¬†side of things - materials, design decisions, technology, performance, portfolio, and how the team tackles challenges around the four different bikes. To keep things on track, please avoid questions on¬†**colors, customization, or stock availability**. Let's keep it positive and constructive.

Our beautiful daughter is 3 months. The last month or so has been so hard. Hell it's all been hard but the last month on my anxiety and mental health. I have diagnosed anxiety, been on Lexapro for over 10 years. Definitely not working anymore. My biggest anxiety is hypochondria. It's has focused now on my angel girl. So many things I've been scared of in the last month. The worst was i was making coffee and got coffee grounds on my hands, she cried. I picked her up to settle her. Forgot about the coffee grounds that MAY HAVE transfered thought she put her hand in her mouth and she would get caffeine poisoning. All of that was in my head because she didn't actually get coffee grounds on her hands. 

But this morning I just found my self crying for no reason. I just feel so worried about everything. She's sleeping peacefully in my arms right now. Everything is okay I have to keep reminding my self. 


In addition to this extreme anxiety, I have become a little bit resentful of my wife because it seems like she resents me. I feel my feelings don't matter to her and that I need to emotionally be there for her no matter what and I wish I was stronger for her. But I'm not right now. She is really good at emotional understanding but the other day she screamed at me ""you need help your anxiety is getting so bad"". That really hurt hearing that from her. All the time she tells me that I have the luxury of not having the burden of being the automatic one to take care of her but I tell her I want the burden. It doesn't help. She feels since she is the mom she is the default. I don't want that but things around the house still need to get done. 

Even simple things as mowing the grass, doing some house projects like landscaping she has an attitude with me because Im not giving her a break. I even ask her ""can I take a shower or will you get mad at me"" because I've taken a shower before her sometimes and I didn't consider that she hasn't showered all day. But I was mowing the lawn. I'm the main cook of the house and amongst some other responsibilities. 

I love my wife so much. But I feel like she hates me and I've said that to her but she tells me it's the hormones and I need to be more understanding. I'm trying but it's so tiring when it's hot and cold hot and cold. I feel like a failure of a husband and father. 

I just have so many feelings. And I feel society makes us bottle them up. I need to step up and be the man of this house. Which I am I'm taking care of it but God this is so hard. I need to go back to therapy I know that. Especially for my trauma and hypochondria. I know it will get better. 

Has anyone else felt similar? ",1,1756909406.0,daddit,3,0.67,False
