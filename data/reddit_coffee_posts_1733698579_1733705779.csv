We‚Äôve having some fights associated with growing pains from moving in together, and I was just looking for some advice.

Started with her saying I‚Äôm not doing anything to help around the house, and it makes her feel like I don‚Äôt prioritize her. Ignoring I did about 80% of renovations, house loan‚Äôs in my name only but we‚Äôre both on the deed, and I do 100% of lawn care, without any complaints from my side. But I put that aside and I pry out what things I can do around the house to help her out.

So I woke up early to take care of some the things she listed. When she wakes up she‚Äôs mad at me because:
1)I didn‚Äôt clean the toilets to her standard. 
2)I made a pot of coffee for us, but I did not bring up a cup to her in bed. This is just something Ive always done for her on weekends and I guess is just expected now.

It didn‚Äôt help that my college buddy made a very last minute day trip down to our place, and I wasn‚Äôt able to let her know with the fighting going on (that one was my bad).

Any advice? feels like I can‚Äôt win lol

Just a disclaimer, I love my girlfriend and I think we have a great relationship. I only included some of the details about what I do to help to show I‚Äôm not a deadbeat lol. At the end of the end these feel easy to work through issues.",2,1733705476.0,AskMenOver30,1,0.75,False

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become a popular cosmetic treatment, allowing individuals to brighten their smiles and enhance their confidence. Many people are curious about the impact of teeth whitening before and after treatment. Understanding the different methods available can help you make an informed decision and achieve the best results.

### Understanding Teeth Whitening Methods

There are several teeth whitening methods available today, ranging from over-the-counter products to professional treatments. Each method varies in effectiveness, time commitment, and cost.

- **Whitening Toothpaste:** These toothpastes contain mild abrasives and additional polishing agents to help remove surface stains. However, they typically only provide minimal whitening effects.
- **At-Home Kits:** These kits usually include whitening strips or trays filled with a bleaching gel. They offer a more significant change compared to toothpaste but require consistent use over a period of time.
- **Professional Whitening:** Conducted in a dentist's office, this method uses stronger bleaching agents to achieve faster and more dramatic results. Treatments can take just one session to brighten your teeth several shades.
- **Natural Remedies:** Some people prefer to use natural methods, such as baking soda or activated charcoal. While less effective, they can help remove minor stains without the use of chemicals.

### Comparing Before and After Results

When considering teeth whitening, understanding the potential results is crucial. Many factors influence the outcome, including the type of treatment chosen and your initial tooth shade. Here‚Äôs what you can typically expect:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** You might notice a slight change after a few weeks of consistent use ‚Äì typically one or two shades lighter.
- **At-Home Kits:** Results can vary, but many users report teeth getting 4 to 8 shades brighter after the full treatment duration, which can take several days to weeks.
- **Professional Whitening:** This method can yield impressive results, often lightening teeth up to 10 shades in just one visit. This rapid change is one of the main attractions of professional treatments.
- **Natural Remedies:** While they may improve the surface stain appearance, natural methods generally result in negligible improvement, usually just about one shade.

### Factors Affecting the Results

The results you achieve from teeth whitening depend on several factors:

- **Original Tooth Color:** Naturally darker teeth might not achieve the same level of brightness as whiter teeth.
- **Stain Type:** Teeth stained from smoking or pigmented foods often respond better to whitening treatments compared to intrinsic stains caused by aging or medication.
- **Dental Health:** Healthy teeth respond better to whitening. Those with cavities or gum disease may not get optimal results.
- **Consistency of Use:** Especially for at-home treatments, following instructions closely can greatly influence the final color.

### Monitoring Your Results

After undergoing a teeth whitening procedure, you may want to keep track of your results. Before and after photographs can help you visualize the changes. You may also consider:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- Keeping a log of your routine to note the effectiveness of the method you are using.
- Regularly evaluating your tooth shade; you can use shade guides available at pharmacies to compare.
- Consulting with your dentist if you notice any sensitivity or if results are not as expected.

### Maintaining Your Bright Smile

To prolong the benefits of teeth whitening, follow these strategies:

- **Brush and Floss Regularly:** Maintaining oral hygiene will keep stains at bay.
- **Avoid Stain-Causing Foods:** Foods like red wine, coffee, and berries can cause stains. Limit their intake to keep your smile bright.
- **Consider Touch-Up Treatments:** Depending on the method chosen, touch-up whitening every few months can help maintain brightness.

By understanding the various teeth whitening methods and their effects, you can make a more informed choice. Whether you opt for a quick professional treatment or choose a gradual at-home kit, tracking your before and after results will keep you motivated on your journey towards a brighter smile.

Common Misconceptions About Teeth Whitening Treatments and Their Effects
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become incredibly popular in recent years, with many people seeking a brighter smile. However, there are several misconceptions floating around about teeth whitening treatments and their effects. Let‚Äôs explore some of these myths to help you understand the truth behind them.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Myth 1: All Teeth Whitening Treatments Are the Same

One common misconception is that all whitening products provide the same results. In reality, there are various types of teeth whitening treatments available, ranging from over-the-counter products to professional treatments at a dental office. Each method has distinct strengths and weaknesses:

- **Over-the-Counter Products:** These include whitening strips, gels, and toothpaste. They tend to be less expensive but may take longer to show noticeable results.
- **Professional Treatments:** Conducted by a dentist, these treatments often include in-office bleaching procedures. They can yield immediate results and are generally more effective than at-home products.

### Myth 2: Whitening Treatments Damage Enamel

Many people worry that whitening treatments can harm tooth enamel. While it‚Äôs true that excessive or improper use of some products can cause issues, most reputable whitening systems are safe when used as directed. Dentists typically recommend treatments that are appropriately formulated to minimize potential risks. Additionally, regular dental check-ups can help monitor your enamel health.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Myth 3: Whitening Works on All Types of Stains

Another prevalent myth is that teeth whitening can eliminate all types of stains. However, the effectiveness of whitening treatments largely depends on the source of the discoloration:

- **Extrinsic Stains:** These are surface stains caused by food, drinks, and tobacco. They often respond well to whitening treatments.
- **Intrinsic Stains:** These arise from within the tooth and are often due to trauma or certain medications. Intrinsic stains are more challenging to treat with standard whitening procedures.

### Myth 4: After Whitening, Your Teeth Will Always Remain White

It‚Äôs important to understand that teeth can become stained again after a whitening treatment. Foods like coffee, red wine, and dark berries can contribute to new stains. To maintain your bright smile, consider these tips:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- Practice good oral hygiene.
- Limit consumption of stain-causing foods and beverages.
- Schedule follow-up whitening treatments as recommended by your dentist.

### Myth 5: Whitening Treatments Are Uncomfortable

Many people shy away from whitening treatments due to the fear of discomfort. While some individuals may experience mild sensitivity during or after treatment, this is typically temporary. Dentists often take measures to minimize discomfort, such as using special desensitizing agents. If you have concerns about sensitivity, communicate this with your dentist, who can suggest a suitable approach.

### Myth 6: You Can Whiten Your Teeth in One Session

Some individuals expect immediate results from just one whitening session. While professional treatments can deliver a noticeable difference in a single visit, optimal results often require multiple sessions, especially for those with stubborn stains. It‚Äôs essential to have realistic expectations and consult with your dentist about personalized treatment plans for the best outcome.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Myth 7: Teeth Whitening Is Unsafe During Pregnancy

Expectant mothers often worry that teeth whitening is unsafe. While there isn‚Äôt definitive evidence proving that whitening products pose a risk during pregnancy, many dentists recommend postponing cosmetic treatments until after childbirth, prioritizing the health of both the mother and child. Always discuss any treatment plans with your healthcare provider.

### In Summary

Understanding the facts about teeth whitening can help you make informed decisions. By dispelling these common misconceptions, you‚Äôll be better equipped to seek treatment that suits your needs. Whether you opt for professional services or at-home methods, knowledge is key to achieving a brighter smile safely and effectively.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Always consult your dentist for personalized advice and treatment options that align with your dental health goals.

### Conclusion

When exploring the journey of teeth whitening, the before and after images tell a powerful story. Numerous methods exist today, from professional treatments to at-home kits, each yielding its set of real results. You may find that the brightness of your smile enhances your confidence and changes how you perceive yourself. Whether it‚Äôs an important event or simply wanting to feel fresh, the noticeable difference can be astonishing.

However, it's essential to separate fact from fiction. Common misconceptions about teeth whitening treatments can cloud your judgment and lead to poor choices. For instance, many believe that all whitening procedures cause significant sensitivity or that they are equally effective for everyone. Understanding the science behind these treatments helps you make informed choices that align with your unique dental health needs.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
It's also critical to recognize that maintenance plays a key role in enjoying lasting results. Just as you would care for a new haircut or a fresh coat of paint, your newly whitened teeth require ongoing care and attention to maintain their brightness. By adopting good oral hygiene practices and avoiding foods and drinks that stain, you can keep your smile radiant long after the treatment.

Ultimately, the journey of teeth whitening holds great promise, but it's best approached with knowledge and realistic expectations. Empower yourself with information about the various options, the potential effects, and the necessary upkeep for a stunning smile. Your confidence will shine through, embodying the transformation that effective teeth whitening can bring to your life.

It's my first time posting here. I started my weight loss journey in April 2023. I'm a 34yo male (5'11"") and my starting weight was 357 lbs. I've been steadily losing weight mainly due to increased physical activities.

I started by increasing my daily steps. It was at 5k for the first month, then 7.5k for the second and now at 10k minimum ever since. I used to go on walks a lot especially when the weather permits. Around October 2023, the weather was getting a little too cold to go on walks so I picked up pickleball, badminton and squash. 

Everything was going great and I was getting better at these racket games that I started playing more. These days, I spend on average 15 hours a week playing pickleball/badminton/squash. Most days, these sessions are sufficient to reach my 10k step goal. Whenever I fell a little short, I'd go for a short walk or run an errand to reach my daily step goal.

I don't really count calories but I've been eating smaller meals. I was never a breakfast person so most days I only eat lunch and a light dinner. If I were to guess, I'm probably eating about 1600 calories a day? A typical lunch would be a stir-fry (2-3 cups of veggies, 3 eggs, \~100g of ground beef and a block of tofu) and dinner is usually something quick and cheap like a McDonald's McDouble. I drink only water, black coffee, sugar-free sports drinks. I have 2-3 beers a week.

What I'm getting confused about it I've been stuck at around 250 lbs for the past 8 weeks and I don't know what's going on. Any advice on how to get the weight loss going again?",1,1733704227.0,loseit,1,1.0,False

Conveniently, they‚Äôve used exact Flowplay assets (without Flowplay‚Äôs permission or knowledge until today) to figure out how to ‚Äúmarket‚Äù items that are neither original nor legal.
The alleged ‚Äúfounders‚Äù themselves have claimed that they‚Äôre using donations for servers. Yet, they contradict this by saying they don‚Äôt have enough funding‚Äîdespite their Patreon clearly bringing in over $745 a month. That doesn‚Äôt even include the CashApp and PayPal donations Namir has been thanking people for in their Discord. So, where is all this money going?
When asked about the bizarre floating avatars (which they clearly have the resources to fix), Namir and Zhav both responded that they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have enough funding.‚Äù They also claimed they need more money for animations‚Äîanimations they could easily get for free from sites in the meantime. Once again, this leaves us wondering: where is all this donation money really going?
Some might assume most of the money went to the artists, but that would be a mistaken assumption. Zhav and Namir admitted that they‚Äôd rather rush the project and use AI to generate avatars and game specs. So, why ask for donations in the first place?
Additionally, when asked about security protocols and user protection, both ‚Äúco-founders‚Äù seemed to lack basic understanding of cybersecurity. They‚Äôre rushing the project forward with little regard for the risks they‚Äôre posing to their potential users.
If you think a Flowplay lawsuit is bad, let‚Äôs talk about Apple. Apple doesn‚Äôt mess around when it comes to their intellectual property, and Zhav and Namir seem far more focused on pocketing donation funds than actually paying an artist to create original emojis for the game‚Äîjust like ‚ÄúOurWorld‚Äù had their own custom emojis.
Speaking of stealing, let‚Äôs not forget DoorDash. Attached is a screenshot of Zhav admitting to copying and pasting from DoorDash to create the ‚ÄúMaki Web Store‚Äù‚Äîconveniently leaving out the fact that he stole the concept and is trying to pass it off as his own work.
One interesting thing to note is Namir's role as a ""silent co-founder."" Despite insisting time and again in the chat that he is, in fact, a co-founder, he rarely defends the artists or asserts any leadership. Instead, he lets Zhav dictate the direction of the project. Namir frequently reminds players in the Discord that he's a ‚Äúfounder,‚Äù but when it comes to decision-making or standing up for the team, he takes a backseat. This raises serious questions about his actual involvement versus his desire to claim partnership while not actively contributing.
The game is already live, and you do not need to ‚Äúdonate‚Äù to play it. Zhav and Namir are simply trying to make more money from players desperate to relive their childhood memories. They claim donations have been ‚Äúshut down‚Äù for now, but they still send out weekly messages thanking people or sharing donation links, instead of saying, ‚ÄúHey, we‚Äôre not accepting donations at the moment.‚Äù Interesting‚Ä¶

1h9x2ix,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h9x2ix/my_patient_cursed_me/,My patient cursed me.,"I am a psychologist, and I work at a clinic in Los Angeles‚Äîa place that, at first glance, conveys a calm and professional atmosphere. I've been here for two years now, long enough to adapt to the routine and build good relationships with colleagues and patients. The clinic is located in an old building in the city center, with wide hallways and walls painted in neutral tones.

There were many patients, each with unique stories and deep pain. Among them, there was one case that still weighs heavily on my conscience: the suicide of a patient I was treating. It was an event that deeply marked me, but I prefer not to go into too much detail about it.

And then, there was a day that changed everything.

I was in my office, organizing some notes while waiting for my scheduled appointments. The morning had been quiet so far, and my next patient wasn‚Äôt due for another hour and a half. I took the time to review reports, but I was interrupted by the phone ringing.

***‚ÄúDoctor, are you busy?‚Äù***

***‚ÄúNot at the moment. Why?‚Äù***

***‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a young man at the reception. He seems very anxious. He insists on speaking with you.‚Äù***

***‚ÄúIs it for a session?‚Äù***

I heard the receptionist move the phone away for a moment, exchanging a few quick, muffled words with the young man. When she returned, she sounded slightly more uneasy.

***‚ÄúYes, he said it‚Äôs for a session. Should I send him up?‚Äù***

***‚ÄúSure, send him in.‚Äù***

I hung up the phone and adjusted the chair in my office. While I did take some emergency cases, it was rare for someone to show up without an appointment. That made me feel slightly uneasy, but I had no reason to refuse. Perhaps it was just another patient in urgent need of help.

After a few minutes, I heard firm footsteps in the hallway. I stood up and walked to the door, opening it to greet the young man. He was in his early twenties, perhaps, with a lost look in his eyes and labored breathing.

***‚ÄúCome in, please,‚Äù***¬†I said, trying to sound welcoming.

He stepped inside slowly, glancing at every corner of the room as if he were assessing something. He sat down in the chair across from mine but didn‚Äôt relax. His hands trembled slightly, and he seemed to be on constant alert.

***‚ÄúSo, how can I help you?‚Äù***¬†I asked, picking up my notepad.

He didn‚Äôt respond right away. Instead, he leaned forward, clasping his hands together and staring at the floor. When he finally spoke, his voice was low, almost a whisper.

***‚ÄúDo you believe in things... that can‚Äôt be explained?***

I was surprised by the question but maintained my professional demeanor.

***""Many people have experiences they consider unexplainable. Would you like to share yours with me?""***

***""It‚Äôs not a story... It‚Äôs real. Something here, right now.""***

***""Can you explain better?""***

He raised his hand and pointed to the corner of the room.

***""It‚Äôs there. Right there, watching us.""***

My heart raced, but I forced a calm smile.

***""What‚Äôs there?""***

***""Him,"" he replied, his voice disturbingly certain. His eyes didn‚Äôt blink as they fixated on the empty corner of the room.***

Instinctively, I glanced in the direction he pointed. There was nothing there but the corner lamp and some shelves filled with books.

***""Can you describe what you‚Äôre seeing?""***¬†I asked.

He tilted his head as if listening to something.

***""He‚Äôs tall, much taller than you or me. His skin is dark, and his eyes... No, they‚Äôre not eyes. They‚Äôre holes. Like portals to somewhere you should never look.""***

I swallowed hard. His words weren‚Äôt just bizarre; there was something in the way he said them that made the hair on my neck stand on end.

***""And what is he doing now?""***

He leaned forward even more, almost whispering.

***""Smiling. He‚Äôs smiling because he knows you can see him too.""***

***""I... I don‚Äôt see anything. What are you talking about exactly?""***

He let out a low laugh, almost a growl. His eyes narrowed, and his face twisted into something between pity and despair.

***""Of course, you can‚Äôt see him yet. He‚Äôs patient. He likes to play. First, he lets you feel... feel like something‚Äôs wrong, like you‚Äôre being watched.""***

My heart pounded, and I felt a cold sweat begin to trickle down my temple. I tried to steer the conversation elsewhere.

***""And you? When did you start... seeing this?""***

He gave a strange, tight-lipped smile.

***""Since I heard his name. You know what they say, don‚Äôt you? When you hear his name, it‚Äôs like an invitation. He comes in.""***

***""Name? What name?"" I asked, hesitant.***

***""Don‚Äôt say it. Don‚Äôt think it. That‚Äôs how he grows.""***

Suddenly, he stood up, and I instinctively jumped in my chair. He began pacing the room in circles.

***""He‚Äôs already here. With you. Because you asked... because now you‚Äôre thinking. He loves that. He feeds on it.""***

***""And why do you think he would follow me?""***

He stopped abruptly, turning to me with a chilling, fixed stare.

***""Because he likes those who pretend they don‚Äôt believe. And you... you‚Äôre trying to pretend, aren‚Äôt you?""***

Before I could respond, he leaned in closer, so near I could smell a metallic tinge on his breath.

***""When you turn off the lights tonight, he‚Äôll be in the corner of your bedroom. Just don‚Äôt look. If you look, he‚Äôll never leave.""***

My body went cold, but I tried to maintain a professional posture.

***""I think you might be projecting your fears,""***¬†I began, but he cut me off with a dry, bitter laugh.

""***Projections? You know nothing, doctor. But you‚Äôll learn. You‚Äôll learn the hard way.""***

He turned and headed toward the door. Before leaving, he stopped at the threshold without looking back.

***""Oh, and one more thing... He likes to whisper his name while you sleep. That‚Äôs how he wakes you up.""***

And then, he left, leaving the door open behind him. I remained seated, frozen, the echo of his words pulsing in my mind. That‚Äôs when I noticed the corner of the room seemed darker than before.

Later, after finishing my last session of the day, I sat on the office couch to gather my thoughts. I turned on the TV, hoping for some distraction while organizing a few notes.

That‚Äôs when a headline flashed across the screen:

*""Young man jumps in front of a truck in downtown Los Angeles.""*

My body froze, and the air seemed to vanish from my lungs as his image filled the screen. It was the same young man who had sat across from me just hours ago, talking about presences and whispers.

The reporter‚Äôs voice continued:

""***Witnesses say the young man appeared distressed, pacing back and forth on the sidewalk before suddenly throwing himself in front of the vehicle. He was carrying no identification but was recognized through medical records.‚Äù***

The reporter kept talking, but I didn‚Äôt want to hear more. I turned off the TV and stood up, feeling a strange weight pressing on my shoulders, as if something had been building all day. I decided I needed a break and went to the common area for a coffee with the clinic staff. Conversations there were always light, full of laughter and casual comments about the day. It helped distract me‚Äîat least for a while.

Later, I grabbed my things and headed home. Traffic was busy, as usual, and my mind felt blank, as if the day had been just another in the routine. It was strange, almost unsettling. I couldn‚Äôt quite remember the details of the morning, the conversation with the young man, or even what I felt when I saw the news. It was as if a fog had settled over my memory, erasing everything slowly.

At home, I took a hot shower and tried to unwind on the couch, watching my favorite show. My eyes grew heavy, and before I knew it, I had dozed off right there, still clutching the remote.

I woke in the middle of the night with a start. My heart was racing, though I didn‚Äôt know why. That‚Äôs when I realized: something was wrong. The room was steeped in a heavy darkness, more oppressive than usual, as if the night itself had closed in around me.

And then I heard it.

A voice, low and drawn out, right next to my ear. It was cold, almost icy, and the words were whispered with an unsettling clarity:

***""Do you remember now?""***

I jumped out of bed, a scream caught in my throat, but my feet slipped on the rug, and I hit the floor hard, slamming my elbow. Instinctively, I crawled to the corner of the room, my heart pounding as I tried to escape the suffocating sensation of being watched.

I stayed silent, staring into the darkness for what felt like an eternity‚Äîfifteen long seconds. My eyes scanned the room, searching for movement, for any sign that I wasn‚Äôt alone. But there was nothing.

And then I heard it.

A voice. Deep, drawn-out, and impossibly close, as if someone were whispering directly into my ear:

***""You know my name.""***

My entire body froze. A chill raced down my spine. It was impossible. I didn‚Äôt know the name‚Äîhow could I? Or‚Ä¶ did I?

I tried to convince myself it was just my mind playing tricks on me, but the voice came again, clearer now, almost amused:

***""You thought of it, didn‚Äôt you? That‚Äôs how it starts.""***

I looked toward the darkest corner of the room, the one that seemed deeper than it should be. The darkness there wasn‚Äôt normal‚Äîit was dense, like a void devouring the faint light around it.

***‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?*****‚Äù**¬†I called out, my voice trembling.

Silence answered me, but not for long. Something moved within the blackness, a slow, fluid motion that was almost imperceptible. Then, whatever it was took a step forward.

And I saw her.

Tall, with that twisted smile and impossible teeth, exactly as the young man had described. She stopped, tilting her head at me as if studying a fragile, frightened animal.

***""You know my name,""***¬†she said again, but this time I realized something horrifying. It wasn‚Äôt just one voice‚Äîit was a chorus, a cacophony of voices speaking in unison. Some sounded human. Others‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt.

***‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know""***¬†I screamed, desperate, pressing myself against the wall as if I could disappear into it.

Her smile widened‚Äîgrotesque, unnatural‚Äîuntil it seemed to split her face apart, revealing rows of teeth that didn‚Äôt belong to anything from this world.

***""You don‚Äôt have to say it. Just thinking is enough.""***

She began to glide toward me. Her movements weren‚Äôt natural; it was as if she was floating, her feet barely brushing the floor.

The closer she got, the colder the room became, the chill sinking into my bones. Her smile stretched impossibly wide, her eyes‚Äîif they were eyes‚Äîfixed on me with a hunger I couldn‚Äôt comprehend.

***""You‚Äôre mine now,""***¬†she hissed, her voice dragging like a knife across stone. It was followed by a laughter that didn‚Äôt come from her alone‚Äîit echoed from every corner of the room.

I couldn‚Äôt move. I wanted to scream, to run, to fight‚Äîbut my body refused to respond, as if I had been swallowed whole by a nightmare.

She leaned in closer, her face now so near that I could feel an icy cold emanating from her.

\*""\****Don‚Äôt fight it. It‚Äôs better when you accept.""***

And I did.

I accepted Vojidjavmo into my life. At first, I resisted, I fought‚Äîbut no matter how hard you try to run, she always finds a way back in. When I finally stopped fighting, everything changed. There was no more fear, no more pain. Only a feeling‚Ä¶ indescribable. It‚Äôs the best thing I‚Äôve ever felt.

Now, I see the world as it truly is, with all its dark secrets and whispered truths. Vojidjavmo showed me everything. She gave me freedom, power, and a purpose I never knew existed.

And now, you know her name too. That‚Äôs all she needs. Just the sound of it, or even the thought, is enough to open a door.

Don‚Äôt try to ignore this. Don‚Äôt try to forget her. The more you try, the stronger she becomes.

Look at the darkest corner of your home. It doesn‚Äôt have to be now‚Äîit can be later, when you‚Äôre alone, and the silence begins to weigh on you. But be careful: once you see her, she will never leave.

She‚Äôs waiting.

I love you Vojidjavmo.",2,1733703835.0,nosleep,0,0.75,False

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I‚Äôm looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I‚Äôm not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I‚Äôm very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific ‚Äútype‚Äù of person! I‚Äôm looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I‚Äôm not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn‚Äôt?) - I‚Äôm definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I‚Äôm a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I‚Äôm very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you‚Äôd be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I‚Äôve mentioned in my post, it‚Äôs up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on ‚Äúhey‚Äù or smalltalk responses.

And most surprisingly good destinations,"Disappointing- Bohol & Cebu. I don‚Äôt understand the hype. The beaches are mid tier. I even went to Malapascua and Moalboal and the beaches were rocky. Bantayan had the only decent beaches in the entire province. Mainland Cebu has no nice beaches. The only thing worth seeing in Cebu is the canyoneering, but that‚Äôs only for adventurous types. It‚Äôs not a relaxing experience. 

Bohol‚Äôs beaches were full of seaweed, and the Chocolate Hills are just ok. The type of thing that‚Äôs cool for 5 minutes and you never want to see again. There are much more beautiful mountain lookouts all over the Philippines. Chocolate Hills may be unique but they‚Äôre not that impressive. 

Siargao- what‚Äôs there to do? Swimming in jagged rock pools. An overlook looking at a field of coconut trees (in a country with millions of coconut trees). A rope swing into a murky river that looks like any other river in the Philippines. Plus you have the wannabe Bali culture without any actual local culture. It‚Äôs just coffee shops and yoga. That‚Äôs not local culture. 

Surprisingly good- Camiguin. The locals actually take care of their island. It‚Äôs clean. There are no good mainland beaches (because they‚Äôre volcanic sand and look like dirt), but a really quick boat ride to Mantigue and White Island will take you to some of the most beautiful beaches in the country. Plus the mainland has waterfalls and warm and cold springs you can swim in. The tourist attractions are well-maintained, organized, and not overcrowded.

Need a coffee shop that's close to chain coffee places. 24hr access to room service menu? If I'm being honest we'll probably hang around a quiet pool, a beach day but I really like the idea of being brought food all day whether its at the beach, pool, room. Is this how this stuff works at an AI?

We want privacy, quiet, a decent beach. We already live on the gulf so its not the most important thing to us. We're more looking for an amazing view

Budgeting at $3000-$3500USD or lower depending on bang for buck. This is including the flight, but it's out of Tampa so flights aren't crazy expensive. Originally we were set on Excellence Playa Mujeres, thought about the new one Coral, little pricey so also considering Excellence Riviera Cancun. We aren't set on Cancun or Excellence just have read some dicey things of anything outside of Mexico

I've read enough threads that I should've been able to answer all of this myself but I just can't but I find that more often than not the answers to my questions are 5 years old and pre vs post covid is a huge difference.

Thank you for your help you're all amazing!",2,1733703093.0,AllInclusiveResorts,4,1.0,False
1h9wt0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1h9wt0r/is_this_a_crash_diet_am_i_setting_myself_up_for/,Is this a crash diet? Am I setting myself up for failure?,"
TLDR; would you consider 2 protein shakes per day, unlimited fruits and veggies, and an 800-900 calorie high protein meal per day a ‚Äúcrash diet‚Äù?

So for context/ background: I‚Äôm obese. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù, f27, 265lbs. 3 years ago I lost 30 pounds and have slowly regained 10 back, and I‚Äôm not interested in gaining any more. I want to have a second child but don‚Äôt feel comfortable doing that until I‚Äôm closer to 200lbs due to obesity related complications when I had my first child. I also want to preserve my mobility and health for my child(ren). I have no weight related health problems right now, but I‚Äôm 27. I know it‚Äôs only a matter of time before T2D, blood pressure, heart disease, etc are an issue. 

When I lost weight before, making it as easy as possible by eating the same things every day worked really well for me. I generally had a protein coffee with a fairlife shake for breakfast every day, a turkey sandwich and veggies for lunch, and then ate what I wanted for dinner. I‚Äôm busier now than I was at that point and but want to get back to losing weight am looking to simplify it even further. 

Basically, I want to drink 2 protein shakes per day, allow myself whatever fruits and veggies I want (w/o dips, sauces, etc obviously), and then eat a bigger meal at dinner because I know that backloading my calories at night has worked for me in the past. 

This feels balanced to me. When I put this into MFP to see what the calories and macros are‚Äî using a dinner that‚Äôs about half of the daily calories, and for the daytime 2 scoops of ghost with 1c 2% milk each, 2 fruits, and 2 large servings of vegetables‚Äî it‚Äôs around 1800 calories and fits my target macros nicely. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll even be hungry honestly, since I don‚Äôt eat the bulk of my calories during the day even when I‚Äôm not trying to lose weight.   

Anyways, I was talking to a friend about my plan and she said it was a crash diet and said I should ‚Äújust focus on eating clean‚Äù. To me though, I‚Äôm just having  2 meals with a quick source of protein that I already know I like, keeps me full, and reduces my cravings. It seems no different to me than eating the same packed lunch every day, which plenty of people do. But I can‚Äôt stop thinking about her comment and wondering if I‚Äôm setting myself up for failure, or modeling an unhealthy lifestyle to my daughter (although I guess im already modeling an unhealthy lifestyle being obese). 

I guess im just looking for reassurance/ validation that this isn‚Äôt a crash diet and that im not setting myself up for failure. ",9,1733703048.0,loseit,14,0.91,False

My father was homeless at points, and my mother is mentally ill and has caused me great trauma (CSA), and so I generally try to be sympathetic to the homeless, keeping my headphones on but smiling at them if I make eye contact. Today when I was passing this man, he caught my eye, and so I smiled at him in what I think was a friendly manner but kept walking. He said something to me and started walking after me, which is common, people often ask for money, and so I took my headphones off, prepared to say something like ""Sorry, all I got on me is my EBT card"", or something to that effect (more or less true I grew up poor and am presently not making very much money, my life is funded by scholarships and financial aid), but he didn't ask for money, instead he said ""The fuck did you say to me?"" at this point, I had one ear off of my headphone to hear what he was saying, and so I said ""I'm sorry?"" since I was confused, at which point he punched at me. I flinched, and so his fist didn't touch my face, but if I didn't react he would have punched me in the face. I walked away, and looked back often, he was following after me at first, but eventually stopped.

  
I continued walking, and struggled to decide whether or not to call the cops. Since he was white and just punching at random people, I decided that (although being mentally ill puts him at risk for being murdered) he had a lower chance of being victim of police brutality, so I called the police and told them what happened. The dispatcher said she thinks she knows who I'm talking about, and would send cops to look for him, and as I was walking through downtown I saw more cop cars then usual driving down the two streets. I walked into a bagel shop where I was planning to get my bagel, but there was a long line so I left after like 10 minutes. When I walked out of the bagel shop and down the road towards where I was gonna get coffee, he was in front of me!

So because this man was in front of me, I stopped walking to give him more space (he was like six feet away), and at this point he turned around and said ""I'm coming back for you!"" then kept walking. I crossed to the other side of the street, and when I looked across the street at him he was frequently looking in my direction. I felt like somewhat of a class traitor for calling the police, but didn't actually see if they talked to him since he was wearing different clothes than what I said. 

I thought I was unaffected, but when I was studying just now I started to think about this incident in a way similar to when I have disassosciative flashbacks to my experience of being CSAd, although in a less intense way, but still generating anxiety and distracting me. I'm posting now because I'm worried, and also somewhat sad, that whereas before things like this would happen all the time and I'd think nothing of it, now I'm sitting here in a little college library stressed about being punched at, not even punched. But also mildly frightened at going outside, since this is a homeless man who lives in the downtown area, and apparently has it out for me. ",1,1733703021.0,CPTSD,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôve found ok to be used on errands and non fancy events not sure if it‚Äôs ok for work, just not a fan of the metal strap not being detachable. It does fulfill my Loewe & Bottega fantasy a bit.

I added two new to me bags which I got for very cheap, I‚Äôm excited to carry the vachetta lee radziwill to work (I think it fits a laptop)

My life is gym, get coffee with friends in lounge-like clothes, and go to work. Sometimes go to special events but pretty rare. The bags with the hearts are my forever bags, honestly I can just live with those 3 but would like just one super stiff bag. 

If I add another bag to my collection maybe it will be to celebrate a life milestone so I‚Äôm not quick to make a purchase. If I do come across a good deal for a TB OG Lee Radziwill I would swipe it up. I did own the medium size which I recently got rid of because I found it hard to use due to the size, but the small is more workable I can pair it with another bag.

Yes, some cafe admiration while having a coffee with the wife, some back country spirited driving that afternoon. Cornering, handling, speed and sound but straight line speed isn't the main factor as my Tesla is quick enough (albeit, boring).

Hey language lovers! As an Italian tutor, I've had my share of eyebrow-raising moments hearing students grapple with *insomma*. It‚Äôs one of those words that‚Äôs like a Swiss army knife‚Äî**supremely versatile**. But let's dive in and break it down.

**So, what does ""insomma"" mean?**

In my experience, students first meet *insomma* in the wild, usually during heated conversations about one too many chocolate croissants. Suddenly, they're sucked in by its charisma! Imagine saying 'in short,' 'well,' or even 'not too bad,' all wrapped into one.

**Wrapping up with ""insomma""**

Picture this: You‚Äôve banged on about gym workouts and say, *Insomma*, it was exhausting! A one-word summary! 

**The impatient wait with ""insomma""**

Standing in line for gelato with your pals, and someone asks, *Insomma, are you getting chocolate or pistachio?* It's that exasperated nudge to make a decision‚Äîpriceless!

**When you're ""meh"" with ""insomma""**

If your cousin asks about a date that didn‚Äôt quite sparkle, shrug and say, *Insomma!*, as if sipping lukewarm coffee.

**The exasperated ""insomma""**

As your buddy recounts his failed souffl√© attempt‚Äîfor the fourth time! *Ma insomma*, get a new recipe already!

Around the time the chest pains and swallowing issues started, I told my PCP and she sent me to a GI. I got an upper endoscopy and the doc said I looked great, he saw no issues. He prescribed me OME to help my symptoms. Despite taking these regularly, I continued to develop symptoms, again culminating in really bad heartburn and vomiting.

Long story short, I got my start in roleplaying back during the golden age of AOL and Yahoo (anyone else remember the Red Dragon Inn back in the late 90s and early 2000s?). Ah, those were the days, right? When the biggest worry was your dial-up connection, haha.

As I'm sure you'd all agree‚Äîfinding long-term, advanced/literate writers is much more challenging these days. I have fond memories of when the process of coming up with a plot was an organic process; where you'd genuinely take the time to get to know the other person, build rapport, and allow a plot to form naturally.

That's what I'm hoping to find. With that said, I put a lot of effort into this post, so hopefully there's someone else out there who values the same things in a writing partner!

**First of all, here's a bit about me as a person:**

* I'm 30+, male, and I've written several novels and a bunch of articles, mostly in historical fiction and contemporary stories. Writing isn't just my job; it's pretty much a part of who I am.
* I'm always trying to learn something new, whether it's from books, documentaries, or just good old chatting. History and cultures fascinate me the most.
* When I'm not buried in books or work, I love to hike and take photos. There‚Äôs something about being out in nature that just clears my head.
* I love to read (especially non-fiction and historical fiction). I'm always down for swapping book recommendations, if you're also a reader!
* I love peanut butter (crunchy over smooth any day ‚Äì fight me).
* On that note, if I'm being honest, coffee isn't just a drink for me; it's a ritual!
* I'm a big fan of the simple things in life. Give me a sunset, a good laugh, or a perfect slice of pizza, and I‚Äôm set.
* I love diving into those deep, meandering conversations that start with ""what if"" and end somewhere between ""the meaning of life"" and ""why can‚Äôt we tickle ourselves?""
* Fun fact: I used to be able to recite all 50 states in alphabetical order ‚Äî a party trick born out of a grade school challenge, haha.

**Here's what I'm looking for in a writer:**

* ***Writing Style -*** I'm looking for a partner who has a strong command of the English language. I'm talking about descriptive passages that paint clear pictures, dialogue that is crisp, concise, and not overly flowery. I prefer to write in the 3rd person, past tense. I prefer modern fiction and historical fiction stories.
* ***Communication -***  Life's unpredictable! What‚Äôs important is keeping each other in the loop about our schedules and any changes in the story or our approach. A quick heads-up can make a huge difference. It's all about being honest and direct with our feedback and thoughts.
* ***Long-Term Plots -*** I'm really looking for a writing partner who's in it for the long haul and is passionate about crafting intricate, plot-driven stories. For me, the joy of roleplaying lies in developing a story that evolves over time, with twists and turns that keep us both engaged and inspired.
* ***Sense of Humor -*** Writing together should be fun and relaxed, not just a serious crafting of narratives. It‚Äôs important to me that we can both throw in a bit of humor now and then, not only in our stories but in our interactions too.

And there you have it! If you're a detail-oriented, communicative, mature, and long-term story lover, you might just be the writing partner I'm looking for.

We should totally write such a good story that our keyboards will need a vacation after we're done, haha. I hope to hear from you!",2,1733702190.0,Roleplay,0,1.0,False

Right before thanksgiving i confronted them again on a weeknight because the music was loud enough to knock things off my wall and shelves including my dead gramma who I had to scoop up, it was vibrating my floor and walls to the point it was making my coffee table rattle. So I went down and asked them nicely to turn it down a bit to which they said ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt give a fuck about get back from my door or I‚Äôll fuck you up‚Äô to which I left and called the cops but by the time they got there the music was turned down so they didn‚Äôt do anything. 

I made two other noise complaints this week and have talked to the apartment manager and nothing has been done. Last night it was loud enough to shake my home again so I went down to ask again then it escalated to us yelling at eachother and one of the people getting in my face, they pretended to hit me but one of the times clipped my nose (I was back against a wall) I don‚Äôt think they knew I was recording so I have a video of me screaming ‚Äòdon‚Äôt fucking touch do not touch me‚Äô at them and just the whole conversation which they cornered me, called me names, screamed at me etc etc.

Is it normal to request something liek this, I just want to be sat near to someone and feel seen and valued. I've been single for the last 4 years and haven't been ""intimate"" with anyone in about 18 months, although we never really cuddled but we did have a kiss one time.

So the advice I'm after, what is visiting a prostitute like? how did it make you feel and how did you go about discussing your wants/needs/desires?

Someone correctly posted the coffee shop in the background of the picture of Hannah and Alan smiling together that was on his Instagram is the Momona Bakery and Coffee Shop. It is owned by three women in Hawaii from Argentina; Sofia Prassolo, Lucia Sabbione, and Silvana Larcher. Silvana owns a boutique with swimwear and jewelry called To the Moon and Back. Lucia is featured the most on the Instagram pictures for the shop, but it also has pictures of Mariana (or Marianna). The photographer for Mariana‚Äôs pictures on the To the Moon and Back Instagram is Martin Caprille, who is also from Argentina, and is married to Milagros Noel. If you Google Mariana‚Äôs deleted Instagram @marulialba, then you can find the swimsuit pictures.

Mariana‚Äôs picture on the shop‚Äôs Instagram are from May of 2023. So, we know she was in Maui at least then.

We‚Äôre currently in a long distance relationship until she moves here next year.

The main point of contention we have in our relationship is the amount of time we spend together.

On a typical day we‚Äôll spend a few hours together on the phone, chat about our day, life, plans, etc. The problem arises towards the end of our evenings. I work a very high stress job from home and like to get out for an hour or two a day to break the monotony. This could be something along the lines of meeting up with friends, grabbing a coffee, wrapping up my workday elsewhere, etc. She doesn‚Äôt understand why this is something that I view as necessary and it‚Äôs what I use to destress, reset, etc. As a result of this, things have spiraled to the point where she will not engage in conversation while I am out. I have told her multiple times that she can message me, reach out, etc. and I‚Äôll get back to her despite whatever is going on, on my end.

So that we can talk and spend time with each other I‚Äôve gone as far as shifting meetings around during the workday, putting in extra hours during the late evenings so that we can talk during the day, and even working on the weekends to make up for work I‚Äôm behind on. I even keep her on call during the work day as much as I can despite it being difficult to multitask. I do these things because I truly love her and care for her, I know long distance relationships can be difficult.

Recently I‚Äôve been working 60+ hours a week over the past couple of weeks so that I can wrap up a big work project so that I can see her in person. Things came to a head last week when she told me she‚Äôd like me to be around in the evenings and be home, I communicated that I need some time to myself in the evenings to reset specially because of the recent work schedule. After she told me this, over the course of the week our communication had been terse. Given my work schedule, I didn‚Äôt have the mental capacity to address this. So we had brief conversations throughout the course of the week and I made no mention of being home in the evenings.

The past weekend she blew up at me and told me that what I am doing the bare minimum in a relationship, I don‚Äôt deserve to be with her, etc. This was due to me not being home during the evenings. Her friends think that I should be spending time with her on the phone to destress, family is supposed to help destress, etc. I‚Äôve told my wife before that if we have something preplanned, or have agreed to spend the evening together before hand then I can be home and we can spend that time together. However, if that‚Äôs not the case then I don‚Äôt want to be home for no reason. To include some more context, recently my wife hasn‚Äôt been doing well mentally so that is something that could be contributing to this. I understand that she is going through a tough time and I want to do whatever I can to support her. I‚Äôm just trying to afloat on my end as well as things have been very stressful recently.

I‚Äôm at my wits end because I think that I might be missing my wife‚Äôs perspective. I‚Äôve encouraged her to take some time for herself everyday too, go out, hang out with friends, etc. At this point, I guess I‚Äôd appreciate the perspectives of others. I don‚Äôt understand why it is a big deal to be out for a while to destress.

‚Ä¢	I love nature, and I‚Äôm planning a big road trip next year to explore national parks across the U.S. with my dog, Luna (she‚Äôs an ESA and my travel buddy).  
  
‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm also into fitness, mental wellness, and continuously working on being a better version of myself.  
  
‚Ä¢	I enjoy going out for drinks and hitting up bars occasionally, but I‚Äôm more interested in good company and meaningful conversations than wild nights out.  
  
‚Ä¢	I enjoy playing video games to unwind, mainly co-op games with people, I‚Äôm always down to play.

I‚Äôm looking to connect with people who value meaningful conversations, self-improvement, and maybe share some similar interests. Whether you‚Äôre down to grab a coffee, explore the city, or just chill and talk about life, I‚Äôm open to it.

I added a bottomless portafilter and WDT to help me understand puck prep, but ultimately I could never make great tasting espresso due to a number of factors with that setup. I‚Äôve added too much sugar to my drinks every day to make it a bit bearable.

Finally we‚Äôre in a great spot financially and WLL had some great pre Black Friday deals I couldn‚Äôt pass up. I‚Äôve been eyeing the ECM Mechanika slim PID and Eurka Mignon Oro for a while, but pretty much no countertop space.

‚ñ™Ô∏éCivet by Zoologist‚ñ™Ô∏é
Top Notes:¬†Bergamot, Black Pepper, Lemon, Orange, Spices, Tarragon
Heart Notes:¬†Carnation, Frangipani, Heliotrope, Hyacinth, Linden-blossom, Tuberose, Ylang
Base Notes:¬†Balsams, Civet*, Coffee, Incense, Labdanum, Musks*, Oakmoss, Resins, Russian Leather*, Vanilla, Vetiver, Woods

I was scared to try this perfume honestly. Most of the reviews said this was very animalistic and musky which I didn't have much of a reference for. I was scared for nothing, I adore it. I've only worn it once so far, but I'm thinking of buying the travel spray cause it's simply not in the budget to FS this. This seems like the perfect winter scent to me. It's very dark and warm. I can smell the citrus, mainly the lemon. Even though I can pick out the lemon it's not the normal brightness that goes with citrus smells. About ninety seconds after I sprayed it on my skin I smelled almost exclusively amber but after a little while longer it mellowed out into something complex and so intoxicating. I sprayed it on a piece of paper three days ago and I can still smell it, I assumed that meant the longevity would last but I was disappointed. I have a small bottle of Le Labo Iris 39 and it's an Eau de Parfum, it lasts all day on me and sometimes I can still smell it two days later. I though because Civet was and Extrait de Parfum, it would have similar if not better longevity. I think it only ended up lasting like 5ish hours, which is pretty good. It lasted about half my work day, I just was disappointed about the longevity compared to my Le Labo perfume. I will preface this by saying I didn't prep my skin at all before applying. That said I also never prepped my skin for the Le Labk perfume either.

‚ñ™Ô∏éCow by Zoologist‚ñ™Ô∏é
Top Notes:¬†Sage, Apple
Heart Notes:¬†Milk, Lily of the Valley, Heliotrope, Violet, Jasmine
Base Notes:¬†Cedarwood, Vetiver, Benzoin, Musks*, Amber

This one is not for me. I pretty much only smelled the sage both when it was on my skin and on paper. On my skin I got a hint of violet, but it was basically just straight sage. I don't really like the smell of sage. I don't know what kind of sage it was, but it wasn't culinary sage or California white sage which I know the smell of. Besides the smell of sage this perfume was very green, I didn't get any of the milk note and not nearly as much of the florals as I was hoping for. This perfume was not at all what I thought it was going to smell like.

‚ñ™Ô∏éDamned Nightfall rollerball oil by Death & Floral‚ñ™Ô∏é
The deepest and darkest amber blended with violets, black labdanum, vanilla absolute, espresso absolute, fresh cocoa beans, and honey

The smell of this is really faint to me. I think I can smell the violets when I first put it on, there is definitely the smell of something I find pleasant I just don't know what to attribute it to. I can smell the espresso and the dry down is a very realistic honey smell which I love. I wish this was stronger. I can only smell it on my skin for about an hour. I like it, I don't love it. Pretty sure I won't be getting it again.

‚ñ™Ô∏éThe blues are all the same rollerball oil by Death & Floral‚ñ™Ô∏é
Smooth vanilla cognac, aged barrel wood, and sticky honey.

This one is the strongest of the D&F perfumes that I got. After a few days of resting it smells more like chocolate to me than anything even if that isn't a note in it. I think what I'm smelling if supposed to be the cognac note. I can say it doesn't smell like any cognac I've smelled before, but I enjoy the scent. To me this kind smells like something I'd get at Bath & Body works except a little elevated. I get a little of the vanilla as well. This scent to me is a little more gourmand than I prefer, but it seems like it will make a good winter scent when it starts raining here.
*After 10ish days of resting it's so warm and cozy. I get a lot of the vanilla, but in the most comforting way. I think the honey and vanilla stand out to me and this will definitely be a go to in the coming months.

‚ñ™Ô∏éThe deadly poppy field by Death & Floral rollerball oil‚ñ™Ô∏é
Green & watery flowers, soaked earth, lily-of-the-valley, slightly sweet red poppies, the sweet lingering of a memory

I really enjoy this watery floral scent. I don't know how you can create a scent that smells distinctly watery, but I can really smell it in this perfume. I wouldn't call this scent petrichor, but it does smell like a flower covered in dew. I'll probably start wearing this more in Spring, but it is my favorite of the D&F scents I've smelled so far.

‚ñ™Ô∏éQueen of Moths by Death & Floral rollerball oil‚ñ™Ô∏é
Incense, rich chocolate, decaying flowers, tobacco, dark woods, attic dust

I don't get tobacco scent from this perfume, but it is a very Gothic scent to me. I mostly smell Incense and the attic dust. It seems like a good scent to wear in Fall/winter maybe layered with a pine forward scent. I like it, I think I need to wear it a few more times before I'm sure where it fits for me.

I‚Äôm a FTM to my little guy who is 6 months old.

I don‚Äôt have many friends in the city I live, most are back home across the country. Also no family here and I‚Äôm a SAHM.

I‚Äôd say outside of grocery store workers and people of that nature, my baby only sees and interacts with my husband and I.

He interacts with someone outside of the two of perhaps at a rate of once every 2-4 weeks. I‚Äôm stating to worry this isn‚Äôt enough socialization for him with other humans. First off, am I overthinking this? He doesn‚Äôt seem scared or nervous around other people, and I know he‚Äôs still young.

Second, where could I bring him that he/we might run into other babies he could interact with? I have no friends with children, no matter the city. I‚Äôd even take him interacting with adults at this point. Anyone that isn‚Äôt me or his dad.

I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôs hurting his socialization - is he too young to be stressing about this or am I right on time?

Currently I take him on two long walks, one in the morning and one in the evening. I also try to go at least one place outside the home every day. Whether that be grocery shopping, errands, coffee shop, anywhere that isn‚Äôt our home.

I am currently pregnant with my first baby. I am in a same sex relationship and have used a donor to start our family. Since we announced that we are expecting a child together my sister has been saying and doing increasingly problematic things.

She keeps emphasising that the child is not genetically my partners and how she will be a closer relative to the baby than my partner. Telling me that I don‚Äôt understand how it‚Äôs going to be when I have the baby because in heterosexual relationships men know their role but my partner won‚Äôt. 

She has always been rude to my partner generally but it has really ramped up lately. We were supposed to meet for an event this weekend and she left us both waiting for over 2 hours outdoors in the freezing cold for her, her husband and children to arrive. We missed most of the event and when she arrived she behaved like it was our fault she couldn‚Äôt find her way there and had also stopped to get herself food and coffee before meeting us knowing how late she was, and there was food being served at the event. I would have just left when it hit the 2 hour mark but I stayed for my nephews I didn‚Äôt want to disappoint them. 

We got through what was left of the event but it was quite uncomfortable overall. As we went to go our separate ways home, she added that she is hosting dinner over Xmas at her house and asked if we could make it, and would invite my brother too. When asked about dates my partner mentioned she would need to work a couple of days over Xmas and my sister responded oh that‚Äôs fine then you can come alone. I just said I‚Äôd see, but honestly I‚Äôve no interest in spending time at her house, particularly given her attitude to my partner. 

Additionally given I am managing diabetes with this pregnancy I don‚Äôt want to have a day where I leave when I eat up to her given she was fine to leave me waiting so long today. I also don‚Äôt drive so would be relying on her picking me up and dropping me home as public transport is limited between where we live on the Xmas dates. 

Tl;dr my sister is rude to my partner, and has an attitude that is borderline or possibly out front homophobic and I don‚Äôt really know what to do. ",0,1733700109.0,relationships,0,0.5,False
1h9vsgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1h9vsgg/50_states_recap_honolulu/,50 states recap - Honolulu,"This all started when a guy I found annoyingly competitive in college challenged me to a marathon in Bermuda. I now know that Bermuda isn‚Äôt one of the 50 states and that was a big waste of time.

When I was a freshman in college, my parents wanted to support this quest of mine and they said that if I paid for my race entry fees (dozens of dollars), they‚Äôd pay for everything else (thousands of dollars, second mortgage type dollars). 

So I‚Äôm in Alaska. State number 5. 

I landed on the east coast from my Chinese study abroad, didn‚Äôt have time to get over jet lag, and on a 5 hour connecting flight from Minnesota, realized how freaking far away Alaska is to only spend 24 hours there to go for a jog.

Then, poof, Vegas. The MGM grand was the only hotel on the strip that let 20 year old me stay there. I didn‚Äôt drink, didn‚Äôt gamble, but still, the youngest son flying off to Sin City was not what the preacher parent pair particularly presumed when they made their initial offer.

What are the best stories from marathons?

I was wearing a tank top and shorts when I got hailed on in New Jersey, which is the only state I failed twice. The hail was my third time lucky charm. I‚Äôve stopped and quit in the middle twice (obviously damn New Jersey was one, but also PA). Finished over my time goal, ie blew it, seven other times. Spent over a full week (something like 180 hours) of my life actively running marathons. Spent 15 years traveling, training, and getting injured. 

Never done a marathon on a treadmill, though I think I‚Äôd still count it. I have done point A to point B as you‚Äôd expect. Also a 26 mile loop and 2 13 mile loops. The weird ones? How about 6 loops of ~4, 12 loops of ~2, 16 loops of ~1.5, 26 loops of 1, and 130 loops of 0.2 indoors? Yea Connecticut in January around a hockey arena. At least it was flat.

Minnesota got postponed during the race due to thunderstorms and then re-opened, but I just kept running. I always just kept running. I did a trail series where the marathon was the shortest distance offered and people basically scoffed at me out of pity when I told them which race I was doing. Like the kids fun run or something. Most people there were running for 24 hours. I finished, drove home, napped, poured a Manhattan in front of the fire, had dinner, slept for the night. Woke up, had coffee, did the crosswords, and those lunatics still hadn‚Äôt finished. Barbarians.

I drove to 17 of the states, pays to live on the east coast. Combined two marathons with new state high points: Wisconsin and Iowa. I did what I consider the big 4: Boston, Chicago, NYC, and CIM, but I prefer the smaller races. I‚Äôd trade easier logistics in lieu of crowd support every time.

I got lost in Alabama and ran roughly an extra mile. I blindly followed two people in front of me and we‚Äôre suddenly weaving through oncoming traffic. Not the adrenaline I hoped for. The irony is that it was on lap 2 of a 2-loop course, so yea we had already not gotten lost the first time around.

In Wyoming, I stole four copies of the Jackson Hole Newspaper when my daughter and I made the front page while the race‚Äôs winner was in the corner of page four. Being a dad with a cute three year old is much cooler than being fast.

I‚Äôm looking forward to when that is no longer my favorite picture.

My best race ever? I came in something like 325th overall, and got a very impressive 76th in my age group. I‚Äôve run three marathons on Thursdays for some strange reason. Also done a Monday but never Tuesday, Wednesday, or Friday. I‚Äôve done marathons in 20 of the locations mentioned in Johnny Cash‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôve Been Everywhere.‚Äù 

My sister was in Honolulu today doing her first marathon as a Mrs but really her 8th - all in different states. She‚Äôs my go-to when I can tell I‚Äôve overshared about jogging with my partner. She‚Äôs been hearing from me about Honolulu‚Äôs heat for months now. My sister‚Äôs done 5 different states with me including easternmost Maine and southernmost / westernmost Hawaii. She‚Äôs also done 2 north of Toronto. 8 states knocked off is getting dangerously close to being pot committed to all 50. She‚Äôs the least insane Jones child, so who knows if she ends up doing the other 42, and having kids might change her plans‚Ä¶ in either direction. 

My brother-in-law has now been to one more of my marathons than my actual brother. Awkward.

The first state I signed up for was Massachusetts, yea that one. My dad took us all to watch the Orioles lose to the Red Sox in Fenway on a Sunday in April. In Utah, he got to see more of Salt Lake City and its residents than he expected when we turned into the pride day parade. From town parks in Minnesota to river walks in South Dakota, he‚Äôs handed me more bags of ice and frozen Gatorades than anyone else.

My mom was there at the beginning, driving me to her hometown Virginia Beach for the first state back in 2009. I signed up for Virginia a few weeks before on a whim and crushed it. Back then, the 50 states sounded easy, almost just a check the box exercise. Getting knee surgery three months later proved how wrong I was. It was a taste of how long and hard it would end up being. That‚Äôs what she said.

When I met my partner, I had only done 19 states. I don‚Äôt think she realized how constant a presence the final 31 states would be in our lives over the next 10 years. If I knew how annoying it would be, I never would‚Äôve started. She says to herself, ya know, it‚Äôs ok to disappoint the 18-year-old version of yourself. But we agree to disagree. Though we do agree that my teenage self was a dickhead for more reasons than just this stupid challenge.

My two daughters have definitely had to put up with a lot over the past five years for me to finish the final 17 states. Endless stroller jogs up and down our road, snack cups, iPad Netflix, a truly wonderful number of naps. Even giving some free time for Mama to sneak in a cup of tea or perhaps her weekly shower. Single stroller, double stroller, hats, gloves, blankets, and of course, sunburn. How many dogs will we see this time? Will we see any deer? Birdies? Squirrels?

My older daughter went from being a sleeping snuggled potato to meticulously keeping track of animals in a notebook, all in that same stroller, all on easy jogs in New York. My adopted state. State number three. Three out of‚Ä¶ three out of what‚Äôs now all Fifty.

All fucking Fifty.

1h9voal,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1h9voal/best_friend_is_controlling/,best friend is controlling ,"Hi everybody, my (22f) best friend (22f) is extremely controlling. She has admitted to struggling with boundaries, jealousy and comparing herself to others which I understand. However, sometimes she takes this out on me and I genuinely struggle to be on the same page as her. A few weeks ago, she organised a dinner and one of her friends who lives 3 hours away from us didn‚Äôt come. She was very disappointed, but I didn‚Äôt really understand why. It was in the middle of a snowstorm and her friend has never been to our city. For Christmas, she is organising another dinner. I unfortunately have to work that night (I am an agent for a musician and my client has been offered a great opportunity which I have known about longer than her dinner), and she completely blew up when I told her. Telling me that my decision was not good enough and that I have disappointed her. I knew about my client‚Äôs upcoming opportunity for over a year, but only realised it was the same night as her dinner recently. I told her that I could take her out for coffee during the day, but she insists she will be spending the entire day preparing for her dinner. The last thing she said to me was that she cannot believe that I am acting like this is nothing and that I was gaslighting her because I told her that she would have a great night with everyone else (I genuinely meant it and she interpreted it as me saying she has no other friends). I offered to call up after my client finishes his appointment, but she insisted that her dinner would be over then. This is not the first time this has happened. I appreciate being treated like family and being included in everything; although my division between family and friends is slightly different. When I graduated, my parents were the only one that celebrated with me. Whereas when she graduated, I had to spend the day with her mam and dad and her. I‚Äôm conscious of the fact I‚Äôm being mean, but my friend‚Äôs jealousy has become more and more apparent. Recently, she was seeing a horrible person (24 nb) that I think genuinely destroyed their self-confidence and ruined their concept of trust. 
I grew up in a loving home and am incredibly privileged for that fact. I have very rarely experienced jealousy, in fact I have not experienced it since I was a teenager over boys. I organise thousands of events a year through my work, and whenever she cannot make one of them I don‚Äôt mind. The concept of giving out to someone and scolding them for not attending something that I invited them to doesn‚Äôt really make sense to me. 
The reason I am writing this is because I think my friend should speak to someone about their jealousy. I was so so so scared to tell her that I could not make her dinner to the point of heart palpitations. My parents are not her biggest fan, particularly my mother who says that her attitude is extremely immature. I want her to mention to her therapist this situation along with other situations so that they can help her overcome. Some of the things she has told me in the past in relation to friendship has been scarring (that I am not allowed to hang around with certain people, she doesn‚Äôt understand why I cannot stop talking to certain people that she doesn‚Äôt even know, that I am not allowed to take her friends, that I am not allowed to be friends with her significant other, that I am not allowed to hang out with the friends she met through me unless she is around, but to name a few. 
Please give me some advice, and also some advice on what I could say in response to her.

However, my boyfriend can‚Äôt seem to get the message that I‚Äôd like to receive these things as well.

I‚Äôve had an open discussion with him about this a couple of months ago.  I talked about how it made me feel and he said that he just isn‚Äôt very good at remembering to send those kinds of things but that he would try to remember. Months went by and nothing changed. So this past week, I ordered him breakfast as a surprise to see if maybe it would remind him of our discussion. So far, nothing yet.

We had thought about reviewing monthly seasonal flavors but decided that it was too subjective.

I am posting today because while our reviews were quite fun to write, after a couple of years of testing and consistently frequenting most of these places, we feel more suited to comment, re-rank, and discuss the wonderful ice cream parlours of YYC. We have learned a lot that you can not see upon just a couple of visits.

https://preview.redd.it/eid08o06ip5e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c6f9f54e21c8c5190b0fd92ad51496a94cebb59

So where to start?  
I think a revised one out of ten score, our individual lists do differ as our tastes and preferences differ, I imagine our readers' lists will be different too!

These are in order of favorite to least favorite, despite some of the scores being higher or lower, this is because of intangible reasons that may or may not be explained.

drunkenDAYlewis's top 10 list:

1. Village - 8.5
2. Milk - 9.5
3. Made by Marcus - 8
4. MacKay's - 8.5
5. Parlour - 7.9
6. Lic's -7
7. Love at First Scoop - 6.7
8. My Favorite Ice Cream S‚Ä¶ - 5.6
9. Abby's - 6
10. Daisy's 6.25

\-Specific\_Cookie-'s list:

1. Made by Marcus - 8.5
2. Village - 8
3. Parlour - 7
4. Milk - 7.5
5. MacKay's - 7.5
6. Love at First Scoop - 6
7. Lic's - 6
8. My Favorite Ice Cream S‚Ä¶ - 6.25
9. Abby's - 5
10. Daisy's - 6.5

**I just want to mention that Daisy's is now closed and hence being at the bottom of both our lists.**

So let's chat about a couple of those intangibles, there are many factors we account to get the numbers we do, things like selection, customer service, samples, whether seasonal flavors are offered, atmosphere, and much more.

On my list, for instance, Milk could be a ten, but the selection is too small to give it the number one spot.

It's clear from our list that we tend to prefer small batch homemade icecream, but that doesn't mean we don't occasionally stop at DQ for a quick treat, it's all ice-cream and even if a place is lower on the list, it doesn't mean it's bad, it's ice cream, it's pretty much always good, and this whole endeavor is really just for fun.

Feel free to share your lists with us, we're curious ourselves where Calgarians ranks these shops!

1h9vi4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1h9vi4j/the_best_day_of_my_life_was_the_worst_date_ive/,The best day of my life was the worst date I've ever been on.,"So, I'm a waiter at my family's cafe and i had worked the morning shift that day. A sunday, in April. I had the afternoon free, and my now ex gf and I were both free. But i didn't wanna go to her city, and she was fine wherever so i asked if we could go somewhere new. I don't like where she lives. Never enough parking. And it's confusing to get around if you don't live there. She said ""maybe this town 30 km from here?"" I said sure.


I drive us there, no traffic at all, I'm already loving it. I had just finished work and hurried up so i wouldn't be late. So i hadn't eaten anything yet. We take a walk. And we find an open restaurant. 

We ate at a restaurant and something upset her stomach so later while we were walking around this other city, she asks if we could stop somewhere since she needs to use the bathroom. I say yes. We keep walking a bit more and we find a small bar. A local place, on the outskirts of this town. A small bar, 3 tables that were pulled together and 12 or so men all sitting on one side, watching the game on the TV above the bar. All older folk aside from the waitor who i believe to be the owner. Retirement age i reckon. So anyway here we come in, me and my ex, we see what's going on, i ask if we could get coffee to go, he says no, but we can drink something on the terrace (the terrace being 2 chairs and this awful table that looked like a smaller ping pong table, all uneven and dented and cut up.) I say yes since i don't really care, she just needs to use the bathroom.

The bathroom is rrrrright next to the 12 dudes watching the game.

So the waiter asks what I'll drink. I say a coffee with warm milk. He says ""ah sorry, the pipe thing is broken, is cold ok?"" I say sure. My ex asks for an orange juice, dude snaps his fingers with a smile on his face ""for you, an apple juice"". She says sure. She excuses herself to the bathroom, i sit down outside and this dude brings me coffee with cold milk that was hot. Now i don't mean hot as in steamed or boiled up in a machine, no i mean a bottle of milk that's been in the sun or above a heater or something for a few days. It was warm and it shouldn't have been. So my ex comes back, we sit down and we talk a bit and i ask if she's ok, she says much better.

Then there comes this fuckin mutt again. What i forgot to mention about the waiter is that he's build like kyriakos grizzly (google him) but without the muscle and much more neck fat. He can't turn his neck. So he waddles up towards us, mid convo, crouches down to us and asks my ex if she saw the toilet paper above some shelf in the bathroom. She says she did but she had her own wet wiped so she didn't use them. He says aha ok, and goes back inside and it looked to me like he said something to the guys watching the game.

I'm turning purple from asphyxiation at this point from trying to hold in that yell cause it means as soon as she was done shitting, this fuckin moron got up and moved his friends around and went to the bathroom after her to count fuckin toilet paper and was genuinely concerned if she wiped her ass or not to the point that he goes to check up on her while we're both talking and stuff. She's dying of embarrassment, I'm dying of laughter but trying to not be too loud, and I'm adding fuel to the fire. ""You think he went there and was like ""34, 35, 36, 37"" and went out of breath and started counting while breathing in?

We pay, leave, and there's this mix of embarassment and laughter from both sides where we're now in actual literal tears, just talking about it for the next 20 minutes, walking back to my car. It's already been close to 3 hours since we've been out.

My car was parked about 3 km away. 20 minutes into messing with her is where my laughter stopped.

Cause that hot room temp milk I got in my coffee now fucked my stomach up. Now it was a mission. It was still funny, i told her how i felt now and that we had to go quickly. We make it to my car soon, and we go. I stopped at a mcdonalds while making our way back to the town closest to me and walked in there while it was pretty crowded and went to the bathroom and i shit out everything I've ever eaten that didn't come out. I was holding my ankles, praying to gods now forgotten, took my shirt off, fuckin sweat dripping down my body like i was being interrogated in guantanamo bay. 


That date we didn't hold hands. We didn't kiss. We didn't have sex. We didn't make small talk, we didn't cuddle. We were both in pain by the end of it but for both of us, even today, it was the best date we had, cause it was filled with joy, and laughter until our stomachs cramped and our faces were red and we both had tears coming down our faces from what had happened and the ensuing jokes we kept piling on during those 4 or 5 hours.

It was the best worst date of my life. And I'll cherrish that memory forever.",1,1733699253.0,self,0,1.0,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it‚Äôs you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength‚ÄîI wish I‚Äôd had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There‚Äôs so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it‚Äôs not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian‚Äîyour mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she‚Äôs gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I‚Äôve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I‚Äôm certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup‚Äôs rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn‚Äôt know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you‚Äôll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I‚Äôm deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea‚Äôs trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, ‚ÄúW-what does this mean?‚Äù

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. ‚ÄúNot here, not now. Let‚Äôs get home, then we can talk.‚Äù

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother‚Äôs shrill voice called after them, ‚ÄúLeaving already? You haven‚Äôt stayed for lunch.‚Äù

Sorin‚Äôs jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.‚Äù With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúDamn it, damn it, damn it.‚Äù

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea‚Äôs gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

‚ÄúD-do you‚Ä¶ think this could really be true?‚Äù Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. ‚ÄúLook, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might‚Äôve signed, we‚Äôll have proof.‚Äù He paused, deep in thought. ‚ÄúDad must have something lying around.‚Äù A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. ‚ÄúWhy did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could‚Äôve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!‚Äù

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt really know what was going on back then‚Ä¶‚Äù

A sob erupted from him. ‚ÄúI loved him so much, Drea. I don‚Äôt remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end‚Ä¶‚Äù

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another‚Äôs embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, ‚ÄúCall Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.‚Äù

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn‚Äôt rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! That woman is going to pay today. I‚Äôve tolerated her long enough!‚Äù He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

‚ÄúAdrian, no!‚Äù

================================================================================

Bad breath, or halitosis, is a pesky problem that many folks face at some point in their lives. You know the feeling: you've just enjoyed a delicious meal, had a great chat, and then it hits you‚Äîmaybe your breath isn't as fresh as you'd hoped. Many people will turn to mouthwashes and chewing gum, while others may look for more unconventional remedies. One such remedy that often pops up during conversations is hydrogen peroxide. So, does peroxide help with bad breath? Let‚Äôs dive in and see what the science says!

Understanding Bad Breath: The Culprit Behind the Smell
------------------------------------------------------

Before we get into the nitty-gritty of whether hydrogen peroxide can aid your breath, let‚Äôs take a moment to dissect what causes bad breath. It‚Äôs not just about eating garlic or onions; oh no, the reasons are often much deeper and more complex.

### Common Causes of Bad Breath

1. **Bacteria Build-up**: Our mouths are home to millions of bacteria. When these microorganisms break down food particles, they release volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), which are notorious for causing bad breath.
2. **Poor Oral Hygiene**: Neglecting regular brushing and flossing can lead to plaque buildup and gum disease, both significant contributors to halitosis.
3. **Certain Foods**: As mentioned, garlic and onions are common offenders, but other foods like spices, coffee, and cheese can play a part too.
4. **Dry Mouth**: Saliva helps rinse away food particles and bacteria. A dry mouth‚Äîwhether due to medications, health conditions, or just not drinking enough water‚Äîcan result in unpleasant odors.
5. **Smoking and Tobacco Products**: Not only do these products leave a lingering smell, but they also dry out your mouth and contribute to gum disease.

So there you have it! Bad breath stems from various sources, and understanding them can help us tackle the issue head-on.

The Role of Hydrogen Peroxide: What Is It?
------------------------------------------

Now that we're clear on what causes bad breath, let‚Äôs talk about hydrogen peroxide. What exactly is this substance? Often found in households, hydrogen peroxide is a colorless liquid known for its antiseptic properties. In concentrations of about 3%, it's commonly used for wound cleaning, disinfecting surfaces, and even as a teeth-whitening agent.

### How Does Hydrogen Peroxide Work?

Hydrogen peroxide breaks down into water and oxygen, producing free radicals that can kill bacteria. So, when you use hydrogen peroxide as a mouth rinse, it could theoretically target those bacteria responsible for bad breath. But does it actually work? Let‚Äôs dig a little deeper!

Does Peroxide Help with Bad Breath?
-----------------------------------

This brings us back to our main question: does peroxide help with bad breath? Well, the short answer is yes, but let's explore the details‚Äîand some pros and cons‚Äîbefore you rush to grab that bottle!

### Potential Benefits of Using Hydrogen Peroxide for Fresh Breath

1. **Antibacterial Properties**: As noted, hydrogen peroxide is effective against many types of bacteria, including the nasty ones that cause bad breath. By reducing bacterial counts in your mouth, you may find your breath fresher.
2. **Whitens Teeth**: While this isn‚Äôt directly related to bad breath, a brighter smile can boost your confidence, making you less self-conscious about your breath overall.
3. **Cleanses the Mouth**: Rinsing with hydrogen peroxide can help flush out food particles trapped between teeth, which might otherwise contribute to odor.
4. **Cost-Effective Solution**: Compared to specialized mouthwashes, hydrogen peroxide is often much cheaper and readily available.

### Risks and Downsides of Hydrogen Peroxide

1. **Irritation**: For some folks, using hydrogen peroxide‚Äîeven at low concentrations‚Äîcan irritate the soft tissues in the mouth. If you experience discomfort, you may want to steer clear.
2. **Not a Long-Term Solution**: While it can help temporarily reduce bad breath, it doesn't address the underlying issues like poor oral hygiene or health problems.
3. **Taste and Smell**: Let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîsome people find the taste and smell of hydrogen peroxide unappealing. It might not be something you want swirling around in your mouth.
4. **Overuse Risks**: Frequent use of hydrogen peroxide as a mouthwash may alter the natural balance of bacteria in your mouth, leading to other oral health issues.

### How to Use Hydrogen Peroxide Safely

If you‚Äôre considering giving hydrogen peroxide a try, it‚Äôs crucial to do so safely. Here are some tips to keep in mind:

- **Dilute It**: Always dilute hydrogen peroxide with water before using it as a mouth rinse. A common ratio is one part peroxide to two parts water.
- **Limit Frequency**: Don‚Äôt use it every day. A few times a week should suffice to avoid irritation.
- **Rinse Thoroughly**: After using hydrogen peroxide, rinse your mouth thoroughly with plain water to ensure there‚Äôs no residual peroxide left.
- **Consult Your Dentist**: Before starting any new oral hygiene routine, it‚Äôs always a smart move to check in with your dentist.

Alternative Remedies for Bad Breath
-----------------------------------

While hydrogen peroxide might help with bad breath, it‚Äôs not the only player in the game. There are plenty of other methods worth considering‚Äîlet‚Äôs take a gander!

### 1. Regular Brushing and Flossing

Keeping your teeth shiny and clean is one of the best ways to fend off bad breath. Brush at least twice a day and don‚Äôt forget to floss daily to remove food particles wedged between your teeth.

### 2. Stay Hydrated

Drinking plenty of water can help keep your mouth moist, washing away food particles and bacteria. Plus, staying hydrated is good for your overall health!

### 3. Chew Sugar-Free Gum

Chewing gum stimulates saliva production, which can help neutralize acids and clean the mouth. Just make sure it‚Äôs sugar-free to avoid attracting more bacteria.

### 4. Use Baking Soda

Baking soda is another inexpensive household item that can help neutralize odors. Make a paste with baking soda and water and brush your tongue gently.

### 5. Incorporate Fresh Herbs

Herbs like parsley, mint, or basil can freshen your breath naturally. Chew on a few leaves, or brew them in a tea for an aromatic solution!

### 6. Avoid Certain Foods

Take note of foods that tend to linger on your breath, like garlic and onions. If you‚Äôve got an important event coming up, it might be wise to skip these goodies.

When to Seek Professional Help
------------------------------

Sometimes, bad breath can be a sign of an underlying health issue. If you‚Äôve tried various remedies without success, it might be time to consult your dentist or physician. Conditions like gum disease, sinus infections, or gastrointestinal issues can all contribute to persistent bad breath.

### Red Flags to Watch For

- Persistent bad breath despite good oral hygiene.
- Bad breath accompanied by other symptoms like a sore throat, fever, or swollen gums.
- Changes in taste or difficulty swallowing.

Conclusion: To Peroxide or Not to Peroxide?
-------------------------------------------

To sum it all up, hydrogen peroxide can be a useful tool in combating bad breath, but like any remedy, it has its limitations. While it boasts antibacterial properties and can help clean the mouth, it shouldn‚Äôt replace regular oral care practices. Remember, brushing and flossing are your first line of defense. And if you're considering adding hydrogen peroxide to your routine, make sure to use it wisely and consult with a professional if needed.

Ultimately, tackling bad breath might require a multi-faceted approach that includes good oral hygiene, diet changes, and maybe just a dash of hydrogen peroxide now and then. So, next time you ask yourself, ‚ÄúDoes peroxide help with bad breath?‚Äù, remember it‚Äôs but one part of a much bigger picture.

I finish my shift at my grocery store (front end/cash) and decided to pick something up on the way out. Our Express lane faces one of our regular lanes. The path between is big enough and meant for 2 separate line ups and if it wasn't obvious enough a customer currently cashing out at both lanes. There's a gentleman before me standing in between both lines so I ask ""Are you in line?""

He replies ""I'm waiting to see which line is done first.""

""So you're not in a line?""

""No, I'm waiting to see which line is done first.""

Okay, so I walk over to the Express line and he snaps at me. ""Hey, it's one line!"" And he gestures behind him curving his motion indicating the line would start where he is and sharply cut 90 degrees down the path intersecting any line up that would happen at any of the other lanes.

Without telling him that I work here as a cashier I just say, ""Sir, it's always been two separate lines. Why would they allow one line for two lanes, which by your logic, would curve around and cut through the line up for the third lane?""

He keeps arguing that it's one line and he was there first so I look to my cashiers and they just shrug opting to stay out of it.

""Fine."" I back up and head to the third line.

While he's complaining to the Express cashier (and now holding up the line that started to form behind him) I pass by on my way out I hear the cashier explain ""It's always been two separate lines. If the lines do happen to get longer, Express would curve down this way (gesturing the opposite direction he originally tried to convince me of) and that lane would go straight down the aisle."" That's when I catch her attention and casually say, ""See you tomorrow morning, Kim. Want me to grab you a coffee on the way in?""

At this point I'm over it and don't really care if I am the asshole or not. Just more curious. I admit to having asshole moments in my everyday life.",17,1733698822.0,AITH,6,0.87,False

1h9vbjm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h9vbjm,"Update 1: Still work in progress, but appreciate the help!","I have tried to take a bunch of your feedback into consideration and wanted to share where I am a week later. A couple of notes:

1) Facilities was awesome and was open to helping me rotate the furniture 90* as many recommended. Unfortunately, it would have killed access to the whiteboard (and the whiteboard is firmly stuck to the wall) and I would have only had 18 inches to maneuver between the desk and the windows which was going to be too tight. We also found out that it weighs about a thousand pounds.

2) moving the hutch to coffee area isn‚Äôt possible because the hutch is 8ft long and the coffee cabinet is 7ft long.

3) Per facilities painting is not allowed

4) For the ‚Äújust work from home crowd‚Äù, trust me, I wish I could

5) I ended up moving my monitors so they were less exposed to the door and that also had me facing the white board rather than having my back to the door. It‚Äôs definitely better given I can‚Äôt move the furniture.

6) opening the blinds has helped the overall vibe a lot too.

I am working to get some nice pictures from my wedding printed/framed and I am planning to put some books along the long cabinet behind me. Still more to come, but I‚Äôm happy with the initial results! Thank you all for your help!
