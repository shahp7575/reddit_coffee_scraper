1gooyh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Peptidesource/comments/1gooyh8/bpc157_incredible/,BPC-157 Incredible ,"So I’ve been taking BPC for the last 3 weeks and been injecting sub-q in the abdomen. It’s helped with the pain in my elbow and general aches, but I’ve had back pain for months due to muscle strain. 
First two weeks I injected BPC at a dose of 250mcg twice daily. I upped that to 500mcg twice daily last week, still to no avail with regards to the back pain. 

I decided to give my body a break over the weekend without injecting and last night asked my wife to inject near the site of injury into my back sub-q. I kid you not, despite having only a few hours sleep, I am amazed at the absence of pain this morning. I didn’t realise at first as I was so tired from little sleep - as I got up from my desk to make coffee, I realised I didn’t feel the twinge in my back I have been feeling for months since going back to heavy lifting - this feels incredible and I can’t believe I didn’t attempt injection at troubled site sooner. 
My wife has had chronic back pain for years - she too has experienced some progress with the abdominal injections but we’ll inject near the back and see how that develops over the coming days and weeks. 

Also began incorporating TB-500 into the regiment towards the back end of last week, so let’s see how it goes. One thing’s for certain - peptides are the truth and disputing their significance is a non-starter. ",1,1731319811.0,Peptidesource,0,1.0,False

1goov25,https://www.reddit.com/r/airindiasucks/comments/1goov25/yep_never_again/,"Yep, never again","TLDR: Air India changes the schedule however they want without proper warning and could care less about you in any way. Also, if your flight is delayed, don't trust them. 

I grabbed a quick transfer from Kuala Lumpur to Kathmandu for work meetings. I had the choice of an 8 hour flight through India or a 14 hour turn around through Qatar. I would have rather been on a plane for 14 hours. 

The flight generally sucked. The seats were harder than any other airline I have flown. Water, coffee, and tea were the only drinks. They did serve food, but I didn't eat. The plane was blowing only hot air, then freezing. The landing almost chipped a tooth and swerved all over the runway for the 1st 200'. 

Transferring from one flight to another, they had one lane open. There were plenty of people, but they were just hanging out and talking. Then people started showing up that the guards clearly knew as they were greeting them kindly and shaking their hands. These people the had cut to the front of the line. This happened 3 times while the rest of us waited. Also, if you have never gone through India, take every single electronic put of you bag, anything, or it will be to the back of the line. 

Ok, made it through and made it to the gate with 20 minutes to spare. Only to find that the flight was delayed 2 1/2 hours. I ask to confirm the time and am told that is correct. No biggie, I will use the restroom and grab a drink. While enjoying my drink I get 5 repetitive calls on Whatsapp from a caller listed as Wanderlust Boy. I am not going to answer something like that and blocked the caller. I close my tab after an hour and return to my gate to see the gate empty. They moved the time up and I missed the flight by 10 mins. 

So what can they do for me? Nothing. They escort me to the security area, do some paperwork, escort me past the secure area, then tell me that they will not book me on another flight since I missed it and all other passengers boarded. I explain to them the time change. They don't give a shit. 

I call my company to rebook and have them confirm a flight for me the next morning as that is the first available. I go to the desk with a confirmation number. They ignore me for 20 minutes. I raise a little fuss asking if they are all too busy to help me. They threaten to call the police. I tell them go for it. (No police has show up). At the time of this message, I am still sitting waiting for them to confirmy ticket while they blatantly ignore me. 

I can't leave the airport since I don't have a visa, and I can't get to the hotel inside the airport since I don't have a ticket. 

I have no idea where my luggage is.

So I’m crushing on a guy and we’re very close and we talk a lot. Last week I asked him if he would like to hang out and have a coffee with me. He said not right now cause he’s busy but no problems later on (oh and he told me “I don’t drink coffe” with a little smiley - like yeah guy of course “coffee” means “coffee” lol)

So do you guy know other ways to giving him hints, like more obvious than a coffe but not directily telling him I crush on him? 

It’s been a year now and I would really like to know, even if he friendzones me I’m ready to take the risk and maybe move on. ",1,1731319285.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I tried Kingdom, Eternal Coffee and Detour Noir as of now. Will update as I use the rest. 

Eternal Coffee: Name checks out. As soon as I spray it, it gives off a burst of coffee. As a coffee enthusiast, I can definitely make out that this is the scent of Arabica + Chicory + powdered sugar. :)
As it dries down, it starts smelling a little cinnamon, a little less coffee and little more vanilla. Think of a freshly baked vanilla cupcake. The vanilla and cinnamon is what I get more of, and just maybe a touch a coffee / chocolate.
Its a projection beast, this one.

Kingdom : They hype seems to be real. I own the Le Male Exlixir and this one smells very similar. I'm sure there are nuances that I'm not catching, but this one feels more heavy or dense. Elixir was already a decent performer, so this one performing well does not surprise me. It does seem to do way better on clothes than on the skin.

Detour Noir : Did not expect this to be this good. It's definitely not as refined as Leyton for sure, in the opening. But the drydown is extremely close. This one last a long long time as a scent bubble. Projects well, but lot overly loud. This is how I prefer my scents. But it could also be me.gping nosebling over time. So can't tell with this one. 

All three are actually pretty great pick ups, honestly. Just be careful with Eternal Coffee. This will choke people out if you over spray. Could just he the scent profile though. Avoid spraying this one near the collarbone area.",3,1731319082.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,0,1.0,False
1goorl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1goorl4/had_a_perfect_first_date_and_then_the_next_day_i/,Had a perfect first date and then the next day i got told the vibe wasn't right and she felt like I was to forward,"Hi everyone, so to give context me (m25) and this girl (f25) matched on tinder about 2 weeks and a bit ago and the vibe was going really well and we were both very understanding and mature of each others work life and just clicked really well in general and she was really beautiful, we eventually made plans to meet on the weekend on a Saturday to play putt putt, so we eventually got to the day and we met and hit it off really well( to paint the picture we were playing putt putt by the sea).

We were making jokes back and forth. little innuendos here and there and just in general flirting and vibing, during the putt putt game I said if there is anything I say or do, she must just let me know if I am pushing the boundaries or if it's weird, she said if I was like that she would have let me know immediately and probably would have left. So things were going well and we were smiling and laughing.

After the game, we grabbed coffee and we walked the beach front promenade holding hands and she put her hand around my waist and I put my hand around her shoulder and we were vibing and talking about life and stuff the usual stuff you talk about on dates. Eventually we sat down at a bench and we were watching the seas and we were talking about life and stuff and we were just chilling. I then went in for the kiss, she smiled and kissed me back as well, not once but twice actually, eventually we walked backed to here car holding hands and we said goodbye and I said if she wants it would be awesome if we caught a movie together the next weekend, she said yes with a smile, hugged me and we parted ways

the next day i was chilling at home and I got a message saying thank you for the day but the vibe didn't feel right and she wanted to not go further so i tried to phone but it didn't through cause i just wanted to understand why cause throughout the date she seemed comfortable and happy and even wanted to go on another date.

She sent me a text basically saying she felt uncomfortable with the kissing(even though she leaned in and smiled about it?) and me holding hands was to forward, so I replied and said I thought we really connected and seemed like the date went well but also I said that I respect her decision and maybe we could be friends but she said the kiss kind of tainted any possible relation we could have had and she said she knew it wasn't my intentions to make her feel uncomfortable and the only reason why she explained herself is because I am a genuinely good guy cause usually she wouldn't explain herself to her dates,

I did appreciate the honest feedback and I said sorry I made her feel that way even though it seemed like peaches and cream on the date, I respect that she felt that way, I said if she ever wants to be friends or hang or talk she can always reach out but I won't reach out due to respect of not being invasive as she as of right now doesn't want a relation of any sort with me (which I respect).

It makes me sad cause I genuinely felt a great connection with her and I thought everything was going well and she seemed genuinely comfortable in my company, the only thing I can do is to learn from this and be more aware I guess and that's a good thing cause sometimes you need to stumble to be better.

Dating just confuses me cause there dates I have been on we're I have held hands and i have kissed and i have gone multiple dates with that person, maybe it varies from person to person, but from here on regardless i am actually going to ask if the person is fine with holding hands or kissing regardless of whether it's the first date or the tenth.

So in short I am bummed cause this was a amazing connection and she seemed like she was excited to hang out again but regardless i know the best thing to do is to leave it and learn from it and be better.

Let me know your opinions, I am curious on what you guys think about this whole thing and your take on it, but just to clarify, I am not trying to get her back, I realize I can't lol",1,1731319006.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

5. Sara - No explanation required 

Not visible 

1. Vivian - for someone who is laadla he's very very missing throughout the day, he's forcefully given a little smt smt in the episodes,.otherwise it's cigarettes, coffee, shitting on chahat/shrutika and now it'll be kashish, but not visible for someone with the kind of fan base he has . Vivian from initial days was quite fun but that's long gone 

2. kV - has gone missing, seems like he's accepted defeat, whatever his strategy may or may not be is not working anymore, he looks beaten down

3. Digvijay - has a lot more potential, is only visible when he's with shrutika atm but can do alot more 

4. Bagga / chum - Bagga is starting to open up recently, while Chum remains quietly herself as an introvert.

5. Alice - she's invisible in her own friend group, so imagine how visible she can be outside of that.

1goonb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1goonb2/anyone_else_on_part_time_childcare/,Anyone else on part time childcare?,"So we have a 2 and a half year old, he's been in part time child care for most of the last year (4 half days a week, 9-1pm). 

My wife works part time (nurse), 8 days a month - but 13 hour shifts. I work full time in 9-5pm role. We're finding lately though that the part time childcare is still tough. Our son is sleeping well lately but is still waking up at 6am. However, the big problem is he's just very very needy in the past couple months, constantly wants ""Up"", won't let us do anything on our own (e.g. make a coffee). He used to be play independently a bit more.

We're not sure we want to do full time childcare, as it would require my wife to work full time (3 x 13 hour shifts per week) to cover the costs,and her shifts are just too time & energy consuming for her to do that (she leaves for work at 6am and is back at 9pm, so the days she works she'll see our son for 10mins in the morning at most).

We're going to try get him into our childcare for the extra day a week (so 5 half days), which would help, but not guaranteed a place. We also don't want to lose our place - part time childcare where we are (Ireland) is very hard to come by, most places only do full time.

Anyway, just wondering what other people have experience with part time child care, was there a point that you realised it just wasn't enough any more and you needed to go to full time? Do we just have to accept we'll be exhausted most of the time either way?

I 29m was in a relationship with my STBX wife 28f for 8 years. Everthing was what i will describe as nearly perfect. Small argument here and there but nothing really significant or relationship altering. All of that stopped 13 month ago after she got pregnant. The child wasn't a surprise as we were trying for a baby. 

I seriously don't know what went wrong but around the 4 month mark my wife completely made a 180 switch from the kind, carring and sweet women she use to be to a total tyrant i know it's bad to speak of someone like that but that is the best way to describe it. 

I am completely honest when i say me breathing was an issue for her, waking me up at 2-3 in the morning because she wanted something specific and become verbally abusive when i refused to drive 40 minutes to get her an ice-cream she was craving. She went on a tyrade because she wanted chick fil A on a sunday and the place was close. Calling me a useless husband, everything under the sun, wasn't allowed to sleep in the same bed as her then being pissed at me in the morning for not sleeping in the same bed as her, cleaning the house because it's to loud then not cleaning the house, cooking something she doesn't want anymore but requested it earlier. I bared everything, every insults, all the verbal abuse. I never raised my voice towards her during this time. I begged her to get help, talk to a doctor, therapist, her mother anyone but she refused and that just made things worse because apparently i called her crazy for asking her to get help. I went with her to the doctor one time and when i brought up the mood swing the hell i was in for a whole week wasn't worth it. Talking to her mother as well, she tried to help but my wife will act overly sweet and she made it seem that i was the crazy one untill her mother left and it was back to hell for me, even the camara footage i have of her going off she made it seem out of context and i was made out to be the monster by everyone for not doing more or enough. she made it seem that everytime she got angry was in response to something i did. Me sleeping at 4am and she not being able to open a can of peaches was my fault earning me a can against the chest while sleeping.

4 month ago she gave birth, wasn't a easy birth but i was hopeful that things will somewhat return to normal but that is when the post partum depression kicked in. I again tried to help, i really did suggestions, research, talking to a therapon my own to find better ways to help her but everything i did just made things worse. I was against her with everything calling her a shit wife, bad mother even though those words never left my mouth.

Everything blew up when she actively became physically violent. My last straw was when she smashed a coffee cup on my head when i walked out the room after an small argument because i took to long to bring her the cup of coffee. i was busy with our son changing his diaper. This was the first time in 8 years that i rised my voice at her and told her we are done, she can pack her shit and move the fuck out of the house. 

She went to her parents house, she wanted to take our son but i didn't allow that, when she said she will call the cops i pointed to the camara in the hall way and told her she is welcome to try as the camara caught it all. A week later i was served with divorce papers, i wanted to file but didn't have time with work and carring for our son. I was to busy.

3 weeks back after i got back from work my in laws were waiting for me, apparently her parents got her to see a therapist after they threatened to kick her out because she became as abusive to them as she was to me. They finally believe me and that i wasn't making things up. They gave me a letter from my wife before the left. 

The letter basically says the following without writting everything out.

She is sorry for the way she treated me all those months, she doesn't know why she did it and has no excuse, after her parents threatened to kick her out and she saw a therapist and psychiatrist she is better now that she is on medication to help her. In the letter she says she stopped the divorce proceedings and want to give us another try. I haven't responded to her letter and told my lawyer to proceed with the divorce proceedings. I gave the letter to her as well as it contains alot of detail of what she did as well as her admitting to the verbal abuse, it's not just my words anymore especially for the things that happened in public the videos i have of it as well and the video of her breaking the coffee cup on my head with the hospital visit for the stitches and burn marks from the hot coffee. 

I am told I'm the asshole as she is getting the help she needs now and that i should forgive her and give her another chance, i should do it to keep our family together, if i truly love her, i will be able to forgive her for the things she did while not in her right mind. I am a monster because i have no idea what she went through.

My things is why didn't she take the help i suggested, i did everything humanely possible to help her and she refused, she made me out to be this evil person and everything i didn't wasn't right, good enough, not enough, nothing. Even when i removed myself from the situation that was also wrong. 

I have more than enough evidence to get full custody of our son and a prenup that protects everything i have including the house.

Can you give me some suggestions for yerbas in these 2 categories:

2. Organic sin humo - unsmoked

For the first type, i think molienda fina is my preferred kind of yerba. I’m currently having Sara suave which is really nice. I was curious if there are other yerbas in this category with a low caffeine content (even lower than Sara which doesn’t feel so strong). For example i read many people find Canarias too strong in caffeine. I’m trying to lower my caffeine intake (mate helped me stopping with coffee). Are there organic/sin humo molienda fina yerbas? (Apart from despaladas… i mean real molienda fina). How does Sara compare to Canarias and to Baldo?

For the second type, i also like unsmoked yerbas and for long term consumption i think i prefer leaning towards them. In this category i tried Kraus Organic which i liked. Again priority to mellower yerbas… (low caffeine)

I wasn’t someone who believed in quick fixes for weight loss, but I was tired. Tired of seeing the scale stuck, despite doing “everything right.” Countless times, I’d tried strict diets and exercise routines, but life happens. I’d lose a few pounds, only to gain them back with interest. Then, almost as if on cue, I heard about a new product promising something simple: adding a tasteless, natural powder to your tea to boost metabolism, increase energy, and help you stay on track with weight loss.

At first, it sounded too easy. A product I could simply mix into my morning tea felt too convenient. But the more I researched, the more intrigued I became by how it works. Unlike traditional fat burners that often come with jittery side effects, this one promised a natural approach. It’s made to speed up metabolism and curb hunger, without the crash. Plus, it’s gluten-free, non-GMO, and vegetarian. I could enjoy my tea, and it would work silently in the background.

I decided to give it a try. The first thing I noticed was that my usual mid-morning energy slump vanished. It felt like my focus was sharper, and my energy more stable throughout the day. With time, the other benefits I hoped for started showing up. The scale was finally moving in the right direction. It wasn’t a rapid drop, but it was steady, and it felt sustainable. My cravings became manageable, and those impulsive snack binges I used to have? They were no longer such a big temptation.

I also noticed an unexpected benefit: my teeth. Normally, drinking tea daily leaves a bit of staining, but the product actually contains an ingredient to counteract that. My teeth stayed noticeably whiter, which was a pleasant surprise.

As the weeks turned into months, the impact of this small daily ritual was undeniable. I was down almost 15 pounds in two months. I didn’t change much else in my lifestyle, but with this little addition to my tea, I felt like I had a gentle nudge helping me stay on track. It was like a companion on my weight loss journey, quietly working alongside my efforts.

But it wasn’t just the weight loss. I felt more capable and more in control, and that made me excited to try new activities and push myself further with exercise. The sustained energy helped me tackle workouts with enthusiasm I hadn’t felt in years. It’s that domino effect — starting with one small change, then watching it snowball into big results over time.

My journey hasn’t been without its challenges, but this product gave me something simple and effective, something I could count on. I’m genuinely grateful for the way it helped me shift my routine in such a gentle, yet powerful way. If you’re looking for something to help you without turning your life upside down, this just might be it.

As I delved deeper into the science behind the product, I realized why it was working for me in ways other methods hadn’t. This supplement is designed to blend with your tea without impacting taste, but its carefully chosen ingredients work with your body’s natural rhythms to increase metabolism, help with fat burning, and support energy.

The science centers around thermogenesis and metabolism. Thermogenesis is the body’s process of producing heat, which naturally burns calories. When the body’s temperature rises, it uses more energy to maintain balance, which in turn can help burn fat. This product’s formula includes natural ingredients that subtly encourage thermogenesis, which can lead to a steady, healthy rate of calorie burn. While thermogenesis isn’t new, many weight-loss supplements trigger it too intensely, leading to feelings of jitters and crashes. The gentle, tea-based approach here helped me avoid all of that.

One of the ingredients that seems to be key is L-theanine, an amino acid commonly found in tea leaves. L-theanine is known to promote relaxation without causing drowsiness, but in this formula, it also works to help regulate energy by moderating caffeine's impact. Caffeine, also present in this product, typically provides that energy boost, but L-theanine smooths out any spikes and crashes. Together, they create a balanced energy that supports focus and activity throughout the day, without the usual caffeine jitters.

Additionally, chromium is included as it plays a role in glucose regulation. Stable blood sugar levels mean fewer energy dips and less of the hunger that can come with sugar cravings. With chromium helping regulate glucose levels, I found it easier to resist reaching for quick snacks throughout the day, making the weight-loss journey less about constant willpower and more about a manageable daily habit.

Green coffee bean extract is another star ingredient. This extract contains chlorogenic acid, which has been studied for its role in supporting fat metabolism and balancing blood sugar levels. The chlorogenic acid works by reducing how much glucose is released into the bloodstream after a meal, helping the body to use stored fat as fuel instead of focusing on burning up immediate carbs. This metabolic boost helps with weight loss, especially when combined with the caffeine that naturally speeds up fat burn.

To top it off, the product also includes some antioxidants that help combat the oxidative stress that can come with weight loss. When the body is burning fat, it’s releasing stored energy, and antioxidants can help ensure that this process doesn’t overwhelm the body’s natural defense systems. The result is a comprehensive, science-backed approach to support weight loss without the negative side effects common in so many other methods.

Through a thoughtful blend of these ingredients, this tea-based supplement doesn’t just act as a temporary fix. Instead, it feels like it aligns with the body’s natural systems to encourage a healthy, sustainable approach to weight loss. Every element in the formula plays a role, working harmoniously to give your body the gentle push it needs. That’s why, for me, this product didn’t just work — it fit into my life in a way that felt sustainable and healthy.

**Is Tea Burn safe?**  
Yes, Tea Burn is designed to be safe for daily use, formulated with natural, non-GMO, and gluten-free ingredients. It is manufactured in FDA-approved, GMP-certified facilities, ensuring quality and consistency. However, like any supplement, it’s wise to consult a healthcare professional if you have any health conditions or concerns before starting.

**Will it affect the taste of my tea?**  
No, the product is completely tasteless. It dissolves easily into any tea—hot or cold—without altering its flavor. This makes it easy to incorporate into your routine without sacrificing the taste of your favorite tea.

**How long does it take to see results?**  
Results can vary depending on individual body chemistry, diet, and activity level. However, many users report feeling a noticeable increase in energy within the first week, while visible weight loss and other benefits generally become apparent within one to three months of consistent use.

**Can I take it with other beverages?**  
Although Tea Burn is specifically designed to be mixed with tea due to the way certain ingredients interact with the natural compounds in tea, it can technically be added to other beverages. However, for optimal results, using it with tea is recommended.

**Are there any side effects?**  
Tea Burn is generally well-tolerated with minimal reported side effects, as it’s formulated to avoid the common jitters or crashes seen in some other weight-loss products. Some users might experience mild digestive adjustments initially, but these usually subside as the body adapts.

**What’s the best time to take it?**  
Most users find it effective to add it to their morning tea to jumpstart the metabolism early. However, you can add it to tea at any time that suits your schedule, provided it doesn’t disrupt sleep if taken later in the day due to its mild caffeine content.

**Does it come with a guarantee?**  
Yes, Tea Burn offers a 60-day money-back guarantee. This allows users to try the product risk-free, with the option of a full refund if they’re not satisfied.

Eating a cracker usually solves the problem.
I get the same weird feeling when thinking about some specific foods or drinks (for example coffee, even though I used to love coffee) at anytime during the day. And sometimes it just happens randomly.

Anyway my question is, is that nausea? Does it qualify as the 1st trimester morning sickness?

So, the worst of the triggers is the CSA which i will spoiler for safety. But the post will talk about physical assault aswell both historical and more recent. 

Honestly, its like i've been thrown through a loop recently. I've been doing well to process traumas with a therapist over 60hours worth of therapy sessions at least 40 of them around regulation/trauma processing etc the rest just keeping things going and learning how to safeguard against winter mood changes as i also have bipolar with seasonal affect. 

About 7 weeks ago i was grabbed by the neck by a patient and they also trapped me in a corner and aimed to punch me in the face. I did get out the room though i don't really remember how right now but i did. 

I have since had about 4 panic attacks at work due to feeling like things have gone wrong  being triggered by something someone has said i.e. one patient explained in detail how he was assaulted as a kid (11 yrs old). I was around a similar age when the most traumatic epiosde of CSA happened. 

My therapist asked me last week if i knew why the attack had set off these symptoms recently and i do know but i can't voice it, she knows vaguly what happened but not details and i just can't explain it verbally. I tend to shutdown verbally when this is triggered. But i can write things down to get things out and it helps somewhat. 

Detail is spoilered below. 

>!so i remember being pinned to a wall being assaulted around 10yrs old, felt a hand on the back of my neck, i remember the feeling of my head being held down and being forced to give oral (this appears to have happened multiple times at this age and later at 13/14  but i don't know how many as most of this is body memories, one was a boyfriend when i was around 13/14, i remember being scared and him forcing me to touch him and hold my head down by my neck!<

There is also something when i was around 21 i was living with a friend we both the same sex (female) and she became abusive and she used to hit me in the face for sleeping, once that i remember she tried to strangle me and then kicked me in the ribs as i was on the floor and she was enraged. 

Around the time i was 29 i went out for a coffee date with someone from work (worked on the same hospital site) we ended up at his flat in which he assaulted me and locked me in his flat with him, again i don't really remember all of it. 

Barely anyone really knows any of this apart from the thing that happened at work as it was witnessed by collegues.

I absoutely hate people touching my neck, i can't have it, my therapist also thinks i'm autistic which could be part of the issue aswell. 

I can't seem to ground, stop the flashbacks or panic attacks so i have been to my doctors to adjust my medications to see if this helps and i'm working with my therapist about the new symptoms i'm struggling with, i am practicing self care as much as i can. 

But i'm really questioning why i'm reacting so badly, if its all really worth it if i'm going to feel this bad forever. It feels like two years ago again where i was first diagnosed and its hard to go back there. I keep telling myself that we are in a better position now but its hard to believe it when i can feel everything happening to my body all over again and its affect sleep/eating/work. 

If anyone has any advise i would be greatful. Sorry for the long post and in seperate places i'm really struggling with everything.

Anyone here looking for a partner down to get good food and company. Someone who's down to slurping some good Ramen noodles, savoring on some xiaolongbao or even getting a plate of good chicken wings like frankies.

And then mixing that up with some cuddling and intimacy after a long stressful week. I enjoy someone who enjoys these little pleasures as much as I do, someone who shares that same enjoyment for good food and warm company.

Me:

* Not from the Big 4
* Can be talkative

About you:

* You're someone along the Metro (Metro Manila). As long as I can reach it, or we can meet halfway it will be fine. Places like around Ortigas, Marikina can do as well.
* Can be a food buddy
* Someone who is open for both NSFW and SFW

I have a good job but it's not very fulfilling and it's making me pretty unsatisfied with my life. I'd like to take time after work to explore hobbies or new skills that could maybe help me pivot to other careers but I'm so damn tired after I get home from work that it feels like I can't even think.

I don't work more hours than most people it's just that my job requires intense thinking for the entirety of the day and when I get home I feel like my brain's tapped out and I can't use it anymore. I'm tired but it's not a physical tiredness (I get enough sleep and I sleep well, have been to sleep studies in the past when I used to have problems) it's more of a mental exhaustion. I also workout, eat well and am happily married with no kids. I don't do drugs, don't drink coffee and I don't even drink alcohol.

Just to be clear because of the subreddit rules, I think my mental health is doing okay so this isn't a depression issue. I do have ADHD but I manage it pretty well with meds and this feeling persists even on the weekends when I can devote time during the day (when I'm on meds) to pursuing hobbies/learning skills but I don't because I just spend all of Saturday recovering and then all of Sunday anxious about the fact that I have to go to work again.",9,1731317148.0,productivity,4,1.0,False

I'm Sonny, 38, male, from the Midlands in jolly old England. I'm happily married to my incredibly patient wife, work full time as some kind of IT project guy thingy and spend a lot of my free time immersed in some sort of nerdy media format or another.

I'm an introverted person, but I wouldn't say I'm anti-social. I have friends, but between working from home the last few years, my interests and my anxiety some days, I don't get out as often as I'd like, so it wouldn't hurt to meet and chat with some new people.

As far as interests go, Video games are my core interest. I have an unhealthy interest in Zero Build modes of Fortnite at the moment, but I often play a broad range of stuff from Project Zomboid to COD to Baldurs Gate 3 to Minecraft to Power Wash Sim to Sea of Thieves. There's plenty of other options, squirrels are to nuts what I am to video games...

Other interests include anime, comedy, a sense of humour, reading fiction, writing, autumn, fantasy, sci-fi, food, coffee, nature, computing, D&D, jigsaws, rain, bread, board games, Lego, doom-scrolling Tiktok, a decent variety of music, making unimportant lists that are disorganised and go on too long, and probably other stuff too. I dislike horror (unless it's in book format), fashion, sports, corporate-ladders and cauliflower. Even if it's not listed as an interest, doesn't mean I won't be interested in chatting about it, can be fun to learn new things.

I'm diagnosed with social anxiety, which can mean I sometimes fail to reach out or may seem less engaged than I actually am to begin with, and I'm diagnosed ADHD(-C) so can be a bit forgetful, absent-minded or erratic at times. Do with that info what you will. I'm accountable for these things, I'm always working on them, this is more of a polite heads up.

My only caveats would be that you are a very definitely defined as an adult and that your intentions are aligned with the subs, i.e., you're looking to make platonic friends, whole platonic friends and nothing but platonic friends, so help you Reddit. Also don't be closed minded or come baring any kind of bigotry, I've no interest in any of that and might be inclined to tell you to go forth and multiply. I generally approach these things slowly, I am only looking to text chat for the moment but may voice chat and have a game with people in the future, so be chill and be patient too I guess.

The ideal venue to chat would be Discord in the long term but I'm on Reddit frequently enough if you're not comfortable with that though. If you do reach out, introduce yourself a little (since you already have some info about me and I'd prefer not to have to start with an interrogation) and throw something that's your favourite to confirm you've read at least the caveats bit even if you switched off at some of the other parts. Favourite food, animal, causal post-apocalyptic event, whatever you like.

Well that's my spiel, I'll give my keyboard a rest. Feel free to reach out or drop a comment on this post. Hopefully see you around!",1,1731316891.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

I’ve watched it since the start, I was obsessed in the beginning! I even got my mother, boyfriend and best friend hooked on the show once it premiered here.
Since I’m not American I had to wait till the next day and watch it online in an unsafe way or stay up till very late in the evening to watch it live on sketchy sites. But I lost interest in the beginning of season 5 and would wait for a few chunks of episodes were available online and binge those or just wait for them to premiere here in Portugal later.
This couple managed to get me excited once more to watch it, I was so excited every week for a new episode and now….

On a side note, what is your favorite fic (if you read them) on ao3/tumblr/etc.?
One of my top 10 favorites was the one where Buck moved in next door to Tommy and was bothering him with the noise so much they started arguing via notes and eventually became friendly and Buck admitted to Tommy he was attracted to a guy he saw on a coffee shop and made a fool of himself….

1goo2fb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1goo2fb,Coffee tree leaves dying ,"TL;DR: my coffee trees' leaves are dying, what could it be?

This coffee tree is my boyfriend's. I started taking care of it when we moved in together. It has been slowly dying, but I think the process already started before we moved in together. 
The tree is losing its lower leaves, as you can see its already only a bare stem towards the pot. 
The leaves turn yellow / brown, with brown spots. I thought it was just them drying out / being old, but the brown spotting looks more like a disease / malnutrition? 
I water it whenever it starts to show signs of wilting, which is around twice a week, and have given it fertilizer regularly during summer. 
It sits on the ground next to a west-facing window with sheer curtains. 
It used to be in a pot with a couple of other smaller trees. I took them out around a year ago. They too show some signs of the browning, but not as drastic, see the last two pictures. They have been living right next to my other plants, but none of them have the spotting, so maybe its coffe-specific? 
Also, I don't see any pests. The soil used to have spring-tails, but since I repotted they seem to be gone. 
I'm really at a loss of what it might be and how I could remedy it, so any help would be appreciated 🥲",2,1731315852.0,plantclinic,0,1.0,False

Name: 41st Athens Marathon the Authentic

Date: 10 November 2024Distance: 42.195KM with 314m of ascent

Location: Marathonas, Greece to Athens, Greece

Weather: 13C, windy, slight clouds at start.  Sunny and 17C at finish. 

Me: 34yr old female, VO2 max 49 (according to garmin), no disabilities, physical limitations or significant injuries,  been running for 15 months total  

My Time: 04:27:15 

**Goals**

I didn’t go in with a strong or clear time goal, since I’m a beginner runner and first-time marathoner.   My first and only half marathon was 6 months prior and at 2:11:13, but on an unseasonably hot day and a very different course (namely, flat, whereas AMA is famously uphill).    I did have a pacing strategy which was to do the first, flat 10k on my fastest end of comfortable, then slow down to 6:15-6:30 for the long long uphill, and then pick it up to as fast as I could for the final downhill 10k.  The first two parts of that went just fine, but when it came time to pick up pace for the final 10 I didn’t have much speed left.   But, I finished without pain or blisters and a great big smile on my face.

**Training**

I started running 15 months prior with a couch to 10k plan in order to do an 8k road race, my first ever outdoor run, which I completed in 1:07:00 in October 2023.  After that, I started getting serious and built up to a handful of 10k races over winter 2023-24, a road half in March 2024, and a handful of trail races in the 12-20km distance in spring and summer, culminating in a 30km +1000m trail race one month prior to marathon, which I treated as my peak week for the marathon training block.

I used Runna’s 16 week “hilly” marathon plan.  I started out with the “advanced” option, running 4x a week with 2 quality sessions, 2 strength workouts, plus a tiny bit of pilates and yoga.   The running portion was way above my skill level and I ended up switching over to the intermediate plan in week 7 or 8 and increasing my time goal in the app from 4:00 to 4:30.   However I also added in 2x a week of advanced ballet at the same time. My shins suffered a bit from this, so I dropped to 1 strength per week and I eased up a little on the running.   I did three 30km training runs, two of which were flat non-technical trails, and one of which was a race with 1000m of gain.  The recovery from the race was pretty rough on my quads and shins, and I also suffered major sickness from my fueling strategy.  However I’m glad it happened because I switched off of caffeinated, standard gels and onto SiS isotonically balanced gels.  

**Pre-race (1 week prior to the race)**

Advanced ballet on Monday, 7km race pace on Tuesday, flying on Wednesday, advanced ballet on Thursday, and total rest on Friday and Saturday.  Focused on drinking electrolytes, staying hydrated, and a 3-day carb load.   Absolutely hated carbs by the end of it. 

The bib pick-up and expo is open for several days before the event. I went three days out and it was not crowded, no lines, a surprisingly good array of gear for sale. Better than the Lisbon marathon expo, which is really my only other point of reference. 

**Race day**

Woke up at 3:15am full of adrenaline. Tried to go back to sleep to no avail.   Got ready, had coffee and breakfast and toilet, decided to take an Imodium because of said toilet situation, walked to the shuttle buses to the race start. Cold!!! Boarded the bus at 5:45am which was organized and peaceful (probably it was more chaotic at the end of the 1-hour window), took a 1 hour bus ride to start along the race route, panicked about how far away we were. Waited at the city of Marathonas stadium from 6:45am-9:15am, during which time I ate and drank and stretched and tried to stay warm in my throw-away clothes. They had bag drop off course but I run with a vest and decided not to use bag-drop.   Plenty of portable toilets and space to warm up.   I started in block 7 of 12, and that was all very smooth and organized as well.  

**The race**

First kilometer was a bottleneck moving at 7:00min/km.   In an ideal world I would have started with the prior block, but you get what you get, and it was probably good for me to have a slow start.  First 12km went by smooth and quick.   Then from km 12-15 there is a warm-up hill of about 70 meters, followed by a short and steep downhill, and then the real hill- 15km of climbing about 200m.  I made sure to keep my effort manageable, and I was still feeling great by the 21.1km mark.  In fact, I broke my half personal record by a minute!      At this point the crowds started to pick up a lot, included a lot of grandmother types and kids, and they had really sweet energy.   



By 25km my joints were starting to feel sore and I took an ibuprofen, it must have worked bc I don't remember being in pain at all after that.   Psychologically, km 25-32 were rough and I was starting to feel very grumpy.   When I felt myself getting too grumpy I would high-five kids and smile and thank spectators which helped a lot.  When I reached 32km I was happy because I knew it was all downhill from there.   I also knew I had family on the sidelines around km 38, though I wasn’t sure how easy it would be to see them there.     It worked out perfectly, we were able to hug and one of them ran almost a km alongside me which was great because she helped me pick up my lagging pace— a few moments prior the 4:29:29 pacer had passed me briefly, and I wanted to keep ahead of him.  



The final 5km is full of spectators and the excitement of many familiar sites and knowing how close you are to Kalimarmaro.   The final finishing chute was great, and I was able to “sprint” the last 200m into the stadium (looking at my stats now, it was 5:00min/km, but at the time I felt like I was absolutely flying hahaha).     Trying to reunite with the spectators I had at Kalimarmaro was  chaotic and confusing but what can you expect?   


**Fueling Strategies**

1L of electrolyte water, another liter of plain water, isotonic gels at 5km, 10km, 15km, 25km, 30km.  Caffeinated gel chew at 35km. 

Many water stations were supposedly giving out gels, but I only saw one that actually had gels.   I saw banana peels on the ground at two different points, but didn’t see the actual bananas.  Bottled water freely available.   Hydration vests are allowed, and were used by many (including me).    

**Post-race**

Really, really pleased with my first marathon.  It was much more enjoyable than I expected, and I really didn’t experience very much “pain cave” - more like some grumpiness for 7km of the uphill section — so of course I’m wondering if I was maybe too conservative.   24 hours later, I have some moderate quad soreness and some generalized joint soreness in my ankles.    10/10, would do again.

Just bought a house for the first time. Shown is the room of the house where the living room is -- it has white tile as flooring, wood panelling, and lots of windows. Curtains in the photo aren't there though. The coffee table already exists, and the dark green couch is coming this week. The TV stand is negotiable if you don't think it fits. There's additionally a neutral standing lamp not displayed. Also, there are currently a lot of plants in this room but they may be moved since the couch is very large. 

Which rug fits best with this space? If none of the above, would love to see additional options.",1,1731313400.0,HomeDecorating,0,1.0,False

I visited Barcelona a few years ago. A friend recently mentioned that he was going and didn't know what to do, or where to go. I am clearing out my iPhone notes, so thought I may as well share the list, somebody might find it useful.

⭐️The Coffee House Barcelona

Very easy to get to by metro, lots of hams, cheeses, croissants etc, got like two ‘mixes’ for €15

⭐️Xurreria Laietana/Churrería Laietana

Basically order Churros for breakfast with thick chocolate and coffee, 100% have to go one morning, very popular.

🦐⭐️Colom Restaurant

Very popular one of the most rated on trip advisor for dinner, seafood etc, deffo go before it’s busy as there’s always a queue, worth the wait 

🍽️⭐️ Ciutat Comtal/Cuidad Contal

Continue to order plates throughout the course of the sitting.

🍕⭐️ Vapiano - If you're looking for easy food one evening, Vapiano is an Italian style place but catered towards young people, very good food and very easy and chill. We went there twice when we were struggling to pick somewhere to eat, not like fast food, all made fresh.

*Below: May not be for everyone, however I like to avoid tourist traps due to overpriced food and overcrowding. I would rather pay to help out a small local/family business, rather than spend money on busy overcrowded tourist spots. Others may wish to see tourist hotspots.*

❌ Eating at the Gothic Quarter, very touristy and servers will try to persuade you to come in. You can always look if you wish to eat there, however generally if people need to persuade you to come in (especially if it's busy) you often find yourself over paying. I'm sure the food is good, but you can find better.

❌ Again personal opinion but unless you really want to, then avoid going inside the Sagrada familia, it’s quite expensive and a lot of it is often closed for construction, there’s plenty other cool things you can see. You can visit free places, or you can spend your money elsewhere.

✅ Park Guell, you can either pay, or you can find areas that you can reach in the evenings for free, you can actually view the city from this spot (link at bottom) and there are plenty of places you can walk entirely for free without paying to go in, to see the exact same, worth going for a walk around the free areas 

✅ Castell de Montjuïc - Basically anything around that area is cool, you can walk all the way up, bus or cable car, old castle building with a sick view at the top, some really nice gardens around there too if that’s your thing. If you're interested, you can choose to pay to go inside.

✅✅✅ Mirador de la Farma / Turó del Carmel - Probably the best view of Barcelona you’ll get, bit of a trek but if you walk there before sunset you get a FULL 360 of the entire city, 100% have to do

Again, this was just my personal experience, you may disagree but these would be my recommendations!",4,1731313327.0,GoingToSpain,0,1.0,False

How to handle this ?,"Hi all, My boyfriend came up to me yesterday and told me that a person he knows will be visiting our town and that he will probably be meeting up with him at some point for a coffee or a drink. That is totally fine of course. But as I was with my boyfriend yesterday this person seemed a bit into him. His texts at least . My boyfriend didn’t hide the message nor has he ever showed me signs of misbehaving. That though triggered my anxiety, something i haven’t had with my boyfriend since the early days of dating ( we are together 2.5 years). I fully trust my boyfriend but my brain is drowning in stress hormones. So i did the unthinkable and behind his back saw all his conversation with this guy. Indeed my boyfriend does not provoke and he is being a decent person. The other guy though is being a bit of a non so friendly type of person (if you get my point)

And I’m not sure how to handle this. Any ideas?",48,1731313159.0,relationship_advice,3,0.99,False
