1jny9y2,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jny9y2/tired_of_girlboss_halfsie_pressure_i_honestly/,"Tired of girlboss/ halfsie pressure, I honestly want to be more of a housewife","I hate that society is so bent on girl bossing. They want us to be working full time, pay half for everything, and still do the cooling and cleaning on top of it. My older relatives didn't have to pay for anything and got allowances, and stayed home as the house wife. There's this shame that's going on where girl bosses say it's ""abusive"" and ""stupid"" to be a house wife ... but how is it empowering to be working, paying half, and still doing it (or a good portion of it)? If I wanted halfsies, that's what you get platonic roomates for. People argue a partnership should be splitting things, but i have never known anyone (or personally found) anything where it is a true partnership. Someone is always doing way too much atop paying for so much. 

But for context, I cannot find a decent paying job. The jobs I did have treated me poorly, and I often got harassed and no one cared about my safety. I could try to become a teacher or nurse, but many of my friends have and they are immensely overworked and have burned out. 

I currently do ebay at home and help with a little of the bills, but my SO pays the bulk of everything. I run errands, coupon for items we use, cook, clean, and meal prep for him. Personally, I'm a lot happier at home and I do enjoy cooking and keeping a clean and organized home. The meal prep and couponing has saved us a ton of money too. I enjoy ebay a lot and spend free time working out and doing my other hobbies. 

I think for certain households, having one partner be more of the housewife can seriously be more valuable than having a halfsie relationship where you both work and split stuff, especially if you're like me and cannot find a decent job. We don't have kids, but daycare is expensive and would pretty much eat up majority of my paycheck. This is a really bad school district, so we would need to move or home school. 

When I worked full time, I was so stressed and exhausted trying to do everything on weekends especially at crowded stores running errands. I struggled to meal prep and we struggled to keep up with cleaning. We spent so much getting fast food and coffees when we both worked. My so and I are both happier this way. 

For my situation, this is better and I'm so tired of people trying to tell me I'm trapping myself in or their ancestors fought to not have this. ",1,1743408880.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1jny72d,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jny72d/im_a_mess/,I’m a mess.,"This is my first post ever, but I’m desperate to speak to strangers who have been through this or similar. I know I’m not alone but I can’t help but feel alone. Sorry for the long post. 

I (24F) was with my fiancé for 9 years (25M), we were high school sweet hearts we watched each other grow up lived with each other, learned with each other. 2 years ago we bought our first home and bought a dog and June 2024 he proposed. Since June things have been go, wedding planning wedding viewing the whole lot. He was the most perfect person ever, so caring, selfless understanding truly no one like him ever. 

I feel I need to give more background on me, something traumatic happened to me in 2017. I’ve seen a therapist for etc but it’s changed me and my way of thinking, recently there are triggers that have brought my thoughts and feelings to the front of my head. I’m not a sad or depressed person per se but I’m pessimistic and sometimes scared to push myself out of my comfort zone. 

Following on, a week to this day he told me he was going for a run, I had texted him whilst I was working to make sure he got there safe. He never replied - no biggie I thought he was busy so texted him shortly after that telling him I hope he’s having fun, still no reply I messaged a few more times and nothing. He vanished for 4 hours I called and called and called him to which he picked up and said he hurt himself so ended up walking the distance and I just had a pit in my stomach. 
I got home and he asked if i thought he was cheating as my tone of voice was off so I said yeah and he just said I’m not. I believed him. He then decided to break up with me, he said we’re two complete different people and we have nothing In common anymore.

He’s very active; runner, cyclist and weight lifting. I’m somewhat the opposite i like to walk/hike dance fitness etc and I read books. 
He said we’re on different levels of fitness, he said that we’re on different wave lengths. He said he’s so positive and I’m so negative he’s not been wanting to come home… all I do at home is read my books that’s my downtime. I was so hurt, for 4 days I begged him to let me change and said we can work on this together we won’t get married and we will take back the engagement. I begged him offered him a break anything and he said he would think. With each day that passed I found something new out, the day after the break up he then said he wanted someone more adventurous and I’m not the person who can do adventurous - he didn’t give me the time to try. 

He proceeds to tell me that he’s had no feelings for me for a while and doesn’t find me attractive so I’m trying to understand because you can’t drop your feelings after 9 years. He even goes as far out to say he doesn’t love me and hasn’t for a while. I again am begging him to try to work it out with me, I say love is to be worked on, butterfly’s aren’t there constantly etc. I tried everything. 

Another day passes he admitted he had feelings for someone else who he worked with but promises nothing has happened and she doesn’t know etc. He said he doesn’t love her but the feeling he has around her he doesn’t get with me. I even offered solutions around that - move to a different department, change officies etc. He takes the evening to speak with his friend to clear his mind he comes back home and decided he doesn’t want to work on this together anymore, I agree this is probably for the best if he’s not willing to put the effort in. But it killed me. 

The day after I couldn’t shake the feeling he was still lying to me so I went through his phone and he was cheating on me with said girl he has feelings for she’s 20 years old. They met up whilst he told me he was out running he took her for a coffee date (something we’ve not been able to do because we’ve had no money saving for the wedding and remortgaging). 
The night he told me he went to his friends to think things through he was with her discussing it over food, whilst I’ve not been able to eat in a week he was feeding her and discussing ending this with me 
The messages between them both went on for 3 weeks he would tell her how sad I am how I don’t do anything to come out of my comfort zone he complained about me. He discussed taking our dog on walks with her and also admitted he liked her. 
I was heartbroken. 

We’re In the middle of listing the house for sale. And we’re avoiding each other in the home we share, it’s killing me. We’re never in the same room at the same time and he says he’s glad I know because he doesn’t have to watch his back and text her in secret. 
I just don’t understand how 1 week we were planning our lives together and the next I’m discarded and he doesn’t even care about me. He even said so himself. 

I’m so torn because all I want to do is work things out with him because I truly believe it’ll always be him but deep down I don’t want to let anyone hurt me like this again. He is happy with her meeting up outside of work whilst I’m crying every single night sat with my dog wondering how I’ll ever get past this. 
It feels like I’ll never be able to. I have no friends and I feel so lonely, when does this get better please😔",1,1743408489.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Dr. Chee Soon Juan has failed in business not once, but twice. First, decades ago with financial troubles and bounced checks. Now again with Café Orange & Teal—a business that folded despite public support.  

This isn’t just about coffee or cakes—it’s about basic competence.  

Our estate needs someone who can handle the real work: maintaining clean corridors, fixing lifts on time, managing millions in sinking funds wisely, and keeping our service fees fair. These aren’t political slogans—they’re the day-to-day responsibilities that keep our neighborhood livable.  

Yet Chee’s record proves he can’t deliver:  
- His businesses collapsed because he couldn’t control costs  
- He couldn’t sustain simple operations  
- He has zero experience successfully managing anything at scale  

Think about it: 
Would you hire a plumber who flooded his own house?  
Would you trust a driver who kept crashing his car?  
Then why would we trust a politician who’s never run anything successfully to manage our homes?  

Sembawang West deserves better. We need leaders with real skills—not talkers with a history of failure.

We’ve hung out a few times and he’s very nice/respectful but when it comes to anything financial I am completely on my own.

He spends money on himself just fine, like yesterday after we hung out he went with a friend to lunch, which he seems to do often.

I make a lot more money than him position wise and he talks about how he’s broke sometimes so it might be that but I think I’m just feeling a bit insecure about the situation and it makes me think that maybe he doesn’t like me enough to want to even buy me a slice of cheesecake?

I met this beautiful girl on Tinder 2.6 years ago. We were both average-looking, but she felt special to me. We had a wonderful relationship for almost two years, but things started changing drastically after that. We began having misunderstandings and small fights. I made mistakes, and so did she, but I always tried to improve myself and never repeated them.

I never broke her trust by talking to or flirting with other girls during our relationship. However, I was delusional in thinking she felt the same way about me. At the beginning of our relationship, she told me she was a virgin. She mentioned having a boyfriend before me but claimed they never had sex. However, after 3rd day of dating, she admitted that she had been intimate with him once. That revelation broke me, but she explained, ""I don’t want to keep you in the dark. I really love you and don’t want to hide anything from my past. If you want to break up with me, that’s totally fine because I lied, and I deserve it.""

I forgave her, and after that, we had a beautiful relationship. She never broke my trust again. We went on public and private dates, and those two years with her were truly special. She once told me that her ex never held her hand in public or even carried her bag when they met, but I did everything for her.

However, after two years, she started having intense mood swings and overthinking a lot, which eventually destroyed our relationship. About six months ago, she broke up with me and stopped talking to me for nearly 10-15 days. During that phase, I was the one trying to fix things, constantly reaching out to her, and begging her to work it out. After 15 days, she finally came back and admitted, ""I was influenced by my elder sister, who told me you’re not good for me and that you’re a red flag.""

(I guess she said this because there were times I hurt her with my anger issues, but I never crossed a line.)

When she got back with me, she mentioned that she had met a guy on Instagram during our breakup. He was a gym coach, and since she was slightly chubby, she took some fitness advice from him. But as you guys know, when a guy finds out a girl is single or going through a breakup, he often tries to make a move and he did. He started talking to her, flirting, and eventually asked her to give head massage to him coz he feeling tired. 

When I confronted her about it, she said, ""I didn’t like talking to him, so I just said yes to make him go away quickly."" That was the second red flag I ignored.

When I asked for her Instagram password, she had already deleted the chat. She told me, ""I deleted it because I didn’t want you to see it and get hurt. That’s why I’m telling you everything now."" But I was always suspicious about why she deleted it in the first place. I got angry and stopped talking to her for a few days. She kept trying to make things right, and like an idiot, I gave in again after seeing her sad face. I told her not to do anything like that again, and things went back to normal for a while.

But soon, her mood swings and overthinking got worse. Whenever we fought, she would block me. This cycle continued for the past month. Finally, she said, ""I can’t be with you anymore. I don’t want to hurt you like this. I’ve lost myself, and my overthinking has taken everything away from me.""

I tried to calm her down, telling her, ""Don’t worry, everything will be fine. Just stay, and I’ll fix it."" But she refused, saying, ""Nothing will get better. Everything is ruined.""

I asked her to meet one last time because I genuinely wanted to help her through her overthinking issues, but she declined, saying, ""I don’t feel the same anymore. It’s better if we don’t talk.""

She never said she lost feelings for me (smart move, I know), but I understood what she was trying to do. So, I finally let her go.

Guys, please don’t be like me. Never ruin your self-respect like this. Giving a second chance is okay, but a third? That’s pure nonsense. Don’t ignore red flags like I did. Keep your self-respect intact.

I got what I deserved for ignoring the signs. If you guys have any opinions on this, please share. I’d love to know what you think. Why did she leave so suddenly?

TL;DR:

Met a girl on Tinder, had a beautiful 2-year relationship, but things changed. She had mood swings, overthinking issues, and started blocking me after fights. She once broke up with me and talked to another guy during that time but later came back. I ignored red flags and kept trying to fix things. Recently, she broke up again, saying she ""lost herself"" and didn’t feel the same anymore. I finally let her go. Lesson learned: Never ignore red flags and never lose your self-respect.",5,1743407757.0,Indiangirlsontinder,8,0.86,False

Also i’m too shy and socially awkward to start a conversation first. i found his account myself through his work email, which my friend from work gave me. 

Also I’m leaving this job today, and i just can’t randomly approach him today and say “hey wanna go have a coffee together?” it would be too unexpected for him. Our only interactions were smiling at each other when we met in hallway past few weeks and say “hello” or “goodbye”. But he smiled at me differently, not like to a regular colleague, and kept eye contact for extra few seconds. 

So my question is, would it seem creepy to you if some girl/guy you work with, but never really talked to, found your instagram account and liked your posts? 

As for me, i wouldn’t find it creepy, especially if i showed this person the smallest hints that they’re attractive to me, but again i’m kinda autistic and maybe normal ppl don’t think the way i think? Lol

I am sorry if that question is not suited for this sub, please delete this post if it is not considered ""medical enough"" for a lack of a better term.


I've got worn down teeth due bruxism. Since february I am wearing a nightguard to prevent further damage. I assume I started grinding around one year ago due stressors in my life. It is hard to tell tho since my regular dentist never mentioned anything in the check ups I've had since then.

I do not smoke or drink coffee since almost a year and rarely drink alcohol. I am in my mid twenties so way too young to have teeth lik that.


Depending on the lighting the look of my teeth ranges from rather normal, read white and ""normaly"" thick looking, to completely yellow, translucent/black at the edges and worn down. I notice it looks way worse if natural light is involved.

My questions are:
1. Am I going insane or does lightning have such a drastic effect on teeth (atleast teeth in the state of mine)?
2. What options do I have to improve the aesthetics of my teeth? Can bleaching be enough to fix the lightning issue, provided it is even adviced/possible to bleach with moderate enamel loss?
Do I need composite bonding, veneers or crowns? Provided those can be answered without having seen my teeth of course.


I have not attached pictures because, quite frankly, my teeth do look different in each damn picture I take so I don't know which one is reprensative.

I actually would still really love to get one... I have the backyard and space for one... I have a pretty extensive background (But not 'college certified') background in animal care, biology, etc... and I do an extensive amount of hiking in my area with plenty of places that I swim... I'm even considering adding a pond to my back yard at some point because.. well... I have the space for it... so... fuck it... might as well... 

Everyone and their mother literally tried to talk me out of it last time while in the process because welp... at the end of the day things get a bit fucked with online pet ordering and the whatnot but like... I love working with aninals.. I like being outside... I literally bought a fucking dog beg for the little guy I was trying to get and even fuckin named him Butter. 

These are just three of the only animals I'd ever want to own or work with again... the other two being dogs and owls or birds of prey. 

I did also have an owl for two and a half months the last year that I rescued out of the middle of a busy road. Sadly Beaky got out and I couldn't get her back :-/ that shit was heartbreaking... 


So like... anyone know how to hook me up with a job at a local zoo or like... could hook me up with a baby otter or something? I live with my grandparents and we had my uncles dog for two months while he was recovering from major surgery and it was the first time we've had an animal around since maybe 2011-2012... it made them happy but it absolutely brought meaning to my life again as well.. 

I know there a fucking ton of legalities and whatnot on this but like... I'm 100% serious about it. I have three aquariums and they are a really good talking point and daily interactions between me and my grandmother since I moved back with them last year, and my grandfather was out in the backyard almost constantly playing with the dog. 

Honestly, it seems like a pipe dream but I might even check out the next exotic animal show we have at our state fair just to see if I can find one... 

Also...I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY about the difficulties, the smells, the blah blah blah blah laundry list of stuff associated with them. It still hasn't ever changed my mind about it though. I would love to have a little water weasel or two lol. 

Also I'm not autistic or anything like that, but animals really help keep me grounded and motivated on a daily basis. The last animal we actually had like I said was the owl and I personally spent upwards of 6-7 hours daily with it while my grandparents spent a decent amount of time as well interacting and taking care of it if I had to travel.

Pls don't contact me if --
* you want to do online virtual sugaring - not my cup of tea pls with all due respect
* you want upfront payment transactions, gift cards etc - purely to avoid scamsters/time wasters

What do I seek/expect --
* Someone who is confident, bubbly, radiates positive vibes, is humorous & quirky , communicates clearly on their expectations and with whom I can emotionally connect to find a solace for my loneliness/stress due to work.
* Someone who really enjoys the fun part whole heartedly and is really involved. I would never want anyone with any sort of inhibitions or forced mentality and is non-involved.
* Someone who wants to keep this connection completely discreet with no emotional drama. This will be an absolute NSA arrangement. Pure mutual benefit connects only.

What can I provide ?
* Be treated with the highest level of dignity and respect. Your safety, privacy and discretion will be dealt with the highest regard.

I’m wondering if I’m overthinking or if this is just how relationships evolve.

Hey Reddit, I’m 22/F and I’ve been seeing my partner, 33/M, for about 10 months now. He’s been my first real dating experience (seriously, I’ve never had a boyfriend before him). We met last summer, and everything felt great from the start. We’d text all day, every day, and were constantly looking forward to spending time together. Our first date even lasted 16 hours! A month and a half later, we made it official.

After 3 months, we decided to take a break due to some issues — I was slow to open up emotionally (partly because of past experiences), and I started grad school, which I ended up prioritizing. It was a mutual split, and we admitted we’d likely get back together, which we did six days later. Since then, we’ve been exclusive, though the relationship label is still unclear, and I feel a bit uneasy about bringing it up again after a previous attempt didn’t go well. Regardless, I know we both care about each other a lot.

We’ve been really supportive of each other and mainly show it through acts of service. He does my car service for free, adjusts his schedule for me, and is always asking how I’m doing — emotionally, academically, etc. I try to reciprocate with small gestures, like massaging his shoulders and helping him with his weekly testosterone injections (he’s on testosterone therapy and has a fear of needles). He’s been kind in always paying for dates and does show initiative to make plans, and while I’d like to contribute more, my grad school schedule doesn’t always allow for it, and he’s understanding of that.

I also want to highlight how supportive he’s been with me recently after I found out I was pregnant. I told him right away, and he was calm and reassuring, saying he’d support whatever decision I made. He even offered to cover any costs, which was a huge comfort. He’s never pressured me, and I truly appreciate how considerate he’s been during this time.

That said, lately, I’ve been feeling unsure about the direction of our relationship. I miss the energy and excitement we had in the beginning. It’s not necessarily affection that I’m missing — more so the “chase” or the thrill of getting to know someone in a new, exciting way. We haven’t said “I love you” yet, despite the care we show for each other. I attribute that to the lack of clarity that left us both in limbo and I fear that shifted everything. I also find myself comparing our relationship to what I see in my friends’ relationships. They get sweet surprise gestures like coffee or flowers, and while my partner is thoughtful and does ask if I need anything, I sometimes wish for a bit more spontaneity and excitement — like the little surprises or the unpredictability we had earlier in our relationship.

I’m not sure if I’m overthinking things or if this is just the natural progression of relationships. I feel valued and respected, but I also miss that spark we had at the beginning. I care about him a lot, but I’m wondering if the dynamic has shifted too much or if I’m just adjusting to how relationships evolve over time. Any advice on how to navigate these feelings and whether this is something I should discuss with him?

1jnxnym,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1jnxnym/how_does_laughland_teeth_whitening_work/,How does Laughland teeth whitening work?,"Teeth whitening has always been something I wanted to try, but I didn’t want to spend hundreds of dollars at the dentist. I’ve used whitening strips in the past, but they made my teeth sensitive, and the results were uneven. Laughland teeth whitening caught my attention because it claimed to deliver **professional-level results without pain or sensitivity**.

After seeing multiple reviews, I decided to test Laughland teeth whitening for myself and see how it works. **Does it really make a difference? Is it easy to use?** Here’s everything I found out.

# What Comes in the Laughland Teeth Whitening Kit?

The first thing I noticed was how **simple and straightforward** the kit is. No unnecessary extras—just what you need:

* **Whitening Gel Pens** – These allow you to apply the gel evenly on your teeth.
* **LED Mouthpiece** – This is supposed to speed up the whitening process.
* **Easy-to-Follow Instructions** – Clear steps to get the best results.

I appreciated that it wasn’t a complicated process like some whitening kits that require mixing powders or using bulky trays.

# How Does Laughland Teeth Whitening Work?

Laughland’s process is fast and simple, taking just **10 minutes per day**. Here’s what I did each day:

1. **Brushed and dried my teeth** before applying the gel.
2. **Used the pen applicator to apply the whitening gel evenly** on my teeth.
3. **Inserted the LED mouthpiece** and left it on for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinsed my mouth and cleaned the mouthpiece** for the next use.

The gel **had no weird taste** and wasn’t messy. I liked that I didn’t have to deal with strips that slide around or trays that make it hard to talk.

# My Results After 6 Days

* **Day 1:** No immediate change, but my teeth felt cleaner.
* **Day 3:** Noticed some of the staining around the edges of my teeth starting to fade.
* **Day 6:** My teeth were **about 6-7 shades whiter**, and the whitening looked even and natural.

The best part? **No sensitivity at all.** Whitening strips always made my teeth feel weak, but I didn’t experience any discomfort with Laughland.

# What Makes Laughland Different?

Unlike other at-home whitening products, **Laughland combines dentist-approved ingredients with LED technology**. Here’s what I think made a difference:

* **Hydrogen Peroxide Gel** – This is the same type of whitening agent dentists use, but balanced to be safe for at-home use.
* **LED Mouthpiece Activation** – The blue light helps **speed up the whitening process** by breaking down stains faster.
* **Temperature-Controlled Formula** – Unlike some whitening kits that weaken over time, Laughland’s gel is **stored properly to maintain full potency**.

Compared to **whitening strips, whitening toothpaste, and professional treatments**, **Laughland feels like the best balance** between effectiveness, safety, and affordability.

# FAQs About Laughland Teeth Whitening

**1. Does Laughland damage enamel?** – No, the gel is designed to **whiten teeth without weakening enamel**.  
**2. Can it remove deep stains?** – Yes, it noticeably reduced coffee stains on my teeth.  
**3. How long do results last?** – Results can last **several months** with good oral hygiene.

# Tips for the Best Results

* **Use it consistently** – Daily use makes the biggest difference.
* **Avoid coffee, tea, and wine** – These can slow down the whitening process.
* **Brush and floss regularly** – Helps maintain results for longer.

**Thinking about trying it? More details are available** [**here**](https://getlaughland.com/offer-01/?lpid=1039&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1039&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1039&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1039&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)**.**

# Final Thoughts – Does Laughland Teeth Whitening Work?

After **six days**, I was genuinely impressed with how well Laughland teeth whitening worked. My teeth were significantly whiter, **without any pain or sensitivity**.

Would I say it’s better than professional whitening? Probably not for extreme cases, but for **an easy, effective, and affordable way to whiten your teeth at home**, it’s definitely worth considering.

As I continued walking and time passed, I became increasingly nervous, ""how is she keeping up with me, and where could she possibly be going?"" When I made it to my apartment complex, I rationalized it that she resided in the apartment. I walked in and started running up the stairs.

As soon as I started getting up there, I felt myself pulled down by my shirt hitting the floor. My head, body, and brain ached, and it all felt a blur. I saw what appeared to be a face, and while my ears echoed, I heard faintly, ""hello handsome, I saw you at the coffee shop, and I couldn't help, but get a better look at you. I'm sorry... I hurt you, let me heal you..."" She placed her hand on my face, and I felt absolute fear, I wanted to scream but I could not...

With tears flowing down my face with perhaps a developing concussion I mumbled what I thought to be, ""you could have just said hi, please do not hurt me, my dominant queen.""

""You are okay, we are together now, hush people are coming."" She began putting duct tape around my mouth and my hands, and it was clear I was in the midst of a kidnapping, and I had to escape this crazy girl's domination.

I began desperately attempting to untangle and clawing my way out as she tried to wrap me up like One-Day-Express shipping mail order husband, she was strong.

With me fighting back she forced me down and barking at me ""you are ungrateful my boy, you do not realize when you have a compassionate companion who cares for you, who will love you in ways no one else can, who is loyal."" My body was being pulled and tugged on from this emotionally clingy being. In an emotional pit she left me without notice, left in the side halls of my apartment complex tied up.

I dragged myself over to a pipe, and began scraping at it till the duct tape was loose enough to tear my hands free, and I checked for my keys, and made it to my apartment. I began asking myself what I had experienced, and why these sorts of things always happen to me. I am just built different I reasoned. I checked my pockets further, and noticed she left a note with a time and location to meet up. Perhaps she has learned from her errors and has been humbled by my logic of emotional self-control and planned cautious action.

The calm after the storm 

A cascading rainbow after the rain, promising to never flood the earth again 

A lucky penny on the ground 

That yellow light at an intersection 

I am a deer appearing out of nowhere into the yard

Tibetan singing bowls, gongs and chimes emitting high vibrational sounds 

A fading smile on a billboard 

I can be found soaring high above the Redwoods 

Among the grains of sand at the Coral Reef

That sense of accomplishment after conquering the peak to Mount Everest

A river flowing through the Grand Canyon carving out rock formations

The solar wind interacting with the Earth’s  magnetosphere of Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights)

Flowing from every gushing and plunging waterfall 

I am a flock of birds flying in formation in tandem 

A sunrise in the East and sunset in the West

An inner nagging voice providing guidance and wisdom 

I am floating bubbles blown from a bubble wand

That first bitter sip of coffee in the morning 

A random thought infiltrating your mind on the spot 

An a-ha moment leading to a monumental breakthrough 

A yard full of flowers blooming on a beautiful spring day 

I am that sweet smell of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies 

Patterns and sequences on clocks, license plates, telephone numbers and residential addresses 

That song that keeps playing inside your head 

A vivid image coming to you in a dream 

A wish coming true after you blow out all the candles on your birthday cake 

I am a flickering light in a dark room that can not be explained 

A vanilla scent wafting by 

An exquisite butterfly conveying messages from another world 

I am a white feather fluttering by in the breeze 

A shadow emerging in your peripheral vision 

That booming voice and laughter permeating the moments of silence  

A blissful memory of quintessential days

That pitter patter of rain hammering down on a tin roof

I am that heart shaped cloud formation high above the luminous, blue sky 

A four leaf clover in a patch of dandelions 

I am that unforeseen warmth restoring your heart chakra 

I am that presence with a special touch on the hand, bestowing comfort and peace 

That sense of enlightenment during quiet reflection 

A guardian angel materializing with messages of love and peace in your mind’s eye 

I am that circular orb of light flashing by 

If you flinch twice, I will vanishingly be lightning fast in the blink of an eye",0,1743405962.0,UnsentLetters,2,0.5,False

1jnxlv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/RWBYOC/comments/1jnxlv4/id_like_some_feedback_on_an_oc_i_created/,I’d like some feedback on an OC i created,"I’ve recently was inspired by some old noir  detective film to create my latest OC, Ernesto Fumo or better known as Smoke PI, so I created a character bio for him. I’d like some creative feedback on how i could improve this character I’m wanting to fully flesh out.

Character Summary: Ernesto Fumo, Smoke PI
Role:
Occupation: Private Investigator


Setting: Mistral’s shadowed depths


Description: A lone wraith slicing through the city’s fog-laden underbelly with relentless precision.


Targets: Syndicates choking the slums, White Fang cells twisted by fanaticism, and the veiled threads of Salem’s design.


Status: A spectral hunter unbound by Huntsman oaths or Ozpin’s cryptic council.


Actions: Investigates missing Faunus reclaimed from traffickers and drags corruption into flickering torchlight, rippling through Mistral’s criminal maze as a quiet scourge eroding its foundations.


Recent Feat: Toppled Jacques Schnee’s empire through calculated strikes, exposing abuse and rot, protecting Willow and Whitley Schnee while dismantling a tyrant’s reign.


Reputation: A whispered savior to the desperate; a chilling legend to the guilty, his name—“Smoke PI”—echoing like a death knell through dive bars and rain-slick alleys.


Appearance:
Build: Lean, muscular frame sculpted from Mistral’s muck, blending menace and mystery.


Skin: Dark tan, a weathered hue forged by Mistral’s harsh streets.


Eyes: Left a milky-white eye (sight lost to a childhood blaze); right a sharp, coal-black stare cutting through dusk like a predator’s gleam.


Scar: Stark white, jagged and molten, mapping the fire’s ruin around his blinded left eye—a vivid contrast against his dark tan skin.


Hair: Short black, cropped tight at the sides, longer and tousled atop, graying at the temples like fading ash—revealed only in rare, unmasked moments.


Presence: A paradox—melts into mist yet looms with unshakable menace, softened fleetingly with Willow when the mask lifts to show the man beneath the wraith.


Clothing/Aesthetic:
Suit: Black, tie-less collar loose and creased from sleepless hunts, taut like a mourner’s shroud stretched thin by resolve; resistant to small arms fire and blunt force impacts, offering a small level of protection if his Aura breaks.


Pants: Crisp black dress pants hugging his legs, stark lines defying wear, paired with polished black leather dress shoes murmuring on rain-slick stone with a thief’s grace; resistant to small arms fire and blunt force impacts, providing minor safeguarding without Aura.


Mask: Sleek, obsidian, featureless shell muffling his voice to a low, guttural rasp scraping like a blade on bone; resistant to small arms fire and blunt force impacts, granting a slight buffer if Aura fails, enhancing his wraith-like durability.


Goggles: Silver with smoked lenses, fully encompassing the mask’s eye slits, rims snagging faint glints like embers in shadow, amplifying his ghostly aura.


Gloves: Black leather, worn smooth from countless grips, shielding his hands while adding a quiet menace to his silhouette.


Coat: Long trench, black as a starless void, hem frayed and trailing like a carrion bird’s tattered wings, flared collar framing his masked visage, having his signature symbol, a gray, smoke-like pattern, embroidered on the back; resistant to small arms fire and blunt force impacts, a faint shield when Aura falters.


Fedora: Scuffed black, tilted low and rakish—a gift from Dario Slate—casting eyes in shadow, brim worn smooth by restless fingers.


Palette: Rogue’s defiance against Mistral’s fog—mourning black marking a man hunting truth through ceaseless dusk, now stepping into tentative light, bolstered by subtle resilience.


Weapons: Obsidian Razor, Tanto, & Glock
Obsidian Razor:


Description: Gladius-style short sword with a matte black blade, its razor-sharp titanium-steel edges gleaming faintly in contrast; kept in a scabbard attached to his belt, concealed beneath his trench coat.


Function: Slices through steel, Grimm hides, or syndicate armor with lethal precision.


Purpose: A sleek, deadly tool reflecting Ernesto’s shadowed resolve, its compact form suited for close-quarters mayhem, relying on raw craftsmanship rather than Dust.


Tanto:


Description: Compact, single-edged dagger with a polished steel blade, gifted by the Mistrali yakuza clan for rescuing their leader’s daughter from kidnappers seeking ransom.


Condition: Pristine, its hilt wrapped in black silk, a subtle nod to its ceremonial origin.


Function: Wielded with surgical accuracy for silent strikes or desperate defense, often tucked into his coat for quick access.


Purpose: A token of gratitude turned practical weapon, embodying Mistral’s underworld honor.


Glock:


Description: Matte-black pistol strapped to his right thigh.


Condition: Grip scarred and pocked from frantic draws, etched with chaos of close calls.


Function: Barks precise rounds, dropping assassins and enforcers with brutal intent—a grim whisper of finality in tight corners or shadowed standoffs.


Purpose: Pure, unadorned utility, a blunt killer forged for survival.


Combination: Obsidian Razor, Tanto, and Glock weave a trinity of precision and fury, tools of a man balancing shadow, honor, and flame.


Tools:
Handcuffs:


Description: blackened steel, scuffed from years of use, dangling from his belt.


Purpose: Simple, unyielding promise of justice, snapping onto wrists of traffickers and enforcers with a cold click—a rare triumph in Mistral’s gloom.


High-Resolution Camera:


Description: Compact, battered, resting in an inner coat pocket.


Purpose: Lens sharp enough to capture syndicate ledgers, White Fang masks, or Viktor’s shady dealings in stark detail, each snapshot a shard of evidence dismantling empires.


Smoke Bombs:


Description: Small, midnight black orbs tucked at his belt, bursting into thick, choking clouds laced with silver wisps.


Purpose: Amplify Ash Veil to blind and disorient, a shroud he vanishes within to strike or flee, bolstering his spectral tactics.


Semblance: Ash Veil
Form: Churning cloud of gray and black smoke, silver flecks flickering like embers in his Aura.


Duration: Holdable for up to 30 minutes at a time.


Abilities:


Transforms into a spectral form, seeping through cracks, rising over spires, or melting into dusk.


Reads air’s pulse—ripples of breath or heartbeat—voice a hollow, rasping chill prickling skin.


Shifts like a phantom, fading from one shadow to ambush from another.


Utility: Predator’s cloak for infiltrating locked dens, evading lethal traps, or striking with chilling precision.


Limits:


Untouchable but toothless—no blows land, only echoes linger.


Aura bleeds with every moment, 30 minutes risking collapse.


Rapid shifts strain focus, causing faint tremors.


Solidifying mid-fight risks a fatal stutter.


Essence: Spectral gift balancing refuge and restraint, mirroring a man drifting through life yet tethered to scars.


Personality:
Jaded:


Forged by betrayal and fire into steely cynicism.


Trust a rare spark kindled by instinct, world a battlefield where hope’s a luxury—softened only by Willow’s presence.


Principled:


Creed burns bright—no kids, no innocents, truth above all.


Lone torch guiding his shadowed path, unyielding despite isolation, driving him to shield Willow and Whitley from Jacques’s wrath.


Witty:


Dry humor slashes like Obsidian Razor, sardonic glint piercing gloom.


Barbs sting foes and disarm allies—Qrow catches the sharpest, Willow the warmest—a shield against despair.


Guarded:


Smolders warmth beneath the mask, hoarded for Qrow and Lisa, now blooming openly with Willow.


Once buried under steel-clad caution, now cracking as he admits love.


Relentless:


Each case a hunt, a shard of justice chased with an ember-like will refusing to gutter.


Razes Viktor’s empire and topples Jacques with unyielding resolve.


Habits:


Lights cigars with allies in hushed pauses—Qrow and Roman savor the rite, smoke curling like a shared oath.


Fingers fedora’s brim when thoughts tangle, a reflex from Dario’s tutelage, lately traded for a sheepish laugh with Willow.


Motivations:


Justice: Ceaseless stalk for the syndicate that razed his family.


Redemption: War to scour White Fang’s corruption, resurrecting Ghira’s lost honor.


Survival: Refusal to let Mistral’s abyss—or anyone—claim him, now laced with a vow to protect Willow.


Backstory:
 Ernesto Fumo’s life began in the soot-choked slums of Mistral, where grime and want painted his early years. His parents, humble traders, scraped by in the city’s underbelly until a syndicate’s arson, at age 12, swallowed them in flames, leaving Ernesto with a milky-white left eye and a jagged scar mapping the fire’s ruin. As he clawed through the blaze’s wreckage, his Aura flared to life; a child reborn in cinders, he was pulled free by Dario Slate, a grizzled ex-Huntsman whose voice rasped like shattered stone. Dario took the orphan under his wing, pressing a fedora into his hands years later with a gruff, “For the road, kid,” shaping him into a survivor through rough, unyielding lessons. At 13, Ernesto entered Haven Academy, honing Obsidian Razor and Ash Veil into lethal crafts under Dario’s shadow. A prodigy cloaked in wariness, he forged a tight knot of trust with his team until, at 27, a mission crumbled under botched intel from Ozpin’s murky web. His team bled out in Mistral’s wilds; the treachery curdled his faith in the headmaster’s riddles. Abandoning the Huntsman fold, he turned rogue as Smoke PI, hunting his family’s killers through Mistral’s criminal maze, a blade unmoored from their rules. Early in his career, he rescued the Mistrali yakuza leader’s daughter from kidnappers seeking ransom, earning their gratitude and a ceremonial tanto as a token of honor. By 28, he fought beside Ghira Belladonna in the White Fang’s noble dawn, tracking lost Faunus and dragging SDC rot—bribes, beatings, buried lives—into the light, forcing reforms with blood and proof. But when Ghira stepped down, and Sienna and Adam twisted the Fang into a terror sect, Ernesto became their relentless pursuer, a hawk rending their blood-drenched wings to honor Ghira’s lost vision; his mask became a shield against their betrayal—later rallying Ghira’s voice to topple Jacques. Now 46, he straddles old scars and new battles. Roman Torchwick slips him Cinder’s secrets, which he feeds to Qrow, shunning Ozpin’s gilded snare after a failed lure with lien and promises; his “no” was a wall Qrow never challenged. Ironwood brands him a loose cannon, but Qrow’s silence holds. His feud with Viktor Gravelle, fueled by trafficking and dark pacts with Cinder and Salem, ties him tighter to the abyss he fights; each raid is a spark in a consuming war. A clandestine bond with Willow Schnee ignited in Atlas’s underbelly while he tracked SDC corruption tied to Viktor. A shared drink, during her rare escape from Jacques, spiraled into a hidden affair—solace for her, respite for him—veiled until Jacques’s brutality forced Ernesto’s hand. Orchestrating Jacques’s fall with Roman’s heists, Neo’s intel, Ghira’s rallies, and Lisa’s airwaves, he saved Willow and Whitley, sending them into hiding under Qrow’s guard. Surviving Jacques’s assassins in Vale and securing his arrest, Ernesto’s bond with Willow bloomed; coffee dates in Atlas evolved into love, and her CEO rise became a testament to their shared defiance.
Relationships:
 Allies:
Qrow Branwen (Best Friend):


Bond: Forged in a Grimm-torn swamp, sealed over a shared cigar as Qrow’s flask coughed its last drop.


Dynamic: “Smokey” and “Birdbrain” sling barbs like weathered scars; Qrow shields his blind left flank.


Role: Guards his identity from Ozpin and Ironwood, channels Roman’s Cinder intel.


Lisa Lavender (Contact):


Description: Razor-witted reporter, gaze cutting lies like his blade cuts Grimm.


Relationship: Trades leads for scoops, glimpsed him unmasked—gray streaks, jagged scar—locks it away.


History: Raw trysts ended with Willow’s rise.


Roman Torchwick (Informant):


Pact: Ironclad from a heist gone sideways—spared for a favor.


Role: Cracked lens into Cinder’s schemes, grits plans over cigar haze; strut grates, intel’s gold.


Trust: Knows the man behind the mask, keeps it close.


Neo (Tagalong):


Description: Roman’s mute shadow, pint-sized killer with a devil’s grin.


Bond: Illusions yanked him from a death trap, earning a nod; signs “one-eye” with a smirk, he tips his fedora.


Knowledge: Knows only “Smoke,” her silence her bond.


Mistrali Yakuza (Allies):


Origin: Earned their loyalty early in his career by rescuing their leader’s daughter from kidnappers seeking ransom.


Dynamic: A rare underworld alliance; they offer occasional intel and resources, respecting his autonomy.


Token: Gifted him a ceremonial tanto, a symbol of gratitude and a practical tool for his hunts.


Willow Schnee (Girlfriend):


Origin: Fragile flame sparked in Atlas’s shadows—refuge in his strength, balm against Jacques’s wrath.


Development: Affair born from a shared drink, severed trysts with Lisa, veiled until Jacques’s fist forced his hand.


Outcome: Razed Jacques’s world—exposed abuse, thwarted assassins—freed her to lead SDC as CEO; coffee dates grew into love, her “I love you” met with his “I know” and her playful smack on his shoulder, two fractured souls now whole.


Rivalries:
White Fang (Sienna/Adam):


Conflict: Hunted their bloody wake after Ghira stepped down.


Drive: Hawk clawing at their terrorist reign, fueled by a dream’s betrayal.


Tactic: Smoke a scourge they can’t grasp.


Cinder Fall (Via Roman):


Knowledge: Roman’s leaks paint her a flame-crowned phantom.


Position: Wraith in her blind spots, biding time with predator’s patience.


Goal: Her chaos a thread he’ll sever.


General Ironwood (Ozluminati):


Perception: Sees him as a rogue tethered to crooks, a liability spitting on order.


Tension: Hounds Qrow to unmask him, gets only silence.


Stance: Ernesto’s defiance a crack in Atlas’s iron world.


Jacques Schnee (Fallen Foe):


Trigger: Petty tyrant whose fist on Willow lit Ernesto’s fuse.


Conflict: Hired assassins to kill him and reclaim her and Whitley.


Resolution: Fell to Ernesto’s web of heists, rallies, and recordings, arrested in Atlas’s glare—a broken king undone by a wraith’s justice.


Viktor Gravelle, The Gravfather (Arch-Nemesis):


Origin: War ignited when Ernesto razed Viktor’s trafficking ring—tore captives from gravity-dust chains, torched profits.


Depth: Deepened by Viktor’s ties to Cinder and Salem, mirroring the syndicate rot that stole his family.


Clash: Truth against ambition, a personal vendetta sharpened by Remnant’s fate.


Impact:
 Ernesto’s underworld is a fractured sprawl he slashes apart—a solitary reaper cutting through criminal arteries, syndicates bleeding muscle, White Fang cells shattering, Viktor’s dominion buckling, and Jacques’s empire razed under his quiet fury. The tone is hushed terror—“smoke wraith” legends ripple through dive bars, a specter stalking Viktor’s turf most fiercely, his raids a chill wind through Mistral’s haze, now echoing in Atlas’s fall. His influence unshackles the exploited—Faunus murmur his name from Ghira’s days, Willow rises from his fire—dragging corruption into the open, but his vendetta with Viktor stains the streets darker, a personal war echoing into broader chaos. Weaknesses shadow him: his lone-wolf stride caps his reach, the blind left eye courts disaster—nearly fatal in Vale’s ambush—Roman’s allegiance wobbles, and Viktor’s cunning tightens the noose, threatening to choke the smoke before it can strike, though Willow’s love steadies his flame.

1jnxllu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jnxllu,Detailed hostel reviews of Bir because people wanted it,"All pictures on booking.com of each hostel was legit, all of them were quite clean and hygienic when I was there. I didn't take pictures thinking I will post them so they are just mostly views from the places.
For prices of each refer to the last post
Pics in order of discription 

I liked Chockling the best because of the calm and quite and everything in a walkable distance that I was interested in. Which were the monastery prayers and some workshops in deerpark and the yoga studio.
Landing site is also at walkable distance only.
However most people will not like that level of quite where noone in a hostel talks or parties and the conversations are generally around spirituality.

Destination Bir is properly in the village area away from all other 3 and landing sites. Again because I like solitude and silence I loved it. I was the only guest in the whole place except one more long term rental guy. 
There is a beautiful garden to sit in to work and read.
Rooms are well designed and have enough space to properly store my things and a great mirror which I missed in other places. Very clean and tidy and happy place for me. Best part is it has a washing machine so it's perfect for long stays to avoid paying a lot for laundry.
It comes with its own cons that the kitchen wasn't operational when I was there and as there is nothing around I was in a fix when I had nothing to eat or even tea or coffee between my meetings.but I made arrangements the next day with fruits and buying lunch and dinner before hand. Keeping energy drinks for my caffeine fix so that was that.

Zostel is famous and it's interiors and design is amazing,
But there are too many people it's always almost fully occupied with 8 and 10 bed dorms and swamps of people in common areas. Music playing around all the time. Which is great if you are not working like me.
I hated the place even though I was excited for it the most and it was my initial motivation to go to Bir altogether. I did meet people here but the conversations were pretty hollow it's mostly very bougie touristy people here instead of backpacking travellers who share their honest stories.
Though the guy at the cafe was really good at giving hidden gem recommendations and helpful in all ways.



The hostel stories has a great view of a stream and a peaceful outside but rooms are small and it markets itself as a party place so alot of times it is noisy and catering to different crowd. It's very near the landing site and good cafes like Avas and silver lining. 4 bed dorm should be the go to here.

I had one bad day where I was so fatigued I just wanted to cry, but it went away. Then yesterday morning when I woke up, I just felt SO PREGNANT. 

In the same way that describing first trimester nausea and how it is a full body and mind experience is hard, trying to describe the fatigue I’ve been hit with is also difficult. BUT i know y’all will know what I mean and I need to complain and hopefully there is some advive out there.

So I have actually been sleeping well ever since abandoning the first trimester (forever i might add, jesus h christ what a time). Even though I’ve been on sick leave the whole pregnancy, I have kept a good sleeping schedule. I actually fall asleep really fast around 10/10.30pm, and then I wake up at around 6-7am. I do wake up a couple times to pee, but I am so used to it now it doesn’t bother me. I also eat well finally. My sweet tooth has gone away, I’m back to eating what I ate before pregnancy and that’s usually healthy and filling meals. So imagine my suprise when I woke up yesterday feeling as if I’d been on a 2 week long bender.

It took me a solid 2 hours to feel human-ish again. I was starving, my stomach hurt in a weird way, I was extremely bloated, my vision was blurry and my brain was foggy. After breakfast, coffee and a shower I felt better, but then a few hours later my body sort of turned into cement. I felt extremely heavy, as if I had ran a marathon the day before. I wasn’t sleepy, it was just my body. I struggled to walk, i struggled to get up from the couch, it felt as if my brain didn’t understand what muscles to activate to do any sort of movement. I felt as if I had to manually walk, like actually focus on my legs going «left, right, left right». I went to bed super early, and just lied in bed watching desperate housewives while my boyfriend cuddled me. I wanted to cry, because just being alive was exhausting? My body didn’t actually hurt, but it still felt as if I was in pain? Almost that feeling when you have the flu, but no actual symptoms of being sick. Maybe similar to post-covid fatigue? My legs were litterally shaking when I tried walking down the stairs. 

I was hoping it was a fluke, but I woke up this morning feeling the same way. If this is my future for the next 13 weeks I might just die to be honest holy fuck",1,1743405644.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

There's multiple concern regarding my weirdly bodily response to particular exposure, mainly about Caffeine, spicy food (both from capsaicin and wasabi), and eyesight. I really wanted to hear your insight regarding my what-so-called condition i guess?

  
1. The first time i ever consumed caffeine during my college year (around the age of 18-19), i thought it could help me with keeping me awake the whole night because i wanted to study. Heh, what i ended up with is 9 hours deep good sleep. Until today, i still consume coffee whether black or instant and yet there is still no effect of caffeine on my body as it supposed to in which causing me a hard time to exercise as i also try multiple brand of pre workout recommended by the local gym that i visited in the past. Out of all pre workout i have taken, only 1 did the job in providing me energy outburst despite have no calories and no caffeine, the sad thing is that i forgot the brand name and it's hella expensive, around rm6 at that time per scoop (preferably not try to convert the exchange rate because you'll try to justify your point of view based on your currency. Just imagine that it's worth around 7-8 US dollar if you're a US citizen). I guess that's all the information regarding my concern of caffeine... next;

  
2. Spicy food, I'll try to make my information sharing a compact one. I'm a southeast asian, yet i have mediocre level of spicy tolerance (capsaicin tolerance to be accurate, yet again, different dishes influenced by their significant culture will have different types of spiciness as such as sudden intense spiciness, lingering one, intense capsicum flavor profile with strong spiciness etc...). Yet again, i've eaten tons of spicy food that surpassing the tolerance that i have, the issue is that most of the time, spicy food i eat is, it only spicy on the mouth, and it didn't feel much inside my guts. I don't feel any discomfort or burning sensation throughout my gastrointestinal track other than the anus itself. I tried to compared to the others but other people usually have the opposite condition where they had strong spicy tolerance yet they often facing tons of gastrointestinal condition as such as worsening stomach ulcer, bloody stool/diarrhea, abdominal cramping etc.. An example that i can give is Buldak 2x spicy noodles, i'm bawling when eating the ramen but i don't have gastrointestinal problem but my friend who have higher spicy tolerance, being scolded by the doctor for eating it as he had a fever and diarrhea later on.

  
3. Regarding wasabi, i've found out that wasabi spiciness comes from allyl isothiocyanate, spiciness that often describe as almost cleansing sensation that primarily affects the nose and sinuses. The thing is, the spicy sensation/profile i got from eating wasabi is as i'm being pricked by million very fine needle on my tongue instead of any form of nasal cleanse sensation. For additional information, the wasabi that i consumed is not the fake one but the authentic one, kinda burn my wallet tho from the expensiveness for that damn root.

  
4. Regarding the eyesight, my whole family have bad eyesight, my dad and my mom have long-sightedness, all of my older sister have long-sightedness, my older brother have short-sightedness, while me, the last child, have none. What is the probability for me to be born with such no eyesight issue?

  
Forgot to mention that i have no existing medical issues, current medication i take is Loratadine, 1 pill per day recommended doses but i just start taking it today because of didn't have enough sleep last night and i have strong allergies to pollen and dust (worsed condition that i had is headache, lose focus and runny nose like a damn tap water), never drink alcohol in my life, stop smoking but currently vape, never use any form of drug other than medicine. 

Additional health history that i require professionals is tonsilitis (wasn't cause by smoking, but smoking is what worsened it), chickenpox (when i was a kid, that's all. Don't know if this information is needed or not but i'll still gonna give it), tinnitus (i currently had it but very much didn't interrupt my current life, the worst that i had is when fall off my motorcycles and my left ear ringing very loud that i can't hear anything else. As far as i remember, the specialist said that the worsened ringing is caused by my nerves damages or something if i'm not mistaken and she gave me some sorts of nerves vitamin/medicine. The current level of tinnitus of mine is close to negligible because a whisper is louder than the ringing).

**Jovi Rosee, Head of Production of Rosee Studios, Employee of MultiVer Solutions, Head Writer and Executive Director of “The Exterminators (2141)”, Patient at Emory Hospital**  
*Three days, five hours after incident*

I blinked. My thoughts felt sluggish, like I was swimming through thick water. The last thing I remembered was—

The gun.

The gun, the flash, the *pain*.

The memory hit me all at once, and my hand instinctively flew to my chest, expecting warmth, wetness—*blood.*

But there was nothing.

I exhaled sharply. My voice came out hoarse. “So... am I dead?”

Jesse stared at me for a long moment. Then, he *laughed.*

Not the polite chuckle he used in boardrooms, or the smooth, knowing smirk he used when toying with someone in a negotiation. It was an honest, genuine laugh.

“Dead? No, Jovi, you’re very much alive.”

I blinked at him. My mind still felt slow, disconnected. “This doesn’t make sense. I should have a bullet in my chest and in my shoulder.”

Jesse gestured vaguely, and suddenly, the white void around us *shifted.* The space rippled, and images formed—flashes of hospital lights, of machines, of people moving in and out. And at the center of it all, *me.*

Lying unconscious in a hospital bed.

I swallowed. “Where am I?”

“Emory Hospital,” Jesse said smoothly. “Atlanta. You’ve been in a coma for three days.”

I felt another wave of disorientation, my mind trying to connect those words to my reality. “Three days,” I repeated, more to myself than to him.

Jesse nodded. “You suffered a pretty nasty concussion when you fell. The shots did some damage, but the paramedics stabilized you pretty fast, and the fine folks at Tulane Medical Center did the rest.”

I reached up, touching my head, as if I could feel the injury myself. The shooting was a haze, a mix of gunfire and pain and—

I closed my eyes for a second, trying to grab onto something, *anything* solid.

Jesse watched me carefully. “Don’t push too hard. You’ll remember in time.”

I exhaled, still struggling to fully understand. “Then what *is* this? A dream?”

Jesse smiled. “Sort of. You and I are both hooked up to an experimental brain scanning device. It’s reconstructing and recording your memories, helping your brain recover faster, and allowing me to view your memories. The reason we’re having this little chat? Your memory of the shooting started bleeding into your other memories, and, well…” He gestured vaguely. “That triggered an error that let you see *my* memories.""

The conversation with Ignacio…

I frowned. “I saw something. You and your father...”

Jesse shrugged, completely unfazed. “Yeah, that was *not* supposed to happen, but don’t worry. I ran a protocol to keep you from experiencing any weird side effects. You’re basically in a controlled dream-state now.”

I swallowed, still feeling like I was missing something important. Then a new thought hit me.

“The shooter,” I said suddenly. “Did he-” I stopped.

The memory was jagged, fractured. I remembered seeing the gun. I remembered rushing forward. And I *remembered* the pain. But between that and my argument with Danny… nothing.

Jesse studied my expression and sighed. “I figured you wouldn’t remember everything yet. You took a pretty bad hit to the head. The cameras at the con showed that you had a conversation with the shooter before he attacked you.”

I clenched my jaw. “What did I say to him?”

Jesse’s expression darkened slightly. “We were hoping you could tell us.”

I looked at him, frustrated. “I *don’t* remember.”

Jesse gave a slow nod. “That’s what we expected. Whatever he said to you… it’s locked away for now.”

I rubbed my forehead, willing myself to pull something forward, but all I got was a dull ache, still trying to wrap my head around everything. “Okay… so how does this work, exactly? The whole ‘viewing memories’ thing?”

Jesse smirked, but there was a hint of patience behind it, like a teacher amused by a student struggling with an obvious answer. “It’s pretty simple—well, as simple as experimental cutting-edge brain-interface technology can be.” He took a step back, gesturing vaguely around us, as if the void itself was part of the explanation.

“The scanner uses a laser to scan an area of the cerebral cortex that stores memories, known as the Robinson area,” he began, pointing at his head, “and reconstructs the data into a simulation within an external computer. Basically, it lets us *see* memories—either your own or someone else’s—by translating the neural data into something more easily readable.”

I blinked. “So you’re saying that if I remember something, this machine can pull it up like a… like a video?”

Jesse nodded. “More or less. The scanner doesn’t just replay the memory inside your head—it builds it outside, letting us step *into* it. That’s why I was able to see your memories of you with your family, and why you saw mine from years ago.”

I folded my arms, still processing. “And the image of me in the hospital bed? That was… your memory?”

Jesse’s smirk widened slightly. “Bingo. That was from my own perspective from when I began to view your memories—me standing in your hospital room, watching over you.” He shrugged. “Since you were unconscious at the time, you wouldn’t have a memory of that moment. So I used my memories to explain where you are.

I glanced around, half expecting to see the hospital room reappear, but the white void remained empty. “So… if we wanted, we could watch any memory?”

Jesse’s smirk faded slightly, replaced by something more measured. “Yes and no. It’s not quite like accessing a database. Memories aren’t perfect recordings—they’re messy, emotional, full of gaps. The scanner reconstructs them as best it can, but it’s still based on how you perceived them.”

I exhaled, my mind racing with possibilities. “So, how can you trust it? If a memory changes every time you remember it, why trust pulled up memories at all?”

Jesse sighed, shifting his weight slightly. “The Robinson Area, the part of your cerebral cortex we’re scanning, stores the rawest form of memory. Even when you can’t consciously recall something, it’s still in there, filed away. Think of it like a compressed file. Your brain stores the memory in a very reduced form in the Robinson Area, and uses what's stored to reconstruct the memories when you recall them. It's why people remember things differently every time they remember them, but still *remember*. The system does the same thing as your brain does when reconstructing memories… but without emotion, without the context of other memories.""

That sounded right, but then again, I was a Dramatic Arts major in college. I know nothing about neuroscience or anything to do with something like this, so if Jesse was lying or simply incorrect, I'd have no way of knowing.

Jesse sighed, his voice shifting into something a little more reassuring. “Look, Jovi, I know it’s frustrating, but you just woke up—*sort of*—and you’ve been through hell. Give it time. The scanner’s working to piece everything together, and you’re already showing signs of recall. We’ll get there.”

I exhaled. “So the machine’s scanning that part of my brain, pulling pieces from it to build a simulation of the conversation.”

Jesse pointed at me with a grin. “Now you’re getting it.”

I hesitated. “But if the scanner can reconstruct my memories, why haven’t you already pulled up the conversation? Shouldn’t we *know* what happened by now?”

Jesse exhaled through his nose. “Because forcing a traumatic memory to the surface—before your brain is ready—can cause serious damage.”

I tensed slightly. “Damage? Like what?”

“Like re-traumatizing you. Like making the memory *worse* instead of clearer.” His voice was calm, but firm. “Worst-case scenario? Your brain reacts *violently* to the forced recall. You could seize. You could lose the memory *permanently.* You could even suffer permanent neurological damage if we push too hard, too fast.”

I let out a slow breath, resisting the urge to rub my temples. “So I just have to… wait?”

“Not exactly.” Jesse gave me a reassuring look. “You’re already making progress. The fact that you even *realized* something was missing was a good sign. We’ll get the full picture soon enough. What’s the *last* thing you remember before the shooting?”

I exhaled, rubbing my temple as I tried to reach through the fog in my mind. The pieces were scattered, disjointed, but something was there—a sliver of something solid, something real.

“There was… an argument,” I said slowly, my voice uncertain at first. “On the train.”

Jesse’s brow lifted slightly. “The train?”

I nodded, the memory coming into focus. “Yeah. The underwater train from Covington to New Orleans.”

The details started filtering back. The smooth hum of the maglev tracks. The way the train shifted from land to water, the gentle pressure change as it submerged beneath the waves, cutting through the Gulf toward the underwater city. The way the image of New Orleans shimmered beneath the surface, distorted by the Superdome.

And the argument.

It was loud. Tense.

I swallowed. “I don’t remember *why* I was arguing,” I admitted. “But I remember feeling—angry. Frustrated. Like I was betrayed. Hurt.”

Jesse tilted his head slightly. “Is there anything you remember saying?”

I furrowed my brow, struggling to pull the details forward. It was like grasping at smoke. “I—” I stopped, shaking my head. “I don’t know. I *almost* have it, but then it just—slips away.”

Jesse didn’t look frustrated, which was good, because I *was.* Instead, he just nodded. “That’s normal,” he said. “Your brain is still processing. You’re getting closer, though.”

I let out a slow breath. “So what now?”

Jesse crossed his arms. “Now? We try to reconstruct that memory first. The argument. The train ride. If we can bring that back, it might give us a clearer path to the shooting itself.”

I exhaled, my fists clenching at my sides. I still felt like I was missing something *big,* something just out of reach.

*One hour, forty-four minutes until incident*

The rhythmic hum of the train filled the cabin, the steady pressure shift in my ears reminding me that we were descending beneath the surface of Lake Pontchartrain. The overhead lights cast a soft glow over the curved walls, giving the space an almost cozy feeling despite the deep blackness outside the window.

Flurin flipped through the tourist guide in his lap, scanning the pages with idle curiosity. “Did you know that the name ‘Superdome’ used to refer to a stadium?”

His voice had that familiar, thoughtful tone—half reading, half absorbing the history as if trying to make sense of it all.

I turned toward him, ready to respond, but before I could, Max beat me to it.

She didn’t even glance up from her holopad. “Yeah, that was *before* sea levels rose and they realized the city would either have to be abandoned or have even more levees built to stop the rising floodwaters, and expanded every few years. But then someone asked, ‘Hey, why don’t we just build a massive dome over the city?’” She smirked, leaning back in her seat. “Oh, folks laughed at first, but then they really *thought* about it. The Laveau Superdome has protected New Orleans ever since, even from the Satellite Wars and the Battle of Earth.”

I huffed out a quiet chuckle. It was one thing to read about it in a history book, but another to hear it from someone who had actually *lived* in the city. Max had spent three years here for college—definitely more experience than my own, which mostly amounted to playing a role in a play about Hurricane Katrina in high school.

Flurin flipped another page, nodding along. “Humans *do* have a habit of turning the impossible into the practical.”

I smirked, stretching my legs out under the table. “That’s a polite way of calling us stubborn.”

Flurin gave a small, amused snort. “You *are* stubborn.”

Max smirked, but didn’t argue the point.

The train rocked gently, the sensation of movement shifting slightly as we continued our descent. Outside the window, the darkness of the lake swallowed everything, only the occasional glint of artificial lights alongside the underwater track breaking through the gloom.

The placid hum of the train was suddenly interrupted by my phone ringing. Without thinking, I reached for the phone, the screen lighting up in my hand. I didn’t even bother looking at the number—it wasn’t uncommon for calls to come in from unknown contacts, especially in this business.

I answered.

“Hello?”

A voice—cool, measured, but laced with something darker—answered on the other end.

“Jovi Rosee.”

My heart skipped a beat. Even without a proper greeting, I knew who it was.

“Your Highness?” I asked, instinctively lowering my voice as if I were suddenly being pulled into something important.

“Yes,” she replied smoothly, her tone never betraying even the slightest hint of emotion. “I need you to check the number you’re receiving this call from. It’s vital.”

I furrowed my brow but did as she asked, quickly glancing down at the screen. A +35 country code stared back at me.

“Multaverde?” I murmured. “You’re calling from Multaverde?” If Princess Jan was calling me on a secure line directly from Osca Hall, it *was* something important.

She paused for a moment, then spoke with purpose. “Correct. I’m about to send you a text file containing vital information regarding *The Exterminators* and the leak.” Her voice dropped slightly, the words now laced with a more serious edge. “You need to see this.”

My phone buzzed again, and a new notification appeared—URGENT: READ IMMEDIATELY.

I hesitated, feeling the weight of something unseen pressing down on me. But my hands moved automatically, opening the file before my mind could second-guess.

I skimmed the first line—and felt my blood run cold.

**“Daniel Foxton is the leak.”**

The file was meticulously detailed—too detailed to be fabricated, too thorough to be anything but the truth. It outlined how Danny had provided a Social Media intern with the log-in credentials for an encrypted drive, a drive containing a vast amount of internal data on *Rosee Productions.* The intern had used those credentials to access the drive and leak the clip from *The Exterminators* panel.

The file detailed how Danny had been aware of the leak before it became public, how he had deleted emails that could have tied him to the leak after it came out. Evidence that showed he had not only been complicit but had actively hidden his tracks.

I felt a cold rush of disbelief and betrayal. Danny—the same person I’d known for years, the one who had always been by my side, guiding me, advising me. The one I had trusted with the truth, with everything—I had no idea.

There it was, in black and white—correspondence logs, internal timestamps, proof that Danny had systematically erased any traces of his involvement.

I clenched my jaw, my fingers tightening around my phone.

This wasn’t a mistake. This couldn’t have been some accident, some misunderstanding.

Danny had done this.

“Mr. Rosee,” Jan’s voice came through the phone again, smooth, patient. “Do you understand what you’re reading?”

I swallowed hard, staring at the words on my screen, my vision blurring slightly from the sheer *weight* of it all.

“This… this can’t be real,” I muttered under my breath, as if saying it out loud could somehow make it untrue.

Jan’s voice, smooth as ever, came through the line again. “I suggest you confront him about it. The longer you wait, the more damage this does to the show, to the team, to *all* of us.”

I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself, but my heart was pounding in my chest. The weight of it all was crushing. This was bigger than I had ever anticipated.

“I’ll handle it,” I said, my voice low, steady. “Thank you.”

“Just remember,” Jan added, her tone turning almost *too* sweet, “This information is only useful if you act on it.”

Before I could respond, the line clicked dead. The phone in my hand suddenly felt heavy, the silence in the train car suddenly deafening.

The train rumbled softly beneath us, the distant hum of voices in the main cabin fading as I led Danny toward an isolated car. It wasn’t hard—he followed without a word, sensing the weight of what was coming. I closed the door behind us, shutting out the rest of the world.

Danny leaned against the window, arms crossed, waiting. His expression was unreadable, but there was tension in his shoulders, in the way he held himself just a little too still.

I took a slow breath. “I need you to tell me the truth.”

His gaze flicked to mine. “About what?”

I lifted my phone, the file still open, the words staring back at me like a scar. “Is this true?”

Danny didn’t look at the screen. His jaw clenched slightly. “What exactly am I supposed to be confirming?”

“You gave a MultiVer intern log-in credentials to an encrypted drive that contained sensitive information about the studio. The intern you gave them to accessed it and leaked the clip. Then you found out, erased the evidence, and let the situation spiral.”

Danny inhaled sharply through his nose. Then, to my surprise, he *nodded.*

“Yes, I gave them the credentials. But not like that.” His voice was steady, but there was an edge beneath it. “Not maliciously. Not purposefully. I gave them access for *work,* Jovi. They needed access to files, and I—” He stopped, shaking his head. “I didn’t think twice about it. If they leaked something, that was *never* my intention.”

I studied him, my fingers tightening around my phone. “Jan says the proof is right here. Are you telling me she faked all of this?”

Danny scoffed. “You tell me. Do you think I would *actually* try to sabotage *you?* To sabotage the *show?*”

I opened my mouth, but the words caught in my throat.

Because the truth was, I *didn’t* know anymore.

“You came up with the strategy to handle the leak,” I said slowly. “Was that just damage control? Or were you saving your own skin?”

Danny exhaled sharply, rubbing his temple. “Both,” he admitted. “Alright? Both. I panicked. I didn’t know how bad it looked until it was already too late, and I tried to *fix* it. But I swear to you, Jovi, *it was an accident.*”

I shook my head, trying to process it all, but the weight of the last few days—hell, the last *two years*—was pressing in fast.

Danny’s voice dropped, suddenly heavy with frustration. “None of this would have even happened if you had just *told me* about the damn scene when you made the decision two years ago.”

I froze.

Danny wasn’t yelling, but his voice cut through me sharper than a shout could have.

I swallowed hard. “That’s not the point right now.”

“It *is* the point,” Danny shot back. “That’s how we *got* here, Jovi! One secret led to another, and another, until now you’re standing here asking me if I *intentionally* leaked a clip just to screw you over.”

I took a slow breath, forcing my voice to stay steady. “I think it would be best if you resigned after the convention tour is over.”

Danny blinked. The tension in his body shifted from anger to something else—something bitter. “That’s it?” He let out a short, humorless laugh. “Six years and that's it? You’re really siding with *corporate* over me?”

I clenched my jaw, my patience wearing thin.

I had spent *years* trusting Danny, believing that no matter what, we had each other’s backs. But when I needed him most, when I needed him to *be honest with me*, I got half-truths and damage control.

I met his gaze, my voice calm but sharp as a knife.

“Look, in this case, it's either malice or incompetence, and we don't have room for either. Besides, MultiVer Solutions has been more reliable than *you* have.”

Danny sucked in a breath, and I barely had a second to brace before the argument truly began.

The words between us turned heated, sharp, like swinging blades. Accusations, frustrations, *years* of built-up resentment all came spilling out at once.

~~And suddenly, I~~ *~~needed~~* out.

~~I~~ *~~wanted~~* ~~out.~~

*Three days, five hours after incident*

The memory fractured, the train car dissolving around me, reality slipping away like water through my fingers.

And then—white again. The void. Quiet, open, still.

Jesse was already there. He stood a few feet away with his hands in his pockets, head tilted slightly, expression somewhere between apology and concern.

""I'm sorry,"" he said quietly. “I know it couldn’t have been easy to go through that again.”

I didn’t answer right away. I just stood there, letting the last pieces of the memory dissolve from the edges of my mind like fog in morning heat. The echo of my voice, of Danny’s voice, still clung to me—sharpened, exhausted, final.

“It wasn’t,” I admitted eventually. “But… it was real. I needed to remember.”

Jesse nodded once. No smugness. No clever quips. Just understanding.

“That fight,” I continued, exhaling slowly, “it lasted the whole ride. We didn’t speak again. I sat by myself the rest of the way.” I rubbed at the back of my neck, the weight of the memory clinging to me. “When we got to New Orleans, the others went on that little sightseeing trip Max set up, a graveyard tour or something, I don’t even remember. I skipped it. Went straight to the convention.

Jesse shifted slightly, his brows furrowed just enough to show concern without condescension. “You were carrying a lot.”

I gave a bitter half-laugh. “Still am.”

A moment of silence passed between us. Then, Jesse’s tone softened again. “You okay to continue?”

I hesitated, just for a second. I was tired, yes. Frustrated. Hurt. But under all of that, there was something else growing now—*clarity.*

The pieces were coming together.

I met Jesse’s gaze and nodded.

“Yes. Let’s keep going.”

**Jovi Rosee, Head of Production of Rosee Studios, Employee of MultiVer Solutions, Head Writer and Executive Director of “The Exterminators (2141)”**  
*Eight minutes, forty-two seconds until incident*

The air was thick with the smell of powdered sugar and chicory coffee. The clatter of trays, the gentle hum of conversations, and the sharp *crunch* of golden pastry breaking under my teeth filled my senses.

I was seated alone at a small corner table near the convention snack bar—one of those temporary, polished-up stations set up for the con, decorated with vintage posters of New Orleans and vaguely French Quarter–style trim.

But what mattered was the *food*.

Beignets—fresh, *piping hot*—the kind only New Orleans could get right. Café Du Monde style. Crispy, doughy perfection, buried under a snowdrift of powdered sugar.

I took another bite, letting the flavor briefly drown the buzzing in my head.

“Is it as good as it looks, or am I just hungry?”

The voice came from beside me—low, smooth, familiar in a way that tickled the back of my memory.

I turned.

The man who sat down beside me had aged just a little since the last time I’d seen him in person, but he still had that casually handsome face that came with professional lighting and the right kind of agent.

Carter Statler.

I blinked. “Carter. Wow. Hey.”

He smiled and reached for a napkin, swiping a bit of stray sugar from the edge of my tray. “Didn’t expect to run into you here, Jonavan. Last I heard, you were on a whirlwind tour of dramatic redemption arcs and press junkets.”

I chuckled lightly, brushing sugar from my fingers and ignoring the fact he called me by a name I hated. “Yeah, well. I needed a break. This is the quietest place I’ve found all day.”

“Beignets’ll do that. Can't speak when your mouth's full of fried dough,” he said, then leaned back slightly. “So… I figured I’d ask. That actor you ended up casting as Morgan? Donald Lockhart, right? How hard was it to do all the CGI? He looks *amazing* in the show. Seamless.”

I paused mid-bite, lowering the pastry. “You mean Daunir Lockhart?”

Carter blinked, his expression blank. “Sorry... *Daunir* Lockhart, right. Yeah. How many passes in post did it take to Arxur-ify him?”

I stared at him for a beat. “Didn't you know? He *is* Arxur.”

Carter didn’t react right away. He just blinked once. “Seriously?”

“Seriously,” I said. “We were filming in Savannah. The theater we were using for the second unit stuff had a local production of *The Drowsy Chaperone* running on the other side of the building. I saw Daunir playing Aldolfo onstage. I was hooked in the first five minutes.”

Carter looked at me like I’d just offered him raw meat on a cocktail napkin, which happened to Daunir during one of our shoots in Atlanta. “You cast an *actual* Arxur? On purpose?”

I didn’t answer right away.

He shook his head slightly, jaw tight. “Jonavan… with everything that’s happened? With what they've done?”

My spine stiffened a little. “Mr. Lockhart's from the Archives. Born before Betterment and the Federation’s manipulation. He was frozen for two hundred years. He didn’t do any of *that.*”

Carter didn’t blink. “And how exactly do you know that? Because he *said* so?” He leaned in slightly, voice lowering. “You know every Arxur says they’re from the Archives now, right? It’s, like, *the* golden ticket for sympathy. What was the name of that one case? Ristal, right? Upstate New York. Said she was from the Archives to get into that scholarship program. Turns out she’d been working on a cattle farm her whole life.”

I felt the pit form in my stomach, slow and cold.

“That’s not Daunir,” I said firmly. “He’s been *vetted.* Not just by us, but by the UN, by MultiVer, by half a dozen independent agencies. He’s the real thing.”

Carter’s eyes narrowed, but he leaned back, raising his hands slightly as if to say *hey, I’m just asking.* “Alright. Just… seems like a big risk. Especially with a character like Morgan.”

I stared at him for a long moment. “Maybe the biggest risk is not giving people the chance to prove they’ve changed. Or that they were never part of the problem to begin with.”

Carter didn’t respond.

And in the silence that followed, the powdered sugar didn’t taste quite as sweet.

I took a sip of water, hoping it would wash down the sourness now settling in my mouth- not from the beignet, but from the conversation.

Carter was still watching me, his expression cool, unreadable.

I didn’t have anything left to say. Not anything that wouldn’t tip this conversation into something uglier. And honestly? I wasn’t in the mood to fight someone’s fear masquerading as skepticism.

Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a familiar figure standing across the convention floor, near the *Exterminators* panel stage.

Regal posture. Calm confidence. A neatly trimmed beard. Even here, out of place in a crowd of costumed superfans and LED-lit chaos, he was unmistakable.

King Ignacio II of Multaverde.

I didn’t hesitate.

“Well,” I said, standing and brushing the powdered sugar from my palms, “it’s been good seeing you, Carter. But I’ve got someone I need to catch up with.”

He gave a short, noncommittal nod. “Sure.”

I turned before he could say anything else and walked away, weaving through the crowd, leaving the snack bar—and the weight of that conversation—behind.

As I approached, Ignacio turned slightly, already aware of me before I reached him.

“Jovi Rosee,” he said, his tone light. “I was wondering if you’d find your way here.”

I smiled. “And miss the main event? Not a chance.”

~~I heard Jesse’s voice, distant and echoing like a thought I hadn’t quite formed myself:~~

**“Let’s move forward a little bit.”**

~~Then a chime, something mechanical and soft, and a strange, shimmering shift in the air around me.~~

**\[Fast-Forwarding Transcript: Three Minutes, Eighteen Seconds\]**

~~It was~~ *~~jarring~~*.

~~Not like skipping ahead in a video. Not really. It was more like blinking and realizing someone had cut ten minutes from the middle of your life and pasted the ends back together. I still~~ *~~felt~~* ~~like I was in the moment, still~~ *~~aware~~* ~~of everything, but the in-between was gone, like memory slippage with intent behind it.~~

~~And just like that, I was back in the middle of the memory.~~

Daunir. Ignacio. Astel. The crowd’s hum.

And then-

“Jovi-” Ignacio had just turned his head when I saw him. *Statler.*

Moving with purpose. Cutting through the crowd.

Gun in hand.

My brain didn’t even process it before my body did—I lunged. ~~But just like before,~~ I was too slow.

CRACK.

The sound shattered the moment.

And just as I reached for him, the world tore apart again.

The memory collapsed around me.

Jovi Rosee, Head of Production of Rosee Studios, Employee of MultiVer Solutions, Head Writer and Executive Director of “The Exterminators (2141)”, Patient at Emory Hospital  
Three days, six hours after incident

White.

Back in the void.

Jesse was already there.

And he was *furious*.

“*It was him,*” he said, pacing, practically vibrating with rage. “It was *Statler.* Carter freaking Statler.” He spun on his heel, gesturing wildly. “Do you have *any* idea what I’ve been worried about for the last three days?”

I opened my mouth, but he wasn’t really asking. He was unloading.

“I thought this was a political attack,” Jesse snapped. “I thought it was about Dad, or MultiVer, or the *Satellite Wars,* or some shadow war I hadn’t seen coming. We were bracing for civil unrest. For sabotage. For a media campaign.”

He stopped, his voice low now. Bitter.

""But *that’s* all it was. Not some conspiracy, not a political statement, not even a hit against my father or MultiVer or the Sapient Coalition or some darn ideological movement.” He ran both hands through his hair. “I spent days thinking we were at the center of something—some operation, some goddamn *agenda.*”

He let out a sharp breath, almost a laugh. “But no. It was an actor—*a spehing voice actor!*—mad about losing a secondary role in a TV show! He brought a gun into a packed convention and almost killed you, injured my dad, and killed himself on the convention floor because he didn't get a callback!""

I stood there for a moment, processing it all, and then, without meaning to, I let out a dry, humorless chuckle.

“Jesse…” I met his eyes. “You’ve been around television long enough to know better.”

He narrowed his eyes. “What do you mean?”

I gave a tired shrug. “I means life isn’t like TV. It’s not fiction. There’s not always a deeper meaning. No shadowy puppet masters. No great conspiracy. No poetic irony.” I let out a small, hollow laugh. “This is real life, and in real life, sometimes people do dumb shit for dumb reasons.”

I looked away, the weight of it settling in. “In fact… that’s usually *why* they do dumb shit.”

Jesse finally stopped pacing, letting the silence stretch between us as the last traces of the shattered memory settled into the white void. He looked at me—tired now, the fire in his eyes tempered to embers.

Then he spoke, his voice quieter, more measured.

“You’re almost done, Jovi.”

I blinked, unsure what he meant at first.

He gestured vaguely to the world around us—this simulated realm of light and memory. “The restoration. You’ve been hooked up to this machine for two days. But your brain’s stabilized. The damage is… minimal. Little to no permanent physical or neurological trauma. When you wake up, the doctors are going to call it a *miracle.*”

A humorless smile crossed his face. “And technically, they won’t be wrong.”

I swallowed, not sure what to feel. Relief? Gratitude? Fear?

“But,” Jesse continued, taking a slow step toward me, “this isn’t over.”

Something in his tone shifted again—just a shade, but I felt it in my chest.

“You’re only a third of the way through this season,” he said, voice calm but heavy with implication. “And the show—*your* show—is just the tip of something much bigger.” He met my gaze, more serious than I’d ever seen him. “You nearly died for this cause, Jovi. And I think it’s about time you knew what cause you nearly died for.”

The air between us felt denser now. My heart was beating faster again, though I couldn’t explain why.

“But not yet.” Jesse’s voice softened. “Not today.”

He gave me a small smile—not the salesman’s grin, not the corporate charm. Just something real.

“Today, you rest. You wake up. You talk to your family. You see your friends. You let them be glad you’re still here.”

I nodded, slow and uncertain, the words sinking in like a stone.

“You’ve done enough for now,” he said gently. “But when you, and I, are ready... we’ll talk.”

The white around us began to dim.

And for the first time, I felt the pull of waking.

Transcript of Phone Conversation Between Jesse James Multin and HRH Princess Martha Jane Canary Multin  
July 11th, 2141

\[Phone ringing…\]

\[Automated Operator:\] Hello! Thank you for calling MultiVer Peachtree Plaza. Please select from the following options: Press 1 for–

\[Jan Multin:\] Confirm Caller ID. Confirm Voice Print: *Seminare debemus.*

\[Automated Operator:\] Confirmation received. Hello, Miss Multin. Your brother will be with you shortly.

\[ringing\]

\[Jesse Multin:\]  Talk to me.

\[Jan:\] I saw the final report.

\[Jesse:\] And?

\[Jan:\] There’s something I think you missed. Page six. The weapon used in the shooting– a Jordi-56 pocket pistol manufactured by MultiVer Arms, seized by MVPS as company property.

\[Jesse:\] Jordi-56… Ah, *crab-apples.*

\[Jan:\] Officially, MVPS told the New Orleans Police Department it was a legacy prototype. One of the few produced just before the Satellite Wars, never issued en masse, quietly shelved once the war ended.

\[Jesse:\] And unofficially…

\[Jan:\] Very much still in production. Limited runs. Off-ledger. Specifically made for MVPS’ secret field teams.

\[Jesse:\] Designed for stealth entry. Bypasses metal detectors, x-ray scanners, even close-range pat-downs.

\[Jan:\] *And* fires custom-tooled SLAP rounds… Not exactly a weapon designed for defense…

\[Pause.\]

\[Jesse:\] Someone *had to* have given him that weapon.

\[Jan:\] From inside MVPS. A contact in one of the black ops units, almost certainly. That kind of hardware doesn’t get “lost.” It gets delivered.

\[Jesse:\] Any chance he got it on the black market? We just happened to miss one that fell into the wrong hands by coincidence?

\[Jan:\] Unlikely. The J-56 contains an anti-theft failsafe that will melt the internal components and render it useless should the holder activate it, and it was activated shortly after the news broke.

\[Jesse:\] Can the self-destruct signal be traced?

\[Jan:\] Negative. The signal’s anonymized, to ensure agents destroy their weapon should they lose it, instead of hiding they’ve lost it out of embarrassment or fear of punishment. “Just culture,” and so forth.

\[Jesse:\]  So someone wanted him to make the shot. Someone trusted him to do it.

\[Jan:\] Or to die trying. If that’s the case, they got their wish...

\[Pause.\]

\[Jan:\] I’ll start pulling Statler’s activity—Social media, forums, web searches, private messages. See who he was talking to. What he was seeing. 

\[Jesse:\] You think he was talking to someone?

\[Jan:\] More like someone was talking to *him.* Whispering in his ear. Feeding his resentment. Making him feel like it was righteous. Like it wasn’t about losing a role—it was about making a point.

\[Jesse:\] Make sure it’s clean, Jan. Quiet. We need bad publicity as much as we need uncertainties within MVPS. 

\[Jan:\] …Which is to say, not at all. If there’s a rot in MVPS, I’ll find it. How's Dad?

\[Jesse:\] Brought him up to speed on the situation. Recovery’s going well. He’ll walk again, but he needed a full knee replacement. That bullet pulverized everything.

\[Jan:\] And he’s still not rattled?

\[Jesse:\] A bit, but as he put it, “I got through a broken neck, I’ll get through this.” He said one other thing: stay the course. Don’t let the government sniff around what we can’t explain. Keep the optics clean.

\[Jan:\] So Skalgan Sunrise is still a go?

\[Jesse:\] Full steam. Statler's grudge ultimately means nothing, but we need to find his source fast. If someone inside MVPS handed Statler that weapon, then they have the ability to ruin everything we've been working towards in the past five years.

\[Jan:\] And Jovi?

\[Jesse:\] Came to three hours ago. Don’t think they recognized the gun. I told them they’d learn the truth. But not yet.

\[Pause.\]

\[Jan:\] You okay?

\[Jesse:\] Honestly? No.

\[Jan:\] Me neither.

1jnxjcx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jnxjcx,Coffee machine SMPS only provides 0.8v,"A friend got back from vacation and and plugged back in his electronics. The coffee machine (Gaggia Carezza Deluxe) doesn't work ever since.
I've tried measuring everything I could, but no success. I have only found the capacitor discharge resistor to be killed (open circuit instead of 1MΩ), and that indeed raises some question marks (over voltage)..

The SMPS controller is a LNK304DN, which would be the only part I couldn't test. There is no visible damage.

I've tried feeding the circuit 3v3 over the serial interface but the was no movement, no lights. I've then tried with 5v and the pressure actuator moves about 5-10 degrees every time. That's all. No other current consumption. The front board (SPST microswitches + leds + pressure gauge) communicates with the power/controller board through the wide gray ribbon cable. The circuit is also missing a diode (BZW06-376B) that I removed to test, but I don't have the appropriate tester for that (it is in series with the triac)

It's been pretty good.. usually roast a couple lbs at a time, put a few 1/2lb to 1lb of beans in freezer and let one sit in the bag a couple days. I use the generic sealed bags with the gas flap/holes. I reuse them though.. I dont put fresh roasted in and use my sealer to seal them. I tried that and noticed no difference in that or just reusing bags that have the press seal on it already and put in freezer. I typically dump around 1lb in my grinder hopper (Ceado E5P) at a time, which lasts 3 to 5 days give or take a couple. I am looking to move to a single dose process soon, been eye balling the Eureka Oro Mignon Pro for a while now.. they seem to have pretty low to 0 retention, updated dials, etc.

At any rate.. coffee definitely has gone up. What I paid $108 for 3 months ago is now $135. That's about what.. 20% to 25% increase. DAYUM. That's a big jump!

So I figure.. can I shop around and buy a 55lb bag instead of the 20lb to save a little? Seems 55lbs go for $5.50 to $6.50 or so per lb at that size. I typically order a 20lb bag and takes about 3 to 4 months to roast it all.. so a 55lbs will last me closer to a year.

So.. anyone have a good 55lb green bean specifically to roast to espresso with low acidity that is not fruity/chocolatey? If so.. where are you buying from that ships to house and isnt ridiculous in price to ship.

I do enjoy the Sweet Marias beans very much. Typically make a coffee with oat milk, little bit of caramel, 4 shots of espresso. Or sometimes just an Americano. Both taste great. But they only offer 20lb bags, but also wanted to see if maybe there is another option that we might end up liking more. I vaguely recall some italian coffee we had some time back that was pretty good, but also seems Brazilian beans are good for espresso as well?

Anyway.. interested in looking at 55lb to save a $1 or $2 per lb overall if possible and offer a rich low acid good flavor for espresso drinks.

Here's what I've experienced -
No overwhelming sense of clarity, (I was under the impression that one day this would come, it hasn't yet)
I've lost my love for coffee, (I loved coffee, I loved the ritual, the taste, it's now gone)
I'm sleeping more (like an extra hour on average a night)
I'm tired, all the time (I get regular bloods for a health condition, my blood work is fine, my diet is healthy and varied, I exercise)
I no longer have regular bowel movements (I used to go once a day, easy. Now I'm lucky if I'm once every 2. I'm bloated, I'm sluggish, and when I do go, it's an event)

I feel fine in myself, and I enjoy that my day isn't a rollercoaster of ups and downs of energy (it just never really picks up), but what's going on?? Are the people that rave about kidding themselves or am I the outlier?

I'm 22/F, living in Cali, just looking for some fun folks to DM and kill some time with. Please don't message though if you're gonna do 1-3 words at a time. I'd like an actual conversation.  
  
Best way to get my attention is via a DM. I'm likely not gonna be checking replies/notifications on this post.  
  
Hobbies of mine include:  
Video Games - Recently beat Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077, Veilguard, and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. Now I'm about 20ish hours into AC Shadows and loving it.  
  
Horror Movies - Horror is life. Especially a lot of the older stuff. Not to say that new stuff can't be good too, though, because it certainly can. Recent obsessions are the Terrifier and Smile series.  
  
Music - I lean heavily towards rock and metal, but I'll listen to almost anything. Angus McSix is my favorite band, it's power metal. I'm always open to new suggestions. Jamming out of a lot of 80's rock lately, as well.  
  
Also a big (American) football fan, if anyone out there would like to talk about that.

During IVF I told two close friends. I woke up this morning to someone who I barely know, from a different country having messaged to say ‘I heard you’re pregnant’. It could be either one of my friends that I completely trusted with this news who let the news out, the person used to join us for coffee etc but only for a few months before she moved away so not at all in our close circle.

I feel so upset and hurt by this, not only should it be my news to share but I asked on numerous occasions for them to keep it to themselves as it’s so so early and anything could happen, and they promised they would. 

I also wonder that if someone in a totally different country who we barely ever speak to knows, who else has my ‘friend’ told. Im now sat here running through a list of people she may have told as well, and wondering if she’s just told them about the pregnancy or about my inferentially struggles too. It feels horrible that someone would do this.

Generally, I don't get ill very often, like maybe once every couple of years.  Back in October (flying home from Girona, in fact) I caught Covid for the first time.  It wasn't too bad, off the bike maybe 10 days.

Then, 3 weeks back, I woke with slight nasal congestion, but the type that clears as you get up, blow your nose and have a coffee.  I rode 80 miles, so a reasonable challenge, but not silly.  I felt like I lowered my bodies defences and then the next day I was ill, with chills, nausea and headaches for 4 or 5 days.

Got better then though and a week ago spent a long weekend in Mallorca, cycling 290 miles in 4 days and generally felt pretty good.

Saturday just gone again I woke with a slight nasal congestion, but felt okay and rode a 64 mile ride and once again, I could feel an illness creeping in.  Sure enough, I've got a cold.

As I say, generally I have a strong immune system and don't get ill.  Three times in the last 5 months is the worst build up I could ask for for the biggest physical challenge I've ever taken.

I wanted to test my assumption that I would do better with one of my regular cooking teams cooking the biggest recipes, than if I tried to come up with a specialized team for the event.

No matter what dish is preferred, with a Good Camp Ticket, I will be able to cook the top dish in each category (**Hidden Power Stew** lvl 58, **Defiant Coffee Salad** lvl 55, or **Clodsire Eclairs** lvl 59) 3x a day. It will require 4 ingredient farmers almost all the time (including some swaps) and my E4E - a Gardevoir, likely the only psychic mon I'd be able to have on the team all week. This will put me in the M14+ range on Lapis in week one.

I found three Psychic-heavy team combinations that would put me close to what I could achieve with my best cooking teams - one for each dish type. One caveat is that I don't have a great Espeon, so I've not invested main skill seeds in mine. But if I had the OK Espeon I have maxed, these psychic boosted teams would do just as well, with less ingredient pressure (no swapping required). I have no ingredient farmers at level 60, so these teams assume the first two ingredient slots unlocked.

**Curry Team - Dream Eater Butter Curry** (recipe level 55) - **Espeon** (milk / cacao) and **Mr. Mime** (tomato / potato). I had to supplement this team with a milk / cacao Blastoise and a tomato / potato Victreebel. My mono-apple **Gardevoir** was irrelevant for ingredients. My Blastoise and Vicreebel are decent, so this combo would work with a milk / milk Espeon and a tomato / tomato Mr. Mime.

**Salad Team - Calm Mind Fruit Salad** (recipe level 60) - **Musharna** (milk / honey) and **Gardevoir** (double apple). On this team, **Espeon** would be used for Charge Strength but ingredients would be filler. I filled out the team with a honey / apple Pinsir and double corn Bewear - Musharna can't meat the honey requirements on its own, and even if Gard had corn in the second slot, I'd still need the Bewear.

**Dessert Team - Lovely Kiss Smoothies** (recipe level 56) - **Espeon** (milk / cacao), **Musharna** (milk / honey), and **Gardevoir** (double apple). I also slotted in milk / cacao Blastoise, and my cacao / apple Golduck allowed me to add a lot of charge strength with ingredients that match the recipe. Here, Musharna is the only honey provider, so if you've got double milk, you may have to do some swapping. But there is enough overlap for milk, cacao, and apples that different spreads for Espeon and Gardevoir could work.

With each of these team compositions, you may be able to field a team that leverages the skill and ingredient boosts for Psychic mons to cook mid-tier recipes while still matching the Snorlax gains that a top cooking team could yield. Sadly for me, my Espeon is not seeded. Also, my Musharna is still a Munna - no BFS so I want to have a few more catches before I make an investment decision.",3,1743403246.0,PokemonSleep,0,1.0,False

Yesterday my boyfriend and his father went to play golf and afterwards he quickly came to visit - basically just came in for coffee and left. 

Now yesterday when they were playing golf I stayed home and did a major springclean of the house. I also knew my boyfriends father may stop by afterwards so I made banana bread for them to have with their coffee. 

This brings us to the part which bothers me. When my boyfriends father came into the house and I offered him something to drink and the banana bread he made a comment like ""He can't stand people that do nothing during the day, he is so glad that I kept busy and baked"". He even went as far as to say since my boyfriends mother retired he also got her a new hobby and started talking about that. I just need to mention that I am not a fighter - I just kept quiet and asked more about the mother's hobbies and carried on as usual. 

This statement he made bothers me for a few reasons:
1) As I mentioned before - I work full time - I am under no circumstances a stay at home GF - in fact I earn more money than my BF. I feel like he insinuated that women are not entitled to take a break over a weekend to sit and do nothing. Am I overreacting? Because he can go and relax on the golf course - but if you stay home you should be busy. 

2) He actually chose his wife's hobby for her - I get retiring can be hard for some people - to find your place in the world and to get something to fill your time with - but I feel like it should be her choice - he chose stock trading for her - but she is a arts/crafts person who crocets a lot - and she is really struggling with this new hobby of hers. I just feel sorry for her because he just seems so controlling and like she doesn't have a choice even if she doesn't like it.

By Alessandro Carosi

I noticed that when I’m aligned with higher energies I experience much more synchronicities, higher the inner energies and bigger the synchronicity, this time was a small one but that could lead to a bigger one.

I was working in Camden in a cafe’ inside the market and on Saturday a freelance barista shows up for the day to help, at first I thought was a customer and when I asked if he wanted a coffee he tells me that was there to work, nice guy but the interesting part was that he got a full time job for a coffee company that does events around the world included Asia one of my favourite part of the world, he tells me that with his company he spent a lot of time in different Asian countries and that normally they tell to their baristas few months in advance if they are willing to go for a month or more to work anywhere around this crazy planet, you can imagine the joy to know it because that would be the perfect job for me, working in coffee and being in different place of Asia but with the freedom to move around and don’t have to be stucked in one place, this is something I was thinking about it recently and this is one of the synchronicities, how to be able to work in coffee in Asia but able to stay freelance, this is the answer.

We aren’t done yet because the day after going to the gym in Sheperd Bush that is in west London early in the morning before work who is there working out? The same guy from the day before in Camden that is in North London, quite far from where I was, I see him and he see me and we have a small chit chat, for me this is a strong sign that I’m heading in the right direction, don’t know how it will unfold but no need to push anything because trying to control what is happening is like a sign saying you don’t trust the process, actions are needed obviously but only when it’s done going with the flow.

1jnwwm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1jnwwm2/weird_but_tasty_protein_espresso/,Weird but Tasty: Protein Espresso,"Tried something weird(or not), and it actually worked! Here's what I did: 

- 1 frozen espresso shot (Zenma Coffee, dark roast) > defrosted.

- 20g whey protein from muscleNectar (tried both vanilla and Dutch chocolate with stevia)

- 100-120 ml milk -  mixed really well with whey separately

- A lot of ice

Poured the whey-milk mix over the espresso and ice—no blending, just a smooth, layered drink. 

The vanilla whey gave it a light iced latte feel, while the Dutch chocolate version had a subtle mocha vibe. No added sugar, just straight-up coffee + protein.

Honestly, this might be my new go-to pre-workout or afternoon summer drink. 

I'm gonna try with water next instead of milk, although no complaints whatsoever with added milk. 

Anyone else tried something similar? Would love to further experiment here! ",3,1743402501.0,IndiaCoffee,2,1.0,False

Drumroll, please... signage products!
Signage acts as a silent brand ambassador, creating an immediate, tangible link with consumers.
McDonald's golden arches are visible from far away, instantly making people think of fast, budget - friendly meals. Luxury brands like Louis Vuitton use high - end signage to convey luxury. craftsmanship, and exclusivity.
Consistent signage is crucial for brand success. Coffee shop chains that use the same logo, color scheme, and font across all their signs build a unified brand image. This makes it easier for customers to recognize and remember the brand.
Signage is also adaptable. Brands can update it to match changing trends, seasons, or marketing campaigns. Clothing stores can swap seasonal signs, while digital signage allows for dynamic content like videos and promotions.
Well - designed signage improves the customer experience. Wayfinding signs in malls and airports help customers navigate, making the brand more appealing and encouraging repeat visits.
To make the most of signage for long - term brand success, invest in high - quality products.
Shoddy signage can make a brand seem unprofessional. Work with experienced signage providers who can offer tailored, creative solutions.
In khort, signage products are essential for building long - lasting brands. By creating a strong visual identity, maintaining consistency, adapting to change, and improving the customer experience, signage helps brands stay relevant and thrive.",2,1743402198.0,signagefactory,1,1.0,False
