I had made the executive decision to try more samples than I would normally would think of trying in a month.  I will likely not keep up this trend of trying more and more perfumes each month.  However, I fully intend on trying perfumes each month.

As per usual, I have a star rating system.  If anyone knows of a half star that works in mobile formatting do show me.  Any .5 extra is used as an indicator that it is just a bit more or a bit less of a previous star in terms my experience.  I'll be rating halves in x.5/5 format.

* ☆☆☆☆☆ Disgusting. Never wearing it after that. Will definitely destach later unless the product is genuinely rancid.
* ★☆☆☆☆ Bad but not intolerable. Unfortunately my skin chemistry disagrees with it. Expect a destach of it later.
* ★★☆☆☆ It is not great but not bad. Unlikely to wear it. Expect a destach of it later.
* ★★★☆☆ Average. I might destach it later or I might keep it to further try out.
* ★★★★☆ This is a good perfume! I am likely impressed by what I smell! I'm more than likely keeping this and may even seek it out again later.  Likely will buy a bigger bottle.
* ★★★★★ Amazing! This perfume is perfect for me. I will definitely be wearing it later and will buy a bigger bottle of it.

# DSH

The perfumes coming from this brand came in relatively quickly.  I wasn't expecting to review yet 2 more perfumes but I have 2 free samples in with my full size of mango cocktail essence.  Mango cocktail has grown on me.  I love how sour it is.  The undertones of coconut smooth it out nicely as well.  The packaging was bigger than expected.  It started in an envelope when inside was a box.  In this box were packing peanuts layers of bubble wrap.  By the very least, this is very sturdy packaging.  Though, it makes me wonder if DSH could reduce the package size to better fit the order proportions.  Nonetheless, I am excited to try these 2 free samples.  If I end up not liking them, by the very least I have something for my destach pile.  I obtained these bottles October 18, 2024.

**Mangoes On Ibiza no.525 VdP**: I was surprised to see this perfume.  The name intrigued me.  I like mango perfumes quite a bit and the number made it a bit cryptic.  Even when I end up not enjoying the perfume, surprise samples are very fun for me to try.

>This once “local” secret is now available to all of our clients: a one of a kind perfume creation, made with upcycled bottles, specialty materials from olfactory / visual art projects, and big time creative juice. We will post new arrivals as we make them available every month or two… detailing the scent concept and the note structure.

The liquid in the bottle smells vague.  The hints in the bottle are not important as skin changes the scent.  Nonetheless, I find it fun to do which is why I do this every new review.  The perfumes smells similarly vague on my skin.  I am not surprised given the description of the perfume.  Unlike my other DSH samples, there is a surprisingly generous amount of fluid.  It appears to be almost full.  The color is pink-ish.  While the concept is cool, unfortunately I won't get much milage out of this perfume.  A lucky soul may receive it in the future.  ★★☆☆☆

**Aqua de coco**: This was one of 2 perfume samples given to me for free in my order of mango cocktail.  It sounds nice, though I'll have to judge how much I like it.

>Coconut water is one of the most refreshing and replenishing sensations of summer. Our Aqua de Coco is just as light and cooling… with that subtle hint of salt mixed in with the creamy, watery coconut fragrance. What a perfect accompaniment to summer fun.

I smell fresh coconuts in the bottle.  It isn't that sweet but it has the dimensions of coconut I remember smelling when I processed 2 fresh coconuts.  It smells similar on my skin but less pronounced.  It becomes very light on my skin.  For what it is, it is a refreshing coconut.  However, the lack of fragrance leaves me disappointed.  I'm not entirely surprised given that coconuts already aren't the most aromatic fruits.  ★★☆☆☆

As a side note, I have been experimenting with layering perfumes out of curiosity.  Some perfumes layer well while other ones may fight and the winner mask the other perfume.

# SunSphere Scents

I have been eyeing this brand for a while now.  The entire aesthetics of it reminds me a bit of a dear friend who has since moved away.  I always appreciate when samples allow me to select from a collection of option to try.  The packaging was simple yet very secure.  It came in a box with strips of paper confetti-like dampener.  I appreciate this as it is very to the point, especially when I am only getting a singular sample pack.  Ordering from the site was very standard and smooth.  I look forward to trying these perfumes.  I obtained these bottles October 18, 2024.

**Sunsphere sunset**: Given the name of this brand and the name of this perfume I felt almost obligated to try it.  That is why it is in this review.  I look forward to seeing what I think of it.

>golden amber, ethereal lavender, sandalwood, a hint of coffee

On my skin, I smell something a bit fruity, soft, and a bit sweet.  A strange interaction with my throat happens.  The scent initially dried it out slightly. Could be that I need to hydrate up as it is morning though so I will not fault the perfume.  The smell reminds me a bit of watered down juice.  I unfortunately don't really vibe with this perfume. ★★★☆☆

**1991**:

>saltwater, grapefruit, an old boardwalk

The sunsphere scent perfumes come in a spray so it is a tad more difficult to get a proper whiff of just the liquid.  On my skin I smell a hint of grapefruit that quickly permeates the air.  The salty scent is a nice touch.  The boardwalk isn't particularly noticable.  I'm guessing it is supposed to be a woodsy-note of sorts.  It has a somewhat similar profile to sunohere sunset.  I'm not particularly impressed.  Someone else will get more enjoyment out of it than me.  ★★★☆☆

**Candoro Marble**:

>smooth sandalwood, aged peppermint, rose

When I open the cap, I smell a faintly clean scent.  The peppermint quickly becomes apparent.  However, it has strange dimensions.  The rose does not smell present while the sandalwood is a bit more noticeable.  I smell mint but nothing else.  It reminds me of the native mint I would smell whenever I'd rub leaves.  It isn't a scent I'm feeling very enthusiastic about. ★★☆☆☆

So far, it isn't looking very good for sunsphere scents.  Maybe I chose wrong.  I hope at least one perfume will impress me.

**Lake Days**:

>clear lake water, sunscreen, inner tubes, mimosa tree blossoms, cedarwood

The perfume smells a bit salty in the bottle.  There isn't much scent given off.  I smell some wood.  On my skin, I do not smell very much.  There isn't much to review because it isn't giving me very much to smell, unfortunately.  This is all reviewed with 1 spritz.  I might giving them a second smell over with two spritz later to see if it makes much of a difference.  ★★☆☆☆

**Coconut**:

>creamy coconut, skin musk, a worn leather bracelet, grass

In the bottle I smell something skin to coconuts.  The husks of coconuts seem more apparent.  The grass comes in not long after.  Within seconds it switches from leather to grass again, the coconut having left the room in mere moments.  It is a relatively subdued smell.  It is okay. ★★★☆☆ I probably smelled it a bit more strongly because when opening it to take a whiff of the liquid it started to leak, likely having been topped off before the lid being screwed on and shipped.

So far, I am finding out I prefer the sweet dimensions of coconut.  However, I have yet to sample a savory coconut perfume (perhaps modeled after a savory coconut dish).

**Hodges**:

>forgotten books, vanilla, orris, sheer woods

The perfume smells very try in the bottle.  It is akin to crisp paper.  I can smell the orris, a hint of vanilla, and the paper.  I'm unsure if I really smell the woods.  Overall, this perfume got what it described about right.  However, it isn't really my cup of tea.  ★★★☆☆ This perfume would do well with a book lover.

Unfortunately, none of the perfumes from Sunsphere Scents were hits.  I do appreciate what they were going for, being not very sweet perfumes.  I'm glad other people enjoy this house.

# Wild Veil

This is a perfume house I had only recently heard out.  I was intrigued.  I had never bought a high-end perfume before so I thought to get some samples.  The package came in as expected.  There was no fanfare.  It came in a simple package with a tiny cardboard box inside.  There was a wild veil sticker in the box.  In the box is 3 tiny vials with what appears to be a dried pansy.  I can tell it is real as it smells nice, has an organic feel and is brittle.  Each vial appears to have a bit of brown paper wrapped around it with hand written names of the kind of perfume inside them.  There appears to be no leakage or damage.  I obtained these bottles on October 21, 2024.

**Passion Flower Soliflore**:  This was a perfume I selected because it sounded interesting.  I have been a fan of passionfruit for a while now.  The fruit and flowers of a plant can be wildly different.  I am half hoping I smell something a bit fruity but given that this is a floral perfume, I expect something very nice.

>Earthy, salty, tender, erotic, sweet

It smells like chai tea.  It is akin to hay.  I do not mind it.  It is quite nice.  Though, this was a very expected result.  It smells fresh and earthy with sweetness.  I am unsure what to think of this perfume.  It certain is not a rose.  As it evolves, it becomes sweeter yet this change is subtle.  3.5/5

**Petrichor Soliflore**: When selecting perfumes I was limited by what I could ask for.  The site had given me limits.  I couldn't request any of the solid perfumes as they wouldn't work in the samples.  Wild Veil also has a massive catalogue so it took me a bit but I eventually settled for three perfumes.  This was one of them.  I do not have any rain-themed perfumes yet so I'll see what I think of it.

>The brink of rain hangs fragrant in the air, preceding the electrifying odor of ozone sparked by forks of lightning piercing the atmosphere.

The liquid in the bottle does not have very much scent.  The scent is also very light on my skin.  I can kind of smell something but it isn't very pronounced.  I unfortunately cannot give it a proper review.  ★★☆☆☆

**Salem**: As a third selection, chose this one to try something unlike the other two in some way.  the notes make it sound lovely.  If I were to guess it will smell a bit sweet, spiced, with notes on the green spectrum with fruit in the mix.  The plums and apricots will likely not appear in the scent profile for me.  I have a good feeling about this one.

>Cortland apples, muscat raisins, New England roses, nutmeg, squash blossom, baked pumpkin, colonial rum, black cherries, plums, apricots, Boston tea, honeysuckle, spice

In the bottle I smell something fresh.  It reminds me if medicine but not the unpleasant dimensions of a medicinal smell.  It is a sweet, earthy, green, warm smell.  It reminds me of scented pinecones and cedar wood.  There is something very comforting about this smell.  It is like if I stepped into cedar cabin and smelled a spiced tea brewing.  ★★★★☆ This is by far my favorite of the three.  As it evolves the spices become more prominent.  The roses also come out to play though it is subtle.

I was excited to try this house.  It is very nice and unlike the other houses I have sampled so far.  I might try more of their perfumes in the future.  This is an expensive house which limits how much I can sample at a time each month.  I'll have to admit that the fact this house grows a majority if not all of the ingredients that they use does appeal to me.

# D'Orange

This is the first non-indie I will be reviewing.  I was recommended it by an acquaintance.  The perfumes came in a much larger box.  This box appears to be custom as it as words printed on it and the website.  Inside this box is a much smaller box containing the perfumes and bubblewrap.  I've said this before, but I prefer when my perfume comes in appropriately sized packages that aren't oversized.  The perfumes also come in even smaller boxes.  These boxes each has a part sectioned off that contain the small, glass vials.  There is no damage or leakage I can smell.  I obtained these bottles on October 21, 2024.

On a somewhat unrelated tangent, it appears google tracked this purchase and is giving me annoying ads for this brand in youtube.  This has made me feel discouraged from buying from this brand again.  On the bright side, they are brief and do very minimal to influence my opinion of the products (some perfume commercials go very overboard).  I'll be the judge of if the quality holds up by the very least.

**Dangerous Complicity**: I had chosen to try this perfume because my acquaintances wanted to hear what I thought of it.  I'll see what I think about it.  It sounds fruity and sweet so I might like it.

>Once the aphrodisiac rush of ginger and rum burns through, this perfume unveils this passionate pact between fruit, flower and flesh. 

The scent is light.  One spritz barely feels like enough.  A second spritz does not seem to change much either.  It has barely any more scent than water.  I unfortunately cannot rate this perfume properly. ★★☆☆☆

**Hermann**: Like the one above it, I was recommended to try this one.  I was told it smells light high quality mint.

>A cool, sheer and woody blend that is unlike any other.

It smells akin to green mint with wood.  It is a nice smell.  It reminds me of the plant without the methane notes.  I'll have to sit on this one.  It is so far the better of the two I have tried.  ★★★☆☆

**I am trash**: I have been on a fruit perfume binge for a bit now.  This perfume will be another one in this personal trend.  It does genuinely sound nice.  Hopefully, this perfume will smell better than the other ones.

>Rose petals, already distilled Sandalwood chips, and even leftover Apples from the food industry to create the most beautiful fruity, floral, and woody blend.

One spritz gave me a generous amount of perfume.  It smells like sweet apples.  I do like it, though it does lack sour dimensions.  I like my apples more than just sweet.  It is a lovely perfume nonetheless.  ★★★☆☆

**You or Someone Like You**: I forgot why I chose this one.  The name sounded interesting.  The description doesn't seem to really explain what it smells like, especially as someone who has never been to Los Angeles.

>...Anne is a recent transplant in awe of the possibility that lingers in the crisp blue air of Los Angeles.

...It certainly smells like perfume.  It exists.  Honestly, I have no idea what to say.  It smells about average.  I think I smell aldehydes and a hint of apple.  It is not very interesting to me.  ★★☆☆☆

Trying D'Orange was an experience.  However, I did not come back with any interesting experiences.  This brand isn't my cup of tea.  It was sort of fun.  I know I am being extra harsh in this brand.  Understand that commercials sour my mood.  Here's to hoping I don't get another D'orange commercial.

# Hexennacht

I had tried this house previously.  While not everything was a hit, I really liked their Boo-Berry.  I decided to get a full size as I enjoyed it enough to have long-term.  I did not expect to get a sample.  The package came in an envelope with the bigger bottle wrapped in cardboard to cushion it.  The sample was wrapped in a piece of paper with writing on it and The City printed.  I unfortunately, tore this paper up as I opened it so I was not able to read it.  There was a delay in shipping but overall it came in just fine.  The bottles have a high quality feel to them.  The sample is not the normal want and opens up like any vial would.  I opened it to get a peak and the accidental whiff I got from it was divine. I obtained this bottle on October 23, 2024.

**Pepparkräm**: this was a surprise sample for me.  I bought the boo-berry without any expectations for free samples because some houses don't give out any.  This is a generous amount for a sample.  It looks to be 2 ml or maybe 2.5 ml.  Either way, I am excited to try it.

>Dr. Pepper soda, vanilla bean ice cream.

I had never drank a Dr. Pepper before so I do not have any reference in it.  When I open it up I smell something like vanilla yogurt.  On my skin, this quickly changes.  It goes from a dairy-like sweetness to being an artificial sweetener.  It reminds me of pepto bismol or cotton candy flavored pink suckers.  Unfortunately, this is not a scent I desire to wear.  This is probably the very first time I liked how it smelled in the bottle more than on my skin. ★★★☆☆

# BlackHeart Tart

I had been eyeing this house for a bit now.  White chocolate isn't a very common scent so when I heard of a perfume that was all about that I knew I had to give it a try.  This house is very sweet-gourmand focussed which is in line with my tastes.  The package came in from ajevies as I wanted to reduce my shipping costs. It came like expected: a simple envelope with bubblewrap protecting the bottles.  It also came in with 2 maple candies and 2 random stickers.  I obtained these bottles on October 23, 2024.

**Butter Me Up**: This is a perfume I'm excited for.  It is a white chocolate perfume.  It sounds absolutely decedent.  However, will it be too sweet?  Let's find out.

>Velvety cocoa butter and golden vanilla are mingled with sweet amber musk and a touch of aromatic ylang ylang essential oil. Butter Me Up will melt your heart with its baby soft, comforting aroma.

In the bottle is a very very lightly sweet scent.  On my skin it is also very light.  This is a perfume that permeates the air with a light scent.  However, up close it isn't really detectable.  It seems to build slowly.  Unfortunately, the scent remains quite light.  I'll have to toss it into the destach pile. ★★☆☆☆

**Olive My Love**: I had chosen this one because I haven't tried a perfume with any olive theming.  Upon seeing the description, however, this appears to be a citrus perfume.

>Reminiscent of a Mediterranean orange grove. Aromatic orange flower, citrusy mandarin, and herbaceous green vines.

There is a hint of oranges with a larger dose of leaves when I smell the bottle.  On my skin, the orange blossoms and greens come out.  It almost smells like there are spices in it.  It smells like it would go good in a hight quality soap.  While the perfumw scent isn't particularly strong it smells good.  3.5/5

# Lucky #9

This was a house I had heard about.  Because it was on ajevies I decided to give it a try to go with my order of blackheart tart.  I do not know much on it besides it is cat-themed.  It came in the same package as my blackheart tart order.  I obtained these bottles on October 23, 2024.

**Cabana Cat**: I chose this perfume because I am still in the mood to try coconut perfumes.  This one sounded pretty nice.  It is probably not going to be too sweet.

>Young green coconut cream, tropical orchid, toasted praline.

The coconut and pralines become apparent when taking a whiff of the bottle.  The blend is interesting on my skin.  There is a fruitiness in it, though I cannot quite say what it would be.  The orchid might be there but I'm not sure what to look for for that note.  The pralines add a nice, sweet undertone without being overpowering.  I quite like it! ★★★★☆

**Tomcat**: I wasn't too sure what my second choice would be so I settled in a rather mundane named perfume.  It also sounds like it'll be a nice rounding on my selection.

>Cedar and sandalwoods, a light verdant musk, whispers of ocean and mint.

It smells green in the bottle like ivy leaves.  The green notes strengthen on my skin.  It is a clean smell with some familiarity to the place I currently live.  Unlike werewold or persian tearoom, this is a rather simple green scent without much else to its undertones.  Overall it is very nice.  I'll have to see if I want a full size or not. ★★★★☆

These two samples have convinced me that I should give more samples from Lucky #9 a try.  The fact it is on Ajevies means I can sample it with other samples found in that site as it reduces the overall shipping cost.

# Solstice Scents

This is admittedly one of my favorite houses.  I will usually come back with least 1 perfume sample that I want a full size of.  The package was a back stuffed with black tissue paper.  There was a small mishap on shipping, however I managed to fix the address and receive my package.  The packages tend to come with cards that advertise their other perfumes.  This is probably one of the few ads I actually enjoy because it is easy to store and doesn't take up any screen space (or intrude on the music I listen to). I obtained these bottles on October 28, 2024.

**Victorian Tearoom**: I chose this as the free sample because it sounded interesting.  Though, admittedly, I did not glance at the note profile until now.  It sounds quite fruity.

>Palmarosa, Kumquat-Orange Marmalade, Chamomile, Rose, Lemon, Black Tea, Amber Base

The orange is the first thing I smell in the bottle.  On my skin I smell a mixture of smells from the sour marmalade, lemon, black tea, and chamomile.  The rose is slow to come out but when it does it adds yet another layer of complexity.  This is quite an interesting smell and not comparable to any other perfumes I've tried so far.  ★★★★☆

I expect to try more SS perfumes in the future.  This is definitely a house I will return to time and time again.  The popularity of SS is warranted in my opinion.

# Posie

Posie was one house I had heard about from this sub.  It came in an envelope and inside were my samples packages in decorative tissue paper with a golden sticker sealing it.  I am quite excited to see I think of my samples.  I've heard good things about this house.  I obtained these bottles on October 28, 2024

**Hera**: A free sample was offered with my purchase in which I chose this perfume.  Another strawberry perfume wouldn't hurt.  I'm uncertain how much I'll like it as strawberry could turn into a candy scent rather than a fruity scent full of dimensions.

>slices of yellow cake layered with strawberry jam, fluffy vanilla icing, soft pink lotus blossoms

The vanilla is the first thing I smell when opening the bottle.  It is a subtle scent.  The yellow cake comes out on my skin skin with a whisp of strawberry.  I am not getting any of the delightful sour notes, unfortunately.   On a positive note, this isn't an overly sweet scent.  The perfume itself isn't that strong either as I cannot really pick up on it when I take a testing whiff of my wrists.  Someone else may feel much more joy about it than me when I destach.  ★★★☆☆

**Twice to Tea**: I quite enjoy tea perfumes.  The green notes tend to be nice without being overpowering.  This sounds like a sweet tea perfume which I do not think I've tried this type yet.

>a strongly brewed cup of Earl Grey tea delicately infused with all natural lavender absolute, sweetened with vanilla syrup, and lightened with a splash of milk

The scent in the bottle is like green tea.  The milky notes quickly come out on my skin.  It is slightly sweet.  There is a whisper of lavender as well.  The vanilla is subtle.  This perfume smells like a pleasant drink.  I do wonder if it pairs well with my rose mallow.  3.5/5

**Velvet Moon**: I had stumbled upon this one a few times.  To my memory, the most recent mention I read was in regard to smelling like a gay wizard.  I too would like to smell like a gay wizard so I am definitely giving it a try.

>cardamom, a wood-paneled library filled with old books, black pepper, a velvet dressing gown, paper + ink, flickering beeswax candles

It smells subtly sweet in the bottle.  On my skin I smell sweet paper.  It is a clean scent.  It isn't a particularly strong smell.  It permeates the snell as something spiced and sweet with the bookish paper notes being more noticable up close.  I'll give it another try later for sure.  ★★★☆☆

**Whisper Your Bitter Things**: My last review included at least 1 coffee perfume.  Reviewing them made me realize that I want a bitter coffee scent.  I was excited to learn about this perfume and had to try it.

>pressed coffee beans, dried clove bud + cassia bark, jasmine and neroli blossoms, roasted vanilla pods

I am quite happy about this one.  It smells like a good cup of coffee.  It isn't overly sweet but it does have mellow sweet notes.  However, I do wish it was a stronger scent.  I'm unsure if I can smell the other floral notes.  The vanilla does come through and add some sweetness without being overpowering.  Either way, It is one of the better coffee perfumes I've smelled.  3.5/5

Posie was an interesting try.  For the most part, the perfume descriptions are quite accurate.  All of the ones that I have tried so far seem a bit weak for my tastes.  I will definitely have to give more of the catalogue a try at some point.

# Hoshi Gato

Much like Posie the package had come in a simple envelope except it was lavender purple.  In it was a sweet paper smelling paper.  In cursive writing the sender expressed their excitement to see if I like what has been picked out for me.  There was a cute red stamp of Japanese on it.  It also has a card with contact info.  The perfumes are in a tiny lilac cardboard box with a hot pink sticker with a simplified text logo.  The entirety of this packaging is quite cute.  I look forward to reviewing these.  I obtained these bottles on October 28, 2024.

**Blueberry Skies**: This is yet another blueberry perfume.  I am excited to try as I quite enjoy blueberry as a flavor and smell.  The notes make me believe it'll be a calming blueberry.  Blueberry and lavender sounds lovely

>blueberry, Lavender fleurs, Hyacinth, Orris root, vanilla, cedarwood

because this comes in a spray bottle I'll have a harder time taking a whiff of the bottle.  The lids are on quite tight so I'll judge it from on my skin alone.  The sprayer takes only 2 pumps to work.  In my experience, some sprayers take many more pumps.  The blueberry becomes quickly apparent.  This is akin to a candy blueberry rather than a natural blueberry smell.  It smells quite nice regardless.  The lavender is soft and the cedar works well.  The vanilla note elevates the sweet fruit.  I really like this one, though I'm unsure if I'll go for a full size.  ★★★★☆

**Creep**: This was a perfume included in the sample pack.  It sounds like it'll be on brand with October, the spooky month.  What is a better time than now, the 31st to try it?

>Gravestones, Wet dirt, Moss, Crisp green apple, French lavender, Hyacinth, Orris root, Patchouli, Benzoin, Oud, Oakmoss, Cetalox

The green apple and dirt come out as the very first scents.  The lavendar sweetens it and the cetalox makes it smell cleaner.  The oud is kept very low and seems to be used for another layer on the dirty.  This smells like eating a sweet and sour green apple on a graveyard shift.  It is very nice.  ★★★★☆

**Death of a Strawberry**: This one excites me.  I love strawberry perfumes.  Though, judging by creep and blueberry skies this may very well be a candy strawberry scent rather than anything realistic.  Either way, I'm excited to try this one.

>Dying strawberry, pine needles, Jasmine grandiflorum , sweet damask rose, ylang ylang, Bourbon vetiver, sandalwood, oakmoss, patchouli

My hunch was correct.  This is a candy strawberry scent.  It has some... interesting dimensions to it.  The dying strawberry comes through maybe a bit strong.  It smells a bit like your average strawberry candy.  It's okay.  ★★★☆☆

**Frooty**: This is yet another fruit themed perfume!  This ones sounds like it could be quite lovely.  I do not have a fruit salad style perfume yet so if I happen to like it enough, I could have some extra variety to my collection in the future

>sugared lemon, cherry, classic fruity cereal, Almond milk

The sugared lemons come out as the first note.  The cherry isn't that far behind.  The classic fruity cereal note quickly follows.  It smells exactly as expected.  It is quite a joyful smell. ★★★★☆

**Meloncholy**: I remember hearing about this perfume in an email I had with the creator of Hoshi Gato.  It peaked my interested because as of writing this I have not tried a melon perfume yet.  I'm uncertain how much I'll like it because the smell of cucumbers often makes me gag.  Hopefully, this won't smell like cucumbers.

>green melon, forest greenery, Aquatic musk, tuberose absolute, French lavender, Tobacco absolute, Incense, spiced woods, Veramoss

...I smell cucumbers.  It smells exactly like cucumbers.  I didn't gag but I'm also not really pleased.  This is a me problem.  ★★★☆☆

**Rainbow**: The graphics on these perfumes are pretty and cute.  Rainbow is one great example of this.  The scent list makes it sound fresh and floral.

>ozone, blooming grass, water lily, Wild strawberry, Jasmine, Ylang Ylang, Misty air, Vanilla, Floral musks

The strawberry is subtle yet noticeable.  The grass nite is very quick to come in.  I can smell the ylang-ylang and jasmine as well.  It smells light, fresh, a bit fruity, and floral.  I enjoy the simplicity of this scent.  ★★★☆☆

**Sun Catcher**: This is the one I am probably most excited about.  I like fruity perfume and this one sounds like the definition of it.

>sugared pineapple, cranberry, cherry, Mango, Strawberry, Rose, vanilla, black tea

It smells like fruit snacks.  I like fruit snacks, though I don't think I want to smell like snacks.  Nonetheless, it is a high quality perfume. ★★★★☆

Hoshi Gato has proven to be a nice house.  I'll likely review more perfumes from them in the future.  Though, their selection is small so I may need to wait for when they release more to get a nice number of them (4 - 5 samples) to review at once.

# NAVA

This is a house I am familiar with.  I don't think this house needs an introduction.  I found a decant that offers samples of NAVA perfumes and I am very pleased about it.  I am excited to try these.  I specifically chose a selection of fruit-themed scents.  The strawberry crystalline I have has become a wonderful staple in my selection.  I obtained these bottles on November 1st, 2024.

**Coconut Moonstone**: Ever since I tried rose mallow by Solstice Scents I have been really wanting to find another coconut perfume that smelled pleasing to me.  I have a good feeling about this perfume.

>Egyptian Coconut Husk, Studio Limited Moonstone (The true Husk, black and white Fleck, essence and whole of African White Vanilla with a kiss of Crystalline) and a drop of peach

I smell sweet, fresh coconut in the bottle.  on my skin it is a silkier coocnut smell. It is quite nice with the right amount of sweetness for a fresh coconut perfume. The only down side is how short it lasts on my skin before fading- mere minutes.  It smells good but I wish it lasted longer. ★★☆☆☆

**Desert Fig & Ambre Noir**: I do not have a fig perfume yet which is why I am trying one.  I have memories of being near fig trees and smelling the fragrant bark as I prepared a branch to propagate a new tree.  Fig bark is one of my favorite smells.

>Ripe Desert Fig, Blackened Fig skin, Vietnamese Agarwood, Amber accord, White Patchouli, Red Musk, Desert Myrrh infused Musk, Amber resin accord, Desert Nevada Rock Rose, Frankincense and bruised Violet petal essence

upon opening the bottle I get a whiff of something sweet and soft.  On my skin I get something sweet, somewhat smokey, musky, and woodsy.  It is complex and a bit unfamiliar.  It has undertones of spice kind of like cloves.  There is definitely floral aspects to it.  I like it a lot, though I don't see myself wearing it regularly.  ★★★☆☆

**Eternal Tut Ankh Amun**: For the sake of trying another eternal chose this one.  I have tried eternal ankh before so I'm this one will smell nice as well.

>Bourbon Vanille Absolute, Crystalline Absolute, Tonka Absolute, Bastet's Vanilla Bean Absolute accord, and White Amber

The smell of sweet vanilla is very recognizable in the bottle.  It is relatively light on my skin.  It smells sweet and woody.  It is soft and nice.  It is a good vanilla without being overly sweet.  While it is a good vanilla perfume, I can see other people appreciating it more. ★★★★☆

**Raspberry Cream & Roses**: It is a fact that I love raspberries.  I had chosen this perfume because I do not have a raspberry one yet.  Though, I hope the roses do not overpower the other notes.

>Sweet Raspberry accord, Toasted Coconut, Vanilla Cream accord, Vanilla Fleck, Bulgarian Rose Otto, Red Rose petals

In the bottle, the rose aspect is very strong.  It smells good by the very least.  On my skin it smells like sweet rose cream with some raspberries inside.  The coconut is also there.  I like it, though I feel it is a bit too sweet.  The raspberry note isn't very pronounced, either.  Overall, it smells good but is maybe not raspberry enough.  ★★★☆☆

**Star Fruit Mango & Egyptian Musk**: I have found I like mango perfumes.  I feel like star fruit would add to it.  Both are citrus-y though mango is definitely a heavier scent

>Fresh Star Fruit essence, Egyptian Musk, Hawaiian Mango, Peach essence, crushed Star Fruit seeds.

When I open the bottle I smell something delightfully sour and tropical.  The musk comes through with a clean note.  It quickly permeates as a sweet, tart, juicy smell with a hint of poweryness.  The starfruit and mango work wonderfully together.  I very well might get a full size of this.  4.5/5

While not everything was a hit, it was a very nice experience nonetheless.  I really liked that I could try these out.  Though, I wish I would have liked the raspberry perfume more.  NAVA does their fruit very well.  I'll be trying them out more in the future.

# BPAL

This is a house I hear a lot about but haven't had a chance to try till now.  It looks to be a very popular choice.  The decant that I bought from offered samples of BPAL perfumes that aren't normally available to sample.  I chose a well-rounded sample set this time around.  I obtained these bottles on November 1st, 2024.

**Arachne of Lydia**: I have admittedly never read the last unicorn.  However, I want to.  If I like these perfumes enough I might look for an audiobook to read along to.  This would be one of the fruity perfumes in the collection that I decided to try.

>dusty clove and blackcurrant

The currant and cloves smell relatively mellow in the bottle.  The clove scent gets much stronger when on my wrist.  Despite that, the currant is still in the background, though faintly.  It is a simple scent.  I am a simple man, I quite like the scent of cloves.  ★★★★☆

**Lady Amathea**: This perfume sounded quite nice when I picked it out,  It sounds like a floral perfume with a sweet gourmand leaning.

>A luminous white winter musk with lilac, wisteria, white chocolate, white mint, and tuberose

the mint mixes with something that hints at floral in the bottle.  It passively gives out white chocolate when opened which is an interesting behavior.  On my skin I get a mix of mint, wisteria, and tuberose.  The white appears to prefer to permeate rather than be sniffed up close.  It is soft and nice.  ★★★★☆

**Magic, Do As You Will**: apparently my written review of this perfume was not saved.  I write this review in phases as a draft, revise it, then post the final result.  I chose this perfume because I thought it would smell nice.

>frankincense, guggul gum, mastic, onycha accord, styrax, and deep purple fruits.

Unfortunately, despite the scent list, all I really smelled some a light berry scent and some sweetness.  It was a bit disappointing because I was expecting more nuance to it. ★★★☆☆

**The King's Daughter**: This was yet another perfume I had selected because it sounded quite nice.  I like the scent of lilacs so this one may end up smelling very nice to me.

>lilac musk, sandalwood, sweet pea, watermelon accord, pale woods, elemi, and oakmos

upon opening the bottle I get a light scent of cinnamon.  My guess is that the sweet pea, lilac, oakmoss, and elemi (had to look it up) combined to make a scent in the spice family.  On my skin, however, this quickly changed.  It smells like sweet, floral licorice.  Despite what many may think of licorice, I enjoy the taste of it.  It is pretty nice.  I'll have to compare it with Lady Amathea as they have some similarities. ★★★★☆

**Witch-Cursed Castle**: This is a more earthy perfume I have selected.  While I am finding earthy perfumes are not necessarily my favorite, I still enjoy the experience.

>Weed-strewn oak, opoponax, wet stone, creaking redwood, and desolate olibanum.

It smells a bit sweet and slightly spiced in the bottle.  This changes on my skin.  Its sweetness changes to more of a hay-like sweetness with hints of wood and brightness. It smells nice.  The notes work in harmony to create a nice experience.  I'm not entirely sure if it smells like anything familiar to me.  Maybe like the natural, sweet scent of clean skin without any of the animalistic notes? ★★★★☆

BPAL is a house I have been excited to try.  I'm glad to have been given this opportunity.  Overall, these perfumes smell very high quality and for the most part hit the mark on what they are trying to achieve.  I look forward to try more of their perfumes in the future.  I'll likely get a few full sizes later on.  For now, I'll be further testing and getting comfortable with what samples I have.

# Closing Thoughts

This is by far the most perfumes I've sampled at once.  It will likely be the most perfumes I sample at once for a long time.  I do not intend on doing massive samples like this every time.   I've finally gotten into sampling floral perfumes which I'm quite happy about and tried a non-indie brand.  I've even gotten around to sampling a few white chocolate perfumes.  Though, I feel my selection is beginning to round out quite nicely.  I do not know if I'll get to sampling more this month or perhaps waiting until later.  I will close with a few questions:

* Are there any deep, dark chocolate perfumes?
* What is the most fragrant white chocolate perfume you know of?
* Do you know of any very new indie houses I should try?",1,1730860756.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

Once I finally got moving, I headed out and reached Philly. The city was wrapped in a morning fog, almost as if nature itself was **preparing for Election Day**, offering a calm and pleasant atmosphere for voters. ☁️

With my regular Starbucks coffee in hand, I walked toward the office, passing early voters already lined up. Seeing them reminded me of the power of each individual’s vote and how it shapes the future of America. **Long live America! 🇺🇸**

Work today was intense—we were close to launching a new use case but hit a frustrating roadblock. 😞 Still, I’m hopeful; we’re just a step away from a solution. The office was nearly empty, with most people avoiding the city center due to anticipated election traffic.

After work, I noticed even more voters, dedicatedly casting their ballots, while news channels buzzed with updates. The whole world is watching, waiting to see who will take the reins as America’s next president, shaping the journey ahead for the nation and beyond. 🌎

At home, I picked up my decluttering mission again—this time tackling the kitchen. I’m realizing just how much we accumulate without using, and I’m feeling more drawn to the idea of *minimalist living*. The decluttering journey is teaching me as much as it’s tidying my space, though it’s clear this will be a long process. 😅

For dinner, I kept it simple yet satisfying: steamed veggies with toasted bread. 🥦🍞 After a day like today, with the weight of the election and a busy workday, I’m feeling unusually drained, but I know I’ll bounce back.

And oh, the racing thoughts tonight… maybe that’s a topic for another post. 😊 Until then, signing off and hoping for a brighter tomorrow!

1gknwqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1gknwqv/for_my_12th_birthday_my_dad_surprised_me_with_two/,"For my 12th birthday, my dad surprised me with two real life mermaids.","I'm currently completely at a loss what to do. 

I (21f) have just escaped my parents, after finding something horrifying in my dad’s beach house. 

I've always loved mermaids.

Yes, I was one of those kids obsessed with everything mermaid—whether that was TV shows, movies, books—any marine-related media, really, but mermaids especially.

I loved everything about the sea, about water, until I almost drowned on my fifth birthday. So, with a newfound fear of even dipping my toes in the shallows, I became fascinated with fake water instead. 

Mom called it a mental illness. (I can see where she was coming from, considering I asked for every pool or water-related game ever made.) But I was just a kid.

I preferred water to land, and even terrified of it, I still wanted to submerge myself in it, imagining a whole other world. 

I barely remember almost drowning, only the contorting fear twisting inside me and swallowing me up, the inability to speak, my voice cruelly torn away, my breath stolen as I sank further into the abyss—also known as the deep end of our neighbor’s pool. 

Mom said I didn’t realize it was that deep since I was used to our own pool. 

So there I was, sitting on the edge with my legs swinging and a plate of birthday cake in my hands, when I had the bright idea to show the adults how cute I was. 

This is my mom’s retelling, so it's probably exaggerated, but apparently, I dropped headfirst into the pool, cake and all, and sank straight to the bottom. 

Dad dove in after me, pulling me back to the surface, dragging me from the shallows. 

But it was too late.

I was screaming, hysterical, backing away from the pool like it was filled with lava. The crazy thing is, I remember this exact feeling. I remember staggering back, the ice-cold breeze tickling my cheeks feeling wrong compared to the warmth of the water that was supposed to protect me. 

The ice cold concrete of my neighbor’s patio felt *wrong*. 

Land felt wrong. 

The water, that had almost killed me, felt *right*, and I could never understand why. 

Instead of caressing me, this cruel underwater world had dragged me down, down, down, squeezing my lungs and stealing my air, crushing instead of cradling me. I avoided water and didn’t go near any pool after that, even ours; the very one I used to spend every spare hour splashing around in. 

When Mom tried to bathe me, I insisted on the water being ankle-deep, with her using a cup to rinse my hair as I tilted my head back, squeezing my eyes shut... 

According to Mom, I would scream until my throat was raw if there was too much water. 

Even washing my hands and brushing my teeth, I remember timing the flow just right, so I could stick my toothbrush or soapy hands under, count three elephants, and then dive out of the bathroom. 

I flooded the floors on multiple occasions when I forgot to turn off the faucet. 

But still, somehow, I was fascinated with water itself. I loved how it was still, how it ran and trickled and filled my cupped hands…. 

According to Mom, I told my therapist I wanted to be a fish.

However, my therapist had a sort of resolution. She leaned forward and grabbed my hands, squeezing them tight. 

*“Okay, Sadie, well, if you're scared of real water, why don’t you try fake water?”*

Which, I guess, is how my mermaid obsession started.

My therapist started me with little kids’ games about solving puzzles underwater—and immediately, I was hooked. 

Through my fascination with digital water, I found mermaids—beautiful, human-like fish people who could breathe underwater, living in vast, towering cities deep, deep under the sea. 

I watched every Little Mermaid, bingeing mermaid-themed movies and TV shows. 

By the age of nine, I was fully convinced I was actually a mermaid, and touching water would magically transform my legs into a tail.

It didn’t, obviously, so I did what any supposedly mentally ill nine-year-old would do. I swallowed two teaspoons of salt mixed with tears of terror before sticking my head underwater for ten seconds.

Again, nothing happened.

But I was starting to slowly overcome my fear of being submerged in water, so I lowered myself onto the stairs in the shallow end of our pool and forced myself to get used to it.

I was still acclimating when my brother shoved my head under, quickly reminding me of that sensation—the squeezing of my chest, the inability to breathe, choking on bubbles exploding around me. After that, Dad insisted on teaching me how to swim. 

Like me, he’d always been fascinated with water, so he refused to have a child who couldn’t swim. Before my older brother and I were even born, he enrolled us in lessons. Harvey was five years older than me, so he could already swim. 

Dad wanted to take me to the sea, though I was more comfortable in the pool.

However, my swimming classes were short-lived (I barely learned how to keep my head afloat) when Dad left in the middle of the night and never came back. But… neither did my brother.

I woke up around midnight to Mom hysterically crying. I discovered the next morning that Dad had taken my brother hookah diving without proper equipment, and Harvey was in the emergency room. 

Initially, I was told my brother was very sick, which, obviously, I believed. 

I was playing Sonic with my brother only yesterday! In my head, he was just sick in the hospital.

I spent the day expecting him to drag himself into my bedroom at any time, knock something over, call me a name, and run away. But the house was empty. 

Mom didn't come out of her room. 

Not even to take me to school. Instead, I watched Cartoon Network all day. I poked my head in my brother’s room, and it was a noticeable mess, clothes strewn everywhere and a half-packed suitcase.

When I asked to see Harvey a few days later, Mom told me he was dead.

Brain-dead, at least.

She explained it the best she could, choking on her own words.

Harvey had gone too deep, and when trying to resurface, his blood had bubbles and his brain had popped.

I don’t think she was mentally okay enough to explain to her nine-year-old daughter that her brother was dead... 

Yeah, no, considering she used our soda stream and a grape to demonstrate the accident with a hysterical smile on her mouth, almost like she thought it was funny. I didn't find it funny. 

Watching the bubbles in the water and my mother pop a grape between her index and thumb with a huge grin on her face was actually fucking traumatising. 

I know people grieve in their own way. Even as a kid though, I was confused when my brother didn’t get a funeral. 

Dad did come back, but only to try and justify his trip with Harvey. He said it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that he was just doing what was best for his kids.

I already despised him for taking my brother away, but the way he talked about him, insisting that “Harvey loves the water!” made me want to scream. 

He was *wrong.* While I was obsessed with water, my brother had steered away from it, especially the sea. Mom called him a psycho and threw him out. Dad moved to the other side of town, and it was just Mom and me once again.

For a long time, I hated my father. I ignored his letters, calls, texts, and the mermaid figurines he sent me for my birthday. I didn’t understand grieving, and worse, post-grieving. Did such a thing exist? I understood that I was sad, and sometimes I was happy—before feeling guilty for catching myself smiling. 

I missed him, so I got a diary. I wrote to my brother, telling him everything and nothing, sometimes just what I did that day, or telling him how mom was.

I started attending group therapy. One girl said she forgave her father for killing her mother in a car crash but her words became entangled in my mind, frustrating me, bleeding into confusion and anger I couldn't control.

How could she forgive something like that? I asked her after, and she shrugged and said, “It wasn't his fault.” 

“But it *was* my dad’s fault,” I told her, leaning forward in my chair. “He killed my brother.”

The girl, Mia, I think her name was (I could never read her name-tag– it was either Mia, or Mira) folded her arms, shooting me a glare. “Well, maybe you should forgive him.”

When I asked Mom in the car on the way home, she said the exact same thing. 

“It was an accident, Sadie,” Mom said. “Your father took your brother diving, and he wasn't ready.” She averted her gaze, her hands tightening around the wheel. “Harvey asked him to take him out during a storm.”

Something ice cold trickled down my spine. “But you said—”

She said Harvey didn't want to go diving.

There wasn't a storm that night. I would have heard it.

She said my brother hated the ocean, and he wanted no part of it.

Mom’s eyes darkened, and she opened her mouth like she was going to speak, before changing the subject, flicking on the radio. “Do you want to get takeout tonight?”

I wanted to question her, but I didn't even know what to ask.

But then I was questioning my own memories.

Did Mom say what I remembered, or did I mishear her?

It took me a long time to realize maybe Harvey's death wasn't Dad’s fault after all.

After a while of therapy, and listening to other kids’ stories, I started to wonder if hating him was the right thing to do. 

Mom was talking to him civilly, at least. The two of them met for coffee every Saturday, and Mom seemed like she had genuinely forgiven him. 

The other kids asked me if my Mom was *over* Harvey’s death. But I guess laughing was inappropriate. “Grieving is an individual emotion!” Mr. Prescott, our therapist, kept saying, when I was on my knees giggling into the prickly carpet. 

Was my mother over my brother’s death? *Yes, of course she was!* 

That's what I told my friends, who I made sure stayed far away from our house. 

Mom was *fine*, I told everyone. 

She was completely fine, and definitely *not* slowly losing her mind, insisting on buying a giant aquarium for her room and named her new pet flounder fish Harvey. 

*Mom isn't crazy*, I told myself, which became my mantra. 

She just had her own way of grieving. 

Besides, I did like Harvey. 

He was pretty cool for a fish, always waiting for me behind the glass when I got home from school. 

*Mom isn't crazy.*

That's what I told myself (again) when I caught her opening the tank and trying to fish Harvey out of the water to hold him. Unlike other fish though, he didn't freak out or squirm, instead staying cupped in her hands. 

So, no, I finally admitted to my therapy class, bursting into tears..

Mom definitely wasn't over my brother. I was eleven years old, and my mother was on the brink of a breakdown. 

She worked all day every day, and on weekends all she talked about was either work, or Harvey the fish, often pausing so *he* could join in conversations.

Sometimes, she asked him, “How's school?” 

I had to quietly remind her that the fish wasn't actually my brother. 

I needed something– someone– normal. 

I found ‘normal’ in the family pool, enveloping myself in my comfort zone. 

Over the years, I taught myself how to swim, envisioning my tail again. 

In my mind, I could swim away from my family, and never go back. 

Unfortunately, I was old enough to know mermaids weren't real.

The only connection I *did* have with the ocean was with Harvey.

Dad called every day inviting me to visit. 

I always declined. I wasn't interested in his shiny new life. Dad was an architect, and had designed his own house by the sea. 

I ignored him until my twelfth birthday, when he sent a text which just said, “Happy Birthday, pumpkin! I have a surprise for you, but you're going to have to come see it yourself. Our door is always open, Sadie. You're going to love them!”

I wasn't exactly ecstatic. Dad’s new girlfriend, who was half his age, smelled like red tide when she came to visit, and I wasn't looking forward to the awkward conversation I would be having with my father. If I'm honest, though, part of me was intrigued by the photos Mom showed me. 

So, ignoring my therapist, who said, “Just give it a little more time,” I rode my bike to his beach house after school.

Dad’s place teetered on the sea, designed to blend with the ocean itself. 

On the edge of a cliff, with grandiose pillars (which were way too much), lay my father’s house, cut off from the rest of the town, and definitely showing off his wealth. I wasn't expecting it to be so modern. French doors leading me inside sported beta fish carvings, an axolotl in a fifty gallon tank greeting me with its trademark smile. I was hesitant at first. 

If I fully walked inside, I wouldn't be able to leave without having a painful conversation with my father.  But running away seemed childish—even for a soon to be twelve year old. I admit, I was impressed. 

If *these* were the lengths he'd gone to get my attention, well, he had me hook, line, and sinker. Dad had designed his house to resemble an aquarium. 

The hallway was illuminated with a soft blue light, every wall a different tank filled with a variety of fish. It was almost like being in real-life Animal Crossing. 

Farther down, glass floors mimicked the deep ocean, filled with tiny flounder swimming below.

I've always been afraid of heights, so stepping on flooring resembling the deep ocean, twisted my gut, and yet filled me with exhilaration. Like stepping across an underwater world. It was both beautiful, and *way* over the top. But that was Dad’s mo. 

We always had to have the *best* pool when I was a kid. 

“Sadie?” Dad’s voice startled me when I was staring, transfixed by everything around me. I didn't know what to look at first. Everything was *water* themed. 

Even the stairs. It was pretty, sure, but it didn't look *lived* in. The walls were filled with fish, a beautiful display of marine life showcased on every corner. I found myself pressed up against schools of nemo fish spiralling in scarlet streams, stealing away my breath. Beautiful. 

But there was nothing that made this house a home– stained coffee cups and magazines strewn all over the floor. 

That was Mom’s house. 

Dad’s was more like a museum. 

I was intrigued by the kitchen lit up in a bioluminescent glow, slowly inching towards it, when Dad’s voice came again.

This time, from underneath me. “I'm in the basement, sweetie!”

I had half a mind to run. It hit me that I didn't want to see my father, I just wanted to see my surprise. The teenage brain is selfish, but I had my reasons. 

Still, though, I found myself attracted to the basement, my sneakers making smacking noises on the steps. 

Unlike upstairs, the lower levels of Dad’s house were yet to be renovated. Thinking of the death star, there was no stair rail. 

My hands grazed cold brick walls, before darkness became ocean blue, like walking on the seafloor. 

The low hum of a filtration system cut through the silence, my steps quickening. 

The basement was not what I was expecting; a simple room with one singular tank. The stink of seawater and bleach drowned my nose and throat, both clinical and otherworldly, forcing my legs further. 

Dad stood in front, grinning beneath a banner saying, “Happy 12th birthday!”

I was already taking steps forward, my body in control of my mind. 

The tank was darker than the others, tiny green lights at the bottom illuminating clear water. 

I could barely register Dad’s words, my gaze glued to the glass..

His voice sounded like ocean waves crashing against the shore, wading in and out of my ears. “I asked my friends for a favour,” he said. “They specialise in marine research, and…well, during their last expedition, they found something incredible, Sadie.” Dad’s grin was contagious, and in three strides, I was pressing my face against the glass. 

I don't know what I was expecting. 

Was it a new species of fish? 

“They're shy.” Dad hummed. “Just stay there, and they'll come over to you.”

I found my voice strangled in my throat, my skin prickling with goosebumps. *“They?”*

Something warm expanded in my chest when a face appeared behind the glass—a beautiful girl with long dark hair haloing around her, tiny points on her ears and strange rugged skin. But it wasn't her face I was mesmerised by. 

Yes, she was hypnotising, every part of her seemed to glow, wide green eyes and a glittering smile. I staggered back, a cry clawing at my throat, when I realized she didn't have legs. Instead, a long blue tail was moulded to her torso, each scale intricate and sparkling. 

The skin below her waist was rugged, carved into her flesh.

Gills. This couldn't be happening, I thought, dizzily. 

I was staring at a real life mermaid. 

She was so pretty, graceful, gently tapping on the glass, playing an invisible piano with her fingers. I was joining in, laughing when the mermaid pressed her fingertips against mine, when movement came behind her, a shadow looming into view. 

It was a boy this time, dark brown hair billowing around him adorned with seaweed, a green tail in place of legs. There was a noticeable scar on his throat. 

It made me wonder if a fish had attacked him. The merman was different. Unlike his female companion, he *wasn’t* smiling, instead folding his arms and refusing to meet my gaze. When he accidentally made eye contact, he turned and flicked his tail in my face, hiding behind the girl. 

Dad laughed. “The male is quite standoffish. Don't worry, he's like that with everybody. He wasn't easy to catch.”

I could barely speak, staring at the girl, who waved, her smile broadening. 

“Uh-huh.” I managed to choke out. 

I didn't notice my father wrapping his arms around me. His touch felt foreign and wrong, but also comforting. 

I hadn't hugged him in so long. I found myself missing him, and the conversation I wanted to have, all of those poisonous words in my throat, contorted into childish squeals of joy. “They're yours, Sadie,” Dad murmured into my hair. “I have a deal where I can keep them here for observation, but they're officially *yours*.”

“Mermaids.” I said. 

Dad nodded. “Well, the scientific name for them is HAB, or human-like aquatic beings, but yes,” he chuckled, “They are mermaids.”

Dad paused, striding over to the tank. I noticed the male mermaid flinch, almost immediately swimming over to the glass, tapping his fingers against the pane. 

I joined him, raising my fingers while watching his dark brown curls fly around him, bubbles escaping his mouth when he parted his lips in what I *think* was a greeting. The points in his ears reminded me of fae, and I couldn't stop smiling. 

He looked so human, and yet these tiny details, like his ears, and  narrow features, told me he belonged in the ocean. 

I had dreamed of being able to breathe underwater, and this boy didn't need air to breathe, staring at me with coffee brown eyes. When his head inclined slowly, I couldn't resist a giggle. 

I figured I looked pretty alien to him. 

Dad nudged me playfully. “We haven't figured out their language yet. We know it's quite similar to whales, or even dolphins. It's rare when they do speak, but it's beautiful, Sadie.” Dad’s eyes were wide. “It's almost like they're singing the melody of their world: the songs of their people.”

I prodded the glass, and the merman copied, his lips curling into a scowl. 

The female mermaid swam over, shoving him out of the way. 

She seemed more excited, following my fingers excitedly. 

“What do you think you're going to call them?” Dad hummed. 

I turned to him. “They don't have names?”

He shrugged, and then Dad’s expression was my father again, his eyes growing sad, like he remembered why I was here– and just like me, Dad didn't want to talk about my brother. Turning to face the mermaids, his smile faded. “They were originally named specimen one and two, but I don't think those names suit them.”

I met the girl’s eyes, and like a child, her smile broke out into a grin. 

While she was wide eyed and smiley, the male mermaid folded his arms, carefully tracking me with his gaze, lip curled, like he could sense me thinking up names. 

I traced the glass, the seaweed entangled in the boy’s hair almost resembling a crown. I half wondered, giddily, if the male was a Prince. 

“Falan.” I said, without thinking, and to my shock, he rolled his eyes. 

Dad cleared his throat. “The male seems to have remarkably similar characteristics to a human male,” he said, “His paperwork suggests he copies human expressions.”

I moved onto the girl, who was playful, tapping her fingers against the glass. 

“Aira.”

The girl nodded excitedly, copying my smile. 

Dad was hesitant this time to touch me, instead clapping me on the shoulder. “I think she likes her name,” he said, heading to the door. “Elle is making pasta, if you want to join us? No pressure, sweetie.”

Dad left me with the mermaids, and admittedly, the first thing I did was jump up and down like a, well, a twelve year old. 

I ate dinner with Dad and his girlfriend that  night, and I waited to have “the talk” but it never came. In fact, when I visited the following weekend, everything I wanted to tell him was suffocated by the beings in his basement. 

I spent hours with the two of them, talking to Aira about everything from school to my worries about my mother
She would nod and try to listen, her eyes wide, like she could understand me.

I figured that wasn't the case when I lied and told her an asteroid was going to destroy the planet, and she nodded excitedly, lips spreading into a grin. 

Sometimes, she copied me. When I laughed, she did too– or she tried to. 

I don't think it was easy for her under the water. I started missing therapy sessions to spend time with the mermaids, but it was only Aira who engaged with me, always waiting for me when I arrived, sometimes asleep, curled up at the bottom of the tank. 

Falan, meanwhile, completely ignored me, instead spending all of his time either scowling at me, or closer to the surface. I caught him trying to swim up several times, only to dive back down, returning to his little spot to continue brooding. 

As I got older, I expected the mermaids to age, too. 

But instead, they seemed to be physically frozen around what looked like the ages of early twenties, judging from their looks. I turned thirteen, and I spent every summer and weekend with them. 

Dad told me to entertain them, try and get them used to human activities, so I introduced them to my phone, pressing it to the glass. While Aira seemed impressed (by literally everything), Falan did his signature eye roll, as if saying, “Oh, wow, it's a weird device with a light. I've already seen one.”

Dad did say the male mermaid was talented at mimicking human expression, so I figured Falan *had* seen a phone. 

So, in my quest to impress this stubborn merboy, I showed him a TV, and then my Nintendo 3DS. He didn't seem interested in the TV, but his eyes lit up when I showed him Pokémon. I think it was the bright colours, but his eyes seemed glued to the screen, following my little character. 

I made an unspoken pact with him. 

I showed him Pokémon, playing it with him every time I visited, and he stopped with the scowling and the rolling of the eyes. Falan didn't stop being an asshole, but every time I stepped into the basement, it was him who was waiting, eagerly, his face pressed against the glass. 

When he saw me, the merman leaned back, pretending he wasn't waiting for me. I showed him a new game, Zelda, and he surprised me with the smallest of smiles, his eyes glued to my screen. 

Aira sometimes joined us, but she grew bored easily, either falling asleep, or swimming up to the surface. 

After introducing him to video games, Falan was a lot more animated. 

I was fourteen when I dragged myself, once again, to Dad’s beach house. It was my first year of junior high, and I had nobody to talk to about the mermaids. 

When I came to them, Falan was on the surface, leaning against the side, his head comfortably nestled in his arms. I noticed the tank was open, so it must have been feeding time. 

Every day around 5pm, Dad opened up the tank, dropping in what looked like mutilated fish guts, and little flakes. Falan always ignored the food, while Aira immediately dove for fleshy entrails, stuffing them into her mouth. 

Falan needed a little coaxing, so Dad thrust a long metal pole into the water, gently nudging the merman towards the food. That day, there was no sign of my father, and both mermaids were on the surface. Falan, with his head in his arms, and Aira, looking lost, her eyes wide.

It was the first time I had seen her without her excited little grin.

Falan must have sensed me, since his head jerked up when I dropped my backpack on the floor. 

This was the first time I'd seen him fully on the surface, but when he locked eyes with me, I realized he was panting, struggling to breathe, his fingers gingerly prodding at his throat. The air must have been hurting him, I thought.

He wasn't used to our air, so why was he so insistent on staying on the surface? 

I made my way over to the tank, and to my surprise, he swam over, sticking his head over the side. Falan made a choking sound and I understood he was trying (and failing) to mimic our language. 

He tried again, his eyes strained, lips parting, but no words came out, only strange guttural noises I could almost mistake for words. 

This happened twice. 

The second time, the tank was half shut, but Falan broke the surface when he saw me come in, parted his lips, and tried to speak, seemingly frustrated with his inability to mimic human speech. He tried again, and this time l could see he was visibly struggling to stay on the surface. 

Aira, to my confusion, pulled him back under the water, and to me, pointed upwards. I did my best to communicate with her, just like dad told me. I had to speak with my hands instead of my mouth. 

“You want me to open the tank?” I said, motioning upwards. 

“Sadie.” 

Dad joined me, carrying a bucket full of entrails. He dumped the food in the tank and shut the lid all the way, flashing me a smile. “I know they're pretty to look at, Sadie, but they're also dangerous.” 

He nodded to Falan, who ignored the food, instead pressed against the glass, glaring at my father. “These beings are carnivores, sweetie. I don't mean to scare you, but I don't think swimming with them would be a whole lot of fun.” 

I found myself nodding, watching sharp red dilute the depths, Aira snatching up tangled fish intestine. 

I watched her eat it, sharp incisors biting through a cloud of red obscuring my vision and spreading around her. 

The smile on her face no longer looked playful. She looked happy to be eating, and something ice cold trickled down my spine when her eyes met mine, this time not with curiosity, but something else entirely, something I was in denial of. 

After that day, I guess I started to grow up. The mermaids in my Dad’s basement were beautiful, yes, but all signs pointed to them also trying to lure me into their tank. Dad didn't say *they will eat you*, but he did supervise my visits from then on, making sure I kept my distance. 

The two of them didn't change, but my childhood fantasy of friendly fish people darkened to a more plausible reality. Falan and Aira were not my friends, nor were they my presents. 

I was the naive prey who was almost fish food. 

I stopped visiting after Falan started gesturing me inside their tank. 

I wanted nothing to do with them. 

Growing up, I still saw them during holidays. 

But the basement was filling up with other things, my dad's belongings and my toys from childhood. I saw them once before college, the two of them slamming themselves against the tank when I walked in. I couldn't tell if they were excited or hungry. Aira’s eyes were almost sad, her lips parting as if to say, *You left us*.

Falan tapped the glass, cocking his head. I noticed his scar was bigger. 

Maybe Dad accidentally caught it when he was coaxing the merman to his food. 

I think Falan knew it was a goodbye. He didn't understand the concept of college, and I wasn't going to try to explain it to him. 

I left them like that, and never went back. 

Over these years, I wondered if Dad had released them back into the sea. 

Ever since I left home at eighteen, I've been flying to and from my new college campus every couple of months, due to a respiratory condition that came out of nowhere. 

I thought it was the mold in my college dorms, but when I moved to another room, I still found myself waking up, choking on air, like my lungs refuse to work. Numerous scans informed me I'm completely healthy, and all the doctor can give me is an inhaler. I was supposed to meet with a specialist in town anyway, so I figured I would pay dad a visit. 

I headed back to Dad’s beach house with the excuse to pick up some old  trinkets I left behind. There was no sign of him, so I let myself in, making my way down to the basement. Dad had changed the lighting to a duller blue, and immediately, I was comforted with the familiar stink of saltwater and strong bleach that smelled right. 

The stairs were *wet*, I noticed, slowly making my way down to the basement.

The tank was still there, illuminated in dazzling blue. 

But it was bigger. 

I saw Aira before she saw me, and I noticed a change in her. 

She wasn't smiling. 

Instead, the mermaid’s eyes were alert, her fingers tapping against the glass. 

“Hey.” I greeted her, a cough I couldn't control taking over. 

Aira jumped, startled, when I knocked on the glass. Her gaze found mine, and something twisted in my gut. Her expression was wild, contorted, and not what I remembered. When she pointed upwards for me to open the tank, I shook my head, biting back the urge to say, “Nice try.”

I could tell she hadn't eaten yet. The tank was fresh, so my dad was yet to feed them. 

“Where's Falan?” I asked, remembering how to talk with my expression. 

Aira didn't respond. With a stoic face, she pointed upwards again. 

The absurdity of me talking to my childhood mermaid friend sent me into fits of laughter– which became a coughing fit. 

When I spluttered out a cough, her eyes widened, and I swore her gaze flicked to my torso. With the mermaid mostly ignoring me, I went in search of my trinkets I left behind in one of the towering boxes filling the basement. 

I was looking for my music box, and an old mermaid figurine Harvey had given me for my fifth birthday. 

I found myself going through memory lane diving into boxes of old toys, and my endless collection of mermaid memorabilia. Shoving aside holiday decorations, I stuck my hands in another box, pulling out a folded yellow dress. 

The dress was cute, but I didn't remember wearing it. 

I thought maybe it was Elle’s, but it was way too small. Elle was a curvy woman. 

Throwing the dress aside, I pulled out cargo shorts this time. Followed by a short sleeved band shirt, and a lakers cap covered in dust. With the clothes in my hands, I had a sudden hysterical thought that these were my brother’s clothes. 

But he was dead. He died when I was nine years old. I could feel my hands starting to tremble, digging deeper into the box. This time, a backpack with a tiny Pikachu attached to the zipper. 

I went through it, pulling out workbooks and crumbled schedules, a bottle of water and a crumbling sandwich covered in mold.

Opening the workbooks, I flicked through pages and pages of intricate handwriting. 

A stress toy was at the very bottom of the pack, collecting dust. 

I could sense my breathing starting to accelerate when my hands grasped a bright green handbag filled with make-up, a dead phone, and a laptop. 

But it was right at the bottom of the box, where I found the nail in the coffin that sent bile shooting up my throat. Two college ID’s. The first, neat and looked after, on a red string, belonged to a scowling twenty two year old English major, Matthew Whittam. 

The second ID tag, covered in scribbles and doodles, was twenty three year old Quinn Cartwright, a smiling brunette, who, according to her tag, was a film student. 

The tag slipped out of my hands, and I puked, heaving up my mediocre dinner.

Aira and Falan. 

The beings in the tank were not mermaids. They were fucking HUMAN. 

Before I could stop myself, I grabbed the clothes again, the yellow dead with noticeable smears of red on the collar, and the cargo shorts torn and bloodied when I turned them inside out. I don't even remember standing up. With the ID tag in my hands, I strode over to the tank, pressing Aira’s identity against the glass. 

But she didn't even recognize herself, slowly cocking her head to the side. 

This hurt, a pang in my chest physically squeezing my lungs. 

This time, I opened the tank, and the girl broke the surface. 

She didn't speak, because she *couldn't*, instead flailing her arms. 

I thought back to the scar on Falan's throat, and I felt sick to my stomach. 

Instead of speaking, Aira pointed to the door, her eyes wide and desperate. 

“It's okay,” I told her calmly. “Where's Falan?”

When her eyes narrowed to slits, I caught myself. 

“Matthew.” I corrected, quickly. “Where is Matthew?”

Before she could respond, my father’s voice sounded from upstairs. 

Followed by what sounded like muffled screaming. 

Aira’s head snapped to me when the muffled screaming grew closer, my father’s footsteps following. I could hear the sound of something wet hitting concrete, like a tail. Aira pointed towards a box, and I understood, diving behind a large Amazon package. 

The wet slapping noises continued, all the way down the stairs, before my father appeared, a bloody apron over jeans and a shirt, dragging along a figure. It was another guy, lying on his stomach, blood spilling from his lips and nose, streaking down his bare torso. I had to slap my hand over my mouth. I could still see the guy’s legs, or what used to be his legs, twisted into something resembling a tail. 

His ears still looked human, the sharp points almost looked man-made. 

Dad dragged the boy across the floor, panting. “It's okay,” he told the boy who was half human. The guy was struggling to breathe, like a fish out of water. “Once your lungs have gotten used to the water, you'll adapt.”

When he yanked the boy by his grotesque legs slowly morphing into a tail, the boy coughed up something that dripped down his chin. His eyes were wide and unseeing, his arms dead weights by his side. 

Dad carried the boy up a ladder to the surface. I thought he was going to throw him in, but instead, my father pulled out a knife. 

“It's okay,” he kept telling the guy in sharp breaths, “I know it will hurt, but you won't be able to adapt if I don't do this.” I could see Aira watching, her hand over her mouth, as my father dragged the blade across the boy’s throat, slicing it open, and dumping him in the water. 

The boy sank, sharp red exploding around him, tainting the water. 

He was dead. 

His tail was limp, his arms dragging him down. 

Aira caught him, cradling the boy in her arms. 

Dad watched, a smile pricking on his lips. 

The boy jolted suddenly in Aira’s arms, his eyes shooting open, and when he breathed, he breathed by habit, clutching his chest, a stream of bubbles flew from his mouth. 

When the nameless boy caught hold of himself, he pounded his fists against the glass, lips parting in a silent cry. Dad ignored him, dumping fish guts into the water, and forcing him to eat them. 

It struck me why Falan and Aira were only alert when they didn't eat. 

My father was drugging their food, keeping them docile. 

He had cut their voices directly from their throat. 

Carved into their bodies, cruelly moulding them into my stupid fucking childhood fantasy. 

When my Dad left them, Aira tried to tell me to stay to help her calm down the new merman, who kept pounding his fists against the glass. But I think part of her wanted me to hunt down her companion. I knew from the panicked glances she kept sending me that she was worried for him. 

Dad said his office was out of bounds when I was a kid, and I never thought much of it. 

When I pushed through the door, which was surprisingly unlocked, I realized *why*. 

All around me, bathed in clinical white light, were towering tanks filled with both human and fish parts; floating torsos and severed heads, victims no longer with identities. 

Dad was studying how to combine the two. His notes were strewn everywhere, screwed up and thrown in an overflowing trash can, and pinned to the wall. 

I found Falan pinned to a surgical table, a tube stuck down his throat. 

The human man cruelly twisted into something *inhuman*, and yet my father was sadistic enough to continue the facade, leaving the seaweed entwined in his curls, like he was a circus act.

There was a sensor above him, every movement he made setting off a sprinkler, soaking him. It was when he *didn't* move, which glued me to the spot. When his tail dried up, I panicked, reaching to wave my arm in front of the sensor. 

Instead, however, to my shock, his tail started to change, contorting and morphing into *something* that resembled legs, but were more grotesque, cruelly stitched to his torso in a horrific attempt to change from a mermaid into a human boy.

When the sensor activated, soaking him again, Falan’s body jolted, and he choked up splattered red splashing the tube.

His eyes flickered open, and he opened his mouth to speak.

But his words were gibberish, his voice a incomprensible hiss. 

I remembered how to move. 

Police. 

That was my first thought. 

I needed to get the cops. 

I tried to leave, stumbling over to the door, but something caught my eye. 

Another tank, and floating inside it, an all too familiar face. 

But he wasn't supposed to be so limp, so *wrong.*

Unmoving. 

His body had long since decomposed, and yet pieces of flesh still remained, still my big brother, and yet his body wasn't.

His body was cruelly ripped apart and stitched together, a mutilated fish tail attached to his torso.

His skin was covered in mismatched scales, like a virus taking over, shredding him apart, only leaving a slimy, green tinged substance coating him. 

Harvey was dead. 

But the thing stitched to him, entangling decomposing flesh, was still *alive*. 

I got out of there, and then the house in four single breaths. 

I ran home.

I woke up yesterday unable to breathe, this time choking up blood. Mom wasn't there.

When I stepped into the shower, I pieced together my thoughts and what exactly I was going to tell the cops, without sounding crazy. 

But when my fingers grazed the skin of my torso, just below my breast, I could feel three singular gashes in my skin.

Gills. 

When I felt the other side, there they were, splitting my flesh apart, warm to the touch, and yet somehow feeling natural. 

I can't believe I'm saying this, but being in water feels better. I can finally breathe. 

But I find myself stumbling when I'm trying to walk. 

I keep getting out of breath, and my skin feels too dry. Like it's sucked of moisture. 

I tried to get into the basement earlier, and unsurprisingly, it's locked. There's no sign of Mom or Dad. The only thing I have right is Mom’s stupid pet fish. 

I feel like I'm suffocating on air. 

You have to help me.

A mathematician, a physicist, and an engineer are all challenged to prove Fermat’s Last Theorem. After a long night of heavy work and espressos, they all fall asleep in the lab.

The **mathematician** dreams of an elegant proof written on a blackboard. In a flurry of symbols, he manages to derive a solution. But as he reaches for the final piece of chalk, the symbols rearrange themselves, disappearing into thin air. He wakes up, sighs, and says, ""It was all so beautiful… and then gone.""

The **physicist** dreams of a huge collider experiment designed to test Fermat’s theorem by measuring hypothetical prime-related particles. The experiment produces reams of data, and just as the computer spits out a promising result, he wakes up. ""It would’ve worked,"" he mumbles, ""if only we had a billion-dollar budget.""

The **engineer** wakes up next. He grabs a napkin, scribbles down, ""For any n>2n > 2n>2, there are no positive integers a,b,a, b,a,b, and ccc that satisfy an+bn=cna\^n + b\^n = c\^nan+bn=cn. Proof: see Fermat's margin."" Satisfied, he gets up and heads out for coffee.

The colleague asks, “So… what does ‘GNU’ stand for?”

“GNU’s Not Unix.”

“Okay… but what does that stand for?”

He’s funny, good-looking, and we clicked almost instantly in our conversations. We’ve gone on a few dates, but now I’m starting to notice some things that are making me uneasy. I’m not sure if I’m overthinking or if these are actual red flags.

First, he’s super intense. After just a few dates, he started calling me “his girl” and mentioning things like “when we move in together.” It was cute at first, but now it feels like he’s getting way ahead of himself. He’s also started showing up at places he knows I’ll be – like my usual coffee shop or my favorite park. I didn’t think much of it the first time, but now it’s happened a few times, and he just casually “bumps into me.”

What really threw me was when he brought up details about my life that I hadn’t told him. Like, he knows where I work, even though I’ve never mentioned the exact place, only my industry. When I asked him how he knew, he said he just “guessed” from clues I gave, but it didn’t sit right with me.

I don’t want to assume the worst, but I’m feeling more uneasy each time we meet. He’s sweet and seems genuinely interested, but something about his behavior just feels… off. I don’t want to accuse him of anything without cause, but I’m wondering if I should start setting boundaries or even cut things off. Has anyone else dealt with this? How do you figure out if it’s real or if you’re just overthinking?",2,1730859066.0,dating_advice,7,1.0,False

This last week has been the toughest since I started actively losing weight again since August. I was consistently averaging about 1350cal per day, I shot at a lower end due to having a WFH job and being a full time mom to a young kid not in school yet, too.

My grandma passed away last week, and we were extremely close. On the day she passed, I went over my limit at around 2200 calories and couldn’t keep myself below 1600 for the following two days. Today I will probably land at around 1400cal. I weighed at 186lbs back on Oct 11, I’m at 184.6lbs today after the scale showing 191lbs the last couple days.

I feel like I should be lower based on the caloric deficit I have kept to up until last week. I also was on my period last week, and on a plane twice in under 24hrs for 3hrs at a time. I just feel so drained and am really tempted to rely on food as a comfort like I always have during times of distress. I just want to cry into a fully comforting homemade coffee with all the creamer I want and hot chocolate mixed in and a giant croissant on the side and consume an entire chocolate pie afterwards.

I haven’t been able to exercise for over a week just because I’ve been busy and exhausted. I lost an entire night of sleep on Thursday. I’ve just taken a huge hit, but feel the pressure and shame of not doing enough to stick to my goals, of the cheat days I overate on.

Feel free to direct message me if you need help.



Day 1: Good Vibes & Good Times at a Tropical Coastal Town



Start your tour to Colombia in the Caribbean town of Santa Marta. Although there are some relics of historic architecture, Santa Marta is best used as a base from which to make a daytrip to Tayrona National Park. At least on the weekends, Santa Marta boasts a very vibrant nightlife scene, with performers in the main square and people walking the streets checking out local bands playing inside the restaurants. We are to take a guided tour in the early evening.



Day 2: The Country’s Most Beautiful Sands & Shore Reached by Horse



Before relocating by land to the colonial city of Cartagena, we make a daytrip from Santa Marta to Tayrona National Park. Upon arrival, we go on a horseback ride to reach what is considered the prettiest beach in all of Colombia. After walking to a viewpoint and swimming, we take a boat ride along the scenic coast to return to Santa Marta.



Day 3: Dipping in an Active Mud Dome & Caribbean Culture



Our day starts with a daytrip to El Totumo Volcano. There we dip inside its mud pool and are then scrubbed by an experienced local. After being washed down, we return to Cartagena and explore. Characterized by beautiful balconies, rich architecture, stone-paved alleyways, charming cafes and romantic restaurants, Cartagena is undoubtedly Colombia’s showcase destination.



Day 4: An Architecturally Impressive Place to See



We spend the day exploring Cartagena. This UNESCO-designated city grows on us rather quickly: cheerful and colorful sites, ambiance, food, and a great nightlife scene. Its landmarks and colonial streets will enchant you.



If you have more time, consider adding a daytrip from Cartagena to the Rosario Islands. Although there is not anything specific to see, spending the day snorkeling and going from tropical island to tropical island puts a smile on most people's face.



Day 5: The Scenic Landscape We All Dream About



We relocate by flight from Cartagena to the city of Pereira and immediately head to Cocora Valley. There we find the most stunning mountainous landscape the country has to offer. There we also have the opportunity to take photos with artistic objects (flower displays, a colorful car, a tall hand statue, etc.). We are then taken to a colonial town called Salento. There we walk the historic streets and get views from attractive lookout points.



Day 6: Natural Warm Pools, Waterfalls & Historic Villages



There is a lot to see before relocating by flight from Pereira to the city of Medellin. Our morning starts with a visit to a coffee plantation. There we are provided with a guided tour followed by samplings of some of the region's best coffees. We are then taken to the colonial town of Filandia. There we are provided with a guided tour as well as walk up to a stunning lookout point. We are then taken to a thermal pool located in the village of Thermales. There we relax in the naturally warm waters before checking out the waterfall.



Day 7: Flightseeing Over a Landmark Giant Rock with Calm Seas All Around



We make a daytrip from Medellin to the colonial town of Guatape. First, we head to a nearby natural attraction known as Piedra del Peñol. There we take a flightseeing tour over this giant rock and the calm waters surrounding it. We then head back to town and are provided with a guided tour. When we return to Medellin, we are to take a guided nightlife tour. There are few places on Earth that have a nightlife as vibrant as here, spreading in every direction for several blocks.



Day 8: A Destination World Renowned for Passion, Fashion & Dancing



Before relocating by flight to Bogota, we spend the whole day exploring Medellin. We take a cable car ride to visit the most popular lookout point. We visit the downtown area, home to churches, parks, street stalls and some historic buildings featuring decorative interiors. We also head to what was once the most dangerous neighborhood in Colombia, if not in the world. Today, it is an area which symbolizes peace. It hosts several art galleries and a museum which displays objects of devices used during times of war. Above this neighborhood is a nice lookout point, reached by escalator. While we are there, hopefully a music band and/or a dance group will be performing. They bring a lot of good energy to the area.



Day 9: A Church Built within the Tunnels of a Salt Mine & Colorful Cobblestone Streets



We make a daytrip from Bogota first to the colonial town of Villa de Leyva and then to the Salt Cathedral. Along with Barichara (which is relatively far away from the country's highlights), Villa de Leyva is the prettiest of Colombia's small historic towns. It is best explored on foot. The Salt Cathedral is an underground Roman Catholic church built within the tunnels of a salt mine 200 metres underground in a halite mountain. It is a tourist destination and a place of pilgrimage in the country.



Day 10: The Nation’s Version of Beverly Hills as well as a Charming Main Square



We spend the day checking out the capital of Colombia. Highlights include a viewpoint called Montserrat, the Gold Museum and the Cathedral. Nonetheless, Bogota's historic attractions are not its greatest draw. The city features relatively wealthy neighborhoods, comparable to Beverly Hills in the United States. We spend time in the area checking out the restaurants, shops and nightlife. Locals dress to impress in this district of Bogota. Prepare to go people-watching.

I didn’t even want to drink. I did it due to boredom. I have so much free time I don’t even know what I want to accomplish or even if I should seek to accomplish shit anymore..

Here’s what I noticed:

When I didn’t drink- 

I abused coffee. Felt like shit due to the caffeine. I ate less healthy than I do when I drink. Impacted my mood. Consumed more of the garbage trash fast food and restaurant food that America provides. Arguably more poisonous is it to eat battered wings and curly fries than to drink a beer. I seriously believe that. Either way, I didn’t feel the best although I did notice I had much more clarity around the 2 1/2 week point. Everything was a bit brighter but I didn’t necessarily feel better 


When I did drink-

I’m way more lackadaisical and less in my head overall. I did feel more tired a few days when I woke up but that’s about it. Still worked out daily. And actually ate much more healthy.. only real whole food. No processed garbage. Could it have been a timing coincidence? Probably. But who knows. Also I quit coffee, soda, and added sugar while I drink. Which just highlights that I’m probably seeking a single dopamine rush and when I can’t get one, I go to another. I felt less bright, maybe a bit more annoyed on average. But still actually felt as happy as I did before the 26 day break. It’s weird.

My conclusion-

Well… I could be an alcoholic, or I could just not be that affected by alcohol in general. I’m
Actually still drinking right now and today I worked out for 2 hours straight like fuckin Ric Flair. Either way. I don’t know, just wanted to get your opinions on this type of behavior. I’m 26 soon and look like I’m 20 apparently. I like alcohol for the social confidence boost, not for the taste. But if you have had a terrible experience with it. Tell me to warn me so I can slow down. Overall, I believe alcohol is over-exaggerated in its bad effects. Especially the light shit I drink like beers seltzers and occasional wine or mixed vodka.

I’m having fewer coffees in addition to what I have every morning, and it’s helping. I’m also not having the kind of iced tea that’s as almost as strong as coffee, anymore, aka the restaurant iced tea if you know what I mean. It‘s going better, even though I still have to cut back a lot more on the caffeine until I’m down to my 150-mg-a-day goal. I’m not even close to that yet, because I just started, and it’s gradual.

The soda is immediately going away, because I’m not addicted (yet), wouldn’t even have one daily on average, let alone addictive amounts every single day, and don’t want that to happen. I highly doubt anyone who was already addicted to soda, literally, like drinking 14 or more a week, could immediately give it up, but I can, because I clearly don’t.",8,1730858008.0,CongratsLikeImFive,2,1.0,False

Thank you to all of you.,"Hi everyone, I am new to this sub (only been here for 2 months). I just want to say thanks to all of you on the posts about tips, hacks, and knowledge about laparoscopy. I did not expect EVER that I would have a period that is not painful. I just want to share my regiment/ protocol, basically all the stuff I have been implementing.

This is my first month without period pain and I am in total shock. I only needed to take 2 painkillers today and I had the energy to do some small chore around the house. This was LIFECHANGING compared to the pain that I had to deal with my whole life. 

\- I go to a chiropractor and a pelvic floor PT for pain management in my low back and my pelvic myofascial pain. I practiced diaphragmatic breathing and learned a lot of massaging technique. 

\-I started taking vitamin C, D2, Magnesium Glycinate (relaxes smooth muscle), a multivitamin, fish oil

\-fresh Ginger with apple juiced 4 times a week  (ginger being a CGRP inhibitor and suppresses prostaglandin synthesis, sometimes even prescribe to help with nausea after chemo-therapy)

\-drink green tea now instead of coffee for the l'theanine and calming the nervous system 

\-I also got tested for iron deficiency, found out I have low ferritin and started supplementing (read some interesting link between estrogen and hepcidin)

\-changing my salt into iodized salt (I don't eat milk and seafood a lot, thought I was deficient) 

\-changed out all my plastic dish scrubber/ cutting board/ bowls, avoid using non-stick pan, I use a ceramic one now 

\-clear out my allergen from my environment (dust), so I vacuumed my room and washed my sheet weekly to reduce histamine 

\-ate much more cruciferous vegetables (almost eat none before), had dark chocolate daily

\-figured out that my mattress was too soft, which gave me back pain, changed into one with more back support

\-raspberry leaf tea, blackberry tea with zinc, chamomile and lavender tea, sometimes licorice tea

\-only have one pound of red meat per week, other animal protein are organic

\-avoid perfumes, only use it when I am in social circumstances (some perfumes have paraben)

\-avoid added sugar the best I can, avoid almost all milk product, avoid all soy product unless it is in sauces, avoid gluten (except for sweet treats like cookie), avoid icy drinks (a concept in Chinese Medicine)

\-make sure my body is warm and wear extra jacket at all times, two lymphatic massage a week 

\-also these are the other supplements that I have not tried: curcumin, DIM, vita, resveratol, Co-enzyme 10, berberine, inositol

  
At this point I don't know which ones worked...but I am so thankful for this community because I got a lot of inspiration from the posts here. Hope this helps anyone out there with the pain.

Quick break down of my journey, i had RNY 3 years ago, I am 5""4 and started at 242lbs. I lost most of my weight in first 6 months by month 8 I hit 130lbs and I have maintained so far. I do cardio at lease 3 times a week and weight training twice a week. 

Only food i cant eat is dairy 😫. Aside from that I eat anything just a low amount of course. I have NEVER been a big drinker of any fluids, never drank coffee, tea,pop or alcohol. My drink of choice was milk, apple juice and water. Pre and post surgery I drink about 500ml or less 😭😭 its really bad.

Now to my issue, I am so bad with staying on top of my vitamin. I will not take them for months then i start getting leg cramps which is my oh no moment and I start taking my vitamins. I have tried putting them on night table, kitchen, bathroom! I feel weird taking them at night as I barely drink and i am definitely not drinking overnight. When i do take my vitamins my urine is bright yellow like almost glow in the dark 🤣. I know this is your body rejecting the excess that my body has not absorbed. 

I am ooking to see how you guys remember vitamins? Any tricks... 

Next is NSAID advil cream. I get bad migraines obviously cant take NSAID products but in the US they now have this Advil cream that can help migraines, the cream is obviously External use, have any of you been told by dr you could not use?

He LAID on the horn, and with the windows open started screaming, “what the fuck are you doing! Go! Fucking go!”…the car was driving slow (and apparently swerving but I didn’t see that) and he then sped up, and cut in front of them on a no passing lane.
Five minutes went by and he was silent. 
I honestly had been horrified since the start of his outburst, when he was screaming and laying on the horn. I said to him, “so, there were two ways you can react to that type of…” and before I could finish he FREAKED OUT. He started saying, “oh you want to start? Are you seriously doing this?!?!” Then was irate and started screaming at me all the way home. 

Some context here: he has in the past acknowledged that he has anger issues. He has screamed at me in the past and freaks our dogs out. All I want when we DO fight is to talk to him in a calm manner but he just. Cannot. Do it.

I lived in a tiny apartment. I didn’t even own a car. I worked a simple coffee-house job and made minimum wage and lived off of my tips. 
I looked forward to Tuesdays and Thursdays for ladies night and karaoke. I didn’t have a cell phone or a credit card. I didn’t know what the heck a 401k was for, nor did I care. I barely had an email and I realized it was the most free I have ever been, and today is one of those kinds of days where I just wish that I could have appreciated it more. I would’ve been kinder to myself. I would have nurtured myself more. I wouldn’t have gotten mad over so many stupid things. Or wasted energy on the trivial and mundane. 
I would have been more present and enjoyed it. 
Don’t get me wrong. I appreciate my life and what I have now, but adulting is hard work. It’s every damn day and there is no rest for the weary or the wicked and sometimes, just sometimes I miss the Carefree days of my misspent youth.

I want to share my story and see if this sounds like a vegan who has eaten meat vs. just being food poisoning over something like bad onions.

So later in the evening I ate what I thought was an impossible Whopper. Mind you I was insanely hungry so I wolfed it down without thinking and something felt.... Off about it when it dropped. But I figured it was just since I hadn't eaten all day and inhaled a burger...

So I hang with my buddy for a few hours and go home and go to sleep. Sometime around 4am I wake up and sharted a little bit... Could tell something was churning but I wasn't ready to get up. 

So I got up finally and shat liquid for a good half hour. After this I went into town to get a coffee. I could tell my stomach still wasn't right but I thought it was just more diarrhea.... But then the nausea and stomach pain hit.

I've been sick before, I've had the stomach flu, probably had minor food poisoning once or twice... Let me tell you NOTHING has compared to this pain. I threw up a few times. I could feel some of the burger coming up. I had hot flashes followed by cold sweats and multiple moments of having to run to the bathroom. After one throw up sometimes I would briefly feel better .... Only to have the stomach pain return. 

I finally decided it was enough to go to the ER but had to have a friend take me in.

They determined it was a mixture of dehydration and food poisoning. I had explained I was vegan and was pretty sure I might've eaten real meat... The doctor did not take me seriously and said ""just eating meat wouldn't cause you to be this sick""

Meanwhile I haven't eaten meat in almost ten fucking years ....... UGH. 

All they did was IV me fluids and give me some anti nausea meds. after some hours there, I got sent home and pretty much slept on and off the whole rest of the fucking day. Occasionally throwing up. Luckily the meds had a side effect of making me very sleepy so I pretty much on and off slept from 4pm to like ..... 7am. 

There were points I had thought maybe something was going seriously wrong inside of me .... I felt like almost near death at some brief moments where I'm seriously asking myself will I ever leave this hospital?

I've bounced this off multiple people and even a handful of my friends who saw me yesterday said it looked SO MUCH worse than normal food poisoning. 

So I wanted to bounce this off the vegan sub. Am I crazy? Have you ever had real beef accidentally and suffered similar effects?

Also should I contact burger king? I didn't save any of the burger so I can't prove if it was or was not beef... No idea what to do from here other than just be happy I'm not dead and not in pain anymore.",23,1730856212.0,vegan,13,0.83,False

So I asked few other friends and I was told it's not that normal for how she's treating me. But I just got to know from other co workers that she's still with her husband and  kids. I thought she has separated and lives alone. How did other coworkers know about her family while I still don't for the past 1 year? I am very hurt now. I thought we are moving forward but no, she's still happy with her family. I need to confront her soon but I have to risk a nice friendship. Or at least I can set expectations on how close we should be and remain friends but not as close. Maybe to her, what we were doing weren't close. But I dare to say she wouldn't tell her husband about me.


--Previous Post--
Help decipher if I am a friend or love interest? 

Scorpio male here and person in question is Scorpio female. Same birth year but 2 days older than me.

Started out as co workers. I feel no crush nor any love interests in the beginning. We progressed into friends outside of work. But our quick coffee breaks or lunch were mostly within office hours. Once we went out outside of work to celebrate our birthdays and three occasions we just met for dinner elsewhere. Another time only the two of us went for a walk on a Saturday for a company fitness challenge.

What we did to each other:
I often text her end of day or morning just to say HI. One time we managed to meet up mid point and walk to office together.
She knew about my favorite waffle and drink and offered to buy me and placed in pantry fridge with my name on it. Out of the blue, she bought a almond drink for me. When I said I was injured she gave me some ointment on my table and another instance she wanted to send medicine to my home but I refused to give address. She jokingly said she could find out from the HR system as she's from HR. These were her sweet gestures and of course I did always offer to buy her coffee. She's also often feeling shy to come over my work desk.

December last year I bought a sleeping owl as a sleeping aid. She liked it as I noticed she couldn't sleep well. There are details I remember of her but I find she remembers more details about me than myself of her.

I know and feel she's hiding her marriage separation and also having a young kid. She's still legally married.

My feelings came when she initiated a farewell outing just me and her. It was such a nice outing walking the coast, a lunch date, and then a movie. She often joked about breaking off this friendship once I leave the company.

Recently, I video call her a few times during her solo trip. One thing shocked me was when I couldn't send her off at the airport, I initiated a video call at the airport. When time comes I chickened out (who am I to video call someone like this right?) but she immediately video called me and it was the best time of my life. Like out of so many friends why she accepted my offer to video call?

During her solo trip, she also send photos of herself inside and one casual selfie. I don't know if she sent it to her other friends. I also get to video call her and sort of accompanied her when she's alone somewhere during the trip. When I asked her about the trip or meal, she would send me photos of the place or food.

One day during her trip, she didn't reply me for half the day. I know she's safe. At night I managed to video call her when she's heading back to hotel. She said she was with an ex boss and kids the entire day. I told her I was worried for her.

The next day when she was on her way to airport, she texted me telling me how sweet I was to her and that she's sorry I was worried for her during her solo trip - referencing to that day she didn't reply my messages.

Question:
Is she just being nice to all her close friends or what? I don't dare to move forward for fear of ruining the friendship. Sometimes I am confused with her signals sometimes I feel her signals are just friends. Not much physical touch except one time she jokingly slapped my arm. I didn't dare to touch her in anyway as I am just enjoying this friendship and don't want to test the boundaries yet. Her farewell gift to me was a soft toy with a knitted sweater with my name on it. She also gave me a caricature she asked someone to draw during her solo trip. I am confused..",2,1730855731.0,Scorpio,0,1.0,False

I wish I had a group of girls that I could go on trips with, get brunch, go dancing with, those kind of things. Have I missed my chance for girl group friendships like that? I feel like they usually get solidified in college and unfortunately I had no such luck then. I’ve tried getting my friends to be friends with each other and hanging out, but they all seem to have their own individual groups and don’t really seem as enthusiastic to do group activities with each other since they have established groups already (maybe they just don’t mesh together)… ",6,1730855608.0,AskWomenOver30,4,0.81,False

1gkmn1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/1gkmn1c/my_story/,My Story,"Used to smoke a lot of weed and even did some party drugs when I was 16-17 years old. One day the weed started giving me really bad anxiety to the point where it was almost certain to induce an anxiety attack every time so I stopped all drugs and weed for about 5 years. During this time nicotine and alcohol were completely fine. When I did start smoking weed again I had to do it in extremely small quantities other wise i would have an anxiety attack, but really enjoyed the high so I would just do a small amount and enjoy myself. This continued for a couple of years but suddenly I started to feel a constant fatigue throughout the day and went and got checked, all my labs came back normal and I wrote it up as seasonal depression that didn't start until later in life. 

WARNING GRAPHIC

At this point I'm 27 still drink alcohol, use nicotine, and occasionally smoke small amounts of weed. Overall I was pretty fine for the most part and my anxiety was manageable. One day at a music festival I took an edible that was 10x more than what I thought it was and it sent me over the edge I went to the medic tent and had a terrible night, but took a xanax and it helped a lot. I fought demons for about 6 hours and then everything was fine. I didn't think to much of it but then the next week at work I saw two people fall 120' from a scaffold, one person hit the ground and died instantly the other person landed on a pile of conduit and some how lived. I was on 2 hours of sleep when this happened and i never do good on little sleep.

About 2 weeks later my life fell apart, the fatigue was 10x worse than it ever has been, I have DPDR 24/7 for 6 months now, I constantly feel like medically there is something wrong with me, I have a headache that idk how to describe it feels like my head is sour or spoiling idk how to describe it, sleep is terrible (but has never been great even before all this), I wake up every morning with this terribly strong anxious feeling in my sternum, chest is always tight, and constant terrible thoughts. 

  
I think the edible experience and the accident at work caused my nervous system to shoot into overdrive and i just have not been able to come down since. I have since started an anti-depressant (lexapro) and have been on it for just under a month. I think it has made everything a lot worse, the doctor told me their would be an adjustment period where this might happen. I am going to keep pushing with this medication for another 2 weeks because I really want to find some relief. 

  
I do everything right, i eat well, i dont drink or use nicotine or coffee anymore , i workout, i just got a new job that doubled my salary, i have great support, and i still feel terrible literally from the second i wake up until the second i fall asleep. 

idk how much longer I will be like this, idk if it will last another week, another year, or another 20 years, but ik one day i will feel back to normal as long as i keep pushing and all of you will too. 



Looking back on the last 6 months since this has gotten drastically worse; a couple of things I wish i would have done sooner:

\-Go and see a doctor and get extensive bloodwork earlier. This will help you know that you are okay and let you start focusing on understanding your anxiety better. 

\-Talk to someone about what you are going through, i am fortunate because i have some amazing friends and was able to open up to them about everything and this helped me a lot. I actually found out a lot of them were going through similar situations and now we talk a lot more often about this, you never know what someone is going through these people have been friends with me for over 10 years and i never knew they were going through something similar. 

\-Understand and practice breathwork. When you are pretty anxious but it is manageable use this time to practice your breathing and meditation. Think of it like using a weighted vest to train. When I get anxious i welcome it and get almost excited to practice breathwork (when its not to terrible).

\-Read and study about what anxiety is and get smart about the symptoms you are experiencing. Some links below for people and books that have helped me tremendously so far.

\-The Depersonilization Manual. This one helped me by far the most because my most burdensome                  symptom is the chronic DPDR. Which not many sites talk about. He does a great job of explaining what it is in some videos and then he has a bunch of people on to talk about their recovery journey which helps a lot because you can relate to them. This one is from an NFL player but he has every kind of person on so you can always find someone to relate too. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEHGC0zxDU&t=2377s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEHGC0zxDU&t=2377s)

\-Dr Tracey Marks She is an actual doctor and gives great explanations on the science behind anxiety. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q\_vsBZbnuGM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_vsBZbnuGM)

\-Lucinda Basset. She is an author and when i was at my lowest i found her book ""From Panic to Power"" in the bottom shelf of my parents basement. This book made me tear up multiple times because it was so relatable to what i was going through and made me feel so sane that other people feel the way that i do. It was written in 1995 and it still holds up 100%, i have since given it to a friend and she said it had the same effect on her. I HIGHLY recommend this book. It was the first book i ever read from start to finish i hate reading. 

\-[Shaan Kassam](https://www.youtube.com/@byebyepanic) on youtube does a great job explaining how symptoms of anxiety manifest and how you make them worse with your thoughts, there is an example video but his whole youtube is great [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hQwD5Yf92s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hQwD5Yf92s)

I have dealt with anxiety since 17 I am now 28. In the last 6 months it has gotten extremely debilitating, i took a month of short term disability, i have since returned to work but showing up everyday is hell. But i am going to keep pushing because the only way out is forward. I believe in all of you that are on your own journey. I have never posted on here but after typing this i feel a lot better for now. The people that are fighting this are some of the most badass people on the planet you are fighting through something most people will never understand. Keep fighting. Love you all.

sure I know there's a kiss at the end of the game since I spoiled it for myself because I was getting fed up with how slow it was but its definitely not worth continuing his romance. It honestly just sucks. I liked Reyes's romance in Andromeda more than I liked this and that's sad because that one was really cut short and yet somehow they did it better than Lucanis's.

During fasting I'm drinking water, black tea (Ceylon black tea or Pu'ehr tea), or black coffee (mostly decaf, caffeinated makes me anxious). It has occurred to me that a good detoxification tea would probably also be beneficial.

I have a relatively healthy diet, consisting of meats, vegetables and a little bit of rice. Beef has been starting to feel too heavy and I'm craving fish more, but reacting badly to most fish outside of salmon (I have a LOT of intolerances) and fish is too expensive here to eat exclusively. 

I had been in the habit of consuming a lot of carbs and sugars, but I glance at a packet of sugar and gain weight, so I'm cutting sugars as much as I can and already, I can see a bit of a difference.

My skin is clearer, my dark circles are not as dark, I've already lost a couple of pounds. I'm less bloated. 

I'm still lower on energy. 

Today I broke my fast with oatmeal with two tablespoons of canned coconut milk, a tablespoon of ghee, a cup of caffeinated tea with coconut milk and felt sick to my stomach for a couple hours afterwards.

Ate a couple pieces of ginger and that helped. 

Anyway it brought to mind that I should be choosing what I'm eating more carefully than I have been. Suggestions and advice are appreciated!",3,1730855069.0,intermittentfasting,1,1.0,False

So everytime I bring up suicidal ideation their response is to being hospitalised right away. Which I am totally against because there I am not safe from killing myself (the pajamas they gave me that was supposed to break in case of suicide attempt didn't break when I tried it on my leg). I was with people way more sick than me yelling all day. We almost ate nothing letting us get hungry all day, we all couldn't wait to eat and even men whom require more calories ate next to nothing and we couldn't share food if we didn't like something and wanted to give it to someone else so we did in secret when nurses and lunch ladies weren't looking. The nurses had no respect for treating all of us like kids or neglect us and ignored us when we had a problem saying ""it'll go away go sleep in your room"" sorry? You always felt like you were bothering them. The only persons I keep a good image is one of the lunch lady who hugged me when I told her why I was suicidal and a younger nurse than me who did the same. We weren't allowed to go outside we had to wait for the psychiatrist approval and once I got it 2 weeks later I looked crazy, I wasn't used to the sounds of the city anymore(cars,people talking). I ate pastries drink coffee and later soda this day. When I came back there I hid chocolate I bought and kept looking at the window all day everyday. Nobody cared if you killed yourself or not, nobody came to check if you're okay in your room. I am sorry I know for some of you being hospitalised help them tremendously but in my city and in my hospital I just think that's lazy in a ""we don't want to care for you and for your suffering just go get...hospitalised"" way. I went to a clinic twice instead of my city hospital and it was way better, the problem being they're expensive.",2,1730854763.0,BipolarReddit,17,0.75,False

The group waves and I step back onto the curb. Lisa cranks the window closed as Alexei starts the van’s rumbly engine.

“See ya when we get back!”

The glass reaches the top of the window and they drive away. I start walking while I watch my friends roll over the crest of the hill, the van’s engine fading to ambient nighttime city noise. I was invited to go with them. Alexei and Lisa’s band had planned a last minute tour out west. Vancouver, Victoria, couple of other places. Some of our friends were tagging along to help out.

“You should come! It’d be cool to have someone who could take pictures! There’s an extra seat in the van if you don’t mind it being a little crowded.” 

I would not’ve minded. This is the exact kind of thing I’d always wanted to do, and against all odds the opportunity had landed right in front of me. I would’ve had to pay for food and stuff, and pitch for accommodations, but I could’ve made it work. None of my would’ve’s and could’ve’s mattered though, since I didn’t get all my shifts covered anyway. I asked all my co-workers but it’s Canada Day weekend. Nobody wants to work in the liquor store on Canada Day weekend.

“Fucking stupid Canada Day. People and their fucking liquor.”

I get to the top of the hill and my frustration is dulled ever so slightly by the majesty of the city skyline twinkling in the distance. 

“At least I’m here.”

I’d arrived in the city a few years earlier at age nineteen. Leaving my hometown feels like my biggest accomplishment in life. In fact, I’m not sure how I’ll ever top that. A lot of people from my high school tried moving to the city, but most ended up going back. Not me though, I’m still here. Sure I live in a mouldy rooming house and hate my job, but I’m finally free from my hometown. Considering how little respect I have for my landlord, nobody really tells me what to do anymore. Except at work. But at home I come and go as I please, eat what I want when I want, and I can have overnight guests as long as they’re quiet and don’t leave their shoes by the front door. 

I get to the station in time for the last train, but it never arrives. The digital schedule board appears to have given up. After about ten minutes of the arrival estimate not changing I get sick of waiting and start another long walk home. Luckily I’m a fast walker, efficient with my strides. I figure I should have about six hours of sleeping time before I have to get up for work tomorrow. Not bad.

“Maybe I should’ve just quit after all. They’re gonna have so much fun without me. Plus the pay is shit and my supervisor’s an asshole.” 

I stop the idea in its tracks. Nope. We don’t do that. If I want to quit I need to give at least two weeks notice. I need to leave on good terms if I ever want to get a better job. Come on Alison. We can be responsible or we can work here forever, those are the choices.

My internal monologue has morphed into mom’s voice. Familiar, comforting, yet firm. Maybe a little bit stern.

We don’t do that. We don’t do that.

Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot. I’m making good time. Trying to listen to the sounds of the city, but subconscious mom is talking over it. 

We don’t do that. We don’t do that. 

\-

“No! We don’t do that in the house.”

I’m roughly five years old. Mom sits up in her recliner to make sure I see how unhappy she is.

“What did I do?”

“You know. Don’t give me that.”

“I’m not allowed to say doofus?”

“You were yelling again. How many times do I have to tell you not to yell in my house?”

“I dunno.”

“It’s a rhetorical question, Alison. Just be quiet. Why don’t you go play downstairs. Play with your Barbies or something. You have so many toys, and yet you’re up here bugging me.”

“But I wanna hang out with you.”

“Well I’m napping. God doesn’t like it when you make noise while I sleep. Don’t you want to honour your father and mother like god says?”

“I dunno.”

“Well you have to. It’s important.”

My family is Catholic, but also sometimes Lutheran. I don’t know how much I like god. God has no way of knowing what it’s like to be a five year old girl because he’s always been an old man. He loves me but I wish he would stop telling me what to do. Life is hard enough without extra rules that don’t make any sense.

\-

“We don’t sit like that with skirts on. Come on honey, sit like a lady.”

“Why can I just sit normal?”

“Because, everybody will see your underwear.”

“I don’t care!”

“Well god cares. Come on now, be good so you can go to heaven one day.”

“If heaven is so great why can’t I just go there now?”

Mom hates that question. It makes her yell a bit sometimes so I try not to ask it very often even though I’d really like to know the answer. Why wouldn’t god like to see me sooner? Santa can tell if I’m good or bad already so why can’t god if his powers are stronger than Santa’s?

\-

“I don’t wanna leave yet!”

“Too bad, it’s late, your sister needs to go to bed.”

“But I was having fun!”

“Too bad. Maybe we can come back another time.”

“We never get to have fun!”

“Quit whining, your dad’s trying to drive.”

“Well maybe he should stop driving then so we can go back.”

“Alison, cut it out or we’ll leave you at the wine store with all the other whiny kids.”

Mom points to the place where she buys wine as we drive past it.

“Well at least I could have friends there!”

“Nope, the kids aren’t allowed to be friends. They make them sweep and mop floors all day.”

“Well we could still talk.”

“Nope, the kids get beaten if they talk. All they do is clean all day and then go to bed early and get up and clean again in the morning. And they can only eat liver and onions, for every meal.”

“Do they get to go home ever?”

“Maybe sometimes, if they behave well enough.”

“You can’t send me there! Please!”

“Well I guess you better listen to me then.”

“Is that why there’s bars on the windows?”

“Yup! They gotta keep all those whiny kids in somehow!”

Maybe she doesn’t understand how much I would hate having to live in the whine store. This isn’t something to laugh about. What if I’m too bad to ever get to go home? What if I talk by mistake? What if they hit me with a big spoon like grandma used to do to dad instead of normal spanking? I can’t get sent there. 

\-

“Mommy she took!”

“Alison! Whatever it is give it back.”

“Its a crayon but it’s my turn to use it.”

“Was your sister done with it?”

“No but she was using it forever!”

“Don’t whine, just give it back.”

“I’m so sorry mom! Please don’t send me to the whine store. Please.”

“Well give the crayon back and I won’t.”

I breathe a sigh of relief. I have to behave better. I need to try harder. 

\-

“Alison! We have to leave soon! You said you were getting dressed!”

“Yeah but I dunno if I wanna go. I really don’t feel like going to the church today.”

“Well you can either get dressed and come to the baptism, or we can drop you off at the wine store on our way there. Those are your choices.”

It can be hard to get words out when all the options are bad ones.

“Now what? What are you crying about?”

“Cause, I don’t wanna go live at the whine store. Please don’t make me go there mom, I’ll do anything.”

“Well then quit your crying and get dressed. Come on, hurry up, we have to leave.”

\-

“Come on! Hurry up hurry up hurry up.”

I’m twenty-two. I’m desperately trying not to vomit up my coffee while the densely packed LRT lurches through the intersection. Everyone sways and I throw up my mouth a little as the heavy-footed conductor stops at the platform. The feral crowd of seasonal tourists behind me forces me out the door before it has a chance to open all the way. I rush to the edge of the platform so I can puke into the century park water feature. My half digested multivitamin floats away as I mourn the loss of my morning caffeine. I’ve gotta start eating breakfast. While I’m dragging my exhausted body and mind to work my phone rings. I dread the thought of hearing about my friends’ trip, being told everything I’m missing.

“Hi, is this Alison?”

“Yup. Who’s this?”

“Hey! It’s Paul, from work. I hope it’s okay I got your number from the schedule book. Just wondering if you ended up finding someone to cover your shift?”

“Nope. Didn’t end up going.”

“Great! I mean, that sucks. But since you’re here anyway would you wanna take my shift tomorrow?”

Now I’m wishing it was my friends calling to tell me about their trip.

“Sure. What time?”

“Oh man you’re the best! It’s 11-7. Thank you so much! I’m going camping with some buddies for the long weekend. It’s gonna be sick. I’m glad you can cover for me. If I couldn’t find someone I was thinking I’d just quit. Fuck that place, am I right? Ted is such an asshole.”",1,1730854695.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False
1gkmg2i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gkmg2i,My experience with coffee dying the Birkenstock lutry,"Recently acquired a pair of the Birkenstock Lutrys and loved them to death, super comfy and the ability to go “sport mode” is awesome. My only issue was the color I got. Did my research on coffee dying and sent it. The color I wanted was exactly how it turned out! 

My process: 
Heated a pot of water to boil and dumped in half a tin (that’s all I had left) of café Bustello and about a cup of death wish coffee dark roast. Stirred it a bit and let it cool to room temperature. After that I strained out the coffee grounds and dumped the coffee into a large bowl, pulled the cork out of the shoes and put them in for about 20 mins. Took them out and dried them the best I could with a towel and then set them in front of a fan to dry. 

Couldn’t be happier with the result! Before and after shown above.

Any tips on how to maintain them after this would be appreciated!

Read Acurazine and watched a lot of YouTube videos.
Consensus was to try a 3x3 drain with Honda OeM fluid.I did it over the course of a week.first drain ,car drove  great for a couple of hours then it started slipping about a mile from the house and I limped home.
Second drain,car started sipping after about an hour.Had to turn the car off for a couple of minutes and then limped home with no more issues.
Third drain and filter change yesterday.Drove the car for about 5 miles and all was good.
This morning,drove a couple of miles to get coffee and while idling in drive thru shifted the gears 30 seconds each.All was good until reverse when there was a clang when I put it into that gear.Started slipping at about 40 miles an hour and rpm needle went crazy between 2-4000 rpm.limped home and after reversing trying to park by the curb by m house I shifted into drive and car didn’t move at all.Turned off for a minute ,started car back up and drive worked while I parked .
I kept the old fluid and third drain was still dark brown,almost as dark as the first two.No metal flakes or chunks.
I will test the TCC Solenoid tomorrow,but I am pretty disheartened.Looking more and more like tranny is shot.
I haven’t changed pressure switches,but would that really make a difference?T fluid hadn’t been changed by previous owner for 90k miles.

Hey! New to the group. I have three kids! 2yo daughter, and two (step) sons, 5, and 7. I need advice on how not to unsubscribe the son’s “mother”. I’m at a loss and I can’t even begin to think straight. So I met my bf last year in April and since then I got to know and LOVE all three boys. The only thing I hate is the ex wife/baby momma, now usually I hate that term but that’s what this woman is. Since meeting her, she’s not only taken it upon herself to constantly try to get emotional validation from my bf and insert herself in his life in many inappropriate ways, like asking to go to couples therapy with him after we started dating, but also in making up fake emergency’s to get his attention and claiming life unwanted to get him to give her attention. One of these times she said and I quote “I’m k*lling myself lol don’t let 5yo find my body wrapped in his favorite blanket.” She’s also always made any thing to do with the boys about her, examples: I called to mention 5yo might have iron deficiency and she brought up how she was born with the clap and it’s been an issue for her since. This brings me to what BOILS MY BLOOD! There was an instance where the 7yo got ahold of her pen and hit it, she laughed. When she threw the 5yo a birthday at her home with her roommate, roommates 3 kids, and roommates bf, there was dog feces and cat piss everywhere! At least 12 piles in one room. (Not an over exaggeration). But it get worse. She moved from that home claiming the roommate and her bf were doing things she didn’t approve of but wouldn’t say what. She later moved back like 2 weeks later. After that she married a man she had met once and lived across the country from, the second time meeting was the wedding! We didn’t even hear about him until they met for the first time and she was with someone else a week prior who was in prison.(mind you she will tell you her life story if you give her the time). After that she was trying to start a coffee truck business with her roommate. One day we got a call from her during her week with the boys and she was screaming about how her roommate was too bossy and they had an argument over how to correctly froth milk….she met us and we took the boys. She moved two days later.  One day while my bf was out of state for his job, I overheard the oldest say the word seggsy, and I thought I misheard, so I listened and sure enough he said it again. I then heard him say he wanted to reenact the kissing part and I went to the room. My heart was gone when I walked in and saw what I saw. Both boys were standing over my daughter and when I asked what they were doing, they said they were reenacting segs. When I asked on who, they got shy and said on a ball. There was no ball. So I warned them as calm as I could, if I ever heard them talk like that or catch them doing anything of the sort they would be grounded for a month. I went to cool down and took my daughter from the room. I explained what happened to my bf who was on FaceTime this entire time and when I calmed enough I went to speak to them. When I asked them where they learned to speak and act like that, they claimed their egg donor was watching “sex movies” in front of them. The oldest said it was about a vampire and there was a part with sex in it. We confronted her of course, but she denied it. Later on they confessed that the roommates oldest son who was 8, had been inappropriately touching them and that when they told their egg donor, she scolded the boy but that was all. They never specified how many times this happened but I’m not sure I want to know. My heart broke when I heard them describe how in great detail. Later on the egg donor left for 5 weeks to visit her now husband for their one year anniversary and made an excuse about car issues on his end she had to help with. We know she was lying because she told us it was the radiator and then claimed they quoted $25,000 to fix it. He drives an Audi but it’s not new and at least a few years old. During those 5 weeks the boys were happy and acted like kids again. But one day when I picked them up from school, the school therapist pulled me aside and informed me that the oldest threatened to stab another student and even drew a picture of the students home filled with water and his whole family covered in “tomato sauce” inside while he himself was outside with a knife also covered in sauce. When asked why he did this, he said he was upset and the student had annoyed him. I questioned him about it, and he said that violence was normal because mommy lets him play and watch violent things. We got him into the doctor who recommended a therapist because of course this was not normal behavior for his age and very serious. When the egg donor came back, she had them for 3 days when she stated she had an appointment and needed help getting the boys from school, unfortunately I had a very important doctors appointment myself. I have cervical cancer and am in remission but it’s very aggressive and I have frequent appointments. When we informed her, she said if we don’t figure it out they won’t go to school. We felt this unfair given her 5 week vacation and told her as much. She don’t budge, so we asked my bfs mom and like the saint she is, she said yes. When I picked the boys up from her home to bring to our home, the boys informed us they had been without car seats for a while with their egg donor, when we asked her about this, she confirmed and even defended herself. Her husband took it as far as to say “car seats don’t grow on trees” and to play the “we couldn’t afford it” excuse even though they had enough money to buy a new car, and take 3 cross country road trips in the last couple months. I argued she could’ve borrowed ours if it was that bad. She just kept giving excuses, I called the non emergent police that second and questioned as to what my options were, they said that if she was taking ours that we couldn’t do much since the issue was resolved and not still and active issue. I’m at a cross roads and I’m fuming. She’s not a good mother and I’m scared because I’m legally nothing to these boys. I may be their mother but I cannot do anything other than call cps, or the cops who have proven to be no help. We’ve talked to our lawyer about full custody and he’s flat out told us in our state unless we have a video of physical, seggsual, or drug related abuse happening we wouldn’t win because the state often sides with the mother.

Normally I can hyper-fixate for periods or work alongside an audiobook and get out 6-8 hours of work in a day. I’m losing so much time and barely handling 3 hours. It’s driving me nuts and I *have* to get more hours in. 

Not sure if this is still part of withdrawal or if I’m just experiencing baseline. Any thoughts or advice?",2,1730854069.0,ADHD,5,1.0,False

I was pregnant with my daughter and woke up one morning with blood everywhere. The doctors called it a threatened miscarriage but never told me the source. For the rest of the first trimester I had particles like brown coffee grinds and some tissue looking particles, but no one has ever clarified to me whether it was just a random occurrence or if there was another baby? There was also bleeding in between the particles/grinds.

When this had happened I was in my first trimester and I hadn’t had my first ultrasound yet. 

My daughter is now 2.5 years old, but I’m still conflicted about what that was. Any answers?",0,1730853690.0,pregnant,2,0.5,False
