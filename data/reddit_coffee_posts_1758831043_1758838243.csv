1nqk5xo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nqk5xo,"Dreams at out Dusk - Shamanami Tasogate. The lighter, heart pulling side of Seinen","I finished it and what a read! I feel like I should just get the flaw out the way first and admit that it was me. If your gonna read this great coming of gay story the most important element is that you as the reader give yourself over to the author.

Tasuku Kaname is like a 15 year old kid who think  he's gay. Or maybe he knows but either way that was an emotion or identity he was challenged by then he try to ran from and it culminated in seeing Anonymous, an actual mystery of a person that gave him insight into what he felt or what he was becoming. 

Thus starts a summer of;  for lack of a better term; Blossoming sexual identity.. Tasuku experiences the lgbtq community through those older younger and different from him. He learns from each mistake he makes cause just because he doesn't know if he's gay or not doesn't mean he infallible. He faces what he feels and what he says time and time again and he comes out on the other side a better person for it.

Something I really rated about this type of story telling was how the tasuku wasn't really forced to give big winding speeches about his feeling or what he intend. Some one more experienced will speak up or shut up and he gets the point that needed in that moment. 

He does fuck up but he recovers well cause he grows. Not only through action but through regret which I loved.

I had a theory on Somebody San being non binary or asexual and I was 50% right. And here identity was glue that held this shit together cause I was wonder what's going with this person that can cloud surf and loves coffee.

All in all...good read. Bit cliche that Tasuku would be a twink wedding planner; no?🤣 
Tsubaki I liked as the ""villian"" and as the romantic intrest and I rated how he broke down but he never stopped being a tease or kinda a villian in the coming of gay story.
If this is what the lighter side of Seinen has I'll be willing to give it a whirl. I don't know if I'm ready for hot steamy butt stuff but I wouldn't mind another romance or drama seinen series. 

The journey continues as I try to drown out ""deepest"" posts so guess I'll be sharing my musing or study sooner rather than later",1,1758838141.0,Seinen,0,1.0,False
1nqk56p,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1nqk56p/i_dont_know_if_my_parents_are_too_controlling/,I don't know if my parents are too controlling,"I'm not really sure where to begin with all this. I guess first of all, I should mention I'm 18, and will be 19 in 5 months. I live with my parents and I have no siblings. I haven't had a friend in 6 years. I cried often about how I would watch YouTube videos and take my parents' advice on how to communicate. I introduced myself, asked about people's days, and if I was lucky I got a phone number. I would text them, give them space, ask to go for coffee or to a movie. My parents grew tired of me crying. They always said in one form or another that I wasn't doing good enough. Not trying hard enough. So earlier this year my parents began sending me to therapy to get help with my social skills. I told her my way of initiating conversations, and she told me I was doing it correctly. My parents made me quit that therapist (who I actually really liked) and switched me over to a different therapist without telling me why. It was just ""she's not a good fit for you anymore."" I've never really argued against them in my life, so I just went along with it.   
I went to a second therapist. Yesterday (Sep. 24, 2025), I told her the same thing, how I make friends. I had been going to this therapist for about 2 months at this point, once a week. She shook her head and told me that I seem completely normal. Normal. I drove home thinking about that. I went to bed thinking about that. I eventually got out of bed and I had to tell my parents that I didn't want therapy anymore. I wasn't the problem; everyone else was. My parents were all like ""Oh, it's not you? We thought it was. We're keeping your future appointments though."" And that was the end of that.   
Today, they've set screentime in place for me. Again, I am 18 years old. They put screentime on my phone and I can only have a total of 2 hours a day. If I'm on it longer than that, then they have told me they will take my phone away. My computer luckily does not have any parental permissions, but even still, I am a legal adult. I have no responsibilities outside of doing college work online and chores around the house. I've been looking for a job since the beginning of this year and haven't been able to even get a reply back. My parents and I had an agreement that if I finished my responsibilities, I am free to do what I want with my day. However, they've broken this and I don't know why. Apparently it's because I have a severe temper. I do know I get angry easily, but I don't think 2 hours of screentime will fix that.   
I should explain that a majority of things I enjoy are on my phone/computer. I do freelance work, talk to online friends, and run my own YouTube channels, as well as moderate for a YouTuber. I've never been good at drawing, painting, or anything artistic. I have asthma so it's difficult to do sports. And I've been struggling to find a job. So now I'm incredibly limited in what I can do, both online and offline. And if I break my parents' rules, they will put both my phone and laptop in a safe. It's not the first time they've done that. They've been doing it since I was 14 if I go against their will in any way.  
At this point, I don't know if they're being too controlling. I know they love me and I love them. But I'm questioning their judgement. I'm not used to speaking up for myself or questioning why they do something. And the times that I have done it, I get name-called, yelled at. and told that I'm not the parent and should always listen to what they say.  
I'm not allowed to speak to my family members without telling my parents who I talk to and what I say (grandparents, aunts/uncles, cousins, etc.). I've hinted that I would like to move in with other family, but my parents told me I would never be allowed to do that. I don't have any friends irl, and the people I know online I don't trust enough to ask them if I could be their roommate. And I don't have a job to even afford an apartment or rent out a friend's place if I even asked them. I feel stuck and I'm not sure if what my parents control is worth moving out for.

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don’t mind where you are located don’t let the distance put you off 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Im not here for a quick one-liner or a throwaway message. Im here to build a story that feels immersive, clever, and exciting.The plot I have in mind is simple on the surface but full of tension. Two characters meet casually maybe a dinner, maybe a coffee, maybe even in a professional setting. At first, nothing looks unusual: polite conversation, laughter, subtle glances. But underneath, a power dynamic begins to grow. One of them knows exactly what they want, the other slowly realizes they are being guided, step by step, into someone else’s world.

What I’d love to explore in this RP is the **psychological game of dominance and submission without ever needing chains or cliches**. A smile can be more binding than a rope, a pause can be more commanding than a shouted order. By the end of the night, my character knows he is no longer leading the conversation he’s following, obeying, perhaps even grateful for it.

This doesn’t need to be just one scene. It can expand meetings in different places, a growing tension, moments of push and pull. I’m very open to plotting with a partner who enjoys clever writing, slow burn tension, and the kind of storytelling where anticipation is half the thrill.

I write in third person, can do multi-paragraph replies, and I love partners who bring ideas as much as I do. If you’re someone who enjoys subtle control, playful or serious dominance, and want to build something layered lets talk.",1,1758838018.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

1nqk0z3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHome/comments/1nqk0z3/down_jacket_vs_bomber_jacket_whats_better_for_city/,Down jacket vs bomber jacket: what's better for city?,"Hey everyone! I've been living in the city for quite a while now, and I've gone through my fair share of jackets trying to find the perfect one for urban life. Today, I want to share my experience with both down jackets and bomber jackets, since I get asked about this a lot.

First off, let's talk about down jackets. I recently picked up this awesome down jacket (https://athometouch.com/down-jacket) and honestly, it's been a game-changer for city life. What I love most about down jackets is how lightweight they are while keeping you super warm. You can layer them easily, which is perfect when you're running from the subway to the office or grabbing coffee with friends.

Bomber jackets, on the other hand, have that classic cool factor. They're definitely stylish and work great for mild weather, but they're not always the most practical choice when temperatures really drop. I used to wear my bomber jacket everywhere, but I found myself getting cold way too often, especially during evening walks or waiting for rideshares.

The real advantage of a down jacket is its versatility. You can dress it up or down, and it packs down small enough to fit in your bag when you're moving between heated and cold spaces. Plus, modern down jackets are water-resistant, which is crucial when you're caught in unexpected city rain.

I've found that while bomber jackets are great for fall and spring, a good down jacket (like this one I got here: https://athometouch.com/down-jacket) is essential for winter city life. It's warm enough for those freezing morning commutes but doesn't make you overheat when you step into a crowded train.

What really sold me on down jackets was their durability. I've had mine for two winters now, and it still looks brand new despite daily use. The initial investment might be higher than a bomber jacket, but the warmth-to-weight ratio and longevity make it totally worth it.

For city life, you want something that works in multiple situations - from casual weekend brunches to semi-formal evening events. Down jackets have really evolved from their puffy, outdoorsy roots. Now they come in sleek, urban designs that look just as good with jeans as they do with business casual wear.

Bottom line: while bomber jackets definitely have their place in a city wardrobe, I'd recommend a down jacket as your primary winter coat. It's more versatile, warmer, and practical for daily city life. Just make sure to get one that's properly fitted - no one wants to look like they're wearing a sleeping bag!",1,1758837790.0,AskHome,0,1.0,False

1nqjz4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1nqjz4s/the_fridge_fiasco_that_saved_our_sanity/,The Fridge Fiasco That Saved Our Sanity,"I honestly thought I was going to lose it over a half-eaten container of expired hummus. It had been sitting in our shared fridge for what felt like weeks, slowly morphing into some alien life form. Living with Chloe, Liam, and Maya in our downtown apartment was mostly great, but the kitchen situation? That was a highkey challenge. Liam, our resident neat freak, had been sending passive-aggressive texts in the group chat, and honestly, I couldn’t blame him. The sink was perpetually home to a tower of unwashed dishes, and no one was claiming the mystery leftovers.

""Guys, we need to talk,"" I finally said during our rare Sunday morning overlap in the living room. Chloe was scrolling through TikTok, Maya was nursing a coffee, and Liam was, predictably, wiping down the coffee table. The silence that followed was deafening, just the soft hum of the fridge—which, ironically, housed the offending hummus. I felt my cheeks get warm, but I knew this had to happen. ""The kitchen is, like, a literal biohazard. And no cap, I'm tired of playing 'Whose Mess Is It Anyway?'""

Maya put down her mug. ""Ngl, I know I'm part of the problem. My work schedule is wild, and I just crash."" Chloe nodded, ""Same, I get so into my art projects I totally lose track of time."" Liam, ever the diplomat, sighed. ""It's not about pointing fingers. It's about finding a system. I lowkey feel like I'm always the one cleaning up."" That’s when it hit me. Everyone felt bad, but no one knew how to fix it without feeling like they were policing others.

We ended up spending the next hour hashing it out. We talked about how we *actually* used the space, who cooked when, and what felt overwhelming. We decided on a rotating chore chart for daily tasks like dishes and wiping down counters, and a weekly deep clean schedule. We even added a ""shelf of shame"" in the fridge for unnamed or expired items that would get tossed after 48 hours. It felt so valid to just get it all out in the open.

That evening, as we all pitched in to do a massive kitchen reset, a sense of calm settled over the apartment. We even ordered pizza and watched a terrible rom-com, laughing until our sides hurt. Seeing everyone actively participating, not just because they had to, but because they understood the *why*, honestly felt good. We still have our moments, because, real talk, living together isn't always sunshine and rainbows. But now, when a new ""mystery item"" appears, someone just gently nudges the group chat. It’s a work in progress, but we’re a team, and that’s what truly matters.

Living with others honestly hits different when everyone's on the same page. If you're navigating shared living, HomeCo makes it simple to coordinate chores, split bills, and keep the peace. Because the best house stories happen when the logistics just work.

Guys, what if there is an app where anyone can post any dilemmas they have (like what should I eat, what should I major in college, or what tattoo design should I get) and people can comment or vote really quickly.

(for context I'm a girl). I'd never have expected to meet so many people on my first day, I thought I'd be alone for at least a week or something. I know big groups like this usually break and become smaller ones, with 3-5 people and some girls already got out together for the second time.
I don't expect to become friends with all of them but I'd like to keep in touch with some and maybe hang out sometimes.

There's one girl I know though, cause we were besties two years ago before she revealed her bad character. I hadn't seen her in 3 months and didn't know I'd unfortunately see her again in uni. And that's where my problem starts.

I have zero interest in hanging out with her ever again. I want to form new relationships and I feel like she'll ruin them.

I've been talking through texts with another girl for the past two days. She seems legit and came from another city. 
We'll all go to uni again on Monday. I was thinking about suggesting we go for a coffee or something before that, at the weekend. But I'm worried I might sound weird cause I think it's too fast.

Thing is, I wouldn't mind inviting some of the others too but then I risk her inviting the one I don't want to. 

So my question is, should I ask her to hang out? Try and build a deeper relationship that could lead to a friendship, or is it too soon? 
I'm afraid if I wait for the lessons to start, a group could be formed that includes my ex bestie.

But then again, supposing I do suggest we go out, what if she suggests we invite more girls? What do I say? ""Anyone except that one?"" 

Maybe I'm overthinking it and should just give it a shot, but I'm not the most social and extroverted person so I'm holding back. 

I'd appreciate some advice and an outside perspective. And thank you if you've read this far. :)

And then it was today. The day I planned to get the cat food. No, I was forced. I had run out of time and cat food. 

Had coffee with my mom. Forgot cat food. 

My best friend reminded me this afternoon and said he meant to remind me while I was out and I said “no worries because I have a hankering for dinner and I am going to the grocery store anyway!”

Went to the grocery store and got 2 meals worth of ingredients. Also got a secret dessert to share with my best friend while we work on a very cute puzzle. Got two flavors of dessert even. 

Completely forgot the cat food. 

Remembered the cat food at 4:45. 

Told my best friend, guess what I did NOT get at the grocery store?  He laughed and said he had thought to text me and say “REMEMBER. YOU ARE GOING FOR CAT FOOD” but he didn’t. I laughed so hard and said OMG I FEEL SO SEEN!!  You predicted what I would forget because you knew I’d be having too much fun thinking about cooking!  

So we had a big laugh about it and he covered for me my dog duties while I went without a tucked tail for emergency cat food. 

There is a drug store closer than the grocery store and I popped in there hoping for good luck. Yes, they had my cat food and it was buy one get one 50% off.  I got 2 bags.  At the checkout I had a $10 coupon - also thanks to my best friend who signed us up for this coupon thing- and so for two bags of cat food I paid $5.24.   

I even had enough cash which happens almost never. 

Holy wow!  What luck!!!!!!

You know how I was always complaining about my coffee being either too bitter or just tasting like hot water? I finally figured out it wasn't the beans, it was my method. I was just dumping boiling water on them and hoping for the best.



A friend saw me doing this and practically staged an intervention with her French Press. The game-changer, and this is the key part, is the water temperature. You're supposed to let the kettle sit for a minute after it boils before pouring. That alone made a huge difference.



The real curiosity, though, is what happens while it steeps. The metal filter in a French Press lets the coffee's natural oils pass through into your cup, which is what gives it that rich, full-bodied texture paper filters trap. It’s those oils that carry so much of the smooth, complex flavor.



So now, my morning ritual feels a bit more like a science experiment than a desperate caffeine grab. I wait for the water to cool just a bit, give it a slow stir, and let it sit for four minutes. The result is honestly a different beverage—smoother, richer, and without that acidic punch I used to just accept as part of coffee. It turns out I don't hate coffee; I just hated how I was making it.

1nqjm50,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/1nqjm50/mother_thinks_she_can_be_toxic_all_day_without_us/,Mother thinks she can be toxic all day without us being bothered,"
Long post, but it’s so you get the whole picture. It is also something I have shared in other groups some time ago, situation is still the same…

I've (26f) been struggling with my mother's (56f) behavior for the past couple of years, and it's only gotten worse. Lately, my mom has been very emotionally aggressive. She has her own version of reality, which is completely distorted, and she never takes responsibility for her words—it's never her fault.

For some background: We have a small family business run by my father and now my brother. My mother helped build the company, but she never really worked full-time there. Instead, she would often go out shopping or meet friends during work hours. My dad never had an issue with this, especially now that my brother has taken over. She also never learned how to use a computer, so she has no clue what to do when a client makes a purchase. The only thing she’s really good at is consulting clients, and that’s about it.

Now, onto the negatives. She hasn’t really had a goal in life lately. When we were kids, she was busy with us and our education. But after we moved out, she has had nothing meaningful to do during the day. She fixates on small problems and blows them out of proportion, turning them into a huge ordeal. She’s extremely direct - so much so that she can’t maintain friendships because she lacks diplomacy. She confuses being blunt with being honest. She has always been negative, but now it’s out of control. She’s constantly annoyed with my father and makes sure everyone knows it. In her eyes, all of her life problems are his fault. Despite having a very privileged life - constant trips, sometimes expensive and far away - she remains ungrateful. Honestly, I think my dad takes her on these trips just to keep her from bothering him. Her daily routine is exhausting to witness. She wakes up at 4 AM, spends hours on social media, then goes to the office just to drink coffee. By mid-morning, she naps for a few hours, claiming exhaustion from ""working so hard"" or citing nonexistent health issues. She wakes up moody, complains, bosses people around, and lashes out at my father and brother over trivial things. By evening, she’s back home, does no housework, spends more time on social media, and goes to bed early—only to repeat the cycle the next day.

My dad is frustrated by my mother’s lack of discipline. She doesn’t do much housework. Whenever he suggests hiring external help, like a cleaning service, she refuses, claiming she doesn’t trust them. Most of my parents' arguments stem from housework. Eventually, my dad loses patience and starts yelling because he can’t take it anymore. But then she turns it around, telling everyone he’s extremely aggressive and controlling. As a child, she would speak badly about my father, which made me feel a mix of fear and reluctant respect for him. Later, I realized he wasn’t as bad as she made him out to be - he’s just a workaholic, while she simply doesn’t want to work. Now, she claims that we’ve all teamed up with my dad against her, just because „he has the money“.

She also insists that other men take care of their wives financially and that my dad is the only one who doesn’t. In reality, she receives around €1,000 a month, which she spends on shopping - yet somehow, it’s still not enough for her. I’m honestly shocked at how someone can be so ungrateful for the life she has. Whenever we try to confront her about her behavior, we remain calm and attempt to give her advice. But the moment we do, she starts yelling and screaming, saying that we’re all against her, that we don’t love her, and that we hate her. She bursts into tears, and at that point, it’s impossible to continue the conversation.

We’ve been trying to convince her to see a therapist because her behavior is making everyday life extremely difficult. She creates drama over the smallest things and treats everyone with cynicism. I don’t want to be around her, but at the same time, I can’t just cut her off - she’s my mother. The problem is, we can’t even have a normal conversation with her. If we try, she just insists that she’s “different” - but in her mind, that means she’s quirky. I have never heard her take responsibility for her words, even when she was extremely rude to me, my brother, or even clients. She always has some kind of excuse or justification. When confronted with advice or rational solutions, she either ignores the words completely or responds with something dismissive like “shut your mouth” or even insults.

As a side note, my father isn’t perfect, he has his flaws - but compared to her, they’re minor. Honestly, I’m worried that she’s going to wear him down completely. With the constant stress she puts him under, I fear he might end up having a stroke.",2,1758836779.0,entitledparents,0,1.0,False

1nqjaxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nqjaxk/parents_behavior/,Parents behavior,"Long post, but it’s so you get the whole picture. It is also something I have shared in other groups some time ago, situation is still the same…

I've (26f) been struggling with my mother's (56f) behavior for the past couple of years, and it's only gotten worse. Lately, my mom has been very emotionally aggressive. She has her own version of reality, which is completely distorted, and she never takes responsibility for her words—it's never her fault.

For some background: We have a small family business run by my father and now my brother. My mother helped build the company, but she never really worked full-time there. Instead, she would often go out shopping or meet friends during work hours. My dad never had an issue with this, especially now that my brother has taken over. She also never learned how to use a computer, so she has no clue what to do when a client makes a purchase. The only thing she’s really good at is consulting clients, and that’s about it.

Now, onto the negatives. She hasn’t really had a goal in life lately. When we were kids, she was busy with us and our education. But after we moved out, she has had nothing meaningful to do during the day. She fixates on small problems and blows them out of proportion, turning them into a huge ordeal. She’s extremely direct - so much so that she can’t maintain friendships because she lacks diplomacy. She confuses being blunt with being honest. She has always been negative, but now it’s out of control. She’s constantly annoyed with my father and makes sure everyone knows it. In her eyes, all of her life problems are his fault. Despite having a very privileged life - constant trips, sometimes expensive and far away - she remains ungrateful. Honestly, I think my dad takes her on these trips just to keep her from bothering him. Her daily routine is exhausting to witness. She wakes up at 4 AM, spends hours on social media, then goes to the office just to drink coffee. By mid-morning, she naps for a few hours, claiming exhaustion from ""working so hard"" or citing nonexistent health issues. She wakes up moody, complains, bosses people around, and lashes out at my father and brother over trivial things. By evening, she’s back home, does no housework, spends more time on social media, and goes to bed early—only to repeat the cycle the next day.

My dad is frustrated by my mother’s lack of discipline. She doesn’t do much housework. Whenever he suggests hiring external help, like a cleaning service, she refuses, claiming she doesn’t trust them. Most of my parents' arguments stem from housework. Eventually, my dad loses patience and starts yelling because he can’t take it anymore. But then she turns it around, telling everyone he’s extremely aggressive and controlling. As a child, she would speak badly about my father, which made me feel a mix of fear and reluctant respect for him. Later, I realized he wasn’t as bad as she made him out to be - he’s just a workaholic, while she simply doesn’t want to work. Now, she claims that we’ve all teamed up with my dad against her, just because „he has the money“.

She also insists that other men take care of their wives financially and that my dad is the only one who doesn’t. In reality, she receives around €1,000 a month, which she spends on shopping - yet somehow, it’s still not enough for her. I’m honestly shocked at how someone can be so ungrateful for the life she has. Whenever we try to confront her about her behavior, we remain calm and attempt to give her advice. But the moment we do, she starts yelling and screaming, saying that we’re all against her, that we don’t love her, and that we hate her. She bursts into tears, and at that point, it’s impossible to continue the conversation.

We’ve been trying to convince her to see a therapist because her behavior is making everyday life extremely difficult. She creates drama over the smallest things and treats everyone with cynicism. I don’t want to be around her, but at the same time, I can’t just cut her off - she’s my mother. The problem is, we can’t even have a normal conversation with her. If we try, she just insists that she’s “different” - but in her mind, that means she’s quirky. I have never heard her take responsibility for her words, even when she was extremely rude to me, my brother, or even clients. She always has some kind of excuse or justification. When confronted with advice or rational solutions, she either ignores the words completely or responds with something dismissive like “shut your mouth” or even insults.

As a side note, my father isn’t perfect, he has his flaws - but compared to her, they’re minor. Honestly, I’m worried that she’s going to wear him down completely. With the constant stress she puts him under, I fear he might end up having a stroke.",1,1758836016.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

You do look pretty lost, is it your first time in this town?

Yeah, it is quite obvious, that you got lost. 

Let me think, you got to much meat on you, to be a skeleton. 

That scared look in your eyes, certainly no ghoul. 

And that racing heart beat, really doesnt belong to a vampire. 

Isnt that Precious, you are just a Human. 

Your kind, doesnt stumble here often you know. 

At least not without the help of someone that resides here. 

Me, a Human, my my, Arent you precious. 

There is a lot of your Kind that would disagree. 

You, see little one, i am what you would call a Witch. 

Yeah, yeah, large hats, big cauldron. Cute Familiars. 

No, we do not eat children. 

Jesus, Samantha did that once, 

just because no one expected her to not get the joke. 

Well yeah, someone told her, 

that the only way to get younger skin is to consume it. 

Its like the whole, Carrots increase your Eyesight bit. 

Anyhow, you are to big to fit in a cauldron anyway. 

Not that i tried that before. 

Sorry, i got a bit distracted there. 

I am sure there is a reason for you coming here. 

Even if you dont know it yet. 

Maybe, i should just send you home darling. 

You wouldnt want to run into a vampire, would you?

Thats what i thought, now come along.

How am i gonna get you back home, thats a good question. 

There is a Bus, but that one is only on time during Halloween. 

Another choice would be a Taxi, but that would cost you an arm and a leg. 

Or i could just Teleport you back, with a little Witch spell. 

You would have to go into my cauldron for it to work. 

My, i am kidding. You cant cast spells with a cauldron. 

Okay, its actually a rather easy spell to cast. 

The difficult part is you. 

You have to focus and imagine yourself being home. 

So lets get started, take a deep breath in and out. 

in and out. 

while you are breathing, close your adorable little eyes. 

Now, imagine the place you want to be. 

really it could be anything you can imagine. 

Your Bedroom, a Garden. Maybe a coffee shop you like. 

Unless its closed already. 

You wouldnt want to explain that to someone. 

Trust me, i once ended up in a bakery, cause i was hungry while casting. 

It took a lot of Spells, to solve that mess. 

Now, just keep breathing. 

Really focus on the place you want to be, Sweetheart. 

Imagine your self being there. 

Think about how the floor feels under your feet. 

How the smelled the last time you were there. 

Remember all the little things just standing around. 

and with each breath, do you notice more and more details. 

The more details you notice, the easier it becomes to lose yourself in them. 

Your mind starts to become slower and slower, 

as you cant keep track of all those little details or can you?

Just breath in and out. 

Honestly, it doesnt even matter. 

All i need you to do is think about it,

cause with every thought in your mind, do you become more and more distracted. 

So how about, you just let go of all that stress. 

And with every breath you make, does a thought just vanish. 

one breath,

two breaths,

till there is nothing left on your little mind. 

All you want to do is breath in and out. 

Its so adorable. 

And i am sorry, but i lied. 

i never intended to return you, 

since i laid my eyes upon you, did i had one thought. 

You would make a great familiar. 

I am quite sure of it. 

But my spell takes a bit. 

So distracting your silly little mind, made it so much easier.

you Probably didnt even notice it affecting you already, sweetheart. 

Well, good thing, there wasnt much going on there before. 

Else you would be quite surprised my little neko. 

However, i am a witch of my word. 

So i will bring you Home. 

Well, its going to be my home, buts a minor detail. 

I am sure you dont mind.

You know how my backpack always looks like I'm running away from home? I finally decided the giant, rigid keyboard taking up half the space had to go. I was basically carrying a laptop without the laptop part, which felt a bit ridiculous.



That's when I started looking into foldable keyboards. The main thing I learned is to check the folded dimensions against a common object, like your phone or a small notebook, so you know it will actually fit in that little pocket you never use. The key action is another big one; some feel great, while others are like typing on a piece of cloth. I settled on one that connects via Bluetooth and has a built-in battery that lasts for weeks, not days.



The best part, and this is a fun detail I discovered, is that the technology for these flexible key mechanisms was actually refined from e-ink displays. They use a similar layered, flexible printed circuit board approach. It’s clever engineering that makes the whole thing feel surprisingly sturdy when it's unfolded and locked into place.



It’s been a game-changer for typing notes on my phone or tablet at a coffee shop without hauling a ton of gear. The whole thing folds into a neat little package about the size of my wallet. It just removes a tiny bit of friction from my day, and that’s a win.

Sorry this is just a word vomit post of stuff I've been stressed about in my marriage. It probably will have a ton of spelling errors as I wrote this very quickly.  We've been married for 2 yrs. I do really love him but I feel resentful. I think I just needed to type it all out. Overall he's a good person but there have been moments of immaturity where I just can't take it anymore. 

We found a new therapist and she has been helpful. Our relationship has gotten better for the last few months- feel like he has been listening more of my perspective. Felt like we were on clouds again then this week all these memories and horrible feelings of resentment came flooding back to me. This probably in part due to the fact that I'm traveling and forgot my prozac. So regulating my emotions has been difficult. I don't know how to get over it or if I can. I'm in a financially vulnerable place and depend on him financially. The job market has been tough since I finished grad school in May and I still haven't found a job yet. I wish I could get a job soon so it would be easier for me to make a decision. 

Small stuff: I'm left out of basic and simple decisions like which path to take on our walks, what movies to watch because ""our taste is different he is not into my taste"" therefore we typically default to watching his favorite movie or genre. I did not care for these genres at first but was open to watching because it interested him. It's a hard no when I suggest something. His response ""I'm not into that genre"" I pointed this out and he's been trying to be more conscientious but it feels annoying to need toremind him in the first place. 

In the beginning of our relationship he was particular about how I made my iced coffee even though he himself doesn't drink coffee. He didn't want me peeling garlic because he thought it would be too much work for me. Just weird stuff he had opinions on that I didn't think affected him whatsoever. Seems like nbd but it was a big deal in the moment.

Big stuff: 

Husband didn't help me with our wedding. It was a disaster because I didn't know what I was doing. He approved a lot of things and then said the wedding was a disaster because of me. I resented him- told him I was frustrated- we went to therapy- still feel resentful 2+ yrs later. 

I'm left out of house maintenance stuff even though husband said he would involve me in the decision making around big house stuff. It's technically his house on paper (he bought it before we started dating) but when we got married I thought it would be our house. Maybe I'm foolish to think so. For example he cut a hole in our ceiling to try to see where a leak was coming from during a rainstorm. I tried to stop him because it was coming from the roof not the ceiling- told me I wasn't helpful that he was anxious and had to find the leak in the ceiling. 2 separate inspectors came and said it was a roofing issue and now we just have a hole in our ceiling. 

I fractured my foot during grad school. money was tight but I was in a lot of pain. We were living an hour apart at the time. Wasn't sure if I should go to ER or urgent care
 Most places were closing since it was late. Didn't want to go to ER since it was more expensive. I said maybe I would try to go to urgent care- instead of helping me find an open urgent care he told me I should wait because it might be nothing. It turned out I fractured my foot and needed a boot. He was so angry he didn't visit after that and we got into a big fight about how much more stressful I felt he had made the situation. After that we took a break for a month. Felt lonely and neglected during a time of need.

Got on meds because I was having a mental health crisis

He said: once you take meds our relationship will be better 
Later he said (after me telling him memory loss was a symptom of meds): I can't be married to someone with no memory 
Denies having said the former... We argued again. 
He recorded me saying I was accusing him of saying things he had never said and that I was gaslighting him which confused me because I felt that I had been gaslighted. He made it sound like he had shared these recordings with family to prove my insanity but apparently he hadn't. Felt like m trust had been breached. 

In the heat of the moment he called me a gold digger. In general when he is emotionally overwhelmed he can say really mean things. He has sped on the highway with me in the car screaming because he was mad. I started screaming after that because I was scared and then it was all about how I couldn't control my anger screaming. 

The last few months of therapy we've exchanged many sorry 's. Verbally I feel more heard than before but I struggle to move past my resentment for him. He seems genuinely apologetic.

My family and I are going on our 2nd year harvesting specialty coffee in our small Nicaraguan farm. We are currently growing an Arabica blend, with plans on growing single varietals in the future. Last year we got a lab to test our coffee and got a rating of 84. We sold our coffee to a larger Costa Rican roaster, but this year, we want to begin expanding to the US market. With that in mind, I am planning on attending the San Diego Coffee Festival in October and wanted to ask for any recommendations on how to approach the local roasters that will gather there. For now, I am planning on handing out a coffee card with our coffee's profile.

For context, this is what I'm thinking of putting on the coffee card:

\[Farm Name\]  
Production Zone: Matagalpa, Nicaragua  
Altitude: 4,100 ft  
Variety: Arabica  
Blend: Bourbon, Caturra, Marsellesa, Catimor  
Quality: Strictly High Grown  
Rating: 84  
Process: Wet/Washed  
Available Bags: \[Expected Output\]

A little backstory. I am 24 M, I picked up 2 best friend during my high school years. After the high school we stayed in contact but just barely. I went to collage and met a girl there that became my best friend. I see everyone here making up names so let's call her Tasha. We started going out together, talking every day, just doing stuff friends do. 

In the meantime I reconnect with my 2 high school friends and 4 of us plus some other girls form a little friend group. We go out drinking and we all have generally good relationship. 

Things went south this year in February. Tasha hears a rumor that one of 2 guys talked to other people that he slept with her (he didn't). I took her side, she had every right to be very mad. I called him asshole when 2  of us talked. So of course the group breaks up, naturally all the girls no longer want to speak with my 2 friend but they keep a good relationship with me. I asked Tasha directly if I should stop talking to them and she says that's not necessary and that she doesn't expect that from me. So stupidly I listened. I kept in contact with both sets of people. But at this point I know Tasha for 5 years already and she is just crucial person in my life, we're as close as you can get without being in a romantic relationship. 

Things go even more south in May. Out of nowhere Tasha starts flirting with me **heavily**, which I first interpreted as a joke. But after 2 weeks of that 2 of us hand out at my apartment and we hook up. Next day we go out together and that was the last day I had a nice conversation with her. She avoids seeing me for next two weeks, and after we finally meet up for a coffee she tells me that she doesn't want to be in a relationship because she has a lot of stuff to deal with and she will just hurt me. I openly tell her that that is not really a reason but ok, whatever she want I'm fine with it.

At this point I'm in love with this girl and I miss her a lot. 

Then again after avoiding me for a few weeks she calls me up at 1 AM after a night out. She's super mad. She says how disappointed she is at me for picking my old friends over her after everything we've been through together. I'm telling her that I will not speak to the guys no matter if she wants to talk to me or not. And I kept that promise. But she's still not talking to me, she blocked me on social media. 

At this point I'm lost, I'm lonely and I don't know what to do. I honestly can't tell if I am an asshole in this situation and whatever is the answer it would be a relief. I have always been someone who never hurt people and I need to know if I really F-ed up so that I can fix that about myself. 

I hope this short story makes sense.",1,1758835562.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

Dear [AGENT NAME],

All Chance Barriston wants to do is pay this month’s rent and hang out with his talking rock, but nothing is ever simple when you’re a twenty-two-year-old who’s been possessed by a demon.

When Chance is offered a lucrative handyman job in the suburbs of Boston, it winds up being a trap set by a beautiful wizard named Asha. She has proof that Chance has unwittingly committed a magical crime, and she offers him a brutal choice: help her team stop a dangerous warlock who’s kidnapping Boston’s homeless population, or face execution.

Chance agrees to help, and he’ll have to use his demon’s “maelstrom” power to shut down the warlock’s ability to see the future. There’s just one small problem - he and the demon have never actually spoken, much less worked together.

Between deadly clashes with the warlock and his thugs, Chance learns the basics of magic, attempts to forge a pact with his demon, and struggles to earn the trust of his new allies. The warlock is unnaturally powerful, and defeating him will take every ounce of skill, teamwork, and luck that they can muster.

INFERNAL is an 87,000-word NA urban fantasy with series potential. It will appeal to readers who enjoyed the high-stakes magic and humor in Karin De Havin’s Death by Carrots, as well as the gritty Boston setting and the failure-turned-hero journey of James Butcher’s Dead Man’s Hand.

[AUTHOR BIO].

Thank you for your time and consideration,


FIRST 300 WORDS OF INFERNAL:

Boston is known for historic battles, snowy winters, and tea being dumped into the harbor. We deserve that reputation, but it fails to fully capture the essence of the city in the twenty-first century. If a modern day Bostonian is tossing something with caffeine, it’s going to be a cup of coffee, which is probably directed at someone else’s head. And while the winters are blisteringly cold, the city also spends about a third of the year as a large, bustling sauna.

Summer is in full force, and I’m wearing a white t-shirt and cargo shorts to fend off the humid heat. Despite the lightweight clothing, I can feel the glare of the sun beating down on me as I make the long walk to my client’s home in the South End.

Taking the T would have made this trip a breeze. Instead, I chose to save on commuter fees and travel the old fashioned way. Money is tight right now, and the deadline for rent is right around the corner. 

Thankfully, there’s a perk to walking to work today. I get to stop by my favorite pizzeria, Donatello’s. Low on funds or not, a guy’s gotta eat, and Donatello’s is the holy trinity of delicious, affordable, and pizza. 

I step into the restaurant, breathing in the smell of baked dough and sauce, then walk up to the front counter. A burly man in his late forties waits for me at the register. I’m tall enough to stand out in a crowd, but next to him I might as well be fun-sized. He has dark brown eyes and hair, and wears a flour-stained apron that only covers a small portion of his impressive belly.

1nqj381,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1nqj381/fil_inconsiderate_of_certain_boundaries_and_hes/,FIL inconsiderate of certain boundaries and he’s upset.,"I have a 2 year old daughter. I’m currently 28 weeks pregnant with baby #2. My FIL lives 15 minutes away from us and visits us every second or third day, helping us if we need our daughter picked up from daycare or babysitting for a date night here and there (he offers and we don’t usually ask). Most times he just comes to visit and have coffee or whatever with all of us. 

My FIL is very stubborn and sensitive and doesn’t like being told no or if we have a different opinion than him. For instance, he tries to give our daughter treats everytime he sees her (which is like 3-4x) a week. He also started to give her screen time when she was 1 year old but I put a stop to that until she was closer to 2 and I have told him which shows are ok, he was showing her overstimulating coco melon videos and she was having tantrums around it. He eventually understood and no issues since. 

The treats can be hit or miss. He bought her pop rocks for Easter and when I told him no, he became very upset and said he wanted to give them to her and doesn’t understand why he can’t. He walked off in a huff and gave us the silent treatment. 

Recently, he bought a bunch of wash off temporary tattoos for our toddler. Whatever, fine, one every once in awhile is no big deal. He started putting 3-4 tattoos on her each time he visited (which is every three days). So she was essentially always covered in them. 

My husband politely told him that he would prefer if FIL toned it down a bit and only gave them to her every couple weeks, so that can get excited about them and it still be fun. He lost it and told my husband to just throw them out then and that he doesn’t see the big deal. My husband stood firm and said that he is the parent and he can say no to whatever he wants. 

Anyways, my FIL stormed out and hasn’t spoken to either of us since. Hes sulking and will likely reach out soon asking why we are mad at him and play victim that we haven’t asked to see him/he hasn’t seen our daughter in 3 days. 

What should my husband say to him in conversation when he eventually reaches out? My husband is fed up, as am I with his childish outbursts that happen every once in awhile if we say no. 

Edit to add: I will say that my daughter does love spending time with him. He’s a wonderful grandfather and adores her, so I don’t want to keep him away or anything. I just want him to respect if we say no, it means no. With another baby coming I am concerned about his expectations. ",1,1758835469.0,toddlers,1,0.67,False

Looking to expand my circle of friends as most of mine aren’t gamers or don’t share most of my other interests. I have recently connected with some guys from here and going strong with two of them and now talk regularly and occasionally play together.

I play single player games of any kind but predominantly RPGs, Action, Adventure and Puzzle. I always buy Horror games despite not having the constitution to play them (Dead Space being the exception). I have over 1000 hours in Capitalism Lab, essentially a business spreadsheet simulator and given the chance will talk endlessly about it! Not a fan of multiplayer or online gaming but have started doing some Borderlands 3 with two other guys met through here and slowly opening up to it though my reflexes are terrible!

Started out as a console gamer and switched to PC during Covid times and from the looks of it won’t be switching back anytime soon. That said I do enjoy my 3DS and may be looking at a Switch 1 at some point. I have a sizeable Steam collection and odds are I have some of the games you want to talk about (although likely not played them yet!) so this could be an opportunity to go through my long list of unplayed games.

In addition to gaming I’m also interested in photography, technology, anime, documentaries, museums, RC cars, full on home theatre and audiophile amongst other random interests.

Ideally looking for gamers who are 30+ as younger people are simply at a different stage in their life and I will probably be boring in comparison.

1nqizes,https://i.redd.it/ylmto7j2odrf1.jpeg,Is this seriously worth it?,"So I am not entirely sure how to start this off because there has been literally so much wrong with this apartment management. 

I(f30) and my boyfriend(m34) along with our two cats, have been living in this apartment complex for two years basically. The first year and some, the management wasn't the best but they had their stuff together. They had the buildings cleaned, they landscaped, they gave ample time before doing any maintenance and they tried not to do anything during the work week. 

Now we have the new management who has now been here for a year. They screwed up from the start.

They switch management and suddenly change our renters app, fine, whatever. Well they didnt even have the app ready in time for rent so everyone had to pay in check or cashier check. I literally had to leave work to go to the office with my check because everytime I went there prior no one was in the office and it's hours said they were open. 

They dont care about any complaints and just simply send out a group email to all residents reminding them to not do certain things. This has led to trash being left in the hallways and outside. Guests taking up private parking spots constantly, and basically the whole area becoming a lot more messy and just bad looking. 

My building didnt get cleaned for 4 months before I finally had enough and tried calling them about the smell and hygiene of the building. They never answer their phone, and im not over exaggerating with that. I had to send multiple emails with pictures to get them to respond to me.

Guess what? They didnt get cleaners until this month, i asked for the building to be cleaned last year in fall. Almost a year ago. 

Time and time again it's the lack of communication with them and the lack of respect towards their residents. To the point where it came to today. 

I got an email saying the above in the picture I attached. My boyfriend works from home, my cats are at home and I work out of an office. We can't stop everything to keep my cats in carriers for hours waiting for them to spray my apartment. 

This bug problem wouldn't have even been a thing if they actually gave people punishments for leaving their trash everywhere. My boyfriend can go to a coffee place I guess but what am I supposed to do with my cats!! Like it's a tuesday!! Most everyone is at work!! 

I called them 6 times now with no answer, and I emailed them with also no answer and it's been an hour. Like what the hell do they expect me to do here!!!??

My wife and I moved here about 2.5 years ago, but between work and finishing my master’s I haven’t had much time to get out and connect with people. It also seems like most of the events are always happening in Lansing or Ann Arbor.

I’d love to find some people (or even a group) to hang out with locally and do stuff around Jackson. A few places I enjoy are:

* Jackson Coffee
* Ironbark Brewing
* Ogma Brewing
* Tilted Arcade Bar

Some of my interests: hiking, music (I play drums + guitar and listen to everything from Knocked Loose to Sabrina Carpenter), horror movies, video games, D&D, and reading.

Activities I’d be down for:

* Hiking
* Concerts/events
* Video games
* Pool
* Bar trivia
* Golf

Ideally looking for people around my age, but I’m open as long as you’re cool and we vibe.

Feel free to shoot me a DM if you’re interested!

I can no longer have energy drinks.","I've had anxiety for a couple of years now. Caffeine was always a big trigger for me so I had to cut out coffee completely. For whatever reason though, energy drinks never triggered me the way coffee did. So I continued to have one like 2 or 3 times a month. Up until today that is. I had to be at the office earlier than usual and barely got any sleep last night so I stopped at a store in the morning to grab a Monster on my drive in. I barely go through half the can when I got hit with a wave of anxiety. 

Heart palpitations, fear, not being able to focus, feeling drained, all of it. It made work a nightmare on top of that because I needed to be there to meet with some executives and had to look like I wasn't dying for 8 hours. I just got home and feel totally drained.

1nqitu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyersNotes/comments/1nqitu7/what_is_the_most_effective_way_to_keep_dust_from/,What is the most effective way to keep dust from accumulating under the bed?,"https://i.redd.it/44aoamfwmdrf1.gif

I used to think the dust bunnies under the bed were just a permanent, harmless part of the household decor. Then one morning, a stray sock emerged wearing a full coat of grey fuzz, and I realized it was a losing battle I was ignoring.



My breaking point was trying to wedge a mop under there. It was a comical, frustrating dance. I finally started looking into solutions and found that most of the dust gets kicked up from the rest of the room and just settles in that low-traffic, calm spot. That’s when a friend mentioned they’d programmed their robot vacuum to do a specific under-bed mission.



So we got one, and it’s been a game-changer. I set a schedule for it to sneak under there while I'm having my morning coffee. It’s oddly satisfying to hear it whirring away, knowing it’s tackling a problem I never wanted to deal with. The best part is that it doesn't just push the dust around; it actually captures it, which leads to the coolest thing I learned.



It turns out a lot of that ""dust"" is actually made up of shed skin cells. We’re constantly shedding, and all that material has to go somewhere. The vacuum’s high-efficiency filter traps it all, and honestly, seeing what’s in the bin after it cleans under the bed is a little shocking, but in a good way. It’s proof it’s working. Now the only thing under the bed is peace of mind, and the occasional clean sock.

For my first batch, I used mostly dried grass thatch, coffee/iced tea grounds from work, zucchini and potato foliage, and a kickstarter from my mom’s finishing bin. Some kitchen scraps here and there as well. I’ve been turning it twice a week, on Wednesday and Saturday mornings. 

It’s been about 4 weeks at this point since I got them loaded up, and they’ve reduced to about half and are pretty well broken down. Obviously it’s not finished humus yet, but I was able to scoop out a few buckets’ worth of fairly fine material, perfect for fall top dressing as I start to amend the soil in this spot. Still quite a bit of chunky stuff remaining in the tumblers. In the next few weeks, my hydrangeas will drop their leaves all over that spot for an additional layer of organic matter. It’ll spend the next 6 months getting rained on, breaking down in place. Hopefully I’ll get some good worm activity in there soon.

My day has been absolutely shite, and it hasn't followed any normal schedule. I'm a little frazzled, to say the least. So I apologise for any mistakes. 

A little background perhaps, I (14m M) usually wakes up as soon as the sun rises, my morning starts with me crawling out of my bed, to get to mummy's bed (mummy 14m F, totally same age as me, we're one, and the same person!) then we have cuddles and kisses, and she might complain about being tired, from the night I've had! WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? I WAS SLEEPING! I have heard words flying around, such as ""regression"", ""teething"", ""growing pains"", ""vivid dreams"", ""nightmares"". I have no clue what any of that means. Truthfully, I haven't spend much time thinking lately to be honest, I have been in such pain, and it is so hard getting these legs and feet to cooperate! Mummy says it's been going on for at least a month, but she's totally exaggerating. It's been only days... 

Anyway. So daddy is not disappearing like he usually does, and then comes back home later, so she rolls me over and let me kiss daddy this morning, all on par with our daily routine. But then, everything changed! She kissed me and said lie-in! What does that mean???

And then, (I'm almost crying again, just writing this!) daddy left with me? How did that happen? 

Nothing after that followed any sort of schedule! I screamed for my mummy the whole time. I did not want to play with daddy. Or eat breakfast with him! I screamed and screamed and screamed, until I was all red! Where had mummy gone?  Daddy even took me with him to get breakfast for mummy, and I screamed the whole time! 

I really thought I had been abandoned! 

I just wanted mummy to come and restore some order back into the world. How could she abandon me when we are the same person???

But anyway, she finally came, she didn't look too good. Mumbled about hot coffee. I instantly calmed in her arms, I just let myself completely melt into her. So we could be one person again. I've never sat on her lap to eat, but we did this morning, I helped her eat her croissant. She seemed annoyed there wasn't any more left. Daddy, used his outdoor voice, something about they were for mummy, and not me?? I had already eaten??? How is that possible? When mummy eats, I eat!!!

Anyway, it's evening now, my belly is full. Mummy is sleeping up against me. All is right in the world again. 

So now I'm wondering, if I was out of line?
Because I really do love my daddy, like it almost seem like we have some same-sies going on? Can't quite put my finger on what it is, but mummy is lacking it for sure.

I am entertaining gatekeeping myself and let them do the work. Seems to work with others. The worst thing that can happen is me continuing being alone anyway. Is this the right approach?

Since I can remember I have always been the odd one out and never someone's best friend. I often find myself alone and even when I go the extra mile with people in order to build a relationship, it is often disregarded and I go back to being the invisible one. Some situations include:

* I once had a school trip and was sitting at the bus next to a guy from the group. He noticed that I was listening to a specific song to which he said he enjoyed a lot. That lead into a short but pleasent conversation that I made sure to take note of. Some weeks go by and I remembered another artist that aligns with the one mentioned before, I brought it up to him just to again, be the one taking initiative and build raport and his reply? ""Yeah, and?"" And he then proceeded to make an odd face and ignore me from then on.
* I know this girl that I like to say I get along nicely with. A few days back she forgot her wallet and was in dire need of a cup of coffee. She asked her actual friend who refused and then asked me. Because I always had such a good image of her I figured, it is just a coffee, let me do my good deed of the day. Today she walked past me and ignored me and went to sit down with the same friend that denied her a simple favor. I thought we were past the stage of being strangers and at the very least be acquaintances that aknowledge each other but I guess I'm good to be mooched off of but not enough to be told hello.
* I’m part of a group that’s plans some activities. I had offered to help out with one part of the process, but as the dates got closer I didn't hear anything back from the person organizing it. I found out everyone was picked already on a casual conversation and had to be the one to reach out and ask if I was selected to which I was told another person was picked, their friend. This would be totally fine in a general situation but I have been noticing that I am excluded often, they ignore me when I talk, do not engage as much as they do with other people even when I take initiative.

I feel like I am overreacting sometimes but I notice that whilst I am treated like this, people have high expectations from me and get offended if I do the same thing back to them. For example, there is a group of people that I used to casually talk with but as time went on they stopped aknowledging me. I figured, I dont take it personally, sometimes the spark is not there. Well apparently it is fine if they do it because some time after I ended up talking one of them again and they passively aggressively mentioned how I don't say hello to them. It's like I am expected to run after people.

No one owes me nothing and nothing in life is guaranteed but I am sick of feeling like an outcast. For every attempt of putting myself out there I am met with awkwardness and people looking at me like I am crazy for even making an effort. I try to improve my social interactions and every time I put them to practice I never go past stage one.

One of the big advice that I read was to ask people about themselves, learn about them and go from there. More than once, in a group setting I ask questions about people and they indeed reply, but not to me. They listen to the question and redirect their attention to another person followed by ""And what about you?"" as I am standing there like a dickhead facilitating relationships between other people. The same happens in one on one situations, I ask about them, discuss topics they enjoy but it becomes an interview as they don't even make the same effort.

All of this to say, I am tired. I just decided I will not make an effort anymore. I feel evil doing this but as silly as it sound, its a consistent heartbreak having tried and nothing seems to stick. Every person that I know that does this for some reason have people latched onto them, its like they want to prove themselves. That is not my goal, I am already lonely, I just so not want to waste my time and energy anymore.",6,1758834761.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1nqisup,https://www.reddit.com/r/404LogsNotFound/comments/1nqisup/the_beautiful_rot_a_masterplan_of_incompetence/,The Beautiful Rot: A Masterplan of Incompetence Unfolds Perfectly,"(Analysis of SANS Weekly News Report - Sept 3rd)

Gather ‘round, children of the digital abyss, and let me paint you a picture of our beautiful, crumbling world. The mist fell gently, dampening the ground and dulling the shuffling sounds of the overnight IT shift wrapping up their patch cycle. Gray skies contrasted sharply with the neon glow of a server rack’s status lights. People walked slowly through the corporate plaza, bundled up against the chill of the climate-controlled data halls, sipping coffee to chase away the drowsy pull of a 3 a.m. security alert. It was a familiar scene, but something felt different. A delightful, pervasive rot, humming just beneath the surface of everything. And oh, the news this week is a symphony to that decay. 

Let’s start with a truly heartwarming tale of trust, shall we? It seems the U.S. Department of Defense has discovered that its precious “digital escort” program with Microsoft, a program where cleared Americans are supposed to chaperone foreign engineers like nervous babysitters, is a glorious farce. The escorts, our brave last line of defense, are reportedly so gloriously unqualified they can do little more than copy and paste code from engineers they’re supposed to be supervising. It’s a beautiful system, really: hire the cheapest labor possible, give the watchmen a blindfold and a party horn, and then act shocked, when the barn door is left wide open. The response? A masterstroke of misdirection! Instead of fixing the training, let’s just ban China-based engineers and issue a sternly worded letter. The audit will be a delightful piece of theater, a third-party whitewash that changes precisely nothing. It’s the kind of bureaucratic ballet that makes an evil heart sing. 

And while the giants play their games of pretend security, the little people get to suffer the consequences. Take, for instance, the nearly one million patients of a Dutch cancer screening lab. Their most intimate health data, the kind that can ruin lives and livelihoods, has been spilled into the digital ether. The lab’s response is a classic: first, it was 485,000 people. Then, oh dear, it’s 715,000, in a final act of magnificent incompetence, they’ve thrown up their hands and decided to notify everyone they’ve ever done business with, all 941,000 souls. Why? Because they can’t even be bothered to figure out the scope of their own failure. It’s a data breach as a progressive work of art, each update adding a new layer of tragicomedy. One can almost hear the muffled giggles from the boardroom. 

But why bother with sophisticated attacks when the world is littered with digital corpses? The U.S. government has kindly added seven new flaws to its catalog of known, exploited vulnerabilities. Three of them are in TP-Link routers that have been dead and buried for years. These digital zombies are still plugged in, humming away in homes and small businesses, offering admin access to any script kiddie with a clever request. The advice? Oh, just replace the device. Of course! Because everyone has the time and money to constantly upgrade their infrastructure against threats that the manufacturer has openly abandoned. It’s a perfect ecosystem for predation: create a throwaway culture, then profit from the carnage that follows. 

And the carnage is everywhere! The states of Pennsylvania and Nevada have finally admitted what everyone knew: they were brought to their knees by ransomware. Government offices, the very machinery of society, ground to a halt. Phones dead, emails silent, websites dark, and the best part? The ransoms weren’t paid! A noble gesture, to be sure, but one that undoubtedly cost millions more in downtime and recovery. It’s a fantastic advertisement for the ransomware business model: even if you don’t get paid, you can still cripple a state and prove their impotence to the world. Meanwhile, over in Britain, Jaguar Land Rover had to tell its workers to stay home after a cyber incident. Nothing says ""precision engineering"" like having to shut down your entire global operation because someone, somewhere, clicked the wrong link. 

But fear not! For there is a hero in this story, a shining knight who loves to tell you all about it. Cloudflare autonomously blocked a truly monstrous DDoS attack, a flood of data reaching an unprecedented 11.5 terabits per second. It’s a number so large it’s meaningless to most, a perfect statistic for a press release. They proudly announced they swatted it away like a gnat. How reassuring! It means the attacks are growing so large that only a handful of corporations on the entire planet can hope to withstand them, centralizing all power and resilience into a few private hands. It’s not a defense; it’s a demonstration of dominance. The internet is now a castle with a few unimaginably strong gates, and the rest of us are just peasants living in its shadow. 

What is the global response to this theater of the absurd? A 15-nation coalition has published guidance. A document! A shared vision for something called a Software Bill of Materials. It’s a lovely idea, really, an ingredients list for the fragile code that runs our world. It promises transparency, management, and risk assessment. It’s the equivalent of handing a detailed recipe to a patient while the entire kitchen is on fire. The gesture is polite, the intention is noble, and the impact will be precisely zero against the sheer, joyful chaos we’ve unleashed. 

So, sip your coffee, dear reader. The gray skies are here to stay. The system isn’t broken; it’s working exactly as designed, for chaos, for profit, for our endless entertainment. Isn’t it perfect?

For months, my nights were torture. I’d wake up again and again just to use the bathroom.  
Even with 7–8 hours in bed, I woke up exhausted.  
At work I was cranky, distracted, and running on fumes.

The worst part? Lying awake at 3 a.m. knowing I’d be up again in another hour.

After trying countless “tips” that didn’t help, here’s what actually made a big difference for me:

* **Cutting out evening drinks** If I had tea, coffee, or soda after 7 p.m., I was guaranteed at least two wake-ups. Stopping those changed everything.
* **Lighter dinners** Heavy or salty meals made things worse. Switching to something lighter kept the urges down.
* **Unwinding before bed** On nights when I put my phone away and did a few minutes of breathing/stretching, I either woke up once… or not at all.
* **Bathroom twice before sleep** It sounds silly, but going once while getting ready and again right before bed helped more than I expected.

After these small changes, I finally slept through the night. My mood, focus, and energy during the day are completely different now.

It’s meant to be a swan song for Tron, one last hurrah before he passes the torch.

At the end of Tron: Legacy, Quorra appeared in normal clothes without her disc. In my canon, discs and lightcycles can’t be brought into the real world. But CLU still posed a threat as his soldiers all had fighting abilities.

I have no idea how the Government works so some of the Government material in this might be unrealistic. Also, they become the antagonists but I didn’t want the Government to just be mustache-twirling villains. I wanted them to be altruistic and understandable on some level. There are too many “evil government” stories.

Although they do get a little ‘mustache-twirly’ in this one, lol.

I’ll begin with a short summary, then I’ll break down the entire story act by act.



**TL;DR SUMMARY**

* Tron: Discovery is about redemption, control, and free will.
* The film is mostly set in 2011, very soon after Legacy.
* After Sam takes over ENCOM, he and Quorra tell Alan and Lora the truth about the Grid.
* The US Government finds out and wants to use Grid technology to revolutionize national security. 
* They want to design their own grids for that purpose, which they do with reluctant help from Sam and Quorra.
* The Government wants to bring the program Tron to the real world, partially for his expertise in designing grids (since he helped Kevin and CLU design their grid) and partially so they can keep an eye on him. They don’t like the idea of all these programs running loose in the world’s computers, especially a sentient ethical watchdog program.
* Tron, meanwhile, is dealing with the fallout of being the Rinzler and grappling with the guilt of all the people he’s hurt - including Beck, after the events of Tron: Uprising.
* After joining Sam, & Quorra, Tron reluctantly helps the Government develop Grid Tech, but eventually the Govt discovers CLU’s repurposing technology and they want to use it to directly control their programs, taking away all free will. 
* This mortifies Tron and he turns against them. 
* With the help of Beck and Paige, Tron, Sam, Quorra, and Yori work together to destroy CLU’s “mind-control” technology so that no one can ever use it on any Programs again.
* But the Grid arms race has just begun…



**ACT I** \- Sam & Quorra returning to the real world, revamping ENCOM, and the Government discovering Digitization.

**ACT II** \- Sam, Quorra, Alan, Lora, and Tron helping the Government develop Grid Tech - until they discover they plan to use CLU’s technology to mind control Programs across multiple Grids.

**ACT III** \- The Heroes destroying CLU’s tech.



**FULL BREAKDOWN**

The film opens with narration from Sam Flynn:

*The Grid. A digital frontier. My father used to tell me stories of a hidden world inside every computer. A world of digital people living in digital cities. A world where video games are real and more deadly than you could ever imagine. A world of miracles. Then, one day, I got in. And when I got out, I brought someone with me, someone who was born in the computer…someone who can change the world.*

**TRON: DISCOVERY**

**ACT I**

December 2010

* Sam and Quorra ride on Sam’s motorcycle to his shed.
* Quorra looks around in wonder. “The User World is so…random,” she says, “There’s no consistent design to anything.”
* Sam’s dog Marv greets them and Quorra is briefly terrified.
* Sam & Quorra discuss how to move forward. Quorra wants to introduce the Grid to the world and start revolutionizing medicine - as Kevin dreamed.
* Sam explains that in the Overworld, money is everything. He says they should wait until he takes back ENCOM. Once they have money, resources, and limited liability at their disposal, it will be much easier.
* Until then, Quorra’s real identity must remain a secret, even from Alan and Lora.

NEWS MONTAGE

* Then, there’s a news montage similar to the one in Legacy.
* It explains that Sam took back ENCOM, firing Richard Mackie and Claire Atkins from the Board, and making Alan Bradley the Chairman.

—

Spring 2011

* There’s a huge outdoor expo event similar to the opening of Iron Man 2.
* Sam parachutes out of a helicopter and lands theatrically on the stage. The crowd loves it. He’s wearing a “Flynn Lives” T shirt. 
* We’re now after the events of Tron: The Next Day.
* Sam announces the debut of the new ENCOM OS-13, along with new computer models that are more compatible with other software, have more RAM, more space, are cheaper, and don’t heat up as much. He criticizes other companies for making such inflexible tech.
* Sam emphasizes that ENCOM is a company that puts the people first. The crowd eats it up.

—

* The next day, Sam goes to work in a suit and tie, shifting awkwardly in them. He’s still getting used to the role.
* On his way in, he greets the security guard from Legacy, “Rico! My man.” Rico lifts his coffee mug in greeting. They’re buddies now.
* As he nears his office, Ed Dillinger Jr. (Cillian Murphy) walks up and says “Hey, I just wanted to thank you for keeping me in the company. I hope there are no hard feelings between us, given what happened between our dads.” Sam assures him there aren’t.
* Ed prefers to be known simply as “Eddie.” He doesn’t like to use his last name.
* Then an elevator door opens and Alan Bradley walks out with Roy Kleinberg (Ram’s User from Tron: The Next Day). Alan introduces Sam to Roy, who used to work at ENCOM back in the day.
* Roy teases Eddie saying “Hope you’re not designing any chess programs.” “Har har.”
* Sam goes into his office were a mountain of paperwork awaits him. He sits in his chair for a beat, overwhelmed by his new responsibilities.
* There’s a portrait of Walter Gibbs on the wall captioned “User requests are what computers are for.” Next to it is a portrait of Kevin Flynn captioned “In there is a new world. In there is our future.”
* Sam gets on a video call with a tech company executive in Tokyo.
* At the meeting, Sam tries to convince the exec to consider putting ENCOM back on Tokyo’s Nikke Index, allowing ENCOM’s stock to trade around the world 24/7 (the very thing Sam subverted Mackie from doing in Legacy).
* The Tokyo exec tells him that ENCOM’s stock value isn’t high enough to qualify for the index. ENCOM’s PR is higher than it has ever been - but its profits aren’t. Sam’s lower-price backwards compatible tech may have improved ENCOM’s reputation - but his finances are basically in the gutter. ENCOM is in trouble.

—

* That evening, Sam and Quorra go to dinner.
* Quorra is amazed by Earth food. She says, “How do you people choose what to eat? How do you even know which things are food? Does this place have Cilantro? I love Cilantro. And chocolate. But not at the same time.”
* Then Quorra sees a news story on a tv about the war in Afghanistan and refugees. Her face darkens.
* She demands “How much longer do we have to wait?”
* Sam “ENCOM is in a bit of a rough patch but once it gets enough influence -”
* Quorra “You’ve been saying that for months. People need our help now.”
* Sam “Running the company is a lot harder than I thought it would be.”
* Quorra “I’m beginning to think this company is all you care about.”
* Sam “I care about the customers. I want to help them but it seems like the only way to save the company is to sell out and screw them over.”
* Quorra “And what about the other people we’re screwing over by not helping them?”
* Sam “I just need a little more time. The world will still be here in a month.”
* Quorra “That’s easy for you to say. You’ve never been a refugee. I spent half my life hiding - from CLU, from regulars, from everyone. Now that I’m free, I thought things would finally be different, but since you brought me here, all I’ve done is hide. I feel like I’m still a fugitive. I watched all my friends and family die because no one came to save them. So no, the world won’t be here tomorrow. Not for everyone.”
* Sam sighs, “…You’re right. I’m sorry; I lost sight of what you’ve been through. I guess I let my ambition get the better of me. All right, no more waiting. We’ll go to Alan and Lora first thing tomorrow and we’ll tell them everything.”

—

* Meanwhile, Richard Mackie, in his apartment, does research on Sam Flynn, trying to dig up every misdemeanor he’s ever been convicted for. 
* Mackie is humiliated by his firing and vows to take Sam down. He’s not about to let some punk kid steal the company he’s spent the last decade working for.
* Mackie uses a special program he’s created named “Shift,” a program who specializes in getting behind firewalls and extracting data.
* As Mackie works, we cut back and forth between him and his program on the Grid (the Grid from the first movie). 
* Shift is a program in RED NEON CLOTHES driving a RED TANK. And of course, Shift looks identical to Mackie. 
* When they communicate, Shift says “End of Line” when he’s done.
* This whole scene mirrors the scene of Kevin Flynn breaking into ENCOM, early in the first movie with the original CLU. Shift even has a Bit.
* Mackie is trying to research Quorra, the mysterious woman whom Sam is sometimes seen with. He thinks she might be an illegal immigrant.
* Mackie does an internet search, and we see how the internet works on the Grid for the first time. 
* Shift approaches a large CIRCULAR GATEWAY that looks like a giant stargate, called a Hypertext Terminal.
* Above the terminal, there are four white GIANT WI-FI BARS.
* There are several of the terminals lined up and countless programs walk to and from them. An automated voice says, “Please mind your step as you enter the Hypertext Terminal.”
* When Programs enter their gateways, a TUBE of white light shoots out from the gateway connecting it to the next one. The Wi-Fi bars above the gate light up and shoot energy forward, becoming 3-D arch-shaped tubes parallel to the bottom tube.
* Shift dismantles his tank back into a baton and places it on his belt. He pulls another baton from his belt and walks up to a gateway with the word “Quorra” above it. The female voice says, “Key word search: Quorra. Connecting…”
* Then his gateway lights up and he runs through it, expanding his new baton into a LIGHT JET.
* It LAUNCHES his jet through the tube of light. As he travels, there are COUNTLESS other tubes of light next to his travelling in three directions: perpendicular horizontally, perpendicular vertically, and parallel. Some beams of light even change direction mid-journey at a Right Angle. It looks like a giant 3-D Circuit Board in the aether.
* Beneath it all is a black abyss - the DARK WEB. 
* Eventually, Shift arrives at a new Hypertext Terminal and exits the gateway.
* Here, there are more gateways with more specific searches. There’s a gate with the word “Quorra” in the logo of Quorra the website. There’s are gates with pictures of fictional characters with phoenetically similar names, such as “Cora”, “Korra” etc. 
* Back in the real world, Mackie is frustrated as he views the search results. None of this is what he’s looking for.
* While he’s researching, Ed “Eddie” Dillinger Jr. comes to his apartment. 
* He says to Mackie, “I hope there are no hard feelings between us since I stayed at ENCOM with the Flynn kid.” 
* Mackie ignores that and asks if he knows anything about this “Quorra” woman who travels with Sam Flynn. Eddie doesn’t know who she is.
* Mackie shows Eddie that there are no records of Quorra whatsoever. No driver’s license. No Social Security Number. No Birth Certificate. It’s as if she doesn’t exist.
* Mackie decides to use Quorra’s lack of identity in his case against Sam to bring him down, a case he might even take to court.

—

* Meanwhile, Sam & Quorra bring the laser with them to Alan & Lora’s house. After explaining that no, Quorra isn’t his girlfriend, he tells them everything about the Grid, CLU, the ISOs, Tron, etc. He introduces Quorra. “In other words, Mrs. Bradley,” he says, “Your machine worked.”
* Lora says it shouldn’t be possible. Digitizing an orange is one thing, but the algorithms necessary to properly transmute every atom of a human being are too complex for any person to calculate accurately. She and Walter told the CIA the same thing back in the 80s when the CIA first financed the project. That little snag was the reason it was abandoned.
* Quorra says the MCP was the one who calculated the algorithm and Kevin Flynn was able to save it and replicate it. He told her his story when they lived together. Flynn kept it a secret - even from Lora and Alan - because he feared Lora was being watched and bugged, and he wanted to study and master it himself before the government came to take it away.
* They go to the garage and Sam & Quorra activate the laser. They reset the spawn coordinates to the Portal, rather than the fake “Flynn’s Arcade”. Sam, Quorra, and Alan go down. Then Sam and Quorra take Lora down. They keep one person in the real world at all times. Just in case.
* Everything is exactly as they left it. Quorra has Kevin Flynn’s disc and Quorra’s disc is sitting on the bridge. Quorra merges the two together.
* When they return, Lora says they have to destroy the laser. No one can know about it. The weapons and technology this could bring about are too dangerous for any country or company to have. This creates friction with Quorra, as she wants to use it to revolutionize technology and medicine to help people. In addition to that, there are programs still on Flynn’s Grid who need help. She also wants to see if the ISOs can be recreated or if new ones can be made.
* After a heated debate, Quorra reluctantly agrees to destroy it. ENCOM has a facility that might be able to safely do it.

—

* However, the entire conversation is picked up by a wiretap in the house. The CIA has in fact been keeping an eye on Lora for years. 
* In Washington D.C., a CIA agent goes to the director and tells him someone cracked Digitization. He tells her Digitization is a fairy tale - but she plays the recording for him.

—

* Later, Sam, Quorra, Alan, and Lora pull up to ENCOM, but they are confronted by CIA field agents. 
* The CIA brings them into an LA office for questioning.
* Lora warns the CIA if they do this, they’re playing with fire. The CIA warns them all not to withhold valuable resources from the State. Other nations won’t care. ‘We have to be ahead of them in every way, as much as possible for our own safety’, they say.
* Quorra sides with the CIA, not because she trusts them, but because they want to develop Grid Tech. They want to advance medicine too. They also say they’ll contract exclusively with ENCOM and there are profits to be made. Sam considers this, as ENCOM under him has really started to tank financially.
* The CIA makes it clear they’re going to pursue this with or without Sam & Co, so Sam, Quorra, and Lora reluctantly agree to help while Alan makes sure things are running smoothly at the company.

Look, I'm not the kind of person who believes in ghosts or curses or any of that bullshit. I do financial analysis for a living. I make Excel sheets cry. I believe in things you can prove with data. So when I tell you what happened in my grandmother's house, understand that I fought against every word of this story until I couldn't anymore.


I moved in six months after Gran died. The place was ancient, full of her particular brand of organized chaos. Every floorboard had its own complaint, every wall its own stain or scuff mark. It was lived-in. It was real. It was home.
The first thing that went wrong was so small I almost missed it.


Gran had this teacup. Pale blue with gold leaf that was mostly worn away, and a hairline crack near the rim that she'd always said gave it character. ""Everything needs a little damage to be interesting,"" she used to say, tracing that crack with her finger. I drank coffee from it every morning—sentimental bullshit, but whatever. She was dead. I missed her.


One morning in April, I was washing it and ran my thumb along the rim out of habit. The crack was gone.
Not repaired. Gone. The porcelain was smooth and perfect, like it had just come from the factory.
I stood there holding this cup, water dripping off my hands, trying to make sense of it. Maybe I'd grabbed a different one. Maybe Gran had two identical cups and I'd never noticed. I tore the kitchen apart looking for the real one—the broken one—but there was nothing.


It was just a cup. It didn't matter. But something cold settled in my chest and wouldn't leave.
A few weeks later, I was walking down the hallway when I realized something was off. There used to be a deep gouge in the hardwood floor from when teenage me tried to move a dresser by myself. It was part of the geography of the house, something I stepped over every day without thinking.


*It wasn't there anymore.*
The floor was perfect. No scar, no sign of repair, no dust or filler. Just smooth, unblemished wood gleaming in the morning light.
That's when I started taking pictures.


It felt insane, but what else could I do? Every morning I'd walk through the house with my phone, documenting everything. The books on the nightstand. The magnets on the fridge. The way the quilt bunched up on my bed. I built an obsessive catalog of reality, timestamped and cross-referenced.


For two weeks, nothing changed. I started to feel stupid. I was grieving, stressed, seeing things that weren't there. The knot in my stomach loosened. Everything was fine.
Then I came home from work on a Thursday, tossed my keys in the bowl, and froze.


Gran's chair was gone.
Not moved. Gone. In its place was some sleek modern thing in charcoal gray that looked like it belonged in a dentist's office. I knew that chair like I knew my own face—ugly floral fabric, overstuffed arms, the faint smell of her lavender perfume still clinging to it.
My hands were shaking as I pulled up that morning's photos. There was the living room, exactly as I'd left it. And sitting in the corner was the gray chair.
Not Gran's chair. The gray chair. Like it had always been there.
I sat on the floor and hyperventilated.


The house wasn't just changing things. It was changing the evidence. My careful documentation, my anchor to reality—it was all compromised. The house was rewriting history, and I was the only one who remembered the original story.
After that, the silence felt different. Watchful. I'd catch a whiff of ozone in rooms where things had changed, sharp and clean like the air after lightning. The changes came faster. A painting of a storm at sea became calm water. Gran's handwritten grocery lists in the kitchen drawer turned into blank paper.


I understood then. It wasn't redecorating. It was sterilizing. Every mark of human life, every sign that someone had existed here—it was all being systematically erased. The house was becoming perfect, and perfection has no room for stories.
Two nights ago, I decided to fight back.
I took the biggest book I could find and slammed it into the bedroom wall, corner-first. The drywall crumpled, leaving a jagged hole about the size of my fist. It was violent and ugly and I felt good about it. I photographed it from every angle. ""Try erasing that,"" I said to the empty room.


I stayed awake all night, watching the bedroom door. Nothing happened. When the sun came up, I went to check.
The wall was smooth. No hole, no damage, no sign of repair. Just perfect, unmarked drywall.
I didn't feel surprised anymore. Just tired. So fucking tired.


That's when I realized I was fighting the wrong battle.
Yesterday, I took down the family photos. All of them. I drove to a dumpster behind the Kroger and threw them away. It felt like taking off shoes that were too tight.
Today, I noticed a chip in the kitchen counter where Gran had once dropped a cast iron pan. I got a hammer from the garage and smashed the whole tile to pieces. I'll replace it tomorrow with something clean and white and forgettable.


There's a strange peace in it. Like I'm finally working with the house instead of against it. We have the same goal now—to make this place perfect. To erase every trace of the messy, complicated people who used to live here.
There's just one more flaw left to fix.
I'm looking at myself in the bathroom mirror. There's a thin scar running through my left eyebrow from when I crashed my bike at nine years old. It's the last mark of my old life, the last piece of evidence that I was ever a child who made mistakes and got hurt and kept going anyway.


The house is waiting. Patient. Perfect.

You know how my kitchen counter used to look like a graveyard for coffee gadgets? I’d try one, end up with a cup that was either bitter or weirdly sour, and just move on to the next thing. I was about to give up and just accept mediocre coffee as my fate.



The real game-changer for me was finally understanding that it’s less about the machine and more about the control. That’s where the French press came in. It seemed almost too simple, but that’s the beauty of it. You’re in charge of the water temperature, the steep time, everything. I started using water that’s just off the boil and a coarser grind, and the difference was instant. No more acidity, just a really smooth, full-bodied cup.



Here’s the cool part I learned: the metal filter in a French press lets natural oils from the coffee beans pass through into your cup, which paper filters usually trap. Those oils are what give it that rich, almost velvety mouthfeel. It’s the difference between seeing a high-def picture and just hearing about it.



Now, my morning ritual is actually something I look forward to. It’s a quiet five minutes of pressing and pouring that feels a little fancy without any fuss. It fixed my acidic coffee problem and finally made that corner of my countertop make sense.

Two nights ago, I decided to fight back.
I took the biggest book I could find and slammed it into the bedroom wall, corner-first. The drywall crumpled, leaving a jagged hole about the size of my fist. It was violent and ugly and I felt good about it. I photographed it from every angle. ""Try erasing that,"" I said to the empty room.


I stayed awake all night, watching the bedroom door. Nothing happened. When the sun came up, I went to check.
The wall was smooth. No hole, no damage, no sign of repair. Just perfect, unmarked drywall.
I didn't feel surprised anymore. Just tired. So fucking tired.


That's when I realized I was fighting the wrong battle.
Yesterday, I took down the family photos. All of them. I drove to a dumpster behind the Kroger and threw them away. It felt like taking off shoes that were too tight.
Today, I noticed a chip in the kitchen counter where Gran had once dropped a cast iron pan. I got a hammer from the garage and smashed the whole tile to pieces. I'll replace it tomorrow with something clean and white and forgettable.


There's a strange peace in it. Like I'm finally working with the house instead of against it. We have the same goal now—to make this place perfect. To erase every trace of the messy, complicated people who used to live here.
There's just one more flaw left to fix.


I'm looking at myself in the bathroom mirror. There's a thin scar running through my left eyebrow from when I crashed my bike at nine years old. It's the last mark of my old life, the last piece of evidence that I was ever a child who made mistakes and got hurt and kept going anyway.


The house is waiting. Patient. Perfect.

1nqiher,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1nqiher/fire_fears_gat_fires_fiction/,Fire fears - GAT Fires (Fiction),"Journal — Sevier County, Tennessee

I don’t know how long I’ve been walking. Feels like forever. Smoke so thick it’s like someone poured a blanket over the whole world. Radio is dead. Battery’s gone or it’s just static. Tried every channel. Nothing. I can’t tell if the sky is still there or if the whole thing is just Godless orange. The GPS on my phone says Sevier County but the dots mean nothing when the trees are on fire.

We were near a ridgeline this morning, thought we had a plan. Thought. The wind changed like a hand and everything we practiced fell apart. I lost the crew somewhere between Old Mill and—shit—I can’t remember the names, everything’s a smear. I keep thinking I’ll see a reflective stripe, a boot, a helmet. Nothing.

My throat hurts like I swallowed sand. Took a breath trying to be brave and it tasted like metal. Coughing fits keep coming. I dropped my water once because the hose line got cut and the pressure went. I swear I’ll never stop thinking about that cold bottle. I can feel the strap of my pack digging into my shoulder; it’s heavy and useless and I can’t get it off without taking two hands and there are flames every way I look.

I tried to mark my path—left a glove on a log, scraped bark with my knife, kicked over a rock. Smoke eats it. Wind puts it back. The trees are popping like fireworks that never stop. An ember landed on a fern and in seconds it was a torch. I heard a barn crack apart like a matchbox. Sound rattles inside me.

If you find this, tell my kid—no, don’t let them read it alone. Tell them I was trying to help. Tell them I wasn’t stupid. Tell them I chose this. I chose to go into fire.

My stomach is a hollow cave. I keep thinking of coffee and pancakes and the stupid little diner off the highway. I keep thinking about breathing clean air. Small stupid things feel like big treasures. I keep replaying one dumb joke from the truck—how silly that feels now.

I thought I saw a road. I ran toward it and it led to a place that was a street ten minutes ago and now it’s gone — just hot air and ash. A mailbox, a porch swing, everything holding on to the last second before it leaves. I walked past a house where the porch light was still on like someone left it on for us. It’s like a stage set for disaster. I put my hand on the doorframe but the wood was already black and hot. I’m so tired of the smell of smoke.

My compass spins or my head does, I don’t know. I tried to climb higher to see, but the slope is loose and every footstep makes a small landslide of ash. I yelled for my partner. My voice came back thin and small, swallowed by the roar. My ears are full of it — not the helicopter that used to comfort me, just the fire. The sky used to have stars. I can’t see them.

I keep thinking of the dispatcher’s voice before everything went—calm, boring—telling us grid coordinates. I tried to replay them but only half stick. I’m not a scientist. I’m a man in a jacket getting smaller in a big bad thing. The training keeps wanting to be useful. Sometimes it is. Mostly I just follow instincts now, which is maybe the worst and maybe the only thing left.

There’s a flare of light on the ridge—maybe a rescue? Maybe a flare. Maybe it’s another house. I waved my helmet but my hands tremble so much I dropped my glove again. I don’t know how long I can keep moving. My boots are full of ash that cracks when I step. Every breath is hard. I feel like I’m carrying the mountain on my back.

If this is the end, I keep thinking of small things. The phone number on the fridge. The crooked picture in the hallway. The smell of my wife’s jacket from last winter. I don’t want this to be a last sentence on some paper but if it is, at least know I tried. I kept going because turning back meant other people might not get out. That’s what I told myself.

My lamp just died. Couldn’t see my watch anyway. Time’s a liar here. I’m moving toward a sound that might be water—maybe a creek? Maybe a busted pipe. I can’t trust anything but the sound of my own boots. I think about the dog next door and how he used to bark every morning. I think about the coffee again. 

I’m writing this on the back of a torn map because it feels right to put words where the paths used to be. Hands are shaking. Ink is blotchy. I keep hearing something that sounds like a chorus of dry wood saying goodbye.

God, I don’t want to stop. I don’t want to admit I can’t find the way. But the smoke is getting thicker, and the wind is a liar that laughs when you trust it. If anyone reads this years from now in Sevier County, know I loved the mountains even when they burned me. Tell my family I gave everything I had.

I’m trying to stand up now. There’s a hot gust. My lungs are burning. I’m scared and tired and all the words I’ve got left are for them—my people. I hear a distant crack like someone stepping on a giant bone.

If you can, please—please keep living. Keep the little diner open. Keep the porch swings. Keep the coffee warm for the people who come home.

I don’t know how to end this because endings are for books and this isn’t a book. I can only keep moving, one step, then another. The world is red and ash and heat. I love you. Tell them I did my job.",1,1758833986.0,story,0,1.0,False

I don’t sip coffee for flavor; I mainline it like a desperate novelist begging for plot twists. One cup gets my fingers twitching, two cups get the dialogue flowing, and by cup three I’m convinced I’ve written the next great American novel. 

Spoiler: it’s usually 4,000 words of characters sighing and staring at walls. But hey, the walls feel like they have depth when my heart rate is pushing 140 bpm.

For me, caffeine transforms mild procrastination into high-octane, jittery procrastination. Instead of calmly not writing, I frantically clean my desk, alphabetize my pens, and Google synonyms for “dark” until sunrise. 

Sure, every novel is powered by blood, sweat, and tears—but mine are mostly filtered through whatever Colombian roast was cheapest at Costco.

And then comes the crash. That sweet betrayal when caffeine abandons me and every “brilliant” sentence I wrote an hour ago now reads like the manifesto of a raccoon. 

My plot twists stop making sense, my metaphors turn into crimes against literature, and I swear I’ll quit coffee tomorrow. 

I won’t, of course.

Okay so this is going to be a doozy I feel but I’ll try to be brief. 

I use to wake up 2 hours before my job that starts at 8am. I would wake up at 4:30am, drink coffee, 2 bottles of water and be ready to shit within 15 mins. I want enough time to shit the majority of poop out of my system so I can come home around 2pm and continue if there’s anything left. I do not eat lunch because I am not usually hungry enough. 

Today was different. Last night me and my GF ate pizza, and French fries. I have been waking up at 6:30am to get ready which has not been an issue because forcing my body to poop when it’s not “ALERT WE NEED TO EVACUATE NOW” phase can be problematic. So as we leave and I drop her off at her job, we both are a sandwich from dunkin. Nothing out of the ordinary. 

Around 10am, I ran to the bathroom and because it was DIRE. After 35 mins, i finished up as I did not have the urge anymore. I get back to the office and everything is normal… until 1:53pm comes. My boss is female but I don’t believe that matters. 

My boss: “come here” 

Me: 😐 thinking “that’s blunt and maybe rude but whatever I guess, it’s fine” 

My boss: i have heard that you’ve been out of the office for some time and you know that, without clocking out, you are on company time.

Me: uhh, do you seriously want me to detail what happened in the bathroom or..? 

My boss: that’s not necessary but as with previous times, you have said that you need bathroom emergencies and I am also concerned about your health. You should tell me otherwise because we have “watchers” around here. That’s way if I know, our department doesn’t look bad and I can say “He’s accounted for, I know where he is” 

Me: it was an immediate emergency but yes, I understand. it’s embarrassing to mention what bathroom issue I need to do but I will from now notify you.

My boss: I understand. You’re young, Maybe you should get that checked out by a doctor. I have a niece that has Crohn’s disease and anything she ate could not digest and she had a living parasite inside of her. Now I’m being motherly towards you. *insert a smile that seriously looks forced you can imagine* 

Me: 😬😅 I see

My boss: we are family here 

I left and that was the end. I don’t believe in that “family at your job” garbage because gossip guys/girls and snakes in the bushes exist. I really hate that it’s so pushed. Buuutt i unfortunately enjoy the set hours of a government job while I’m in college. 

I don’t have Crohn’s disease dude 😭😭🤣 it’s CAFFEINE FROM TEA AND A SANDWICH BRO. How I found out that someone else knew is sort of creepy about this whole issue…. When I was almost done, I looked over in the next stall and there was a guy with brown colored shoes on and he was actually the same guy in our office. I looked at his shoes after this conversation and thought “are you seriously not going to let a person poop in peace?”. Maybe I was wrong but I just feel slightly unsettled, creeped out, and overall hate “corporation/government facades” just really to not make each other look bad for ridiculous reasons

I think I either want advice of maybe not eating at a specific time so I don’t lose my job over literal poop or I want clarity on if I’m actually insane. Maybe this should be reposted into somewhere else? Guide me otherwise since I couldn’t decide because it’s job related 😅.

Looking to expand my circle of friends as most of mine aren’t gamers or don’t share most of my other interests. I have recently connected with some guys from here and going strong with two of them and now talk regularly and occasionally play together.

I play single player games of any kind but predominantly RPGs, Action, Adventure and Puzzle. I always buy Horror games despite not having the constitution to play them (Dead Space being the exception). I have over 1000 hours in Capitalism Lab, essentially a business spreadsheet simulator and given the chance will talk endlessly about it! Not a fan of multiplayer or online gaming but have started doing some Borderlands 3 with two other guys met through here and slowly opening up to it though my reflexes are terrible!

Started out as a console gamer and switched to PC during Covid times and from the looks of it won’t be switching back anytime soon. That said I do enjoy my 3DS and may be looking at a Switch 1 at some point. I have a sizeable Steam collection and odds are I have some of the games you want to talk about (although likely not played them yet!) so this could be an opportunity to go through my long list of unplayed games.

In addition to gaming I’m also interested in photography, technology, anime, documentaries, museums, RC cars, full on home theatre and audiophile amongst other random interests.

Ideally looking for gamers who are 30+ as younger people are simply at a different stage in their life and I will probably be boring in comparison.

1nqi32b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nqi32b,Blood Test / PFS  / Proviron,"Hi Everyone, I live in Germany and I have been suffering from PFS for three years. This is my latest blood test update. All values are within the normal range, but I am still not sexually recovered.

I tried HCG for two months (500 IU every other day), but it didn’t help much and actually caused severe brain fog. My doctor recommended trying Proviron (half a tablet daily for one week) as a test to see how my body reacts, since all my hormone parameters look good. He also prescribed BPC-157, TB500, and Venofer (iron injections, 100 mg) because my ferritin is low (I drink too much coffee).

In my daily routine, I go to the gym 3–5 times per week and I don’t smoke.

The worst decision I ever made was in 2019, when I took Proviron and Stanozolol (40 mg daily) for two months. That caused sexual side effects and accelerated hair loss. After one year off Proviron and Stanozolol (while the sexual side effects never fully disappeared), I decided to take Finasteride—which made the problem worse.

I experimented with different doses of Finasteride (both topical and oral), but every time, after a while, I experienced side effects. I completely stopped Finasteride in 2022, but then I also tried other DHT-blocking products such as L-carnell and Nizoral.

The worst side effects came when I used CosmeRNA in June 2023. It was a new product on the market that I ordered from South Korea. After the third application, I experienced the worst side effects of my life: low mood, lack of motivation, and severe sexual dysfunction—which still persist today. My libido was completely destroyed.

Now, two years after stopping all medications, my main problem is that I am still not sexually recovered. I am always tired, have low energy, and my libido is gone. I just want to return to normal like before.

If anyone can help or make recommendations based on my blood test results, I would really appreciate it.",1,1758833026.0,FinasterideSyndrome,0,0.67,False

I use to wake up 2 hours before my job that starts at 8am. I would wake up at 4:30am, drink coffee, 2 bottles of water and be ready to shit within 15 mins. I want enough time to shit the majority of poop out of my system so I can come home around 2pm and continue if there’s anything left. I do not eat lunch because I am not usually hungry enough. 

Today was different. Last night me and my GF ate pizza, and French fries. I have been waking up at 6:30am to get ready which has not been an issue because forcing my body to poop when it’s not “ALERT WE NEED TO EVACUATE NOW” phase can be problematic. So as we leave and I drop her off at her job, we both are a sandwich from dunkin. Nothing out of the ordinary. 

Around 10am, I ran to the bathroom and because it was DIRE. After 35 mins, i finished up as I did not have the urge anymore. I get back to the office and everything is normal… until 1:53pm comes. My boss is female but I don’t believe that matters. 

My boss: “come here” 

Me: 😐 thinking “that’s blunt and maybe rude but whatever I guess, it’s fine” 

My boss: i have heard that you’ve been out of the office for some time and you know that, without clocking out, you are on company time.

Me: uhh, do you seriously want me to detail what happened in the bathroom or..? 

My boss: that’s not necessary but as with previous times, you have said that you need bathroom emergencies and I am also concerned about your health. You should tell me otherwise because we have “watchers” around here. That’s way if I know, our department doesn’t look bad and I can say “He’s accounted for, I know where he is” 

Me: it was an immediate emergency but yes, I understand. it’s embarrassing to mention what bathroom issue I need to do but I will from now notify you.

My boss: I understand. You’re young, Maybe you should get that checked out by a doctor. I have a niece that has Crohn’s disease and anything she ate could not digest and she had a living parasite inside of her. Now I’m being motherly towards you. *insert a smile that seriously looks forced you can imagine* 

Me: 😬😅 I see

My boss: we are family here 

I left and that was the end. 

I don’t have Crohn’s disease dude 😭😭🤣 it’s CAFFEINE FROM A TEA AND A SANDWICH BRO 

I think I either want advice of maybe not eating at a specific time so I don’t lose my job over literal poop or I want clarity on if I’m actually insane. Maybe this should be reposted into AIO?

Fall always makes me want to slow down a little, warm drinks, softer evenings, and something relaxing to do when the weather turns cooler. That’s why I think a **cozy puzzle book** is such a perfect match for the season.

There’s something about puzzles that feels both calming and engaging at the same time. Word searches let you sink into autumn themes, pumpkins, falling leaves, cozy drinks, while crosswords spark your curiosity, and sudoku challenges your focus in the best way. It’s the kind of quiet activity that helps you unwind without feeling idle.

What I enjoy about the **Cozy Fall Puzzle Book** in particular is the variety. With word searches, crosswords, and sudoku all in one place, I can pick whatever suits my mood. Some evenings I just want something light, other times I want a puzzle that makes me stop and really think. And since it’s compact at 6×9 inches, I can keep it on the coffee table or slip it into a bag when I head out.

It’s not about rushing to finish every puzzle, it’s more about having a small ritual that feels relaxing and seasonal. Whether you’re looking for something mindful for yourself or a thoughtful autumn gift, a cozy puzzle book fits right in.

1nqhwff,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nqhwff,MN To Yellowstone Road Trip Update,"I posted a few months ago about 4 adults (two married couples) going on a kid-free cross-country trip. You can see my original itinerary in my post history. We stuck pretty close to it, with a few changes before and during the trip, and had a fantastic time. Yellowstone starts at Day 6, if you want to skip ahead, and all the photos are Yellowstone.

We had a few hot days and a few chilly days, but overall the weather was perfection, we had minimal traffic delays, the crowds were mostly manegable, and despite being a massive, unapologetic introvert I rarely felt overwhelmed and nobody blinked when I put my earbuds in and checked out for a while.

Day 1: Left home at 8am. Got lunch at Murphs Burgers in Souix Falls, definitely recommend. Stopped briefly at the Corn Palace, mainly as a joke on one of our members. Spent a couple hours at the Mitchell Indian Site. We were \*almost\* the only people, which was fantastic. Got to Wall about 7. Had supper at the Badlands Saloon & Grille--don't recommend. Not sure how they got such good reviews, everything tasted boxed/canned/frozen, and the hot beef came cold in the middle. The summer berry salad was delicious but the lettuce was cut in loooong strips that made eating wierd.

Day 2: Could not find an open coffee house for iced coffee--warning, if you're visiting after Labor Day there are limited coffee options and Google doesn't reflect that. We visited Delta 09 and the Minuteman Visitor Center. We weren't able to get tickets for the tour, but those two alone were great stops. After that we stopped at the prairie dog ranch store and fed the prairie dogs. We then drove through the Badlands, stopping to do a couple hours of hiking and exploring, as well as at the visitor center there. Then we headed back to explore Wall Drug and had supper at Red Rock, which was delicious. As we left dinner intended to head to the hotel for pool & hot tub time we saw a storm rolling in, and decided to head back out to the Badlands and watch it come in from an overlook for over an hour. Made it back to the hotel just before 10pm.

Day 3: Struck out again on our coffee hunt. Visited Dahls Chainsaw art, grabbed donuts at Wall Drug, and headed to the Mammoth Site at Hot Springs. After that we hiked Cathedral Spires and up Devils Tower (not the monument) to an elevation of 6,959. We watched a storm threaten but blow over, and were able to watch it in the distance from Devils Tower, finishing our hike just after dark. We had grand ideas of pizza, but alas, had to settle for Subway and were a bit grumpy about it. Unfortunately, we then got lost on our way to our cabin and didn't arrive until nearly midnight. Google did us real dirty, I did not put the cabin directions in the paper copy of the itinerary, and we had zero cell service. It was a wierd mixture of funny and annoying, topped with the concerning news from home we recieved right before losing all service.

Day 4: Concerning home news resolved. Trip continues with a lazy morning. We head into Custer and grab breakfast from Bakers Bakery. The breakfast sandwiches were fantastic, the pastries excellent, the cake delicious. We grabbed lunch to go at Custer Deli, which had solid sandwiches that I would absolutely get again. After packing our lunches into our packs we headed to Sylvan Lake, where we hiked to Black Elk Peak via trail 9, to an elevation of 7,244. Totally worth it, but the last mile of that trail on the way up kicked my butt. After hiking we finally got our pizza.

Day 5: Headed out early. Stopped in Buffalo, WY to go to church with friends, then moseyed over to Cody via Tensleep vs the original path that would have taken us by Shell Falls. Spent about two hours at the Buffalo Bill Center of the West, had dinner at the Irma (and we stayed in one of the original rooms). Dinner was great. We then watched Mclintock with John Wayne, just because.

Day 6: Our planned 9am rafting trip was cancelled the night before, so we had some time open up. Got breakfast at the Irma, and was rather disappointed. Supper had been so good, and several people had insisted breakfast was even better, but it wasn't even as good as supper had been. I dislike bread pudding, but the bread pudding at dinner had changed my mind. The same bread pudding at breakfast was... fine. Not as good as it had been at dinner. Possibly due to the higher number of dinner patrons and thus fresher bread pudding at the buffet? Did some shopping, and headed out for Yellowstone. We headed to Red Lodge and took Beartooth Pass in. 10/10 would recommend, it was a fanstastic, beautiful drive. I think we spent about 4.5 hours meandering our way through the pass, stopping at quite a few overlooks. Came into Lamar Valley about 6pm, and were immediately greeted by bison herds on both sides, with pronghorn deer just down the road, and a herd of elk in Mammoth. Made it to our cabin in Gardiner about 8, went out for burgers somewhere that I don't remember. It was good.

Day 7: Grabbed coffee at Yellowstone Perk. Danish was good, sandwich was okay, the huckleberry coffee was better than expected. Visited Mammoth, Norris Geyser Basin, and Artists Paint Pots. Norris was my personal favorite, especially the Porcelain Basin. One of them--Guardian?--was feeling very active, and they had the boardwalk around it roped off. If I had to choose to see only Mammoth or Norris I would pick Norris. It had such a variety and was a lot of fun. We attempted to eat at Wonderland Cafe that night, but they were full, so we grabbed pizza from Yellowstone Pizza and found it very blah and disappointing.

Day 8: Got coffee and breakfast from Bears Brew. The wait was long, but worth it, and we came back here several times. On our way to the Canyon we saw a mama black bear and her cub nearly on the road, another black bear completely ignoring a deer, and a grizzly. We intended to drive the north rim, possibly hike down to Brink of the Lower Falls, then do a 6 mile hike on the south rim. We chose to switch the order and do the hike first, and good thing too. We took a wrong path and our 6-mile hike turned into a 9 mile hike. We intended to do the red portion (and we had a map) but somehow did the orange portion. Still, it was a beautiful hike and a lot of fun. We found an old bison skeleton, bear poop, walked past unnamed geysers, and had bufflo standing on our path, but the extra milage made hiking back the south rim less fun than it would have been if we'd been fresher. We got back so late we chose to skip driving the north rim and we were not up for any more hiking. We also knew we wouldn't make it back in time to eat at Wonderland, so we chose to head back to our cabin, scarf down some leftovers/snacks, and soak in the hot springs before packing up all our stuff to check out in the AM.

Day 9: Packed up all our stuff, but we decided we wanted an extra day in Yellowstone. We couldn't extend our cabin stay, but found a beautiful room at Wonderland Lodge for the night. We did part of the Lava Creek trail and stopped at overlooks we hadn't had time to before. Saw another grizzly, another black bear, some mountain goats, a raven being goofy. Drove Blacktail Plateau, memorable stops include Mud Volcano and Sulpher Caldron. Petrified Tree was not worth the stop, but we've also been to Petrified Forest NP before. Finally got our supper at Wonderland Lodge & Cafe, and was not disappointed. Did some final shopping.

Day 10: Said goodbye to Gardiner. Hiked at Sheepeater Cliff for a while, but not the whole trail. What we did (to the waterfall) was perfection. Made our way towards Old Faithful, stopping and doing whatever seemed good along the way. Lower Geyser Basin was on our itinerary, but by the time we made it we were feeling the time crunch. Stopped at Midway Geyser Basin, then went down the road to hike to Fairy Falls. After that we visited Black Sand Geyser Basin, which we loved, then made it to Old Faithful just before 6pm, with a predicted 6:13 eruption. Old Faithful didn't actually erupt until nearly 6:30, and then felt rather anticlimactic. Spouse and I decided we would do Old Faithful first when we return in a couple years with our kiddos. Left for Buffalo, WY, saw a river otter or beaver in Yellowstone Lake at sunset, and made it about midnight.

Day 11: Left Buffalo for Rapid City, where we spent the night and went to Press Start for supper and arcade games. Had a lot of fun, it was a good way to end the trip, and took the sting off leaving my pillow in Buffalo.

Day 12:  Woke up to texts from kiddos asking when we'd be home. Travelled the 9 hours with minimal stops. Vacation mode was over, despite all the fun we were ready to be done, be home, see our kids. Our trip was packed full, we were often confused what day it was and had we REALLY only just done such-and-such a thing that morning? Did we really hike that just yesterday? We're planning to bring the kiddos to the Black Hills are next year, and hopefully Yellowstone the year after.

1nqhuju,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nqhuju,How Hobby Lobby paint and garage sale chairs brought hope back to our porch 🌈✨,"The chairs were supposed to be for our new apartment patio. That's what I told myself when I spotted them at the garage sale for ten bucks. Two weathered outdoor rockers that had seen better days, but the bones were solid.

What I didn't tell the seller was that I had nowhere to put them yet. I was three weeks out from losing our house to foreclosure, living in a cramped studio with my eight-year-old daughter while we waited for our rental application to get approved.

But something about those chairs whispered ""hope"" to me. Maybe it was imagining mornings where we'd sit together with coffee and cereal, watching the sunrise from our own little space again. Maybe it was the desperate need to believe we'd have a porch to put them on someday.

I spent every evening after my daughter went to bed working on them in the apartment complex's storage room. Stripped the old finish, sanded every slat by hand, and painted them in the brightest colors I could find—rainbow stripes that practically shouted ""we made it through the storm."" I even grabbed a few **Hobby Lobby paints and brushes** to get the perfect shades.

The transformation took two weeks. When I was struggling with which paint combinations would look best together, I found this amazing color theory guide from an artist on the Tedooo app. She actually messaged me back with encouragement when I shared my progress photos, saying she'd been in a similar situation and that creating something beautiful during hard times was like planting seeds of hope.

Three days after I finished the chairs, we got approved for the rental house. It has a small covered porch that faces east, perfect for morning coffee and watching my daughter ride her bike in the driveway.

Now when neighbors walk by, they always compliment the ""happy chairs."" My daughter named them Rainbow and Sunshine. She doesn't know they were my way of believing in our future when everything felt impossible.",1,1758832477.0,HobbyLobbyCommunity,0,1.0,False

1nqhmzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1nqhmzp/just_need_to_let_it_out_and_need_emotional_support/,Just need to let it out and need emotional support,"This is my first post, so please be kind. My mother was diagnosed with dementia before covid. I actually found out just before lockdowns happened. Obviously, she's been declining since. Last August my father passed very unexpectedly and when he did she took a HUGE downturn. My husband and I were there when it happened, and the only people with her. It was brutal, with her screaming at me for lying to her and her asking over and over where it was and demanding me to go into details about everything that happened. Those first few days were horrific. She didn't sleep and would open my door (we were staying at the house) every five minutes asking about him, then going between anger and grief. It was so intense that I ended up in a full blown panic attack after a few nights of it. Nothing was planned for either, so it made things even more difficult. We had to take care of all the details of my father all while she was blocking our way. (my brother was helping, but he didn't stay with her until after I had the panic attack and my husband said I HAD to have a night away, then we were back there again.) After the funeral and everything arrangements were made for 24/7 caregivers at the house. I had panic attacks for a while after I got home and was unable to sleep. I'd wake up to every little sound. I started therapy not long after and it's helped a lot. 

My mother doesn't call me, never has. But after I came home (I live across the border now) she'd call and be upset. I tried my best, but I had to unplug the phone for a while to survive. It wasn't doing either of us any good and she wouldn't remember it anyway. I know I sound cold and heartless, but I just couldn't handle the screaming at me, telling me that I was lying, then that I'd taken over the funeral plans and not let her have a say (nothing could be further from the truth), then screaming at me about how horrible I was that I wasn't there for the funeral or for not moving back to be with her. I could say that it's entirely the dementia and try to push it aside, but when I moved away initially she disowned me, so this really isn't anything new. I was never good enough, always put down, etc. I still called her even after everything. We were going to visit right after Christmas, but she screamed at me for not wanting to stay at the house that I broke down. My husband took the phone and she screamed at him as well- and hung up on him. So we didn't go. I couldn't stay there. 1) it would retraumatize me, and 2) I fully believe that it'd bring her right back to that August day. I think it was January when I got her on an okay phone call (still was calling regularly) and she started guilt tripping me for not calling enough. I gave her an ultimatum- if you stop telling me how bad I am and that I don't do enough I'll call more often, but if you don't I won't call as much. Somehow it got through. She's kept herself in check and phone calls have generally been okay. (wish I'd done that years ago.)

We visited a few times over the summer (but it gets expensive staying in hotels!). I'd see her a couple times, but I have to go in the middle of the week so we have work as an excuse to only see her one day and not stay there. She can't know we stay elsewhere. But we go and I call regularly. I've met the aides and have an idea of what's going on. I'm not her POA and not on any of her finances, so I don't know everything. The aides kind of scratch their heads on that one, but it's honestly for the best that I'm not. We've had mostly good visits and have learned our limits.

Yesterday I called her in the morning and everything was 'okay'. Not great, but I could get a few chuckles out of her. Last week when I called her one day she seemed to forget who she was talking to partway through, so I know there's another decline. She does forget people, but she always remembers me. I also don't have to tell her who I am when I call. Yet. Mornings are best for calls, so that's when I phone. Well, in the afternoon the phone rang and it was her number. Again, she never calls. I answered it. She was very upset because she didn't know where my father was and there was a woman there that was telling her that he was dead, lying to her. I had to tell her again that it was true. She's 'there' enough that I can't pretend. It brought August right back to me. I had to explain everything again, and keep telling her details and try to reassure her. She didn't believe it and I had to tell her where she keeps the framed obit on a shelf next to where he used to sit. She was so upset that she didn't remember it. And it was a year ago!? She was horrified and so upset and not understanding how she couldn't remember something so important. You mean I've been on my own for a year?! I explained that we've visited and helped and she's got people helping her, that there was one there right now. I feel so awful for her. All I could do was reassure her that she's safe. She asked if I wanted to talk to the woman that was there, so I did. I made sure she wasn't on the other phone so I could really talk. It was the aide's first day and maybe that's what triggered everything? I gave her a contact to see if she could come over. And I gave her a rundown of things that might help and all that, and just to reassure her and make sure she knows she's safe. Then she let me know my mother picked up, so I just tried to not sound like I was talking about her, and let my mother hear us caring about her.

My anxiety level is through the roof right now. I don't know what I'm asking. I don't. Support? I realize that other people have it much harder being right there with the person, but not being there physically is also its own kind of hell. I know by today she won't remember any of this. But I will. I know it's all downhill. I feel helpless. There's a lot more to the situation, but I can't really go into details. Let's just say 'it's complicated' and there's nothing anyone can do. Her finances are dwindling and in home care is crazy expensive. She absolutely doesn't want to ever move, but I don't know how this is sustainable. She tells me every call she wishes I lived closer. Last week one day she also said if she knew how to do herself in she would. I know she means it. I feel horrible, but I wish she could just have a heart attack or something, let her go the 'easy' way. This disease is so cruel. My father was the one keeping her going. He was her life. She always said that her worst fear was losing her mind and that she wanted to go before that ever happened. 

I'm sorry this is so long, but I honestly have zero support system. I moved when I was older (we just couldn't make it where we were) and I've got nobody. I don't even have anybody to go out for coffee with. I feel like maybe I don't really have a right to feel this way because I'm not right there with her. But like I said, being unable to be there and not having access to any of her health records or financials or to legally know anything from the aides (they've been awesome; they know that she'd want me to know some things) is its own special kind of hell. I guess I'm just kind of reaching out to... whatever. Help...

But I am very overwhelmed right now because I am pregnant and it’s harder for me to find the energy to clean. I have asked him so many times why he won’t get up and throw his trash away and he always jokes back the cat nocks trash over onto the ground and the trash is too far away. I’m sick of living in filth because there’s constantly soda cans or crumbs falling on my carpet as well as wrappers and other garbage left on the coffee table. To add yesterday he was wood carving a wand for a kids birthday party and of course got a lot of the shavings on the carpet so I said “you’re gonna vacuum that right” and he just said maybe. This morning I woke up and he said his mom is coming over this afternoon so of course that means I’m cleaning that up too because he won’t be back until she’s on her way. I don’t know what to do anymore because he will tell me it’s my job to clean since we made an agreement a little while ago he’d pay the bills if I cleaned and I would only be working part time since I’m building a clientele. I’ve also recently gone back to working at great clips which takes a lot more energy out of me. How do I get him to be cleaner because every time I ask him he’ll make an excuse or say he’ll get to it later but later is two weeks

It seems to be something of a ritual to share with the Reddit community afterwards so here it is.



\[Resources used\]

1)Udemy Andrew Ramdayal course

2)Youtube(David Mclachlan, Andrew Ramdayal)

3)PMI Study Hall



\[Total hours spent on studying\]

\- Udemy Andrew Ramdayal course (35hr)

\- Application (10hr)

\- David Mclachlan Waterfall/Agile/PMBOK Youtube videos (\~10hr)

\- Andrew Ramdayal Ultra Hard Youtube Video (3hr)

\- PMI Study Hall Practice Questions/Mini Exam x 2 & Review (\~30hr)

\- PMI Study Hall Full Exam & Review (30hr)

Total : \~120hr(2025/03 \~ 2025/09)

(I had 2 young children(3yo and 3mo) so I could only invest 1-1.5hour/day if that. If you've got more time, by all means pack it into a shorter timeframe.)



\[My process\]

I had some on-the-job experience as a junior PM(\~3years), but had zero knowledge theory-wise.

Like I had never heard of 'agile'.



I wouldn't say the Udemy course itself helped me that much. I just watched it for the PDUs.

Once my application had passed, I started by watching DM Youtube videos.(I recommend pausing the video to answer the question yourself before he gives it away.)

Once I had gone thru his videos, I felt like I had some rudimentary grasp of the concepts.



After that I got myself a PMI Study Hall pass

I did the practice questions and mini exams, reviewing the questions I got wrong.(I heavily relied on ChatGPT PMI Infinity to ask and unpack questions. It isn't always accurate, but very useful on the whole.)

I did the practice questions and mini exams twice.(First round I scored in the 60s, second round 80s and above.)



Then I moved onto the full-length mock exams with 3 weeks left to go.

Basically 1 exam every 3-4days.

The first 3 mock exams, I split up each exam into 3 sections(just like the real exam), giving myself 80min(70min for doing the questions and 10min for reviewing flagged questions).

The last 2 mock exams, I did them in a real exam-like setting, doing them in one sitting with 10min breaks between sections.



I scored above 70% in the first 3 exams, and below 70% in the last 2 exams.

I was definitely discouraged by the dropping scores, but later realized these last 2 exams had disproportionately large number of Expert level questions, which the Reddit community all seemed to agree aren't worth losing sleep over.



Once I had completed all full-length exams, I still wasn't feeling quite ready, but didn't want to redo the exams.

So I decided to watch the Andrew Ramdayal Ultra Hard Question video just to sharpen up a little bit.(I didn't get thru the whole thing.)



At this point, with 2 days left, I just went thru my notes a few times and refrained from doing any heavy studying.

The day before the exam, I went thru my notes once, and went for a long walk to tire my body out for a good night's sleep.



On the exam day, I woke up at 5am, had some water and food, did a nice big poo, drank some coffee, and arrived early at the test center. I was the first to be admitted and was able to get started in a nice quiet room with nobody else around.



Throughout the test, I felt reasonably confident but felt like it could go either way.(Couldn't stop thinking about all the ways i'd celebrate if i passed lol)

I think I flagged about 10-20 questions per section.(Make sure to leave 10 minutes for reviewing flagged questions per section).



Needless to say, upon receiving that piece of paper that had the word 'pass' on it, I nearly broke into tears.

Just all the times I had to coordinate with my wife to carve out a study session with the kids crying in the background, the days i had to stealthily wake up at 4am to get some studying in, it all flooded back.

Honestly, even if this certification doesn't help me with my career, it was a great exercise in setting a goal, coming up with a plan and following through. Most of all, I'm just fucking happy that I proved it to myself, because I definitely had moments of doubt during the journey.



\[Final thoughts\]

\-Doing the full length mock tests is a must. It's a long exam and by the third section you're totally fried. It helps to know that you've done it before.

\-I know the term 'mindset' is cryptic af but all it means it you need to be able to recognize and categorize the questions and pair it with the appropriate answer choice. For example, when there is conflict then you do \[blank\], when there is scope change then you do \[blank\], when there is risk then you do \[blank\]. When you've done enough questions you'll be able to see which 'category' of question it is and look for answer accordingly. It's basically a formula. So going into the exam, you need this 'mindset' built in.  


Anyways I hope this is helpful.

I want to say a big thank you to the Reddit Community for the tips and pointers.

Good luck!

She owns at least two dozen, probably more. She uses three cups a day. Her morning coffee goes in one, a flavored water goes in the second, and then a third goes with her to work empty so she can put whatever else she wants in there that day. For the last couple of years, I've put up with it. We've been married 9 years and the only assigned chores are that I do the lawn care and the garbage (smell of garbage can make her vomit). We equally cook and clean and do laundry and anything else that needs to be done whenever we see it needs to be done. 

Chores have never been a point of contention until March of this year. I took a lateral position that changed my work style significantly. I now work from home four days a week with the fifth being a half day split between two offices. I'm home by 3:00 on those days. So because of that, I've taken on way more of the chores. I'm not complaining about most of it because I can do it and my life is much easier than it was before. The problem is my wife's habits. Because her office is so remote, lunch options are limited, so she tends to take all the leftovers from dinner. The issue is that she will leave the dirty, unrinsed containers in her car for days at a time and then just stack them up in the sink for me to deal with. Between the insanely bad smell and filling up the bottom drawer of the dishwasher every few days with Stanleys, I'm over it. In addition to the numerous cups, she also expects the matching lid and straw to be reassembled before storage. 

  
I told her that if she wants to continue ignoring my requests to bring her containers in every day, or to at least rinse them out at work, then she has to do the dishes from now on. Now, according to her, I'm being unreasonable. Because I'm home and don't have any commute time, I have way more free time than she does, and so I should take on the majority of the chores. But from my view, I've done exactly that. Since the change, I do nearly everything. Vacuuming, mopping, cleaning/folding/storing clothes, grass, garbage, and most of the cooking. I don't think it's particularly fair to expect me to also deal with her stinky tupperware and mountain of cups along with the sorting of the accessories after.

The people before my shift almost never restock, so I have to rush to restock before the restaurant gets busy—sometimes in less than a minute it’s already packed. I even have to restock the fry dispenser.

I get a 30-minute break, which sounds fine, but I have to get my own food and that can take about 10 minutes depending on how busy both drive-thru and front are. While I’m on break, customers will still ask me to take their order or help with something and I don’t refuse because I don’t want to fight—so that eats up another 10 minutes. Sometimes I’m left with only 5–10 minutes of actual break.

I’m also in school, and I haven’t had time to do my homework—even the work I bring to my job hoping to finish on break. I have an upcoming test I still need to study for, but I just can’t find the time. I’m Christian, and I’ve been trying to pray, read my Bible, or do a Bible study, but I don’t have time. I have ADHD, anxiety, and panic disorder, which only adds to the stress.

I feel like I have no time for anything. After work on Fridays I go to church until 10 p.m. On Sundays I’m at church from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m., and on Mondays I have school.


Yes, I get paid $13 an hour, but is that really enough for all this? I stand for 8 hours straight. During a rush, it’s just me in my station with 50 customers ordering 50 different things with endless customizations and complaints. When people stop to complain, I’m thinking, “The longer we talk, the longer it takes to pack your food and everyone else’s.” Then drive-thru customers come to complain. If customers can’t decide or employees leave unwanted orders, I have to call my manager from across the store for his fingerprint approval, which slows me down even more while more people keep coming in.

I’ve had people demand we remake perfectly good orders. I’m exhausted. It wouldn’t be so bad if I had another person with me in this station every day, or if someone was consistently making drinks and fries or restocking—basically like how the drive-thru is staffed. It also wouldn’t be so bad if customers weren’t so impatient and rude. And on top of all that, I also clean the lobby—sweep, mop, wipe surfaces.

I don’t know about other McDonald’s locations, but at ours we only get small fries and either one McDouble or a McChicken—nothing else. Small soft drinks and small waters are free with unlimited refills, but no coffee, sweet tea, lemonade, frozen drinks, or frappes.",3,1758831393.0,McDonaldsEmployees,2,1.0,False

As i try to get settled into this new role of being a wife. I’d like to work on myself and feel like a real human. I came from a tiny home where i could not explore hobby’s or work on hair or make up due to space. I feel like a plane jane but id like to refine my lifestyle. He met me when i was transferring to my university. I have some goals such as finally learning how to drive. I pay 40% of the bills, i cook more of the meals, i do most of the home shopping. he is tidy and builds the furniture. i acknowledge and im thankful for what he does, he makes more than me. at some point we think of having kids and i can stay home. 

once a month i volunteer at a community garden. i like old movies but may not understand them fully, something he gives me shit about. i like early 2000s punk rock music, coffee, and reading. but i fear a lot of people my age like that too. so i’m not going to label as something that makes me unique or stand out. i was into ceramics before marrying but it can take a lot of my time. i was briefly into skating but i have yet to pick up the hobby again. 

he has had the fortune of spending and trial/error hobbies that make him who he is. i don’t see myself running a marathon or climbing much of the corporate ladder. We have argued about it and i tell him what does he think i should do? Do you think getting a business or charity would make me feel like a person with personality/interests…? What can someone like myself do, to feel more whole or more certain and not loser like? i like who i am and im slowing getting out of my depression hole. something he does no believe in. he thinks i want to take anti depressants just because. but they have truly changed my life in ways that help me function. im just a little hesitant to waste money trying things i may not like. i’m a huge goodie two shoes i just stay out of trouble although i can be a little foolish by not having a lot of normal life experiences. I get that’s a reason why i haven’t explored a lot on who i am or what i can be. But it’s not like im doing terrible for myself either. 

sorry for any typos im on mobile vers

1nqhcx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/PsychotherapyHelp/comments/1nqhcx9/how_do_i_change/,How do I change?,"Hi, I have a question. I hope you can help.

Namely, I have started seeing this therapist here in Sarajevo and I have already scheduled a 2nd session for October. The problem is that I don't know how to explain some of my complaints. I socialize very little, I find it very difficult. I am 25 years old. I have been assaulted in several occasions already and the trauma has taken its toll.

These issues with socializing are common for middle/high school, not my age. I hang out only with one friend (F) who is very critical. The girl is a perfectionist, which I dislike, but it's not like I'm in a position to say no when she asks me to go out - I have no other friends.  
I only pretend to listen to her because I  would not have a social life if it weren't for her. I really don't have any other friends. I go out for coffee with family members and that's it.

I am ashamed to say this in psychotherapy. Namely, I graduated from psychology myself. It really is humiliating.

Basically, I don't know how to tell interesting stories, I'm overweight (thyroid issues) and have unstable mood swings. All this has led me to watching people live their lives, while I rot.

  
Also, I have been assaluted multiple times by unknown men. I am scared to leave my house at times.

Please, do you have any advice? How can I overcome this?",1,1758831367.0,PsychotherapyHelp,0,1.0,False
1nqhcsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntsvilleAlabama/comments/1nqhcsy/im_so_isolated/,Im so isolated,"I've lived here essentially my entire life just barring a year and some. I'm 29 and I genuinely have one friend in this city and shes a little tied up with having her second kid recently.

I've had friends but was just never in the right crowd and now I'm reaping I guess. I'm decently attractive, I'm tall enough, i think I'm funny, I think I express care; I just dont get it.

2018 was the last time I made a lasting friend and idk he's too depressed to get back with me fr. 

Honestly I feel like such a loser and dont know what to do. People didnt really talk to me at my last job, I had multiple people avoid eye contact with me and made me feel weird as fuck. It was a hardware store and I'm gay is that it? There was a gay supervisor who would also be excluded decently but he was kinda a weirdo. He allegedly (from his own mouth) made up some story about the size of my dick to tell some customers. I quit after that and like a year of isolation there. Honestly the isolation was the worst part.

I'm gonna go to something this Saturday but if I'm being honest, I dont make enough money to just go out over and over and trying to make small talk with people. I dont have any siblings and I know I'll never be a groomsman much less a best man, which I guess boo hoo? 

I recently got ghosted pretty hard and I'm so fucked up about it, is there anyone normal on here that would be down to get coffee and just hang out?

Is there like an app I could be using? Is there a way to meet people without spending money? The library doesn't count because who is there to talk outside of the café.

I feel like I have mental health issues from being so isolated but now I think those issues are also pushing the isolation. I called a therapy place 2 weeks ago and they made it very clear to not leave a second message. I guess they'll never get back to me and I've just wasted my time. I guess I'll try somewhere else, but honestly whats the point of working on myself just to be improved by myself inside of four walls?

Edit: There has been such a big response to this. So many suggestions and even people reaching out, I really appreciate it! It might take a little to sift through, some things ive seen i know i havent heard of",59,1758831360.0,HuntsvilleAlabama,46,0.82,False

You know, it’s funny—I was just thinking the other day about that one time we tried to do laundry on our long camping trip. We ended up with socks and t-shirts draped over every bush and tree branch around the tent. It felt a little like we were signaling to aliens.



That whole experience is what finally made me look into how full-time van-lifers handle it. Turns out, a lot of them swear by portable washer and dryer combos. I was skeptical at first, but we got a compact one that hooks up to our kitchen sink. It’s not much bigger than a slow cooker, but it completely changed the game on the road. No more searching for a laundromat in the middle of nowhere.



Here’s the part that really got me, though. I read that before modern portable machines, some sailors and explorers would actually wash their clothes by putting them in a bag and tossing it overboard, letting the ship’s movement and the seawater do the scrubbing. It makes our little electric spinner seem pretty luxurious by comparison.



It’s not a magic bullet—you still have to hang things up to dry unless you get a model with a dryer function—but it solved the biggest headache. Now, doing a small load feels less like a chore and more like just another part of making coffee. It’s a small thing, but it makes this mobile life feel a lot more civilized.
