I've finally decided to download a dating app out of curiosity and have made plans to meet a guy for a coffee. Only issue is I'm worrying about being a 'catfish'. I don't have what many would consider to be perfect teeth, and although it's not something I plan on changing, I understand that it may not be everyone's preference. I don't often smile with my teeth in photos so none of my profile photos showed my teeth. Is it best to be honest and bring this up before we meet in person, or should I just go on the date and see what happens?",1,1769120081.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1qk8gbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qk8gbi/why_does_asking_a_girl_out_have_to_be_like_a_job/,Why does asking a girl out have to be like a job interview.,"I’m 28M gonna be 29M in June I posted this similar thing a couple days ago. Here’s what I’m tired of I feel like everytime I talk to a girl I get to know her I ask her out on a date. There’s just something that feels like I don’t know. I get this feeling like dating is like a Buisness. And I don’t like that mindset, but it feels at times like it is. Like I’ve said this many times in the past. That why is it so hard to get a yes. I’m not trying to be forceful am asking about myself. Like I feel like just asking out a girl. Just to meet up for drinks or for coffee. Is like the hardest thing in the world. Like I feel like I don’t know if it’s the majority of woman. And I’m not trying to blame them. But I feel like them just getting to want to hang out even as a friends thing. it’s like in their eyes. They feel the same way and employee feel when they’re talking to a job applicant. or the way police do when their interviewing a suspect in a crime like. I feel like every little thing you bring up could make them go from being interested to not less than a couple minutes. Like every little thing is watched very very closely. Like I feel like little things like I stumble on a word, I lose eye contact, or I lose my focus like we could have virtually all the same interests all the same hobbies, but just it feels like that one little thing will destroy it. Like the thing I’m asking is like how can I get the girl in the mood enough or she would feel comfortable to saying yes. And I’m not even talking about just romantic things I’m talking about just hangouts or something that might just be a one time gig.

And I’ve tried everything even dating apps when I use them I get like three or four likes when most people by the end of the week will get like 20 likes. And the type of girls that like me are either unattractive or they live in another state or 300 miles away. And all the women I know the majority of them all have boyfriends that’s another thing that I want to know is. I don’t know this personally for a statistic. I live in San Diego California in the Vista area. but I kind of wonder in my geographical location like if someone were to run a statistic men outnumber women in the overall population. Is that why it’s harder to find single women. Like 70% of them of all the women that I know they either tell me they have a boyfriend or I see they do on their social media feeds. 

For about five years, I had this real anger toward women. I never told them particularly about it, especially women that I was friends with or knew friends. But I would tell my guy friends how I’m sick of the constant rejection and and I was tired of feeling like trying to get a girl to go out with you. I feel like I said it shouldn’t be like trying to get a job at a Wall Street bank. Like back in 2019 in 2020 I asked out like probably 50 women both those years and almost every single one of them were rejections. and that’s when my feelings about dating and about the world just started to Harden. I felt entitled I felt that women owed me something and I felt like I shouldn’t have to do anything to change. They should just put up with it. and now I know that was not a healthy feeling to have. I was just tired of the constant rejection and the constant getting turned down. It wasn’t any of the girls fault. My deep down anger was really at myself because I felt pity and self loathing and just I hated myself. But now I’ve become more self-aware. I’ve abandoned that feeling because I knew it wasn’t healthy. I’ve started trying to own up to my own problems. Now the question I ask is what can I do? Sometimes I do have feelings and questions about like why does it have to be this way but I’m not like somebody who’s constantly angry or trying to pin the blame on women or society as a whole anymore like I was for a long time. 

I feel there has been some improvement last week. I went to this girls birthday party. She just turned 29. A couple months before that back in October these two sisters, who are both in their 30s one of them as a bartender at a bar I go to regularly. They both have boyfriends, but I went to a rock concert at this bar in Oceanside on Halloween night. It was a black Sabbath cover band. So I would say there has been some progress, but I feel like it’s not even remotely close to where I want it to be. The last girlfriend I had was about a year ago and we dated for about 7 months. It was the longest girlfriend I ever had. She was five years old than me. I was 26. She was 32. But before her, the last girlfriend I had was in high school my senior year. I was 17 and she was 17 we dated for about three months. I’ve only had two serious girlfriends, and I’ve only been out like on three dates in my life. so that’s pretty much five women I’ve gone out with. ",1,1769119827.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1qk8eym,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qk8eym,"At a loss, looking for advice! Please be nice","31f soon to be 32, struggling immensely with the state of my face. This can't be normal right?? I see so many posts here of ladies over 5 years older then me that look younger then me. 

Concerns: 
Thin/loose skin. Crinkling when I smile is not a good look
Fine lines
Crepey eyelids
Eye bags/large pores (mostly genetic but would like to soften even a little bit) 
Some persistent redness from rosacea 

I quit smoking a year ago, I dont drink alcohol and I eat healthy every day. I am active, I drink ALOT of water sometimes with electrolytes, and have cut back on coffee immensely. 
I have tried numerous eye creams that don't seem to help much or hydrate. I've tried castor oil, different moisturizers and serums. 
I also take antihistamines seasonal for allergies. I take supplements and have tried collagen powder. I feel like my face is aging incredibly prematurely for how healthy I have made my lifestyle. My skin wasn't this bad when I was smoking! Yes, I know that does damage but damn I should be looking better then before! My hormones fluctuate pretty drastically and am thinking this is also contributing, especially with loss of volume. 

AM routine: 
wash with only water 
Eye cream (sampling with Peter Thomas Roth last couple days) 
Peptide cream (had improvment with Clinique for months and suddenly stopped helping)
Moisturizer (Cosrx ceramide skin barrier) 
Spf 30 (Andalou tinted with vitamin c) 
PM: 
Cleanse with Cerave hydrating cleanser, couple times a week will use Cerave SA instead
Repeat same products, minus the spf Sometimes will add squalane last. 

I'm scared to try actives because of having very sensitive skin and don't know if I can tolerate potentially looking worse than this.

I see alot of comments on this sub saying, ""you just look dehydrated, drink more water! Moisturize!"" Trust me people, I have upped my water and moisturizer and it's not helping. Are lasers my only option? I dont need to be perfect, but at least would like to look my age instead of passing for 36.

1qk8erl,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1qk8erl/struggling_to_navigate_grief_while_pregnant_how/,Struggling to navigate grief while pregnant — how do you hold joy and loss at the same time?,"I’m a 20-year-old woman, currently pregnant, and I’m having a hard time navigating grief while trying to prepare for motherhood.

For some background: I found out I was pregnant in mid-2025. The pregnancy was unplanned, but I was genuinely excited. I’ve always wanted to be a mom. At the time, my life felt stable and predictable, which is very important to me. I’m very routine-based and thrive on structure.

I was in school full-time, two semesters away from finishing my associate’s degree. I worked part-time, had money saved (I’ve been working since I was 16), and felt financially secure. My boyfriend and I were doing okay—he was making good money—and things felt manageable. Once I found out I was pregnant, I decided to take a full-time job to build more savings and prepare for our future. I worked four 10-hour shifts a week and had weekends off. I loved that schedule.

Around the time I started this job, my grandfather’s health began to decline rapidly.

I lived with my family, and I was usually the first one awake in the mornings. My grandfather used to wake up around the same time as me, but I noticed he started sleeping in later—or not getting up at all. Every morning, I would wake him up, make his coffee and breakfast, sit with him, and ask how he was feeling. He always told me he was okay, just tired.

I’d go to work, come home on my lunch break to make him lunch, return to work, then come back late at night to check on him, make sure he was settled, finish my homework, and go to sleep. That became my routine.

Eventually, he started falling just from getting up to use the bathroom. I developed a deep fear that he would fall in the middle of the night and I wouldn’t be there to help him. That fear was rooted in trauma—my grandmother had passed away years earlier after falling alone at night.

For about a year before my grandfather passed, I had recurring dreams about him dying in different ways. I’d wake up anxious and check on him multiple times a night just to make sure he was alive and breathing.

As his health worsened, others noticed too. He became malnourished, thin, and sick-looking. He would get up at night confused and delirious. I convinced myself it was just exhaustion. Looking back, I realize I was in denial, and I still struggle with guilt over that.

One day while I was at work, my mom called and told me they were taking him to the hospital. He had fallen and was found asleep in the front yard, leaned over our plants. It felt like my worst fears were coming true.

He stayed in the hospital for weeks and was transferred between facilities. I felt guilty for not visiting more—between work and the hospital being hours away, it wasn’t always possible. I did call him every night, though. Some nights he was coherent; other nights he wasn’t.

I leaned heavily on my boyfriend during this time. Every day felt like I was carrying a pit in my stomach. I knew what the outcome would be—I just wasn’t ready for it to happen so soon.

Eventually, hospice was brought up. Hearing that my grandfather—who had always been strong and independent—would need 24/7 care and be sent home on comfort care broke me. The stress became overwhelming. I failed my classes that term and lost my financial aid, which only added to the feeling that everything in my life was unraveling at once.

Then one night, the hospital called to tell me my grandfather had fallen again and broken his hip. He needed surgery the next morning. I spoke to him on the phone that night, told him I loved him, that I’d be there in the morning, and that everything would be okay. I didn’t know that would be our last conversation.

When my mom, sister, and I arrived the next morning, my heart dropped. He looked so much more frail than when I’d last seen him. The doctor told us he hadn’t been conscious all morning and likely wouldn’t be again. He was having secretions and needed constant suctioning to prevent aspiration.

The doctor asked if we wanted to proceed with surgery. My sister and I said no. Deep down, I felt that if he went into surgery, he wouldn’t come out. I knew I needed to stay with him.

He passed later that day.

I didn’t leave his side. I held his hand, talked to him, reminisced, thanked him for everything. My boyfriend came to support me—we had been together for 5–6 years, and my grandfather loved him. In many ways, my grandfather was the father figure I never had.

His death shattered me, but there was also a strange sense of relief. I wasn’t living in constant fear anymore of him passing in a traumatic way. I don’t know if that sounds awful, but it’s the truth.

After his death, my parents began fighting constantly, which was extremely stressful during pregnancy. My boyfriend suggested we get our own place. I was hesitant—leaving my home, my mom, and my younger sister was hard—but after my grandfather passed, it felt like another chapter had already closed.

We moved out. I had my dog, who became my emotional anchor. Between my dog and my boyfriend, I slowly started feeling okay again. Our apartment felt like home. My boyfriend was supportive, caring, and present. I thought things were finally looking up.

Then one day, while driving home from work, I called my boyfriend like I always do. He didn’t answer right away. When he finally did, he told me he was so sorry—he had taken my dog out, and she slipped away while he was picking up after her.

My heart dropped.

My mom and sister came immediately, and we searched the neighborhood. When my mom called me back, I heard crying in the background. I already knew. She told me someone had found her—but she wasn’t okay.

She was gone.

I’m very religious, and in that moment, I questioned God. I was angry—at myself, at my boyfriend, at God. I had prayed, begged not to lose anything else. But I was also exhausted. I didn’t even have the energy to stay angry. I just felt defeated.

In the weeks that followed, I felt numb. Dissociated. Like I was watching my life happen from the outside. Some days I felt okay; others I didn’t recognize myself.

Now my baby is due soon. People keep asking if I’m excited. And I am—I love seeing the nursery, imagining my baby—but the grief seems to consume every happy moment.

So I’m asking:

If you’ve experienced grief while expecting something joyful, how did you cope?

How do you make space for excitement when loss feels so overwhelming?",1,1769119725.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False
1qk8em4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qk8em4/aitah_for_for_arguing_with_my_mil_over_the_style/,AITAH for for arguing with my MIL over the style of my wedding dress?,"Sorry for any formatting issues, I am extremely frustrated, slightly tipsy and typing this on mobile.

I (25f) and my Fiancé (34m) grew up together; he was my brother’s closest friend from kindergarten and we’ve had a whirlwind romance after I graduated from college and moved back to my home state. 

We’ve been engaged for just over a year now, generally there has been no glaring issues in this relationship, however the wedding planning has taken it’s toll on us. His mom (54F) raised him by herself, I’ve always known about the close relationship between them, but growing up I’d only met her a handful of times. My older brother (33M) used to prefer their hangouts happening at our home as she could be very overbearing. 

I didn’t believe him at first as she did have him quite young, from what he’s told me she dropped out of her dream school to have him and raise him so it would be understandable for her to be protective, however, I have noticed her crossing some boundaries in regards to my choices regarding my own wedding. For example, I have always wanted a pastel spring wedding, but she insisted that we need to get married in the fall. At first it was just little suggestions here and there that we both ignored, but she had escalated and is now trying to dictate every aspect of the day that we tell her about. 

Today was the day I was purchasing my wedding dress, she phoned me on my way to the bridal store asking what day “our dress fitting” was on and proceeded to shout over the phone about how I “never told her the correct date” and that she “had it marked in her calendar for next month”. Despite being hurt that she was trying to make a big moment for me all about herself yet again, I extended an invite for her to join us at the store as it was only a 15 minute drive from her home.

She showed up after I’d already chosen my dress. I absolutely fell in love with this big princess style gown, it’s dramatic but somehow classy with a trail and matching veil and it makes me feel like the queen I have wanted to be on my wedding day since I was a young girl. 

She walked in, coffee in hand and proceeded to ask when I was going to take her suggestions for my dress into account. I told her that this was the dress I had chosen, I’d fallen in love with it and was just waiting for her to arrive to see it and make the payment, as she said that she was going to be paying for my dress as she cannot contribute to any other part of our special day. She told me that SHE wanted to be the one to pick my dress, as my future husband (her “baby boy”) would think that this is hideous and frumpy and that I needed to remember that it’s not just my wedding day, but also his. 

I told her that he has no say in what I choose to wear  to our wedding, I am not dictating the type of tux he wears as long as it follows our chosen color scheme. She told me that as she was paying, I had to buy the dress she chose. I decided to humour her and she picked the most “cheugy” mermaid style dress I had ever seen, I don’t think this style looks truly awful on most people, however I am not blessed in the chest enough to pull this off.

I reached my breaking point when she said that SHE had always wanted a mermaid style dress for her wedding but never met the right man for her. My cousin (26f), who is also my maid of honor, has been sick of MIL’s behaviour for a while and couldn’t help herself from making a comment about how it almost seemed like she wanted to be the one marrying her son, we’d had a few glasses of prosecco that morning to set the mood for a good day out so this comment did not surprise me. 

I agreed and said that it almost seemed like she was planning the wedding for herself without me and my fiancé in mind, I wasn’t her dress up doll and i’m not willing to go along with this for the rest of my life. My mom (60F) prefers to try keep the peace in stressful situations, so she told me to hear MIL out and see if we could come to a compromise over the dress. I decided that I was having my dream dress and paid for it myself to stop any bickering. 

MIL is now refusing to come to our wedding unless I return the dress and wear one that she has chosen. My fiancé sympathises with her, he knows how much she has sacrificed to raise him and feels truly upset about her refusing to attend her only sons wedding over something as simple as a dress, however I am absolutely refusing to back down on this when she has tried to meddle in so many aspects of our special day already.

I would truly appreciate any advice, I took this week off of work to deal with finalising some planning details for the wedding (I work from home so it’s not really the biggest deal with my employer if I need time off as i can make it up later). I have had a few more glasses of wine at my cousins place so I may not check this app until tomorrow.",6,1769119714.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False
1qk8dvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1qk8dvn/questions_for_those_who_experience_the_crash_on/,Questions for those who experience the ‘crash’ on methylphenidate,"Hello fellow ADHD’ers 

I’m looking for a bit of advice and help. Been on 54mg methylphenidate for a month after titrating up. The come down at the end of the day is really tough for me. I experience fantastic effects throughout the day, it makes me feel like the person I want to be, feeling present, put-together much more functional, less anxious, I could lay a laundry list out!

I approached with my prescriber (UK) adding in a small IR of methylphenidate in the afternoon/eve and they said this wasn’t routine and they wouldn’t explore this option as it would put me over the typical dosage limit for xaggatin. Told to just recognise and deal with it on my own, or stop the medication. know from lurking on this sub that it is more common to be prescribed this. Is this something that’s available later down the line?? 

I’ve also read that L tyrosine can be a good supplement to help with the crash symptoms. Are there any other supplements you’ve found have been very helpful? 

I eat well, sleep well, exercise lots, BP and Heart rate are great, drink lots of water, no coffee, no tea. I feel like I’m doing everything I can but the crash at 4pm really is annoying and making working late evenings awful. I do not want to go back to living my much crappier, unproductive, and anxious exec dysfunctional existence without meds. 

Thank you for your help and reading this through, just feeling a bit dispirited with being told a hard no on that prescription front when I feel I could probably really benefit from it. 

In a nutshell:

Very positive effects from meds, but 4pm crash is hard. 

Recommendations for supplements? 

Tips on managing crash?

1qk8c62,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1qk8c62/my_dad_has_terminal_cancer_my_boss_confronted_me/,"My dad has terminal cancer... My boss confronted me saying he “would never burden my kids like that"" after a work from home request.","My (25) dad (56) has terminal cancer. Maybe a year left to live. He was diagnosed in 2024 with a 6-12 month life expectancy, so over all I do feel grateful. 

After working remotely for a few weeks over the Christmas break, I felt a weight lifted off my chest that I hadn't felt in a while. Being home meant I got to have breakfast and lunch with my parents, maybe even sneak in an episode of our show over lunch. This also meant I could give my mom peace of mind when she steps out to the store or for coffee... It just felt good to not be so disconnected from them for once.

After realizing the peace this gave me, I had decided to touch base with my boss about the potential to extend working from home a few days a week. I work at a small family run company, ! have a pretty basic administrative job, l am very often the only one at the office (not customer facing), and it's the middle of winter here. But his reaction and words have left such a heavy impact on my mind, I don't know what to do.

When I mentioned the desire to work from home a couple days a week during this winter season, I wouldn't say he hesitated, but he got defensive “for me”? He started asking what was wrong, and why we aren't hiring at-home help. I expressed that although my dad is having a hard time talking now, for the most part is physically able and good.

But that's when he crossed over a line I don't know if I can come back from... After stating I am looking out for my own mental health, he immediately went into projection mode and started telling me ""You need to live your life, you shouldn't be trapped there""... ""If this was \*his wife's name\* and I, I would never demand any of this from my kids. You aren’t their personal caregiver"".... and finally; ""I would never burden my kids like your parents are to you.” 

I just started bawling.

Unable to speak or confront the topic at this point, he ended the conversation by saying that he thinks coming to the office is better for my health than working remote. That he thinks me being at home is too much of a toxic and demanding space. All personal opinion, no mention of how this affects or changes my work, because to that I would say it doesn't, I am way more productive and focused at home.

Since this convo, I’ve been extremely distant at work. I’ve been staying home often, even without permission. At this point, I don’t know how to come back from this. I loved my job, coworkers, and career, but now the word “burden” is stuck in my head and I can’t shake it.

Family context: I have a father (63) and mother (53) who live together about 2.5 hrs away (by car), and a little brother (23) who lives about an hour away (by public transit).

I'm sorry this is going to be quite long but I just need to vent... 

  
I have always had a complicated relationship with my mother. She was physically abusive with me from the ages 6 to 13 and the emotional abuse has continued but lessened after I moved out at 19. My brother ""John"" was not abused as he was the golden child, and even directly contributed to my abuse (he would hit himself and fall to the ground near me so that my mom would punish me for allegedly hitting him). Both my father and mother exhibit signs of narcissism and my brother and I are the textbook example of a golden child and scapegoat (me). I have been trying to move on from the trauma from the physical abuse after my BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) diagnosis and only really found out that what I experienced was abuse when I went to therapy in my early 20's. I have always thought of going low to no contact with my mother but something happened during my visit for Christmas that made me really consider it. This was the first Christmas in the almost 6 years that I have been with my boyfriend (31m) ""Brian"" where my parents invited him to join. I have always dreaded every time I had to visit but endured it for the sake of the family dog who is getting quite a bit old now. Despite my concerns, Christmas went amazingly while Brian was there. The plan was for him to get picked up by his dad as his grandparents lived close-ish to my parents and I would get driven home with John about an hour later by my mother. Everything collapsed when Brian left. My dad had been asking John to help him with a work related document during the 3 nights we were there but every day John would say he would help tomorrow. Fast forward to the hour before we were supposed to get driven home, when my dad asked again for help, John said that he would rather do it when he gets home and send it to my dad later. My dad exploded at this (which he shouldn't have) and started yelling for us to all load our bags in the car because we're leaving immediately. I tried to diffuse the situation and asked if I could go brush my teeth and reminded my dad that I still need to put my cats in their carriers (I brought my cats with me as I didn't have a cat sitter). When I got back from brushing my teeth, I found my mother yelling at my dad and saying things like ""what's wrong with you"" ""John didn't do anything wrong"" ""why are you always like this"" etc. and just completely escalating the situation. While I disagreed with my dad exploding like that, I can understand what led him to do so. My dad had broken his arm and needed help with a lot of things. My brother has a tendency to just sit on his phone all day and he also has a habit of bullying my dad imo. He would do things like sit on the only couch that my dad was able to lie down on and ignore him when he would ask him to move, put his bare feet on the coffee table in front of my dad's face, make fun of him when he would try to joke around, and just overall had a bad attitude. So I think that refusing to help my dad with the work thing was the last straw after my dad had been patient with him. In the past John has also made my dad drive 3 hrs to drop off a suit for an interview, just to make plans with his gf despite knowing when my parents were coming, and making my parents hand him the suit in a mall parking lot. I can't deny that my dad was being a handful during this time, but mostly to my mom. He would demand that my mom tuck him in with blankets on the couch every time he would get back from a smoke, demand that my mom help him with his jacket every time he would go for a smoke (which was A LOT), say things like ""get me a water"" or ""make me a coffee woman"" intending it to be a joke but it just wasn't funny and was too frequent. EVERY TIME he would do this though, I would defend my mom and do the task he asked for instead while the golden child just sat on his ass scrolling through tiktok. Anyways, when I came down and saw my mom escalating the already tense situation, I got mad at her and told her to stop because it wasn't helping. I started suggesting that I help my dad instead (he didn't want me to) and I then turned to my brother and asked why he couldn't just help him. That got my brother really mad and he yelled at me saying ""Stay out of it. There you go just assuming things"". I saw red and I told him that I was sick of his attitude and his complaining to which he groaned and said that I was one to talk (not sure what he thinks I was complaining about during the visit when I was just being helpful and having fun until then). I flipped out and said things I shouldn't have, and told him that I hated him and never want to speak to him again. My mom ""hugged"" me during this which felt more like she was restraining me and shushed me while repeating in my ear ""John didn't do anything wrong"" over and over again. She dragged me upstairs to ""talk"" but then while I was basically having a panic attack after expressing my hurt to her, she just stared into space and cried, locked herself into the bathroom briefly, then went back downstairs to talk to my brother. I started panicking because yet again I was feeling abandoned by my mom so I shut my eyes and covered my ears. During my panic attack I heard my mom and brother coming in and out of the room to take my things to the car and I know how my brother looks at me when I'm having anxiety. I eventually got into the car and my dad ended up driving despite his broken arm because my mom didn't want to in the snowstorm home. The ride home was tense and took 5 hrs instead of 2.5 hrs due to the storm. At some point I said to my brother that I was sorry for the harsh things I said but that I was not sorry we argued. He then said ""I think we should all be apologizing to mom because she got caught into all of it"" to which my dad said ""why don't you start then"". John said he already did and I didn't speak to anyone but my dad the rest of the ride home. That was Dec 26. I called my mom to check on her a day later (she gaslit me immediately so I said bye), she texted me happy bday in early Jan (I replied thank you) and I haven't replied to her 2 meaningless messages since then, while my brother has texted me here and there and I've replied a little bit but not much. My dad called me on my bday and that's it. 

I saw my mother the other day at my local grocery store with my brother and his gf. I had absolutely no idea that she was going to be in town and I had already paid and they hadn't seen me so Brian and I ran out. My mom rarely visits us and the few times she has (especially without my dad), she has always seen me. I called my dad on the way to the subway station asking what was going on and he claimed that he didn't know that she didn't tell me because he thought that she was here to see me and my brother. My parents haven't officially met John's gf yet so this would've been the first time she was meeting her and she looked happy despite shit talking her a bunch before. While I was talking to my dad crying at the subway station (Brian was with me), my mom suddenly jumped on me from behind to ""surprise"" me. I was obviously crying so she acted confused (as if I was supposed to be overjoyed to have bumped into her in my own city, especially when its far from my brother's area). I told her that I was disappointed that she didn't tell me and that I was going home. My brother was just smiling uncomfortably and I felt bad for his gf. Brian later told me that my mom jumping on me looked more like assault than a hug (it was more of a chokehold) and he was shocked because he has only witnessed her being nice to me despite knowing about my past. I have spoken to my dad and told him about the abuse since then but I don't feel ready to talk to anyone else. I've been riddled with anxiety since and keep having flashbacks of my childhood.

1qk86nx,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1qk86nx/early_career_and_prudential/,Early Career and Prudential,"Not sure how much traction this will get but I’ve been lurking here for a while and have seen others get solid advice. I graduated from a non-target in 2025 and am currently looking for my first job in finance. I’ve had some coffee chats and phone calls for various positions but they haven’t led anywhere substantial.

I’m speaking with someone from Prudential onsite tomorrow and am wondering if it’s a good place to get my foot in the door. The title of the role would be “Financial Advisor”. I would be building a book of clients but it will essentially be a sales role. What separates Prudential from other firms is that they provide you with leads and will sponsor your licenses. It’s also portfolio management/advisory, not peddling life insurance to friends and family (like Northwestern Mutual or NYLI). I actually asked about this specifically over the phone and was assured I wouldn’t be selling insurance policies. The woman I spoke with listed off the first-year performance benchmarks and they seem very attainable for what it’s worth.

With that said, it’s still a commission-based sales role and I’m wondering if I’d be better off doing something else to begin my career. My goal is to do analyst work and I don’t want to get locked into (or out of) anything by taking this as my first job. Would starting as a teller or loan underwriter be more beneficial longterm if I want to transition to corporate finance or FP&A? Should I at the very least get my licenses from Prudential and continue applying to other roles or are the licenses not worth taking the job? If it makes any difference I’m in the midwest and have been looking at jobs in Chicago. Any advice is welcome.",2,1769119206.0,FinancialCareers,1,1.0,False

Did your symptoms sound similar?","Fell down a clients stairs on Dec 8, 2025. As I fell, my right arm at a 90 degree angle became trapped behind my body and elbow hit the stairs on the way down and I felt in in my shoulder. immediately felt pain, tried to continue work after notifying employer and quickly realized I could hardly lift my arm and I certainly couldn't use it to clean. Xrays showed no bone injuries. the first 3-4 weeks were particularly bad. Resting pain, severely limited ROM, shoulder felt loose immediately after fall and began cracking and grinding noises.

PT was thinking neuromuscular inhibition and would ignore when I would try to tell her the exercises we are doing is causing bulging, worsening instability and sharp, pinpoint pain in front of shoulder inside of the joint. fast forward to now - ROM has increased, general pain is gone. However I am stuck with this instability (even reaching towards a cup of coffee for instance causes a gapping and pain sensation in my shoulder joint. If you place your hand on my shoulder you can feel and hear this horrible grinding and popping. I can’t sleep on it or else it feels gapped. when leaning back to wash my hair, if I relax the shoulder and let the arm fall back I am met with a feeling that it will pop right out of the socket and the pain is incredible. The instability isn’t really caused by load/weight but rather seems to be movement itself.

I feel like I can press on the exact spot in the front of my shoulder where I am getting this sharp pain with the instability. I finally got a new PT and she is suggesting labrum tear

here is her initial report findings from Monday Jan 19, 2026:

”R**OM and biomechanical analysis**  
Shoulder ROM: flexion 120°, extension WNL, abduction 80° (passively 110°), external rotation 30°, HBB to bum.

Shoulder strength: 4+/5

**Neurological**

**Special tests or other**  
Shoulder special tests: O’Brien’s test palm up more painful than palm down; apprehension test positive.  
Capsule stretch: unable to fully test due to anterior capsule pain.  
Labral testing positive.”

1qk84d7,https://www.reddit.com/r/NinjaLuxeCafe/comments/1qk84d7/ninja_luxe_es601eu_extremely_inconsistent/,Ninja Luxe ES601EU – Extremely inconsistent espresso extraction with identical settings,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to ask if anyone else is experiencing serious issues with the Ninja Luxe ES601EU, especially regarding espresso extraction consistency.

Here’s my setup and workflow:

	•	Machine: Ninja Luxe ES601EU

	•	Shot type: Double espresso

	•	Target: 18 g in / \~36 g out in \~25 seconds

	•	Beans: always the same beans from a local roastery (also tested other beans)

	•	Grind size (machine recommendation): Level 1

	•	Portafilter: double-shot basket

	•	Tools: coffee scale, WDT tool, puck screen

The problem:

The machine is wildly inconsistent, even though everything is kept identical.

	•	The built-in grinder is not reproducible at all

→ sometimes 16 g, sometimes 17.x g, sometimes 19 g

→ I manually adjust every single shot to exactly 18 g

	•	Extraction is basically a gamble:

	•	one shot produces 90 ml

	•	the next only 15 ml

	•	another gives 60 ml in 15 seconds

	•	all with the same beans, same grind size, same workflow

What really doesn’t make sense:

After an extremely fast extraction (e.g. 60 ml in 15 seconds), the machine tells me to adjust the grind size from level 1 to level 5, which is the complete opposite of what would make sense physically.

Things I’ve tested:

	•	with and without WDT

	•	with and without puck screen

	•	different beans

	•	identical dose, tamping, basket, and shot type

➡️ Result: massive shot-to-shot variation remains.

At this point it feels like the machine has either:

	•	unstable brew pressure regulation

	•	unreliable flow measurement

	•	or a fundamentally flawed internal algorithm / sensor logic

So my questions:

	•	Has anyone else experienced this with the Ninja Luxe?

Kitty-corner from me sat Tom, one of our PMs. He was listening to his voicemail out loud. The current message was from someone who was irate he called Tom an asshole and a few other sharp names and was yelling; I could imagine spittle coming out of the corner of his mouth.

I could hear everything clearly from my cube. Tom hung up his voicemail and returned the call. His first words were ""Who is your manager"". The person on the other end provided the name and Tom replied, ""Hold on I'm going to conference him in"". I heard Tom push the buttons and lean back in his chair.

He started out ""Let me Introduce myself I'm Tom LastName and I work for company"". He continued, hardly pausing for breath: ""The same person that signs my check signs your check"". ""You called me and raised your voice and left profanities"". ""I get paid a lot of money to put up with shit from clients, however I should not have to put up with it from fellow employees"". ""The next time you call me you will be nice."" ""You will say please and thank you and you will not raise your voice at me"". ""Have I made myself perfectly clear"". ""Ya'll have a nice day"". Then he hung up.

I overheard this call more than 30 years ago and I can still quote it pretty much verbatim. I think it's a lesson we should all remember as we go about our workday.",15,1769118994.0,overheard,0,1.0,False

1qk80ui,https://www.reddit.com/r/Strongerman/comments/1qk80ui/the_awful_habit_that_makes_you_uglier_and_no_its/,The awful habit that makes you uglier and no it's not what you think,"Lately, it feels like everyone is obsessed with appearance upgrades—skincare, jawline mewing, lighting tricks on TikTok. But here's the uncomfortable truth most influencers avoid saying out loud: one of the ugliest traits isn’t physical—it’s *behavioral*. And yes, science backs this up.

The real silent killer of attractiveness? **poor sleep**. Not just from the beauty angle, but from how it wrecks your mood, energy, social appeal, and even face. You can’t fake vitality when you haven’t slept properly in weeks. And yet, people brag about ""team no sleep"" like it's a flex.

Andrew Huberman, a Stanford neuroscientist, has hammered this point constantly. In his podcast *Huberman Lab*, he explains how missing sleep doesn’t just lead to puffy eyes. It lowers testosterone in men, disrupts skin barrier function, messes with growth hormone and collagen production, and kills your baseline motivation. People with chronic sleep debt literally *look* more tired, emotionally unstable, and less charismatic. That’s not just opinion—it’s biology.

Even worse, a 2017 study published in *Royal Society Open Science* found that people who were sleep-deprived were rated as significantly *less attractive* and *less socially appealing* by strangers. The lead researcher, Tina Sundelin, described how people instinctively avoid sleep-deprived individuals because they subconsciously appear less healthy. That’s some primal-level rejection built into our responses.

Other highlights:

* **Matthew Walker**, author of *Why We Sleep*, shows how sleep affects facial symmetry, inflammation, and even eye brightness. Just reducing sleep by 2 hours a night can make your face look visibly duller within days.
* A 2022 study in *Nature Aging* revealed that chronic poor sleep accelerates skin aging and reduces recovery from UV exposure by impairing DNA repair in cells. If you think sunscreen is enough, think again.
* **Dr. Daniel Lieberman** from Harvard also noted how proper sleep not only increases metabolic health but plays a role in facial composition by regulating fat retention around the jawline and cheeks.

So yeah sleep isn’t just rest, it’s *free cosmetic surgery*. But no serum replaces your REM cycle.

Here’s how to not sabotage your face:

* **Go to bed at the same time every day.** Stop pulling all-nighters, even on weekends.
* **Cut screen time 1 hour before bed.** Blue light suppresses melatonin more than you think.
* **Get morning sunlight.** Huberman calls it nature’s coffee resets your circadian rhythm.
* **Caffeine cut-off by 2 p.m.** Dopamine and sleep hormones don’t like competing chemicals.
* **Don’t eat right before sleeping.** Digesting food late spikes your body temp and delays deep sleep.

Looks aren’t everything. But if you’re spending money on aesthetics, yet ignoring how awful sleep makes you look and feel, you’re not playing the long game.

1qk7zjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/1qk7zjc/my_partner_32m_has_a_coworker_who_acts/,"My Partner (32M) has a coworker who acts inappropriately and even after I (28F) have asked him to set boundaries with her, he just won't do it.","I (28F) and my partner (32M) have been together for 4 years, lived together for 2. We have two cats, close with each others families, talked about marriage, babies the whole 9 yards. His family suffered a very tragic accident that left a very close family member of his forever altered and to spend the rest of their lives in the hospital. I've helped in through that and been there for it all (Important later). My partner started a new job in December 2023 (1.5 years after we started dating) He started becoming close with a group of his coworkers which I was happy about. His friend group had all moved away during COVID and I know he was feeling isolated and yearning for friendships. The new coworker/friend group consists of 3 males and 2 females. All of them have long term relationships and most live with their partners. I am not a jealous person, I have plenty of male friends and I trust my partner so I think nothing of the fact that they are going out as a group drinking and staying out late. That is, until one night after coming home from being out with this group, its 3am and he has fallen asleep on the couch. His phone is buzzing from texts which is odd because its 3am. I pick up his phone and see multiple texts from his coworker ""D"". She has texted him multiple times about how great of a time she had and he ""better get home safe"" and then she sent her location and requested his. Which he accepted and shared with her. She then asked him if I was home waiting for him. This is my first red flag. Why is this girl requesting my partners location and sending hers. This is a huge boundary crossed and to me, highly inappropriate. I don't want to start anything so I don't bring it up, then I become paranoid so I'm checking his messages more frequently. I come to find next time I peak, that he deleted that text thread. Highly sus.

Over the next few months, shes texting him late at night asking for pictures of our cats. Specifically HIS cat (the cat he had before we moved in together) and slagging off MY cat. He also deletes these messages. She's replying to his instagram stories, one of him shirtless in a pool on our vacation that I took of him, one of him at Christmas that I took of him...calling him a ""baddie"". When I am around she screams and hugs me and is over the top fake nice to my face. However she is also grabbing his bicep in front of me, saying hes husband material..all of this icky stuff that no girlfriend wants to see/hear from another women about her man.  
The plot then thickens when its their staff party and he comes home and tells me that ""D"" was wasted and being highly inappropriate with every male staff member there. Trying to kiss men who were married and hanging her arms around other guys necks (who have girlfriends). So it is evident this is a trend of hers and I am not over reacting. She does not respect relationships. I sit my partner down and I tell him that I do not like this coworker of his and that she makes me uncomfortable. I said that I don't trust her and I don't want them hanging out, outside of work anymore. He says he understands...but he never sets a boundary with her. Instead he continues like nothing happened. One night I see a text from her...11pm at night shes sending my partner PARAGRAPHS about his family member who is hospitalized. Telling him what him and his family should do, telling him her opinions on the situation, using the names of his family members and siblings that SHE HAS NEVER MET. This hurt me because why is this women involved in this discussion at all? I am his partner, I have been by his AND his families side through this entire situation. I have been there at the hospital, after the hard doctors appointments where he has sobbed into my arms. I've been there on the days hes depressed and can't get up and I KNOW his family. Why has he invited this women who I vocalized I have an issue with, into this part of his life?  
I then confront him again and I tell him I know about the deleted messages and the things hes been keeping from me. At this point we have had multiple fights about this. To the point I tell him that I will leave him if I ever find him hiding things from me again. He claims that nothing is happening and that its just ""awkward for him"" because ""everyone else is friends with her at work"" and he doesn't want to ""cause drama at work"". Funny because he seems to have no problem causing drama at home to prevent this drama from work.  
Every time we talk about this situation I tell him, all I want is for him to set a boundary with her...Tell her the way she acts is inappropriate and disrespectful to our relationship. All I want is for my partner to stand up for me and my feelings. This has been going on for over a year and he still hasnt. On christmas eve this year, she replied to a instagram story I posted of him. She replied ""omg hes so precious tho"". At this point I had enough so I told her exactly how I felt. I replied and told her that I dont like her, I dont like the way she acts around other womens partners, meaning every male staff member at their workplace. I told her shes not a girls girl and please refrain from messaging me again.  
After sending this she did not respond...However a week later she posted a photodump on her instagram and posted/tagged MY PARTNER in a picture. If that isnt the biggest ""f you"" to me then idk what is. It was at this point that my partner acknowledged that her behaviour was deliberate and intended to be a jab at me. I told him he has to say something once and for all. He agreed...However they havent been scheduled together for more than a month. Its been over a month and he STILL has not said a word about it. When I brought it up the other day he said ""I guess I could ask her to get coffee"" which made me want to rip my hair out. WHY WOULD YOU GET COFFEE! This is a conversation, she doesnt get to say her side of it. Its a simple statement that needs to be made on behalf of me and my feelings and OUR relationship.  
I've been going out of my mind, other than this our relationship thrives, were happy. I know that he hasn't cheated and they have never hung out 1 v 1, just as a group. I dont want to break up and lose a cat and my home and this life that I've built. I don't want to start again and I do truly love him. But I feel hurt and betrayed and like he doesn't have my back and I cannot understand why he is more afraid of confronting this coworker than he is of continuing to put this strain on our relationship. Anyway I suppose Im just looking for advice or validation or opinions on what you would do. A 3rd party perspective is appreciated because my friends all hate him for this.

TLDR Summary

4-year relationship, live together, serious future plans. Partner’s coworker “D” has been openly flirty, texts him late at night, shares locations, inserts herself into his family trauma, and trashes boundaries like it’s a hobby. I’ve raised concerns *multiple times* and asked for one simple thing: set a boundary. Instead, he deletes messages, avoids confrontation, and prioritizes “not making work awkward” over my feelings. I finally confronted her myself; she doubled down. He admits her behavior is intentional but *still* hasn’t said anything after a year. Relationship is otherwise solid, but I feel betrayed and unsupported. Am I overreacting or is he choosing cowardice over our relationship?",0,1769118729.0,amiwrong,4,0.5,False

1qk7u5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qk7u5p/theres_an_ocean_in_nebraska_excuse_me/,There’s an ocean in Nebraska? Excuse me?,"I hate the ocean. The whole reason I moved to the midwest was so that I could be as far away from it as possible. Now not only am I smack-dab in the center of an ocean, but an ocean that has never been touched by the light of day.

I treat the ocean like that weird kid in school that barks at people: don’t look at it, don’t talk to it, stay as far away from it as possible, and they’ll leave you alone. But if we’re sticking to the weird kid analogy, none of those rules worked and now the weird kid is in my basement with all of their weird barking friends scratching at the door.

I work from home and when I had enough cash saved up, I moved to the furthest point from any known ocean I could get - Nebraska. Completely land-locked, sitting in the center of the United States with the nearest ocean being around 1500 miles. Rolling plains of nothing but beans and corn and the constant smell of manure from the dairy farms and chicken plants- things that I could ignore as long as I’m away from any extensive bodies of water.

I picked a town within driving distance of a Walmart and said that was good enough. I sold or gave away the majority of my things before moving to the midwest and purchased some cheap furniture from a local thrift store for my apartment. I didn’t need the place to be perfect, just livable with a desk so I can work.

For the first couple weeks, everything was fine. My house was small and I got it for a good deal, so the majority of my time was spent playing video games, furniture shopping, and googling what animal shelters were nearby so I could get a dog or cat to keep me company.

It was until the first major storm of the spring season that things started getting weird. My small house was one of the oldest in the state and had one of those old-fashioned dirt-floor cellars that I was too scared to explore alone. I kept the door to the cellar shut and locked at all times just to be safe; ghosts and demons weren’t things that scared me, but animals with rabies were very much at the top of my list when it came to concerns in this new location. There had been reports of some kid getting bit by a squirrel at the local community college and needed to get a rabies shot because the squirrel was foaming at the mouth. It would later be made known that the squirrel hadn’t had rabies and the foam on its mouth was from a cup of coffee it had stolen from  a college girl. Not funny for the kid that got bit, but very funny to me.

Before it was made public that the local squirrels liked lattes, the town was in a bit of a lock down when it came to wild animals, so I kept my cellar door locked until tornado season hit. The first time I heard the tornado sirens, I wasn’t scared- weather didn’t have malicious intent and if you’re smart you can keep yourself safe indoors. I was a little hesitant when it came to the cellar, but I eventually worked up the courage to unlock the door and head downstairs. A little lightbulb hung from the ceiling at the top of the stairs and it cast a warm glow down the stairwell but didn’t help to see much of the basement itself.

I used my phone as a flashlight to get a better look at the place and it was as creepy as you’d imagine. Rotting wooden shelves lined the walls containing various unknown pickled vegetables from decades before I was born, random taxidermied animals half eaten by moths sat in a pile in the corner, rusty metal parts lay scattered and in plastic bins- your typical 1920s hillbilly basement.

I didn’t want to shut the cellar door, but the wind was getting louder outside and I wasn’t about to be swept away. I’m sure there were plenty of old farmers still outside watching the storm- I had no intention to be one of them inevitably yoinked from their patios. I pulled the heavy wooden door shut.

It was probably ten or so minutes later that the power went out and I lost service. I figured it would happen eventually, but I couldn’t help but be a little nervous. The light in the stairwell was dead, leaving me with nothing but my phone. I had charged my phone prior to the storm, so the battery would last me a good while if I wasn’t playing games on it. As the wind continued to get louder and the sound of hail on the roof began to ping-ping-ping through the house, I felt a strange breeze on the back of my neck.

I instinctively lifted my fist as I spun around to see what it was, but nothing was there and I probably looked like an idiot about to post-up with air. I lived solely on Doordash at this point so I didn’t have any big butcher knives I could’ve brought downstairs with me for protection before the storm, but I could be an absolute freak when it came to potentially dangerous situations- behave weird enough and whatever is coming at you will think you’re crazy and back off.

The breeze continued to blow, but there were no windows or doors that led outside besides the stairwell that went up to the kitchen. The cellar was just a box with dirt walls and a dirt floor. I walked over to the wooden shelves and brushed away some of the ancient dust and cobwebs to see if there was something behind it, but as soon as my hand made contact, the wooden shelf crumbled. I jumped back and the glass jars of pickled things fell to the dirt floor, some of them cracking and others completely breaking open. The smell of 100-year-old pickled eggs and carrots filled the cellar and I had to cover my nose to keep from gagging. I kicked some dirt over the spilled contents in hopes that it would help get rid of some of the smell.

The breeze was stronger, though, so I pushed the rest of the wooden shelf aside, sending the splintering chunk of decaying furniture out of the way. At first it didn’t look any different from the rest of the dirt walls, but I pointed my camera light upwards and saw a thin slit in the wall. I lifted my hand and was able to just reach it- the breeze was coming from there. I ran my fingers along the opening and began to brush away the dirt, feeling more of a gap that trailed down along the wall that had been packed with dirt.

Now, I am a curious person, but my desire not to die outweighs my curiosity. So, I immediately stopped digging the dirt out of the crease when I felt the indent of a small latch. My house used to have a door that slid in and out of the wall with a latch rather than a normal door with a knob or handle- this latch felt the same.

Was I overreacting? Yeah, probably, but I lived alone in a town where I didn’t know anybody. If I went missing or if something were to go wrong, my phone would be my only way of contacting help and the storm had knocked out cell service. I was in no position to take the risk of finding something awful on the other side of this door.

Eventually the tornado sirens stopped and the light in the stairwell flickered back on, but cell service was still nonexistent. When the smell of the pickled vegetables finally died down a bit, I was able to get a good sniff of the breeze and my blood ran cold. It was impossible, but…salt. Sea salt.

I would know that damned smell anywhere, it’s burned into my nose and no amount of cow crap or century-old pickled vegetables could convince me otherwise.

Rather than just leave the wall alone, a primal need filled me with one objective- stop it. Cover it. Get it away. I started packing the dirt back into the wall and filled the slit at the top as well. I could hear the echo of pebbles from the dirt falling through the slit to the other side of the door. It just made me move faster, wedging as much of the dirt that would stay there as possible before picking up my phone, running upstairs, and locking the door behind me.

It doesn’t make sense and I sound insane, but I swear it was sea salt. I grew up on the coast, my father was a scuba instructor- I KNOW that smell. But I literally live as far from any ocean as possible, it was the whole reason I sold all my shit and moved to this crusty old town in the middle of a state where cows outnumber the people 4 to 1. I must be losing it, or maybe there’s carbon monoxide in my house.

The next day, a news broadcast detailed the damages of the tornado that had swept through only a few miles away from my house. Somehow that wasn’t the scariest thing I was concerned about. My mother called to make sure I was alright and I assured her I wasn’t hurt and my home wasn’t damaged. It was a miracle that none of my windows were broken and that the giant oak tree in the front yard hadn’t blown over onto my roof since the surrounding roads were blocked with fallen power lines and cars that had been chucked through the air like a giant baby threw a tantrum.

“In that case, how has it been going? Living in your new place?” She asked me. I didn’t tell her about the door in the basement- she knows about my fear of the ocean and the story behind it, but she never believed it.

“It’s been fine, nothing too crazy…”

We talked for a little while longer before she had to go and I started researching different nearby companies that could check my house for carbon monoxide poisoning or a contaminated water well. Odds are I was hallucinating or something and I wanted to make sure whatever was causing me to smell the ocean in the basement wouldn’t kill me in my sleep. As I was searching online, a recommended story popped up on Google that caught my attention.

‘New Species Found In Ogallala Aquifer’

Shit.

This sent me down a terrifying rabbit hole and I found out that almost the entire state of Nebraska sits above the biggest aquifer on the planet. The aquifer stretches down from Nebraska all the way to the tip of Texas and it says online that it mainly consists of silt, gravel, sand and clay with the deepest point reaching around 1000 feet.

Guess whose house sits directly above the deepest point.

This was a joke. It had to have been a fucking joke. I sold nearly everything I owned and moved to the middle of the United States to get away from large bodies of water and now I’m sitting above the biggest freshwater underground ocean on the planet.

If it was freshwater, though, why was I smelling sea salt?

It gave me a little peace to know I was probably just going crazy. I called the next day for my house to be checked for different things like carbon monoxide, mold, and a possibly contaminated water well. I know that houses within city limits have the same water source, but I wanted everything checked to be safe. I couldn’t afford to move again so I needed to find out what was wrong and get it fixed before the sea salt smell got any stronger.

\*\*\*

The inspector-people came to check out the place a few days later and said confidently that I did not have carbon monoxide, contaminated water, or a gas leak of any sort (but gave me a carbon monoxide detector just to be safe.) This should’ve been great news, right? No. Bad news. Very bad news.

I unlocked the cellar and took each guy downstairs to the fugly old basement. The smell of pickled ick had died down a little after a couple days of being buried in the dirt, but that wasn’t the smell I was concerned about. Out of the four different professionals who went down into that cellar, the only thing any of them could smell was a fart one of them let rip and then tried to play off as a ghost. I wish I was kidding.

What freaked me out most, though, was the fact that the door behind the dirt was gone. The sliding door with the latch. I wanted to see what was on the other side now that I had a couple burly men behind me and odds are I wouldn’t get this kind of opportunity again. So, I started to dig away at the lines in the wall where the door was buried…and kept digging…and kept digging…. The carbon monoxide guy double-checked his readings.

I know my lightbulb isn’t always screwed on the right way, but this is a new level of crazy. The door was there, it had to have been. I knew it couldn’t have just disappeared, but the dirt under my nails said otherwise. The guys told me to just keep the cellar door shut and I would be fine, so I went against my gut-feeling, locked the cellar door, and called it a day.

Things went back to normal after that. Wake up, work at my desk, break, work, lunch, etc. I managed to find a DND group that met up on Fridays and now had a small group of guys I would consider friends. For a few weeks, I had forgotten all about the aquifer beneath my feet and the cellar that smelled like the ocean.

It was about two months after the tornado when I was sitting in our dungeon master’s basement with the guys and Ian, a biology professor at the nearby community college, said, “They finally named that fish they found in the aquifer.”

Damn it.

This began a thirty minute conversation between the biology professor, the geologist, and the avid fisherman of the group.

“Can’t remember what they decided on, I think it was something weird in Latin.”

“That’s a long name for a fish.”

“What?”

“‘Something weird in Latin.’”

“Shut up, Kyle.”

They went back and forth about the logistics of a fish species being able to survive in an aquifer so full of silt and clay for a good while and I eventually started to zone out a bit. I was a bit of a science nerd in school, but these guys were throwing out words that sounded more like Pokemon names to me than actual scientific terms. I was out of my depth- pun intended.

Eventually we started playing and I had a good time with the guys. I didn’t really have friends growing up so I felt lucky to have stumbled upon such a cool group. The majority of the guys were older, married, some even with grandchildren. I was the youngest player of the group and the only female, but sessions were always a hoot and a half and the guys were all in committed relationships so I didn’t have to worry about any of them being creepy towards me.

After a few chaotic hours of battle and terrorizing a fictional colony of ‘sgurfs’- green smurfs, we split the loot we had gathered and started packing up shop. Kyle said he wouldn’t be able to make it next week due to a family situation and I don’t think any of us thought much of it at the time. We all wished him luck and let him know he’d be in our thoughts in prayers- that was about it.

I drove back to my house, carrying my player’s manual and bag of dice when I noticed something…off. It wasn’t alarming, just a strange feeling in my gut. I kept my windows and doors shut and locked at all times and there was no sign of a break-in, so I figured I was just overreacting again. I tossed my manual and bag on the couch and walked to the kitchen to start making a late dinner.

I didn’t have an actual TV channel provider, just a couple streaming services on my PlayStation, YouTube, and a metal pair of antenna plugged into my TV so I could get the local news. Hoping to catch the weather on the 10:00 news, I turned on the “bunny ears” and turned up the volume so I could hear the broadcast from the kitchen. As I was putting my pre-made meal in the microwave, the broadcaster talked about a risk of potential showers this weekend and maybe even a couple flurries here and there, but nothing too crazy.

I grabbed a fork, pealed off the plastic cover, and took my food to the living room before plopping down on the couch in front of the TV. After the weather, there wasn’t really anything interesting. Repairs on the city from the tornado, local high school sports, old lady gets help crossing the street, things like that. What caught my attention was the final story they covered- the new fish in the aquifer.

Pisces qui (kui?) ibinonessedebent, or the “fish that should not be there.” I don’t know if I spelled that right but that was the Latin that the broadcaster butchered. I’m going to call it the ibinone for the sake of simplicity since ‘kui’ is already a fish name I guess. Turns out the little bastard is the ugliest thing on this planet. You know that one guy in your office that’s bowling ball-round, constantly red-faced, sweating, and has his eyes bulging out of their sockets? The ibinone. It’s like the cousin of the Blobfish after it’s been brought up from the bottom of the ocean, except the humanistic qualities like the nose, chin, lips, and forehead are more pronounced. If you lived in a Christian family growing up in the 90s-early 2000s, you might’ve heard of Gaither’s Pond. That might give you a better idea of the appearance of the monstrosity.

At first I thought it was an AI image that someone at the news station fell victim to, but after further research I was able to confirm that it was legit. This sorry bastard was real and made my last boss look like Pedro Pascal.

I couldn’t help it- I laughed. A wave of relief washed over me at the knowledge that this poor mistake of nature was the creature I was freaking out about. I knew I would sleep real good that night and once I was finished with dinner, I threw away the cheap plastic tray, tossed the fork in the sink, brushed my teeth and went to bed.

I was snuggled up cozily in my blankets and nearly asleep when I heard it. A sound, soft, but undeniable.

“…*help…”*

I sat up straight in a single fluid motion like Dracula in his coffin, eyes wide. No. Absolutely not.

“…*help…”*

Nope. Not happening. There was no way in hell I was getting out of bed to address that. My doors and windows were all locked- including the cellar door. No one else was in my home and I was imagining things.

“…”

No…

“…”

Don’t…

“…”

…

“…*help…”*

Fuck.

I grabbed my phone from my nightstand and immediately put my music on shuffle before turning the volume up. If I had trouble sleeping, it was normal for me to play some soothing tunes so I didn’t hesitate to crank that volume up.

***Help- I need somebody- help- not just anybody-***

At this point, sleep was out of the question. I immediately turned my music off, throw my blankets aside, grab a sweatshirt and jeans, and start getting dressed on my way to the front door. Nope. Creepy voice could suck it- I was out of there. I grabbed my car keys from the hook by the door and was gone. The nearest 24-hour gas station was just a couple miles away; I could stay there until I got tired enough that I wouldn’t hear whatever the hell was going on in my home.

I can’t remember how long I sat at that gas station. I pulled up to a parking spot and headed inside to grab something to eat or drink. The good thing about living in this small town is that everyone knows everyone. The cashier at the gas station? Kyle’s cousin. I knew Kyle well enough at this point to know that his family was a good bunch of pun-loving bastards so I had no problem buying four pieces of chocolate cake from the deli, a bottle of Diet Coke, and a shot of Fireball before picking a booth and staying there for a good few hours. While eating, I pulled up Stepbrothers on my phone. Stepbrothers is my go-to movie when I need a distraction or something to calm me down.

“Stepbrothers?” I heard Kyle’s cousin say behind me about half was through the movie. I shrugged, wiping away chocolate cake crumbs from the corner of my mouth.

“Guilty pleasure.” I did not mention the voice coming from my basement, but I did notice the can of Monster and the plate of nachos in his hands.

“Mind if I join you?”

I nodded, giving him the go-ahead, and he slid into the seat opposite of me while I propped my phone against the plastic napkin dispenser for us both to see.

Kyle’s cousin looked almost exactly like Kyle- tall, lanky, pale, a mop of red hair on his head. The only real difference was the age. Kyle was in his late 30s and his cousin appeared to be early 20s. We sat in silence, both of us eating our respective foods while watching the rest of the movie.

“Muh nems Jayk.” I heard him say at one point through a mouthful of nachos. He swallowed and cleared his throat. “Jake. My name’s Jake.”

I told him my name as well and said that I knew his cousin from playing dnd, which made him smile. At this point I had almost completely forgotten about the cries for help at my house. When the movie was over, Jake thanked me for letting him watch the rest of the movie with me and gave me his number. Figured having another friend wouldn’t hurt. Eventually Jake had to keep working and the sun was starting to come up, so I decided it would be safe to return home. I knew I was tired enough that I could fall asleep fast and the sun being up made me feel a little safer- if anything weird happened, the rest of the world would already be awake.

I stepped inside my house hesitantly, ready to bolt if I the voice spoke again, but after waiting for a minute it seemed that the voice gone, at least for now. I said a little prayer just to be safe and climbed back into my bed.

If this was a supernatural threat, I knew I was alone in facing it. All the local churches were very surface-level Christian- bake sales, coffee and pastries after each service, etc. No exorcists or demonologists around here.

Posting on [social media](https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/social-media/), the 41-year-old from [Belfast](https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/belfast/) claimed that Mounjaro, which has been hailed as the ‘King Kong’ of [fat jabs](https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/36728309/lost-weight-mounjaro-loose-skin-surgery-lithuania/), made her “re-evaluate” not only her [lifestyle](https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/real-life/), but also how her brain sees [food](https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/food/).

The [brunette](https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/hair-and-beauty/), who has been injecting since March 2025, posted a clip with the caption “Mounjaro is weird and I love it.”

The [content creator](https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/influencers/), who hasn’t shared her name online, recognised that Mounjaro has “changed her life” – not only has her mood “stabilised,” but she now has “slightly” more energy too.

However, she confirmed the unexpected changes she has noticed since using the [jabs](https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/36782771/mounjaro-lifer-mistake-stopped-injections-weight-gain-hunger/), as she said: “Can we talk about the weird things that Mounjaro does?”[](https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/37834469/mounjaro-lost-weight-skinny-shamed-negativity/)

Firstly, she shared the three cravings she no longer has [whilst on Mounjaro](https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/36788557/mounjaro-loose-skin-second-boobs-legs-wrinkly/), as she confirmed: “I don’t crave vapes, Coca Cola. 

“Coffee tastes weird.”

As well as this, she also added: “Spicy food tastes really spicy.”

Eager to know if others have had similar experiences, the [mother](https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/parenting/), who described herself as a “very different person” after using Mounjaro, begged: “Tell me I’m not alone in this.”[](https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/37980258/windows-drenched-german-luften-trick-wont-drain-energy-bills/)

And it appears that this woman isn’t “alone in this,” as according to [Your Pharmacy](https://yourpharmacy.uk/the-side-effects-of-mounjaro-what-you-need-to-know/), an adequate suppression of appetite and altered taste is a [common side effect](https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/36922411/mounjaro-user-true-extent-hair-loss-side-effect/).

It’s been reported that many [Mounjaro patients](https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/37363325/golden-dose-mounjaro-worst-hangover-mistake/) experience “attenuation in appetite,” which is one of the reasons that it leads to weight loss. 

As well as this, others also noticed an “altered taste in that foods do not seem so appetising or have a different taste.”

Your Pharmacy recognised: “Although this may be helpful in [reducing calorie intake](https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/diet-nutrition-weight-loss/), this can lead to nutritional complications when healthy foods are no longer found appetising.” 

# Mounjaro users react

The woman’s [TikTok](https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok/) clip, which was posted under the username @[ghostiegirl59](https://www.tiktok.com/@ghostiegirl59/video/7593985215488412950), has clearly left many open-mouthed, as it has quickly racked up 32,600 views. 

Other [Mounjaro users](https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/37600931/mounjaro-weight-loss-coming-off-injections-wish-knew/) eagerly raced to the comments to open up on how the injections had affected them.

One person said: “You’re not alone, same era.”

Another added: “I loved garlic but just the smell makes me feel nauseous now.”

A third commented: “Struggling with drinking [coffee](https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coffee/), it’s become so bitter.”

# How to take Mounjaro safely

IF you're thinking of starting Mounjaro, here's everything you need to be aware of to ensure you use it safely.

**Consult your doctor first**

* Discuss your medical history with a GP, especially if you have: thyroid issues, pancreatitis history, gastrointestinal disorders and kidney or liver issues.

**Start a low dose and increase slowly**

* Starting dose is usually 2.5 mg once weekly, injected under the skin.
* Typical progression: 2.5 mg → 5 mg → 7.5 mg → up to 15 mg weekly (in 2.5 mg increments every four weeks, as tolerated).

**Administer it properly**

* Inject once a week, same day each week, with or without food.
* Inject subcutaneously in stomach, thigh, or upper arm and rotate injection sites weekly.

**Watch for side effects**

* Common side effects include: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, decreased appetite and fatigue.
* Seek medical help if you experience any of the following serious side effects: signs of pancreatitis (severe stomach pain), allergic reactions and kidney problems (low urine output, swelling).

To this, the mother wrote back and agreed: “Same, I’m trying to push through. I need coffee in the mornings.” 

Meanwhile, someone else chimed in: “My [teeth](https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/teeth/) feel funny.” 

At the same time, another Mounjaro user wrote: “I’m on day two of 2.5mg, I am a religious drinker of a Pepsi Max can with my tea on a night \[and I’ve\] not craved it once, it’s so weird how it’s totally changed my [body](https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/body-shapes/) and brain!”

In response the content creator replied and shared: “Yes tea tastes awful to me now too. Forgot about that one.” 

As well as this, one [fat jab user](https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/36616256/mounjaro-hell-side-effects-increased-10mg-dose/) acknowledged: “I’m on Wegovy and I can’t drink [wine](https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/wine/) anymore, I’ll have a glass and feel sick, but it’s not a bad thing.”

[](https://www.thesun.co.uk/wellness/37692418/christmas-hangover-cures-work/)

Sharing her experience, the [TikTok](https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok/) creator responded and explained: “I feel drunk after like two sips now.”

That realization pushed me to dig deeper into something that rarely gets discussed outside technical circles:

👉 geospatial intelligence is no longer about maps it’s about decisions.

After reading industry experts, academic research, and national AI strategies, I found five ideas that genuinely changed how I see “location”:

1. It’s no longer about “where something is,” but “what should we do?”

Modern geospatial analysis combines social, environmental, and real-time sensor data to guide decisions — from where to open a new business to how firefighters navigate a smoke-filled building.

2. AI gave location a brain (GeoAI)

This isn’t the same as generative AI.

GeoAI uses machine learning on spatial data to detect hidden patterns and predict outcomes: urban growth, environmental risk, infrastructure stress, and more.

3. Trust and ethics moved to the center

As geospatial AI becomes more powerful, privacy, transparency, fairness, and user control are no longer optional. Some platforms now make generative AI opt-in and explicitly avoid using customer data to train third-party models without consent.

4. An unexpected leader is emerging in Latin America: Colombia 🇨🇴

Colombia isn’t just adopting AI it’s building national frameworks aligned with international standards to govern it responsibly. Many countries are still struggling to do this.

5. The future starts to feel like science fiction (but it’s real)

Quantum computing promises to solve optimization problems that are currently impossible, while AI-driven autonomous systems can analyze entire territories with minimal human intervention.

The key question is no longer “Where is something?”, but

“What would happen if…?” and “What’s the best possible decision?”

If the physical world has become a queryable layer of data…

I am a FTM at 7w+5days now, and have not experienced any morning sickness, or nausea/ food aversion..

The most in terms of symptoms has been sore breasts (but not every day, and my body has already gotten used to it) and then getting teary eyed at random moments each day from very different triggers whether it be through media or music/a show 

Now I have seen and read that yes .. no morning sickness doesn’t ‘always’ mean the pregnancy is not viable/ or a miscarriage is on the horizon.. 

But I also keep seeing that “the more morning sickness the higher&healthier hormone levels are so the less likely a miscarriage will occur” 

part of me is just really worried almost wishing I could experience more of a “healthy pregnancy symptom” 

When I know also ofc I would be in pain and wishing I could have less and what the hell am I even thinking why cant I just be grateful Im so “lucky” to not have any morning sickness

Is there anyone on here that had basically no morning sickness or other “healthier pregnancy symptoms” like I have described that went on to have perfectly healthy pregnancies 

Or is this usually an indication of what is to come (the opposite or complications) 

My first appointment is on the 27th and I have no idea what will happen and i am nervous 

I have been freaking myself out about my caffeine consumption, even though Im a barista and I have been logging my exact grams/specs/measurements per day:

usually 10-15g of coffee grounds to 250g of water pour overs and limiting myself to two of those (8.8oz cups) per day (usually around 200mg of caffeine total maybe up to 250max) 

Then I switched to black tea (4cups at 2g of loose leaf/ 2min steeps with 200-250g water which comes up to about 200mg per day) 

for week 6 because I was so anxious about the coffee….

Now have switched back to coffee due to constipation which Im trying to self soothe and calm myself instead of spending 4 hrs every day reading and researching “effects of caffeine in pregnancy” every single day. . . 

The added knowledge of seeing that most women who have higher levels of morning sickness also have a natural aversion to coffee or tea (which also ties into the lower rates of miscarriages) 

has also doubled my anxiety and guilted me even more at the moment 

The other symptom I had was spotting that started around week 6 which at first I thought could be because of the caffeine daily, but through process of elimination I discovered it was just from sex with my partner 

First I eliminated the caffeine and sex

\-No spotting 

Then went back to coffee but still no sex 

And again

 \-No spotting so I guess Im not worried about that now 😅

Anyways sorry for the long post here but my neurotic side and anxiety has been through the roof in this first trimester

I have two degrees from a top 30 university (not even sure why I'm saying this, clearly this means nothing in this fiery hellscape job market but just for context). I'm trying to land a full-time role in marketing, I have internship and contract work experience on my resume but no full-time since no one will give me any. I'm babysitting to make even a minuscule amount of cash but I'm incredibly burnt out on childcare from leaving teaching and it is soul-sucking. I've paid for countless resume rewrite services, career coaches, online coursework, certifications. I've networked as much as humanly possible, attending in-person and virtual events, reaching out to university alumni connections, asking friends and family for any leads, doing virtual coffee chats one-on-one with people from LinkedIn, and still nothing. I've used AI services like ApplyAll just for the hell of it because I have nothing to lose at this point (except I do have something to lose, which is money, because I'm in thousands of credit card debt due to having blown through my savings months ago). Spoiler alert, those suck too. 

  
I just finally started getting some more traction and had 6 interviews the first week of this month and was feeling really confident and that something might finally work out. Of those 6, one turned out to be a scam (they listed the job as part-time but it was paid hourly and only 5 hours/week and you weren't allowed to pursue ANY outside work), two rejections, and three who haven't responded for a week so those are probably rejections as well. The rejections were with companies with whom I did multiple rounds of interviews and lengthy take-home assignments as well.

I even got desperate and applied to update my teaching license so that I can teach again, but they said I need to wait four months for that to be ready (and in my state you can't even sub without licensure so that's not an option either). Also applied to retail gigs and they all rejected me too. I thought teaching made me the most miserable and depressed I've ever been, but being 6k in credit card debt due to long-term unemployment and having absolutely no prospects is even worse. 

  
I just don't know what to do. I can't afford therapy, I wake up every day even more depressed than the day before, and I show up to my stupid fucking babysitting job a zombie (just to make a whopping $160/week, whoop dee doo). I have no energy to cook or clean or walk my dog and can barely even muster up the energy to continue applying to jobs. It just feels like what's the point when all signs are pointing to absolutely nothing working out for me? I've worked my ass off and groveled and begged for a job in any capacity I know how, and nothing. There is no end in sight for this misery for me and this life just isn't worth living.

Any advice?,"My GF has said she is highly empathetic and often experiences “empathy overload.” She said she feels so much for people and animals that she has trouble with it. I have my doubts. She has 2 outside dogs that she passes by on the daily without giving them any attention. One has obvious hip dysplasia and is increasingly having trouble getting up. It doesn’t seem to bother her. She also has 2 inside dogs that she rarely pets or gives love to. She isn’t very empathetic with me either. For example; I have night time seizures at least 4-5 times a month that affect me. when I tell her I’ve had one it’s as if I’ve told her I just had a cup of coffee. I get no reaction. Last night I was upset because my dog - who is aging and having health issues - wouldn’t lay by me like she normally does. My gf’s response was to laugh. When I’ve gotten upset over my family or my medical condition, etc… she gives no comfort whatsoever. She tells me - and our therapist has given her this idea- is that she feels so much for everything and everyone that she can’t handle it so she shuts down and looks gruff and uninterested.

1qk7p9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/DOR/comments/1qk7p9y/bad_news_today_looking_for_advice_encouragement/,"Bad news today - looking for advice, encouragement, hope...","Hi everyone - I received some bad news today and am looking for encouragement, positive words, advice, anything at all that you think could be helpful.

I was diagnosed with ?DOR when I was 33 - my GYN tested my AMH and while I don't have the number, I remember it being scary low **BUT** I was on birth control a. This prompted me to RUN to REI to freeze my eggs (I was single at the time). Upon retesting my AMH after being off birth control for 4 months, it had come up to 1.32. We did 2 rounds of egg freezing and I got 8 eggs the first round, 6 eggs the second. Not an amazing response, but better than I was expecting based on the initial scans and possible DOR diagnosis.

I'm now 37, AMH 0.32, with a normal FSH and E2 on day 2 of my cycles. Regular periods every 26 days or so. I got engaged in October, and my fiancé and decided to pursue embryo freezing as we prefer to wait until after marriage to try for a baby, but knew we needed to act fast. All of our pre-IVF testing came back normal, and his semen analysis was normal. My AFC has always been about 2-3 at the start of a cycle.

1st round: higher dose antagonist protocol of Clomid 100mg x 5 days, Gonal F 300, Menopur 150. I stimmed for 11 days but unfortunately 2 of the follicles pulled way ahead, and we canceled due to poor response.

2nd round: primed with estrogen patches, then stimmed with Clomid 150mg x 5 days, Gonal F 75, Menopur 75. Stimmed for 11 days and saw 6 follicles on ultrasound on day of trigger (good for me!). 4 eggs retrieved, 4 eggs fertilized...and I got the heartbreaking phone call today from my doctor telling me that 0 made it to blast.

I am feeling so beat down by my collective experience with fertility. During both rounds of egg freezing I was repeatedly told my ""body wasn't responding the way it should"" and I felt like a failure as a woman. This time, when I found out that all 4 of our eggs fertilized, I felt SO hopeful that we would get at least 1 blast. But all 4 didn't make it past the Day 2 cleavage stage. My REI told me that because the egg count was so low, she doesn't feel that she has enough data to say for sure whether this is an egg quality issue or just bad luck.

I have just enough insurance coverage to pursue either 1 more round of embryo freezing (would pay OOP for PGT) ***or*** to thaw my 14 frozen eggs, fertilize, and try for a transfer. My fiancé and I have had some serious conversations and we both agree that we're not ready for a baby until after our wedding in 2027 (for financial reasons mostly, but also we don't feel psychologically there yet). We've never tried to conceive naturally, and my REI keeps telling me that I still have just a good a chance as anyone to get pregnant on my own. But I can't help feeling so defeated based on the outcome of this most recent cycle, and can't see how getting pregnant on my own would be any easier?

When I asked my REI what her advice would be, she told me to consider moving up my timeline for having a child. She believes it would be worth it to try for another embryo freeze round using a different protocol than the previous two, but I'm not convinced. This has been so mentally and physically difficult and I want to take a break, but I feel scared by the ticking clock and getting older, as well as her advice.

I want to add that in preparation for both of these embryo freeze rounds I have: stopped drinking, cut coffee to 1 cup/day, did acupuncture throughout, took prenatals, CoQ10, egg quality support supplements, Vit D.

I'm grieving right now and I know I won't be able to make any decisions about next steps while I'm emotional. But I have no idea whether it's worth it to try again and get actual embryos this year while I'm 37, or wait until next year and see how we do with our thawed eggs/transfer at 38. The reality is we would be willing to put money towards the latter if needed, but I guess I can't fathom jumping into another round right now - to be honest I feel a bit traumatized.

For any of you who've stuck this far - I thank you for reading. I welcome any feedback, but I do ask for positivity as my heart is very tender at the moment. Thank you <3",1,1769118063.0,DOR,2,0.99,False

1qk7lzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qk7lzb/an_early_mourning/,An Early Mourning,"My alarm goes off, snatching me from the dream I already forgot. I reach for my phone to shut it off and almost simultaneously, there’s movement on top of me. The silhouette of my two-year-old cat soon meets my face and releases a string of high pitch meows, undoubtedly demanding breakfast.

“Good morning to you too, Maggie,” I say in between chuckles, “Yeah, let’s get you some food.”

Maggie lets out an excited chirp and promptly leaps off my chest. I hear her scamper off while I swing my legs over the edge of my bed, mentally preparing myself to start the day. I finally heave myself off my bed and walk to the kitchen to feed Maggie. When I flick on the kitchen light, I’m not startled by the bright light thanks to the dimmer my roommate and I chose to install. Considering our schedules, we usually kept it at a low setting. As I open a can of wet food and plop its contents onto one of Maggie’s plates, she purrs and rubs herself against my legs. This was the sort of affection that made a 4am wakeup tolerable. 

“Here you go, little baby,” I softly say as I crouch to place the plate on a mat for Maggie to dig in and she very much does. The air fills solely with the sounds of her eager munching until the coffee machine joins the ambience while I make myself a sandwich. Maggie finishes her meal just as I’m starting mine, then she hops onto the table to nuzzle my arm while I scroll through social media. Once I finish my sandwich, I continue with the rest of my usual routine by getting dressed, brushing my teeth, brushing my hair only to hide it with a hat, and then pouring the coffee into a travel mug. Per usual, I still have fifteen minutes before I need to leave so I sit on the couch to play with Maggie. I watch her continuously leap about as she tries to snag the toy, I goad her with and I can’t help but wonder how she stores so much energy in such a tiny body. We burn through fifteen minutes faster than we’d like and I begrudgingly head to the door. Maggie bats at my laces while I get my shoes on before I scoop her up for one more embrace.

“Goodbye, Maggie, I’ll see you later,” I tell her as if she understands my words, but perhaps she does. I let her down and she scampers off into the darkness of the house. I gather my bag and travel mug and then realize I have to accommodate for a full bag of trash I know I should take now rather than later. With as much finesse as I could hope for, I take the bag of trash with me as I exit the door and lock it behind me. 

The outside air is brisk but I’m grateful for the lack of snowfall. I quickly walk to my garage, opening and closing the door with a swiftness. The enclosed space offers little relief from the outside as my breath is faintly visible. I drop the bag of trash by my car before I place my pack on the back seat and then myself in the driver’s seat. I press the ignition to start and I try to patiently wait a handful of minutes before I turn the heater on. I scroll through my music app to select the tunes for the road and then I remember I’ve got a bag of trash yet to be thrown out. I groan, turn on the heater, and step out of my car to complete the task. I click the fob for my garage door before I close my car door and scoop up the bag of trash. I blankly stare ahead as the garage door takes its time to rise, revealing a dark and lonely alley. I mindlessly look to my left and nearly jump out of my skin.

At the end of the alley stands a person, their form is entirely shrouded with darkness due to the streetlight shining down behind them. From what I can tell, they have shoulder length hair and are about my height. Despite my intrusion, they stay standing there without making any movement or sounds. I decide to not make a weird situation weirder and turn away from them to dump the bag into the dumpster. After doing so, I avert my direct gaze from the motionless person as I walk back to my car. Once inside, I lock the doors twice and exhale deeply as I try to rid myself of my nerves. I'm just about to shift my car into reverse when I look up at my rear-view mirror and feel a heavier wave of fear wash over me than before. Right at the edge of my garage now stands that same person that stood at the end of the alley. Only this time they have their back to me.

Aided by the garage light, I can now tell their hair color to be black and the particular hair style seems familiar. I ease the tension I’ve unknowingly applied onto the wheel and shifter as sweat begins to build on my palms. I then shift into reverse so that I can use the back camera to broaden my view. Doing so reveals the person to be dressed in a white robe and blue pajama bottoms while their feet remain bare. I momentarily rack my brain when familiarity makes me realize this is my neighbor: a single mom of two by the name of Ms. Barrett. Confusion takes the forefront of my mind, but fear is still a close second as I wonder what could be going on with her. 

I should check if she’s okay, I think to myself as I put my car into park. Just as I unlock the doors, the light of my garage flicks off. The added darkness causes fear to creep up, but it shoots up when I check my rear-view mirror and no longer see Ms. Barrett. I then hear the back door on the passenger side open and I turn around to see no one. A sharp tap on my driver’s side window makes me whip my face towards it and there’s no one there either, but the glass is lightly fogged up. The car suddenly shifts and a primitive sixth sense causes goosebumps to erupt all over my body. I don’t even need to look in the rear-view to know she’s in the back seat and almost as a response, her raspy breathing becomes audible. My body is locked in place while my heart threatens to beat through my rib cage. Despite my desperate, internal pleading, I slowly shift my eyes toward the mirror. With the garage door still being open, I’m able to make out the silhouette of Ms. Barrett while her features remain hidden by the darkness. I feel my jaw muscles twitch as I want to verbally confirm that it’s her, because at this point, I feel no different than a child staring into an open closet in the dead of night.

“Where… are… my… children?”

Those first three words come out labored and drawn out in a decent attempt at impersonating Ms. Barrett, but that final word is spoken entirely differently. It’s masculine and I can tell they only have malicious intent. To my greater horror, I watch as the thing in Ms. Barrett’s skin leans towards the mirror. Through the glow of my dashboard and my eyes becoming attuned with the dark, the features on Ms. Barrett’s face become visible, along with the blood that coats the bottom half of her face. Her face is practically parallel to mine when I hear it parts her lips into a grin, confirmed by my peripheral vision. I can’t bring myself to face it, let alone shift my eyes toward it as they remain glued to the mirror. I hear it exhale and a sickly-sweet odor wafts from its mouth, making me clench my teeth so as to not gag. It leans even closer, just shy of pressing Ms. Barrett’s lips against the mirror. While doing so, I get a good look at the eyes and confirm that not only are they not Ms. Barrett’s eyes, but they are also wells of madness. 

“Here they are.”

The masculine voice speaks as this thing has entirely given up on its sick game of deception. It then began to open its mouth hazardously wide; I can hear the tension it’s placing on the ends of its mouth and the hinges of its jaw. At the same time, more of that sickly sweet odor escapes its growing maw. I’m pinned to my seat at the sheer insanity I’m witnessing and it’s only when I hear the sides of its mouth begin to rip that I’m able to snap out of my shock. I fumble the door open, tumbling out onto the garage floor in the process, but the adrenaline helps me roll back onto my feet quickly. I’m now two yards away from my open car door and three yards away from my closed garage door. I take slow steps as I keep my eyes on the mimic in my car, instinctively putting my hands up like a barrier. Suddenly, the sounds of flesh tearing stop. Then I watch my car turn off, followed by my garage door’s slow descent, allowing darkness to engulf my garage. My quickening breathing becomes the only audible sound as I become frozen once again. A moment passes before my breathing is accompanied by the creaking of my car and shuffling of fabric. It takes me a second to piece together that the mimic is crawling over my seat to get out. That’s when I hear my car door slam.

I spin around and bolt for the garage door. Miraculously, I find the knob right away and damn near break the door off its hinges as I ram my shoulder into it. I clear the distance between my garage and my house at athletic speed, crashing into the door as I’m unable to stop in time. I frantically pull out my keys and miss the keyhole twice before unlocking the door and stepping inside. I have the door in hand when I turn around and see the mimic standing in the doorway of my garage, facing away from me. I watch it kick into a backwards sprint and then I slam the door and fasten every lock. I hear no further sounds as I back away until I hear Maggie’s hiss behind me. I turn around and faintly see her silhouette with her fur standing on end with her back arched in anger. 

“Get back, Maggie, we’re gonna be okay,” I tell her as I beckon her away with my hand. A loud thud reverberates from the door, making me whip my head back towards it and silencing Maggie’s hissing. A second one erupts from the door, rattling us and the room alike. As the room grows quiet, I pick up an indiscernible sound coming from the thing outside my door. I approached the door with caution and it was only when my ear was hovering above the door that I could make out the sound.

“Let me in, let me in, let me in,” the mimic rapidly repeats with a gleeful ferocity like a hyena approaching its prey. I stumble away as I frantically try to think about what to do when I hear Maggie let out a frightened yowl. I look back and faintly see her cowering behind the leg of a kitchen chair. The sight of her emboldens me as I then face the door and call out with every ounce of paternal energy within me, “I am not letting you in!”

The mimic’s repetition immediately stops. I take a step forward and demand with venom in my voice, “Leave us alone.”

A moment passes and then the laughing begins. The laughter not only comes from beyond the door, but it seems to come from all around the room. I don’t just hear the mimic’s masculine voice, a chorus of various voices joins in, including Ms. Barrett and her children. The laughter continues to crescendo, becoming unbearable, and then it stops. As if whispering right into my ear, I hear the mimic say, “I don’t need your permission to enter.”

A third, splintering thud erupts from the door and it’s evident the door won’t hold much longer. I run to the block of knives and grab the largest one before taking my place in the center of the kitchen. I grip the handle hard enough that the building sweat won’t make it slip out of my hand. My body shakes all over, it practically tries to make me run away, but I need to stand my ground. After all, what use would there be in running to my room, why would a second locked door make any difference? I have to meet this terror right here, especially to keep my little Maggie safe. I briefly look away from the door to see that Maggie has fled to the living room and at that moment, I hear the door swing open and hit the wall. I return my gaze to the open door, still intact as if I had undone the locks myself. The only sign of contact was a large crevice on the outside of the door. I look beyond the open doorway and spot the mimic in the doorway of my garage again. This time, it’s facing me. 

While the backside of Ms. Barrett’s white robe remained pristine, the front had been desecrated with what I horrifyingly assume to be blood. I observe its hands, fingers hooked like talons, are also coated with blood. My eyes flick up to its face and I’m forced to stifle a scream. The mimic had ripped a Cheshire smile onto its rendition of Ms. Barrett’s face. An equally broad grin gleamed from within despite its teeth being stained with gore. As if I have zero depth perception, I watch the mimic take a single step and suddenly it’s in front of me, just before the threshold of the door. It slightly tilts its head to the side before saying, “Momma, no… please don’t… Mommy!”

It spoke with the voices of Ms. Barrett’s children; it hadn’t replicated their voices perfectly but it was enough to make my eyes water.

Those poor children, I think to myself as I wipe my eyes and a searing anger builds within me. I take a step forward and thrust the kitchen knife, aiming for this thing’s center mass. But the blade never makes contact. It’s as if the space between the tip of the blade and the mimic’s chest stretched just enough to not allow contact. I pull the knife back in utter confusion and the mimic chuckles at me with its masculine voice. It then thrusts its arm forward, striking my chest with its palm, and sending me flying backwards. The knife flies out of my hand and my back collides with the edge of the counter, before I smack onto the floor. The wind is knocked completely out of me; I can’t even look up at the monstrosity invading my home. I listen to its bare feet pat against the tiled floor as it walks towards me.

“Those were poor children, indeed. To think the last thing they saw was their mother lunging at them with a mountain lion’s hunger. The same mother that cared and nurtured them also bit into their flesh and suckled marrow from their broken bones.”

It’s now beside me; through blurry vision I watch it crouch and lean close to me.

“I will do the same with you; I’ll wear your face while I eat that little kitten of yours. Then I’ll wait for your roommate to arrive and tear him apart all the same.”

I hear Maggie hiss again and watch the mimic’s face snap in her direction, giggling before licking its lips.

“You won’t get the same mercy the mother got, I’m going to eat this runt of yours in front of you.”

Before I can protest, it lifts me off the floor with one hand and repositions me so I can now see Maggie. Her ears are pointed downward and despite her fear, she remains coiled in the dining room, standing her ground in her own way.

“Please, don’t,” I beg as I grab onto the mimic’s ankle in a feeble attempt to detain it. I hear it laugh as it easily breaks free of my grasp. Then I watch it raise the same foot and feel it stomp onto my head. The sound my head makes against the tiled floor is sickening and I’m left completely disoriented. I’m unable to do anything as the mimic crouches, takes my left hand, and bites into my index and middle finger. My scream is partially muffled to myself as it thrashes back and forth until it successfully detaches my fingers, leaving bloody stumps in their place. I listen to it chew on my fingers for a couple of moments before swallowing, bones and all. While in close proximity to me, I watch the mimic’s features painfully shift as it attempts to replicate my face. The end result is a perverse amalgamation of Ms. Barrett’s face and my own, but just like before, its true eyes remain in place. 

“This will have to do,” it says with a sneer, before rising and turning away from me. I hear it call to Maggie with a sing-song voice, with my voice, as it strolls towards her. Maggie no longer hisses at the mimic; she becomes wide eyed and frozen as that monstrosity looms over her.

“Please run away, please, Maggie,” I sorrowfully beg while all I can do is watch. Just as the mimic is upon her, her eyes leave it and meet mine.

I push myself off of the floor and tear a path at the mimic. It doesn’t react in time and I tackle the mimic to the floor, causing Maggie to flee to the living room. I waste no time as I take a handful of its hair and smash its face into the hardwood floor.

“Stay the fuck away from my cat,” I growl, repeatedly smashing its face in synchrony with every syllable. I finally drop its head, leaving the mimic motionless on the floor as blood pools from its face. I take a step toward the living room and call for Maggie, but I stop when I hear the mimic’s muffled laughter. I hear it peel its head off the floor, so I turn around to see it looking up at me with a big smile on its tattered face. It shoots its hand out, catching my right leg and pulling it to make me fall onto my back. I don’t falter and launch two solid kicks to its face, freeing my right leg of its grasp. I scramble to my feet, grab a chair, and use it like a battering ram against the mimic. I only get it to the doorway that divides my kitchen and dining room when the mimic completely halts my momentum, snatches the chair out of my hands, and flings it aside. Then it simply steps backwards and around the corner, leaving my sight. 

Panic makes me run after it, but it’s nowhere to be found. I back up into the kitchen and quickly retrieve a steak knife from a drawer. A heart aching yowl from Maggie draws my attention and I see her in the clutches of the mimic. She’s desperately trying to wriggle free and claw at its hand, but that thing has its fingers dug into her scruff and held away from its face. The mimic tilts its head slightly downward as it casts a sinister smile at me. Fear and adrenaline course through my veins as I take off in a sprint at it, but my dining room seems to impossibly stretch on and on. I pump my legs faster, stamp my feet harder, but I just can’t seem to reach them. I watch the mimic use its other hand to grab Maggie by her hind legs, positioning her body in front of its mouth. Then the knife flies out of my hand and plunges into the stomach of the mimic. The knife seems to inflict surprise rather than pain as the mimic simply stops to look down at the protruding handle. I finally close the distance, grab onto its shoulder with my left hand, and retrieve the knife with my right. I then feverishly stab into the mimic and continue throughout its torso. I listen to the mimic’s laughter turn into gurgles as blood escapes its mouth. It clamps a hand on my left forearm, almost stabbing its nails into my skin if it weren’t for my fleece jacket, as it tries to pry my hand off of it. In turn, I grip tighter onto its shoulder and continue my assault. I watch its smile turn into a scowl and feel its fingernails turn into claws as they now stab into my left forearm. It clamps its other hand onto my throat and slams me onto the floor, leaving the knife embedded in its chest. I only have my right hand to try to remove its hand from my throat, but it's evident by the mimic’s strength just how fruitless my attempt is.

“Just who do you think you are,” the mimic snarls as it closes its fingers on my throat, making me struggle for air, “You are a fucking worm compared to me. All of you are so far beneath me! And you are becoming annoying to deal with.”

The mimic squeezes harder and I feel the blood vessels in my face near their limits. As the darkness creeps in from the sides of my vision, a shadow suddenly leaps onto the mimic’s face. Maggie has latched onto its face and started her own assault through bites and scratches. The mimic detaches its claws from my left forearm and stabs them into Maggie’s tiny body. She cries out in pain, she cries out to me, and then she is silent. I watch the mimic toss her aside before licking her blood off its claws with delight. My eyes become locked onto her crumpled form for what feels like eternity and then I black out.

 

I’m stirred awake by someone shaking me and I recognize them to be my roommate, Jordan. There’s panic in his voice and fear in his eyes as he tries to get answers out of me, but I give none. I watch him dial into his phone and back away as he likely gets in touch with a 911 operator. My body feels excruciatingly heavy and the numbness I’ve been feeling has now given way to waves of increasing pain. As I try to observe myself and my surroundings, I realize my right eye isn’t working, I’m covered in more blood than I remember, and I’m holding something in my right hand. I’ve been cradling it against my chest and when I pull it away to see what it is, a deep sorrow strikes my heart. It’s Maggie’s lifeless body. I scream out my sobs and tears cascade from my one good eye. Jordan rushes over to witness the source of my agony and joins my mourning. 

Shortly after I’m taken to a hospital where I’m treated for my injuries and the whole thing passes by in a blur. I wake up the next day and I appear like I returned from a warzone. A nurse tells me they all initially thought I was the victim of a wild animal attack, so when they learned I was the result of a home invasion, the shock had been immeasurable. Later one, I would be visited by a pair of officers, informing me they had already discovered the remains of Ms. Barrett and her children. Based on similarities with a case from a few months ago regarding the murders of a family of four, they linked the two incidents and interpreted the suspect as a serial killer. A week passes by before I learn that the information regarding the linked cases has been leaked to the media and my city becomes abuzz with the possibility of a modern serial killer. Some members of the media are lazy and refer to the suspect as “The Second Dahmer” while others flex their creativity by dubbing them the “Cannibal at Dawn”. Though I’ve gone along with the serial killer notion, I know what took those innocent lives wasn’t a man. I have a grasp on what it is based on what I already know about Native American folklore, but I won’t dare say its name.

1qk7lp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1qk7lp5/gum_paindiscomfort_in_top_front_part_of_teeth/,Gum pain/discomfort in top front part of teeth,"So. This is a weird story, and please read with the fact that it will answer any questions you ask to attempt to fix this issue.

I am 21, Since about early/mid December. Ive been experiencing some localized gum discomfort/pain in the top front part of my gums (both inner and outer parts of that region, but mostly the inside. I thought it would go away on its own. And it hasnt. Ive seen my dentist about a week or two ago, and she basically shrugged at me. Said that it could be several things. But likely is just gum trauma. No signs of cavities, no signs of infection, and just to try and ride it out (also used it as an opportunity to suggest invisalign to me for some reason.) 

Im sick of having to be careful about everything I eat. Avoiding acidic and crunchy foods, cut out soda and coffee (coffee being a huge hobby of mine which feels incredibly frustrating to have to sacrifice) for the past month and a half almost. 

Yes, I do smoke. I smoke cigars (which im not going to get into my own anecdotes that ive done within my personal research and experience with the downsides between premium cigars and cigarettes) however. Its something thats required of me in my job. I work at a cigar lounge. I havent smoked a cigar in over a month to try and prevent irritation. Which has been great for my confidence in the habit not being a problem for me. But its seriously hampering my ability to  A. Do my job and do it well and B. Enjoy it.  I drink maybe 3 times a month. And its almost always very very little, with plenty of water to ensure hydration. 

Ive tried peroxide mouthwash 3 times a week, weekly, as to not erode any enamel but have stopped due to concerns of it eroding enamel. And i have been consistently using a warm saltwater rinse 4ish times a day

I was formerly diagnosed with gingivitis. I used to have a mild case. As I used to take very poor care of my teeth, since then it has been declared in remission, and I have very very healthy teeth and gums (aside from the minor breakout of plaque which i usually scrape away gently) 

I take no medications, but i do take vitamin c, Ashwaghanda, and a multivitamin, along with some magnesium for stress. Ive also been taking ibuprofen and acetaminophen to help with managing the pain and soreness at work. 

If you have any further questions. Please dont hesitate to ask. I just want to resolve this as quickly as I possibly can.

1qk7ll7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somalia/comments/1qk7ll7/the_linguistic_genius_of_our_awoowes_and_ayeeyos/,The Linguistic Genius of our Awoowes and Ayeeyos - Part 1,"While working on the etymology of Somali names ([somaliname.com](http://somaliname.com/) previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnSomali/comments/1pip07x/the_most_detailed_somali_names_resource_online/)), something clicked in my mind, and now I see Somali words differently. The examples below are just surface-level observations, meant to show the most accessible layer of meaning before getting into deeper, more structural patterns.

For example, when you ask someone their age in Somali, the word used is **da**. It is rooted in weather, with **da** meaning rain, so asking someone their '*da’* is essentially asking how many rain seasons, or **Gu**, they have lived through.

Another example is the word **agoon** (orphan). It combine **ag**, meaning near or by, and **oon**, meaning thirst. Conceptually, this presents the orphan as someone who exists close to deprivation. In a nomadic pastoral society, thirst and hunger are existential conditions. When a child loses their father, the primary provider is gone, placing the child in a state symbolically near thirst and hunger even if food and water still exist.

I have also come up with some personal theories about how certain words may have been formed. One example is the Somali word for the number four, **afar**. My theory is that it is a descriptive term made up of **af** meaning mouth and **far** meaning finger/thumb. When a child sucks their thumb (the thumb is in the mouth,) leaving four visible fingers. The number is identified by what remains.

Our ancestors didn’t just create words, they created a system, an algorithm, that could generate new words for things that didn’t even exist thousands of years ago. Every morpheme carries a core conceptual meaning, whether about containment, emergence, or crystallization, and nothing is random. This system encodes how concepts relate to the world, the body, society, and thought, allowing speakers not only to describe what already exists, but to invent words for new technologies, ideas, or phenomena that had never been imagined. In a sense, Somali is timeless and forward-looking: the logic our ancestors embedded allows us to create meaningful words for the modern age, and even for things that will emerge in the future. Even more amazingly, it allows us to **map words backwards** and uncover the meaning of words we might have no idea about today, revealing the conceptual structure hidden within the language. And yet, over time, much of this understanding has been lost. We rely on loanwords from other languages, forgetting that our own language contains a deep, precise, and surprisingly algorithmic system capable of mapping life itself across time. Studying Somali morphemes like **-uur**, **-ax**, and **-ti** gives a glimpse into this ancient genius, a system that is elegant, logical, and endlessly creative. Every suffix, prefix, infix, or even a standalone word can be isolated and grouped within a category.

In Somali, the suffix **–uur** marks things that are **held, enclosed, or contained**. It’s about what is **inside, nurtured, or surrounded**, whether physically, biologically, or socially. Think of it as the suffix that emphasizes **internality, protection, or accumulation,** like something kept within a boundary, whether it’s life inside a womb (*uur*), water in the clouds (*daruur*), or children growing within a family (*caruur,*) -uur is tied to the idea of **uur**.

**abuur** → (ab + uur) life **enclosed** within matter

**uur** → biological life **enclosed** in the womb

**caruur** → people who **developed within** an a family and also from uur and guur

**baruur** → body **enveloped by** stored substance

**buur** → earth **gathered into** an enclosing mass

**daruur** → water **contained within** a surrounding mass

**duur** → dense land that **surrounds and engulfs**

**cambuur** → garment that **encloses the body**

**baabuur** → structure that **encloses and carries** people

**huur** → heat that **immerses and surrounds** the body

**guur** → entry into a **new enclosed unit** (household)

**aruur** → bringing things **into one enclosure**

**tuur** → **hatchback** — a container **shaped by what it carries inside**

**faruur** → **edge of enclosure** (mouth) where inside meets outside

**fuur** → corpse **swollen from internal gases**, body **expanded and filled from within**

The original title for this post was ""**Dayuur/Dayuurad** is a Somali word and **Diyaarad** is not."" I used to think the opposite and always wondered why some people call airplanes *dayuurad* when everyone else says *diyaarad*. Turns out *diyaarad* is just a transliteration of the Arabic word ***ṭayyārah*** (with variations across Arabic dialects) and doesn't follow any Somali morpheme rules. Sure, ***diyaar*** means ""ready,"" so you could argue it suggests express transportation, but that interpretation doesn't reconcile with how other Somali words are structured. On the flip side, *dayuur/dayuurad* makes perfect sense: the **da** prefix marks emergence into visible motion or effect from an elevated state, whether lightning, moonlight, or clouds, and it's not random that *daxay*, *danab*, and *daruur* all share this prefix. The uur suffix works just like it does in *baabuur*, meaning a structure that encloses and carries people. So *dayuur/dayuurad* correctly maps to a vessel that carries from above and moves visibly through space, a perfectly logical Somali word we replaced with a loanword.

**–ax (emergence / externalization)**

The suffix **–ax** is all about **coming out, breaking through, or emerging**. It marks things that **move from inside → outside**, whether physically, biologically, or metaphorically. Everything with –ax is tied to the idea of **bax,** emergence, release, or exposure from **madax** (head, first out at birth and the part of the body through which speech exits) to **qorax** (sun, constantly emitting light) to **malax** (pus coming out of a wound). It’s the suffix of **manifestation and externalization**.

**bax** → to exit, go out, sprout

**cawrax** → dryness (internal moisture gone → external state)

**dhagax** → stone (matter hardened and exposed)

**dhiigbax** → bleeding (blood exiting the body)

**farax** → a name/word meaning joy or happiness (emotion coming out)

**fax** → rushing, gushing out

**galax** → fresh milk or water, or the vessel for it (designed to pour out)

**galayax** → untidy, unwieldy (things spilling out beyond containment)

**kalax** → ladle, water dipper, or cup (tool for extracting/pouring)

**kax** → barren land or desert (land exposed; life has left)

**lax** → black-headed sheep (stands out, externally visible, like **madax**)

**nax** → to be startled or frightened (internal shock bursts outward)

**qalax** → stony desert (land stripped, exposed)

**qarax** = explosion / blast (something contained is suddenly released and manifests externally.)

**qax** → evacuation, fleeing (mass exit)

**qorax** → sun (energy continuously emitted outward)

**sax** → correct, exact (clarity revealed, externalized truth)

**tax** → to thread, align, or arrange (organizing things so they’re externally legible)

**wax** → a thing, matter, or something (something that has emerged into existence metaphorically or physically)

**madax** → head (first thing to come out at birth; leading point of emergence, speech exits)

**adhax** → spine / backbone (internal structure that defines emergence and support; central axis from which movement and form project outward)

**malax** → pus (matter coming out from a wound; internal → external)

**–ti (crystallization / recognition)**

On the other hand, **–ti** is the suffix of **closure, stabilization, and recognition**. It takes something **open, potential, or ongoing** and turns it into a **settled, fixed, or socially recognized state**. For example, movement becomes a **marti** (guest), speech capacity becomes an **afti** (opinion), and fleeing becomes a **qaxooti** (refugee). While –ax is about things emerging, **–ti** is about **those things being fixed, acknowledged, and crystallized**.

|**Base**|**–ti form**|**Open / unstable**|**Crystallized / recognized state**|**Notes**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||||||
|**ab**|**abti**|lineage / ancestry|maternal uncle (terminal male in lineage)|Lineage continuity stops here|
|**baq**|**baqti**|decay / fear|death|Biological / emotional process reaches terminal state|
|**af**|**afti**|mouth / speech capacity|opinion / referendum|Discussion / consent crystallized|
|**arag**|**aragti**|seeing|reflection / viewpoint / thought|Perception crystallized|
|**gal**|**galti**|entering / motion|foreigner|Social identity fixed|
|**gashaan**|**gashaanti**|lovers / couple|girl of marriageable age|Social / biological threshold reached|
|**han**|**hanti**|ambition / pride|wealth / possession|Aspirational desire crystallized|
|**kar**|**karti**|ability / potential|capability / strength / competence|Open potential becomes recognized trait|
|**mar**|**marti**|movement / passing|guest / visitors|Social presence fixed|
|**qax**|**qaxooti**|fleeing / escaping|refugee|Social/legal status fixed|

btw: i do understand the common spelling is bakhti and not baqti but the origin points to baq + -ti

**Reverse Example: ra+ti**

* **rati = male camel**
   * **ra-** = male / masculine classifier
   * **–ti** = fixed, recognized state

**Interpretation:** The broad concept of *rag (men/masculine)* is anchored to the camel domain and then crystallized by **ti** into a stable, socially recognized category, **male camel**.

You might challenge this and say that **ra-** does not mean male/masculine, and I too initially doubted this while reverse-engineering the word. I considered that **ra** might be an ancient root partially lost over time. Then I remembered the Somali word **rag**, meaning “men” or “masculine,” and realized that the final consonant can drop when combining a masculine root with a feminine suffix. A similar process occurs with **bil** (“month”) when forming **bisha** (“the month”), where the **L** is dropped. In the same way, the **G** in **rag** is dropped to form **rati** instead of **ragti**. Consonant reduction, doubling, vowel stretching or shifting is common in Somali morphology.

**Pattern:** prefix introduces the subset or classifier → suffix **–ti** fixes it into a stable, recognized entity.  
In Somali, the suffix **-ti** is a **directional derivational marker**, establishing a one-way relationship between the derived form and its root. The derived form necessarily **entails the root**, but the root does **not automatically entail the derived form**. For example, *abti* (maternal uncle) presupposes belonging to the *ab* (lineage), but not every member of the lineage is an *abti*. *Marti* (guest) presupposes that someone has *mar* (passed through), yet merely passing through does not make one a *marti*. Likewise, *qaxooti* (refugee) presupposes that someone has *qax* (fled), but not everyone who flees is a *qaxooti*, since they may simply be internally displaced. Every **rati** (male camel) is **rag** but not all rag are **rati** . This asymmetry is the defining property of -ti: it **selects a specific, recognized subset of the root’s domain** and fixes it as a socially or functionally terminal state. Unlike English suffixes such as **-ee** (employ → *employee*, train → *trainee*, pay → *payee*) are only partially directional and easily break down with words like *free*, *coffee*, *tree*, or *degree*, showing that English lacks a **productive, semantically invariant, and directional suffix** comparable to Somali **-ti**.which are lexically restricted and inconsistent, Somali -ti is **productive, semantically invariant, and directional**, making it a robust morphological mechanism across the language.

Back to my point about how Somali encodes mechanisms for creating new words. The Somali word for *satellite* is **dayax-gacmeed**. The **dayax** component conveys something elevated or in the sky, but semantically it is already reserved for the moon. The appended **gacmeed** literally means “hand-made,” so the compound as a whole describes a *man-made object in the sky*. While this construction is perfectly valid in Somali, it functions more as a descriptive workaround than as a word generated organically through the language’s internal morphemic system.

Our ancestors, however, left us with productive building blocks capable of generating new terms, just as they did with words like *airplane*. Using those native morphemes, we can construct a term for *satellite* without relying on descriptive add-ons:

* **da-** → emergence into visibility / from an elevated state (operation in the sky)
* **-yuur** → vessel, carrier, enclosure
* **-ax** → emission, release, or externalized effect (such as signals or radiation)

Combined, these yield:

**Dayuurax** — literally, *“a sky-borne carrier that emits.”*

This construction reflects a satellite’s actual function: an object operating above that carries and emits signals. More importantly, it demonstrates that Somali’s morphemic system is forward-looking, capable of describing technologies that did not exist thousands of years ago while remaining internally logical and semantically precise.

That said, I’m not disregarding the fact that **dayax** itself can be analyzed morphologically:

* **day-** → look (seeing, search)
* **-ax** → emission, externalization

Under this analysis, **dayax** is interpreted as *“that which manifests to enable seeing”* or *“guide-light.”* This interpretation does not contradict the **da-** sense of emergence or elevation; rather, it reinforces it, positioning the moon as a ""guiding light that appears from above.""",3,1769117827.0,Somalia,0,1.0,False

1qk7l0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qk7l0l/an_early_mourning/,An Early Mourning,"My alarm goes off, snatching me from the dream I already forgot. I reach for my phone to shut it off and almost simultaneously, there’s movement on top of me. The silhouette of my two-year-old cat soon meets my face and releases a string of high pitch meows, undoubtedly demanding breakfast.

“Good morning to you too, Maggie,” I say in between chuckles, “Yeah, let’s get you some food.”

Maggie lets out an excited chirp and promptly leaps off my chest. I hear her scamper off while I swing my legs over the edge of my bed, mentally preparing myself to start the day. I finally heave myself off my bed and walk to the kitchen to feed Maggie. When I flick on the kitchen light, I’m not startled by the bright light thanks to the dimmer my roommate and I chose to install. Considering our schedules, we usually kept it at a low setting. As I open a can of wet food and plop its contents onto one of Maggie’s plates, she purrs and rubs herself against my legs. This was the sort of affection that made a 4am wakeup tolerable. 

“Here you go, little baby,” I softly say as I crouch to place the plate on a mat for Maggie to dig in and she very much does. The air fills solely with the sounds of her eager munching until the coffee machine joins the ambience while I make myself a sandwich. Maggie finishes her meal just as I’m starting mine, then she hops onto the table to nuzzle my arm while I scroll through social media. Once I finish my sandwich, I continue with the rest of my usual routine by getting dressed, brushing my teeth, brushing my hair only to hide it with a hat, and then pouring the coffee into a travel mug. Per usual, I still have fifteen minutes before I need to leave so I sit on the couch to play with Maggie. I watch her continuously leap about as she tries to snag the toy, I goad her with and I can’t help but wonder how she stores so much energy in such a tiny body. We burn through fifteen minutes faster than we’d like and I begrudgingly head to the door. Maggie bats at my laces while I get my shoes on before I scoop her up for one more embrace.

“Goodbye, Maggie, I’ll see you later,” I tell her as if she understands my words, but perhaps she does. I let her down and she scampers off into the darkness of the house. I gather my bag and travel mug and then realize I have to accommodate for a full bag of trash I know I should take now rather than later. With as much finesse as I could hope for, I take the bag of trash with me as I exit the door and lock it behind me. 

The outside air is brisk but I’m grateful for the lack of snowfall. I quickly walk to my garage, opening and closing the door with a swiftness. The enclosed space offers little relief from the outside as my breath is faintly visible. I drop the bag of trash by my car before I place my pack on the back seat and then myself in the driver’s seat. I press the ignition to start and I try to patiently wait a handful of minutes before I turn the heater on. I scroll through my music app to select the tunes for the road and then I remember I’ve got a bag of trash yet to be thrown out. I groan, turn on the heater, and step out of my car to complete the task. I click the fob for my garage door before I close my car door and scoop up the bag of trash. I blankly stare ahead as the garage door takes its time to rise, revealing a dark and lonely alley. I mindlessly look to my left and nearly jump out of my skin.

At the end of the alley stands a person, their form is entirely shrouded with darkness due to the streetlight shining down behind them. From what I can tell, they have shoulder length hair and are about my height. Despite my intrusion, they stay standing there without making any movement or sounds. I decide to not make a weird situation weirder and turn away from them to dump the bag into the dumpster. After doing so, I avert my direct gaze from the motionless person as I walk back to my car. Once inside, I lock the doors twice and exhale deeply as I try to rid myself of my nerves. I'm just about to shift my car into reverse when I look up at my rear-view mirror and feel a heavier wave of fear wash over me than before. Right at the edge of my garage now stands that same person that stood at the end of the alley. Only this time they have their back to me.

Aided by the garage light, I can now tell their hair color to be black and the particular hair style seems familiar. I ease the tension I’ve unknowingly applied onto the wheel and shifter as sweat begins to build on my palms. I then shift into reverse so that I can use the back camera to broaden my view. Doing so reveals the person to be dressed in a white robe and blue pajama bottoms while their feet remain bare. I momentarily rack my brain when familiarity makes me realize this is my neighbor: a single mom of two by the name of Ms. Barrett. Confusion takes the forefront of my mind, but fear is still a close second as I wonder what could be going on with her. 

I should check if she’s okay, I think to myself as I put my car into park. Just as I unlock the doors, the light of my garage flicks off. The added darkness causes fear to creep up, but it shoots up when I check my rear-view mirror and no longer see Ms. Barrett. I then hear the back door on the passenger side open and I turn around to see no one. A sharp tap on my driver’s side window makes me whip my face towards it and there’s no one there either, but the glass is lightly fogged up. The car suddenly shifts and a primitive sixth sense causes goosebumps to erupt all over my body. I don’t even need to look in the rear-view to know she’s in the back seat and almost as a response, her raspy breathing becomes audible. My body is locked in place while my heart threatens to beat through my rib cage. Despite my desperate, internal pleading, I slowly shift my eyes toward the mirror. With the garage door still being open, I’m able to make out the silhouette of Ms. Barrett while her features remain hidden by the darkness. I feel my jaw muscles twitch as I want to verbally confirm that it’s her, because at this point, I feel no different than a child staring into an open closet in the dead of night.

“Where… are… my… children?”

Those first three words come out labored and drawn out in a decent attempt at impersonating Ms. Barrett, but that final word is spoken entirely differently. It’s masculine and I can tell they only have malicious intent. To my greater horror, I watch as the thing in Ms. Barrett’s skin leans towards the mirror. Through the glow of my dashboard and my eyes becoming attuned with the dark, the features on Ms. Barrett’s face become visible, along with the blood that coats the bottom half of her face. Her face is practically parallel to mine when I hear it parts her lips into a grin, confirmed by my peripheral vision. I can’t bring myself to face it, let alone shift my eyes toward it as they remain glued to the mirror. I hear it exhale and a sickly-sweet odor wafts from its mouth, making me clench my teeth so as to not gag. It leans even closer, just shy of pressing Ms. Barrett’s lips against the mirror. While doing so, I get a good look at the eyes and confirm that not only are they not Ms. Barrett’s eyes, but they are also wells of madness. 

“Here they are.”

The masculine voice speaks as this thing has entirely given up on its sick game of deception. It then began to open its mouth hazardously wide; I can hear the tension it’s placing on the ends of its mouth and the hinges of its jaw. At the same time, more of that sickly sweet odor escapes its growing maw. I’m pinned to my seat at the sheer insanity I’m witnessing and it’s only when I hear the sides of its mouth begin to rip that I’m able to snap out of my shock. I fumble the door open, tumbling out onto the garage floor in the process, but the adrenaline helps me roll back onto my feet quickly. I’m now two yards away from my open car door and three yards away from my closed garage door. I take slow steps as I keep my eyes on the mimic in my car, instinctively putting my hands up like a barrier. Suddenly, the sounds of flesh tearing stop. Then I watch my car turn off, followed by my garage door’s slow descent, allowing darkness to engulf my garage. My quickening breathing becomes the only audible sound as I become frozen once again. A moment passes before my breathing is accompanied by the creaking of my car and shuffling of fabric. It takes me a second to piece together that the mimic is crawling over my seat to get out. That’s when I hear my car door slam.

I spin around and bolt for the garage door. Miraculously, I find the knob right away and damn near break the door off its hinges as I ram my shoulder into it. I clear the distance between my garage and my house at athletic speed, crashing into the door as I’m unable to stop in time. I frantically pull out my keys and miss the keyhole twice before unlocking the door and stepping inside. I have the door in hand when I turn around and see the mimic standing in the doorway of my garage, facing away from me. I watch it kick into a backwards sprint and then I slam the door and fasten every lock. I hear no further sounds as I back away until I hear Maggie’s hiss behind me. I turn around and faintly see her silhouette with her fur standing on end with her back arched in anger. 

“Get back, Maggie, we’re gonna be okay,” I tell her as I beckon her away with my hand. A loud thud reverberates from the door, making me whip my head back towards it and silencing Maggie’s hissing. A second one erupts from the door, rattling us and the room alike. As the room grows quiet, I pick up an indiscernible sound coming from the thing outside my door. I approached the door with caution and it was only when my ear was hovering above the door that I could make out the sound.

“Let me in, let me in, let me in,” the mimic rapidly repeats with a gleeful ferocity like a hyena approaching its prey. I stumble away as I frantically try to think about what to do when I hear Maggie let out a frightened yowl. I look back and faintly see her cowering behind the leg of a kitchen chair. The sight of her emboldens me as I then face the door and call out with every ounce of paternal energy within me, “I am not letting you in!”

The mimic’s repetition immediately stops. I take a step forward and demand with venom in my voice, “Leave us alone.”

A moment passes and then the laughing begins. The laughter not only comes from beyond the door, but it seems to come from all around the room. I don’t just hear the mimic’s masculine voice, a chorus of various voices joins in, including Ms. Barrett and her children. The laughter continues to crescendo, becoming unbearable, and then it stops. As if whispering right into my ear, I hear the mimic say, “I don’t need your permission to enter.”

A third, splintering thud erupts from the door and it’s evident the door won’t hold much longer. I run to the block of knives and grab the largest one before taking my place in the center of the kitchen. I grip the handle hard enough that the building sweat won’t make it slip out of my hand. My body shakes all over, it practically tries to make me run away, but I need to stand my ground. After all, what use would there be in running to my room, why would a second locked door make any difference? I have to meet this terror right here, especially to keep my little Maggie safe. I briefly look away from the door to see that Maggie has fled to the living room and at that moment, I hear the door swing open and hit the wall. I return my gaze to the open door, still intact as if I had undone the locks myself. The only sign of contact was a large crevice on the outside of the door. I look beyond the open doorway and spot the mimic in the doorway of my garage again. This time, it’s facing me. 

While the backside of Ms. Barrett’s white robe remained pristine, the front had been desecrated with what I horrifyingly assume to be blood. I observe its hands, fingers hooked like talons, are also coated with blood. My eyes flick up to its face and I’m forced to stifle a scream. The mimic had ripped a Cheshire smile onto its rendition of Ms. Barrett’s face. An equally broad grin gleamed from within despite its teeth being stained with gore. As if I have zero depth perception, I watch the mimic take a single step and suddenly it’s in front of me, just before the threshold of the door. It slightly tilts its head to the side before saying, “Momma, no… please don’t… Mommy!”

It spoke with the voices of Ms. Barrett’s children; it hadn’t replicated their voices perfectly but it was enough to make my eyes water.

Those poor children, I think to myself as I wipe my eyes and a searing anger builds within me. I take a step forward and thrust the kitchen knife, aiming for this thing’s center mass. But the blade never makes contact. It’s as if the space between the tip of the blade and the mimic’s chest stretched just enough to not allow contact. I pull the knife back in utter confusion and the mimic chuckles at me with its masculine voice. It then thrusts its arm forward, striking my chest with its palm, and sending me flying backwards. The knife flies out of my hand and my back collides with the edge of the counter, before I smack onto the floor. The wind is knocked completely out of me; I can’t even look up at the monstrosity invading my home. I listen to its bare feet pat against the tiled floor as it walks towards me.

“Those were poor children, indeed. To think the last thing they saw was their mother lunging at them with a mountain lion’s hunger. The same mother that cared and nurtured them also bit into their flesh and suckled marrow from their broken bones.”

It’s now beside me; through blurry vision I watch it crouch and lean close to me.

“I will do the same with you; I’ll wear your face while I eat that little kitten of yours. Then I’ll wait for your roommate to arrive and tear him apart all the same.”

I hear Maggie hiss again and watch the mimic’s face snap in her direction, giggling before licking its lips.

“You won’t get the same mercy the mother got, I’m going to eat this runt of yours in front of you.”

Before I can protest, it lifts me off the floor with one hand and repositions me so I can now see Maggie. Her ears are pointed downward and despite her fear, she remains coiled in the dining room, standing her ground in her own way.

“Please, don’t,” I beg as I grab onto the mimic’s ankle in a feeble attempt to detain it. I hear it laugh as it easily breaks free of my grasp. Then I watch it raise the same foot and feel it stomp onto my head. The sound my head makes against the tiled floor is sickening and I’m left completely disoriented. I’m unable to do anything as the mimic crouches, takes my left hand, and bites into my index and middle finger. My scream is partially muffled to myself as it thrashes back and forth until it successfully detaches my fingers, leaving bloody stumps in their place. I listen to it chew on my fingers for a couple of moments before swallowing, bones and all. While in close proximity to me, I watch the mimic’s features painfully shift as it attempts to replicate my face. The end result is a perverse amalgamation of Ms. Barrett’s face and my own, but just like before, its true eyes remain in place. 

“This will have to do,” it says with a sneer, before rising and turning away from me. I hear it call to Maggie with a sing-song voice, with my voice, as it strolls towards her. Maggie no longer hisses at the mimic; she becomes wide eyed and frozen as that monstrosity looms over her.

“Please run away, please, Maggie,” I sorrowfully beg while all I can do is watch. Just as the mimic is upon her, her eyes leave it and meet mine.

I push myself off of the floor and tear a path at the mimic. It doesn’t react in time and I tackle the mimic to the floor, causing Maggie to flee to the living room. I waste no time as I take a handful of its hair and smash its face into the hardwood floor.

“Stay the fuck away from my cat,” I growl, repeatedly smashing its face in synchrony with every syllable. I finally drop its head, leaving the mimic motionless on the floor as blood pools from its face. I take a step toward the living room and call for Maggie, but I stop when I hear the mimic’s muffled laughter. I hear it peel its head off the floor, so I turn around to see it looking up at me with a big smile on its tattered face. It shoots its hand out, catching my right leg and pulling it to make me fall onto my back. I don’t falter and launch two solid kicks to its face, freeing my right leg of its grasp. I scramble to my feet, grab a chair, and use it like a battering ram against the mimic. I only get it to the doorway that divides my kitchen and dining room when the mimic completely halts my momentum, snatches the chair out of my hands, and flings it aside. Then it simply steps backwards and around the corner, leaving my sight. 

Panic makes me run after it, but it’s nowhere to be found. I back up into the kitchen and quickly retrieve a steak knife from a drawer. A heart aching yowl from Maggie draws my attention and I see her in the clutches of the mimic. She’s desperately trying to wriggle free and claw at its hand, but that thing has its fingers dug into her scruff and held away from its face. The mimic tilts its head slightly downward as it casts a sinister smile at me. Fear and adrenaline course through my veins as I take off in a sprint at it, but my dining room seems to impossibly stretch on and on. I pump my legs faster, stamp my feet harder, but I just can’t seem to reach them. I watch the mimic use its other hand to grab Maggie by her hind legs, positioning her body in front of its mouth. Then the knife flies out of my hand and plunges into the stomach of the mimic. The knife seems to inflict surprise rather than pain as the mimic simply stops to look down at the protruding handle. I finally close the distance, grab onto its shoulder with my left hand, and retrieve the knife with my right. I then feverishly stab into the mimic and continue throughout its torso. I listen to the mimic’s laughter turn into gurgles as blood escapes its mouth. It clamps a hand on my left forearm, almost stabbing its nails into my skin if it weren’t for my fleece jacket, as it tries to pry my hand off of it. In turn, I grip tighter onto its shoulder and continue my assault. I watch its smile turn into a scowl and feel its fingernails turn into claws as they now stab into my left forearm. It clamps its other hand onto my throat and slams me onto the floor, leaving the knife embedded in its chest. I only have my right hand to try to remove its hand from my throat, but it's evident by the mimic’s strength just how fruitless my attempt is.

“Just who do you think you are,” the mimic snarls as it closes its fingers on my throat, making me struggle for air, “You are a fucking worm compared to me. All of you are so far beneath me! And you are becoming annoying to deal with.”

The mimic squeezes harder and I feel the blood vessels in my face near their limits. As the darkness creeps in from the sides of my vision, a shadow suddenly leaps onto the mimic’s face. Maggie has latched onto its face and started her own assault through bites and scratches. The mimic detaches its claws from my left forearm and stabs them into Maggie’s tiny body. She cries out in pain, she cries out to me, and then she is silent. I watch the mimic toss her aside before licking her blood off its claws with delight. My eyes become locked onto her crumpled form for what feels like eternity and then I black out.

 

I’m stirred awake by someone shaking me and I recognize them to be my roommate, Jordan. There’s panic in his voice and fear in his eyes as he tries to get answers out of me, but I give none. I watch him dial into his phone and back away as he likely gets in touch with a 911 operator. My body feels excruciatingly heavy and the numbness I’ve been feeling has now given way to waves of increasing pain. As I try to observe myself and my surroundings, I realize my right eye isn’t working, I’m covered in more blood than I remember, and I’m holding something in my right hand. I’ve been cradling it against my chest and when I pull it away to see what it is, a deep sorrow strikes my heart. It’s Maggie’s lifeless body. I scream out my sobs and tears cascade from my one good eye. Jordan rushes over to witness the source of my agony and joins my mourning. 

Shortly after I’m taken to a hospital where I’m treated for my injuries and the whole thing passes by in a blur. I wake up the next day and I appear like I returned from a warzone. A nurse tells me they all initially thought I was the victim of a wild animal attack, so when they learned I was the result of a home invasion, the shock had been immeasurable. Later one, I would be visited by a pair of officers, informing me they had already discovered the remains of Ms. Barrett and her children. Based on similarities with a case from a few months ago regarding the murders of a family of four, they linked the two incidents and interpreted the suspect as a serial killer. A week passes by before I learn that the information regarding the linked cases has been leaked to the media and my city becomes abuzz with the possibility of a modern serial killer. Some members of the media are lazy and refer to the suspect as “The Second Dahmer” while others flex their creativity by dubbing them the “Cannibal at Dawn”. Though I’ve gone along with the serial killer notion, I know what took those innocent lives wasn’t a man. I have a grasp on what it is based on what I already know about Native American folklore, but I won’t dare say its name. I have before, back when I had zero belief that something like that could exist. I fully believe now that there are things that lurk in the darkness around us, things too powerful for us to oppose. And I will become one of them.",1,1769117786.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1qk7juk,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1qk7juk/an_early_mourning/,An Early Mourning,"My alarm goes off, snatching me from the dream I already forgot. I reach for my phone to shut it off and almost simultaneously, there’s movement on top of me. The silhouette of my two-year-old cat soon meets my face and releases a string of high pitch meows, undoubtedly demanding breakfast.

“Good morning to you too, Maggie,” I say in between chuckles, “Yeah, let’s get you some food.”

Maggie lets out an excited chirp and promptly leaps off my chest. I hear her scamper off while I swing my legs over the edge of my bed, mentally preparing myself to start the day. I finally heave myself off my bed and walk to the kitchen to feed Maggie. When I flick on the kitchen light, I’m not startled by the bright light thanks to the dimmer my roommate and I chose to install. Considering our schedules, we usually kept it at a low setting. As I open a can of wet food and plop its contents onto one of Maggie’s plates, she purrs and rubs herself against my legs. This was the sort of affection that made a 4am wakeup tolerable. 

“Here you go, little baby,” I softly say as I crouch to place the plate on a mat for Maggie to dig in and she very much does. The air fills solely with the sounds of her eager munching until the coffee machine joins the ambience while I make myself a sandwich. Maggie finishes her meal just as I’m starting mine, then she hops onto the table to nuzzle my arm while I scroll through social media. Once I finish my sandwich, I continue with the rest of my usual routine by getting dressed, brushing my teeth, brushing my hair only to hide it with a hat, and then pouring the coffee into a travel mug. Per usual, I still have fifteen minutes before I need to leave so I sit on the couch to play with Maggie. I watch her continuously leap about as she tries to snag the toy, I goad her with and I can’t help but wonder how she stores so much energy in such a tiny body. We burn through fifteen minutes faster than we’d like and I begrudgingly head to the door. Maggie bats at my laces while I get my shoes on before I scoop her up for one more embrace.

“Goodbye, Maggie, I’ll see you later,” I tell her as if she understands my words, but perhaps she does. I let her down and she scampers off into the darkness of the house. I gather my bag and travel mug and then realize I have to accommodate for a full bag of trash I know I should take now rather than later. With as much finesse as I could hope for, I take the bag of trash with me as I exit the door and lock it behind me. 

The outside air is brisk but I’m grateful for the lack of snowfall. I quickly walk to my garage, opening and closing the door with a swiftness. The enclosed space offers little relief from the outside as my breath is faintly visible. I drop the bag of trash by my car before I place my pack on the back seat and then myself in the driver’s seat. I press the ignition to start and I try to patiently wait a handful of minutes before I turn the heater on. I scroll through my music app to select the tunes for the road and then I remember I’ve got a bag of trash yet to be thrown out. I groan, turn on the heater, and step out of my car to complete the task. I click the fob for my garage door before I close my car door and scoop up the bag of trash. I blankly stare ahead as the garage door takes its time to rise, revealing a dark and lonely alley. I mindlessly look to my left and nearly jump out of my skin.

At the end of the alley stands a person, their form is entirely shrouded with darkness due to the streetlight shining down behind them. From what I can tell, they have shoulder length hair and are about my height. Despite my intrusion, they stay standing there without making any movement or sounds. I decide to not make a weird situation weirder and turn away from them to dump the bag into the dumpster. After doing so, I avert my direct gaze from the motionless person as I walk back to my car. Once inside, I lock the doors twice and exhale deeply as I try to rid myself of my nerves. I'm just about to shift my car into reverse when I look up at my rear-view mirror and feel a heavier wave of fear wash over me than before. Right at the edge of my garage now stands that same person that stood at the end of the alley. Only this time they have their back to me.

Aided by the garage light, I can now tell their hair color to be black and the particular hair style seems familiar. I ease the tension I’ve unknowingly applied onto the wheel and shifter as sweat begins to build on my palms. I then shift into reverse so that I can use the back camera to broaden my view. Doing so reveals the person to be dressed in a white robe and blue pajama bottoms while their feet remain bare. I momentarily rack my brain when familiarity makes me realize this is my neighbor: a single mom of two by the name of Ms. Barrett. Confusion takes the forefront of my mind, but fear is still a close second as I wonder what could be going on with her. 

I should check if she’s okay, I think to myself as I put my car into park. Just as I unlock the doors, the light of my garage flicks off. The added darkness causes fear to creep up, but it shoots up when I check my rear-view mirror and no longer see Ms. Barrett. I then hear the back door on the passenger side open and I turn around to see no one. A sharp tap on my driver’s side window makes me whip my face towards it and there’s no one there either, but the glass is lightly fogged up. The car suddenly shifts and a primitive sixth sense causes goosebumps to erupt all over my body. I don’t even need to look in the rear-view to know she’s in the back seat and almost as a response, her raspy breathing becomes audible. My body is locked in place while my heart threatens to beat through my rib cage. Despite my desperate, internal pleading, I slowly shift my eyes toward the mirror. With the garage door still being open, I’m able to make out the silhouette of Ms. Barrett while her features remain hidden by the darkness. I feel my jaw muscles twitch as I want to verbally confirm that it’s her, because at this point, I feel no different than a child staring into an open closet in the dead of night.

“Where… are… my… children?”

Those first three words come out labored and drawn out in a decent attempt at impersonating Ms. Barrett, but that final word is spoken entirely differently. It’s masculine and I can tell they only have malicious intent. To my greater horror, I watch as the thing in Ms. Barrett’s skin leans towards the mirror. Through the glow of my dashboard and my eyes becoming attuned with the dark, the features on Ms. Barrett’s face become visible, along with the blood that coats the bottom half of her face. Her face is practically parallel to mine when I hear it parts her lips into a grin, confirmed by my peripheral vision. I can’t bring myself to face it, let alone shift my eyes toward it as they remain glued to the mirror. I hear it exhale and a sickly-sweet odor wafts from its mouth, making me clench my teeth so as to not gag. It leans even closer, just shy of pressing Ms. Barrett’s lips against the mirror. While doing so, I get a good look at the eyes and confirm that not only are they not Ms. Barrett’s eyes, but they are also wells of madness. 

“Here they are.”

The masculine voice speaks as this thing has entirely given up on its sick game of deception. It then began to open its mouth hazardously wide; I can hear the tension it’s placing on the ends of its mouth and the hinges of its jaw. At the same time, more of that sickly sweet odor escapes its growing maw. I’m pinned to my seat at the sheer insanity I’m witnessing and it’s only when I hear the sides of its mouth begin to rip that I’m able to snap out of my shock. I fumble the door open, tumbling out onto the garage floor in the process, but the adrenaline helps me roll back onto my feet quickly. I’m now two yards away from my open car door and three yards away from my closed garage door. I take slow steps as I keep my eyes on the mimic in my car, instinctively putting my hands up like a barrier. Suddenly, the sounds of flesh tearing stop. Then I watch my car turn off, followed by my garage door’s slow descent, allowing darkness to engulf my garage. My quickening breathing becomes the only audible sound as I become frozen once again. A moment passes before my breathing is accompanied by the creaking of my car and shuffling of fabric. It takes me a second to piece together that the mimic is crawling over my seat to get out. That’s when I hear my car door slam.

I spin around and bolt for the garage door. Miraculously, I find the knob right away and damn near break the door off its hinges as I ram my shoulder into it. I clear the distance between my garage and my house at athletic speed, crashing into the door as I’m unable to stop in time. I frantically pull out my keys and miss the keyhole twice before unlocking the door and stepping inside. I have the door in hand when I turn around and see the mimic standing in the doorway of my garage, facing away from me. I watch it kick into a backwards sprint and then I slam the door and fasten every lock. I hear no further sounds as I back away until I hear Maggie’s hiss behind me. I turn around and faintly see her silhouette with her fur standing on end with her back arched in anger. 

“Get back, Maggie, we’re gonna be okay,” I tell her as I beckon her away with my hand. A loud thud reverberates from the door, making me whip my head back towards it and silencing Maggie’s hissing. A second one erupts from the door, rattling us and the room alike. As the room grows quiet, I pick up an indiscernible sound coming from the thing outside my door. I approached the door with caution and it was only when my ear was hovering above the door that I could make out the sound.

“Let me in, let me in, let me in,” the mimic rapidly repeats with a gleeful ferocity like a hyena approaching its prey. I stumble away as I frantically try to think about what to do when I hear Maggie let out a frightened yowl. I look back and faintly see her cowering behind the leg of a kitchen chair. The sight of her emboldens me as I then face the door and call out with every ounce of paternal energy within me, “I am not letting you in!”

The mimic’s repetition immediately stops. I take a step forward and demand with venom in my voice, “Leave us alone.”

A moment passes and then the laughing begins. The laughter not only comes from beyond the door, but it seems to come from all around the room. I don’t just hear the mimic’s masculine voice, a chorus of various voices joins in, including Ms. Barrett and her children. The laughter continues to crescendo, becoming unbearable, and then it stops. As if whispering right into my ear, I hear the mimic say, “I don’t need your permission to enter.”

A third, splintering thud erupts from the door and it’s evident the door won’t hold much longer. I run to the block of knives and grab the largest one before taking my place in the center of the kitchen. I grip the handle hard enough that the building sweat won’t make it slip out of my hand. My body shakes all over, it practically tries to make me run away, but I need to stand my ground. After all, what use would there be in running to my room, why would a second locked door make any difference? I have to meet this terror right here, especially to keep my little Maggie safe. I briefly look away from the door to see that Maggie has fled to the living room and at that moment, I hear the door swing open and hit the wall. I return my gaze to the open door, still intact as if I had undone the locks myself. The only sign of contact was a large crevice on the outside of the door. I look beyond the open doorway and spot the mimic in the doorway of my garage again. This time, it’s facing me. 

While the backside of Ms. Barrett’s white robe remained pristine, the front had been desecrated with what I horrifyingly assume to be blood. I observe its hands, fingers hooked like talons, are also coated with blood. My eyes flick up to its face and I’m forced to stifle a scream. The mimic had ripped a Cheshire smile onto its rendition of Ms. Barrett’s face. An equally broad grin gleamed from within despite its teeth being stained with gore. As if I have zero depth perception, I watch the mimic take a single step and suddenly it’s in front of me, just before the threshold of the door. It slightly tilts its head to the side before saying, “Momma, no… please don’t… Mommy!”

It spoke with the voices of Ms. Barrett’s children; it hadn’t replicated their voices perfectly but it was enough to make my eyes water.

Those poor children, I think to myself as I wipe my eyes and a searing anger builds within me. I take a step forward and thrust the kitchen knife, aiming for this thing’s center mass. But the blade never makes contact. It’s as if the space between the tip of the blade and the mimic’s chest stretched just enough to not allow contact. I pull the knife back in utter confusion and the mimic chuckles at me with its masculine voice. It then thrusts its arm forward, striking my chest with its palm, and sending me flying backwards. The knife flies out of my hand and my back collides with the edge of the counter, before I smack onto the floor. The wind is knocked completely out of me; I can’t even look up at the monstrosity invading my home. I listen to its bare feet pat against the tiled floor as it walks towards me.

“Those were poor children, indeed. To think the last thing they saw was their mother lunging at them with a mountain lion’s hunger. The same mother that cared and nurtured them also bit into their flesh and suckled marrow from their broken bones.”

It’s now beside me; through blurry vision I watch it crouch and lean close to me.

“I will do the same with you; I’ll wear your face while I eat that little kitten of yours. Then I’ll wait for your roommate to arrive and tear him apart all the same.”

I hear Maggie hiss again and watch the mimic’s face snap in her direction, giggling before licking its lips.

“You won’t get the same mercy the mother got, I’m going to eat this runt of yours in front of you.”

Before I can protest, it lifts me off the floor with one hand and repositions me so I can now see Maggie. Her ears are pointed downward and despite her fear, she remains coiled in the dining room, standing her ground in her own way.

“Please, don’t,” I beg as I grab onto the mimic’s ankle in a feeble attempt to detain it. I hear it laugh as it easily breaks free of my grasp. Then I watch it raise the same foot and feel it stomp onto my head. The sound my head makes against the tiled floor is sickening and I’m left completely disoriented. I’m unable to do anything as the mimic crouches, takes my left hand, and bites into my index and middle finger. My scream is partially muffled to myself as it thrashes back and forth until it successfully detaches my fingers, leaving bloody stumps in their place.

While in close proximity to me, I watch the mimic’s features painfully shift as it attempts to replicate my face. The end result is a perverse amalgamation of Ms. Barrett’s face and my own, but just like before, its true eyes remain in place.

I finally drop its head, leaving the mimic motionless on the floor as blood pools from its face. I take a step toward the living room and call for Maggie, but I stop when I hear the mimic’s muffled laughter.

Maggie has latched onto its face and started her own assault through bites and scratches. The mimic detaches its claws from my left forearm and stabs them into Maggie’s tiny body. She cries out in pain, she cries out to me, and then she is silent. I watch the mimic toss her aside before licking her blood off its claws with delight. My eyes become locked onto her crumpled form for what feels like eternity and then I black out.

 

I’m stirred awake by someone shaking me and I recognize them to be my roommate, Jordan. There’s panic in his voice and fear in his eyes as he tries to get answers out of me, but I give none. I watch him dial into his phone and back away as he likely gets in touch with a 911 operator. My body feels excruciatingly heavy and the numbness I’ve been feeling has now given way to waves of increasing pain. As I try to observe myself and my surroundings, I realize my right eye isn’t working, I’m covered in more blood than I remember, and I’m holding something in my right hand. I’ve been cradling it against my chest and when I pull it away to see what it is, a deep sorrow strikes my heart. It’s Maggie’s lifeless body. I scream out my sobs and tears cascade from my one good eye. Jordan rushes over to witness the source of my agony and joins my mourning. 

Shortly after I’m taken to a hospital where I’m treated for my injuries and the whole thing passes by in a blur. I wake up the next day and I appear like I returned from a warzone. A nurse tells me they all initially thought I was the victim of a wild animal attack, so when they learned I was the result of a home invasion, the shock had been immeasurable. Later one, I would be visited by a pair of officers, informing me they had already discovered the remains of Ms. Barrett and her children. Based on similarities with a case from a few months ago regarding the murders of a family of four, they linked the two incidents and interpreted the suspect as a serial killer. A week passes by before I learn that the information regarding the linked cases has been leaked to the media and my city becomes abuzz with the possibility of a modern serial killer. Some members of the media are lazy and refer to the suspect as “The Second Dahmer” while others flex their creativity by dubbing them the “Cannibal at Dawn”. Though I’ve gone along with the serial killer notion, I know what took those innocent lives wasn’t a man. I have a grasp on what it is based on what I already know about Native American folklore, but I won’t dare say its name. I have before, back when I had zero belief that something like that could exist. I fully believe now that there are things that lurk in the darkness around us, things too powerful for us to oppose. And I will become one of them.",1,1769117711.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

1qk7hsx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qk7hsx/an_early_mourning/,An Early Mourning,"My alarm goes off, snatching me from the dream I already forgot. I reach for my phone to shut it off and almost simultaneously, there’s movement on top of me. The silhouette of my two-year-old cat soon meets my face and releases a string of high pitch meows, undoubtedly demanding breakfast.

“Good morning to you too, Maggie,” I say in between chuckles, “Yeah, let’s get you some food.”

Maggie lets out an excited chirp and promptly leaps off my chest. I hear her scamper off while I swing my legs over the edge of my bed, mentally preparing myself to start the day. I finally heave myself off my bed and walk to the kitchen to feed Maggie. When I flick on the kitchen light, I’m not startled by the bright light thanks to the dimmer my roommate and I chose to install. Considering our schedules, we usually kept it at a low setting. As I open a can of wet food and plop its contents onto one of Maggie’s plates, she purrs and rubs herself against my legs. This was the sort of affection that made a 4am wakeup tolerable. 

“Here you go, little baby,” I softly say as I crouch to place the plate on a mat for Maggie to dig in and she very much does. The air fills solely with the sounds of her eager munching until the coffee machine joins the ambience while I make myself a sandwich. Maggie finishes her meal just as I’m starting mine, then she hops onto the table to nuzzle my arm while I scroll through social media. Once I finish my sandwich, I continue with the rest of my usual routine by getting dressed, brushing my teeth, brushing my hair only to hide it with a hat, and then pouring the coffee into a travel mug. Per usual, I still have fifteen minutes before I need to leave so I sit on the couch to play with Maggie. I watch her continuously leap about as she tries to snag the toy, I goad her with and I can’t help but wonder how she stores so much energy in such a tiny body. We burn through fifteen minutes faster than we’d like and I begrudgingly head to the door. Maggie bats at my laces while I get my shoes on before I scoop her up for one more embrace.

“Goodbye, Maggie, I’ll see you later,” I tell her as if she understands my words, but perhaps she does. I let her down and she scampers off into the darkness of the house. I gather my bag and travel mug and then realize I have to accommodate for a full bag of trash I know I should take now rather than later. With as much finesse as I could hope for, I take the bag of trash with me as I exit the door and lock it behind me. 

The outside air is brisk but I’m grateful for the lack of snowfall. I quickly walk to my garage, opening and closing the door with a swiftness. The enclosed space offers little relief from the outside as my breath is faintly visible. I drop the bag of trash by my car before I place my pack on the back seat and then myself in the driver’s seat. I press the ignition to start and I try to patiently wait a handful of minutes before I turn the heater on. I scroll through my music app to select the tunes for the road and then I remember I’ve got a bag of trash yet to be thrown out. I groan, turn on the heater, and step out of my car to complete the task. I click the fob for my garage door before I close my car door and scoop up the bag of trash. I blankly stare ahead as the garage door takes its time to rise, revealing a dark and lonely alley. I mindlessly look to my left and nearly jump out of my skin.

At the end of the alley stands a person, their form is entirely shrouded with darkness due to the streetlight shining down behind them. From what I can tell, they have shoulder length hair and are about my height. Despite my intrusion, they stay standing there without making any movement or sounds. I decide to not make a weird situation weirder and turn away from them to dump the bag into the dumpster. After doing so, I avert my direct gaze from the motionless person as I walk back to my car. Once inside, I lock the doors twice and exhale deeply as I try to rid myself of my nerves. I'm just about to shift my car into reverse when I look up at my rear-view mirror and feel a heavier wave of fear wash over me than before. Right at the edge of my garage now stands that same person that stood at the end of the alley. Only this time they have their back to me.

Aided by the garage light, I can now tell their hair color to be black and the particular hair style seems familiar. I ease the tension I’ve unknowingly applied onto the wheel and shifter as sweat begins to build on my palms. I then shift into reverse so that I can use the back camera to broaden my view. Doing so reveals the person to be dressed in a white robe and blue pajama bottoms while their feet remain bare. I momentarily rack my brain when familiarity makes me realize this is my neighbor: a single mom of two by the name of Ms. Barrett. Confusion takes the forefront of my mind, but fear is still a close second as I wonder what could be going on with her. 

I should check if she’s okay, I think to myself as I put my car into park. Just as I unlock the doors, the light of my garage flicks off. The added darkness causes fear to creep up, but it shoots up when I check my rear-view mirror and no longer see Ms. Barrett. I then hear the back door on the passenger side open and I turn around to see no one. A sharp tap on my driver’s side window makes me whip my face towards it and there’s no one there either, but the glass is lightly fogged up. The car suddenly shifts and a primitive sixth sense causes goosebumps to erupt all over my body. I don’t even need to look in the rear-view to know she’s in the back seat and almost as a response, her raspy breathing becomes audible. My body is locked in place while my heart threatens to beat through my rib cage. Despite my desperate, internal pleading, I slowly shift my eyes toward the mirror. With the garage door still being open, I’m able to make out the silhouette of Ms. Barrett while her features remain hidden by the darkness. I feel my jaw muscles twitch as I want to verbally confirm that it’s her, because at this point, I feel no different than a child staring into an open closet in the dead of night.

“Where… are… my… children?”

Those first three words come out labored and drawn out in a decent attempt at impersonating Ms. Barrett, but that final word is spoken entirely differently. It’s masculine and I can tell they only have malicious intent. To my greater horror, I watch as the thing in Ms. Barrett’s skin leans towards the mirror. Through the glow of my dashboard and my eyes becoming attuned with the dark, the features on Ms. Barrett’s face become visible, along with the blood that coats the bottom half of her face. Her face is practically parallel to mine when I hear it parts her lips into a grin, confirmed by my peripheral vision. I can’t bring myself to face it, let alone shift my eyes toward it as they remain glued to the mirror. I hear it exhale and a sickly-sweet odor wafts from its mouth, making me clench my teeth so as to not gag. It leans even closer, just shy of pressing Ms. Barrett’s lips against the mirror. While doing so, I get a good look at the eyes and confirm that not only are they not Ms. Barrett’s eyes, but they are also wells of madness. 

“Here they are.”

The masculine voice speaks as this thing has entirely given up on its sick game of deception. It then began to open its mouth hazardously wide; I can hear the tension it’s placing on the ends of its mouth and the hinges of its jaw. At the same time, more of that sickly sweet odor escapes its growing maw. I’m pinned to my seat at the sheer insanity I’m witnessing and it’s only when I hear the sides of its mouth begin to rip that I’m able to snap out of my shock. I fumble the door open, tumbling out onto the garage floor in the process, but the adrenaline helps me roll back onto my feet quickly. I’m now two yards away from my open car door and three yards away from my closed garage door. I take slow steps as I keep my eyes on the mimic in my car, instinctively putting my hands up like a barrier. Suddenly, the sounds of flesh tearing stop. Then I watch my car turn off, followed by my garage door’s slow descent, allowing darkness to engulf my garage. My quickening breathing becomes the only audible sound as I become frozen once again. A moment passes before my breathing is accompanied by the creaking of my car and shuffling of fabric. It takes me a second to piece together that the mimic is crawling over my seat to get out. That’s when I hear my car door slam.

I spin around and bolt for the garage door. Miraculously, I find the knob right away and damn near break the door off its hinges as I ram my shoulder into it. I clear the distance between my garage and my house at athletic speed, crashing into the door as I’m unable to stop in time. I frantically pull out my keys and miss the keyhole twice before unlocking the door and stepping inside. I have the door in hand when I turn around and see the mimic standing in the doorway of my garage, facing away from me. I watch it kick into a backwards sprint and then I slam the door and fasten every lock. I hear no further sounds as I back away until I hear Maggie’s hiss behind me. I turn around and faintly see her silhouette with her fur standing on end with her back arched in anger. 

“Get back, Maggie, we’re gonna be okay,” I tell her as I beckon her away with my hand. A loud thud reverberates from the door, making me whip my head back towards it and silencing Maggie’s hissing. A second one erupts from the door, rattling us and the room alike. As the room grows quiet, I pick up an indiscernible sound coming from the thing outside my door. I approached the door with caution and it was only when my ear was hovering above the door that I could make out the sound.

“Let me in, let me in, let me in,” the mimic rapidly repeats with a gleeful ferocity like a hyena approaching its prey. I stumble away as I frantically try to think about what to do when I hear Maggie let out a frightened yowl. I look back and faintly see her cowering behind the leg of a kitchen chair. The sight of her emboldens me as I then face the door and call out with every ounce of paternal energy within me, “I am not letting you in!”

The mimic’s repetition immediately stops. I take a step forward and demand with venom in my voice, “Leave us alone.”

A moment passes and then the laughing begins. The laughter not only comes from beyond the door, but it seems to come from all around the room. I don’t just hear the mimic’s masculine voice, a chorus of various voices joins in, including Ms. Barrett and her children. The laughter continues to crescendo, becoming unbearable, and then it stops. As if whispering right into my ear, I hear the mimic say, “I don’t need your permission to enter.”

A third, splintering thud erupts from the door and it’s evident the door won’t hold much longer. I run to the block of knives and grab the largest one before taking my place in the center of the kitchen. I grip the handle hard enough that the building sweat won’t make it slip out of my hand. My body shakes all over, it practically tries to make me run away, but I need to stand my ground. After all, what use would there be in running to my room, why would a second locked door make any difference? I have to meet this terror right here, especially to keep my little Maggie safe. I briefly look away from the door to see that Maggie has fled to the living room and at that moment, I hear the door swing open and hit the wall. I return my gaze to the open door, still intact as if I had undone the locks myself. The only sign of contact was a large crevice on the outside of the door. I look beyond the open doorway and spot the mimic in the doorway of my garage again. This time, it’s facing me. 

While the backside of Ms. Barrett’s white robe remained pristine, the front had been desecrated with what I horrifyingly assume to be blood. I observe its hands, fingers hooked like talons, are also coated with blood. My eyes flick up to its face and I’m forced to stifle a scream. The mimic had ripped a Cheshire smile onto its rendition of Ms. Barrett’s face. An equally broad grin gleamed from within despite its teeth being stained with gore. As if I have zero depth perception, I watch the mimic take a single step and suddenly it’s in front of me, just before the threshold of the door. It slightly tilts its head to the side before saying, “Momma, no… please don’t… Mommy!”

It spoke with the voices of Ms. Barrett’s children; it hadn’t replicated their voices perfectly but it was enough to make my eyes water.

Those poor children, I think to myself as I wipe my eyes and a searing anger builds within me. I take a step forward and thrust the kitchen knife, aiming for this thing’s center mass. But the blade never makes contact. It’s as if the space between the tip of the blade and the mimic’s chest stretched just enough to not allow contact. I pull the knife back in utter confusion and the mimic chuckles at me with its masculine voice. It then thrusts its arm forward, striking my chest with its palm, and sending me flying backwards. The knife flies out of my hand and my back collides with the edge of the counter, before I smack onto the floor. The wind is knocked completely out of me; I can’t even look up at the monstrosity invading my home. I listen to its bare feet pat against the tiled floor as it walks towards me.

“Those were poor children, indeed. To think the last thing they saw was their mother lunging at them with a mountain lion’s hunger. The same mother that cared and nurtured them also bit into their flesh and suckled marrow from their broken bones.”

It’s now beside me; through blurry vision I watch it crouch and lean close to me.

“I will do the same with you; I’ll wear your face while I eat that little kitten of yours. Then I’ll wait for your roommate to arrive and tear him apart all the same.”

I hear Maggie hiss again and watch the mimic’s face snap in her direction, giggling before licking its lips.

“You won’t get the same mercy the mother got, I’m going to eat this runt of yours in front of you.”

Before I can protest, it lifts me off the floor with one hand and repositions me so I can now see Maggie. Her ears are pointed downward and despite her fear, she remains coiled in the dining room, standing her ground in her own way.

“Please, don’t,” I beg as I grab onto the mimic’s ankle in a feeble attempt to detain it. I hear it laugh as it easily breaks free of my grasp. Then I watch it raise the same foot and feel it stomp onto my head. The sound my head makes against the tiled floor is sickening and I’m left completely disoriented. I’m unable to do anything as the mimic crouches, takes my left hand, and bites into my index and middle finger. My scream is partially muffled to myself as it thrashes back and forth until it successfully detaches my fingers, leaving bloody stumps in their place. I listen to it chew on my fingers for a couple of moments before swallowing, bones and all. While in close proximity to me, I watch the mimic’s features painfully shift as it attempts to replicate my face. The end result is a perverse amalgamation of Ms. Barrett’s face and my own, but just like before, its true eyes remain in place. 

“This will have to do,” it says with a sneer, before rising and turning away from me. I hear it call to Maggie with a sing-song voice, with my voice, as it strolls towards her. Maggie no longer hisses at the mimic; she becomes wide eyed and frozen as that monstrosity looms over her.

“Please run away, please, Maggie,” I sorrowfully beg while all I can do is watch. Just as the mimic is upon her, her eyes leave it and meet mine.

I push myself off of the floor and tear a path at the mimic. It doesn’t react in time and I tackle the mimic to the floor, causing Maggie to flee to the living room. I waste no time as I take a handful of its hair and smash its face into the hardwood floor.

“Stay the fuck away from my cat,” I growl, repeatedly smashing its face in synchrony with every syllable. I finally drop its head, leaving the mimic motionless on the floor as blood pools from its face. I take a step toward the living room and call for Maggie, but I stop when I hear the mimic’s muffled laughter. I hear it peel its head off the floor, so I turn around to see it looking up at me with a big smile on its tattered face. It shoots its hand out, catching my right leg and pulling it to make me fall onto my back. I don’t falter and launch two solid kicks to its face, freeing my right leg of its grasp. I scramble to my feet, grab a chair, and use it like a battering ram against the mimic. I only get it to the doorway that divides my kitchen and dining room when the mimic completely halts my momentum, snatches the chair out of my hands, and flings it aside. Then it simply steps backwards and around the corner, leaving my sight. 

Panic makes me run after it, but it’s nowhere to be found. I back up into the kitchen and quickly retrieve a steak knife from a drawer. A heart aching yowl from Maggie draws my attention and I see her in the clutches of the mimic. She’s desperately trying to wriggle free and claw at its hand, but that thing has its fingers dug into her scruff and held away from its face. The mimic tilts its head slightly downward as it casts a sinister smile at me. Fear and adrenaline course through my veins as I take off in a sprint at it, but my dining room seems to impossibly stretch on and on. I pump my legs faster, stamp my feet harder, but I just can’t seem to reach them. I watch the mimic use its other hand to grab Maggie by her hind legs, positioning her body in front of its mouth. Then the knife flies out of my hand and plunges into the stomach of the mimic. The knife seems to inflict surprise rather than pain as the mimic simply stops to look down at the protruding handle. I finally close the distance, grab onto its shoulder with my left hand, and retrieve the knife with my right. I then feverishly stab into the mimic and continue throughout its torso. I listen to the mimic’s laughter turn into gurgles as blood escapes its mouth. It clamps a hand on my left forearm, almost stabbing its nails into my skin if it weren’t for my fleece jacket, as it tries to pry my hand off of it. In turn, I grip tighter onto its shoulder and continue my assault. I watch its smile turn into a scowl and feel its fingernails turn into claws as they now stab into my left forearm. It clamps its other hand onto my throat and slams me onto the floor, leaving the knife embedded in its chest. I only have my right hand to try to remove its hand from my throat, but it's evident by the mimic’s strength just how fruitless my attempt is.

“Just who do you think you are,” the mimic snarls as it closes its fingers on my throat, making me struggle for air, “You are a fucking worm compared to me. All of you are so far beneath me! And you are becoming annoying to deal with.”

The mimic squeezes harder and I feel the blood vessels in my face near their limits. As the darkness creeps in from the sides of my vision, a shadow suddenly leaps onto the mimic’s face. Maggie has latched onto its face and started her own assault through bites and scratches. The mimic detaches its claws from my left forearm and stabs them into Maggie’s tiny body. She cries out in pain, she cries out to me, and then she is silent. I watch the mimic toss her aside before licking her blood off its claws with delight. My eyes become locked onto her crumpled form for what feels like eternity and then I black out.

 

I’m stirred awake by someone shaking me and I recognize them to be my roommate, Jordan. There’s panic in his voice and fear in his eyes as he tries to get answers out of me, but I give none. I watch him dial into his phone and back away as he likely gets in touch with a 911 operator. My body feels excruciatingly heavy and the numbness I’ve been feeling has now given way to waves of increasing pain. As I try to observe myself and my surroundings, I realize my right eye isn’t working, I’m covered in more blood than I remember, and I’m holding something in my right hand. I’ve been cradling it against my chest and when I pull it away to see what it is, a deep sorrow strikes my heart. It’s Maggie’s lifeless body. I scream out my sobs and tears cascade from my one good eye. Jordan rushes over to witness the source of my agony and joins my mourning. 

Shortly after I’m taken to a hospital where I’m treated for my injuries and the whole thing passes by in a blur. I wake up the next day and I appear like I returned from a warzone. A nurse tells me they all initially thought I was the victim of a wild animal attack, so when they learned I was the result of a home invasion, the shock had been immeasurable.

* **More AniList + MAL integration**: your **lists can now show up as catalogs** inside Stremio.
   * *Important:* you’ll need to **re-install** the addon and **pick your new catalogs**.
* **.SRT subtitle prioritisation** (where available).
   * A small **accessibility improvement** — custom formatting + scaling to make reading/eye movement a bit easier.
* **SUBDL integration**: lets you use **your own API key** to unlock even more subtitle options.
   * **Kitsunekko Subtitles** are integrated into the app as well

*Like with anything, there are bound to be bugs, so please report any that you see!*

And as always, any support is massively appreciated — there’s a *Buy Me a Coffee* link on the addon page:

Christine had fallen asleep on the couch, laptop open on the coffee table in front of her, endless tabs open for university applications for a plethora of different programs — including the requirements that mature students like her would have to meet in order to apply in the first place. Cass spent another half hour after Christine had finally nodded off cleaning up some of the apartment they shared, taking dirty dishes to the sink and washing them, putting away leftover food, and turning the lights off. She pulled a throw blanket that had been tossed onto the floor nearby and draped it over Christine. She leaned forward, placed her forehead against Christine’s for a moment, eyes shut, before moving over to sit on the other end of the couch for a few minutes.

She propped her arm on the armrest of the couch, resting her head on her hand, and couldn’t take her eyes off of the woman next to her. Filming for the movie she’d been cast in was on break for the time being as the director tried to gain more funds, and so Cass found herself back in her old schedule of sleeping mostly during the day and venturing out into Gotham during the nights.

In the time since it was discovered that Felice Viti had been killed, neither Blair nor Harvey were able to deduce anything about where the body had been dumped. They’d told Batman the night before that they’d finally come to the decision to investigate Viti’s home and do their best to get an idea of where his assets lie.

Babs was still teetering on that very thin line between helping Blair as her civilian persona, mild mannered librarian Barbara Gordon, and fully coming out with the truth of being Oracle, Justice Legion associate and tactical command centre for nearly all of the Bat-associated heroes in Gotham and beyond. Cass couldn’t imagine keeping her secret from the woman she loved — but the woman she loved didn’t openly voice her dislike for her secret identity. Cass had encouraged Babs to tell Blair on multiple occasions, but the reveal never came. Blair had, in recent times, come to express that opinion less and less, relying more and more on Batman and Oracle’s help, whether knowingly or not, but it was difficult to tell whether the opinion was changing or simply being suppressed.

There was nothing hidden between her and Christine, and being next to her, in any moment, was always the happiest she’d feel with another person. Her heart was deeply warmed even simply by Christine’s presence. Cass leaned forward slightly, getting a slightly clearer look at Christine’s face, seeing the stray lock of tightly curled hair falling over her cheek. Cass smiled. She liked how Christine’s hair fell around her face when it wasn’t tied back.

It was always light-hearted when they talked about it, but sometimes, in moments where Cass could sit down and just appreciate being next to Christine, she really did find herself wanting to spend a life with this woman. She wanted to do her best to ensure that Christine was happy. Cass couldn’t ask for anything more in life. Life with Christine was happy and simple, her relationship with Barbara was strong, she knew they could rely on each other, being Batman and helping Maps become a hero was fulfilling…

Cass was satisfied.

She spent another twenty minutes sitting on the couch, watching as Christine slept, turning every so often to get more comfortable. An alert on Cass’ phone came from Oracle, in the Belfry.

\*Black Jack just made a move,\* it read. Cass stood up immediately and moved toward the bedroom, where she’d stored the batsuit that morning. She suited up as quickly as she could without making much noise. She exited through the bedroom window, shooting a grapple line up to the roof and zipping up. She stood upon the edge, pulling up the small screen on the wrist of her suit and reading the information that Babs had sent over. Black Jack had been seen on CCTV cameras entering a radio tower controlled by the Gotham Broadcasting Company, over in the Diamond District, on Burnley.

Cass didn’t hear the gunshot that sent a bullet through her cape. It grazed her hip, tearing through the thick, mostly bullet resistant suit easily. She suppressed her instinct to jump from the pain, just as her father had taught her, and lunged down onto the fire escape nearby, hoping that she had been right about the trajectory of the bullet having come from behind her.

“Oracle,” she said, opening the communication line to the Belfry. “Mayfly is out tonight, she just shot me.”

“I saw, your suits diagnostics are warning of an injury,” Barbara replied quickly. “You alright?”

“I am fine,” Cass said, pulling out her grapple gun again. “It’s just a graze, but I am outside Christine’s apartment. I do not want to take any risks. I will try to lose her before going after Black Jack.”

“You want me to call Robin?”

“Not right now,” said Cass. “Not while Mayfly is active. Warn Blair and Dent, too.”

“Will do,” Babs said.

The line dropped to silence. Cass took a deep breath and dropped down the fire escape to the ground. She jogged away from her home, down an adjacent street, utilizing the low ground to keep out of Mayfly’s view until she could grapple up to a row of buildings that were blocked by their neighbours’ height. When she got far enough from her apartment to shoot off into the air for a long glide, she still did so beneath the roofs of the nearby buildings, ready for Mayfly to shoot her down should she rise too high in the sky.

“Did my best to triangulate the shot,” said Babs. “There were some police reports of gunshots in a few different spots in the city, but only two have a good view of Christine’s apartment: one is on the mainland, around Bristol, branching off from Valencia Street. The other is in the Diamond District, atop the Gazette building.”

“You want to guess which one it is?” Batman asked rhetorically.

“If that’s where Black Jack is…” Babs trailed off for a moment. “Lots of straightaways, if that’s where she’s sitting. The bridges over Sprang River are choke points, Cass. Be careful.”

“All I need is to get across,” said Cass. “She just wants to slow me down.”

“What she \*wants\* is to kill you,” Babs said. “The closer you get, the easier you make it for her.”

“And whatever Black Jack is doing, I need to find her,” Cass said, with some sense of finality in her voice as she crossed over Finger River, onto Lee Avenue. She would take the western edge of Somerset island over to Burnley, even though there weren’t any bridges that directly connected the west sides of both islands.

Not a single shot was fired at Cass as she made her way through Somerset, finally reaching the bridge over to Arkham Island. She glided along the west side of the bridge, dipping down below it frequently in an attempt to make herself a moving target. She hoped that, if she was visible, any and all obstructions would stop Mayfly from getting a clean shot.

Touching down on the abandoned Arkham Island, Cass spent the next few minutes making her way over to a small, impromptu Bat-Cave that the first Batman had established years ago. It had been abandoned even before his death, and most of what had been in it had been moved into either another cave or into the Belfry. Luckily for Cass, even despite its abandoned state, it was still an easy way to get onto the island, should the bridges be occupied by criminals like the Joker or be otherwise unusable.

The only other way into the cave was a natural cave system that led right out into the Sprang River. Sitting a few few away from the water line was a personal watercraft with a bat insignia on it, ready to be used. Cass picked up a wire from the ground nearby and plugged it into the watercraft. She waited only a minute before taking it back out, trusting that any latent charge would get her far enough alongside the very brief additional charge.

She hopped on, activated the engine, and sped through the short cave system and out into the river.

All seemed calm until a bullet struck the front of the craft. Cass looked up at the skyline and frowned as she noticed that the Gazette building was no longer visible from where she’d been driving. She looked to her right, westward toward the mainland, and scowled. She twisted the handlebar accelerator with renewed vigour and sped toward the shores of southwest Burnley.

Harvey Dent held his hands behind his head, staring down the barrel of a gun pointed directly at his face. The man holding it was shaky, and he clearly recognized who he was aiming at. He hadn't even bothered with the typical opener of “\*Who the hell are you?\*” He went straight into —

“What the hell are you doing here?”

‘\*Here\*’ was referring to the penthouse of the late Felice Viti. Harvey and Blair had employed some creative means of entering the building, and some less creative means of getting the door to the penthouse itself open. Neither of them anticipated the security within, nor the fact that he was alone in his duties for the night. He wasn’t an amateur by any means, Harvey could see that clearly, but he certainly wasn’t expecting to see any action over the course of the night.

Harvey wasn’t quite sure where Blair had wandered off to, but she clearly wasn’t within the sight of the man holding the gun.

“I had an appointment to meet with the man who lives here,” Harvey said, the first thing that had come to mind. The thug in front of him paused for a moment, shifting his weight quickly, cocking his head.

“So you kick the damned door in?” the man asked. “Don’t test me! Why are you here?”

“I wasn’t… I wasn’t lying,” Harvey replied, looking around the room. “I did have one… a few months ago, but then he disappeared. I wanted to check in and didn’t get an answer.”

“Well, he’s not here,” said the man. “Now turn your ass around and hope I don’t shoot you on your way out.”

The click of a semi-automatic pistol’s safety being turned off broke a momentary silence.

“I wouldn’t do that if I were you,” said Blair, pressing the barrel of her gun to the back of the man’s head. His grip on his own weapon loosened slightly. “Put the gun down and slide it to him.” Slowly, he leaned down, still feeling Blair’s gun to his head as he bent over, and placed the gun on the ground. He used his foot to slide it over to Harvey.

Harvey sighed lightly before leaning down to pick it up. He seemed hesitant even to acknowledge its presence. There was a slight groan as he leaned down to pick it up. In his hands, the weapon seemed at once unfamiliar and yet entirely too comfortable.

“Why are \*you\* here?” Blair asked.

“Just keeping an eye on the place,” he said. “Housesitting.”

“Sure,” Harvey said. “Who are you housesitting for?” he asked, ejecting the magazine from the gun and dismantling it slowly. He was breathing in measured breaths, speaking slowly and with practiced focus.

“Who do you think?” he spat. “Felice fucking Viti.”

“Viti’s dead,” Blair said. “Give us a real answer this time.”

“Well, shit,” he said mockingly. “If the guy’s six feet under then that means my job is done, then, doesn’t it?”

Harvey took a step closer to the man and smiled. The tension in his face hadn’t disappeared quite yet, as he still held pieces of the weapon in hand.

“Come on, now,” he said. “Just tell us what we want to know and it’ll all be over. We don’t want a fight, and I’m sure you don’t either.” The man lifted his head and shut his mouth tightly. “All it takes is a name, maybe a plea deal when we go after Falcone. Again. You know how that turned out last time, don’t you?”

“Falcone’s days are numbered,” Blair added. “And you won’t be seeing any of that pot. Tell us what we need, leave, and wait till everything crumbles. Give us some words to a jury and you’ll have a much easier time.”

“This \*is\* Falcone’s spot,” he said. “What do you wanna know?”

“What happened to Viti?” asked Harvey.

“Sofia offed him,” the man answered quickly. “Wanted the money. Same night as Astrid’s old man. I wasn’t there, but I heard about it. It’s all about the money. Viti told all of us he was runnin’ dry but Sofia knew better. She buried him, had all his shit given to her. Now she’s got it.”

“He funded all of it?” asked Blair.

“Helped,” the man said. “Don’t need him no more. Don’t need Astrid much longer, either.”

“What?”

“She’s cuttin’ the kid loose,” he replied. “Once she’s got what she needs, she’s goin’ six feet under, just like her daddy.”

“And what does Sofia think she needs?” Harvey asked, tossing the disassembled gun parts down onto a nearby table. Something in his shoulders released, as if unburdened by a great weight. He looked at the thug with curiosity and confusion.

“Total control of the city,” he said with a smile. “She’s almost there, man. All she needs is the mayor and the DA… Everyone else is expendable or bought. Councilmen, lawyers, banks, chamber of commerce, all of ‘em.”

Harvey looked at Blair.

“A lot more than I thought,” said Harvey.

“Damn right!” the thug said, before attempting to lunge at Harvey despite the gun to the back of his head. Harvey moved out of the way of the flying fist and stepped away, allowing Blair to step in and throw her own heavy strike at the man’s face, knocking him out cold.

“Dammit!” Blair shouted. “Is everyone in this damned city dirty?”

“Only the ones in power,” said Harvey. “Just like anywhere else. And if they’re not, it’s only ‘cause nobody’s gotten to them yet.”

“Were you?” asked Blair, breathing heavily. “In your time? Before… you know…”

“I tried not to be,” Harvey replied. “But I worked with Batman, and he did stuff like this.” Blair scrunched her nose.

“Shit,” she muttered. “Come on. We probably got what we needed for now. No way he gets up peacefully and lets us look around.”

“Good idea,” Harvey said. “I’m gonna make myself scarce over the next few days anyway, once Sofia hears I’m involved.”

“Smart.”

Cass felt some semblance of luck as she zipped up toward the top floor of the Gotham Broadcast Company’s headquarters on her grapple line, smashing through the window with ease. She rolled to her feet and lunged forward. Black Jack was standing by a maintenance panel that connected directly to the radio tower above the building. As the window shattered, she turned her head, shocked, toward Cass. She had barely been able to stand from her kneeling position before being tackled to the ground.

“Mayfly!” she commanded. It took a few seconds, but as Cass grappled Black Jack to the ground, a bullet flew into the room, and into the wall next to Cass. She looked over at the impact, then in the opposite direction. Her eyes widened for a moment, seeing a figure rappelling on the side of the GBC building with a large rifle in hand. Within that second, all of Cass’ theories regarding Maylfy had disappeared.

Her helmet seemed to function as one large targeting screen, encapsulating the entirety of her upper face, from her nose upward, while her tactical suit easily would have blended with the buildings of Gotham. She was a pale woman, more pale than Cass had seen in a person, with dark lipstick sharply contrasting her alabaster skin.

Cass hooked her arm around Black Jack’s neck and shifted into a roll toward Mayfly. She finished off, having dragged Black Jack with her in the roll, positioning herself behind the mercenary. In front of her, Black Jack was now in a sitting position, legs forward, facing Mayfly. Cass took cover behind her.

“Why are you here?” asked Cass.

“Taking over,” said Black Jack. “Giving Astrid an in.”

“An in for what?”

“Broadcasts of all kinds,” said Black Jack. “I’m not the only one. Killshot is on the mainland tuning her into other stations, same with Cormorant and Ezra. Thanks for taking Constantine out of action, by the way. He got on my nerves.”

“My pleasure,” Cass replied. “What is stopping me from doing the same to you?”

“The fact that it's not my combat expertise that Astrid needs.” Black Jack smiled and lifted her hands behind her head. “Even if you break all my bones, it’s my mind that’s important, and you’re not a killer. I’d say the others are on the way, but this’ll be over before they get here.”

“And what about Mayfly?” asked Cass.

“You move out from behind me even an inch, and your brains are all over that panel I’ve been messing with,” Black Jack said. “You can’t get away from her now.”

“We will see about that,” Cass said, grabbing a handful of Black Jack’s clothes and yanking her up to her feet. She began walking toward the window that Mayfly was hanging in front of. Mayfly seemingly furrowed her brow, beneath her mask, and shifted her grip on her rifle.

“I’m sure we will,” Black Jack said, trying and failing to gain leverage on Cass as she struggled against her grip. “You’re outmatched, Batman. You can’t take all of us at once and it’s pointless to try. All we need is to catch you off guard again and you’re nothing.”

“Good luck with that.”

“The Order of Arkham will end you, Batman!” Black Jack shouted as they reached the window. Mayfly stopped aiming down her scope and, with a curious expression, watched Cass intently. She pressed Black Jack against the glass for a moment.

“I am sure you will,” Cass said, an explicit lack of interest in her voice. She pulled Black Jack’s head back quickly and watched the expression on Mayfly’s face shift from confusion to fear as she pressed a button on her belt, causing the line she was hanging from to zip upward sharply and bring her out of view. Black Jack’s head hit the window hard. A large spider web-like crack stretched across the surface, threatening to shatter and send glass shards tumbling down to the street below.

Cass let Black Jack fall to the ground, writhing in pain, as she turned around and walked back toward the panel she’d been fiddling with. There were multiple new devices clearly jury-rigged to the panel, most of which Cass had no interest in finding out the function for.

She grabbed onto each of them and pried them off the panel, tossing them down onto the ground to be stomped on.

Behind her, Black Jack slowly rose to her feet. Cass scowled.

She pulled the grapple gun from her belt and aimed it at the ground just in front of Black Jack, pulling the trigger and letting the gun zip her forward. Grabbing another hook line from her belt mid-flight, she held it in hand as she crashed into Black Jack, knee to the woman’s chest, and hooked the extra line into Black Jack’s belt with perfect timing — of which she otherwise could not allow herself to miss.

The impact sent Black Jack hurtling through the cracked window behind her. Cass stood where Black had been only a second before as she watched the hired mercenary fly out of the window and fall the length of the extra line Cass had attached to her before coming to a stop. For the rest of the night, until the police had come to retrieve her, Black Jack hung, upside down, outside of the Gotham Broadcast Company’s main radio tower.

Her efforts had been thwarted by Batman summarily destroying all of her equipment.

Mayfly had left the scene long before Batman had a chance to go searching for her.

1qk7bxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/1qk7bxj/devicebased_educationgrowing_up_in_the_90s/,Device-based education/growing up in the 90s.,"*I want to start by saying that I am about to have a whinge of sorts, but there's a story to it, so keep reading if you're intrigued*

I was watching some reels on YouTube this morning while having a coffee, and came across this good-vibes little video of a guy walking around his high-school on the last day with a camcorder, saying goodbye to everyone and capturing their reactions.

The video was clearly taken in the 90s, and not only did everyone appear happy and healthy, they were all working with pen and paper. It got me thinking before I even saw the comments, but regardless, one of the comments said something along the lines of ""I grew up in the 90s, it was the last great decade"". It had a lot of positive response but also people saying things like ""everyone says that about their generation"" etc..

*As someone who was born in 1998 and had a very brief taste of growing up the ""old school"" way, before internet devices and social media became mainstream and f*cked everyone, I have something to say in regards to ""90s being the last great generation"".*

**I completely and utterly agree**

(Let me start by saying I proudly associate myself with being a ""90s kid"" mainly because the year I was born in was 1998, and I'm well aware that I didn't ""grow up"" in the 90s but I just prefer the sound and vibe of being a 90s kid so that's where I'll choose to stay if I have a choice.)

I remember having to figure out how to keep myself entertained, how to keep my mind occupied with physical things rather than resorting to scrolling. I remember learning with pen and paper at school, learning out of workbooks. I remember going to the library and reading books. I remember going to the skate park and going to the leisure centre/pools. I remember trespassing on school property on the weekend as a kid to play on the playground with mates, and loitering around the mall. I remember sending texts with the phone in my pocket, knowing how many button presses generated which letter, and of course texting in short ""r u ok m8"" and ""wht time u cmng ova"" (I've still got my Nokia 1600). I remember being fascinated with basic things like spelling ""boobies"" and ""shell oil"" upside down on a calculator and showing it to classmates even though we've all seen it before. I remember msn messenger, I remember myspace, and I remember when Facebook became a thing.

*And then I remember when Orewa College became the first school in New Zealand to introduce mandatory device-based learning.* **I was studying at Orewa College at the time.**

We are going back over a decade now and my memory isn't so flush but iirc, my year (9 or 10 at the time) was the ""trial year"", and after that year they made it mandatory throughout the whole school, with many schools in NZ to follow suit.

I think, and still think, that was a terrible decision. *""We are making it easier for students to access information, have immediate access to learning wherever they are, and cut down less trees"".* Yeah, but you also just placed Facebook, Minecraft, and 8 Ball Pool right in front of every kids face and expected them to only do work while at school, we were kids.. *""We have added network restrictions and watchdogs so they can't access social media or gaming services while at school"".* Yeah, but we grew up on this sh!t, and it didn't take long to figure out that using a VPN immediately gave us access to everything and there was nothing you could do about it.

Too late to go back though, they had already changed the curriculum, and were trying to set an example. What I think they really achieved was making an already growing problem occur at a far faster pace than it would have, had it happened only outside of school. I KNOW by this point and time we all had phones in our pockets that could do all the same things a computer or tablet could do, the difference is we were now allowed to use a device ALL DAY while at school, who's idea was that?

It was easy to hide your activities on a laptop, but because it was trendy to have an iPad, most kids did, and once jailbroken (which about 50% of kids iPads were, there were kids at school selling the service) three presses of the home button could swap between your gaming/Facebook screen and take you back to the learning screen, with no hint or trace of anything else happening. This change took about half a second to execute, the teachers thought they were on to us, trying to sneak behind us to see what we were doing on the screens, lol, good luck with that. Half of us were running modified devices with undetectable services and unlimited access to the internet...

I refused to bring a device to school for quite some time, I preferred learning with pen and paper. I used to be quite disruptive and was far more fascinated with what was happening outside the classroom, so most of the teachers (against the rules) allowed me to wear earphones in class, because when I listened to music I would shut up and start doing schoolwork. That was me, happy as larry, no Facebook, no Minecraft, just pen & paper with a bit of music sprinkled on top. I didn't mind the other kids calling my family ""broke"" or calling me a loser for not having a device - I had two laptops at the time, I just chose not to bring them to school.

Then the impositions started happening, and then the detentions. Why? Because I wasn't bringing a device to school. They even gave me a little laptop to use, and I still refused to use it. I voiced my concerns to my dean, and without being a snitch, told her what was happening on everyone's devices and that I didn't want to be a part of it. Her response: ""we know, and there's nothing we can do about it. I don't like it either, but this is what we are doing now""... Eventually, I had no choice, I was forced to use a device with the threat of stand-downs and/or being expelled in time if I didn't comply. Just think about that for a minute: as a kid, I tried to maintain my current workflow to avoid distractions, and was forced otherwise, by adults.

That pretty much sealed the deal from then onwards. In two years we went from kids occasionally passing notes in class, to messaging each other non stop and gaming instead of doing school work. They may as well have removed the teacher from the classroom, put arcade machines in there, and said ""just do the school work when you feel like it""... I'm not sure if they've corrected this issue since, I doubt they have, but they definitely hadn't by the time I left. 

I used to enjoy school! I had career goals of being an international airline pilot; I was focusing on English, maths, and physics, so I could join the Air Force and get my pilots licence through them, get some cool experience and discipline, then progress, eventually becoming a Captain for a company like Air NZ or Quantas.. But I eventually went back to being disruptive since I was pissed off about being forced to use a device and simply could not stay engaged, also due to the fact that once all the other kids started wearing headphones they cracked down on it, and they took away the only thing that kept me focused because ""it's not fair on the other kids"".

In due course, I was getting impositions for not doing school work, and of course I wasn't doing those either, so that led to detentions, and after so many detentions I was given internal stand-downs, and after so many internal stand-downs, they decided to keep me in the office permanently. At this time I had been on internal standdown for around 4 weeks straight, I went home and told mum there was nothing left for me at school anymore, that I was going to drop out and get a job at a local mechanic shop. She replied: ""good, I'll come with you"", as she was just as pissed as I was, and that was the end of that.. I quit smoking weed at 20, and at ~24 I realized that I need to make a change to get back on track and start actually creating a career for myself, in the hopes of becoming what I thought I was going to be (successful). I've been playing catch up ever since, and am nowhere near being where I could have been, nor where I currently aspire to be. I've also been depressed since ~2022.

Now I definitely made my own bad decisions along the way, I'm not blaming the system entirely, smoking weed didn't help, and as an adult I was eventually diagnosed with ADHD which explains the lack of attention to schoolwork and the necessity to be distracted (music) to focus, it's the same thing now, but **I feel like the introduction of mandatory device-based learning was the end of my schooling.** How can you expect kids to not get distracted on a device when there are cool things like Facebook, Minecraft or 8 Ball Pool on it? And why wouldn't you just let the kids who wanted to stay on pen & paper just remain on pen & paper, especially if they are voicing concerns about their future? I know I wasn't the only one who wanted to stay away from the devices at school, there weren't many of us but I definitely wasn't the ""odd one out"".

*(I'm not going to get into the subsequent conversation regarding how social media has impacted the youth because everyone already knows this, and yes, it impacted me too, still does)*

Keeping all of this in mind; if we go back 2 hours ago when I started writing this, when I came across that high school video from the 90s, where everyone is happy, smiling, using pen and paper, with a comment saying ""90s was the last great generation"", as someone who wishes they were born just a few years earlier and feels like their life f*ck ups were greatly attributed to the addition of social media and device-based learning - **yes, I definitely agree that the 90s was the last great generation.** I am greatful that I got a taste but pissed off that I didn't get to taste it for long enough. I'm 28 years old.

A lot of things going on here.  We always friendly with one another, but back in September or October, I could feel things shifting between us.  What became apparent is that we communicate extremely well with one another, share the same sense of humor, and both have been through some really traumatic things that brought us together.

Over the past couple months, we’ve shred more and more details about our lives, the friendly banter has picked up, and I even had two co-workers asking me if there was something going on or what I thought about her.  I just brushed the questions off and didn’t give clear answers, but I found that other people were seeing this even when we have limited interactions with each other.

I always knew there was some type of age gap, but I didn’t know what it was.  Her life experience has always made her seem older than she is.  The age gap always made me unsure if what I was feeling was real interest or if it was something else.

Anyway, one day she was trying to guess how old I was.  The first number out of her mouth was 29.  It took her a long time to get to 40, and she never would’ve got there if I didn’t tell her.  Our personalities match so well together, and it’s the main reason I’m considering this.

The thing I found interesting interesting after that was she started giving me a lot of physical compliments over the next week or two.  Nothing was weird after and all the same attraction signals were still there.

Additional context:  to complicate matters even more, she has a daughter who is 1.5 years old.

I actually asked her if she’d like to grab coffee but to chat outside work.  I’m not even looking to start something any time soon, but basically what I’m trying to see if the interest might be mutual.

I’ve dated a co-worker in the past, and while it might’ve felt weird at first, ultimately it was fine.  The age gap doesn’t seem to bother her (at least as far as I know).

I’ve dated women with a kid.  I’m ready for why that means if it gets there.  Perhaps she sees me as someone who can be mature about the situation and be patient?

He's about to move in with his gf and I feel like I should warn her about what he's actually like so she doesnt make the mistake of living with him.

Okay so I (32f) have been having an issue with my roommate, lets call him Joe (35m). We moved in together last year as we were both looking for a pet friendly home (I have cats and a dog, he has an extra large breed dog) and since we had be friends for a while figured it was a good idea. We were supposed to split housework evenly but so far that hasnt happened. When it's his turn to do dishes he puts dirty dishes back into the cabinet for me to find (he claims he ""doesn't see it"", despite me talking to him about it no less than 3 times a week for the last 11 months), in the last 11 months he's cleaned the bathroom a whopping total of 5 times, and each time I had to go back and reclean the sink, toilet, mirror, and shower because they were not done and were still visibly dirty, and that was after 3 weeks of me asking him to please clean the bathroom each time. I work from home but he doesn't so he's supposed to be the one to take the garbage to the bins (I take it out of the garbage can and replace the bag, leaving it tied by the front door where he asks me to so it's easier to grab on his way to work) but he will leave it sitting there for days and then when our dogs get into it guess who has to clean up the mess? Me. He's also broken my vacuum (he let it fall down the stairs and the power button broke off) and his response was ""well it was an accident so it's fine"", no offer to replace it or anything, it's a $300 vacuum I got to help with pet hair (my dog sheds a TON in the spring/fall so I need a good vacuum), he's also destroyed several kitchen things of mine (my food processor, several collectible coffee mugs and plates) again with no offer to replace them. He's theoretically also supposed to clean out the fridge but in 11 months he's done it 3 times, and each time he left almost all the moldy food and expired stuff in there saying ""idk if you could use it"" or actually ya know, cleaning the fridge by taking hot water and a cleaner and CLEANING THE INSIDE OF THE FRIDGE. Over the last year I have tried talking to him, creating a chore chart, giving him a list of things that need to be done around the house, when he claimed his mother never taught him how to clean a house I sent him links to a youtube channel that teaches you how to clean everything and anything. I still get left doing 99.99% of the housework because I refuse to live in a dirty home. I also pay the vast majority of the rent, our rent is $1850 a month, plus utilities and internet, I pay $1000 and he pays $850, and nothing towards utilities. This was not how it was presented to me when we were talking about moving in together but he expects the $850 to cover everything but food which leaves me paying $200-$400 a month in utilities on top of rent. By the time this was made clear to me we'd already signed the lease and moved in, and I did not have the money to break my lease and move a second time.

Now I was ready to just not resign the lease and move to a place on my own again when the lease is up at the end of next month, but now I found out he wants to move in with his gf (30sf) who has a disabled child (7m) and a high energy dog (its a Malinois mix). I want to warn her that he will only make her life harder since all he does is go to work then sit on his lazy ass gaming leaving all the housework to me. I have tried talking to him about this at least 100 times in the last year, we've had a few actual screaming matches about it as well. I think she deserves to know he's a useless man child before she makes the mistake of moving him in. So would I be the asshole for telling her?



EDITED: I forgot to add something about his dog. When we moved in together I noticed my couch was starting to stink in a weird way and I'd been having to steam clean it more frequently (I used to do it every other month because I do let our pets sleep on the couch but now I was having to every 3 weeks because otherwise you can smell the filth from his dog when you sit on the couch), he told me that's because his dog has NEVER had a bath. His excuse is when he tries it stresses her out too much, but the problem is she FEELS dirty, and the stench coming off her is disgusting. I've tried encouraging him to bathe her and offered a doggy cologne as a temporary solution, but he just doesnt care about this dog enough to bathe it. ",10,1769116981.0,badroommates,33,0.86,False

Haven’t done any weight loss meds before this. Here’s my day to day break down. I’ve taken it every morning right when I wake up and don’t eat/drink for a solid 45 mins. I have not changed my caffeine intake (2-3 cups a day) and still take my other daily medication (Vyvanse, pristiq, and lamictal). I get about 5k steps a day and work out about 2x a week. I work a super intense 24/7ish type of job so I’m not as active as I want to be. 

Breakdown from 1 week:

Day 1 - 3 didn’t feel much. 

Day 3 started to feel some appetite suppression and a bit of fullness after a smaller sized meal

Day 4 the appetite suppression and fullness was more apparent

Day 5 more apparent than previous day

Day 6 more apparent than previous day and a lottttt of gas cramps. The gas doesn’t smell bad. According to my research this is common in the first week since digestion is slowing down. 

Day 7 eating significantly smaller portions and feeling full. Trying my best to eat protein. Gas is still painful and I feel so bloated!

Eating patterns: from day 4 on, I’ve pretty much eaten the same thing (banana, coffee, sandwich with meat, plain dinner like pasta) and haven’t felt hungry. If anything it’s taken effort to actually get myself to eat. 

Side effects:

Gas, bloating, and had 1 or 2 headaches

1qk76ir,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoHangoutFriends/comments/1qk76ir/helping_an_introverted_friend_make_friends_in/,helping an introverted friend make friends in toronto,"hi all, i’m 23F and i have a friend (29M) who’s been in toronto, specifically harborfront, for almost two years and still hasn’t really found his people. we’re good friends, but i live far, and aside from me he doesn’t really have anyone to talk to or hang out with. he spent the holidays alone, most weekends alone, pretty much everything solo.

he’s introverted and takes time to warm up, but once he’s comfortable he’s genuinely easy to talk to. he also doesn’t really have hobbies right now, but he’s very open to learning or trying new things if he’s with the right people. i sometimes drag him along to try some of mine, but like i mentioned, my circle and area are pretty far from him.

if anyone wants to connect with us/him or adopt us into a club, group, or regular hangout, WE’RE down. coffee, dinner, library hangs, movie nights, anything really. i’m happy to help set up a small meetup.

a bit about us:

\- he goes to the gym, likes movies, and recently got into reading

\- i’m into combat sports (especially muay thai), movies, live music, cooking/baking, reading, journaling, dancing, and many more

dm me if you want more details. pleaseeeee i’m deadass, he needs friends 🥹",3,1769116863.0,TorontoHangoutFriends,5,1.0,False

1qk74z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1qk74z7/how_to_navigate_this_weird_reality_with_my/,How to navigate this weird reality with my husband? Communication is failing fast.,"My husband (50M) and I (45F) have been married 20 years with 4 kids at home. Life has been stressful with work issues, financial strain, and the normal chaos of raising a family. I think he’s dealing with depression and situational anxiety, he cycles between sad, energized, or angry, and only seems genuinely happy when he’s with friends or had a great day at work. Otherwise he walks around like the world is on his shoulders. I’ve struggled too, after years of pouring everything into work and being the default parent (not necessarily a negative, this was always my role and we both leaned into that for a lot of years).

A couple years ago he got quite angry with me and told me I was obviously depressed and should get help after I couldn't answer his peppering questions about what I wanted. I did, and I wasn’t depressed, just overwhelmed and unsure of my next steps in life. As a mom we forget ourselves sometimes. iykyk. We agreed, after a therapist told us we have to end work talk after a certain time because it was hurting our relationship talking about it all of the time. It helped for a while, we reconnected, intimacy improved, and things felt lighter.

But when I went back to school as we agreed would be a great next step for us, he felt cut off from me because I wasn’t involved in work anymore and we weren’t supposed to talk about it outside work hours. He says he has no one to talk to, and when he brings things up he wants instant responses that I just can’t give. I need a minute to process or even get into that same headspace, and he gets angry, says we “can’t communicate,” and shuts down. I know I’ve been working hard on our relationship and his needs and my own, but he recently told me things are “worse than ever,” which crushed me.

Today I mentioned our son wanted to go to an event this weekend. I had only just gotten the details myself, but he blew up, saying I always dump things on him last minute so he has to be the “bad guy.” He insists I leave him out of decisions and only involve him when I want him to say no. That isn’t true, I didn't want him to say no. I just got the details and I want him involved, especially as the kids get older, but he refuses to use the school/team apps and then gets upset when he’s out of the loop. I know I messed up the other day when I told a family member I had to talk with him about a favor, but I implied it would be okay. I honestly thought it would be okay, but he blew up about it and said no way no how and how would I think that was okay and I am always making him out to be the bad guy. I know I messed up and I apologised for doing that, it wasn't my intention to hurt him or come across that way but I get why he felt like that and why he's spiraling about it.

Every conversation turns into him saying I attack him, that we have nothing to talk about once the kids are gone, that he’s alone, that he shoulders everything. Meanwhile, he forgets things I ask him to do, like pick up a kid so I can go to a doctor's appointment or take out the garbage or check my oil light, doesn’t apologize, and I’ve spent years taking on most of the home and family load (including the inlaws in our home) because I didn’t want to add to his stress. It just irritates me so much that I can't count on him, I just can't and if I bring it up that he told me he would do something and he didn't (not that I feel I can't count on him because that would cause a war) he says that all he does is for the family and he has sacrificed everything and I make him out to be such a bad guy and he doesn't deserve that. So I stop talking because that's too much. Now again he is saying he wants more from me, more intimacy, more connection, but also that I wouldn’t choose him again which feels like he's projecting :(

He has hobbies that help him cope, and he wants me to join, but they’re not really my thing and he gets irritated if I don’t take them as seriously as he does. I support him, we talk about it a lot, I just don’t always participate because I don't want to be told what and how to do it right. That's not really fun for me and I'm not that into TV sports which is his other thing. So now I don't want to spend time with him apparently and that all he wants is a couple of minutes. Like he went to pick up something at our youngest's bedtime and wanted me to go for the drive, he was leaving right then as I was sitting on the couch reading with our kid. Again, this instant decision thing. I didn't respond right away and just looked up at him so instantly he said forget it it's fine and left. Later he said It was just some time to be together and chat, that's all he wants. When I said I was putting a kid to bed, he said it's fine and he gets that he isn't important enough, OMG eye roll WTF. What should I say when he asks me something? Maybe just okay, give me a second to process that because I'm thinking of all the things I can do to make that happen, he is mad because I am not jumping off the couch right that second. 

I’m trying, but he’s unhappy and I’m failing him and myself and this marriage. How do I communicate with him? I feel like I have tried all the things, told him all the truths to connect as partners, did the submission thing, did the stand up for myself thing, did the therapy thing, did the list thing, the games thing, told him I need this, told him I hear that, always ask him what he needs, told him I know he processes immediately while I need time, and he just keeps getting frustrated with me. 

I don't know if it's depression or he just really isn't happy with me and doesn't like me that much. If he isn't happy with me then maybe he should just leave, like I really really don't want him to leave but I also don't want him to find more and more ways that I don't meet his needs in life. I don't think anyone should go through life this unhappy and I certainly don't want to be the cause of someone's unhappiness, especially my partner in life. At some point I have to stop defending myself, and I already tried admitting being a bag of shit so that didn't work in the lowest time of my self esteem either. Funny, he didn't disagree just said I was being too hard on myself at the time. I really think I am growing as a person and a wife and a mother, but he absolutely doesn't agree and what do I do with that? It makes me freeze, like I can't even concentrate on school thinking that decision was all a big mistake. He is so unsatisfied, and my job as his wife is to support him and help him so this is a fail. I just don't know what my next step is because it's getting worse every time we talk. We went for coffee yesterday just to spend time and I asked him VERY lightly about a comment he made the day before (coincidentally it was made at the same time I asked him to do something he would do for me that he did not do). I said ""Oh I wanted to ask you about (that thing) you said yesterday because I was thinking about the plans today and remembered you said (this). So I was wondering if you just said it or it's something we should talk about or...?"" He went on about how he can't say anything without me losing sleep over it and asked how he can talk or say things so that I don't think the world is falling down, he just it, it didn't mean anything. I was like hold on now, I didn't say I was losing sleep, I just asked if this was something we should talk about or if it was just a passing no issue comment. 

Let's make one thing clear before I sign off, I have shut down in the past, he is an aggressive communicator and for a long time I just let him talk and then agreed. I have been stressed about our future and have to think about things and don't tend to match his energy very well these days. I get frustrated and scared about how stupid I was not to have my own security, and I have let him shoulder the brunt of the work issues even though we decided that was best for the marriage and the family. I do not pretend to act properly all of the time, give him enough attention or communicate enough. I sometimes do before I think to talk with him and give him the cold shoulder when he pisses me off or talks in circles. I am not the perfect wife, but I have been working to improve our future...I thought anyway. Please help me. I go from fuck this, to I'm a failure regularly. 

tl;dr I think my husband is depressed because I don't give him enough. I think I am making him frustrated with my actions or inactions and I don't know what to do next.

1qk73db,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qk73db/help_me/,Help me :'(,"Hello, how are you? I hope your day is full of happiness and comfort.
I’m the oldest sister in my family. I’m 25 years old. My middle sister is 23, and my youngest sister is 16.
In my country, there’s a culture that the oldest girl should get married first. If she doesn’t, people start making rumors about her, like saying she didn’t get married because she’s mentally or physically sick, ugly, or autistic.
For me, I don’t want to get married right now. Two people proposed to me and I rejected them because of their personality, their families, and also because I don’t want marriage at this stage. I want to build myself, get a job, and enjoy my time because my childhood was kind of bad.
Last year, someone proposed to my middle sister. I felt my mom was hesitant, so I told my sisters and my mom that I have no problem at all if my sisters get married before me. Actually, I’d be happy for them. I don’t want them to stop their lives because of me. I don’t want to get married now, maybe later, and I’m totally okay with that. Even though inside I worry about people’s talk, I would never say anything or ruin things for them. That’s not their fault.
Everything was fine. I was excited and also sad because I’d be separated from my sister. You know how the oldest sister feels. Even though my middle sister can be harsh with her words sometimes, I still love her, and I love my younger sister too.
We started preparing and everything was normal. During that time, I started buying things like drawing tools and crochet stuff. I also made a workout schedule to discover my hobbies and enjoy my time. Everything felt normal.
But from last month until now, my middle sister started acting rude to me for no clear reason. Sometimes literally for no reason.
For example, today she got mad because I didn’t make food for her with me while I was cooking. I was sick and got dizzy, so I canceled the cooking in the middle and ordered food instead, and I did include her. Even though we were already arguing, she ignored me the rest of the day and cooked for herself.
I still love her, and I wasn’t that upset.
At night, I went to talk to her about something that happened, and she said, “How are you talking to me like you didn’t do anything?” I laughed because she always says this and makes things bigger, even though most of the time she’s the one in the wrong. I took it as a joke and laughed with her because she’s my sister, and these things happen between sisters.
A few hours later, I saw a TikTok video about “how sisters treat their married sister.” It was about treating her like a guest in an extra way, and it was funny. I showed it to her and said, “Me and my younger sister (let’s call her Sara) will do this to you before you come. We’ll make dessert, coffee, and juice, and you won’t be allowed to check our house.” My younger sister was listening and laughing.
Suddenly, my middle sister got angry and said, “You know what I’ll do? I won’t invite you to my wedding because you’ll envy me since I’m getting married and you’re not. I’m also scared you’ll steal my husband from me, so I’ll make you get dressed and sit at home.” While she was talking, I told her, “Why are you saying this? That’s not okay,” and I was angry.
She ignored me and continued, “I’ll make you get dressed and stay at home so you don’t come, envy me, and take my husband. Ew,” and she laughed.
I told her her words were very rude and that I was just joking and only meant the video. I asked her if she really thinks there’s something wrong, and she said, “I was joking too,” with an annoying look while laughing.
I was really hurt. I have never said anything to hurt her or disrespect her. I don’t understand why she acts like this. My heart really broke, and I went alone and cried because I love my sisters. Even my younger sister told me I didn’t say anything wrong and that my middle sister really exaggerated and has been rude to me for a long time.
I know some of you might think I’m weak or stupid because I cried and now I’m writing this while I’m sad. I just want to understand why my sister did this. Was my joke rude or hurtful? I really want to understand the reason.",0,1769116663.0,Advice,1,0.5,False

In de kelder van een flat in Hanevoet bewijst De Slappe Band dat fietsen maken om meer gaat dan alleen kettingen en tandwielen—het gaat om de mensen. Deze unieke werkplaats tovert ""weesfietsen"" van het TU/e-terrein om tot gerecyclede pareltjes, maar de echte kracht zit in de sfeer.
Als stressvrije werkplaats zijn er geen targets of deadlines. Het is een veilige plek voor deelnemers die een normale baan als te druk ervaren. Zoals een van de vrijwilligers uitlegt:
""Als mijn 'emmertje' vol is, kan ik gewoon even thee gaan drinken. Er zit verder geen druk achter, want er hoeft niks af.""
Voor velen is het een belangrijke reden om op te staan. In plaats van thuis te zitten, hebben ze hier een doel, sociale contacten en—misschien wel het belangrijkste—""de koffie en de koekjes.""

In the basement of a Hanevoet flat, De Slappe Band is proving that bike repair is about more than just gears and chains—it’s about people. This unique workshop turns ""orphan bikes"" from the TU/e terrain into recycled gems, but the real magic is the atmosphere.

As a ""stress-free"" workplace, there are no targets or deadlines. It’s a sanctuary for participants who find traditional jobs overwhelming. As one volunteer explains:

\> ""If my 'bucket' is full, I can just sit down and have a tea. There’s no pressure because nothing 'has' to be finished.""

\> 

For many, it’s a vital reason to get moving. Instead of sitting at home, they have a community, a purpose, and—most importantly—""the coffee and the cookies.""

Let's be real: that store-bought frother is a one-trick pony. You want café-quality lattes, cappuccinos, and iced coffees at home, but you're stuck with a machine that only handles one type of pod or, worse, just makes hot milk. What if you could ditch the clutter and unlock endless coffee possibilities with just one smart device? Enter HiBREW, the game-changer for home baristas.

We've all been there – you love your Nespresso, but a friend brings K-Cups, or you're craving a specialty drink that needs ground coffee. HiBREW's brilliance lies in its **universal compatibility**. Forget buying multiple gadgets; HiBREW machines are the ultimate all-in-one solution.

Here's why HiBREW is the smart choice:

*   **Pod Freedom:** Brew with K-Cups, Nespresso capsules, Dolce Gusto pods, or your favorite ground coffee – all from a single, sleek machine.
*   **True Espresso Power:** Don't settle for weak coffee. HiBREW's **19-bar high-pressure extraction** delivers rich, authentic espresso every time, the foundation of any great latte or cappuccino.
*   **Hot & Cold Versatility:** Craving a refreshing iced coffee on a hot day? Or a steaming hot latte? HiBREW handles both, giving you the flexibility for any season or mood.

Stop sacrificing convenience for quality or paying premium prices for limited functionality. HiBREW offers high-end features, like precise temperature control and fast brewing, at a fraction of the cost of traditional brands. It’s the perfect way to elevate your morning ritual or impress guests without the counter-clutter.

It feels native to Reddit and not like a hard sell, while still incorporating the requested link and calls to action.

## I Tried Copying a $1,200 Designer Table Using Basic Tools—Here’s What Happened.

I’ll be real with you — I’ve always admired those sleek, minimal designer pieces, especially the kind with price tags that make your stomach drop.  

So when I came across a $1,200 walnut-and-steel coffee table online, I thought: _“How hard could it be to make a similar one for under a hundred bucks?”_

Cue the chaos.

I started with basic tools: an old circular saw, a hand sander, and a folding workbench that wobbles worse than my confidence during math tests. I sketched the design, ran to the lumberyard, and set mid-level expectations.

The first few cuts? Crooked.  
The joints? Loose enough to host a summer breeze.  
And at one point, I glued my glove to the tabletop (lesson learned: wood glue and Instagramming don’t mix).

But something surprising happened after the frustration faded. I realized how forgiving woodwork can be — not to our mistakes, but to our determination. Little by little, I corrected. Re-cut edges. Sanded more carefully. Measured twice (actually, three times).  

By the end of the weekend, that “designer” table wasn’t perfect, but it was _mine_. It didn’t look like the $1,200 version — but I’d argue it told a better story.

Here’s what I learned:
- **Technique beats tools.** Hand-sanding might feel medieval, but a steady hand can outshine a $500 sander.
- **Planning saves materials.** Every rushed measurement costs you hours later.
- **Simple, strong joints over complex, weak ones.**
- And most of all — wood doesn’t fight you; it mirrors your patience.

Those lessons changed how I build. And if you’ve been stuck in that “why don’t my projects ever turn out right?” loop, I’ve got something to share that actually helps.

👉 Check this out: [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Woodworking](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Woodworking)

It’s a woodworking course built for everyday people — not master carpenters with full workshops. It breaks down the fundamentals (like stronger joints, cleaner cuts, and better finishing) in ways that actually make sense.  

Plus there’s a huge woodworking giveaway running right now — thought I’d share for anyone serious about improving their builds:

If woodworking ever left you frustrated — if you’ve watched your “dream project” end up as kindling — please, take a few minutes to read through it.  

Because the truth is, the difference between failure and pride isn’t skill — it’s knowing the right steps and practicing the fundamentals first.

Good morning/afternoon/evening/whenever this post may find you, and may it find you well! Title is cheesy, I know. But it's who I am, and I'm tired of feeling like I have to tone myself down in order to get into a relationship. I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text.

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are...

* 24-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this, more inclined to go higher than lower)
* Childfree (non-negotiable)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous
* Cis AFAB woman. Very sorry to my AFAB enbies and trans girlies (and AMAB enbies and trans guys for that matter), love ya, I will always be an ally in the fight to be who you are without fear but y'all are just not for me romantically speaking.

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* Location (doesn't have to be precise but I'd at least like what state you're in currently)
* What about my post stood out to you and made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1. blue cheese > ranch and it's not particularly close
2. coffee is nasty
3. What's the nicest thing someone else has ever said about you?
4. Would you rather live in 24 hours of daylight or darkness?",1,1769116227.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

It's honestly the biggest positive change in my life in years. Lost a ton of weight, gained a ton of energy, zipping everywhere twice as fast as the buses. But most importantly: after years of being stuck in a 5km2 zone due to not driving and having no public transport...I can finally go wherever I want. I can cycle through the nature, or discover historic sites, or meet a friend for a coffee in a nearby town not served by buses. I can go on day trips, weekend trips, hell, even cycle around the whole coast if I can afford one day. Best spent 100 euro in my life. ",149,1769116178.0,bikecommuting,23,0.98,False

I've read some guides and know coco coir is the optimal choice, but it's not our intention. Please don't give advice for it, I'm not here for that

Hi, my partner and I are growing our own mushrooms for the first time and we're nearing the point where we'll mix our spawn grain with the substrate. We've chosen horse manure (her mom keeps horses so we have it in abundance) and have a few questions on what to do. So far our pasteurizing process looks like this

> Place dried manure in a pillow case. Bring a pot of distilled water to a simmer at 165° - 170°. Place bag of manure in the pot and simmer for 30 - 45 minutes. Weigh down with weights if necessary. After the time is up take out the manure and place into an unopened trash bag. Tie off bag and allow to cool completely.

I have a few questions that I haven't seen answered yet

1. Do we have to let the boiled manure dry before putting it in the trash bag? Is the bag even necessary

2. I've been told we'll need coffee grounds to improve the smell (important as it will be inside) as well as vermiculite for the water retention, what's the ratio of manure : coffee grounds : vermiculite?

3. Should we pasteurize the vermiculite and grounds too? If so, is it okay to mix it with the manure and pasteurize everything at once?

Over break I made an app to try and fix that, and I added a few fun extra features too!

You can heart your favorite dishes and the app will let you know whenever they're being served. You can also rate dishes out of 5 stars and see the average rating from everyone to help you find the best food.

You can download [Bruno Bites](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bruno-bites/id6757173753) on iOS now, and I'm also planning to make a website and maybe an Android app if there's popular demand.

Please let me know if you find any bugs or have feature requests and I hope you enjoy!

Dear Diary and fellow Commanders,

     I’d like to introduce you to 1174’s current “Main Character”. We’ll call him Lee.
Now, we all know the game is called Last War, but our friend has misinterpreted this as ""Last One to use Their Amex Black Card Wins."" Here is a field report on the ""Tyrant"" currently terrorizing RSGE’s hive unprovoked:

1. The ""Tactical"" Genius of Hitting Ash.

     Our friend has reached a level of power so supreme that he no longer needs to fight actual
troops. No, he has evolved. He spent his afternoon heroicly attacking bases that were already on fire. If there is a pile of rubble with 0 resources and 3 remaining T1 troops, you can bet your life he’s going to spend 50 Stamina to let us know he’s still there. Truly, a genius for the modern age.
The best part? He arrived at RSGE’s hive today ready for a bloodbath, only to find a sea of blue
bubbles. There is nothing quite as satisfying as watching a six figure account stare at a $0.00 shield wall. He’s currently hitting ""ash"" because the bubbles hurt his feelings.

2. The World Chat Poet.

     When he isn't ""dominating"" the map, he’s a philosopher in World Chat. His favorite literary
device? Bullying and crying. It takes a special kind of bravery to spend $100,000 on a mobile game and then use that power to tell a F2P player in Indiana that they are ""weak."" We’re all very impressed by your financial commitment to being a middle-schooler, sir.

3. The ""Mission Impossible"" Spies.

     In a plot twist straight out of a drama, he actually planted ""spies"" in RSGE’s alliance. I’m talking deep-cover operatives who followed him around like lost ducklings.
Shockingly, their ""high-level intelligence"" (aka reading the screen) caught them. When the war tantrum ended, suddenly they vanished as if it were magic. 10/10 for the drama, 0/10 for the stealth.

4. The 24-Hour Vigil of Shame.

      After his ""heroic"" tantrum of hitting empty, burning bases yesterday, Lee decided that sleep was for the poor. He stayed up all night—literally staring at his screen—waiting for them to move. Imagine spending the price of a Tesla on a game just to sit in the dark at 4 AM, terrified of a group of ""weak"" players who may launch a counter attack.

Spoiler alert: He didn't know their plan.

5. The 3 PM ""Flash Mob"".

     The second Lee’s eyelids finally got heavy, RSGE arrived. They didn’t just knock; they kicked the door down as I watched with beaming eyes across servers as GOC’s hive lit up like a Christmas tree.

6. The ""Capital"" Temper Tantrum.

     Since GOC can’t win on the battlefield without their daddy’s wallet, they’ve moved to the ultimate petty move: The Capital Blockade. They have officially cut RSGE’s entire alliance off from all Capital rights and buffs. Apparently, ""Total Domination"" at GOC actually means ""We are so scared of you that we have to use administrative settings to keep you down."" Imagine being the strongest alliance on the server and being so threatened by a ""smaller"" group that you have to hoard the Capital buffs like a toddler clutching a toy. It’s not ""governing the server""—it’s a digital hostage situation.


To Lee: Drink some coffee, buddy. You’re going to need it, because it seems to me that RSGE isn’t going anywhere, and your ""Capital Rights"" don't mean a thing when your members are waking up to 0 resources and a smoking base.",11,1769115351.0,LastWarMobileGame,17,0.92,False
1qk6hrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1qk6hrz/frozen_drain_heat_tape/,Frozen drain + heat tape?,"My wife and I just bought a house, and it’s going to be super cold here in Chicago this weekend - and we’d like some advice or thoughts on an issue we’ve been having with a frozen drain pipe.

A few days ago, we left the 2nd faucet in our kitchen dripping so as not to let the water pipes freeze. But a couple mornings later, we came out to find water all over the kitchen floor. We called a plumber and he looked at it and said that the drain pipe had frozen and that’s what was causing the leak. Turns out by letting the faucet drip, we caused the problem we were trying to solve (just on a different pipe.)

The water is currently turned off for that sink (and the fridge), but it’s going to get even colder this weekend and we want to make sure things don’t get worse. As far as we know, the drain is still completely frozen as it hasn’t gotten very warm since we turned the water off.

He mentioned using heat tape as an option to melt the ice that’s currently inside (and keep it from freezing again), but the only ones we’ve seen say “do not use on drains.” 

My assumption here is that the warning on the heat tape is there for a reason, and that we should just wait a couple weeks for the drain to thaw (and then not let that faucet drip in the winter moving forward.) But since the plumber recommended heat tape, I’m thinking maybe it’s ok.

For context, our main sink runs fine and this is just one that sits next to our little coffee nook. We will absolutely survive if we have to leave the water off on this sink for a while, we’re mostly concerned about what kind of long term damage could happen if we let the drain stay frozen, and if things could possibly get worse this weekend.

Any thoughts on how to best move forward would be appreciated! Let me know if there’s anything that needs to be clarified. Thank you!!",2,1769115314.0,HomeImprovement,2,0.76,False

1qk6ftg,https://i.redd.it/ouzyz0zqryeg1.jpeg,Anyone know this novel?,"I'm about to knock my fiancé's room when I hear a woman's groan. 

My phone vibrates, my assistant: ""Have you seen this?"" A link. 

I tap it. 

Evan fills the screen. Undressed. Laughing. There's a woman presses against him, her face turns away, her hands touches his manhood.

The timestamp: now. The location: this hotel.

I step back from the door, the sounds inside suddenly obscene. Intercourse leaking into a public disaster.

Sweat, skin, the sour smell of betrayal.  

I take screenshots, making sure the timestamp is visible. The location. His face.

Then I don't breathe. I just push.

Evan is there, hair damp, eyes bright. Then he sees my face. The color drains out of him.

Behind him, the woman scrambles for her clothes, cheeks flushed, avoiding my gaze. 

""How long?"" I ask.

He swallows. ""It's not what it looks like.""

""I didn't ask what it was,"" I say. ""I asked how long.""

He doesn't answer.

I turn and walk away. Everything I built broke. And the man I loved let it happen.

————————

The Night Everything Breaks

The carpet in the hallway is too soft. That's the first thing I notice as I move toward the corner suite, heels sinking slightly with every step, like the floor is trying to slow me down. Beige walls. Muted art. The kind of hotel designed to feel anonymous so powerful men can come and go without leaving fingerprints.

My phone vibrates again.

And again.

I don't look at it yet. I already know what it says. I've known since the first buzz cut through the low thrum of the elevator music downstairs. When your entire career is built on managing crises, your body learns the warning signs before your brain catches up.

This isn't a normal alert.This is a rupture.

I stop outside the door.

The suite number gleams under the recessed lighting. Evan's room. His name is probably still at the front desk, paired with a smile and a credit card that never declines. Star player. Franchise savior. My client. My fiancé.

I lift my hand to knock, then freeze.

Because the door isn't closed.

It's cracked open just enough to spill sound into the hallway.

Laughter. Low. Intimate.

A woman's voice.

I don't breathe. I don't move. I don't tell myself stories about misunderstandings or context or how this will look ridiculous later when I laugh about it over room service and too-expensive wine.

I don't do that because I've been in this industry long enough to know better.

I step closer.

The phone vibrates again, insistent now. Angry.

I glance down.

A text from my assistant, three words long.

Have you seen this?

There's a link beneath it.

My thumb hovers. For half a second, I consider opening the door instead. Facing whatever is on the other side head-on, like I've done my entire career. Confrontation. Control. Solutions.

But instinct wins.

I tap the link.

The video loads immediately. No buffering. No mercy.

Evan fills the screen. Shirtless. Laughing. His head thrown back in a way I've only seen when he's relaxed, when the game is over and the cameras are gone. There's a woman pressed against him, her face turned away, her hands everywhere they shouldn't be.

The timestamp sits in the corner.

Tonight.

The location tag scrolls beneath it.

This hotel.

My vision sharpens instead of blurring. Every detail locks into place with brutal clarity. The way his hand curves around her hip. The sound of his voice when he murmurs something I can't hear but know was meant to stay private.

This isn't a mistake.

This is a pattern.

I don't watch the whole thing. I don't need to. The damage isn't in the acts themselves. It's in the proof. The confirmation. The fact that this exists outside of us now, living a life of its own.

I swipe to pause, then take screenshots. Three. Four. I make sure the timestamp is visible. The location. His face.

Evidence.

My phone vibrates nonstop now. Messages stacking on top of each other. Assistants. PR reps. People whose jobs depend on my next move.

I step back from the door, the sounds inside suddenly obscene. Private joy leaking into a public disaster.

I make a call.

""Hey,"" I say when my head of crisis answers, voice steady. Too steady. ""I need you to pull every instance of that video you can find. Track the original source. Lock down anything that looks like a secondary upload.""

A pause. ""You've seen it?""

""Yes.""

""Are you with him?""

I glance at the door again. The crack hasn't moved. The laughter hasn't stopped.

""No,"" I say. ""And I won't be.""

I end the call and immediately dial another number. Legal. Then another. Media strategy. Then ownership liaison. The words come easily, clean and controlled, like they always do. I give instructions. I assign tasks. I build a perimeter around a fire that's already out of control.

This is what I'm good at.

This is what I've always been good at.

My phone lights up with a new notification. A sports blog. Then another. A push alert from a major outlet.

The story is moving faster than we are.

I finally knock.

The sound cuts through the noise inside like a blade.

The laughter stops. Footsteps. A muttered curse.

The door opens wider.

Evan stands there, hair damp, eyes bright, a split second away from recognition. Then he sees my face.

The color drains out of him.

""Hey,"" he starts, reaching for me automatically, like I'm part of the room. Like I belong here.

I step back.

Behind him, the woman scrambles for her clothes, cheeks flushed, avoiding my gaze. She looks young. Not scandalously so, but young enough to make the image worse in the court of public opinion. Young enough that someone will write a think piece about power dynamics by morning.

""Get dressed,"" I say, not raising my voice. ""You need to leave.""

She freezes, looking at Evan for confirmation.

He doesn't give it.

I do.

""Now,"" I add, sharper this time.

She moves.

The door closes again, softer than it should. Evan runs a hand through his hair, pacing once like a caged animal.

""Listen,"" he says. ""This isn't, ""

I hold up my phone.

The paused video glows between us.

He stops moving.

His mouth opens. Closes.

Silence stretches. Heavy. Loaded.

""How long?"" I ask.

He swallows. ""It's not what it looks like.""

That's the moment something in me fractures. Not loudly. Not cleanly. Just a quiet, irrevocable shift.

""I didn't ask what it was,"" I say. ""I asked how long.""

He doesn't answer.

That's answer enough.

I turn and walk away before he can say my name again. Before he can reach for me with those hands that just betrayed me in high definition.

The elevator ride down feels endless. My phone keeps vibrating. The world is on fire, and everyone wants a piece of me to put it out.

By the time I reach the lobby, the story has gone fully public.

Screens glow behind the front desk. Staff whisper. A guest looks up as I pass, recognition flickering in his eyes. Pity. Curiosity. Speculation.

I don't slow.

Outside, the city hums on, indifferent and relentless. I step into the night and finally allow myself one sharp breath. Just one.

Then I make another call.

Straight to Evan's number.

It rings.

Once.

Twice.

Straight to voicemail.

I hang up without leaving a message.

He'll call me back, I tell myself. Of course he will. When the shock wears off. When he realizes what's at stake. When he needs me to fix this.

Because I always do.

I spend the rest of the night moving. From call to call. From plan to plan. I draft statements that say everything without admitting anything. I kill rumors before they're born. I negotiate silence where I can and prepare counterpunches where I can't.

Dawn creeps in through the windows of the temporary office I've taken over, painting the sky in soft, unforgiving light.

The first official headline hits just after sunrise.

NBA STAR CAUGHT IN CHEATING SCANDALENGAGED TO HIS AGENT

My name follows his in every article.

I stare at the words until they blur.

I check my phone again.

No missed calls.

No texts.

Nothing.

I wait.

Minutes stretch into hours. The city fully wakes. The news cycle churns. Analysts speculate. Fans argue. The story grows legs, then wings.

Still nothing.

By noon, it's clear.

Evan isn't calling.

Not to apologize.Not to explain.Not to defend me.

Silence settles where trust used to live.

And in that quiet, something else takes shape. Not grief. Not yet.

Resolve.

Because if he won't speak, the world will. And I will not let it tell my story for me.

But right now, in this moment, standing alone with a phone that refuses to ring, there's only one undeniable truth:

Everything I built broke last night.

And the man I loved let it happen.

Success looks different when it's built in exile.

Mine smells like burnt coffee and printer toner, sounds like the low hum of a server rack in the next room, and fits neatly inside a converted warehouse three blocks from the river. No marble lobby. No assistants in heels. No logo etched into glass. Just my name on the lease and my rules on the wall.

Total control.

I like it that way.

""Send the revised language to legal,"" I tell Maya, already halfway down the hall. ""If they push back on the morality clause, we walk.""

She grins without looking up from her tablet. ""Walking is our cardio.""

""Exactly.""

I step into my office and shut the door, letting the quiet settle. Floor-to-ceiling windows. A steel desk scarred just enough to feel honest. Two client chairs that never quite face mine head-on. Subtle. Intentional. Nobody sits across from me unless I want them uncomfortable.

I drop my bag and skim the calendar on my screen. Three consults. One arbitration call. A lunch I'll skip. Normal. Clean. Predictable.

That's the thing about rebuilding. You don't aim for impressive. You aim for stable.

My phone buzzes.

Unknown number.

I ignore it and pull up the contract I was reviewing last night. A mid-level tech founder with a talent for saying the wrong thing on podcasts. Easy work. High margins. Minimal exposure.

The phone buzzes again.

Still unknown.

I sigh and tap voicemail without listening, the way I do when I'm busy and don't feel like being polite. The notification slides into the corner of my screen.

I don't look at it.

Instead, I open my inbox.

Most of it is exactly what I expect. Follow-ups. Signed amendments. A thank-you note from a client who didn't implode this week. Then one subject line stops me cold.

NBA INQUIRY

No sender name. Just an agency email domain I recognize immediately.

My jaw tightens.

I don't open it.

I don't need to.

Five years is a long time, but muscle memory doesn't forget. The league has a way of reaching out like nothing ever happened, like I didn't burn a bridge so completely it took my old career with it.

I hit delete.

No hesitation. No spike of adrenaline. No second-guessing.

I don't do pro basketball anymore.

That part of my life is over.

The phone buzzes again.

This time, I pick it up.

""Make it quick,"" I say, not bothering with hello.

There's a pause on the other end. Then a voice I don't recognize. Polished. Measured. The kind that's been trained not to flinch.

""Ms. Hart,"" he says. ""This is Andrew Collins. I'm calling on behalf of, ""

""No,"" I cut in. ""You're not.""

Another pause. Longer this time.

""I think you'll want to hear me out.""

""I won't."" I hang up and toss the phone onto my desk.

My pulse is up now. Not racing. Just alert. Like it used to get in the fourth quarter, when everything mattered and nothing could go wrong.

I take a breath and force myself back into the contract on my screen.

Two minutes pass.

Then my phone lights up again.

Voicemail.

I don't listen.

I forward it to trash.

Maya knocks once and pokes her head in. ""You okay?""

""Fine.""

She lifts a brow. She knows my tells. ""That was an NBA domain in your inbox.""

""I know.""

""And?""

""And I deleted it.""

She studies me for a beat, then nods. ""Proud of you.""

I snort. ""For what? Basic self-preservation?""

""For not throwing the phone through the window.""

""That comes later,"" I say dryly.

She smiles and disappears back down the hall.

I sit there for a moment, staring at the blank wall opposite my desk, waiting for the familiar ache to surface. The one that used to come with reminders of what I lost.

It doesn't.

What I feel instead is relief.

This life is smaller. Quieter. Mine.

The door stays closed. The world stays out.

My phone buzzes again.

I don't pick it up.

An hour later, I finish my call early and finally check the voicemail list, more out of habit than curiosity. Three new messages. Two from numbers I don't recognize. One marked urgent.

I delete the first without listening.

Then the second.

My thumb hesitates over the third.

Urgent is a tactic. One I used myself, back when people still took my calls. Flag it red. Make it feel like a fire.

I hit play.

""Claire,"" the voice says.

My spine goes rigid.

I haven't heard that voice in years. Not directly. Not without a screen or a commentator layered over it. It's deeper than I remember. Slower. Still unmistakable.

""This is Cal Warren.""

My fingers curl around the phone.

Vice president of basketball operations. The man who used to call me at midnight with ""hypotheticals"" and always got his way. The man who smiled through scandals and survived every one of them.

The man who watched my career burn and never blinked.

""I know it's been a long time,"" he continues. ""I wouldn't be calling if it wasn't important.""

I close my eyes.

He doesn't apologize. He never does.

""There's a situation developing,"" Cal says. ""One that requires discretion. Experience. Someone who understands the ecosystem.""

My jaw tightens.

""I was told you're consulting privately now,"" he adds. ""Smaller clients. More flexibility.""

There it is. The assessment. The reduction.

""I won't insult you by pretending this is a favor,"" he says. ""It's an opportunity. And I'm prepared to make it worth your while.""

I hold the phone away from my ear and stare at the river beyond my windows, sunlight glinting off the water like it has nothing better to do than exist.

""Call me back,"" Cal finishes. ""I'll send the number.""

The line goes dead.

I sit there for a long moment, phone resting in my palm like it weighs more than it should.

Then I laugh.

Once. Sharp. Humorless.

Of course it's Cal. Of course it's framed like a business proposition. Of course he didn't ask if I was willing.

He never asks.

I open the voicemail options and hit delete.

The phone buzzes immediately.

New message.

I don't even look at the number this time. I know who it is.

I swipe it open.

A text.

Sent you the details. Check your email.

I don't reply.

Instead, I stand and pace the length of my office, heels clicking against concrete. This is how it starts. Not with a plea. Not with regret. With money. With leverage.

I stop at the window and let my reflection stare back at me. Same dark hair. Same sharp eyes. New lines at the corners of my mouth. Earned.

I didn't survive five years in exile by accident.

I survived because I learned when to say no.

My inbox pings.

I don't open it.

I go back to my desk, sit down, and pull up my calendar again. Busy. Full. Purpose-built.

Then my phone buzzes one last time.

A new voicemail notification slides across the screen.

I don't know why I open it.

Maybe it's the word urgent. Maybe it's the way Cal's voice sounded... careful.

I listen.

""Claire,"" he says again, and this time there's something else under the control. Pressure. ""The number is eight figures.""

I freeze.

He continues, like he knows exactly what that will do. ""Upfront. No contingencies. Total autonomy.""

My breath catches despite myself.

""This isn't about the league,"" Cal says quietly. ""It's about one player. And you're the only person who can fix it.""

The message ends.

Silence floods the room.

Eight figures.

Total autonomy.

Only person.

I stare at my phone, pulse thudding now, no longer calm or contained. This is different. This isn't a fishing expedition. This is a hook.

I open the trash folder.

The deleted voicemail sits there, waiting.

My thumb hovers over restore.

I tell myself it doesn't mean anything. That listening isn't agreeing. That curiosity isn't weakness.

That I can handle this.

I tap restore.

The voicemail slides back into my inbox like it was never gone.

And just like that, the quiet I built cracks open.",1,1769115191.0,romancenovels,5,1.0,False

I’m building the entire thing in **Kotlin**, and because I’m doing this after my regular 9-to-5, it has become a cycle of coding until 2 AM, eating whatever is easiest (usually unhealthy), and sacrificing sleep to stick to a release schedule.

I’ve pushed out several versions already, and the cycle is always the same:

1. Finish a build.
2. App testers find bugs I didn't even know were possible.
3. Spend my entire evening/night fixing them.
4. Repeat.

The most interesting (and exhausting) part is the ""creative drift."" Sometimes I’ll be halfway through a bug fix and get hit by a wave of creativity. I’ll end up staying up even later to build out a feature I never originally planned for, simply because the idea was too good to let go.

It’s a constant battle between following a strict roadmap and letting the creativity drive the project. I’m proud of the progress and the native performance I’m getting out of Kotlin, but the ""solo dev"" grind is definitely a test of endurance.

**To the other solo devs here:** How do you balance the creative urge to build new features with the soul-crushing reality of a never-ending bug list? And more importantly, how do you stop yourself from living on coffee and junk food while you’re in the zone?",4,1769115090.0,Kotlin,2,0.7,False

He has been busy with work and when he does text it is really engaging and invested asks me about my day etc. I got kinda bored of dropping hints to meet so I said that I was close to him next week for work and I can take a detour on my way home and does he want to meet for a coffee?

Is he not interested and he’s just waiting to let me down at the last minute? Should I just cut my losses and assume that he’s just not that into me?

Hope you're all doing amazing! 
I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you:
Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they’d live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking for someone to GM this story, I’ll contribute as much as you wish. Be it brainstorming, playing some side characters, you name it. As someone who knows how it is to GM, I wish for you to enjoy the roleplay as well (＾-＾)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I’d love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we’d write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^” I don’t mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don’t want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*

(I'd also be open to a similar roleplay inspired by ""Bride's story"" :3)

Why hello! I shall introduce myself a bit, so that you also know who you’re dealing with. You may call me Frog. I’m a passionate, 18+ roleplayer from CET/GMT +1 timezone. However, I do not think those pose any obstacle in terms of writing, so don’t be deterred by that even if you’re from a completely different part of our space-roaming disc silly autocorrect, I meant globe :P. Besides that, I don’t have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that’s worth a mention!

The [X4Y] tag does reflect the gender of my characters, not my own. I prefer not sharing it. I hope you’ll understand <3

Here you’ll find a few requirements, so that we are sure we match.
- *Be 18+. Do not tell me your exact age or real gender, just confirm if you are 18+*
- *Be literate. I love writing, especially descriptions, which I find to greatly enhance the storytelling. I usually provide around 2-4 paragraphs per response and would ask for my partner to be able to match that. However, I’ve recently been hoping to try a short-length approach for conversations to make them more dynamic ^^* 
- *Be creative! Cheesy, I know, but hey, I don’t want to be the only one coming up with the ideas. This premise has so much potential for unique and intriguing tales, let’s brainstorm them together!*
- *Be excited! Yeah, another cheesy one. Yet, I find it so fun to see an enthusiastic reply!*

If you’re anything like me, you’ve over indulged in the internet trying to find the right answer for you. Maybe this helps. **Skip to bullet points for day of procedure.**

1. Pregnancy test is positive, I immediately get a pit in my stomach and think “oh shit, I’m gonna have to get an abortion and that is gonna suck”
2. Reality sets in. The. Mental. Gymnastics. I don’t wish this on anyone. I am not “young” by pregnancy standards, why don’t I want to do this? Is it my relationship? Is it me? Do I want kids? What if this breaks me mentally? What if I regret it? There’s so much I want to do before starting a family. I want to welcome that era with curiosity, not dread. I COULD have this child, that does not mean I should muscle through it and resent the way it happened to me.
3. Book surgical appointment for peace of mind and to force myself into a decision on a definitive timeline. I knew my situation would become infinitely worse the longer I kept it. After my research on surgical versus medical (the pills), I knew I had to go surgical. I was not about to sit at home in pain for hours not knowing what’s actually happening. God speed to those that go that route.
4. Talk to inner circle. Express how insane I felt. How much of a thought loop I was in. Pro and con list. Cry. Eat. Sleep. The final exercise that gave me the most clarity was picture my life with this kid and picture my life with an abortion. Knowing I want kids in the future, but feeling dread about the timing right now, confirmed I needed to trust my gut. If I was doubting my relationship now, having a child definitely ain’t fixing it.
5. Two nights before, sobbing. Overwhelmed, scared, early grief, existentialism. I kept googling what was normal. Shoutout to the people who share their stories, good or bad, it makes me feel a whole lot more human.

\- Vitals, information dump, ultrasound, option to see it or not. I had my mom with me the whole time.

\- They give Ibuprofen and an antibiotic

\- Waiting room (holding cell) needed a tv or SOMETHING

\- Surgical room, undress waist down. The stirrups hold the back of your thighs, not feet like a gyno.

\- Meet the team (PHENOMENAL)

\- Wheel over the laughing gas tube to hold if I wanted

\- Begin: I asked to be told what was going on as he did it

\- Probe, shots for numbing in cervix, I only felt a pinch with 1 out of 2.

\- Began dilating, when he said “just one more” I was like damn that was easy

\- I held that gas tube so mf tight anticipating the “suction”

\- We chatted about donuts, it was over, I thought it only just started, pleasantly surprised. Genuinely 6-8 minutes.

\- There wasn’t even a suction sound?? I thought he was just cranking a dilator, turns out it was the actual procedure happening. I know this is very different depending on how far along you are.

\- Doctor takes all the stuff away

\- I begin to get a massive flush, sweat, they lay cold towels over me, I throw up Gatorade once, it blows over in 10 minutes. That part was worse than the procedure fr. Also doesn’t happen to everyone, I just have vasovagal vibes.

\- Wheelchair me out to Recovery time 20 minutes with heating pad and blanket

\- Vitals check

\- Crackers and juice

\- My boyfriend came to see me

\- Idk if I felt shock or disorientation or just exhaustion because I didn’t drink coffee yet.

\- If I could hug that team of doctors I would, all iconic.

\- Instant rolling tide of thoughts, positive and negative. Doom scrolling for post abortion symptoms and expectations. Didn’t find any. I assume most people truly just try to move on with their life.

\- It could be too fresh right now to tell, but so far I feel grateful. The thought that I’ll never meet that child is definitely upsetting, but I wouldn’t want that child to grow inside an anxiety ridden womb. I believe in the mother’s energy playing a large role in a positive pregnancy. I want my future children to feel wanted, and get the best shot at a two parent household, and if not, at least the most mentally and physically prepared version of myself.

2. **Goal-Oriented, Not Time-Oriented:** My goal is to earn **at least $1.33 per day**. That's $40 divided by 30 days. Some days I hit it in 10 minutes, some days it takes 25.
3. **Instant Cash-Out:** The second I hit $3, I cash out to PayPal. Seeing the money arrive keeps me motivated.

**The Reality:**

* You will get disqualified. Just close and open another.
* Weekends are often better for higher-paying surveys.
* Completing your profile boosts your matches.

It's not a fortune, but $40 is a phone bill, a streaming bundle, or a nice grocery top-up. It's become my automated 'fun money' machine.

I’ve developed a bit of a crush on an ISFP woman who works at my local pub. A few weeks ago, I left her a note with my number, saying that if she fancied a coffee sometime, there was no pressure, but she could give me a call. She texted me the next day, saying she’d love to. However, it was about two weeks before we were both available to meet for that coffee. 

During that time, we texted most days, just briefly, getting to know each other a bit. Less than a week before the planned date, the communication dropped off. I sent her a quick text to check in about the date and confirm the time. A couple of days later, she responded, saying it’s not that she didn’t want to go for coffee, but she was having issues with her phone. She never confirmed the invitation. Two days before our agreed day, I followed up again, asking if she was still interested, but I never heard back. 

Fast forward to Sunday, the day after we would have met. I was at my local pub, and her manager approached me, mentioning she’d heard about me giving my number and to keep texting her. I just smiled politely. Later, a friend noticed the woman in question was in the corner of the pub, looking at me from afar. 

Personally, if someone doesn’t respond to me, I won’t reach out again. Still, it seems odd because she works at my local, we’ve spoken before, and it would have been easy for her to say, “Let’s stay friends,” or, “I have a lot going on,” etc. But she chose not to respond at all. Is this typical ISFP behaviour? I can’t help but think it’s not that she isn’t interested, but rather that she’s conflicted in some way. The other side of me thinks this person is emotionally immature. Thanks in advance for your responses 😊",3,1769114124.0,isfp,7,1.0,False

(dated 4 months and just made 3 months as an official couple, don’t live together) 

I told her that I’m feeling very well but obviously there’s a serious tone so I ask her what’s up. She then tells me she is feeling distance from my side, that I’m not including her or making plans with her and I’m not making her feel thought about or included. 

This came as a surprise to me honestly, up until last night we were texting normally. 

For context: October-December I heavily planed a lot of “spooky, cozy, Christmas” themed dates due to the season and she was super into it. (Halloween party, horror movies, gingerbread house, hot cocoa and movies, etc) then we both spent two weeks apart for the holidays with our families. New year comes round and we are back in our city. 

She tells me that she’s feeling NONE of that energy or excitement from me during these January weeks and that is why she is feeling this way. Almost as if I’m bored or something.

Am I in the wrong here? I feel like she’s upset that I haven’t planned anything “special” or “specific”. 

To be clear, these past weeks we’ve seen each other a lot: going for coffee, joining on each others’ errands, grocery shopping, going out for breakfast, dinner, hanging out basically.

Honestly I would get it more if entire months went by without me making a single, more planned, special date. But isn’t hanging out, grabbing something to eat, doing simple things together, having each others company the core of the relationship?

I’m hoping to hear from people who’ve been through something similar because I’m really struggling with anxiety around this.

About 7 months ago I had an SVT ablation (AVNRT/AVRT). It was a long and complicated procedure (5 hours) because the pathway was in a very difficult spot. The doctors said the ablation itself was successful. After the procedure I was only on ASS 100 for 3 months.

Since the ablation, I’ve been having a lot of ectopic beats. Some days are better, some days are worse.

I’ve had follow-up tests too: ECG, stress test, 24h holter.

The last Holter (2 months ago) showed around 500 PACs and 500 PVCs in 24 hours, with a couple of PVC couplets.

My doctor said everything is benign, no need for beta blockers, and no need to see a specialist urgently. Medically I’m told I’m fine but mentally it’s hard. I’ve been trying to identity patterns of ectopics and why do I get them. I go to the gym 2-3 times per week, I eat healthy, I drink 1-2 coffees per day, I walk a lot. For context I am 28 years old.

But what confuses me is that it’s been 7 months and I still feel ectopics daily. I have also visited a couple of drs everyone says that I’m safe and I don’t need beta blockers but no one gives an answer to my question. Would ectopics ever stop?

I am kinda desperate but not looking for a diagnosis. Rather just real experiences and reassurance from people who’ve lived through this.

Thanks a lot to anyone who reads or replies.",1,1769113882.0,PVCs,11,1.0,False
1qk5una,https://www.reddit.com/r/lesbian/comments/1qk5una/i_need_help_with_how_i_feel/,I need help with how I feel,"Hello to whomever’s reading this!

I (23 F) have been in an in between spot with my really close friend (23 F). She broke up with her longterm girlfriend last year and after about 7 months we started getting really close (we had a whole marriage bit and would compliment each other and flirt and pretend to be married) but one night she told me it wasn’t a joke to her, which in a roundabout way meant she had feelings for me. I have feelings for her in the sense that I got excited, heart jumping and red faced, when I was about to see her but in that moment all I could do was freeze ? I told her I needed time and that I’d get back to her in a way that feels meaningful to both parties. I’m the kind of person to take my time with my words because I never want anything to be misconstrued and I’m not very spontaneous. 

I told her I liked her too (which I do a lot) and we agreed to keep things as they are simply because we’re happy and we have been for about 4 months now; we spend lots of time together playing games together online, texting all the time, hanging out and watching tv in person or just going out for coffee. It feels like we’re dating but not. She respects me and I told her she didn’t have to wait for me because of the uncertainty I feel in myself and that bottomline I just want her to be happy even if that doesn’t mean having a future with me which hurts to type and think about but it’s the truth. She said she wouldn’t make a move until I would.

Fast forward to today I’m happy but I’m a very anxious person with OCD and tend to overthink absolutely everything. I’ll feel really sure about us and feel ready to ask her out most days and some days I feel so incredibly because of my past relationships with my ex-boyfriend. Context: I leapt into a relationship with him because he said he liked me and I realized I was a lesbian a year and a half into our relationship and broke things off, I’m petrified of hurting her because what if something like that happens you know. Like I’ll get chest constricting anxiety at the thought of getting into a relationship sometimes but I can’t differentiate between that being a “this is wrong” feeling or if I’m just genuinely scared of how good this relationship would be if we made it. I worry and get anxious about everything so it’s hard to tell the difference a lot of the time.

I dream of her constantly when I go to sleep (hanging out and kissing), I feel the need to bring her up in everything, I daydream about her and think about what our future would look like and it makes me happy and elated. Outside of that I’m so scared to take that step because of that potential hurt and unknown of it all. Feeling out of control. 

If you made it to the end thank you for your time :) I’d love to hear any advice people can offer me about potential next steps ? or words of encouragement or words that would put me at ease with my anxiety and tell me it’s okay maybe because I’m scared but feel that want to be close, just a matter of trying to soften that anxiety because I really need to feel like less of an alien and more of a girl nervous about the potential of her first wlw relationship ",1,1769113837.0,lesbian,0,1.0,False

All food is served cold and leans more towards fancy toast, charcuterie boards etc. There is only one kitchen person right now. I’m being hired on to help manage the wine bar, but due to my experience in food and Bev, line cook, prep cook etc I’ll also be hopping behind the coffee bar to help barista or helping the kitchen lady with preparing the house maybe syrups, getting plates out etc. I’ve been told that they would also like to utilize me to “spark creativity” and bounce ideas regarding menu items.

I don’t start until next week but I already proposed adding a Mediterranean style board with high end anchovies, lemons, olives, almonds and bread.

The week after I start we also have our annual fish and wildlife expo which brings in thousands to our city. She wants to do a special feature for that event and I already have a red wine in mind as a feature called Game Trail.

 Here’s my question- I was playing around mentally with the concept of cold duck breast. Utilizing a hot plate we could sear off say 20 duck breast in the morning, put them in cold storage. Then later we could thin slice them and offer it as a fancy toast option (I was thinking maybe something with whipped ricotta, figs and balsamic), over a salad (not currently a menu item but she’s expanding still it’s a new spot) or possibly as some kind of “carnivore” board feature for the wildlife event.

I personally LOVE duck breast and think it’s something we can get easily but still has an exotic game bird feel. Price might be an issue though… not sure yet.

Watch forecasts closely. Austin Pets Alive needs 75 foster homes urgently. Pink Barbie dreamhouse in Hudson Bend goes viral on Zillow Gone Wild. Most weekend events still scheduled but check before you go.

# Winter Is Coming (For Real This Time)

A strong arctic cold front is expected to roll into Central Texas, bringing a real chance of freezing rain, sleet, and icy conditions starting Friday and lingering into the weekend. Temps could plunge below freezing, and while it's still too early to say exactly how much ice or snow we'll see around Lake Travis, this is one of those systems worth keeping an eye on.

This means bundling up, watching for icy spots, and adjusting your calendar in real time. The annual questions are already circulating - Do we drip faucets? Is this a bread-and-milk situation?

**Bottom line:** Monitor forecasts closely, prep today/tonight, and expect some weekend events may get cancelled or postponed.

# Today's Events (Thursday Jan 22)

**Book Signing & Ask the Doctor Session** \- Barnes & Noble, 3-5pm (HAPPENING NOW), FREE. Book signing with Dr. Kevin Hoffarth (The Disease of Belief) with answers you've been Googling anyway.

**Showtune Karaoke Night** \- Lago Vista Brewing, 5-8pm, FREE. Presented by Lake Travis Musical Theatre - Broadway confidence pairs surprisingly well with a pint.

**Mahj 102 Class** \- 5 Soul Wine Co., 6-8pm, $75. For when beginner tiles just aren't cutting it anymore.

**Latte Art Throwdown & Market** \- Peaches Coffee, 7pm, FREE. Coffee, competition, and foam judged very seriously.

# Weekend Events (Jan 24-25) - MONITOR WEATHER

**FRIDAY JANUARY 24:**

**Mosaic Art Class** \- Lopez Hill, 10am, $125. Design your own mosaic piece where tiny pieces come together beautifully.

**Kids Crafts: Mini Garden** \- Frontyard Brewing, 1-3pm, FREE. Tiny gardens for them, well-earned drinks for you.

**Lego Club** \- Bee Cave Library, 2-3pm, FREE. Small bricks, very serious engineering.

# Event Postponement

**Through the Looking Glass Gala** \- POSTPONED from Jan 24 to Jan 31. K Oaks Clubhouse, $75. Whimsical night of dressing up turning a magical evening into scholarships and community grants.

# Weekend Weather Strategy

**For Friday Events:** Morning events (Mosaic Art Class at 10am) have better shot than evening. Afternoon events questionable depending on when the front arrives.

**For Saturday Events:** This is the bigger question mark. Chili Cook-Off at Beachside Billy's and painting class at 12 Fox might still happen, but check with venues before heading out. Roads could be sketchy.

**Pro Tip:** If you're planning to go to any weekend event, call ahead Friday morning to confirm they're still happening. Most places will post updates on social media.

# Winter Weather Prep Resources

Since it's been unusually warm and we're all a little out of practice, here's a quick refresher on winter weather prep and emergency resources for Lakeway, Bee Cave, and Lago Vista.

**The Basics:**

* Drip faucets if temps drop below freezing (yes, it's a thing)
* Bring pets inside
* Charge devices now
* Fill up gas tank
* Know where your pipes are
* Have flashlights/batteries ready
* Check on elderly neighbors

**Is This a Bread-and-Milk Situation?** Probably not panic-buying levels, but having a couple days of food/water on hand isn't a bad idea if roads get icy and you don't want to drive.

# URGENT: Austin Pets Alive Needs Foster Homes

Austin Pets Alive urgently needs 75 temporary foster homes ahead of this weekend's freeze. Pick-ups are at the Town Lake Animal Center 12-6pm through Friday, with fostering needed through Wednesday, Jan 28.

If you've got a little extra space and a warm couch, now's the time. These animals need safe, warm places to ride out the cold snap.

**Adopt Me:** Meet Styx McGhee - playful, gentle terrier/lab mix with soulful eyes and excellent manners. His signature move? A single soft paw tap to say good morning...and then waiting patiently if it's not time yet. Smart, sweet, dog-friendly, and easy to love.

# Community Updates

**New Website Coming:** Working on a brand new website launching in the next few weeks. Looking for testimonials, favorite photos of the area, sunsets, weekend outings, or moments that feel very Lake Travis.

**Potential New Event:** Planning a relaxed evening built around good food and good conversation. Not a formal networking thing, not a loud scene - more like the kind of night where you leave having met a few interesting people and wondering why this didn't exist already. More details coming soon.

# Community Poll Results

Last week's location poll showed a big chunk calling Lakeway home, which helps with planning future events and coverage focus.

So here's the thing. I've spent way too much time researching depression lately (books, podcasts, research papers, the whole deal) and found something wild. There's this whole population of people walking around, crushing it at work, posting aesthetic coffee pics on Instagram, laughing at parties, and secretly drowning inside. Like actually drowning. And nobody has a clue.

They call it high functioning depression or smiling depression. It's not the kind of depression you see in movies where someone can't get out of bed for weeks. These people show up. They perform. They smile on cue. But internally? Complete chaos. The worst part is that because they look fine on the outside, nobody including themselves sometimes realizes how bad it actually got.

This isn't about being sad occasionally. Everyone feels like crap sometimes. This is about maintaining a facade so convincing that even your closest friends think you're thriving while you're barely surviving. And the science behind why this happens is actually fascinating and explains why so many people miss the signs completely.

**The Productivity Trap** sounds counterintuitive but staying insanely busy is a classic avoidance mechanism. When you're constantly grinding, taking on extra projects, filling every second of your schedule, you don't have to sit with your thoughts. Dr. Meg Jay talks about this in her work on emerging adulthood. She describes how young people especially use busyness as an anesthetic. You feel productive so you assume you're okay. But that exhaustion you feel isn't from achievement. It's from running away from yourself 24/7. Your brain is literally using work as a distraction drug. 

**The Body Keeps the Score** by Bessel van der Kolk goes deep into how trauma and depression manifest physically when we ignore them mentally. Insanely good read. This book will make you question everything you think you know about mental health. Van der Kolk is a psychiatrist who spent decades treating trauma and his insights on how the body stores emotional pain are mindblowing. After reading it I understood why I'd been getting random headaches and stomach issues for months. Your body is screaming what your mind won't admit.

**The Emotional Flatline** is another huge sign. You're not exactly sad but you're not happy either. Just existing. Everything feels muted like someone turned down the volume on life. Andrew Solomon describes this perfectly in his depression memoir. He calls it the noonday demon, this sense of being trapped in grey. You go through motions. Laugh when appropriate. Respond to texts. But internally there's just this vast emptiness. Nothing excites you anymore, not even stuff you used to love. That's anhedonia and it's one of the core symptoms clinicians look for but people dismiss it because they think depression means crying constantly. It doesn't always.

The **Huberman Lab podcast** has an incredible episode on depression and the neuroscience behind it. Dr Andrew Huberman explains how dopamine circuits get dysregulated and why activities that used to bring pleasure stop working. He also covers actionable stuff like morning sunlight exposure and specific supplements that support mental health. Not trying to oversimplify clinical depression but understanding the biology helps you realize this isn't a character flaw. Your brain chemistry is off.

**The Sleep Disasters** are real. Either you can't fall asleep because your brain won't shut up at 2am, or you sleep 12 hours and still wake up exhausted. Sometimes both in the same week. Sleep architecture gets completely messed up with depression. Matthew Walker who wrote **Why We Sleep** explains how depression and sleep have this bidirectional relationship. Bad sleep worsens depression. Depression destroys sleep quality. It's a brutal cycle. His book is genuinely the best thing I've read on sleep science and after applying his tips my entire mental state shifted. Walker is a neuroscientist at UC Berkeley and his research on how sleep deprivation impacts emotional regulation is scary accurate. You need quality sleep to process emotions and regulate mood. Without it you're fighting an uphill battle.

**The Shame Spiral** might be the worst part. You look around and see people with real problems and feel guilty for struggling when your life looks fine on paper. Good job, loving family, nice apartment. What right do you have to be depressed? This is trash logic but incredibly common. Depression doesn't discriminate based on circumstances. It's not a rational response to external conditions. It's a medical condition. Brain chemistry doesn't care about your salary or Instagram following. Johann Hari talks about this extensively in his work on depression. Society has conditioned us to view mental illness as weakness or self indulgence which makes people hide their symptoms and suffer silently.

Look, if any of this resonates, please talk to someone. A therapist, a friend, your doctor. For busy people who want to understand this stuff deeper without dedicating hours to reading, **BeFreed** is an AI learning app built by experts from Columbia and Google that pulls from psychology books, research papers, and expert insights to create personalized audio content. You can set a goal like understand and manage high-functioning depression and it generates a structured learning plan with content from sources like the books mentioned above plus clinical research. 

The depth is adjustable, anywhere from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples and context. The voice options are honestly addictive, including everything from calm and soothing to more energetic tones depending on your mood. Makes learning about mental health way more accessible when you're commuting or doing laundry.

There's also **Wysa** which uses AI to provide mental health support through CBT techniques. It's actually pretty solid for those days when you need someone to talk to but can't reach your therapist. Or **Sanvello** which helps track mood patterns and has community support features.

The brain is just another organ and sometimes it malfunctions. You wouldn't feel ashamed about getting treatment for a broken leg. Depression isn't fundamentally different except society has created this weird stigma around it. But that stigma is slowly breaking down as more people speak openly about their experiences. The science is clear. Treatment works. Therapy works. Sometimes medication works. And recognizing the problem is the first step toward actually addressing it instead of performing wellness while falling apart inside.

I’m a deeply relational person who values warmth, consistency, and care over time. I love intentionally and thoughtfully, and I’m most drawn to connections that feel grounded — not rushed, not compartmentalized, and not built only when things are easy.

I’ve practiced polyamory for several years with communication, transparency, and consent at the center. I’m currently navigating a relationship transitional period, with supports in place and I’m consistently setting and not negotiating boundaries. I’m interested in connections that are honest, integrated into real life, and approached with steadiness.

I value human connection deeply. I’m curious, emotionally attuned, and comfortable with depth, accountability, and repair. And for me, repair comes from softness — approaching moments of hurt with curiosity rather than suspicion, taking responsibility for impact, and being willing to talk things through with care.

In everyday life, I show up consistently — thoughtful check-ins, clear communication, and emotional presence even when things are imperfect. A date with me might look like a slow walk, a museum visit, or cozy conversation over coffee. I enjoy unhurried time, shared attention, and moments that feel simple and real.

I’m looking for someone emotionally available and self-reflective, who communicates clearly, is kind under stress, and wants to build something steady and sustainable. I’m not interested in being an “extra lane” or a place where feelings get offloaded without care — I’m interested in connection where desire is matched with capacity.

If this feels grounding rather than intimidating, and you know yourself well enough to show up with curiosity, consistency, and care, I’d be glad to hear from you.

And with what brewer, type of beans, etc.? And how would you describe your preferences and the coffee you produce? 

I’ve been using anywhere from 70-90 clicks which is on the finer end of what I’ve been recommended to use, but my coffee is still always fairly acidic, sometimes very much so.

For context: I brew at 92-95°C in a v60 with cafec abaca filters, TWW LR profile water, ratios of 1:16.6-1:18, and I use the standard 3xdose bloom for 45s-1m, followed by 2 equal low ag pours and a swirl for my recipe

I buy light roasts, always fermented, in a variety of processes e.g. natural, yeast, honey, shock, etc.

And I’m trying to get better at 2 things:

Brewing coffees that better represent the makers’ intentions. 

And learning how to tame the acidity of certain coffees so that my family and friends, who are less used to such bright coffee, can enjoy them with me. 

I’m happy with the coffee I’m making, but sometimes I wonder if I’ve developed a taste for under-extracted coffees, as everything I make is always very acidic in this grind range. I expect that for many of these coffees, some acidity is unavoidable or even intentional, given what they are, but I wonder all the same if I’m truly ‘dialing in’ my brews to what they’re intended to be, or if I’m simply accepting a recipe as soon as it yields the flavors advertised on the package. 

We’ve all heard the advice to grind finer when the coffee is too acidic and to grind courser when it’s too bitter, but how do you know which way to move when the coffee has a default level of acidity?

And lastly, I’ve always been told to brew light roasts at 95°C+ and to brew natural and experimentally processed coffees much cooler at 85°-92°C. So what should I be using for coffees that are both light and natural? Which is to say, most coffees on this sub.

1qk5lru,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellbutrin_Bupropion/comments/1qk5lru/im_so_sick_and_tired_of_this_generic_roulette/,I'm so sick and tired of this generic roulette!,"I've been on this med for almost five years and I've tried so many different manufacturers throughout the years and for some reason, they never really felt the same to me. They all caused different side effects and had different level of effectivness for me. Which is so strange, since it's the same active compound, so the difference shouldn't be that huge. Unfortunately this has been proven for me over and over again, that's not the case at all.

I had something happening recently. When I got my new script from my pharmacy and didn't have the time to look at which manufacturer it was. I took it and afterwards I knew Immediately something wasn't right. It felt different to me somehow. For reference, I always usually have  like 2-3 cups of coffee everyday and I've never had a problem with that amount on the manufacturer that I've taken before. Well, I had the same amount of caffeine on the different manufacturer and that was the biggest mistake I ever made. I sent me straight off to a panic attack that wouldn't go away. I got heart palpitations, rapid heart rate, chest tightness, extreme hot flashes, severe headaches, dizziness, nausea, you name it. It was probably the worst panic attack that I've had in a long time and I thought I was about to die or something. It clearly felt like overstimulation and like it was too much adrenaline. Luckliy I had some magnesium capsules and took one and it calmed it all down. Afterwards I felt quite shocked that I had such a bad panic attack, after having the same amount of caffeine like I always have. So that got me thinking about it. I did took a look at the manuufacturer afterwards and realized it had been changed and it was not the same one like I always take.

This is just another proof that the generics of this med are not the same at all. I'm so sick and tired of other people saying that's not case at all and there should be no difference, otherwise you're feeling placebo. I can 100 % guarantee, this was not placebo at all what I felt. I know you're not supposed to have too much caffeine on this med. But I had the same amount like I always have and never had a issue with it before, so why suddenly now? The only explanation to that was that the manufacturer was changed. 

It's so annoying to always have to look at which generic you get, because If you get the wrong one, you can have an adverse reaction to it. I didn't look this time and that was a big mistake, otherwise I would have gotten the other one I always usually have. The other manufacturer I always take is called Bluefish and it feels so smooth to me and that's why I prefer that one. This time I got Accord instead and it feels way harsher to me than Bluefish and that's probably the reason why I reacted badly when I had the same amount of caffeine with it. Well, I learned my lesson now and had to cut down my caffeine intake now that my manufacturer has been changed once again.

 This post is just another reminder to be careful if your manufacturer gets changed, because some people like me are very sensitive to just slight changes and if we get the wrong one, everything can go hellish, like it did for me. ",3,1769113281.0,Wellbutrin_Bupropion,3,1.0,False
1qk5kw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnWire/comments/1qk5kw2/how_to_start_a_digital_marketing_company_the_real/,How to Start a Digital Marketing Company: The Real Path From Zero to Profitable Agency,"https://preview.redd.it/4wckqqltlyeg1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a8fc59aedd462e5c9ca51b20b7c927d7bb04d96

Everyone's telling you that learning how to start a digital marketing company is your ticket to freedom, flexibility, and six-figure income.

And honestly? They're not completely wrong.

But here's what they're not telling you: most digital marketing agencies fail within the first year—not because the owners lack skills, but because they get stuck in the same trap that kept me spinning my wheels for over a decade.

They confuse learning about digital marketing with building a digital marketing business. Two completely different things.

I've been in the trenches. I've made every mistake you're about to make (and then some). I've also figured out what actually works—the stuff that took me from endless research mode to $600k+ in real revenue.

This isn't theory. This is the battle-tested blueprint.

# Key Takeaways

* Start with ONE service offering and expand only after you've proven demand—analysis paralysis kills more agencies than bad marketing ever will
* You don't need an office, employees, or fancy software to launch a profitable digital marketing company in 2026
* Your first client should come from your existing network, not expensive ads or complex funnels
* The ACTION GAP between learning and doing is where most aspiring agency owners get permanently stuck
* Profitable agencies solve specific problems for specific people—generalist ""we do everything"" positioning is a race to the bottom

# Understanding What a Digital Marketing Company Actually Does (And Doesn't Do)

Modern minimalist office workspace showing laptop screen displaying digital marketing agency business plan template with revenue projections

Let's cut through the BS right now.

A digital marketing company helps businesses get customers online. That's it. Everything else is just different flavors of that core mission.

You're not building the next Ogilvy. You're creating a business that solves real problems for real clients who will pay you real money.

When I started researching how to start a digital marketing company, I got buried in content about ""building your brand identity"" and ""crafting your agency mission statement."" Complete waste of time.

Here's what actually matters: Can you help a business owner get more leads, sales, or visibility? If yes, you have a business. If no, keep learning the craft (but set a deadline—more on that later).

# The Services That Actually Make Money

Not all digital marketing services are created equal. Some are profitable from day one. Others require massive overhead and expertise.

High-profit, low-overhead services:

* SEO consulting and implementation
* Content marketing and strategy
* Social media management
* Email marketing campaigns
* PPC management (if you know what you're doing)
* Marketing automation setup

Services that sound sexy but drain resources:

* Video production (equipment costs, time intensive)
* Full website development (scope creep nightmare)
* App development (wrong business model entirely)
* ""Full-service"" everything (you'll drown)

I learned this the hard way. Spent six months trying to offer ""comprehensive digital solutions"" and landed exactly zero clients. Why? Because nobody wakes up thinking ""I need comprehensive digital solutions.""

They wake up thinking ""I need more customers"" or ""My website doesn't show up on Google.""

Solve that specific problem. Get paid. Expand later.

# How to Start a Digital Marketing Company: The Lean Launch Method

Here's the truth that took me 10+ years to figure out: you're overthinking this.

The traditional advice about how to start a digital marketing company goes something like this:

1. Write a business plan
2. Secure funding
3. Rent office space
4. Hire a team
5. Build your website
6. Create marketing materials
7. THEN start looking for clients

That's backwards and expensive.

Here's what actually works in 2026:

# Step 1: Pick ONE Service You Can Deliver This Month

Not next quarter. Not after you take another course. This month.

Look at your current skills. What can you do right now that would help a business get more customers?

Maybe you're good at writing. Start with content marketing or email campaigns.

Maybe you understand Facebook ads. Start there.

Maybe you can optimize websites for search. SEO consulting it is.

The key: specificity beats versatility every single time.

I spent years as a ""digital marketing generalist"" making poverty wages. The moment I niched down to software reviews and YouTube affiliate strategies? Revenue exploded.

# Step 2: Validate With Your Network Before Building Anything

This is where most people stuck in analysis paralysis screw up.

They build the website, create the LLC, design the logo, print business cards, and THEN try to find clients.

Flip that script.

Your validation process:

1. Make a list of 20 people you know who run businesses (or work at companies that hire agencies)
2. Send them a direct message: ""Hey \[Name\], I'm helping \[specific type of business\] get \[specific result\]. Know anyone who might need that?""
3. Have 5-10 conversations this week
4. If people say ""actually, I need that"" or ""let me introduce you to someone""—you've got validation
5. If everyone says ""interesting but no thanks""—pick a different service or audience

I landed my first three clients through LinkedIn messages to former colleagues. No website. No business cards. Just a clear offer and genuine relationships.

Took me about four days.

# Step 3: Deliver Results Before Scaling Infrastructure

Here's the part that separates real business builders from perpetual planners.

Get a paying client before you:

* Register your LLC
* Build your website
* Create your ""agency processes""
* Hire anyone
* Buy expensive tools

Why? Because nothing clarifies your business model like actual client work.

You'll learn more in one month of client delivery than six months of research. You'll discover what you actually enjoy doing, what clients actually need, and what you can actually charge.

# The Minimum Viable Agency Setup

When you're starting out, here's literally all you need:

Tools (under $100/month total):

* Google Workspace for email ($6/user/month)
* Canva Pro for graphics ($13/month)
* Project management tool like Trello or Asana (free tier)
* Communication: Zoom (free) or Slack (free)
* Invoicing: Wave or PayPal (free)

Legal structure:

* Start as a sole proprietor (literally just you, your name, your SSN)
* Upgrade to LLC when you're making $3-5k/month consistently
* Don't let legal structure become another excuse for analysis paralysis

Your ""office"":

* Your current desk
* Coffee shops
* Client offices
* Anywhere with WiFi

I ran a five-figure monthly agency from my kitchen table for 18 months. The clients didn't care. They cared about results.

# Building Your Client Acquisition System (Without Burning Cash on Ads)

Most guides on how to start a digital marketing company tell you to ""invest in marketing"" right away.

Translation: spend money you don't have on ads that probably won't work because you haven't dialed in your messaging yet.

Here's what actually works when you're starting from zero:

# The Warm Outreach Method

Your first 5-10 clients should come from people who already know, like, or trust you.

Your warm network includes:

* Former colleagues and bosses
* College friends who now run businesses
* LinkedIn connections (yes, even the ones you haven't talked to in years)
* Family members with businesses
* Friends of friends (ask for intros)
* Local business owners you frequent

The script that worked for me:

""Hey \[Name\], hope you're doing well! I'm working with \[specific business type\] to \[specific result\]. I know you \[run a business/work with businesses\]—would love to grab coffee and hear what's working for you on the marketing front. Any chance you're free this week?""

No hard sell. Just genuine curiosity and a clear specialty.

Half of those conversations will lead nowhere. A quarter will lead to referrals. A quarter will turn into clients or strong leads.

# The Content Authority Play

Here's the strategy that built my entire business: Help Don't Sell.

Start creating content that demonstrates your expertise:

* LinkedIn posts about client results
* YouTube videos solving specific problems
* Blog posts answering questions your ideal clients ask
* Case studies (even if they're from discounted early clients)

I built a YouTube channel reviewing software and teaching affiliate marketing strategies. That channel has generated more leads than any ad campaign ever could.

The content compounds. A video I made 18 months ago still brings in clients today.

# The Strategic Partnership Approach

Find businesses that serve your ideal clients but don't compete with you.

Examples:

* If you do SEO, partner with web designers
* If you do social media, partner with photographers
* If you do email marketing, partner with copywriters
* If you do PPC, partner with conversion rate optimizers

The pitch: ""I work with \[your ideal client\]. I noticed you do too. Want to refer clients back and forth when they need services we don't offer?""

I have three partnership relationships that send me 2-3 qualified leads per month. Took zero dollars to build, just coffee meetings and genuine relationship building.

# Pricing Your Services (Without Undercharging or Overcharging)

Pricing is where most new agency owners sabotage themselves.

They either charge so little they can't sustain the business, or they charge so much they scare away early clients who could provide testimonials and case studies.

# The Three Pricing Models That Work

1. Project-based pricing (best for beginners)

* Clear scope, clear deliverable, clear price
* Example: ""Website SEO audit and implementation plan: $2,500""
* Pro: Easy to sell, defined end point
* Con: Income inconsistency

2. Monthly retainer (best for sustainability)

* Ongoing services, predictable revenue
* Example: ""Social media management (3 posts/week, community engagement): $1,500/month""
* Pro: Recurring revenue, deeper client relationships
* Con: Scope creep if you're not careful

3. Performance-based (best when you're confident)

* You get paid based on results
* Example: ""10% of ad spend managed + 20% of revenue generated from campaigns""
* Pro: Unlimited upside, easier to sell
* Con: Dependent on factors outside your control

My recommendation: Start with project-based to build case studies, transition to retainers for stability, add performance bonuses for upside.

# What to Actually Charge

Here's the range I've seen work in 2026:

|Service|Beginner Rate|Intermediate Rate|Expert Rate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|SEO Audit|$500-1,000|$1,500-3,000|$5,000+|
|Monthly SEO|$1,000-2,000|$3,000-7,000|$10,000+|
|Social Media Management|$500-1,500|$2,000-4,000|$5,000+|
|Content Marketing|$1,500-3,000|$4,000-8,000|$12,000+|
|PPC Management|10-15% of spend|15-20% of spend|20%+ of spend|
|Email Marketing|$1,000-2,000|$2,500-5,000|$7,500+|

Start at the lower end. Build case studies. Raise rates every 3-6 months as you prove results.

I started charging $750/month for content marketing. Within 18 months I was charging $4,500 for the same service because I had proof it worked.

# Avoiding the Traps That Kill Digital Marketing Agencies

Let me save you from the mistakes that almost ended my business before it started.

# Trap #1: Shiny Object Syndrome

Every week there's a new platform, strategy, or ""revolutionary"" approach to digital marketing.

TikTok ads! AI content! Web3 marketing! Metaverse strategies!

Here's what actually happens: you abandon what's working to chase what's new. Your expertise never deepens. Your results stay mediocre.

The antidote: Pick 2-3 core services. Master them completely. Add new offerings only when you've maxed out the current ones.

I wasted two years jumping between ""opportunities."" The breakthrough came when I committed to YouTube affiliate marketing and Skool community strategies for 18 consecutive months.

Boring? Maybe. Profitable? Absolutely.

# Trap #2: Perfectionist Paralysis

Your website doesn't need to be perfect. Your service packages don't need to cover every scenario. Your onboarding process doesn't need to be automated.

You need clients and results. Everything else is procrastination.

I spent four months building the ""perfect"" agency website. Know how many clients it generated? Zero.

The Google Doc proposal I threw together in 45 minutes? Closed three clients in two weeks.

Consistent imperfect action beats perfect planning every single time.

# Trap #3: The Generalist Trap

""We do SEO, PPC, social media, content marketing, web design, email marketing, and consulting.""

Translation: ""We're not particularly good at anything, but we're desperate for any client.""

Specialists charge more, close faster, and deliver better results.

When I repositioned from ""digital marketing agency"" to ""YouTube affiliate marketing specialist for software entrepreneurs,"" my close rate tripled and my prices doubled.

Counterintuitive but true: the narrower your focus, the bigger your market.

# Trap #4: Hiring Too Soon

You don't need employees. You need systems and contractors.

The progression that actually works:

1. You do everything (months 1-6)
2. You hire contractors for specific tasks (months 6-12)
3. You build systems and processes (months 12-18)
4. You hire part-time specialists (months 18-24)
5. You consider full-time employees (year 2+)

I tried to hire a ""team"" at month three. Burned through $15k and got mediocre work because I didn't know what good looked like yet.

Do the work yourself first. Then you'll know exactly what to delegate and how to evaluate it.

# Scaling From Side Hustle to Full-Time Income

Here's the path I've seen work repeatedly (including for myself):

Months 1-3: Validation Phase

* Goal: Land 2-3 clients at any reasonable price
* Focus: Delivery and learning
* Revenue target: $2,000-5,000/month
* Time investment: 10-20 hours/week

Months 4-6: Systematization Phase

* Goal: Refine your service delivery
* Focus: Creating repeatable processes
* Revenue target: $5,000-10,000/month
* Time investment: 20-30 hours/week

Months 7-12: Growth Phase

* Goal: Fill your capacity
* Focus: Client acquisition and retention
* Revenue target: $10,000-20,000/month
* Time investment: 30-40 hours/week (or go full-time)

Year 2: Scale Phase

* Goal: Build a business that doesn't require you for every task
* Focus: Team building and systems
* Revenue target: $20,000-50,000/month
* Time investment: 40+ hours/week managing, not doing

The decision point: Most people quit their job too early or too late.

Too early: You panic when revenue dips and make desperate decisions.

Too late: You're too burned out to give the business the energy it needs.

My rule: Go full-time when you've had 3 consecutive months at 75% of your current salary, with a 6-month emergency fund saved.

# The Real Timeline for Building a Profitable Digital Marketing Company

Let me be brutally honest about what ""how to start a digital marketing company"" actually looks like in practice.

Month 1: You'll question everything. You'll send 50 outreach messages and get 3 responses. You'll wonder if this was a stupid idea.

Month 2: You'll land your first client (probably at a rate that makes you cringe later). You'll be terrified you can't deliver. You'll over-deliver out of fear.

Month 3: You'll realize you actually can do this. You'll also realize you priced too low. You'll start thinking about systems.

Month 6: You'll have 3-5 clients. You'll be working more than your day job. You'll be making less per hour than you did as an employee. You'll wonder if you should quit.

Don't quit.

Month 9: Something clicks. You raise your rates. A big client says yes. You see the path forward clearly for the first time.

Month 12: You're making decent money. Not quit-your-job money yet, but you can see it from here. You've figured out your niche. You've got case studies. You've built some systems.

Month 18: You're profitable. Maybe even full-time. You've hired some contractors. You're thinking about the business, not just doing the work.

This is the real timeline. Not the ""I made $50k in my first month"" BS you see on Instagram.

Anyone telling you it's faster is either lying or got extremely lucky (and luck isn't a strategy).

# Building Systems That Let You Scale

Here's what nobody tells you about how to start a digital marketing company: the business you build at $5k/month won't work at $20k/month.

You need systems that scale with you.

# The Core Systems You Actually Need

Client acquisition system:

* Where leads come from (content, referrals, partnerships)
* How you qualify them (not every lead is worth pursuing)
* Your sales process (discovery call, proposal, close)
* Follow-up sequence (most deals close on follow-up 3-5)

Service delivery system:

* Onboarding process (how clients start working with you)
* Project management (how work gets done and tracked)
* Communication cadence (weekly updates, monthly calls, etc.)
* Quality control (how you ensure good work)

Financial system:

* Invoicing and payment collection (automate this immediately)
* Expense tracking (you'll need this for taxes)
* Profit analysis (which services actually make money?)
* Cash flow projection (know what's coming in and out)

I built these systems gradually. Started with Google Docs and spreadsheets. Upgraded to proper tools as revenue justified it.

The rule: Don't buy software until the manual process is painful. Then you'll know exactly what you need.

# The Mindset Shifts That Separate Success From Struggle

After a decade of struggle and a breakthrough to $600k+, here's what I know for sure:

The businesses that succeed aren't the ones with the best skills. They're the ones that close the ACTION GAP between learning and doing.

# Shift #1: From Perfectionist to Iterationist

Your first offer will be imperfect. Your first client work will be imperfect. Your first pricing will be imperfect.

Launch it anyway.

You'll learn more from one imperfect client project than from six months of ""getting ready.""

I've rebuilt my entire business model four times. Each iteration was better because I had real market feedback, not theoretical planning.

# Shift #2: From Consumer to Creator

Stop consuming content about digital marketing agencies. Start building one.

The gurus profit from keeping you learning. They need you stuck in research mode, buying the next course, attending the next webinar.

Set a deadline. After \[specific date\], no more courses, no more research, no more ""learning."" Just building.

I had 47 browser tabs open researching ""the best way"" to start. Know what closed them? Sending my first proposal and getting a yes.

# Shift #3: From Generalist to Specialist

The riches are in the niches. I know you've heard this before. I know you're still resisting it.

Resist less.

When you specialize, you:

* Charge more (experts command premium rates)
* Close faster (you speak your client's language)
* Deliver better (deep expertise beats broad knowledge)
* Market easier (clear positioning attracts clear clients)

My breakthrough came when I stopped trying to help ""everyone with digital marketing"" and started helping ""software entrepreneurs with YouTube affiliate strategies.""

Revenue tripled in six months.

# Shift #4: From Lone Wolf to Community Builder

You don't need to figure this out alone.

Find your people:

* Join communities where agency owners hang out (like my YouTube Affiliate Accelerator—more on that below)
* Attend local business meetups
* Participate in online forums and groups
* Find an accountability partner

I wasted years trying to figure everything out myself. The moment I joined communities of people doing what I wanted to do? The learning curve compressed dramatically.

You're not competing with other agency owners. There are more businesses that need help than there are good agencies to help them.

# Common Mistakes When Learning How to Start a Digital Marketing Company

Let me rapid-fire the mistakes I see constantly:

❌ Waiting until you ""know enough"" - You'll never feel ready. Start before you're ready.

❌ Copying someone else's business model exactly - What worked for them in their market won't necessarily work for you in yours.

❌ Undervaluing your services - Charging $500/month for 40 hours of work isn't humble, it's unsustainable.

❌ Overcomplicating the offer - ""We do everything"" is not an offer. ""I help dentists get more patients through Google Ads"" is.

❌ Ignoring the financials - You need to know your numbers. Profit per client, cost to acquire, lifetime value.

❌ Trying to automate before you've done it manually - Build the system by hand first. Then automate the painful parts.

❌ Chasing every lead - Not every prospect is a good fit. Bad clients will destroy your business faster than no clients.

❌ Neglecting your own marketing - The cobbler's children have no shoes. Practice what you preach.

Every single one of these mistakes? I've made them. Some multiple times.

Learn from my expensive education.

# The Resources You Actually Need (And the Ones You Don't)

You need:

* A clear service offering
* A way to communicate with clients (email, Zoom)
* A way to deliver the work (tools specific to your service)
* A way to get paid (PayPal, Stripe, Wave)
* A way to track projects (Trello, Asana, even Google Sheets)

You don't need:

* Expensive office space
* A team (at first)
* Fancy CRM software (at first)
* Paid advertising budget
* Professional branding agency
* Custom website (a good landing page beats a mediocre full site)

The tools I actually use:

* Google Workspace for email and docs
* Canva for graphics
* Loom for video messages
* Calendly for scheduling
* Stripe for payments
* Notion for project management

Total monthly cost: under $150.

The rest is just shiny object syndrome disguised as ""professional business setup.""

# Your Next Steps: From Reading to Building

Here's where most people close this article, think ""great information,"" and then do absolutely nothing.

Don't be most people.

Here's your action plan for the next 30 days:

Week 1: Decide and Declare

* Pick ONE service you can deliver this month
* Define your ideal client (be specific: industry, size, problem)
* Write a simple offer: ""I help \[who\] get \[result\] through \[method\]""
* Tell 10 people what you're doing

Week 2: Validate

* List 20 people in your network who might need your service (or know someone who does)
* Reach out to 10 of them this week
* Have at least 3 conversations
* Refine your offer based on feedback

Week 3: Create Minimum Viable Assets

* Simple landing page or Google Doc explaining your offer
* Pricing structure (even if you're guessing)
* Basic proposal template
* Simple contract (Google ""freelance contract template"")

Week 4: Close Your First Client

* Follow up with everyone from week 2
* Send proposals to interested prospects
* Offer a ""founding client"" discount if needed
* Get one paying client, even if it's at a lower rate

That's it. That's how you actually start a digital marketing company in 2026.

Not by reading more articles. Not by taking another course. Not by waiting until you feel ready.

By doing the uncomfortable work of putting yourself out there and making offers.

# Conclusion: Stop Researching, Start Building

You've made it to the end of this guide on how to start a digital marketing company.

You now know more than 90% of people who are ""thinking about"" starting an agency.

The question is: what are you going to do with this information?

Because here's the truth that took me 10+ years to figure out: The ACTION GAP is the only thing standing between you and a profitable digital marketing business.

Not your skills. Not your experience. Not your network. Not your resources.

Your willingness to take consistent imperfect action.

I spent a decade consuming content, taking courses, and ""learning"" digital marketing. I made my first real money when I stopped learning and started doing.

You can research how to start a digital marketing company for another six months. You can take another course. You can wait until you feel ""ready.""

Or you can send your first outreach message today.

The businesses that win aren't the ones with perfect plans. They're the ones that start before they're ready, learn from real clients, and iterate based on actual market feedback.

Your move.

Look, I get it — starting in digital marketing can feel overwhelming.  
You read articles, watch videos, and still feel like you’re missing the practical pieces: real examples, accountability, and seeing what actually works right now.

That’s why I spend most of my time focused on execution rather than theory:

* Sharing real screenshots and revenue numbers instead of vague promises
* Breaking down strategies I’ve personally used over multiple years
* Talking openly about what’s working now, not recycled advice from 2019
* Staying around people who are actively building, not just consuming content

I’ve found that progress comes less from “knowing more” and more from being around others who are actually applying what they learn and comparing notes honestly.

[Curious how others here approach accountability](https://swiy.co/yaadmd) and real-world testing when building affiliate or digital marketing projects. What’s helped you move from research into action?

1qk5izb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheHallowdineLibrary/comments/1qk5izb/a_forgotten_curio_shop/,A Forgotten Curio Shop,"There are forgotten places in every city.  
They decay quietly, buried beneath newer buildings. Layers of less-forgotten places pile up on top of them, like the striations in some prehistoric canyon. But the colours of this history are not limestone white and clay orange; these are concrete grey, and the rich browns of old wood.  
A few of these abandoned places can still be found, by the tenacious and the lost. They wait patiently behind swollen doorways and down ill-used stairs, littered with middens of brittle rat droppings. Some can’t be accessed at all. The eyes of their windows gaze only into dirt and darkness, and once-bright paint trembles to dust as trucks and cars rumble overhead. Modern vibrations quickly hasten the entropy of years.  
Some suffocate, when an earthquake cracks the last support shoring up a mouldering mausoleum. Concrete and dirt thunders in, eager to fill the dusty void and mill the antique carpentry to splinters. Others drown, when a water main develops a leak, filling the underground void with water one slow drip at a time. All things inside swell and rot, their sodden fibres becoming a uniform grey slurry at the bottom of a secret urban lake.  
But some places survive. Although they are mostly forgotten, the meticulous care with which they were built ensures that they persist. Or perhaps they are loaned an enduring spirit by their purpose, or what they contained.  
Once in a while, someone will stumble across one of those places, without having any idea what it is.  
This is a story about such a place.

   
Some cities should never have been built.  
The place where I live is a case study. The original tiny settlement, built in a hill-bound harbour, expanded too fast with the influx of population in its infancy. Like many overfed toddlers, it grew into a fat, sprawling adult. The messy metropolis drapes itself over the steep hills, demanding and devouring more inhospitable land every year. Consequently, roads are too narrow, houses the same; their piles and supports exposed and raw from erosion as constant sea-storms batter the soil into salty mud. Having lived here all my life, this seemed perfectly normal until I chanced to visit a land-bound city, all flat and geometric; the streets straighter than arrows, neatly laid out like the grids in a mathematics book.  
To outsiders, my city seems needlessly convoluted, with streets stacked above one another, hidden tunnels and scribbly wooden bridges connecting otherwise disparate terraces together. The harbourside central city is even worse. Hundreds of years of accumulated architecture have been colonised by newly-minted towers of glass and steel, like so many modern parasites.  
It’s the sort of place where anyone can get lost. Even people who are born here can’t resist the occasional wrong turn, just to see where that weird little road they’ve never been down might lead them. I did that a lot, walking in no particular direction through the twisting, mazy streets just to see where I would end up. And that’s precisely how I managed to stumble upon the curio shop.  
I’d seen the entrance many times, but I’d never felt the urge to explore. It was a brick-arched alley, narrow and dingy, with no signage, and no indication that anything interesting lay within. I don’t know why that familiar arch piqued my curiosity on that particular day. But I found myself walking beneath it, navigating the cracked paving stones of an alley that curled between buildings and ended in a flight of graffitied concrete stairs. They lead up and down, both directions littered with faded city garbage.  
Down the stairs I found nothing but a cave-in of rubble and scum-covered water. But upwards, the steps opened onto *another* brick alley, carpeted with grey-green lichens and spongy boluses of moss.  
My shoes were sodden when I found the ancient arcade at the very end.  
It must have been glorious, once upon a time. A not-quite-Victorian wonder of leadlights and timber, diamond panes of red and yellow glass were interspersed with wrought iron and glazed tiles. But now the tiles were cracked and broken, the clever mosaics smashed beyond recognition. The glass was equal parts whole and shattered, mould-rimed fragments of it crunching beneath my feet.  
It was a sort of mezzanine arcade, clearly built to show off a lower level, which must have been a pretty space, centred around a painted fountain and an indoor garden. No water gushed from the flaking stone snouts of the bottlenosed dolphins in the centre of the water feature now, and the thick sludge accumulated in the basin below them barely counted as water, grown green with algae.  
Somewhere in the overgrown moistness of ferns and grass around the fountain, a frog registered its displeasure at my echoing footsteps, then fell silent.  
Most of the shops were empty or boarded up. One was piled to the roof with broken furniture; sagging upholstery long succumbed to fungus and time, strips of haberdashery hanging like flayed flesh from wooden bones.  
But at the end of the arcade stood a single, impossible, pristine store, its stained glass intact and the wood shining with linseed. Yellow and orange light gloamed in windows stacked with an assortment of useful and unnameable junk. Some of the items looked like they pre-dated my grandparents.  
Above the door, in a curling font so old I’d never seen anything like it before, was painted “A Forgotten Curio Shop”.  
Was this all some sort of elaborate, theatrical setup for a boutique so hipster no-one was supposed to know where it was? I wasn’t sure, but certainly, this place wasn’t easy to find, and business must not be very good. Then again, I didn’t imagine the rent was very high – if the shop owner paid rent at all – so perhaps that was how this strange little shop stayed afloat.  
A brass bell tinkled as I opened the door, the bright sound charmingly anachronistic. I glanced up at it; one side of the tiny instrument was badly dented, as if it had survived many, many years of use. If this was a hipster setup, the attention to detail was astonishing. Beyond ranks of shelves cluttered with old flotsam was a mullioned counter, and behind it sat a middle-aged woman. She was smartly dressed, but her garments belonged to another era. A peacock feather tucked into the crinoline brim of her hat bobbed jauntily as she inclined her head toward the sound of the bell.  
“Welcome,” she called, a smile claiming her face with lightswitch alacrity, “to a forgotten curio shop.”  
The shop wasn’t big, but every nook was densely packed. There were so many things crowded cheek-by-jowl I could barely register what they all were, even when I did recognise them. Some of them were familiar from history books, some from illustrated fairytales; iron heating pans for beds, different styles of Indian hookahs, and an impressive array of enamelled snuff-boxes, rich with cloisonné. The glass-bead eyes of taxidermied animals regarded me, frozen snarls on rictus faces leering through piles of old books and brass pots. I breathed musty sourness, faded perfumes, and the tang of old metal.  
“Can I help you with anything?” the woman chirruped brightly. Her accent was pleasantly transatlantic, like an old movie or radio star’s. I wondered how long she’d spent practising it.  
“Just looking, thanks,” I replied automatically, my gaze roving over various oddments.  
“That’s an Inverness cape, you know. Real bargain for ten pound,” she chattered, as my fingers brushed sable fabric, “belonged to a murdered banker.” Her eyes were slightly too small, and far too bright for the topic. “Wife did him in with a flatiron, which is over in the houseware section – still got the bloodstains on it and all.”  
“You’re pulling my leg,” I shot back, squeezing between shelves of apoplectic looking porcelain animals and painted pewter mugs.  
“Oh, I could be,” she gave me a gummy grin, then winked like a music-hall bawdy. “Or perhaps everything here really *does* have a story behind it, and you just need to suspend disbelief a little to see it.”  
So that was what this place was all about. The whole setup was carefully curated chicanery, to make you feel like you’d found something special, that you’d stumbled upon a nearly mystical place forgotten by time. Now I’d figured out the mystery, the shop seemed tawdry and overdone, the stacks of old things hackneyed and silly – just piles of junk with exorbitant price tags.  
And yet, I still wanted something from the shop. Whenever I went on my random excursions through the city, I liked to collect little keepsakes. Sometimes it was the skeleton of a leaf from an overgrown cemetery, other times it was a pleasingly smooth pebble, or an oddly shaped fragment of driftwood, wearing the contours of a tiny dragon’s skull.  
Some tarnished jewellery hung from the antlers of a stag, each piece carefully hooked over the spreading tines. None of the earrings matched; each had lost a twin somewhere in its journey through people’s lives, and I felt an odd pang of sadness for these old things. Not only had each lost its mate, but they had been abandoned by those who had once cherished them.  
From the crown tine dangled a pearl earring, its silver chasing and hook wire almost black with age and neglect. It was quite large; far larger than a conventional pearl, and warped, its shape more lozenge than sphere. On closer inspection, I could see the crack that ran from the base to the top, a zig-zag hairline of black that seemed a testament to how unloved it had become.  
But the tiny paper tag tied to it said that it was only two pound, so I lifted it off the antlers and took it to the counter, the mother-of-pearl warm in my palm.  
“What’s the story behind this one, then?” I asked casually, careful not to let my jaded thoughts colour my voice.  
“Oh, this is a pretty one,” the woman cooed, reaching under the counter for some rose-tinted tissue paper, “it belonged to a courtesan who frequented the palaces of King George the Third. Whilst she was not as lovely as her peers, her charm and wit were without parallel. Thus, she swindled the fortunes out of dozens of noblemen.”  
“I like her already,” I replied, smiling despite myself. The keen eyes of the proprietress held mine for a moment.  
“I think it’s entirely mutual – that’s why her earring chose you.”  
Pleasant tingles crawled across my scalp as I watched the woman’s deft hands wrap the object, then place it in a tiny box.  
“Here you go, miss. That’ll be two pound.”  
Strangely thrilled by the whole experience, I handed over a fiver and told her to keep the change. As I left the shop, my fingers wiggled an uncharacteristic little wave, and I heard myself promise the woman that I’d visit again sometime soon.

   
The earring matched none of the jewellery I owned, so instead of hooking it through my ear, I twisted the silver wire around a necklace chain and let it hang as a pendant. Although I didn’t believe the stories of the curio shop’s owner, my mind wandered in those spare moments between work and responsibility, imagining the remarkable woman my new bauble purportedly belonged to.  
In my mind’s eye, she was a short thing, with hips wide enough to be embarrassing, and a pot belly squashed flat by layers of clever corsetry. Just as the saleswoman had said, she wasn’t beautiful in the slightest, possessing none of the aesthetic qualities our modern sensibilities would deem ‘conventionally attractive’. But her face was animated, cheerful, and stamped with a lively wit that could be read in every tilt of her too-plump lips and every quirk of her thick eyebrows. I envisaged her talking to rich men sporting elaborate, pre-Victorian costumes, her kohl-lined, liquid-brown eyes pulling them under her spell like the *Rusalka* of Slavic folklore.  
As I went about my day-to-day business, I let her imagined presence whisper through my thoughts, and I began to play a game with myself, where I would try to react and respond to people as though I were the mysterious courtier.  
To my surprise, I was actually quite good at playing the part.  
Oh, I didn’t entrap men and take their money like she had – of course I didn’t! But as I grew enamoured with the role I was playing, as her honey words drizzled from my lips more and more often, I found myself the object of a *lot* of male attention. After I took home the third suitor in as many days, after we made love like frenzied teenagers, I started to wonder about my sudden change of romantic fortune.  
Was the earring to blame, or was this all just me?  
Whatever the case, it was time to pay another visit to the curio shop.

   
I was almost surprised that it was still in the same dilapidated arcade, that the homely golden glow of light still spilled from those cluttered display windows. I think I had almost expected it to have disappeared, or that I had imagined the whole thing, and I would be met with nothing but a dark, smelly alley. Smiling to myself at the lively tinkle of the brass bell, I entered the shop and greeted the proprietor with all the newfound warmth of my adopted persona.  
“You’re enjoying it, then?” she asked, nodding at the pearl around my neck.  
I had the good grace to blush, caught out in my self-indulgent roleplay.  
“It’s fine, love,” she assured me, “they all like to come out and play, those that owned them. It’s naught to be ashamed of.”  
I wanted to ask her if it was real, if some fragment of the souls of the owners truly persisted in their lost possessions – or if this was all part of her shtick; the mysterious forgotten curio shop that sold nearly magical items. But I couldn’t find the words, even with my new gift of the gab. Trying not to embarrass myself further, I held my tongue and quietly browsed the overstacked shelves for a while.  
“May I ask what this is?” I hesitated, then continued, “and to whom did it belong?”  
“Ah,” replied the woman, “that, my dear, is a silver chafing dish, formerly owned by one of the finest cooks in London. Even during the leanest of times, she always served marvellous meals in it, notably filled with the most succulent meats.”  
As her artfully-accented words washed over me, I felt those same pleasant tingles creep from the nape of my neck to the top of my head, where they spread and danced like warming, pretty wildfire.  
“I’ll take it,” I told her, lifting it carefully from where it rested atop a teetering pile of junk.  
“You haven’t even looked at the price, love.”  
I that instant I was all courtesan, confident and charming,  
“There is no need to, madame! This object was meant to be with me.”  
Saying nothing, she wrapped the tarnished dish in that same rose-tinted tissue, her efficient hands and the whispery crumple of paper amplifying that orgasmic feeling radiating from my scalp.  
I don’t even remember what I paid for it. I barely recall leaving the arcade, the brown paper bag clutched to my chest like a precious child.

   
Even though the dish stood crooked, one leg shorter than the others, everything I made in it tasted *divine*. If I broiled even plain carrots in its inner dish, they melted in the mouth, their sweetness and most pleasant flavour notes amplified to the perfect culinary pitch. The cook herself lingered in my mind, her massive, homely presence hovering behind me as I salted and spiced different dishes. Disapproving frowns let me know that I shouldn’t use this or that ingredient, and silent laughs that set her impressive jowls wobbling told me when I was on the right track.  
The first party at my house was a roaring success. Between the fantastic food and my newfound socialite graces, the last guests didn’t leave until well after midnight, asking when I would host again – and could they get the recipe for that incredible salmon soufflé?  
But after a few weeks of constant parties, each culminating in all-night fucking with the most eligible male (and sometimes female) guests, I was utterly *exhausted*.  
Yet I wasn’t ready to let it go, and neither were my two skullmates, the Courtesan and the Cook. I just needed something to pick me up, to give me the pep and stamina of a twenty-year-old athlete, instead of the chubby, thirty-something office-worker I really was.  
I barely remember making the journey to the curio shop, nor did I register the jolly tinkle of the bell on the door this time. I must have looked haggard, even though I was dressed as smartly as I’d ever been. My thoughts rose sluggishly through a murky haze of fatigue, always a step behind events as they transpired.  
“You look like you need a little vim and vigour in your life,” chattered the canny proprietress, taking me by the hand and leading me to a corner of the shop I’d yet to browse, “let’s see what we can do for you.”  
In this nook, all manner of men’s accoutrements were gathered and displayed; from stained silk bowties to antique gorgets on brass chains greened with verdigris. My tired eyes roved over the assortment, not quite processing why I was here and what I could possibly want with such masculine objects.  
“I think you’ll like this one, my lovely,” crooned the owner, the delicious lilt of her voice melting through my head like a warm hit of heroin.  
“Yes, I think I will,” I replied, as she closed my shaking hands around a silver letter opener much the worse for wear, its point snapped off and the nacre handle cracked in two places.  
“He was a famous pugilist, the fellow who owned it,” she explained, leading me to the counter, “a bare-knuckle champion who fought round after round without tiring. He never lost a bout.”  
I already knew that, because he was already there, watching money change hands – far too much money for a useless old letter opener. He was a massive, ropy bear of a fellow, nose so broken it was nearly flat. Yet his curling, waxed moustache was pert and jaunty, at odds with his otherwise thuggish appearance.  
As I left the shop, I could almost feel those huge, sunken-knuckled hands kneading the fatigue and tension out of my shoulders. My step was already lighter and my spirit freshened by the time I reached the street.

   
He was always there, the massive boxer, his indomitable will propping up mine whenever I faltered. I kept the letter opener tucked into the top of my garter – the latter an affectation from the courtesan – and the cool silver pressed against my flesh was an energising balm.  
The trio of personalities worked perfectly together. Like a well-oiled engine crew servicing some elaborate, chattering machine from a previous era, each of them played a vital part in keeping it all running, leaving me with little to do but observe and enjoy. But such elaborate engagements didn’t come cheaply, and I wasn’t a wealthy woman. When my bank account was finally reduced to a string of zeroes, the courtesan shushed my panicked cries and had me lift my mattress. Beneath it was a thick layer of banknotes, the money she had been taking from all the eligible suitors – all willing gifts befitting a lady, she assured me. I didn’t question whether I believed her or not.  
Men no longer graced my bed, however, for the pugilist would have no truck with any of that. Women only, he insisted, and he came to dominate all bedroom activities, while I eagerly drank the oceans of pleasure he drenched me with. When the chokings and beatings started, I didn’t care; this was *his* time and he could do with it what he pleased. Besides, all the women consented to it, with the slippery words of the courtesan in their ears encouraging and cajoling them.  
Left free to roam my own thoughts, I found I could explore theirs, too. My brain felt like a boarding-house, each of them taking up residence in a particular room, filling those spaces with memories of times lost to history. I danced complicated pavanes in the court of King George, and I walked the streets of Victorian London, hawking pies of strange, tender meats. Best of all was reliving the glory days of the pugilist. I felt the fists of stevedores and sailors break upon my iron jaw, watched my own sledgehammer hands crush their noses and cheekbones, smelled the blood and sawdust, and heard the animal screams of the crowd.  
But I delved further than I should have.  
Murder was far easier in those times, before forensics and detectives. Nobody cared much if some villain’s daughter was found strangled in a ditch, or if some nobleman’s mistress and ill-gotten child perished from another mysterious form of consumption. The courtesan’s first poisoning had been the wife of a minor merchant, not an enemy, simply someone who was in the way of her plans. As the pages of her memories turned, they grew progressively blacker, whole chapters of callous murders no longer discriminating between women and children.  
They were all just obstacles between her and her burgeoning wealth.  
I fled then, into the warm, homely memories of the cook, redolent with the comforting aromas of fresh-baked bread and rich, spiced stews. She was a helper of women, this one. A feminist, well before such a word existed – her skills extending beyond the kitchen and into counselling and minor surgeries. Women knocked on her door during the darkest hours of night, their bellies swollen with illegitimate heirs; and she would take the shame out of them, allowing them to live a life free of the stigma of bastard babies.  
I watched her reverently carry the bloodied remains of a twenty-week foetus away from its exhausted mother, who lay blissfully asleep on a crimson-stained pallet in the cook’s scullery. I knew what she was about to do before it happened, and I pleaded with the woman’s memory not to do it; to change history, to leave it at the point where she had helped instead of committing the final depraved act in her arsenal.  
But the past cannot be changed. And so, into the dish the dead child went, the seething water parting London’s tenderest meat from friable, nascent bones – a skeleton that would never thrive and strengthen on its mother’s milk.  
I fled then, down the corridors of my mind, away from the twin evils I had so readily invited into me. I ran back toward my own memories, strangely distant, mothballed and dusty in the lower recesses of my head. The pugilist stopped me, his broad, tattooed chest filling the narrow passage and his jackhammer fist knocking me off my feet.  
He bore me over one mighty shoulder, into his own chamber of horrors, piled haphazardly with the bruise-necked corpses of girls and women.  
“You knew,” he rumbled, the resonance of his voice a vibration in my bowels, “you knew from the start I was a killer.”  
“No,” I wept, “No!”  
But that was a lie.

   
The curio shop seemed impossible to find this time, the curling, confusing streets of my city even more misleading than normal. As I walked, finding dead end after dead end, they fought for control of me, the trio in my head. The pugilist battered my synapses with his powerful knuckles, while the courtesan drizzled deception over my bruised brain, sticky and sweet as a Russian honey cake layered with lies.  
But the cook, for all her own evils, did not see herself as the others did. For her, there had been no complicit embrace of darkness; in her own mind, she was still protected by a purity of purpose. All along, she had only been helping other women to escape from the tyranny of the opposite sex. And if the hideous conclusion she had wrought from that brought some personal gain, well, that simply allowed her more resources to help her poor unfortunates.  
And so it was that she placed herself between my thoughts and theirs, her corpulent bulk absorbing the hammering blows of the fighter, and her cavernous mouth shouting down the lies.  
The entrance to the alley was suddenly *there*, a gaping brick void, and I ran down it before it could disappear. I ran up the graffitied stairs, through the second moss-carpeted alley, and stumbled out into the dimly lit arcade. The lambent glow of the curio shop window was as welcome as a candle in a moorland hut, guiding the lost traveller home.  
As the brass bell tinkled, the clamour in my head subsided, and all three intruders fell silent.  
“I don’t take back items,” the proprietress said, before I could speak. An unfamiliar hardness stiffened her voice. “But I can sell you another. Something which will help you control them.”  
“No! I’ll not buy any more of your cursed junk!”  
“Then enjoy what remains of your wretched new life,” she snarled, all her affability fled. “Best of luck staying their killer instincts.”  
Sapped of the pugilist’s indomitable energy, my knees and hands trembled, weak with exhaustion.  
“Perhaps they’ve killed here already,” her laugh was brittle as she pushed past the counter and waded through all the junk, “Or should I say, perhaps *you* have. How many strangled girls are hidden beneath your bed? How many wives have died of mysterious ailments after you’ve finished with their husbands?”  
She was close enough now that I could smell her breath, heavy with coffee and cinnamon, and something rank and old.  
*“How many babies have you boiled?”*  
Yanking the necklace off, I hurled it at her. It struck her cheek, then fell to the floor.  
“Oh no. You can’t get rid of them like that. Those people are part of you now.”  
The shop was spinning around me, leering animal heads, flashes of old brass, sparkling, smeared trails of coloured glass and shiny tat. I struggled to steady myself.  
“Then how? Just tell me how!”  
Reaching inside the front pocket of her neatly tailored dress, she pulled out a long silver chain, from which dangled a set of well-polished keys.  
“The shop is for sale. Should you wish to buy it.”  
I stared at her, dizzy, not comprehending, as she jingled the keys, the sound uncannily similar to the pretty chime of the bell.  
“And the owner of the shop cannot be controlled by the objects.”  
I licked my dry lips. With the familiar eloquence of the courtesan lost, my voice sounded wobbly and pathetic,  
“What… what will it cost me?”  
“Everything. Everything that is yours.”

   
She walked out of the shop, wearing my clothes, my face and my flesh. She was awkward in them still; but everything that had been mine – everything that had been *me*, from the birthmark on my wrist to the memories of my fifth birthday – was now hers.  
She would adjust quickly – and I knew she would thrive; finally freed from her imprisonment.  
And in turn, everything that was hers is now mine.  
There are *thousands* of items in the shop; and as my old memories fade and wither, hers continue to blossom, spooling their secrets and stories into me. Thus, I have embraced my role, or it has embraced me, as the new owner of this place, this forgotten curio shop. And I’m destined to remain here until some poor sap chances upon the brick archway, and is finally ensnared.  
Knowing the truth of it all, I’ve given you the choice that I did not have. Knowledge is supposedly powerful. And perhaps you have the strength of will that I didn’t. Perhaps you’ll stop at one object, and never buy a second. Perhaps you’ll even have the fortitude to endure two?  
Whatever the case, you know the dangers.  
But if you *do* decide to buy something, if the objects choose you, then I’m here. I’ll be more than happy to help, if you’re the right person to find me.

I tried drinking prune juice but it made me so unbelievably gassy it was honestly more painful than just dealing with being constipated so i haven't tried again.
