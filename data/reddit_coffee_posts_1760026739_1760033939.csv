1o2dh0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatisthatmovie/comments/1o2dh0x/looking_for_a_movie/,Looking for a movie,"Hi all!

I am looking for a movie that has this scene:

There are several (younger/students) people who go into a diner and order food/coffee.
They are a mix of white and black people, i especially remember there being a black woman/girl.

The era of the movie is when there was still segregation or it had just ended. I think this movie is situated in the southeast of America.

The people in the diner are met with hatefull comments, one of the people (the black girl) is being spat on and at one point there is hot coffee being thrown in the face of them.
They are then thrown out of the diner.

I thought the movie was about the Savannah sit-in but that turns me to the movie Midnight in the garden of good and evil, and this is not the movie is am looking for.

Can someone help me find this?",1,1760033770.0,whatisthatmovie,1,1.0,False

 I know what my trigger points are, cheese,  coffee,  stress, lack of sleep, strong bleach cleaners. 
I try to avoid them but sometimes it can't be helped.
On day 3 of my migraine today. 
Normally take co codamal and apply some heat ointment on my forehead to ease the pain but nothing really works. I end up burning the skin from my forehead with the ointment. 
Get the normal sensitivity to light and smells.
Feel weak and really gassy burping all the time. Sometimes when its really bad I throw up. 
Had migraines since I was in my 30's, now Im in my 50s.
 Get them about once a month for 3 days.
On day 3 when they go its like a godsend. Just waiting for that moment now. ",1,1760033762.0,migraine,1,1.0,False

1o2dfnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1o2dfnv/thinking_of_leaving_my_job_need_opinions/,Thinking of leaving my job; need opinions.,"Hello!
I truly need some opinions and potentially advice on if I should stay at my current place or start looking elsewhere. 

About me: graduated with honors and have a bachelors degree - which I received last year. (Was an older student) Have 10+ years experience service/hospitality background. 

Moved to the west coast and started looking for work. NOTHING. 6 months of looking and I was finally taken part time in a sales position. Which I worked up to full time hire after 4 months. Was a brutal period for me. 
Regardless, I am over my expectation for their goals. I am currently at 150% to my target (over my target) and reached my first million $ in sales in just 4 months. Sooner than some of the seniors. I have great reviews and I work very hard. 

Pros: I make about 100k a year. So I finally feel like I can breathe. 

Cons: it’s brutal schedule. My manager believes in split days off. Refuses 2 days off in a row. Only 1 Saturday off a month. If you want to request 2 days off in a row or any vacation, prepare to work 7 days in a row. Multiple employees have brought it up with HR but they don’t do anything about it. I’m actually physically and mentally exhausted. Especially considering we take our work phones home and have to answer client calls off the clock. No additional pay. Sometimes we have to come in on our day off for a client or you lose a sale. I’ve been reprimanded for not answering client emails during my vacation on THE DAY of my cousins wedding where I was the bridesmaid. 

My schedule changes every week. But I’ll have Monday off and Thursday off. Sometimes. Monday off / Wednesday off. Or Tuesday / Saturday off. But never together. It’s her personal philosophy. 

We MUST have hair and makeup done and dry cleaned uniform. Nails done etc. I’m exhausted by the amount of perfection. I can do it, but again the schedule is killing me. 

Recently I’ve been in the middle of moving apartments to be able to walk to work. I’ve come in 5 min late a few times this week. But I never call out and I always come in or stay late if they need me to. 
My manager has reprimanded me about my hours and that I’ve been coming in late. 

I work either 9:30a - 6:30p OR 12:30-9pm 
Am I being a baby about this ? 
Do I have it good or am I gaslighting myself?

There is no growth in this job because it’s the only one in the area. I don’t want to wait for 2 years for management if someone finally retires. I don’t want to work this schedule for 2 years + either. I’m clearly good at my job and fantastic as sales and client experience. 

I’m concerned about the job market and leaving but also I need someone to tell me if this job is crazy situation?

I cannot have a life like this. I’m chronically exhausted. And I’ve been having heart palpitations from coffee and stress. My days off I’m glued to my work phone just in case. I can’t travel. I can’t stay up late. I’m too tired for date night or gym. I can’t make new friends as my schedule is different every week so I can’t join a club or meetup. I don’t feel like I have control over my own life. Not even my days off. Every evening feels like Sunday night. But I’m financially secure for the first time in my life and I can walk to work. 

I wanted to do my masters but I can’t with this schedule. So I’m saving money right now instead. Are there better options?

1o2df09,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1o2df09/im_confused/,I'm confused,"I was standing in the elevator to go to my apartment, I had just done grocery shopping. Another man came into the elevator. He made a remark, just a little chat that I responded to. It was a friendly conversation, just polite small talk. Then he asked if I wanted to have a cup of coffee with him at my home. Quite taken aback by this question, I said yes. Once in my house, we got drinks and continued talking. The conversation was okay, I thought, well, it’s a bit weird, but this is also how you can meet a neighbor. After five or maybe ten minutes of talking, he said, “You smiled at me so sweetly in the elevator, that must have been especially just for me, you think I’m cute too, it was such a sweet smile, you don’t give that to just anyone.” And then he kissed me. It all happened very quickly, I was quite overwhelmed. But also surprised, I thought I was very ugly at the time, so it was nice that someone could find me attractive, but also quite overwhelmed, I didn’t find him attractive or anything. And it all happened very fast. He also took off my shirt, which I didn’t like, it was so bright in the room, it was the middle of the day, and I was ashamed of my body. He wanted to take off my bra, but I didn’t want that, he said something reassuring and took it off anyway. I didn’t like that he saw my naked body, I was ashamed and maybe smiled a bit out of discomfort. We were still on the couch, then he guided me, half-naked, to my bed, it all happened very quickly, I was still ashamed of my body. It happened al so quickly! He undressed me and himself too. I just went along, very passively, but I don’t know why. I would never have sex with someone in this way. I don’t remember much about the sex itself, just fragments. I know I didn’t like the oral part, but I just did it anyway. I don’t have much feeling about the rest. After the sex, it was a bit awkward, he dressed quickly and left quickly too. At the door, he was very friendly again, I was friendly back, I don’t know why. I don't know, was this SA? I didn't do anything to stop it, I just did everything he said, but I can't remember why, why would I do that, is it because I wanted to? Or  was I SAd?",1,1760033638.0,sexualassault,1,1.0,False

1o2d4oc,https://www.reddit.com/r/compoundedtirzepatide/comments/1o2d4oc/losing_verrry_slowly/,Losing verrry slowly,"I just took my 9th shot yesterday, and so far have only lost 10 lb. I was told by the Pomegranate doctor that the weight loss would speed up once I went to the higher dose of 4.5 mg, but I have found that the opposite is true. 

I'm not in a race to lose this, and I am experiencing the side effects of no food noise, slower digestion, etc. 

In the morning I usually have a large coffee with a scoop of collagen and two or three tablespoons of heavy cream. This gives me about 18 g of protein and roughly 120 or 130 calories. I have a late lunch early dinner and the calories in that are probably 700 to 900. Add a small snack of 100 to 200 calories.

The calorie amounts given to me with my Pomegranate consultation are between 1100 and 1300 per day.

The last couple of days I have not been getting in much water, and I've had a knee injury that has kept me from doing any exercise, but I still think I should be losing a little more than just 1.2 lb a week. 

Is there anything I should monitor or change? I was thinking about calling the Pomegranate doctor and asking for her advice.

I was losing more steadily on 2.5 mg. The current plan with Pomegranate is 4.5 mg for 4 weeks and then increase that to, I think, 7.5 mg.

Next week I have a semi-casual meeting at a starbucks that I am a bit nervous about. The problem is that I have a medical condition that makes it so I can't process sucrose sugar, lactose, or starch. Artificial sweeteners I have to use minimally as well. I jokingly refer to it as being ""Everything intolerant"".  I'm not allergic, trace amounts I can tolerate, so I am not worried about cross-contamination.

So far I have the following ideas:

1: One thing I can have is grape juice as it is almost entirely mono-saccharide sugar (fructose). Could I bring in a little 12-oz unopened bottle of Welch's 100% grape juice. Have them steam it and add a sugar-free cinnamon dulce syrup to it. (I might be able to have regular syrups if they use corn syrup instead of cane sugar)

2: Order just a water/bring my own drink. It feels like this is a bit tacky. Maybe that is just me.

3: Do you have any other non-coffee/caffeinated drink suggestions? I can have honey (real honey), and am usually okay with High Fructose corn syrup. There might be an obvious answer that I am just not thinking of.

1o2d3ce,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1o2d3ce/day_8_sobriety_results/,Day 8 sobriety results,"Disclosure: I saw myself becoming a heavy drinker I.e. 3-5 drinks(bourbon/whiskey)/ night. Sometimes I would go a day or two without drinking but easily 5 days a week. I understand I may not be an alcoholic but I saw myself on that path. This the sobriety challenge of 30days to see if I have it in check or if I’m addicted. 

I in now way am comparing/contrasting my habits to anyone. I just noticed that I was slipping out of control. Here is what I have noticed in the past eight days of nothing but water and coffee and occasional energy drink. 

Sleep: it does take longer to get to sleep but my REM when I do get to sleep is great. I wake up refreshed.

Mind: my clarity is coming back with each day. Memory is getting better. What is the best part is when I drank my thoughts were always negative. Thus, I have a more upbeat mood and my relationship with gf has drastically improved. I am not nitpicking her or being rude or confrontational when I was buzzed or drun and eating everything in the house lol.

Bowel movements are now back to regular every morning.

Food: I am eating everything in the house. I am inky 5’8 175 but I could see that if I don’t exercise to some extent that I will need to curb my intake. 

That’s it for now. I will post another update in 8 days. 

If this helps anyone or you feel encouraged in any way, I hope you get the help or can lean on someone as a support. Also, do not do it cold turkey if you drink more than me. Seek medical advice to get to sobriety. 

You can do it but you got to be purposeful.  

Write out projects that you need done during the time you would drink. Pick up a hobby etc. anything to keep you occupied. It helps me.

The kind of conversation where both people can just exhale and be themselves. If that’s something you’ve been missing too, I’d really like to hear from you.

I’m 27, living in England, and I run my own business which keeps me creative and lets me set my own pace. Outside of work, I’m usually cooking something from scratch, baking when the mood strikes, or out getting some fresh air on a run or hike. I travel whenever I can, even if it’s just to a new coffee spot in a town I haven’t wandered through yet. I find a lot of peace in the small, quiet things.

I care a lot about emotional maturity. Not in a heavy way, but in the sense that I want to connect with people who aren’t afraid of depth, and who can hold space for the lightness too. I tend to connect most with people who are self-aware, thoughtful, kind without needing a reason, and naturally curious about the world and other people. I like when people are open about who they are, even if they’re still figuring some of it out. If you’re someone who wants to be truly seen and is open to doing the same in return, we’ll probably understand each other.

I’m not in a rush and I’m not here for attention. Just a simple, steady kind of presence with someone who values the same. The kind of connection that grows naturally, without needing to chase it.

Location: 10/10. I looked at the neighboring resorts, and I don’t see how any could match this view. Every room is an ocean view room.

Service: 1000000/10. They really go above and beyond to service you, always with a smile. We just came back from Hawaii, and it’s incomparable. I’m always at a loss for how well they treated us while not requiring a tip or anything extra.

Entertainment: 7/10 This is probably their only weak spot. The first show was a magic show, which was terrific. Everything that followed was pretty lackluster. They could also really benefit from a proper sports bar that’s open all day. We didn’t find ourselves bored, but we only booked three nights.

Beach: 9/10. They work hard in the mornings, cleaning up the seaweed. There are always lawn chairs available, and the spot is on the calm side.

Rooms: 9/10. They upgraded us to a corner suite, and it was huge. The two tubs were great. The rainfall shower was very clean and stocked with wine, beer, soda, espresso, etc. Room service was the best we ever dealt with. Our only gripe was that the pillows were hard.

Food: 8/10 We loved the majority of the food. There's so much to choose from, and of course, some can be hit or miss. The breakfast buffet has so much, but it didn’t appeal to us. Different strokes. The American bistro restaurant was amazing. The coffee bar is great. The snacks are a little lackluster.

9/10 overall. It’s our first all-inclusive, but we travel a lot. Iberostar Coral set the bar high, and we can’t wait to return.

by Preston Dennett

All UFO encounters are interesting, but perhaps the most fascinating is when UFOs land and humanoids come out! Here are ten cases of UFO landings from across the world including the United States, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Spain, Norway, Finland, Scotland, France and England. They span over a period of five decades. They involve a wide variety of humanoid figures. Many are multiple witness cases. Almost all of them involve some form hard evidence such as landing traces, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, psychic effects and physiological reactions. Some include government involvement and even disturbing threats from apparent men in black.

JUL 23, 1947, PITANGA BRAZIL: Topographer Jose C. Higgins hears a high-pitched hum. Suddenly a metallic craft lands next to him and out come three beautiful ETs wearing weird spacesuits. Jose founds himself surrounded by them. To his relief, they appear to be friendly. Feeling fear, he retreats and watches them from a distance as they begin playing like small children.

AUG 1960, NEWCASTLE, NSW AUSTRALIA: Helen Aldridge is awakened by a buzzing noise coming from outside her home. Looking out the window, she sees a craft shaped like a toy top landing in her backyard. Out steps a humanoid dressed in an olive-green jumpsuit. To her shock, it climbs over her fence and approaches right up to her window.

JUL 31, 1966, PRESQUE ISLE STATE PARK, PA: When their car gets stuck in the sand, Gerald LaBelle goes for help, leaving behind Betty Klem, Doug Tibbets, Anita Haifley and her two children. Without warning, a UFO lands in the forest next to them. Police arrive and leave with Doug to investigate. At this point, a huge hairy humanoid emerges from the forest and attacks the car. Before long officers from Project Blue Book arrive to investigate.

AUG 29, 1967, CUSSAC, FRANCE: When 13-year-old Francois Delpeuch and his little sister Ann-Marie (age 9) go to retrieve the family cows, they come upon a huge glowing sphere and four small humanoids walking around beneath it. When they approach for a closer look, the strange beings notice the two children and begin floating one by one back into the craft.

FEB 5, 1971, KINNULA, FINLAND: Two forestry workers (Peter Aliranta and Esko Sneck) get the shock of their lives when a UFO lands next to them in the forest. A small 4-foot-tall being emerges and approaches Peter. When the being turns around to enter the craft, Peter rushes forward and grabs the ET by the foot. It’s a decision that he will regret for a long time.

NOV 14, 1976, WINCHESTER, ENGLAND: Joyce Bowles is driving home. Her friend Edwin Pratt is in the passenger seat. They are concerned to see a UFO dropping down from the sky ahead of them on the road. Suddenly their car steers itself off the road. When they finally get it to stop, they see a UFO blocking the roadway and humanoids looking out the windows at them. Then one emerges from the craft, walks right up to them and stares at them fixedly. Their strange adventure has only begun.

MAY 18, 1977, ELGIN, SCOTLAND: Karen McLennan and Fiona Morrison (both 10-years-old) are playing near their homes when they hear a soft humming noise in the woods. They go to investigate and come upon a landed craft. Standing next to it is a tall slender man dressed in a silvery jumpsuit. As the man walks towards them, the girls flee. When they turn around, they see the craft flying off. But when they get home, they learn there are more witnesses. And then the threats start coming in.

SEP 18, 1978, SAN GIORGIO DI NOGARO, ITALY: Railway employee Giorgio Filiputti only wants to enjoy a quiet day of fishing. But it’s not to be. He hears a strange noise and an odd breeze. Going to investigate, he comes upon a landed craft. A weird 4-foot-tall humanoid looks surprised to see Giorgio approach. He stares at Giorgio and begins to work on apparently repairing his craft.

NOV 24, 1978, GERENA, SPAIN: When four young men go hunting along the Guadiamar River, they get a lot more than they bargained for. Seeing strange lights in the forest, they come upon a landed UFO and a 7-foot-tall humanoid. The strange figure starts walking towards them. When it gets too close, the men run away in a panic. Later, strange land-traces are found.

JUL 25, 1981. STJORDAL, NORWAY: Hjordis Hokstad wants only to enjoy her morning coffee and watch the wild deer in the field behind her house. Instead she sees a landed UFO and a weird humanoid wearing a spacesuit walking around the craft. She grabs her binoculars and gets a nice close look. Little does she know, her neighbor is watching the whole thing from his house.

There is no more room for denial. The evidence for the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrials is here for those with the courage to examine it. We are not alone! We are only one of many different humanoids in a universe teeming with intelligent life.

Scotland , employed at current job for 5 years.","I’m a night cleaner and I work in a veterinary hospital , I’ve worked there for6-7 years , I found out in March that the patient care assistant and the RVN get paid a nightshift allowance of 20% , i work 11pm-7-am so definitely classed as a nightshift worker, when i asked management and HR if I receive or am entitled to a nightshift allowance I was told it’s not in my contract and I don’t get it and I asked why everyone else gets it and I was told they receive it to take them into the correct banding and then I was asked where I got my information from I said we were discussing the recent salary increase and the girls assumed I got it too since it says “nightshift” , one of the nurses is our managers best friend who sometimes shares things she shouldn’t , anyway me , the pca and the nurse got spoken to the next morning with no invite to chat nothing just that our manager came in and asked to speak to us both separately and told us we aren’t allowed to discuss salary , to which we both stated that under the equality act section 77 we are and were told it’s a grey area to which we said no it’s black and white.Fast forward 2 months later I get invited to an investigation meeting for spending excessive time in the staff room and not completing tasks which I admitted to as the offices upstairs , no one is in on the weekends so sometimes I missed it and I know I shouldn’t have but I admitted to becoming complacent due to medical issues and stress because of them , anyway my meeting concluded with a warning basically and was told it would be monitored , then in August I had my Mid year review and was told in it that management are happy with my work and  have received nothing but positive feedback about my work as the place is always spotless when I’ve been on.
To add some context I’ve always been asked by the RVN on shift when needed to help with inpatients wether it to be to distract them whilst they’re being restrained or in some cases with no pca cover to restrain and raise a vein for bloods , I used to help draw up the saline flush stronger and food drapes for kit packs for theatre (folding pieces of cloth basically) during my meeting I was told that my help was greatly appreciated but going forward I’m not allowed to make up flush or fold drapes anymore which fine okay but if I had spare time to help my colleagues and the hospital where possible , when asked about restraining or handling patients in my PDR it was stated my help with pca tasks have been greatly appreciated and some animal handling but going forward for health and safety reasons caution should be taken when handling animals due to lack of training , I have done 4 of the companies online training modules for animal handling including the vet tech and assistant module and shown and told how to do so when handling animals by the RVN , everyone in work knows I help out as when there’s no pca nurses have told me that day shift staff have said well at least you have the cleaner on to help you tonight.
Another part is that regarding the pay issue they deem my job as non clinical because I’m just a cleaner but I am the one who empties clinical waste bags and when cleaning if o find used thermometers I clean them and put them back where they’re supposed to be , finding syringes  and needles , I will take off the needle and dispose of it in the correct sharps bin and the syringe into the doop bin , I have never had any formal training on this I’ve just read the SOP’s and the bin labels as if I was to avoid this and the spiked bandages or blood soaked consumables like bandages etc and had to get someone else to come remove or deal with these items every time I came across them , no one would get any work done and if I left them I would be pulled up for not cleaning properly ,it’s the same with cleaning surfaces or floors or walls , if there’s blood or faecal matter I will clean it and not just around it , again no biohazard training has been received ,  I would say this makes my job more of a clinical support role and not just a standard cleaner or janitorial role so makes me question even more the fact that everyone else on nights gets a 20% nightshift allowance and I don’t , after questioning the pay and being told I’m not entitled I asked for a copy of my contract to which they also sent me over the variation to contract of employment I signed in 2022 stating I was going to receive a 10% increase to my annual salary (hr signed this letter) but HR told me they’d checked my contract and I do not get a nightshift allowance (again this was before my manager sent me the contract of variation and both my manager and hr told me I’m not entitled to a nightshift allowance) my payslip doesn’t say anything about this 10% as I think they’ve just added it in to my annual salary but again their payslips are so confusing I’m unsure , also don’t want to ask as I’m being scrutinised on everything I do.
Again when I had the investigation meeting at the beginning of the year it was mentioned about a bin not being emptied but only a few weeks ago I was messaged on my day off regarding “feedback” stating a bin had rubbish in it and someone complained and to empty them even if they’re only half full to which I responded saying that’s fine I understand although I do see it as a waste of bin bags but I will adhere to this from now on why was one incident an investigation meeting and one was classed as feedback.
To add on I had messaged my manager 2 days before this and told them that due to having a coil inserted and an implant removed if anything was missed it’s because I’d be taking my time due to still being very sore , she didn’t back me and still passed on said feedback.
She then openly asked me in front of 3 colleagues one of which works days and I only see for 5 minutes in the morning between me leaving and then starting their shift ; how are you feeling after your procedure , the one I don’t work with quickly jumped in asking what I had done and I was on the spot so I said I had a coil inserted to which she responded along the lines off eughh god i could never get something like that done , I did message my manager saying this made me feel uncomfortable and I’d rather not discuss my medical issue or personal issue that o discuss with her with other colleagues to which she apologised for “overstepping my boundaries and making me feel uncomfortable”.
A few weeks ago I called in sick , our protocol for nightshift are to call in by mid day , I was fine the whole day and went for a nap before work and woke up cramping and bleeding heavily so I called in sick and apologised for it being so late and was told to get better soon , a few days ago I was messaged and asked to have a catch up with my manager , he came in early and said it’s just to go over my self certificate with my line manager as i didn’t follow protocol , then I asked what does this mean and was told nothing will come of it and not to worry and I said so it’s an informal warning to which I was told yes it is but nothing is going to come of it.
I feel like ever since I raised the issue about the shift allowance I have been being scrutinised and targeted as if I’m being pushed out the door or their stacking up informal and formal grievances against me to get rid of me for petty things.
I posted a message to our workplace forum/message board a few weeks ago that someone hadn’t cleaned a coffee maker and the ground had went mouldy and stank and attached an image to which a manager immediately messaged me and asked me to remove it as it was one of the owners and he’d been off for a few weeks unwell and had clearly forgotten about it but colleagues told me he was in the building the day before I made the post and looked fine. 
So an owner can cause an infection control risk and have the evidence hidden but if I leave a bin less than half full I’m pulled up about it.
I’m basically just looking to see what people think of my situation or if I’m just imagining feeling targeted. ",2,1760032430.0,HumanResourcesUK,0,1.0,False

* style filters (photorealistic, anime, fantasy, etc.)
* detail boosting and facial refinement

You can go for anything from cinematic realism to stylized animations - whatever fits your short’s vibe.

How I build shorts with it:

1. Start with a strong idea and prompt. Example: ""A bustling coffee shop interior at morning light, realistic with steam rising from cups and people chatting."" Add details about lighting, camera angle, or mood to get more accurate results.
2. Generate the image. It only takes seconds. If it’s not perfect, tweak it using:
   * inpainting (fix specific spots)
   * outpainting (expand the scene)
   * style shifts or detail enhancement
3. Create your short. Once you’ve got your keyframes, head over to Doitong and pick an AI shorts generator. These tools can auto-animate frames, apply transitions, or add motion effects - turning your static images into smooth 15–60 second clips.

I’ve made everything from mini life hacks to short stories that rack up views because they look real and engaging.

Pro tips:

* Get specific with prompts. Mention colors, lighting, and composition to avoid bland results.
* Try multiple variations. Sometimes the best image comes on the second or third attempt.
* Usage freedom. You can use these images commercially - just double-check their terms to be safe.

FAQs:

1o2ctoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewVoyage/comments/1o2ctoa/uncover_if_seventh_generation_laundry_detergent/,Uncover If Seventh Generation Laundry Detergent Sheets Work,"Using the Seventh Generation 732913453023 laundry detergent sheets has been an interesting experience. This product combines practicality with a commitment to sustainability, all while tackling one of life’s most consistent chores—laundry. With claims of being safer for families and featuring a fresh lavender scent, I was curious to see just how much of an impact it could make, not only on my laundry habits but also on my household overall. After consistently using it for a few weeks, I have compiled my thoughts on its strengths, potential caveats, and overall performance.

**Eco-Friendly and Compact Design**  
The first thing that struck me about these detergent sheets was how compact and lightweight they are. They arrive in a box that takes up significantly less space than a traditional liquid detergent bottle or bulky powder box. From a storage perspective, this is incredibly convenient for smaller laundry rooms or apartments. The eco-friendly angle is another standout. The packaging contains no excessive plastic, aligning perfectly with efforts to reduce household waste. Every time I see these sheets, I feel slightly better knowing I’ve made a decision that benefits the environment.

**Ease of Use**  
Using the product couldn’t be simpler. Traditional detergent measurements often feel like a guessing game, but with these sheets, I just toss one or two into the machine based on the load size, and I’m done. There’s no mess, no spills, and no awkwardly pouring liquid that drips onto countertops. They dissolve easily in both hot and cold water, which was one of my main concerns before trying them. Even sensitive settings on my washing machine didn’t seem to create any issues with the sheets dissolving fully.

**Key Benefits**  
- Fresh lavender scent that’s not overpowering.  
- Compact and eco-friendly packaging.  
- Easy, mess-free application for all load sizes.

**Effectiveness on Stains**  
Being marketed as strong enough to handle tough stains, I put these detergent sheets to the ultimate test: my son’s soccer uniform. It’s no secret that grass stains and mud are almost impossible to remove, yet these sheets held their own. While I wouldn’t say they worked miracles (some faint traces of the most stubborn stains remained), they did better than many other detergents I’ve tried in the past. Everyday stains like coffee and chocolate were no match, though, leaving me quite impressed.

**Scent and Sensitivity**  
The lavender scent adds a nice touch without being too overwhelming. I usually steer clear of scented detergents due to a family member with sensitive skin, but these had no adverse effects. This product is free of dyes and artificial fragrances, so it strikes a good balance between appealing aroma and safety. My kids, who often itch after wearing clothes washed in other detergents, had no complaints after switching to this one.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Struggles with very stubborn stains like grass or grease.  
- Each sheet may not be enough for very large or heavily soiled loads.  

**Challengers in the Market**  
Looking at competitors in the laundry detergent segment, this product holds its ground well. In comparison, liquid detergents like Tide and Persil still dominate with their advanced stain-removal formulas, particularly for grease-heavy challenges. However, traditional detergents are bulkier and prone to spills and wasted product. The eco-friendly nature puts Seventh Generation ahead of those brands when assessing environmental impact. Moreover, other detergent sheets, such as Tru Earth’s version, offer similar compactness but carry a higher price point for fewer loads, making this product an appealing alternative.

**Worth Every Penny**  
When comparing to other products, the Seventh Generation 732913453023 detergent sheets are worth it for those looking to combine ease and sustainability in their laundry routine. Other brands may offer a marginally better stain-fighting power, but they fall short in eco-friendliness and practical usability. No exact price is set in stone due to fluctuating costs, but it often leans toward fair pricing for the value it delivers. For a clean conscience—and clean clothes—it’s a worthwhile investment.

We weren’t fighting exactly, but that spark — the connection — started fading. Our conversations turned into checklists: bills, chores, schedules. He wasn’t as affectionate anymore, and I started overthinking everything.

I remember one night, we were watching TV and I looked over at him — he was right there, but I felt completely alone. That’s when it really hit me that I was losing him, and I had no idea how to fix it.

I tried all the typical things — dressing up more, planning date nights, even giving him more “space” like some friends suggested. But the harder I tried, the more distant he seemed. It was exhausting. I started wondering if maybe he’d just fallen out of love.

[Then one evening, while venting to my cousin over coffee, she told me about something she’d stumbled on called His Secret Obsession. She said it completely changed how she understood her partner — that it wasn’t about manipulation or tricks, but about understanding what really drives emotional connection for men.](https://freezegluco.com/hissecretobsession.html)

At first, I rolled my eyes. I’ve read enough “relationship advice” online to know most of it’s fluff. But my cousin swore it made a huge difference in her marriage, so I figured I didn’t have much to lose.

When I started going through it, I was surprised by how simple — yet deep — some of the ideas were. It made me realize how often I’d been communicating love in ways that didn’t really resonate with him. It wasn’t that he didn’t care — he just needed to feel needed and valued in a way I hadn’t been expressing.

I started applying some of the things I learned slowly, without making it obvious. Little things like how I phrased appreciation, how I listened, or when I backed off instead of pushing during tough conversations. Within a couple of weeks, the change was noticeable. He started initiating affection again, planning things for us, and actually talking — like the guy I fell in love with years ago.

The craziest part? I stopped feeling anxious all the time. Once I understood what was really happening under the surface, it was like all the second-guessing disappeared.

--------------------------------------------------------------

<div>If you’re dreaming of a space that combines rustic charm with modern elegance, farmhouse barndominiums are an exciting solution. These unique structures mix the traditional features of a barn with the comforts of modern living, providing a perfect blend of style and functionality. Here are some creative ideas and designs to inspire your farmhouse barndominium project.

### Embrace Open Spaces

One of the hallmarks of a farmhouse barndominium is its open concept layout. This design encourages natural light and airflow while making the most of the square footage. Consider incorporating:

- High ceilings with exposed beams, which give a spacious feeling and showcase rustic elements.
- Large windows that not only let in plenty of sunlight but also offer stunning views of the surrounding landscape.
- A seamless flow between the kitchen, dining, and living areas, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.

### Blend Modern and Rustic Elements

Combining modern and rustic design elements can create a unique aesthetic that feels both cozy and chic. Here are some ways to do this:

- Use reclaimed wood in furniture pieces or as accent walls to introduce a natural feel.
- Pair industrial lighting fixtures with farmhouse tables to bridge the gap between styles.
- Incorporate modern amenities, like a sleek kitchen with stainless steel appliances, alongside vintage-inspired hardware.

### Incorporate Natural Materials

Natural materials play a crucial role in the barndominium's appeal. They create a sense of warmth and connection to nature, which is essential in rural designs. Consider integrating:

- Stone and brick accents on exterior walls to create a strong and rustic façade.
- Natural wood for flooring and cabinetry, which adds warmth and beauty to living spaces.
- Organic textiles such as cotton or linen for upholstery and decor to complement the earthy tones.

### Design Functional Outdoor Spaces

Outdoor living is a vital aspect of farmhouse barndominiums. Creating functional outdoor areas can greatly enhance your lifestyle. Consider the following:

- A spacious porch or deck where you can enjoy mornings with a cup of coffee or evenings with friends.
- Landscaping that features native plants and flowers that require little maintenance and celebrate your local environment.
- An outdoor fireplace or kitchen for entertaining and cooking outdoors, making your barndominium an ideal gathering spot.

### Include Multi-Functional Rooms

In a farmhouse barndominium, creating multi-functional spaces is vital for maximizing your living area. Here are some ideas for versatile rooms:

- A home office that doubles as a guest room with a fold-out couch or murphy bed.
- A family room that can be transformed into a game room or media center with built-in storage for games and tech.
- A combination mudroom and laundry area that provides storage for outdoor gear while keeping laundry tasks organized.

### Focus on Energy Efficiency

Modern farmhouse barndominiums can be both beautiful and energy efficient. Integrating eco-friendly solutions can save money and reduce your carbon footprint. Here are a few practices to consider:

- Solar panels on the roof to harness renewable energy.
- Energy-efficient windows and insulation to keep heating and cooling costs down.
- Water-saving fixtures in kitchens and bathrooms to promote sustainability.

### Choose a Balanced Color Palette

The right color scheme can greatly enhance the ambiance of your farmhouse barndominium. Here are some effective tips:

- Utilize neutral tones like tans, grays, and whites as a base to create a calm atmosphere.
- Add pops of color through artwork, furniture, or décor items that personalize the space.
- Consider earthy shades like greens and browns to reflect the beauty of the surrounding landscape.

With these creative farmhouse barndominium design ideas, you can create a space that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional. Emphasizing open spaces, blending styles, and focusing on sustainable practices will help you craft the perfect modern living environment while enjoying the rustic elements that define the farmhouse aesthetic.

</div>Tips for Blending Rustic Charm with Contemporary Features in Barndominium Renovations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Barndominiums have gained popularity for their unique blend of rustic charm and modern living amenities. Renovating a barndominium can provide the perfect opportunity to showcase this dichotomy. If you’re considering such a project, here are some valuable tips to seamlessly merge rustic elements with contemporary features.

### Embrace Open Spaces

One of the hallmarks of contemporary design is open floor plans. In a barndominium, this can create a spacious feel that complements rustic charm. Start by removing unnecessary walls to facilitate flow between living areas.

- **Large Windows:** Install oversized windows or sliding glass doors to invite natural light. This enhances the airy feel while providing breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape.
- **Multi-Functional Areas:** Designate areas for different activities without distinct boundaries. This can lead to a cozy but practical layout perfect for modern life.

### Choose the Right Materials

Textured materials can enhance both rustic and contemporary aesthetics. Consider the following:

- **Natural Wood:** Use reclaimed wood for beams, ceilings, or feature walls. Its warm tones contrast beautifully with sleek, modern finishes.
- **Metal Accents:** Incorporate metal elements like steel handrails or industrial-style light fixtures for an edgy look. It adds a contemporary twist without overshadowing the rustic base.
- **Stone Features:** A stone fireplace or an accent wall made of local stone can serve as a stunning focal point, marrying the rustic with the modern.

### Color Palettes Matter

Your color choices can bridge rustic and contemporary styles. Think about these color strategies:

- **Neutral Tones:** Use a base of soft whites, grays, and beiges for walls. These colors make spaces feel larger and more inviting.
- **Pops of Color:** Incorporate vibrant shades through décor or furniture that reflect contemporary trends, such as teal or mustard yellow. This allows for personalization while keeping a balanced feel.
- **Earthy Hues:** Dark greens, browns, and rusty reds can add depth and tie in the rustic aspect.

### Furniture Selection

The right furniture pieces can significantly impact the overall design. Here are some guidelines:

- **Modern Lines:** Opt for furniture with sleek lines and a minimalistic approach for a contemporary touch. Think sofas with clean designs and metal frames, which can bring sophistication.
- **Vintage Finds:** Blend in vintage or antique pieces, like a distressed wooden dining table or a classic barn door, to maintain rustic integrity.
- **Layered Textures:** Combine different materials—like leather, fabric, and wood—in furniture selections to create a rich yet cohesive atmosphere.

### Smart Lighting Solutions

Lighting plays a crucial role in defining the mood of your barndominium. Here’s how to marry rustic and contemporary lighting:

- **Hang Industrial Fixtures:** Use metal pendant lights or chandeliers with a modern design above dining tables or kitchen islands for an eye-catching focal point.
- **Warm Bulbs:** Select warm light bulbs to create a cozy ambience, which enhances the rustic feel.
- **Layered Lighting:** Combine ambient, task, and accent lighting to provide functionality while creating an inviting atmosphere.

### Incorporate Nature

Integrating natural elements can enhance the overall harmony of your renovation. Consider these ideas:

- **Plants and Greenery:** Use indoor plants to breathe life into your spaces. They can act as natural décor that adds to both rustic and contemporary themes.
- **Outdoor Spaces:** Creating outdoor living spaces, such as decks or patios, can enhance your home's connection to nature. Use modern furniture to keep it chic and stylish.
- **Vertical Gardens:** For a contemporary twist, consider vertical gardens that allow you to combine greenery with space-saving solutions.

By embracing these tips, you can skillfully blend rustic charm with contemporary features in your barndominium renovations. This thoughtful approach not only enhances the aesthetics of your home but also creates a comfortable, functional space that you will cherish for years to come.

### Conclusion

Embracing the unique blend of rustic charm and contemporary aesthetics can truly elevate your farmhouse barndominium experience. By incorporating creative design ideas, such as open floor plans, oversized windows, and rustic wood accents, you can craft a space that feels both modern and inviting. The key is to strike a balance that highlights the beauty of the traditional barn structure while introducing updated features that enhance functionality.

When renovating or designing your barndominium, consider the use of natural materials like reclaimed wood, metal accents, and vintage fixtures. These elements not only pay homage to the original farmhouse style but also create a warm and welcoming atmosphere. Mixing old with new, like pairing a sleek kitchen with a classic wood stove, can result in unique designs that reflect your personal style.

Don't forget about the importance of outdoor spaces. Integrating patios, decks, or gardens allows you to extend your living area and enjoy the beauty of nature right at your doorstep. Outdoor furniture that complements your interior theme can create a seamless transition between indoor comfort and the great outdoors.

Ultimately, whether you are building from scratch or renovating an existing structure, your farmhouse barndominium should resonate with your lifestyle. Let your creativity flourish and design a home that not only suits your needs but also tells your story. With thoughtful planning and a clear vision, your barndominium will be a perfect blend of the rustic past and the comforts of modern living, all while providing a cozy retreat for family and friends.",1,1760031787.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

My best friend from college got married in January and my other best friend from college was the MOH. For context, I haven’t seen either of them in a decade, but I used to set up monthly catch-up calls. The reason I haven’t seen either of them in 10 years is because I live 8000 miles away from them. My flight was over 15 hours each way and it was *very* expensive. I consider the bride to be one of my closest friends and I wanted to be there, but I won’t lie it took a toll financially to be able to do that. Anyway, that’s not the point. 

This wasn’t a destination wedding. The wedding was at a drab old city so I didn’t even get to do anything fun. Again, not the point but I wanted to paint the wider picture. I arrived at the city 2 days early to account for jet lag and flight delays. We had previously arranged to meet for a 20 minute coffee because, again, I had travelled a really long way to be there and I assumed they valued our friendship as much as I did. As you may have guessed, they flaked on all of them. And as I said, I would have been fine with a 20 minute coffee. Or a breakfast. I would even be happy to go to the rehearsal lunch (the wedding part was only the couple, the MOH and the BM but family and a couple of other friends attended the rehearsal lunch), but I wasn’t invited to attend. MOH and the bride even had a dinner together that I wasn’t supposed to know about (it became very clear by the way they tried to cover it up. As someone who had some master manipulator friends in the past, it was very obvious that they were trying to cover their asses). All of this was coupled with them sending me the same type of message within seconds of each other, again manipulation 101, so I know there were discussing the fact that I had travelled all that distance on my own and they probably knew that what they were doing was shitty. And honestly, if they were honest, I wouldn’t have been so mad about it, but they both kept flaking on things and I felt that they were just stringing me alone. On the wedding day, I didn’t say anything obviously, because that would have been shitty and I would have been the asshole in that scenario—I went, I cried, I smiled for photos, I danced for two hours straight and mingled with other friends from college—but I’ve really cooled off the friendship since then. I used to send a lot of messages and would set up the monthly calls, but I haven’t done any of that. Of course, friendship is a two-way street and they could have kept better touch themselves, but other than setting up a call 5 months after the wedding, where they didn’t bring up the wedding at all, which I thought was telling. It’s been radio silence since.

One good thing that came from this whole mess is that it made me appreciate my other friends so much more (I did call my best friend the night before the wedding and cried to her about how this situation made me value her friendship even more). I just felt so disrespected. I’m pretty chill, but I really can’t stand disrespect. All that talking behind my back and trying to handle me felt so shitty. They didn’t even bother to try to manipulate me in a smarter way! Anyway, I don’t think I am an asshole for cooling things off because, as I said, friendship is a two way street, but maybe I should have brought up how disappointed I was about the whole situation a couple of months after the event. what do you think?

I first grabbed it out of curiosity, hoping to manage the not-so-pleasant dog-and-couch combo that takes over my living room after rainy walks. To my surprise, it turned into a staple product that sits right next to the laundry detergent and fabric softener in my cabinet. Pacific Breeze & Coconut? Honestly, I wasn’t sure about the combination at first. Would it be overwhelmingly sweet or annoyingly tropical? Thankfully, it’s neither. The scent is fresh, clean, and hits a nice balance—not too overpowering, but just enough to make you constantly sniff the air after use.  

The first time I used this fabric spray, I grabbed a suspicious-looking pillow that everyone in my family avoids but refuses to throw out. A few spritzes later, and it was like holding a cloud of freshness. It covers a lot of surface area in one spray, so you don’t need to drench the fabric to feel the impact. Directions say to spray from 18-24 inches away, and I found that sticking to this distance ensures an even spread without making spots damp. My carpeted bedroom floors tend to trap odors too, so I gave them a quick spray. Guess what? No more lingering smells from spilled coffee or the mystery-food my toddler decided to sneak in last month.  

**Merits**  
- The Pacific Breeze & Coconut scent is well-balanced and brings a unique fragrance to household fabrics.  
- Works incredibly well across various surfaces, from upholstery and curtains to pet bedding and carpets.  
- The lightweight and ergonomic design of the spray bottle makes handling effortless.  
- An excellent boost for those in-between cleaning days when washing everything isn’t practical.  

[Check Clorox BB0705 price on Amazon.](https://go.senaar.com/p/b07tbbc178/)  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- As much as I enjoy the scent, I noticed it fades after a few hours, especially on larger areas like carpets.  
- This spray is listed as inappropriate for suede, leather, or silk fabrics, so its versatility isn’t limitless.  
- It takes a few minutes for the spray to completely dry, which might bother those in a rush.  

The performance-to-versatility ratio of this product is worth addressing here. While it covers a broad range of fabrics, I wished it ventured slightly into the untouchable categories like suede or delicate silks. But hey, no product is perfect, right? On the bright side, it has revived the dog couch corner in my house—the one that was so dismal, even our dog started sitting in other places.  

**Product Rivals**  
Fabric refreshers come in all shapes and scents these days. Against competitors like Febreze Fabric Refresher or Mrs. Meyers Room Spray, this product stands out for its fantastic aroma longevity—at least on smaller surfaces like pillows and bedding. Febreze hits the mark with odor elimination, but I find its scents a bit too generic compared to the unique blend of Pacific Breeze & Coconut. Mrs. Meyers, while great for a natural vibe, doesn’t carry quite the same strength in larger rooms or carpets. If you’re someone prioritizing scent uniqueness and all-around ease of use, this Clorox spray edges others out slightly, especially for people like me dealing with pet-related odors regularly. However, if durability across all fabric types is what you need, rivals like Febreze might be better suited.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Figuring out if a room spray fits the bill isn’t always about the initial cost but what it delivers long-term. This product truly transforms household fabrics with its vibrant scent and freshens areas that don’t get frequent washes. Considering the multi-surface usability, ease of application, and well-curated fragrance, it makes for a solid investment. It isn’t just a random spray you offer your furniture; it’s a refreshing little luxury. Plus, each bottle lasts quite a while even with regular use, so you’re really squeezing value out of every last drop. True, other brands may offer slightly cheaper options, but they often compromise on fragrance sophistication or scent longevity.

- Goodwood: Andrew Duhon. *There’s a mystical allure to the road. Both literal and figurative, it’s the blacktop and the connective tissue linking people, places, and cultures. For Andrew Duhon, it’s always been a path from the unknown toward possibility. He first packed into a Chevy Express van with scuffed amps, overflowing merch boxes, and a trio of musicians to share his songs with anyone willing to listen. For a young Duhon, the road bridged “No Man’s Land” to the “Promised Land,” connecting him with both the good ol’ boys in Beaumont, TX, and the artists in Bellingham, WA. But that journey isn’t weightless. Duhon writes songs that cost something to tell—honest, soul-baring stories that reach beyond entertainment. His music builds connection, healing, and recognition. His travels have offered a rare lens into the American landscape, and his songs reflect both his story and ours.* 7:30pm

1o2cdet,https://v.redd.it/qtjcdcc9g4uf1,Gratitude in Action: When Personal Practice Shapes Business Decisions,"This clip from our latest episode captures something beautiful about aligning values with business practices.

Laetitia Bouffard-Roupe starts every morning with gratitude journaling—writing three things she's grateful for before touching her phone. She also uses daily mantras for mindset and healing.

But here's what makes her approach powerful: it doesn't stay internal.

Host Dwight Spencer observes: ""I can see how your gratitude practice translates into the way that you bring others along. You're very conscious about all of the supply chains involved in producing your books.""

Laetitia's response: ""I print locally. My printer is 10 minutes away from my house.""

Think about what that means:

* She could print cheaper overseas
* She could prioritize convenience or profit margins
* She could treat printing as just another transaction

Instead, she chooses:

* Local community support
* Personal relationships (she knows her printer by name)
* Conscious awareness of her supply chain
* Alignment between morning practice and business decisions

Dwight references AJ Jacobs' ""Thanks a Thousand""—a book about all the people responsible for bringing you your cup of coffee. Laetitia embodies this awareness in her creative business.

This is what conscious creativity looks like in practice. When your values aren't just words—they're decisions. When gratitude isn't just a feeling—it's a business strategy.

Questions for discussion:

* How do your personal practices influence your professional decisions?
* What does ""conscious business"" mean to you?
* How can creatives balance values with practical business needs?
* What local businesses do you intentionally support?

I'm an (not) average 27 years old guy, who's kinda artistic, a huge horror (and paranormal) movie lover, addicted to music, professional TV show binge watcher, part time alcoholic, and a wannabe comedian. Into reading, long walks in the afterglow, drinking coffee while watching the sunrise, beaches, street lights in the middle of the night, the fuzzy blue-ish lights in dark bathrooms.
Looking for friends, and everything that comes with that.

Staying up all night and telling each other bad jokes, long talks about life, trying to solve together the mysteries of the blood, to find a way to return to the innocence, and definitely find the way out of the labyrinth of life. Looking for someone with whom we share our lives, someone who's gonna be there when everyone else leaves, someone who's gonna be the shoulder (and I'll be theirs) when we cry. Someone whom we can cheer ourselves up, have a laugh, joke around, dream, and someone who's gonna be there.

I have no issues attending solo, but these sort of things are much funner with other people/groups!

34M, super chill laid back dude here. Work in creative (design/advertising/web dev). Actually a Miami-native; born, raised and lived there my whole life but moved away to the Pacific Northwest about 6 years ago.

I'm just an overall music-lover. I attend shows and festivals pretty regularly. Been to about 8 shows in the past month alone. Music-wise; I lean groovy/psychadelic/funk/dance/lofi/hip-hop but am open to all genres. 

Some of the artists im most excited to wee this year are Oden & Fatzo, Thundercat, Sean Paul, ANOTR, Barry Cant Swim, Denzel Curry, Peggy Gou, Chase & Status, Riordan, Black Coffee, Mau P, Dom Dolla,And honestly pretty excited to discover a whole bunch of new artists. 

Also, as I got that Miami-blood, your boy can definitely rally, so def open to hitting up the afters (and the after-afters) as well. Will be staying with family in the North Miami area and will be ubering in and out of the fest. Flying in on the 13th and will be there til the 20th, so def open to hanging before and after the fest too. 

Hope to hear from y'all!

With its compatibility as a replacement for GE models like FQK2J and FQK1K, this product stood out to me as a practical solution for an under sink filtration system. While I was satisfied with its overall performance, there are some aspects worth noting before making a final judgement. Let’s dive into the nitty-gritty!

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed was the sleek, compact design of this water filter. At 2.32 inches in diameter and standing 10.16 inches tall, it fits snugly under the sink without hogging too much space. Thanks to its use of coconut carbon and food-grade plastic, it not only feels durable but also keeps BPA and lead far away from my drinking water. One time when my nephew spilled juice near the installation area, the filter didn’t show any signs of bursting or malfunctioning. That’s a win in my book for robust engineering!

**Filter Efficiency**  
One of the highlights of this system is its impressive filtration capability. It reduces chlorine, heavy metals, sediment, and even unpleasant odors and tastes quite effectively. I tested the filtered water side-by-side with unfiltered tap water, and you could taste the distinct difference. The AQUA CREST WF27-2J churns out crisp water that makes my morning coffee taste much better. However, it doesn’t reduce Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), which some might consider a limitation for a water filter in this price range.  

[Check AQUA CREST WF27-2J price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b01g3tbgh2/)

**Installation and Fit**  
The installation process with this model couldn’t have been simpler, and I mean that sincerely. It took me less than 10 minutes to swap out my old filter for this one. The fit was perfect, thanks to AQUA CREST’s precise manufacturing. There were no leaks during my testing—even when I tightened everything myself without calling a handyman. This level of user-friendliness makes it ideal for those of us who aren’t plumbing wizards. However, remember that this filter connects only to the cold water valve, which might not suit everyone’s needs.

**Performance Longevity**  
This water filter boasts a lifespan of about six months or 1,320 gallons, depending on usage. Although I’ve only been using it for four months, the water quality hasn’t declined a bit so far. As someone who drinks a ton of water daily, this longevity feels just right for the average household. I’d probably recommend setting a reminder on your phone so you replace it before it hits its expiration point—not that I’m speaking from experience, of course.

**Key Benefits**  
Here are some standout features I appreciated:  
- Exceptionally efficient filtration system, removing unpleasant tastes and odors effectively.  
- Straightforward and leak-free installation process that even beginners can tackle.  
- BPA-free and lead-free materials ensure safety in every drop of water I use.  

**Limitations**  
While the product impressed me overall, there are a few areas where it could improve:  
- It doesn’t reduce Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), which some might expect in a water filtration system.  
- The filter is designed for cold water use only, which might limit its versatility.  

**Alternative Products**  
If you’re considering other options, products like Brita’s under sink filters or even GE-branded systems might come to mind as competitors. While the AQUA CREST WF27-2J holds its ground with features like its food-grade housing and efficient filtration, some alternatives might focus on additional metrics like reducing TDS or integrating a more advanced filtration process. Brita, for instance, tends to specialize more on taste enhancement, while GE often leans into premium, high-end filter systems. This model offers a middle ground, catering nicely to those who prioritize affordability without sacrificing core performance.

**Smart Spending**  
In terms of cost-effectiveness, this filter provides immense value for its price point. Given its impressive filtration capabilities and ease of installation, it’s an investment in better-tasting, safer water for everyday use. For those of us who don’t want to break the bank replacing filters frequently or installing complex systems, this one checks quite a few boxes. While it may not rival ultra-premium alternatives in certain technical aspects, its performance diminishes any feeling of buyer’s remorse.

A few weeks ago I started a much more active life both physically as well as mentally and I was wondering what you would recommend for my situation.

I'm basically looking for the least interference caused by ingestion during most of the day (say the first 12 hours) as I'm either doing something   
physical: running, swimming, ball sports, dancing, gymnastics, hypertrophy training   
or mentally taxing: studying, focusing during lectures, organising events 

Both categories happen anywhere those first 12h, depending on the day and I cycle everywhere (which amounts to at least 30 minutes daily)



I want:  
\- to have lots of sustained energy during sports and workouts  
\- to be able to fully focus and not rest&digest during lectures or while studying  
\- hypertrophy support  
\- keep eating clean & healthy



Right now I'm doing:  
\- big dinners with lots of carbs and enough protein. Fats are not neglected  
\- fruits and nuts during the day (not constantly snacking, just 2-3 times, between courses and after sports)  
\- skipping breakfast unless I'm doing physical activity in the morning



I want to know:  
\- should I switch to fruit carbs only during the day to sustain energy  
\- or should I actually eat a bit more, 'real meals' (ie more fiber, protein and maybe fats) in those moments. just small enough to not interfere with activities  
\- or if I should give intermittent fasting a try instead  
\- which foods you recommend in either of these cases



notes/thoughts:  
\- I drink enough water  
\- I've been thinking about a plant based diet, as I really haven't felt like eating meat/fish the last weeks. Will likely try this somewhere in the near future.  
\- I don't drink coffee, should I?  
\- I take prescribed ritalin daily",1,1760030965.0,workout,1,0.67,False

Im looking to write a Tomarry fic and wanted some constructive criticism and to see if anyone would be interested in reading my work. 

Tom needed to be the perfect student, to get perfect grades on every test, charm his professors and carry out his prefect duties without fault. He'd always had high ambitions, dreaming at Wools of how he'd change the world, but he knew that as a halfblood he'd have to work 10 times harder to get where he wanted. Abraxas Malfoy merely needed to ask his father or his endless connections and he'd have everything he pleased, a satchel made out of drangonleather hide, the latest broom, a conversation with the Minister of Magic, it  could all be easily bought. For Tom he had to scrimp and save, stretching magic to the limit to rewear clothes that he should have disposed of years ago. He didn't have the connections his classmates did and magic society wasn't one that a person could advance through based merely on skill. 

As he sat there pouring over a muggle studies essay at the point of exhaustion, everyone having gone to sleep hours before, he resented it. Resented the many sleepless nights spent working while his classmates had parties and balls, making connections he longed to have. He resented the feeling of his body falling apart for lack of food. As he drank the bitter taste of coffee, having run out of his rationed allowance of tea, he wished above all things, for an easy way out. Alas. there was not one. Asking his Knights for endless favours would make them feel he owed them something, and he knew all too well being in others debt came at a high price. ",3,1760030871.0,tomarry,0,1.0,False

He felt perpetually tired, struggled with focus at work, and noticed a dip in his overall vitality. Sound familiar? John isn't alone. Many men experience similar challenges, often attributing them to age or stress. But what if a few simple, evidence-backed changes to your morning could make a significant difference?*

This article delves into how adopting specific morning routines, supported by medical research, can profoundly enhance male health across several key areas: physical energy, cognitive function, and sexual performance.

**Keywords:** Male health, morning routine, sexual health, cognitive function, physical energy

# The Science of a Powerful Morning

The science is clear: a structured morning routine can profoundly influence male physiological and psychological performance. The morning hours are crucial for setting the body's internal clock and optimizing various biological processes.

**1. Optimize Your Sleep and Wake Time** It all starts the night before. Prioritizing 7-9 hours of quality sleep is foundational for improved concentration, mood, and immunity throughout the day, as emphasized by institutions like the [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/). Waking up at a consistent time, aligned with your chronotype (your natural sleep-wake preference), enhances energy levels by synchronizing with your body’s natural cortisol rise.

**2. Embrace Morning Sunlight Exposure** Exposure to natural light early in the day helps regulate your circadian rhythm and promotes wakefulness. Research indicates that 5-30 minutes of natural light exposure within the first hour of waking can suppress melatonin, increasing circulating cortisol and potentially boosting testosterone production, which can improve sexual function in men with low libido ([newtraderu.com](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFtJmx9OUFpsj3vToYPsFd0VaHMwInbJe0E6Hf5x33eIWrW3LBxz-8WhAls4x1LFMsiJWcok1xeztu0T0p5N3dOEIz7N092TQKHXZxbLm98nHACsyatW2qY53-htBOjo8aoQUcHIAr17eP4DOu3H6Ugs3H8KM6Fy1PPlVaxSCg4CctTvFUFin_SncewC41cUPq7Pt5Nzla0lWeYRoTlQ==)).

**3. Hydrate Immediately** After an overnight fast, your body needs to rehydrate. A full glass of water upon waking jumpstarts metabolism, aids digestion, and can prevent fatigue while boosting short-term memory and attention ([healthline.com](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFBifSmno1bVcn9L_9Z_mij_yNCnijcBUx38-XgLzCWCqzagMrmKZDCXNaknbVx_8X922YmTdsi_Dbm5e0Yx7e6RF_VqiJydfbXM7jQEQ3xyQH3wv8YPKCLHHtXu2LCnm4FePKhzIzTLipO13aJcLfM2R0X8RkO28185MOBMs1Fi50)).

**4. Incorporate Morning Movement** Even a short burst of physical activity can be transformative. Morning exercise, from stretching to high-intensity interval training (HIIT), can increase energy levels, boost metabolism, improve muscle strength, and enhance cardiovascular health. For men, morning HIIT has been shown to significantly increase testosterone levels and improve physical capacity. Consistent physical activity also reduces the likelihood of erectile dysfunction (ED) ([nih.gov](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHYQmbErjRW3X1euaW8xWAxf-8xomcL2PlB3lhijYVfhPX_h8nXZt8y_BTAb3f-TpO5ZhbKMOiZkP4BYommxF1baTluITuZJQ2gCTTpkJfbjpxZv3qSEFIjcvYOY69XeFim-U2Y4r7yU2w8)). While some studies suggest evening exercise might offer distinct cardiometabolic benefits for men, overall health gains from regular morning activity are substantial ([frontiersin.org](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGU1nsS1cdRPLz9Rs254hOqWg75PdNhq_6o-Q4KrADQ9AWvYqv4hEBSysIs2WKYmrFE6GCvfd8dniLvGGcJW5RDkwJ_uajzkCUXtZIlt_zoLbPo2kx6WzKBKVLgPSZPyZaN2tmftgC_PyMQf-DkKk0uAsYe3kGRv40vjbonfKP4BBW6A77XjNs9iEyxCjnFE4aV)).

**5. Fuel Your Body with a Nutritious Breakfast** A balanced breakfast with protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats provides sustained energy and stabilizes blood sugar, which is crucial for optimal brain function and concentration ([rogersfoods.com](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHWFR7c8gPXUeGDQ2fPKmTVK1TF4m4_DE3-Xou35LFWaMIBzmYQz4bTpgAhEDQjeGqeYSYh48MtOIIMAB8aN4e5iFIEUEq1wbG61c7g3Wi2isI2X27uRj7OeLIP5tlw7E-U-5b6kzQEEdoV2gmUiqfzPQ3eV8-oZqvYVbZxPHIWsICso3jdNWbOSAjud3A-Zk9uBNna)). Skipping breakfast can negatively impact cognitive function.

**6. Practice Mindfulness or Meditation** Dedicating a few minutes to mindfulness, meditation, or gratitude can reduce stress and anxiety, improve mood, and enhance self-awareness and attention span. This sets a calm and balanced tone for the day, contributing to healthier sleep patterns and better overall well-being ([apa.org](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQED2Hqcti5xfi8aIqc4CLbomhP9Q7ea5wIoGmfhAUuOoW_JoM1M0UXPA0T2Hkkc18hC2DyY0Xsd4k-nHDPiduM80o6ZCS7TZdESV0s84g8Sv0VZqDLeatjjpogWO488n5jhw2-nddX9aJyhOg==)).

**7. Strengthen Your Pelvic Floor** Incorporating Kegel exercises into your daily routine can strengthen pelvic floor muscles, which are vital for bladder control and can improve sexual performance by enhancing blood flow regulation to the penis ([mayoclinic.org](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHsbx6RSehhkoctjhI-Pjvk2am7FbXPfncPASHGTNm17AfNSGH11Pt127GipDcnqiXItBLMTHGRS7SstwPzXCb407x180ITvhN16UwsdIAuFWQ6NtMmvRHBNCQtYQ6vfsYOwPZB3PxC_Ln9PBbshWHl2tQhzwQOyFcG0rZEiBSdh9NuU9y39XvSA9PJuWOz4Qkff8pGb3R7DOq7XDvFshjlB)).

# Actionable Advice for Your Morning

* **Start Small:** Don't try to implement all habits at once. Choose one or two to begin with, like consistent wake-up times and morning hydration, and gradually add more. Consistency is key for lasting change.
* **Prioritize Sleep Environment:** Ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, calm, and cool (60-75°F or 15-24°C). Avoid screens at least an hour before bed.
* **Sunlight Ritual:** Step outside for 10-15 minutes soon after waking, without sunglasses if possible. If outdoor light isn't feasible, consider a bright light therapy lamp.
* **Hydrate Smart:** Keep a glass of water by your bedside to drink immediately upon waking. Consider adding a squeeze of lemon for flavor and vitamin C.
* **Move Your Body:** Dedicate 15-30 minutes to movement. This could be a brisk walk, a quick bodyweight circuit, or some gentle yoga. Prepare your workout clothes the night before to reduce friction.
* **Mindful Moments:** Spend 5-10 minutes meditating, journaling, or simply focusing on your breath to cultivate calmness before the day's demands begin.
* **Balanced Breakfast:** Opt for a breakfast rich in protein (eggs, Greek yogurt), complex carbs (oatmeal, whole-grain toast), and healthy fats (avocado, nuts) to sustain energy and focus.
* **Kegel Routine:** Integrate pelvic floor exercises into an existing habit, like brushing your teeth. Perform 4 sets of 10 repetitions daily.

1o2c222,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o2c222,AIO at Wife and Ex-Manager’s interactions?,"Ok, cringe time. My (54yr, two kids under 10 with Jan) wife Jan (42yr) left an organisation about a year ago, smallish community, everyone involved lives close by. She has kept close ties to her previous employers, recently delivering a speech lauding the departing boss of the whole operation, let’s call him Don (mid 50s married, grown up kids).I’ve only met Don once, a few months ago. He walked into a town establishment my wife and I and other people were shopping in and proceeded to throw his arms open and give her a big hug. I was taken aback so stood in the background observing this, I’m a little rough around the edges looking sometimes, and I’m guessing most people wouldn’t match me up with Jan, who is very well turned out and extremely pretty. She turned to me and introduced us and I immediately saw a change in his demeanour, eyes widening, tightening up his body language etc. I have a background in policing and have an unnaturally good sense of people. Didn’t like him.

Sometime ago Don had facebook friended my wife, surprising but not outrageous, because of their professional relationship he was able to contact her in other ways too. I was aware that they’d messaged online a little bit, this was not a concern to me at all, my wife is widely known and respected, so is often in conversation online with many people.

Don recently accepted a job elsewhere and in appreciation of his good work in our community Jan took it upon herself to make a little speech as a guest at the last official meeting of the org he was to attend. It was very well received and as she is finishing her masters degree in Public Administration she got to brush up on her public speaking.

Now - I tend to stay home and watch the kids, I am a stay at home dad. Jan is very often out, volunteering at local events or just attending as support. She has mentioned “bumping into” Don several times lately, again fine, they are involved in a lot of the same things indirectly or directly despite no longer working together.
Last week she went out to telework from a local coffee bar, something she does only very occasionally. She returned a lot later than I’d thought she would, explaining that she’d “bumped into” Don and he’d bought her lunch. She was acting quite strangely, giving me way too much detail of their conversation, and also how she’d randomly seen a different colleague whilst out too. I could clearly tell she was lying and straight up told her, and that it sounded like this was an arranged meeting. The fact she’d lie about something like that was concerning, she’s very open and honest and an absolutely terrible liar. She swore up and down her story was true. Swore on her life.
The cell phone bill said otherwise. I then asked her if she had these texts and if she’d deleted any, as there was a string of SMS charges on our bill. Again, swearing, saying she was sorry she lied and that I “probably won’t believe her about anything now” because she’d lied before. Again, she was lying. She showed me the days texts on her phone and there were only two. She gave me reasons why, saying she knew I didn’t like Don etc. and that there was nothing else in the deleted conversations that was anything but “silly” stuff. I offered to try to retrieve the messages, and she said I could. They’d been very permanently deleted. I told her this and she replied she has no idea how to even do that. She lied again, as one of the screenshots shows from her browser history. Which throws up other concerns too. 

While their messages are fairly brief I’d like you to pay careful attention and read between the lines. Remember, this is the main boss, not a close friend, although he has taken to referring to her in those general terms, along with hugging her apparently, which she admits he did in the way in and the way out of their lunch date. The red flags from where I’m sitting are the odd use of the heart emoji, mentioning his new apartment (miles from home and wife) then immediately confirming that Jan is working nearish to that new apartment. The asking for consent to be texting her, even though they were already on messenger, and the way he dived from messenger to SMS within minutes of getting her cell. There’s nothing overt, apart from his very last message, which confirms my suspicions of the way he has been acting toward my wife and his ultimate intentions. That message is not only a huge flag, but also seems to be him asking permission to continue. I don’t even want to talk about Jan’s cringe reply, she has the ‘tism somewhat and had to google what to say, screenshot included, I’m quite horrified at what she chose, but I digress. Jan is now in pieces over her lies and I feel pretty bad about it too, I’ve lost trust in someone I love more than life itself over something she could have just spoken to me about, like we normally would. I’d really like some opinions on these messages, if anyone has the time, some outside perspective would be fantastic. Thanks guys.

I didn’t really have a choice. It was either interview with a massive coffee stain on my jacket or just rock the shirt and tie. Some of my Friends who went to med school told me Its not a big deal at all but I was the only one not wearing a blazer/jacket besides a few of the female interviewees and just one of the guys 😭😭😭. I guess that none of my interviewers or admissions staff were wearing a suit jacket though so maybe it’s not a big deal? 

I already had major impostor syndrome about  the interview and this didn’t help. Did this actually fuck up my chances?

Both interviews went incredibly well though. Both the student and faculty commended me at multiple points and even said something to the effect of “when you’re on campus next year”. no one mentioned my outfit or anything. ",0,1760030500.0,premed,9,0.5,False
1o2c0yy,https://www.reddit.com/r/kristinjohnssnark/comments/1o2c0yy/my_country_is_burning_but_i_couldnt_care_less/,"My country is burning but I couldn't care less, ""here are my Prime Big Days deals guys! $$$<3""","So I've been thinking of posting something regarding influencers like Kristin and her friend group (John, Sazan and co) and family, in particular her sister Ashlyn but also her SIL Alexys. I know all these people are extremely conservative and evangelical christians (except her sister). Kristin doesn't show it as much as Sazan or John for example but I think out of fear of losing following and therefore money. But when you buy real estate or start businesses with people with these ideas (supporting a genocide, against women's bodily autonomy, glorifying a dumb divisive far right nationalist and white supremacist christian influencer as a martyr, and I could go on and on), you basically share the same ideas. I can't even understand how someone could stand being in the same room as Sazan for more than 20 seconds. I don't think I've ever heard someone so obnoxious in my life and that's telling for someone who has lived in 8 different countries across different continents (lol should I have posted this in Sazan snark? Maybe...).

Anyways, sorry for the jumbled thoughts but with the current fascist turn the US administration is turning the country into (this is literally Fascism 101, it only suffices to open a book or even just ask chatgpt if you can't be bothered, they'll tell you!), I can't wrap my head around how tone deaf and I will say, inhumane these influencers are, caring more about selling products and sharing stupid ads and Prime deals but to be concerned and alert on the state of their country. I believe this is no longer a partisan issue. Whether you are traditionally Republican or Democrat, people on both sides recognize that MAGA has completely hijacked the Republican party and now all elected Republican in Congress (with the exception of a few timidly standing up, out of genuine concern or hypocritical electoral fear of failing to be re-elected) are complicit in the rapid fall of democracy in the US. The daily news are so wild and barely believable (that was Project 2025's intention and it's working) that we tend to forget all the crazy shit that this convicted President and his administration have done and are doing on a daily basis and the daily lies they are spewing every single day, with complete disregard to the American people whom they do not give a single damn about. 

Anyways, I know it probably comes down to how uneducated these influencers are at the end of the day, but I don't even like to narrow it down to that because I know a lot of people with no higher education degree that actually care more about other human beings and living in a democratic society  than their growing asset portfolio or their commission account on Amazon. At the end of the day, these influencers (Kristin Johns and co) are so disconnected to reality (multi-millionaires in their 20s, multi-residence owners, buying 7K coffee machines), and literal airheads (never share anything interesting, even a book or a movie) god forbid dare raising awareness on any kind of social or political issue (I guess idolizing a convicted billionaire acting as President or a white supremacist nationalist christian influencer is more christian than being a social justice advocate in their eyes?!) that I wonder why they're still relatable/interesting to so many people. Maybe (most likely) they aren't but people stay for the pseudo entertainment of living proxy lives... or the snark.

I believe that without being a political influencer, given the current political climate and the platforms these people have, staying silent in the face of the illegal actions of this administration is complicit and so disgusting. Not saying anything means that they approve these masked ICE agents arresting people arbitrarily on the basis of their skin color and destroying families (how christian!), the Administration sending the actual National guard (army!) to major US cities (with the lowest crime rates!) to attack innocent individuals, the President and his administration trying to hide his very well documented relationship to Epstein in the files (which he campaigned on but now is scared to see released), etc, etc. No member of this government is fit for their jobs and that's why the country is rapidly going down. 

How is this American ? I guess it is in the sense that these people are literal incarnation of late stage capitalism consumerist puppets. They live to consume. It's absolutely abhorrent. These people are the furthest thing I know from loving christians and I'm glad the world is starting to see how hypocritical they are. 

I guess it's just a ranting post but I wonder how you guys feel about that?",0,1760030489.0,kristinjohnssnark,7,0.42,False
1o2c0u2,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1o2c0u2/seeking_advice_about_opening_a_bookstore_in_sf/,Seeking Advice About Opening a Bookstore in SF Bay Area,"tl;dr - I'm exploring the possibility of opening a bookstore and seeking broad and general advice from small business owners, or anyone with an opinion on the matter really.

Last February, I was let go from a staff senior copywriter job at an ad agency. I'm currently working freelance and exploring possibilities for the future. 

One of the biggest factors that led to my being let go is the rise of AI, which will only continue to complicate career prospects for staff copywriters. 

Some brief background - I'm 35, and have been a copywriter for 10 years. Not only does that experience feel less valuable now than it was a decade ago, but I'm looking forward to using this opportunity to transition into something I'll ultimately find more enjoyable than advertising (and which will ideally be more AI proof).

I love reading and writing, and I'd ultimately like to write fiction. Right now, the two most idealistic career paths I could see would be teaching or owning a bookstore. On a surface level, I find the prospect of owning a bookstore to be the most appealing. 

I'd be looking to open a small shop in San Francisco or Marin (where I live), and would hope to ultimately expand beyond just bookselling (coffee, community and author events, etc.) 

If I were to do this, I wouldn't imagine it happening for 10 years at the earliest. I'd start by talking to some bookstore owners in the area to learn about their experiences, and would likely look at getting a job in a local shop to learn the ropes. Considering that I have zero business experience whatsoever, there would be a ton to learn, and right now I'm just looking to collect some broad and general insight and advice from anyone who's opened a similar business. Does this sound like a worthwhile pursuit? A profitable one? Like a great idea, or a terrible idea (based on the little you know about my situation from what's above)?

Ended up having a big session after work, usually a few beers followed by many many doubles of Bourbon which has been a nightly thing for at least the past year and a half. Been a drinker since I was around 15, now 33.

And just after that waking up, I didn't feel like it anymore? I knew it just wasn't worth it? I can count on one hand the amount of times I have been sober for more than 1 day in the past five years. 

One thing that i noticed just waking up this morning.. that was probably the single best sleep that I have had in the last five years. Actually waking up feeling amazingly well rested, and having energy again. Immediately made myself a coffee and started cleaning, and actually looking forward to having this energy for the rest of the day.

The kitchen transformed from organized chaos into barely controlled catastrophe. Orders flew from the service window. ""Two stews, one medium fowl, three house specials!"" Pans clattered, flames roared, and cooks cursed in three languages when orders backed up.

Through it all, Caleb's knife never stopped. His world had narrowed to the block, the blade, and the endless stream of vegetables that materialized whenever he finished a batch. He existed in a bubble of concentration, peripherally aware that others would occasionally haul off his prepped ingredients, but lost in the meditative rhythm of the work.

The kitchen door burst open with enough force to rattle the hanging pots. A figure swept in carrying a wooden tray loaded with tall glasses filled with what looked like sunshine given liquid form. The amber juice caught the light, promising sweet relief from the oppressive heat.

""Juice maiden to the rescue!"" one of the line cooks called out, his sweat-strained face cracking into the first genuine smile Caleb had seen in hours.

Corinne Hearthsong moved through the kitchen like a dancer weaving through a battlefield. She knew every station, every cook's rhythm, slipping between them with practiced ease. Her chestnut ponytail bounced with each step, and despite the chaos, her smile never dimmed.

""Cecil, you're dripping into the soup,"" she said, pressing a glass into the garde manger's grateful hands. ""Nina, take a break before you faint."" Another glass delivered with a gentle touch to the saucier's shoulder.

The kitchen's frantic energy shifted. Shoulders loosened, curse words became laughter, and for a moment, the impossible dinner rush seemed manageable. Corinne wasn't just delivering drinks—she was distributing hope.

She reached the center of the storm where Gareth worked with mechanical fury, plating three dishes simultaneously while barking corrections at anyone within earshot. The moment she approached, something remarkable happened.

The storm went still.

Gareth's hands paused mid-garnish. His shoulders, locked in perpetual strain, dropped a fraction. He turned from his station—something Caleb hadn't seen him do once in three hours—and looked at his daughter. 

""Hi, Papa,"" Corinne said, offering a glass.

The change was subtle. The hard lines around Gareth's mouth softened. He took the glass, and for the first time since Caleb had entered the kitchen, the half-elf smiled. Not a smirk or a grimace, but an open expression of warmth that made him look ten years younger.

He drained the juice in one long pull, his eyes closing briefly in appreciation. Then he did something that made Caleb's chest constrict with sudden, aching longing. Gareth leaned down and pressed a kiss to the top of Corinne's head.

""Thank you, sweetie.""

Two words. Soft, sincere, and completely at odds with the tyrant who'd terrorized the kitchen all evening. Corinne beamed, the expression so bright it could have powered the rune-lights overhead. She squeezed her father's arm and moved on, leaving Gareth to return to his plates with renewed energy.

She made her way to Caleb's corner, her eyes widening as she took in the progress at his workspace. Where hours ago had been piles of raw vegetables, now stood neat arrays of prepped ingredients, sorted by type and cut.

""Spirits,"" she breathed, then louder, ""You're already through the whole onion sack?""

Caleb paused, wiping sweat from his brow with the back of his hand. His throat was raw from the combination of onion vapor and kitchen heat. ""And the carrots. And the potatoes."" He gestured to his latest project. ""Working on the third type of mushrooms now.""

Her jaw dropped, the expression so cartoonishly amazed that despite his exhaustion, Caleb felt his lips twitch toward a smile.

""That's... that's incredible! Usually, it takes new prep cooks a day just to get through half that much without crying into the stew."" Her face lit up with pure, unadulterated excitement. Not for herself, but for him. For his success. ""Papa must be impressed. He hasn't thrown anything at you has he?""

She pressed a glass into his hands. The juice was cold, sweet, with a tartness that cut through the film of grease and exhaustion coating his throat. It tasted like a blend of apple and pineapple juice, and he had to resist the urge to moan in appreciation.

""Pace yourself,"" she advised, already moving toward the dishwashers, who looked ready to collapse. ""We've got another two hours at least!""

As she distributed the last of her glasses, dancing between the chaos with effortless grace, a thought formed in Caleb's mind. He watched the way exhausted faces lit up at her approach, how the entire kitchen's rhythm shifted around her presence. Cassia was the brains of this operation—he'd seen that in how she'd handled him, evaluated his potential, and made the decision to offer him a chance. Gareth was obviously the muscle, the driving force that converted raw ingredients into culinary art through sheer will and decades of skill.

But Corinne was the heart.

She was the one who remembered that the people working these rough hours were human (or elf, or dwarf). She brought not only material relief but emotional sustenance. In his old life, Caleb had worked for companies that had million-dollar engagement programs trying to achieve what this sixteen-year-old did with fruit juice and earnest care.

The thought brought a sharp twinge, a fishhook of stabbing recollection. Katie would have been like this, given a few more years. She had the instinct to care for others, to notice when someone was struggling. On days he brought his work home, she'd slip into his study with a mug of coffee, unprompted, or text him some ridiculous meme that always made him laugh—

He slammed the knife down harder than necessary, using the impact to derail that train of thought. Not now. Not here. The grief was a luxury he couldn't afford in the middle of this trial by fire.

The mushrooms needed slicing. That was real, immediate, solvable. He could mourn more later.

The dinner rush continued its assault. Slips from the service window multiplied in an endless stream. Caleb's awareness shrank back to his block, but the juice had revived him, given him a second wind. His knife moved with renewed precision, and he found himself anticipating needs—preparing extra onions when he heard ""four stew orders all day,"" shifting to thin-sliced vegetables when the wok station got slammed.

Time lost meaning. Minutes felt like hours, hours like minutes. His back screamed, his feet went numb, and his hands developed a tremor that had nothing to do with his body's age and everything to do with repetitive motion and hunger. But beneath the exhaustion, a new feeling stirred. It was a simple, sharp satisfaction he couldn't quite place.

In his corporate life, his wins had been abstract things. Successfully implementing a new database system. Increasing operational efficiency by twelve percent. Numbers on screens, handshakes in conference rooms, accomplishments that evaporated the moment he left the office.

This was different. This was primal. He took raw materials and made them into something useful. Every dice, every slice, every perfectly quartered potato was a small victory, a tangible proof of his contribution. When a cook grabbed one of his prep piles and nodded appreciatively, that meant more than email ever had.

Finally—*finally*—the orders slowed. The noise level dropped from a roar to a murmur. Cooks began breaking down their stations, and the dishwashers attacked the mountain of pans with weary determination. One by one, the kitchen staff finished their cleaning and slipped out the back door, heading for drinks, bed, or both.

Caleb remained at his block. His knife moved on autopilot now, working through the prep for tomorrow's breakfast service. He'd stopped counting how many vegetables he'd processed. Thousands, certainly. His back was soaked through with sweat, his borrowed clothes clinging to skin that smelled of onions, herbs, and honest labor.

The kitchen grew quiet. The only sounds were the crackle of the banked fire in the hearth, the periodic drip of a faucet, and the soft slice of his blade through vegetables. Steam rose lazily from the few pots still simmering, creating ghost shapes in the air.

He'd done it. Somehow, impossibly, he'd survived.

Footsteps sounded on the stone floor. Measured, deliberate steps that could only belong to one person. Caleb didn't look up, couldn't look up. His entire focus remained on the knife, on finishing this last task perfectly. But he tracked Gareth's approach through sound, through the way the air pressure changed when the large man drew near.

The footsteps stopped. A presence loomed at his shoulder, and Caleb's hands stilled, tense under the portent of the moment.

Two bowls appeared in his peripheral vision, set down with practiced care. Steam rose from them in aromatic spirals, carrying scents that aroused the ravenous beast his hunger had become. Herbs he could identify—rosemary, thyme, something almost like bay leaf but sharper. Rich, dark meat, slow-cooked until it fell apart. Root vegetables molded by heat and time into something incredible.

""Sit,"" Gareth commanded.

Caleb's legs folded without conscious thought, exhaustion almost overcoming him. He caught himself on the block's edge, then straightened, trying to project strength he didn't feel.

A spoon appeared in the bowl. Gareth had already taken his seat on the opposite stool, his own bowl steaming between massive hands. The half-elf didn't speak, didn't gesture, but the message was clear: *Eat.*

Finding his own stool, Caleb lifted the spoon with fingers that trembled from more than fatigue. The first taste exploded across his palate with an intensity that made his eyes water for reasons that had nothing to do with onions. It wasn't just food—it was alchemy, art, magic without mana. The broth coated his tongue with layers of flavor that revealed themselves in sequence: the initial hit of perfectly balanced salt, then the deep umami of long-simmered bones, then herbs that combined the taste of a kitchen garden with something wilder, and finally a heat that built slowly, warming from the inside out.

The meat dissolved at the slightest pressure, so tender it seemed to melt. The vegetables had maintained their integrity while absorbing the stew's essence, each bite a splendid little packet of flavor. He'd eaten at five-star restaurants with Evelynn, trying to impress clients, and nothing—*nothing*—had come close to this.

This wasn't just food. It felt like a reward, something earned with sweat and stubbornness. He wanted to believe it was acceptance in a bowl. Maybe this was Gareth Hearthsong's way of saying what his taciturn nature would not allow. A simple acknowledgment. You'll do.

They ate in silence. Caleb forced himself to go slow, to savor each spoonful despite his body's demand to inhale the whole bowl. Across from him, Gareth ate with the mechanical efficiency he brought to everything, but Caleb caught him watching, evaluating, measuring.

The bowl emptied too soon. Caleb set his spoon down with careful precision, then straightened his spine and met Gareth's stare. Whatever happened next, he'd face it head-on.

Gareth finished his own bowl and set it aside. For a long moment, he said nothing, just studied Caleb with those deep green eyes that missed nothing. Then, finally, he spoke.

""Not bad.""

That was it. But from Gareth Hearthsong, those words felt like a royal commendation. Caleb had to bite back an absurd urge to laugh. Or cry. Or both.

The half-elf stood, gathering both bowls. He moved toward the wash station, set down the bowls, then paused at the door. Without turning around, he delivered his verdict in that gravelly tone:

""Here at dawn.""

The door swung shut with a quiet finality, leaving Caleb alone in the vast kitchen. Rune-lights dimmed to their nighttime settings, casting shadows between the prep stations. The block where he'd spent hours—*crumb, had it really only been one evening*—bore the scars of his work, knife marks crossing older wounds in the wood like a map of dedication.

*Here at dawn.*

Not a request. Not even really an order. It was simpler than that: an acknowledgment that tomorrow would happen, and when it did, Caleb would be here. He'd found something in this kitchen tonight. Not just employment, not just shelter, but something harder to define. Purpose, maybe. Or at least the promise of it.

He pushed himself to his feet, muscles protesting every movement. His body might be sixteen, but it had just worked harder than his forty-year-old self ever had. Tomorrow would hurt. But tomorrow he'd be here, knife in hand, ready to transform raw ingredients into something useful.

The stew's warmth spread through his chest as he made his way to the door. Behind him, the kitchen had settled into its nighttime quiet, but he could already imagine tomorrow's chaos. The orders, the heat, the impossible rush of keeping up with Gareth's demands.

He paused at the threshold, looking back at his station. His knife lay cleaned and ready, the block wiped down, everything prepared for dawn. It looked right. It looked like somewhere he belonged.

The thought should have been comforting. Instead, it brought a fresh wave of that complicated grief. Because belonging here meant accepting that his old life was gone. It meant letting go of the idea that this was temporary, that somehow he'd wake up in his own bed with Evelynn beside him.

""Here at dawn,"" he whispered to the empty kitchen, tasting the words. They felt like a promise. They felt like chains. They felt like hope.

All three were probably true.

He slipped out the back door into the sharp night air. The stars above were strange, the constellations all wrong, but the ache in his back at the satisfaction of hard work was a known quantity. Maybe that would be enough to build a new life on.

Maybe.

The door clicked shut behind him, and somewhere in the distance, a clock tower chimed the late hour. Dawn would come soon enough, bringing with it another day of knives and steam and Gareth's gruff assessments. Another day of proving himself. Another day of becoming whoever Caleb was supposed to be in this world.

His new life had begun, but what shape it would take remained as mysterious as the unknown stars above.

# IMPETUS crystals

In the [Fe3O4 Forward Original Highlight Medley](https://youtu.be/KVaL0_4mMDs) SQU4D showcased the members' Impetuses. They were described as love and each girl explained their own. I highlighted some patterns: Haewon and Sullyoon prefer to give love; Jiwoo, Lily and Kyujin prefer being loved while Bae can't choose between. Their IMPETUSes will gain importance the more we dive into the Blue Valentine Stage.

*We melt down the raw gemstones of our emotions and use them to fuel a new journey. When all emotions coalesce, they create the greatest power.*

Basically how the MMU engine works. All their crystals are connected together in a single core to power the ship.

**Haewon's IMPETUS**

*I don't think the shape of my love can be defined. There is* ***no clear form*** *- sometimes a* ***liquid***, sometimes a ***solid***, and with a soft, warm gray hue. It maintains a tepid temperature. ***I love giving love.*** *But when it is given to me, I worry I won't be able to return as much. When I consider someone ""my person,"" I give them my whole heart without limits. I want to continue sharing my warmth with you.*

**Jiwoo's IMPETUS**

*My love is* ***heart-shaped***, a mix of soft pink, deep pink, and sky blue. To me, love means that no matter what someone does - even when they're being difficult - you just can't bring yourself to be mad at them. When you're in love, doesn't everything they do seem adorable? ***I love the feeling of being loved*** *the most.*

**Lily's IMPETUS**

*My love is comprised of many colors. Passionate red represents my fiery energy, soft pink captures my romantic and tender feelings, and earthy green reflects my love for the people who matter most - my family, friends and fan. Beyond that, I experience the layers of countless emotions wash over me in a flood all at once. It's hard to sum them up with just one word. Only when these emotions in* ***different hues and shapes*** *come together do the true form and color of my love emerge.* ***I love being loved*** *the most. Giving and receiving both make me happy, but there's a special kind of joy in receiving love.*

**Kyujin's IMPETUS**

*My love is a* ***mix*** *of deep black, sleek red, and shimmering gold at the edges. I love both giving and receiving love, but if I had to choose,* ***I like receiving it*** *just a little more. Love feels both simple and complicated to me.*

**Bae's IMPETUS**

*My love is a mix of red and yellow,* ***sparking with electricity***. However, its ***shape is unclear*** *to me. Can something invisible even have a shape? Maybe that's why love can feels so hard to grasp sometimes, yet other times, it comes so easily To me, love means being willing to give up anything for the one I care about. Even if it requires a little sacrifice, I want to cherish and protect my love. I love being loved and always want to receive it. But just as much, I love giving it. It would be* ***impossible to choose between the two.***

**Sullyoon's IMPETUS**

*My love is like the* ***light from a flashlight***, glowing pink and white. To me, love means wanting to give someone everything I possibly can. ***I love giving love.*** *I want my love to bring you comfort, but also make your heart flutter.*

# Concept (Photos)

All NMIXX comebacks are inspired by a movie and this is not an exception. The original inspiration for this comeback is most probably **based on the 2010 movie Blue Valentine** starring Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams, where a couple relationship deteriorates overtime despite the love for each other.

***VALENTINE Ver.*** *The days were different with you, and different without you.*

In this shoot the girls are wearing the same outfits of the Webtoon. For the first part the girls were said to act bright, holding hands, smiling, laughing, playing... Lily called it LOVE concept. Then in the HATE Concept the girls were directed to be colder, alone, empty, sad.

Basically the message is: we loved each other but something happened between us and we're sad because we're not together anymore.

***BLUE Ver.*** *Our cake, sweet yet bitter, soft yet sharp - just like you and me.*

I thought the cakes represented the girls' IMPETUS so I tried to match many things between the crystals and the cakes (colors, shapes, descriptions, give/receive love and attitude in the Webtoon) but the only somehow consistent one is Lily's. I still want to believe the cake-impetus theory where the knife is the hate towards the cake of love. Haewon said in the Behind: *We used two props with completely opposite vibes, a soft. mushy cake and a glass knife \[not everyone had a knife\], fragile and therefore even sharper. We really brought out our Love & Hate theme.*

The cake of the Motion Poster is a mash-up of all the six cakes seen here. What's interesting is that the beating glass heart with blue liquid inside (IMPETUS) is shattered by the knife Sullyoon is holding in the photoshoot. Indeed, in a moment we'll see that she's the one who started the Love & Hate situation.

***CHAOS Ver.*** *To you, whom I love the most but hate.*

The phrase above is written on a blue apple. More orange apples with glass shards are used as props. Apples hold a strong symbolism given by many myths throughout cultures all over the world: temptation, love, discord, immortality. Knowing the past greek inspirations in NMIXX, ""To the most beautiful"" was the phrase written on the golden apple of discord thrown by Eris to Athena, Hera and Aphrodite which lead to the Trojan War.

Sullyoon has the Blue Valentine Cyber Sigilism scarification on her back. Here she's paired with Haewon who has smudged red lipstick. As demonstrated above, the Jacket is usually loosely related to the lore so this tattoo could mean her love left her hurt.

# Webtoon: BLUE VALENTINE

[Stuck in the Blue Valentine Stage](https://preview.redd.it/0toewm4aa4uf1.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bc36a1d907f759f1d5e97517d3f70ee0bb227fc)

To reach MIXXTOPIA, aboard the MMU, NMIXX enters a black hole that stretches out like the sea. They reach the ""Blue Valentine Stage"" (BVS) while sleeping, but woken up by the notification, they run to witness the mesmerizing blue waves of the celestial body.

They celebrate reaching this Stage with a party. A round of hide-and-seek starts with Bae counting. One by one, Bae tracks down Lily > Haewon & Jiwoo > Kyujin > Sullyoon.

Walking by some passengers, Jiwoo hears them talking of water leaking in a room and sudden dangerous ship movements. Haewon and Kyujin check the MMU Steering Wheel and find out that sparks erupt from it. Everyone gathers at the engine core. Haewon is clear: ""Look at the IMPETUS. The longer we stay in this stage, the more unstable it becomes.”

Bae and Kyujin, want to push forward despite the risks, while Sullyoon and Haewon question whether they should turn back, weary of repeated failures in past attempts. As the conflict escalates between Bae and Sullyoon, sparks shoot violently from the failing engine. Lily cries out in desperation for the fighting to stop. At that moment, the engine breaks apart with a loud tear. The IMPETUS flows in the room. Sullyoon turns her back on the group and walks away, with her IMPETUS leaving a trace behind here.

**EP.2 ""A Heart Split Into Six Pieces""** (full translation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMIXX/comments/1nuzxor/blue_valentine_webtoon_episode_2_english/))

On the MMU, passengers like Black Sheep, Talking Plant and Curly Girl discuss the split among NMIXX after the engine failure. Sullyoon and Haewon argue for turning back, while Bae, Jiwoo, and Kyujin push to continue. Lily is just upset by the conflict itself but as time goes by she'll end up in the Return Faction.

The group’s disagreements soon spill into personal clashes: Sullyoon and Jiwoo argue over sincerity and fear, Haewon and Bae quarrel playfully but reveal deeper frustrations, and Lily and Kyujin’s confrontation escalates into a fight after Kyujin admits her fear of failing again.

As tensions grow, small acts of spite and mischief spread among them, deepening mistrust. Soon accidents and near-attacks make the girls question if someone is truly crossing the line, from Sullyoon being shoved into water supposedly by Jiwoo who ran to help her instead to Lily nearly falling from a clean-cut railing, something only Kyujin could do. Suspicion isolates them, and they pass each other in silence, no longer able to communicate openly.

In the main hall, all the passengers are reunited for a public debate. Sullyoon and Haewon insist on returning, calling for safety and caution; Bae, Jiwoo, and Kyujin argue for pressing forward, and Lily pleads for unity above all. The passengers note that while their opinions differ, their motives all stem from care for one another. The girls begin to realize this too, though their bond remains fractured.

[I don’t want to hate you! No… I don’t even want to hate you! I don’t even know why we’re fighting anymore. This isn’t how it’s supposed to be! I can’t stand this any longer! This is just too much! I can’t take it anymore!](https://preview.redd.it/xczjz1xua4uf1.png?width=931&format=png&auto=webp&s=fce96a3d32caba0dddd689714384f4e4c13bc492)

**Webtoon Analysis**

Before getting into deep waters, let's note simple things:

* Pabllo Vittar spotted on the escalator during the Hide & Seek, right after Bae count.
* On board we have a Black Sheep and other humanoid animals, kids, schoolgirls, a man on a wheelchair, a girl with a robotic arm and a talking plant. The MMU is really inclusive!
* They reached BVS while sleeping, it's very common for them to reach places while sleeping.
* They're not inside the black hole yet. The blue waves that give the characteristic BVS stretch out from it and they're stuck there, since months.
* The MMU status heavily depends on the fuel, the IMPETUS, which comes from the six crystals of the girls connected to the ship engine. Since it's linked to their emotions it became unstable, leading to an explosion.
* Apparently failing and being reborn countless times it's normalized in the MIXX, When Sullyoon said that they've always failed at this (BVS) point nobody reacted.
* Interesting balloon ""*You won't run away now, will you?*"" from Bae to Sullyoon when catching her in the game. Sullyoon is called out as ""scared"" in two scenes by Jiwoo.
* Haewon said the problem is not external but comes from the IMPETUS, which is the crystallization of NMIXX emotions.

Theoretically, entering in a blackhole would require seconds due to the immense gravitational attraction, however they're stuck outside it in its (gravitational) waves. But we shouldn't think scientifically: this black hole is supposed to be a portal to MIXXTOPIA, the place beyond imagination, so right now we're at the edge of imagination and it's completely possible that physics laws are non-existing here.

**Who gave the Blue Valentine Stage its name?** Obviously Kyujin and Sullyoon, as they're the only ones that can remember past journeys. When this situation happened in the past and failed, they named it after the famous movie and Kyujin programmed the notification in the MMU. In fact, Sullyoon is the first person to wake up after the notification because she recognized it (and has probably PTSD from it).

The fact that they always failed at this point is clearly linked to the girls real desires to reach MXTP or it's bound to the girls' personalities. Have you ever gone on holiday with your friends and started hating them day after day even if you really love them?

To grasp the reason why Sullyoon's fear took over the excitement of discovery we need to look at how her past shaped her character. She's the Doctor and along with Kyujin, remembers all the past journeys. She believes that even this journey is bound to fail. To say such a statement with such an [animation](https://youtu.be/7Jj6R6khBd0) she must be really sure, there's no trace of hope there. The last journey failed due to a Kyujin mistake, but this time even Captain Haewon said the issue is not external. Is Sullyoon herself the reason why they keep failing? How could she be so bold otherwise? Thanks to the trial-and-error from past journeys she would have found the way to resolve the current problem as Kyujin did with her mistake from the previous one, but no. She **knows** NMIXX will fail and has no intention to solve the problem. Is the problem unsolvable? Is it because of her? Did she had to endure so much pain in the past she prefers not to achieve NMIXX dream?

At the end of the 2nd episode the girls talked out loud their emotions and intentions: their wounds started healing... Sullyoon's too? A snail on a leaf gives the reader a spark of hope as the animals embodies values like resilience, perseverance and steadiness.

[With our bond fractured like this… is there any way back to how we used to be?](https://preview.redd.it/eswirt3pa4uf1.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3e42c8b1e50acefce6c7895ca7193e1e6fa00f2)

# Paradox of Love Trailer

This film is narrated by a voiceover and showed as if we were watching a videocassette playing tapes of the girls fighting.

*Love / Hate: noun. concept. collision. Touch and recoil. Soft and sharp. A gaze. A break. No answers. Only feeling - styled and torn.*

* Touch and recoil: sounds of censored swear words, angry Lily arguing.
* A gaze: sounds of a tape rolling, Jiwoo staring and smiling.
* No answers: silence, Kyujin with her head tilted looking down on you. Kinda ""what do you want me to do?"".
* Only feelings: Sullyoon smiling with eyes closed and staring.
* Collision: sounds of a ticking clock. Haewon shedding a tear.
* Empty: static noise, Bae with a blank stare.
* Styled and torn: everyone doing the things above.

A communicator that gets angry? An engineer that has no answers? A captain crying? A scouter with a hollow gaze? Investigator and Doctor are too general to define but everyone else should definitely not have that attitude. This behavior is the natural reaction to the current situation on the MMU.

[\\""I know a place\\"" and they will bring you there](https://preview.redd.it/onqz88qv24uf1.png?width=1566&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d1b995c7f7a7ff291817c0a9ac809153ea515f6)

*Chapter 1: Love turns, beauty breaks. (Sullyoon & Jiwoo)*

A beautiful landscape of infinite green hills and flowers. A flock of birds flying away from the only tree. Jiwoo and Sullyoon completely in love with each other. Then Sullyoon's face darkens and turns. She is now physically grounded by Jiwoo. The two start wrestling but no one can win.

Love changes and it's no longer as beautiful as it was. Love can change so much it becomes hate. This scene gives the same vibes as the ending of Confession of midas girl, where Sullyoon's face, the visual of the group, cracks.

*Chapter 2: She focused. She let go. (Lily & Bae)*

Bae is inside a white room, looking through a manual phoropter Lily outside in the field. She's blindfolded with pearls and is firing bullets Bae's room. The glass protected her.

The Phoropter is the device that can correct the eyesight through various lenses. A scouter, whose role heavily depends on their eyesight should never have sight problems. But here Bae is fixing her vision. On the other side, Lily the communicator has abandoned the diplomacy and embraced violence. Hate really changes people completely.

*Chapter 3: Open hands. Closed heart. (Haewon & Kyujin)*

Somewhere else in the field, Haewon is about to insert a key in a keyhole on Kyujin's back. Fast flashes of the two being lovely. It's night and Haewon buried Kyujin with a shovel.

It's hard to interpret this scene. Haewon after unlocking Kyujin have a great time with her but when night comes... Haewon looks at the moon, both are not happy anymore and Kyujin seems blocked. Haewon gets rid of her doll(?). Is it a representation of a one-night-stand relationship? An egoistic one? In addition, Haewon is removing dirt but also compressing it: they made the un/digging purposefully ambiguous, as if she's torn between love and hate.

*You were watching love and hate. Where every touch becomes tension and every fight is just another dance. We have yet to find the answer. Do you know the solution to this collision? If so, please tell us. We will always be here. (To be continued...)*

The three pairs are playing tug of war, making colorful bubbles and looking each other at a fountain. In the next scene the atmosphere changed: Sullyoon is spraying only blue bubbles on a defenseless Jiwoo, Lily won the tug of war against Bae who is now on the ground while Kyujin and Haewon are avoiding each other gaze now. Seems like the Return Faction has the upper hand. Everyone has a heart shaped clock necklace.

**Trailer Analysis**

Is this landscape where Haewon watered flowers all over in LMLT MV? Maybe. We need to refresh how MIXX works. We left FIELD with a spaceship and at the moment we're at the edge of MIXX, stuck in front of a black hole, allegedly a portal for MIXXTOPIA. There's no way a infinite green field is near us now, unless... ""in MIXX territories expands with imagination"".

You might have noticed that in LMLT, WLC and here the starting place has always a white background, the girls wake up in it and then the green field appears. In particular, in WLC and PoL they all wear a uniform. Is this how the directors represent the imagination expanding? From a blank space to an infinte landscape? With this explanation, the green field can be anywhere the girls want it to be, also here in the MMU.

If we want to frame this Trailer we can say that it's the manifestation of NMIXX emotions during the BVS, a moment of contradictions, distortions, This green field is the conceptual space where they're fighting for their love and hate towards each other. ""*Do you know the solution to this collision? If so, please tell us. We will always be here. (To be continued...)*"" The collision is between the members who want and don't want to continue, they don't know how to stop this bickering. They will always be here because they're stuck for the n-th time. Who's talking can be either the members themselves or, more probably, MMU passengers who want to solve the issue and move on.

# Spinnin' On It MV

The video starts with the end: our six girls, in a house, divided in the two factions had a blue cream/cake-throwing war which ended when both teams collapsed, tired of fighting. Jiwoo eats a bit of cream from Sullyoon's face (her enemy), while Sullyoon treats Kyujin (from the enemy faction). A grey snail glides on the dirty floor.

In this video each girl has some representative items that her enemy will try to destroy to show their hate.

[Exhausted](https://preview.redd.it/mfekfxyyc4uf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fd4eb3cf145810bf446b4fd7fb0fc260d4ae3e8)

**Bae & Haewon war**

Bae opens a box and breaks all the eggs branded with Haewon representative word ""BELOST5"", transliterated ""biroso"", ""비로소"" meaning ""finally"", which as intended by Haewon is ""This is the me I've truly been longing for"". As she breaks the eggs, Haewon is really uncomfortable.

There are even more layers on this word: Be Lost? Getting lost in this universe of imagination or losing the ability of Captain in managing journey? Why 5? Haewon's last name is Oh and it means 5 in Korean. If you tie this thing with LOST being the opposite of WON and BE can somehow be paired with Hae, we maybe have the reason why she wants this to be her nickname on SNS.

It's Haewon turn. She's ironing some clothes with Bae's face printed on. She purposefully burn one if those with the iron. Bae now has the same iron branding Haewon made on the shirt on her neck. Ouch. At last, Haewon and Bae are sitting close in front of each other, Haewon is holding Bae's neck, touching and feeling her jugular veins with very intrusive thoughts.

**Jiwoo & Sullyoon war + Lily**

Lily is collecting Jiwoo's things because she likes her but sides with Sullyoon since she loves her too. Note that Lily is liking both members from the Forward and Return Faction. However, Lily's love for Sullyoon is not mutual. In fact, after getting a black ice-cream from Jiwoo, who is hiding behind the door, Sullyoon realizes she dislikes the taste and smashes it on Lily's collection. Actually Lily's folders were already dirty, so either it was not the first time Sullyoon smashed icecream on them or in this MV the scenes are not linear with time. By the way, Sullyoon still cares about Lily because she's caressing her eye some time after.

Anyway, the smash on Lily's Jiwoo's photo causes Jiwoo pain to the eye. In response, she bites a marshmallow, Sullyoon's representative item. A scene of Jiwoo biting her ear follows, as if the marshmellow and her ear were somehow connected.

https://preview.redd.it/akwbtlow84uf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c28d9ea1616d94fff65b72aa12708782255fb60

**Kyujin & Lily love**

Kyujin initially has no enemies, or better, all are. She spills coffee on the floor, prepare tacks-filled cupcakes and chocolates in her dark room, locked from the others (or are the others locked in the light room by her?). One of the chocolates in the box has a Lily photo and Kyujin takes a bite of it. A few scenes after, we see Kyujin having an intimate moment with her in the light room, feeding one of the box chocolates to Lily.

**All-out war, and love**

Bae is about to pop the egg in the light room. Haewon turns her head pretty (as always) worried. The big wedding cake bomb-candles are lit and it explodes, setting the beginning of the final war between the faction that will have no winners. The cake can easily be the representation of the IMPETUS engine breaking in the Webtoon.

Towards the end of the video all enemies become lovers: Haewon is seen having an intimate moment with Bae where she's playing with her earring. Kyujin and Lily are interlocking their feet (?), Jiwoo and Sullyoon look at each other.

https://preview.redd.it/7pio6oqq24uf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=813efb3afbf6f4e6bd9f2873566bf5d1a9e2a34a

In the light room there's a bed and a wall with many objects hanging. Let's list and divide them into categories:

* Analysis (Hearing and Touch): Recordings, gloves, pipettes, dinosaur skull fossil. Mainly linked to the Investigator and the Scouter.
* Haewons's: Scissors (one of these were also on Haewon's desk in SENSE BREAK AWAKE), perfume bottles (KAB/Webtoon). Watches (sound of time ticking in PoL), hammer (has a ribbon on it).
* Lily: High heels (spotted because of those in the Webtoon)
* Knives... Kyujin? If not, she's the only without objects here and it would makes sense anyway as she's working in the dark room.
* Doctor things: syringes, scalpels, stethoscope. Sullyoon for sure.
* Plaque ""I hate being without you"". Note that a snail was covering the ""being without"" before the final battle.

https://preview.redd.it/ivbmjqxh24uf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d78e03fac653f97b7a26121a3aa47dba355a3bdd

From the shared Google Drive we can find more of the girls' representative items:

* Haewon: eggs, ribbon, ""finally"".
* Lily: wild flower.
* Kyujin: blueberry, tea, coffee, nails.
* Bae: key, sugar, clothes.
* Sullyoon: marshmallow, black ice-cream
* Jiwoo: tomato, vinyl, pictures.

In the video you might have seen some flashy visuals of pictures of the items above. The [complete big picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMIXX/comments/1nwbf3c/spinnin_on_it_relationship_chart/) has these pictures divided by member and connected with others' as in a detective board.

The NMIXX Watermelon game is really fun but doesn't hold much lore.

# TL;DR

At the edge of MIXX, just before entering MIXXTOPIA, the MMU halts, as happened in the past. It's been months NMIXX are stuck before the black hole and the IMPETUS got unstable. The split between going Forward with the journey or Return for safety among them has ripped their friendship and the engine as well. This divergence led to hatred between them, even though they still love each other. After some pranks crossed the line, the tired girls might have understood that collaboration is key and a decision must be taken.

https://preview.redd.it/b9oo18w4d4uf1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=56659baf7b9102f930a4717d02ef8f8585fcc1fc

# Theories

There's not a fixed couple in the contents we analyzed, but for sure someone from the *Forward faction* always fought with someone from the **Return Faction**. For our theories let's consider the couplings from the Webtoon and Spinnin' On It MV as canon. (for the record, in Paradox of Love the only difference is that Lily and Haewon switched enemies)

* *Forward Faction*: Jiwoo, Bae, Kyujin.
* **Return Faction**: Haewon, Sullyoon, Lily.

**Whose hand pushed Sullyoon into the water?** Who really cut the railing? As readers of the Webtoons we know that no NMIXX member did it, so we can safely believe someone else in the MMU took advantage of the situation to put the Return Faction in real danger. Would you reach MIXXTOPIA at the cost of other lives? Since we're heading in a place where everyone is respected, disrespect should not be tolerated even on the way. Whoever did this level of mischief wants the MMU to keep going, to reach the utopia or to make the journey fail as fast as possible? Could this person (or people) be another unforeseen threat to NMIXX? What I want to say is: what if Monopole sneaked into the MMU?

**Who will win the dispute?** Realistically the best outcome would be Haewon's view: first understand the issue, then proceed. But time is ticking and without the IMPETUS engine the MMU is a lifeless hollow metal box in the infinte void. With a fresh and healed mindset after the bickering, the girls should learn the most they can (especially Kyujin and Sullyoon) from this situation, solve whatever problem is left and enter the black hole without regrets.

https://preview.redd.it/ltz2xgkt84uf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=28349002563b3b00336b2953edbe876dcfc8c226

# Outro

We're so close yet so far from MIXXTOPIA. I've seen many people saying the PoL field is the MIXXTOPIA we didn't expect, which is inherently not true: there ""*everyone's diversity is respected*"". So, how will MIXXTOPIA look like? We only know it's a legendary place where all dreams and wishes come true and considering how different the dreams of each person could be... for sure it's going to be a little chaotic!

Thank you for keep reading my theories, I know they're long but in these three years you probably got accustomed, right? For new NSWERs, you'll be very soon! See you in the next \[THEORY\].

# Price Comparison

Price plays an important role when choosing between mushroom coffee and regular coffee. Many wonder if mushroom coffee is expensive compared to traditional coffee. This section compares the prices to help you understand the differences clearly. Knowing the price difference can guide your choice based on budget and preferences.

# Mushroom Coffee Vs Regular Coffee

Mushroom coffee usually costs more than regular coffee. This is because it contains special mushroom extracts, which add to the production cost. Regular coffee is widely produced and sold, making it cheaper. Mushroom coffee is still a niche product and less common in stores.

Here are some key points to consider:

* **Ingredients:** Mushroom coffee includes medicinal mushrooms like chaga or lion’s mane.
* **Production:** Mushroom coffee requires extra steps to extract and blend mushroom powders.
* **Availability:** Regular coffee is available almost everywhere, while mushroom coffee is sold mainly online or specialty shops.
* **Pricing:** Mushroom coffee prices can be 2-3 times higher than regular coffee.

|Coffee Type|Average Price (per 8 oz)|Common Packaging|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Regular Coffee|$0.20 – $0.50|Ground, Beans, Pods|
|Mushroom Coffee|$0.60 – $1.50|Powdered Mix, Instant Packets|

The price difference reflects the unique benefits mushroom coffee offers. Some people pay more for its health properties and different flavor. Regular coffee remains the budget-friendly choice for daily drinking.

# Cost Per Serving

Understanding the cost per serving helps compare value clearly. Mushroom coffee servings vary by brand but usually come in powdered form. Regular coffee servings depend on the type—beans, ground, or pods. Mushroom coffee tends to have a higher cost per serving because of the added mushroom powders.

Compare these typical costs per serving:

* **Regular Coffee:** About $0.20 to $0.50 per cup
* **Mushroom Coffee:** About $0.60 to $1.50 per cup

Here is a simple table showing cost per serving for a common 8-ounce cup:

|Coffee Type|Serving Size|Cost Per Serving|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Regular Coffee|8 oz|$0.20 – $0.50|
|Mushroom Coffee|8 oz|$0.60 – $1.50|

Some brands offer bulk packs or subscriptions to lower the cost per serving for mushroom coffee. Regular coffee often has discounts and sales due to mass production. Choosing between the two depends on your budget and interest in the health benefits of mushrooms.

# Factors Influencing Price

Mushroom coffee has grown in popularity, but many ask: **Is mushroom coffee expensive?** The price varies widely due to several key factors. Understanding these factors helps buyers choose the right option without overspending. Prices depend on the type of mushrooms used, the brand’s reputation, packaging quality, and whether the product is organic or specialty. Each factor influences the cost and value of the mushroom coffee you get.

# Quality Of Mushrooms

The **quality of mushrooms** is a major factor affecting the price of mushroom coffee. Higher-quality mushrooms are cultivated carefully to maintain their nutrients and health benefits. Low-quality mushrooms may come from wild or poorly controlled sources, lowering the product’s price but also its effectiveness.

Important points about mushroom quality:

* **Source:** Mushrooms grown in controlled environments are more expensive.
* **Type of Mushroom:** Reishi, Lion’s Mane, and Chaga have different prices based on rarity and benefits.
* **Processing:** Proper drying and extraction methods preserve active compounds, raising the cost.

|Quality Level|Price Impact|Health Benefits|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Premium|High|Maximum potency and purity|
|Standard|Moderate|Good benefits, some variability|
|Low|Low|Minimal benefits, possible contaminants|

Choosing premium quality mushrooms means paying more, but also getting better health benefits. Low-cost options may save money but reduce the coffee’s value.

# Brand And Packaging

The **brand and packaging** affect the mushroom coffee price. Well-known brands often charge more because of their quality control, research, and marketing. Customers trust these brands more, which adds to the cost.

Packaging types also influence the price:

* **Single-serve packets:** Convenient but cost more per cup.
* **Bulk bags or tins:** Lower cost per serving but less portable.
* **Eco-friendly packaging:** May increase the price due to sustainable materials.

Brand reputation often reflects product quality and customer service. Lesser-known brands might offer cheaper products but lack consistency or transparency.

|Brand Type|Packaging|Price Range|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Premium Brands|Eco-friendly tins, single-serve packets|High|
|Mid-range Brands|Standard bags, mixed packaging|Moderate|
|Budget Brands|Basic bags, minimal packaging|Low|

Good packaging protects freshness and adds to the user experience. It also helps justify a higher price point.

# Organic And Specialty Options

**Organic and specialty options** raise mushroom coffee prices. Organic mushrooms are grown without pesticides or harmful chemicals. This method costs more but appeals to health-conscious buyers.

Specialty mushroom coffees may include unique blends or added herbs. These products often target niche markets and command higher prices. Examples include:

1. Mushroom coffee with adaptogens for stress relief
2. Blends with added vitamins or superfoods
3. Single-origin or rare mushroom varieties

Organic certification requires strict testing and standards. This increases production costs and final price.

|Option|Price Impact|Benefit|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Organic|Higher|No pesticides, safer for health|
|Specialty Blends|Higher|Targeted health benefits|
|Standard|Lower|Basic mushroom coffee|

Choosing organic or specialty mushroom coffee means investing more but gaining additional health and quality assurances.

# Where To Buy Mushroom Coffee

Mushroom coffee blends the rich taste of coffee with the [health benefits](https://gomehedi.com/best-mushroom-coffee-for-health-benefits/) of medicinal mushrooms.

Buying online suits those who want variety and convenience. Watch for shipping costs that may affect the total price.

# Specialty Stores

* **Health food stores:** Whole Foods, Sprouts, local organic markets.

Advantages of buying at specialty stores include:

1. Touch and smell products before purchasing.

* **Flexible plans:** Weekly, biweekly, or monthly deliveries.

* **Exclusive blends:** Some services offer unique or limited-edition mushroom coffees.

# Is It Worth The Cost?

Mushroom coffee often costs more than regular coffee blends. Many wonder if its higher price matches the benefits it offers. Understanding the value depends on health benefits, taste, and long-term effects. This section breaks down these points to help decide if mushroom coffee is worth the cost.

# Health Benefits

Mushroom coffee combines coffee with medicinal mushrooms like chaga, lion’s mane, and reishi. These mushrooms add unique health benefits not found in regular coffee.

* **Boosts Immunity:** Mushrooms contain antioxidants that support the immune system.
* **Enhances Brain Function:** Lion’s mane may improve memory and focus.
* **Reduces Stress:** Reishi is known for calming effects and reducing anxiety.
* **Supports Digestion:** Some mushrooms help gut health and digestion.

Regular coffee mainly offers caffeine and antioxidants but lacks these extra benefits. For people seeking natural wellness support, mushroom coffee adds value beyond a caffeine boost.

|Benefit|Effect|Mushroom Source|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Immunity Support|Strengthens defense against illness|Chaga, Reishi|
|Brain Health|Improves focus and clarity|Lion’s Mane|
|Stress Relief|Calms mind and reduces anxiety|Reishi|
|Digestive Aid|Improves gut function|Chaga|

# Taste And Experience

Mushroom coffee has a different taste than regular coffee. It offers an earthy, slightly nutty flavor. Some find it pleasant, while others need time to adjust.

* **Earthy and Mild:** Less bitter than regular coffee.
* **Smooth Texture:** Often smoother, with low acidity.
* **Varies by Mushroom Type:** Different mushrooms add subtle flavor changes.

People new to mushroom coffee may notice a unique aftertaste. It pairs well with milk or sweeteners to balance flavors. The experience is about more than caffeine; it adds a calming ritual to the day.

Compared to regular coffee, mushroom coffee has fewer jitters and crashes. Many enjoy this steady energy source. The taste may not replace traditional coffee for everyone but offers a new, interesting option.

# Long-term Value

Considering mushroom coffee’s price, long-term value depends on personal goals and lifestyle. It costs more but may save money on health-related expenses later.

1. **Consistent Health Support:** Regular use may boost immunity and reduce doctor visits.
2. **Reduced Stress and Fatigue:** May improve overall well-being and productivity.
3. **Fewer Side Effects:** Lower caffeine means less jitteriness and better sleep quality.

Here is a simple cost comparison:

|Type|Cost per Cup|Key Benefits|Potential Savings|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Regular Coffee|$0.20 – $0.50|Caffeine boost, antioxidants|None|
|Mushroom Coffee|$0.80 – $1.50|Health support, steady energy|Possible health and wellness savings|

For people valuing health and steady energy, mushroom coffee offers good long-term value. It suits those who want more than just a caffeine kick. The extra cost may be justified by its benefits and unique experience.

**Goal:** Add meaningful late-game depth — new risks, logistics, and consequences once a community is stable.



# 1. Cell Towers as Satellite Uplinks

* Each tower can be converted into a command uplink once powered.
* **Requirements:** Generator mod (rare), 50 materials, 20 circuits, 9000 influence.
* Grants **+1 outpost slot** (maximum 10 total).
* While powered, towers **add constant noise** to the siege meter and upgrade all sieges to **Haven-class** difficulty.
* Must be refuelled daily; disabling the generator silences the tower and removes its benefits.



# 2. Outpost Overhaul

* Every outpost can host **one morale mod** (chairs, campfire, coffee pot, etc.), capped at **+3 morale**.
* Each outpost may be **garrisoned by one survivor**:
   * The survivor **only spawns when the player is nearby** and **has no effect on wandering hordes**.
   * They defend the outpost during sieges while the player is present.
   * They can’t be dismissed unless the outpost is abandoned or they die.
   * Abandoning an outpost sends that survivor to the **Legacy Pool** (not death, not return to base).



# 3. Balance & Consequences

* Garrisoned survivors still **consume food**, raising upkeep.
* Extra outposts can offset this through food or fuel sites, but every powered tower increases material and fuel drain.
* The result: a living push-and-pull between **reach and safety** — every expansion makes life louder, harder, and more alive.



# Summary

A late-game “Living Network” where cell towers widen command range, but each signal wakes the dead.  
Power brings progress — and punishment.

1o2bod9,https://v.redd.it/f2g0d83xb4uf1,Water leaking inside the machine during rinse cycle [DeLonghi Dinamica ECAM350.55.SB],"Hi everyone,

I’m having an issue with my DeLonghi Dinamica ECAM350.55.SB.
It shows 2990 coffees made in the stats, so it’s not new but still in decent condition.

Since yesterday, I’ve noticed water leaking into the coffee grounds container, and sometimes also into the drip tray under the cup area.

To figure out where it’s coming from, I recorded a video during the automatic rinsing cycle — I actually placed my iPhone inside the grounds container to film the inside while the water was flowing. You can clearly see where the leak starts.

I’d really appreciate some advice from anyone familiar with this machine:
	•	Where could the leak be coming from?
	•	Could it be a hose or gasket/seal issue?

I can share the video if someone wants to take a look.

Thanks a lot in advance for any help 🙏

Sorry for my English, I used a translator in some places.

I live in Western Europe.

I’ve been working for several years in a small appliance repair service, mostly fixing automatic coffee machines. I know them very well. There’s a chance that the company I’m currently working for will close soon. I’m not planning to go to another workshop because the salary wouldn’t be any different, and I like good money. I’m thinking of trying to work for myself — going to clients’ homes and doing repairs on the spot if the client agrees with the repair price. Basically, doing the same thing, but directly, without a middleman.

I have tools: a set of screwdrivers and wrenches, a drill driver, an angle grinder, a multitool, and a corded hammer drill. And also — a Japanese saw that I really enjoy working with. I don’t want to buy anything else yet because I haven’t decided what services I’ll be offering, except of course for the consumables I’ll need.

I asked for advice from acquaintances and friends, and they suggest expanding the range of services, not limiting myself to coffee machines. But I have doubts: should I try to cover more areas, or is it better to focus on what I know and do well?

We've been married for six years. Good marriage. Or so I thought. Last month my ex reached out on social media. We dated for three years in college and it ended badly but we're both older now and he wanted to catch up. I mentioned it to my husband at dinner one night.

He got quiet. Really quiet. Then he asked if I was planning to meet up with my ex.

I laughed it off. Said maybe for coffee. No big deal. We're adults.

He put his fork down and looked at me. ""Are you serious right now?""

I got defensive. Told him he was being controlling. My ex and I had history and it would be nice to relive some of the good memories from back then. Just talk about old times. Nothing more.

That's when he said it.

""If you get to relive the old days with your ex then I guess I'll relive being a bachelor.""

I lost it. Completely lost it. Started screaming at him about how dare he threaten me like that. He just sat there calm as anything and said it wasn't a threat. It was the same logic I was using.

But I wasn't thinking logically. I was furious.

So I called my mom. Told her my husband was threatening to cheat on me because I wanted to have coffee with an old friend. I left out the part about my ex. Left out what I actually said. Just made it sound like he was the bad guy.

My mom called my dad. My dad called my brother. Within two days my entire family was blowing up my husband's phone. My brother showed up at our house and tried to fight him. My dad threatened to ""handle this himself"" if my husband didn't apologize to me.

My husband didn't defend himself. Didn't explain. Just packed a bag and left.

I thought he'd come crawling back in a few days. He didn't.

Two weeks went by. He stopped answering my calls. Changed the locks on our house. I had to get my stuff while he was at work because he wouldn't let me in.

That's when my sister asked me point blank what actually happened. She's always been the one who sees through my drama. I broke down and told her everything.

She told our parents. They were horrified. Not at him. At me.

My mom actually said ""What did you expect him to do? Pat you on the head and smile while you went on a date with your ex?""

My dad won't look me in the eye anymore.

My brother apologized to my husband. They went out for drinks. Now they're closer than ever and I'm the outsider.

I tried to apologize to my husband. Sent him long texts explaining that I panicked and made a mistake. He read them. Didn't respond.

I showed up at the house last week. He answered the door looking better than he has in years. Lost weight. New haircut. Confident.

""What do you want?"" he asked.

I begged him to forgive me. Told him I'd do anything to fix this. I was wrong about everything and I just wanted him back.

He stared at me for a long moment. Then he said ""I'm actually enjoying being a bachelor. Thanks for the push.""

And he closed the door.

My family blames me. My friends think I'm insane. And the worst part is I never even met up with my ex. I threw away my marriage for a fantasy that didn't exist.

Now my husband is thriving. He got a promotion at work. He's going to the gym. He's traveling. Meanwhile I'm 33 years old living with my parents and crying myself to sleep every night.

Did I really destroy everything over nothing or does he share some blame for giving up so easily?

It's only been a couple weeks I have started learning the language, I really like it so far.

I was trying to make some sentences about liking or not different stuff earlier but I'm not sure how exactly you can make this more ""natural"" in ukrainian.

If for example, you say: I don't drink coffee, I don't like that

Я ніколи не п'ю каву, я її не люблю

Я ніколи не п'ю каву, я не люблю

Я ніколи не п'ю каву, Мені не подобається

Я ніколи не п'ю каву Тому що мені не подобається

I'm still somewhat a bit confused if you can use люблю and подобається for everything and it is just a difference of loving/liking or not? As for the sentences, I'm not sure how ukrainian native usually speak if they mostly use ""because"" or if they just go straight to the point if you know what I mean

Another bonus question while I'm at it lol

I got told when you say for example, Щодня я намагаюся вивчати українську, це прекрасна мова, it is better to use гарна мова instead. I know the way of speaking may differ from region in ukraine, I'm just wondering if it is wrong or just weird or idk what.

1o2bdan,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1o2bdan/what_should_i_do_next_in_my_career/,What should I do next in my career?,"Ok this might get long but I think some backstory is necessary… I (28F) have been sort of jumping around in industries and jobs since I finished my undergrad in Political Science in 2020. The first job I had was a Customer Support Specialist with a B2B SaaS company, at which I worked extremely hard, developed an entirely new system for analyzing customer feedback that was really successful, and as a result I was laterally promoted (ie not really a promotion just a team switch) to the Product Team as a user experience researcher. I felt this  fell short quite a bit because the system I created saved the company hundreds of thousands, CEO was legit using the decks I built at our shareholders meetings, etc. The impact I made was huge so a lateral move just seemed really underwhelming and like i wasn’t being valued. 

Shortly after that move I got what felt at the time like an amazing offer - I was offered a job in the public sector and because of my degree in poli sci, this felt like a dream come true. I took this role after chatting with the CEO of the old company who understood and I left on semi good terms I’d say. I still occasionally reach out to the CEO for a coffee chat but he’s left the previous company (sold it) and now has a new business. 

I took the public sector job, and was quickly promoted (within 6 months) from entry level to mid level due to my performance. However, even with the move to mid-level I didn’t feel challenged in this role. It was A LOT of red tape and no one really valued efficiency or effectiveness, which was super draining for me. Also, there didn’t seem to be a lot of growth opportunities there beyond the promotion I was given since the number of positions is predetermined and no one was close to retirement. After 2 years there I took a leave for some family related issues. I needed to be close to them to help with what we were going through and the gov job was mandatory in person, in a town about 7 hours from my family, so a leave was pretty much the only option. 

To make money while on leave (completely permissible under the leave stipulations) I took a remote job with a start up on a 12 month contract, which will be up in February. I haven’t loved this job, I find the founders very difficult to work with/learn from and I feel like i’m essentially just doing grunt work when the position offered was to product manage and shape company strategy. 

Also during this time, I moved in with my partner in the same city as my family and we’ve built a life here (we’d been dating long distance while i worked far away in the public sector). I now coach teams outside of work, have a good social life, am a Godmother, lots of nice personal things! But with the contract end date approaching, I’m trying to determine my next move. 

Honestly… I’m just really unsatisfied with my career. I feel like at 28 I should be a lot further along than I am but I know I’ve jumped around a bit which is likely why that’s the case. I love being in the process improvement space, but I don’t really have the experience to be a product manager somewhere because i haven’t had that role yet. What is the best next move? 

Give this start up thing more time and try to extend my contract with them to hopefully gain more experience? 

Go back to my public sector job after leave is up and move 7 hours away from my partner and family? 

Apply for customer support roles at new companies and hopefully try to move my way up from there? 

Another option?? Any advice would be greatly appreciated! ",1,1760029036.0,work,0,1.0,False

I’m a first year, and three days ago I met this brunette in my social science lecture. We started talking after class because we both complained about the midterm schedule, then ended up grabbing coffee at Sid Smith. She was super easy to talk to  funny, kind of sarcastic in that “I’ve been through too many group projects” way.

Tonight we decided to study together at Robarts. It started totally normal  just notes, music in one AirPod each, making dumb jokes, etc. But it got late, and everyone around us slowly left and it was also one of the upper floors for ""quiet study"". The vibe kinda shifted. We were sitting close, and when she looked at me for a bit too long, I swear my brain just stopped working.

One thing led to another and, somehow, it actually happened. In one of the quiet corners on one of the higher floors. It wasn’t planned, it wasn’t even supposed to happen, but it felt weirdly natural in the moment.

Afterwards, we just sat there for a bit both kind of laughing and stuff, both kind of in disbelief. Then we cleaned up, packed our stuff, and walked back out like nothing happened.

Now I’m sitting in my dorm trying to process that I actually lost my virginity in *Robarts Library* of all places. It’s such a cursed, perfectly UofT way for that to happen.

I’ve been in NYC for about 7 months now, moved from abroad, living in Flushing, Queens. I’m a woman in my 30s and came with the hope of living this city as an experience, to really give it a chance. But the truth is, it’s been much harder than I expected.

I don’t really know anyone here, and as time goes by, the loneliness has started to feel overwhelming. I miss my family and friends deeply, but at the same time, I’ve realized that no matter where I am, I often feel like a stranger — like I don’t quite belong anywhere.

I miss the times when I truly felt like myself. I’ve always been an extroverted and communicative person surrounding by people, and back home once, I had such an exciting, full life. Now, even though I’m in New York, I feel like I don’t really have a life at all.

Some days, I just wish I had a friend here someone to talk to, grab a coffee with, or share a simple moment of connection.  It’s not just about being new in the city, I really needed a change in my life, it’s about trying to rebuild a life that feels meaningful again, and not knowing where or how to start. Lately, I’ve been feeling like I’ve lost my direction completely and sometimes, I can’t help but feel such a loser.

I’ve been struggling with doubts about everything — relationships, friendships, work, life goals — and it’s left me feeling really stuck and disconnected.

I’m really trying to stay open and not give up, but it’s been frustrating and emotionally heavy at times.

If anyone has gone through something similar, or has advice on how to rebuild your sense of belonging and self again, I’d be really grateful to hear from you.

SO fast forward to today. Our couch broke last month, and I took needing to buy a new couch as a sign to try to figure out decorating the space. She’s more minimalist and I’m in the deep end of maximalism and painting the walls with whatever feels like myself, cohesion be damned. 

So I’ve bought blankets (in off-white and the same green as the couch) so try to bring the spaces together in terms of color. I purchase curtain rods and I intend to put up semi-sheer linen curtains that are a cool light green color. ALL pillows (except for the pink and mini green one) will go in pillow cases in sage green and darker green. The long pillows are being donated since I refuse to spend $20 for ONE sham when there’s 4 pillows. I’ve also got some hanging lanterns I plan to place above the green couch so we can have a separate lighting option in that area (I wanna donate the lamps). Plus there’s no overhead light in the living room :D. 

My main issue is the tv stand. It’s just a plain one from Walmart and it was free .99 (thanks family). I really don’t want to buy a new one but the color doesn’t look good to me. I don’t know how I could possibly flip it. Was thinking huge doily beneath tv but eh?? Tv is also 55’ and the stand is for a 50’ so that’s why it’s in the awkward position. I want something with hidden storage bc the containers are an eyesore imo. Initially was gonna get a matching tv stand/coffee table/end table but that quickly got expensive. Thrifting also hasn’t turned up any stellar finds. Plus I’m on the fence about whether I want to get rid of a glass table for something that may not even be real wood. So my question is WHAT do I do lol. I’ve attached pics of the living room and some pictures of my bedroom to give a better idea of my decorating style. 

Also if anyone can offer advice as to what I should do with a space above my bed. Got a new bed set second hand there’s so much wall real estate that idk what to do with. I thought maybe beaded curtain but there’s no beaded curtain the width of a queen size bed. My room has changed quite a bit - will update later. 

Something to keep in mind: roomie doesn’t like mega size posters. Reminds her of the movies (in a bad way). Was thinking of putting prints above the green couch but no bigger than 8 x 10. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE ",1,1760028465.0,interiordecorating,1,1.0,False

It was relatively short, it was good, he texted me after, I said I had a good time, he asked what my schedule was like this week. I told him i'm free Thursday. He said he was putting it on his calendar.

We texted a little on Friday, and he was responsive, funny, and interested in my life. He has read receipts on, so it's pretty straightforward to tell when he's opening these texts. I texted him something on Saturday, and he literally never opened it, until yesterday afternoon. He told me, ""Sorry for the late reply, it's been one of the busiest work weeks I've had in a long time."" My thought to myself was okay, so what about Saturday or Sunday? No big deal. I texted him back jokingly about work, and the last text he stopped replying at 9pm last night and put do not disturb on. He opened it at 6 AM today, I can see the read receipt. But no reply, and no mention of, ""Hey, are we still on for tonight? What do you want to do?""

I work full time and am getting my Phd part time and have night classes some nights of the week, I don't have an abundant amount of free nights for dates. Thursday was kind of my only open night this week (I was suppose to be going out of town this weekend--I'm not now due to a dog/surgery/vet crisis, but he doesn't know that nor does he need to. We are seeing this super low baseline of effort with him operating on the assumption this is my only free night).

It's noon. At this point, do I offer Thursday night to someone else? He's super cute, and successful, so I'm assuming he's just not that interested, and is seeing more interesting women.",21,1760028361.0,AskWomenOver30,46,0.93,False

My girlfriend (26F) and I (30M) have been together for almost two years. We’ve had some rough patches, and about two months ago we broke up for two weeks before deciding to get back together and try again on healthier terms.

When she moved back to my country after living abroad for two years, she often stayed at my parents’ house (where I live) because she didn’t like being at her mom’s place. I didn’t mind at all — I was happy she wanted to be with me, while also keeping a healthy balance between together time and alone time.

Eventually, she got her own apartment thanks to an inheritance she receives monthly. I even advised her to stay with her mom a bit longer to save money, but she said she needed her peace. She’s in a more privileged financial position than me — I make more money from my actual job, but she has her inheritance and does small, unstable jobs here and there.

One thing that’s always caught my attention a little: I’ve paid for *all* of our dinners, dates, coffees, outings, etc. She’s invited me maybe three or four times in nearly two years. Sometimes when she pays, she even asks me to cover my half. She knows I don’t make a lot, yet I still make the effort to take care of her financially when we go out.

When I stay at her place on weekends (and occasionally on a weekday), I barely use anything — I don’t eat her food, I don’t use her toiletries, and if I drink a soda, I replace it. I always pay for our weekend takeout and lunches and dinners for both of us.

Recently, she’s been complaining about having less money because of some bad financial decisions. During an argument, she said she wanted me to “provide more” and “validate her” (she identifies as having an anxious attachment style). Then she told me she’d like me to help pay her *light bill* — about $100 a month — since I stay over on weekends.

That really threw me off. I don’t live there, I don’t keep any clothes or personal stuff there, and I already pay for every meal we share. I told her that staying over should be because she *wants* me there, not because I owe her for it. Ironically, earlier this year she was upset that I didn’t stay over *enough*. Now that I do, I’m suddenly expected to pay a bill?

I know her attachment style makes her crave reassurance and validation, and I’ve really tried to give that to her. But I’m starting to feel like it’s never enough — that she’s blurring emotional needs with financial ones.

**TL;DR;** : Girlfriend complains that I am not supporting her and should pay for her light bill. Is she being ungrateful in our relationship? AIO?",22,1760028161.0,AIO,80,0.73,False
1o2azbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AO3/comments/1o2azbz/8_simple_ways_i_learned_to_stop_overthinking_my/,8 simple ways I learned to stop overthinking my fanfics and just write,"Hello everyone. I am a fanfic writer, and like most of us, I have wrestled with creative blocks and burnout. Recently, a couple of my friends got inspired to start writing and asked me how I manage to finish things. Truthfully, I do not have any secrets, just a collection of lessons learned the hard way. I am definitely not telling anyone how to write. This is a peek into the self-talk and practical advice I give myself. Please take this with a grain of salt and just as a friendly shared experience—I hope it helps someone out there.

**One - The ""thinking too much"" trap**

You have the perfect AU idea, the best plot twist and a deep understanding of the characters, but you spend all your time daydreaming or outlining in your head. When you finally sit down, you feel exhausted and write nothing.

My fix: Write it out, no matter how messy. The idea stays in your head until you put it on the page. Even if it is just a scene, a piece of dialogue or an internal monologue, getting something down is a victory. It is for you first, and the finished product will be more useful than a perfect, unwritten idea.

**Two - The ""thinking too big"" trap**

You want your first fic to be an epic, 300k-word, multi-chapter saga with a huge cast and a complex canon-divergent plot. You get stuck on Chapter 1 because you cannot figure out the name of a tertiary character or how a minor plot point will connect 50 chapters later.

My fix: Start small. Write that one-shot, that small, satisfying scene or a short. Finishing a small project is a huge morale boost and gives you practice in plotting, pacing and character voice. You build the skills for the epic only by finishing the shorter pieces first.

**Three - The ""write-and-edit"" cycle**

You are a perfectionist with language. You write one paragraph, stop to fix a comma. You write three more lines, then go back to swap out a word for a 'prettier' synonym. This constant stopping and correcting drains your creative energy and makes the writing feel like a chore.

My fix: Draft first, edit later. Set a goal (one chapter, one scene, 1,000 words) and just get the story out. Do not allow yourself to correct typos or polish language until the draft is complete. You will be reading it over anyway before posting, so save the critique for the revision stage.

**Four - The ""no writing schedule"" problem**

You tell yourself you will write all weekend, then spend the whole time stressed and distracted, sometimes writing a lot, sometimes nothing at all. This bleeds into your other life activities, leading to burnout or guilt.

My fix: Set boundaries and deadlines (even if they are just for yourself). Look at your life and find a consistent block of time—30 minutes after dinner, an hour on Saturday mornings—and dedicate that to writing. Treat this writing time like any other important appointment. Remember, you have a whole life. Do not let writing be the only thing you do.

**Five - The ""procrastination"" trap**

You invent reasons not to write: ""I cannot write until I finish re-reading the whole canon,"" ""I need a better playlist"" or ""I will write when the house is cleaner."" You keep putting it off, and the fic stays in your 'Drafts' folder forever.

My fix: Make writing non-negotiable. If you are serious about finishing this, it has to be a priority. Think of it like brushing your teeth or making your morning coffee—it's a daily ritual or commitment that simply gets done. Even if it is only 15 minutes or 100 words a day, that consistency turns writing from an optional task into a habit.

**Six - The ""fear of feedback"" freeze**

You spend more time worrying about comments and reviews than actually writing. You worry readers will say your AU idea is a rip-off, or your characterization is wrong, or they will hate your ship. This fear can stop you from posting, or even starting, a story.

My fix: Remember your ""why"" and embrace the silence.

First, remember that you are writing for fun. You do not owe anyone a story, an update or even a response. Similarly, nobody owes you kudos or comments, so do not let the lack of interaction discourage you. If you are writing for yourself, that joy is enough.

Second, if people do comment on the story itself and they do not like the content (your ship, your trope, the ending), accept it. You cannot force a reader to enjoy your choices. If someone leaves a mean comment, accept that it is an undeniable truth of the internet that not everyone will like your work. Thank them for reading, take the useful criticism and forget the rest. You cannot please everyone, not even the most popular fics do! And remember that AO3 offers tools to protect your mental space. If you do not want any interaction, you can disable comments entirely, allow only registered users to comment or set them to require your approval first. This lets you share your work without needing to engage with the results.

**Seven - The ""perfectionism"" obsession**

You are so focused on achieving a perfect, instantly famous, ""kudos-worthy"" piece that you get paralyzed. You trash whole chapters because the dialogue is not 'sparkly' enough, or the theme is not 'profound' enough.

My fix: Embrace the imperfection. There is no such thing as a ""perfect"" piece of fanfiction (or any art). Different readers love different styles. One reader's favourite angsty fic is another reader's emotional turmoil. Do not chase an impossible, universal standard. Focus on telling your story well, and let go of the need for every sentence to be flawless.

**Eight - The ""lost joy"" burnout**

This is the big one. All the other problems—the fear, the perfectionism, the overthinking—add up to this. You realise you are stressed and miserable every time you sit down to write. You have forgotten the fun.

My fix: Take a break, or move on. If writing is causing you chronic unhappiness, you are either burned out and need to stop for a bit to recover, or you need to find a new outlet. If you discover the joy is still there—maybe in a different fandom or a shorter format—then focus on that moment of happiness: Finishing the chapter, sharing the fic or seeing that one reader who truly 'got' your idea. If you realise the joy is gone entirely, do not waste your life on it. There are a million other fun things to do.

So, now you have it. My 8 fanfic fixes.

Remember, this is purely subjective self-help I collected from my time in the trenches. I am sharing it because we are all just anonymous writers trying to get words on a page. I wish everyone happy typing, happy reading and zero fucks given about stats!

Thank you for reading. If you have your own unique way to beat procrastination or writer's block, please drop it below—I am always open to new advice.

P.S. I used the Resource flair, but I was debating Discussion (Non-question). Mods or veteran posters: did I pick the right one? Let me know!

Edit 1 - I am so sorry. I really didn't realise it read like AI. That makes me feel a little bit of a bummer. I genuinely put effort into writing that advice nicely. English is not my first language, so I work at it, no? I am now wondering if being clear and structured just sounds fake now.

I am a writer, but I’m also sort of a low-key pour-over coffee enjoyer after a trip to Vietnam several years ago. I’m writing a character who is extremely neurodivergent about coffee, and whose favorite is pour-over. However… finding deep dives into coffee that are both thorough and specific isn’t easy. I’m also a little intimidated by hobbies that have very vocal and opinionated enjoyers, so I will be honest, I couldn’t tell you what the difference is between a latte and a flat white. I would love to learn, but don’t know where to start!

So I figure I would extend an open invitation to have this sub infodump.

I would LOVE the most opinionated and pedantic coffee takes on here. What beans are best? How fine of a grind? How much do you portion? What supplies do you use? What sweeteners? Any accessories? What brands suck, and why? What tastes are your favorite and least favorite? How do you tell the difference? What kind of coffee do you make with it? Any specific rituals you think I need to observe? Non-negotiables? What’s a cardinal sin that I should never ever do or else go to hell with the devil and everything?

In case it is not clear — I *can* read basic guides and resources. That’s fine. And I have! However, I *specifically* want to hear your **most opinionated** takes, and that’s a little bit hard to find. I will believe everything you say though 😂",2,1760027973.0,pourover,23,0.54,False

1o2atmh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o2atmh,[Tenant US-AL] Landlord is charging us to replace the entire vinyl floor?,"My roommates and I need some advice. We just moved out of a unit that we lived in for two years in the state of Alabama. This unit is owned by a larger rental company who owns the entire apartment complex (and many others in our city), not a singular landlord.

Upon move-out, they sent us a bill for $1300 for, in their words, “we found small rips in the vinyl flooring in the living room. As a result, a charge for vinyl replacement will be included on your final move-out statement.” I’ve attached photos of the small rips (most likely from our couches or coffee table I am assuming over these two years). They are claiming the rips cannot be patched and the entire flooring must be replaced. We are wondering:

⁠1. Are we liable to replace the entire flooring in the living room? Landlord said they are charging us for the depreciated value of the floor and not the new flooring. They then lied and said that vinyl flooring can’t be patched, and when we told them vinyl flooring absolutely can be patch repaired, they backtracked and said that it wouldn’t uphold their “aesthetics” of the apartment.

2. If we are not liable, how do we proceed? They are also offering to go through our renter’s insurance, but I don’t know if that would be beneficial or fair — I called insurance and the agent said this issue isn’t covered, we have a $500 deductible, and the landlord would most likely also keep our $250 deposit.

Any help is appreciated! We are just looking to pay what is fair and right!",2,1760027773.0,Landlord,10,0.6,False
1o2asx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1o2asx5/varia_vs6_or_df83_starting_budget_750/,Varia VS6 or DF83? [Starting budget $750],"I just bought a Profitec Pro 600 and it's been a wonderful upgrade from my flaking GCP that has been slowly poisoning me for the past 2 years. Jokes aside, I now have a wonderful machine with a subpar grinder - the Fellow Opus. My gf doesnt believe I'll ever be happy but she doesnt understand the angst the Opus brings those of us who own it.

I drink both espresso and pourover daily. For pourover, I’ve got a ZP6 that I don’t plan to upgrade. This next grinder is **mainly for Espresso**, but it’s nice knowing both the VS6 and DF83 have burr upgrades for different flavor profiles of pourover down the line. I’ve read the Gold Supernova burr is amazing on the VS6.

For Espresso, I bounce between traditional and modern espresso. Right now, I’m loving Crema Bar from Saka, so, traditional, dark. But I do enjoy fruitier medium-light coffees from time to time. In generally I like trying new beans often and switching things up.

It seems like both grinders have that “end-game” reputation and seem super versatile for both traditional and modern espresso styles.

My **starting budget is around $750**. ""Starting budget"" because I already know I’ll be upgrading burrs later — and I’m fine with that. I just can’t justify dropping $1,400 (+ tax and shipping) on something like the Philos right now. Plus, I like the idea of looking forward to trying new/different burrs over time.

I’m leaning toward the VS6 because it can switch between conical and flat burrs, but I do wonder how it stacks up against a DF83 with something like the SSP HU or MP burrs. Can the DF83 still produce a traditional/conical style espresso? And if so, how does it compare to the VS6 conical burrs?

The main appeal of the DF83 for me is that it can take any 83mm burrs from different manufacturers, so it feels more future-proof and easier to talk about when comparing burr profiles. Unless I’m wrong, the VS6 only fits Varia’s proprietary burrs, which worries me a bit for the long run. Safe to assume they're done making burrs for it already, right?

I've heard they both have potential QC issues and at that price point that's a bit disheartening but I don't believe one ""brand"" to be significantly worse than the other (unless talking about the VS3). But please, correct me if Im wrong.

Which grinder do you think is the **better ""long-term"" espresso grinder**, ideally one that will keep me satisfied for years (assuming burr upgrades)? Or is there another grinder I should be looking at in this price range? I appreciate any and all responses, thank you! ",1,1760027732.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

We texted every day for like a week and almost all day back-and-forth. Questions of our family,how we grew up, religion, if I want kids and wanna get married, we’re both in our 30s. Everything aligned.  

He saved my number with acute emoji and like let me know that he loves getting text from me because he loves seeing the emoji, kept saying things like this isn’t really happened to me often, but I feel a really good connection with you and I’m excited to meet and hang out, things like I like getting good morning texts from you.. and I called him out saying I can’t tell if you’re a huge flirt or not, and he was surprised by that saying that he’s never heard that before. 

We met up a couple days ago and had a really good time we did make out twice and it just felt supernatural and honestly, the vibe was great. I thought he really liked me and I was a little bit hesitant about him.  
After he walked me to my car, we kissed goodbye. He said it was super nice to meet you and we just like hugged and stared at each other and then when he got home, he texted me goodnight, saying that he had a great time with me and that I was super cute.

The next day he texted me again at around 4 PM and we spoke a bit i said good night, he said it back and I didn’t reply and then the next day I texted him good morning asking him how his morning coffee is. He replied later in the day since he slept in saying that it doesn’t taste as good as me. 

We barely spoke that day text each other like every five hours and then last thing I said something about him being like such a great uncle and having fun with his nieces and he just hearted it. 

The next day he didn’t text me at all until I posted a Gym selfie and then he texted me asking me how my day was I replied, and then he didn’t text me until like 1 AM basically saying that he was home early, but went out with friends and so I replied in the morning just basically saying good morning and he hasn’t replied and it’s like 1 PM now

I posted on my story twice and he saw it.. 

I know it’s super soon and like I probably come off crazy but I just don’t know how to read this because I thought we had a good time. I thought he liked me especially texting me after the date and what not but now I’m like this is just a game and it seems like he just wanted to hook up.

**Why This Pick?**

After the Eagles took a loss to the Denver Broncos last week, I’m sure they’re itching for a win. But aside from that, while Jaxson Dart looked great in his last outing, some of the most promising components of the NY Giants’ offense are missing this evening (Malik Nabers is out, as is Darius Slayton due to a hamstring injury…) The League’s most recent Super Bowl champion has won 4 of their last 5 encounters with New York by at least a TD – I think they’re in a great position to do so again here. I’m on the Eagles to cover, friends.

He began waking earlier than everyone else. The coffee was already made, the table already set, but he’d just sit there, staring at the wall. When they asked what he was thinking about, he said, “Just keeping count.”
He stopped forgetting things. In fact, he seemed to remember too much, like conversations no one recalled having, faces they’d never met. Sometimes they’d catch him muttering in the hallway, like he was practicing names that didn’t belong to anyone.
At night, the humming deepened. The sound came from everywhere and nowhere at once, seeping through the vents, trembling the mirrors. No one mentioned it anymore.
Then one morning, the house was quiet.
The neighbors said they saw him leaving just before sunrise, calm as ever, adjusting his tie. They waved. He smiled, polite as always.
The family was never seen again.
When the police searched the house, they found everything perfectly in place, breakfast set for five, the kettle still warm, and a faint hum lingering in the air.

I also photoshop my posts and filter my videos—something I'm transparent about with my followers. Occasionally, I post unedited content, which no one even notices when it's not edited. If this is a collab shoot, should I disclose to them that I will be editing the pictures when posted to my own page? I don't expect them to do the same for me on their page.

*Hello everyone, this is the first transcript that isn’t from Aiden. I decided to include a segment from Janice to convey what happened with Mr. Rochambeux. Hopefully this will give you a wider view of the events that were taking place at this point. And don’t worry reader, I’ll include a segment of my interview in time. Right now I am still sorting through all the documents I liberated and ascertaining what is most pertinent. I’ve also noticed a strange white figure staring at me from outside my motel window from the times of 3:33 AM to 5:45 AM every night and I don’t know whether I’ll need to pull up stakes again soon.* 

*I would also like to note for thematic purposes that I transcribed this segment while listening to “Cumbersome” by Seven Mary Three.*

**Transcript 2: Part One.** 

\[Agent #2\] Hello Mrs. Freeley, how are you doing today! Can I get you anything? A coffee, maybe a soda pop? Any other food or possibly drinks to consume?

\[Janice Freeley\] No.

\[Agent #2\] Well then! Would you like to get back to it? I believe you were about to tell me about Mr. Rochambeux. 

\[Janice Freeley\] You never told me what agency you are from.

\[Agent #2\] Well that doesn’t concern you sweetheart. Why don’t you tell us about Mr. Rochambeux, the quicker you finish the quicker you can leave. 

\[Janice Freeley\] Fine, fuck you by the way. 

\[Agent #2\] No thank you!

\[Janice Freeley\] Wha-what? Oh nevermind, you’re just trying to weird me out by acting like a disconcerting freak, it won’t work, I’ve seen what real freaks look like. 

\[Agent #2\] Please continue!

\[Janice Freeley\] Whatever. Alright so me and Aiden got in the truck and left…we left Clarence’s house. God, I was mad at him I…I was so mean to him, it, it wasn’t his fault why did I make him think it was his fault?

\\\[Agent #2\\\] \*Hiccups once.\*   
  
  
  
\\\[Janice Freeley\\\] Well…we got in the truck and started driving to Rochambeux’s house. It was about twenty minutes away, all the way through town and out the other side. He lived on one of those weird country roads where there’s just randomly a single street of suburban houses surrounded by wilderness. I hadn’t been to his house before but Aiden was in the ping pong team at school and Rochambeaux had gotten in trouble for having players practice in his garage.  
  
  
  
\\\[Agent #2\\\] Why would that get him in trouble?  
  
  
  
\\\[Janice Freeley\\\] Because Rochambeux was a creep. He made weird comments about the high school boys and the girls in his class all the time but he never crossed the line enough to get in trouble, or at least not enough to get turned in. He was just like an equal opportunist pervert. Him and his wife were swingers, both were fat and for a while they had some nineteen-year-old girl living with them but that fell through and she stole a bunch of their money and their car and was never seen again. Everyone at school used to say he had orgies in his house for all the forty-something swingers and cuckolds.   
  
  
  
\\\[Agent #2\\\] Did you suspect he killed your brother?  
  
  
  
\\\[Janice Freeley\\\] I…I don’t know what I thought. I was angry, I drove fast. I guess I kind of thought that if anyone was killing people for thrills it would be Rochambeux, he also was good friends with the Deputy, allegedly the Deputy was a cuckold and liked to see his wife get turned out.   
  
  
  
But, I think a large part of me just still couldn’t believe any of it. He just gave me somewhere to focus my anger. I pulled into the driveway of his shitty little 50s style house spinning gravel and jumped out of the car without waiting for Aiden. I didn’t have a plan yet, I was just angry, I didn’t even have a gun so I couldn’t murder him or anything even if he said “I did it” right to my face.   
  
  
  
So I knocked on his door and waited probably a minute before knocking again, I heard heavy breathing in the house and then heavy footsteps until the the door was hit with a wet meaty thud and he called out,   
  
  
  
“Who’s there goddamnit!”   
  
  
  
“Janice Freeley and Aiden McGowan.” I yelled back.  
  
  
  
I heard locks getting unclasped, a lot of locks in fact, and when the door opened Rochambeux was standing there with a big grin, he was sweaty, red-faced, and didn’t have anything on except a bathrobe the color of spoiled milk that had a big red stain on it and ended at his knees. He was breathing heavily, his balding brown hair was just matted in sweat, like he had been running a marathon, and he had this gross little grin on his lips.   
  
  
  
“Well I’ll live and breathe! Janice and Aiden! What brings y’all round here!”   
  
  
  
“I wanted to ask you a few questions.”   
  
  
  
He frowned, “Bout what?”  
  
  
  
“About the night Derrick died.”  
  
  
  
He made this hissing noise and pretended to be sad, I could tell he was pretending, “Heard about that. I’m sorry about your brother Janice, really am. You two want to come in here and talk on the couch? Sorry I’m not more presentable but I was entertaining a guest.”   
  
  
  
I nodded, I didn’t want to go inside but I wanted him to let his guard down. Aiden seemed reluctant but he followed and I sat down on one of those red couches covered with plastic sheeting. The sheeting hadn’t been cleaned for a while, it was all scratched and covered with smudges from, I hope, food. Aiden stood behind the couch as I sat down on and looked at Rochambeux who was smiling from across the coffee table.   
  
  
  
“You two are looking good.” He looked up at Aiden, “You have a lot more tone in your arms than the last time I saw you boy, bet you're getting alllll the pussy now!” He laughed and I cracked a slight smile to disarm him. “Sorry about that,” he said wiping away a tear, “I get uncomfortable around grief. When my old man died I skipped the funeral and drank wine. Then I got my dick sucked and fucked on by a big ol’ bitch I met on Ashley Madison.”  
  
  
  
“That’s great man, so uh, Janice has some questions.” Aiden was awkward, he later told me Rochambeux’s ""strategy"" was to come on stronger with men than women because they were less likely to tell anyone.

“Well what’s the question?” He leered at me.

“Do you like walking in the woods at night?”

He looked confused, I had been trying to throw him off track, to see if he got nervous, “What? I think I need more explanation.”

I kept my features neutral, “Do you or any of your...buddies who share your hobby, walk in the woods at night? Naked.”

He leered again, “Hell, that’s not my thing sweetheart, me personally I’m scared of the dark.” He leaned over the table, “I know some people who like to get…frisky in the woods but I never liked that either, all the bugs and dirt getting in your crevasses, not my thing.” He shuddered, “I have a thing about bugs. Phobia’ from my childhood.”

His eyes went up to Aiden, “So are you two screwing or what?”

Aiden went red, I kept my face neutral and said, “No.”

“Wellll why the hell not! You’re both 18 now! We’re all adults here!”

He reached under the coffee table and grabbed a bottle of half-empty wine. Its color matched the stain on his robe. “So what’s this question have to do with me?”

“Just curious,” I leaned over on the table too and tried to look like I was checking him out, his pupils widened, I could tell he was too stupid to think I was manipulating him. “Which of your friends like to screw in the woods?”

He laughed, spitting wine all over his chest and robe before he wiped his mouth with his sleeve, staining the robe further, “Jesus girl! You grieve the way I do! But no. I don’t tell on my friends, being in my…lifestyle means you have to keep people’s secrets unless they give you permission.”

I reached over the couch and grabbed Aiden’s hand and put it on my shoulder, “We’re interested for legitimate reasons.”

“Wellll, I can tell you but I need permission first. Of course, if you want to meet me and Vanessa later that can be arranged, not right now though. I’m a little…spent.” He waved at his crotch and looked up at Aiden.

“We can share numbers.” I held my phone out to him and his smile widened.

“Alright then!” 

When we exchanged numbers I stood up and stretched and looked down at him, I circled him and started rubbing his back from behind, Aiden looked at me with horror and I mouthed at him to stop, I pulled the robe open slightly and looked down-

\[Agent #2\] And?

\[Janice Freeley\] No moles. His hair had kind of looked like the guy in the picture, patchy and balding on the top, but…no moles. I made some excuse and me and Aiden hustled out of there, got in the truck and left quickly. 

He turned to me and said, “What the fuck was that?”

“It’s called getting information.”

“He was looking at me like a piece of steak! You made him think we were going to fuck him!”

I laughed, I laughed for the first time since…since he died. “Oh come off it Aiden. You’re a man, you’ve had one pervert size you up, you’ll live. Women go through it all the time.” 

He shuddered, “God, he was worse in there than he was during ping pong practice. It was all careful innuendos back then.” 

“Well don’t worry dollface I’m not going to slut you out to Rochambeaux, I just need him to tell me who’s having woods orgies.”

He went quiet for a bit, he must have been choosing his words carefully, “You think whoever is doing that…that they…”

I didn’t answer for a while. “Maybe. Not sure how it leads to…what they did but, people naked in the woods? Weird costumes? It has to have something to do with the pictures on the trail cam. It just has to.”

He nodded, I don’t know if he believed me. I think at this point he believed there was something going on of course, the trail cam pictures and the people threatening Clarence were undeniable, but I don’t think he had any faith that we were onto something. Maybe it was more that he couldn’t believe that we could do anything.

“It wasn’t Rochambeux in the picture though, he didn’t have those moles on his shoulder.” 

Aiden grunted in acknowledgement, “Well, I didn’t really think he was quite pale enough to be that guy anyways.” 

I sighed, “Maybe we should check out cops, that will narrow it down.” 

He nodded silently. I didn’t like it when he was quiet. Made me think that he was judging me, thinking I was just crazy from the grief. I guess he was right. 

\[Agent #2\] About what?

\[Janice Freeley\] That it was driving me crazy. The grief. The loss. His absence. I used to pick up his cereal bowl everyday and yell at him for not putting it in the sink. I used to have to remind him to put on deodorant every morning. I used to have to tell him to look both ways at the stop sign. I used to tell him he was normal, that no one could take away his self-worth if he didn’t believe them. I told him that he would be fine and would live a normal life and Dad had been wrong. 

Jesus. Fuck me I’m telling some man in black all this shit. 

\[Agent #2\] Woman. And it's all right, take your time, we can have a break if you want. 

\[Janice Freeley\] No. No. I want to get through this part at least, fuck. 

Well, I drove him back to his place, Aiden, and then I went home. I was rude as hell, didn’t say thank you or goodbye. He let me do it, whether it was him respecting my grief or his crush on me…who knows. Whatever it was I exploited it. I exploited him a lot.

But I dropped him off and went home. Home. I hate that place, hated I guess. I parked my truck and went up the stairs, my Mom’s apartment was three flights up, and knocked. She opened the door, her eyes were bloodshot, lids sagging, teeth all yellow, she smelt horribly of weed, I hadn’t cleaned the apartment in a week and she had already trashed it, there was a bag of Chinese take-out on the table in front of the TV and trash all around it, the couch had cans of hard seltzer wedged in the cushions and was covered in cat hair.

\[Agent #2\] You have a bad relationship with your mother?

\[Janice Freeley\] Everything I did in life before Derrick died was to be the opposite of her. I never used drugs, drank, or partied, I wore outfits, I didn’t date, I took care of Derrick, I always kept everything clean. She made me a buzzkill basically. Her and Zachary. 

\[Agent #2\] Zachary?

\[Janice Freeley\] My biological father. Stop distracting me.

So my whore mother was standing there, breathing out her mouth like a fucking moron and I pushed my way past her. She had been saying all week that getting high and drinking was her way of “mourning.” She was lying of course, she did that all the time. Her room’s door was propped open and I could see her camera propped up on a tripod. She hadn’t even stopped doing camshows for a week when her son…when her son…she didn’t even make much money from them!

I need a minute.

\[Agent #2\] Take your time. 

\[Janice Freeley\] Quit saying that! Ok, so I walked in there and started making myself something to eat on the stove, she hadn’t saved me any food, I didn’t need to ask, and she plopped back down on the couch and she tried to rub my back like she was comforting me, like she was trying to be my mom for a moment, and I swatted her off so she went back to the couch. She fell asleep watching some adult cartoon about animals going to therapy and I went to my room. I didn’t have the energy to clean up. I don’t know when I fell asleep but it was morning when my cellphone started buzzing, it was Aiden of course. 

I hoped it was something to do with the case of course so I yelled. “What?”

“Janice…did you see the news?”

“What news?”

“I guess you haven’t seen it then.”

“Oh my God just say it.”

“Janice…Rochambeux is dead. He died last night”

“What.”

“I saw it on facebook this morning, his wife found him dead in the garage.”

I sat upright and began getting dressed. “How’d he die?”

“They don’t know yet, but Janice…the police say he was covered in insect bites.”

I felt sick to my stomach. I rushed out of my room and nearly ran over my Mom. She was wild-eyed and looked up at me and said, “Did you hear the news?”

“Rochambeux.” I muttered. 

She looked at me quizzically, “What? I meant the lights.”

“What lights?” I was getting annoyed at this point. 

“The lights in the sky last night, there’s a video of them on Face-”

I wove around her, and threw my jacket on, checking my phone briefly. My heart stopped when I saw I had received a text from Rochambeux at 3:33 AM last night. It read: 

**Withrow. Dentist.**

\[Agent #2\] What did that mean to you?

\[Janice Freeley\] I knew what Rochambeux meant. Withrow, the dentist, he was the naked man in the woods.",2,1760027529.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

They’re not cheap, at £5.90 per lb bag, but if you’re low key obsessed with finding options beyond your standard pinto or black turtle beans, I think it’s worth it. I didn’t stick to Mexican for my options - I also got a couple of their other heirloom varieties of Lima (Butter beans in British English), Baby Lima and Cannellini (the Marcella).

1o2akpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1o2akpu/i_ask_for_a_sign_and_still_doubt/,I ask for a sign... And still doubt...,"Greetings everyone. I'm writing this out of my head so I'm not sure how long this post will be, but I hope someone will have time to read it and just give any comment on it.

To give a bit of a background about me, so you have clearer picture. I'm in mid 30s, grew up in mixed marriage of Orthodox & Catholic parents - faith was never more than Christmas and Easter celebrations; but I went to mass with my sister in my youth. In high school I grew interest in religions in general and started studying them - went to synagogues, mosques, various temples, etc. to learn about other religions and along that spiral I lost my faith and just concluded that God does exist but we are simply irrelevant creation and God is more of a passive force. This ended up in me becoming pagan, but then I dropped that as well, etc. etc. 

Fast forward to recent time, some things (beautiful ones) have happened in my life and I again came to study some Christian themes and along that path I stumbled upon Council of Trent - and listening to him for days, I started to grow interest in my faith. I installed Verbum, subscribed and started to spend my free time studying the Bible and go much more in depth with it. But yesterday, I stumbled upon ""James, brother of Jesus"" and again researching James I started to question everything - various sources, various opinions and I just felt hurt in a way that it was all really just made up, collected to have unified meaning and that's about it. It was like I was reaching confidence in faith and it all suddenly again collapsed within hours. 

I got to bed yesterday, feeling again empty and in a way disappointed, even hurt. And before sleep I closed my eyes, and just said with such sorrow: God, just please release me of this misery and confusion; of this spiritual suffering - just something out of ordinary. Jesus, please just encourage me with a sign and I will carry my cross. And I went on YouTube, watched some random videos of AI psychosis and just two, three hours later I went to sleep. 

And I remember my dreams very rarely, even when I do it's so shallow that I forget it after my morning coffee. But last night, when I've asked for a sign; I had such a vivid dream, I could see every detail of a bench in a park; and this light gentle hand came from nowhere - it wasn't exactly from the sky, but it was above me - and it held me by my upper arm and started to pull me towards the sky, but gently, something like you would take a baby by the hand and pull gently to redirect it and make it walk in the direction you want; and moments later I woke up, I can't even say I woke up because it felt like I just went from that scene to seeing my bedroom ceiling, and I just thought: ""Wait, that was a dream?"" 

I got up to drink water and got back in bed, I wanted to wake my wife to tell her about this but didn't want to wake her up. I went back to bed and went back to sleep, I then had my usual vague dreams that in the morning I couldn't really recall, but the images of the park and that hand it still so vivid in my mind. 

I told this to my wife and she was amazed, she went to pray immediately. Then, I as I was thinking about this experience at work, it hit me... Ahh, I just put lots of emotion in this thought and had a lucid dream; my mind just put together what I desperately wanted. But then again, when I recall lucid dreams I used to (rarely) have in my early 20s, they all followed a same pattern of flying through space and I was completely aware it was a dream. 

And now I find it funny, and confusing. I ask God for a sign, I got out of ordinary experience just hours later, and here I am, typing this post and still having doubts in its authenticity despite being very open to such experience - and I think to myself, I who am seeking God and am very open to it, craving for proof, got it and I still question it... And now I somehow understand when people say ""Well why doesn't God do XYZ to prove His existence"" man, even if XYZ happened, many would still doubt and find other explanation for such occurrence. 

I'm not sure what kind of reply I'm seeking from people here, I just wanted to share my experience with someone and see maybe other people's perspective on such things. Maybe share your own?

I’m having an issue with my DeLonghi Dinamica ECAM350.55.SB.
It shows 2990 coffees made in the stats, so it’s not new but still in decent condition.

Since yesterday, I’ve noticed water leaking into the coffee grounds container, and sometimes also into the drip tray under the cup area.

To figure out where it’s coming from, I recorded a video during the automatic rinsing cycle — I actually placed my iPhone inside the grounds container to film the inside while the water was flowing. You can clearly see where the leak starts.

I’d really appreciate some advice from anyone familiar with this machine:
	•	Where could the leak be coming from?
	•	Could it be a hose or gasket/seal issue?
	•	Is this something I could fix myself, or should I take it to a service center?

I can share the video if someone wants to take a look.

Thanks a lot in advance for any help 🙏",1,1760027148.0,DeLonghi,1,1.0,False

**Short answer: yes**, training for a 70.3 was worth it. **Long answer:** **hang around for some context.** 

**Less than a year ago,** l signed up for my **first half Ironman** and since then I've been hooked. 

I've completed 3 half ironman's to date and **here's** **a few things I've learned.**

**First lesson: this sport is an investment.** Race entries, travel, gear, nutrition and tune ups all add up. I've spent over a couple grand this year alone, but I’m also making an investment in my health, fitness, and future. The ROI has included more energy, better habits, and learning from the best.

**Second lesson: protect your time.** Training double digit hours a week doesn't happen without planning. Finding a schedule that works with your life is the best plan. Block your key sessions like meetings and trim the fluff. With more structure I’ve lowered my stress and become more present in life outside of triathlon.

**Third lesson:** **what you do outside of training is just as important.** Feed the work with plenty of carbs, high quality protein, and tasty homemade meals. Pound water like it’s going out of style, salt based on your sweat rate and environmental conditions, and ditch alcohol if possible. Guard bedtime, because sleep is precious and naps don’t make up for lost hours. With my food, fluids, and sleep in check I feel more recovered and ready to tackle the next session.

**Fourth lesson: have fun.** If you’re not enjoying the process, what’s the point of going down the rabbit hole? Pick routes you love, add a coffee stop, train with a friend, go hard to your favorite playlist, or practice a skill just because it’s satisfying. Celebrate small wins—better sleep, a smoother swim entry, and a steadier bike. Treat race day as the party for the work you already did, not an audition you have to pass. My joy in the sport is what fuels consistency—**fun creates willpower.**

Continue to stack those pieces and race day will feel simpler—fewer surprises, more control, more fun.

1o2aj2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/StyledAndSnatched/comments/1o2aj2l/i_finally_found_the_best_wireless_bras_that_still/,I finally found the best wireless bras that still support without looking like sad sports bras,"Okay listen. I’m in my wireless bra era. Underwires? We’re done. It’s over. I’ve broken up with them for good and honestly, I feel free. But here’s the thing they don’t tell you in all the cute TikToks about going wire-free: most wireless bras are either flimsy little triangles or they flatten your chest like a binder. No thanks.

So, after what can only be described as a journey of spiritual growth and credit card damage, I found a few wireless bras that actually support, actually shape, and actually make me feel like a hot, glowy guest at a summer wedding instead of a tom boy in a hoodie. Here’s what I tried and what I loved.

A friend urged me to try True & Co. body lift scoopy neck bra thing. To be honest, I wasn’t a fan of the look, but this one feels like a hug for your boobs (in a good way). So smooth. So soft. If you don’t need major lift and just want to feel like you're floating through a cloud, this one’s solid. But I wouldn’t wear it to dance at a wedding unless you’re okay with the girls vibing freely.

I remembered seeing the Harper Wilde bliss bralette in a magazine somewhere and ordered one of those, too. Just to have something else to compare. Minimalist, sporty, but still supportive enough for errands and coffee runs. I reach for this one when I want to feel put together in a ""cool girl in bike shorts"" way, even though I haven’t biked since 2008.

You know I'm a fan so I had to try the Honeylove crossover bra. Girl. It gives you that lifted, sculpted shape without a wire in sight. It's sexy and chic, works for running through the airport, but also comfy enough to literally nap in. If you’re looking for one that works under low-cut dresses but still keeps the girls secure, this is it. Chef’s kiss. Top choice. Hands down. Winner, winner, chicken dinner. My only complaint is that it's a little full coverage for some outfits. 

I also grabbed their V-neck bra to try because it gave me a discount code to use so I said, “why not?” It’s supportive but soft, no uniboob situation, and the V shape means I don’t have to worry about it peeking out under my wrap tops. Also makes me feel kinda expensive? Like I’d order a $6 latte and not even flinch.

But I also tried their no-wire push up one. I was skeptical at first, but this is actually cute and gives a bit of shape. It’s got some push-up magic going on but it’s subtle. Not “I’m trying to seduce my boss” level, but like... flirty brunch energy. The band is soft but I will say the sizing ran a little small for me so maybe size up?

So yeah, the crossover is probably the one I love the most, especially for any kind of special event or “main character” moment. I’m wearing it under a dress for a friend’s wedding next month and I already know I’m gonna brag about it in the bathroom because it seriously makes you look soooo supported.

Anyway, I’m always on the hunt, so if you have any other recs for wireless bras I’m all ears!
