I live in Brisbane, QLD and hoping to find somewhere to go on a holiday for a week in December. It's not really enough time to go overseas so I'm thinking domestically.

My top choice is Perth, my partner's top choice is Melbourne - neither of us like the idea of the other's top choice 😂

I love the beach and nature, snorkelling and diving would be amazing. My partner likes food, coffee and hiking. We are trying to find somewhere that we both get to enjoy the things we like doing. Does anyone have any recommendations? Doesn't have to be a big city, in fact might be nice if it isn't.

1o9m4ea,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstory/comments/1o9m4ea/the_perfect_gift/,The Perfect Gift,"New account cause this is a very dark short story. 
I've been considering submitting this to some literature magazines while I'm taking a break from a full length manuscript I'm working. I wanted to see if it was too dark. Let me know what you guys think. Trigger warning for some of you it deals with very dark thoughts and actions. 

The Perfect Gift. 
I realized from the moment my first was born I wanted nothing more than to make my family happy. I would do anything to make that happen. I believed it was my responsibility to create the kind of home where they could grow and become as amazing as I knew they could be.

Lately, I’ve felt more like the reason everything is falling apart. It’s in the way my wife looks at me when I come home from work; tired, distracted, like she’s running on fumes and I’m one more thing draining her. The way my kids flinch when I raise my voice, even when I’m not angry. I lie to myself that they’re just stressed, that all families go through this. Deep down, I know the truth.

I’ve become the noise that drowns them out. A humming stress that smothers their calm.

My wife was amazing from day one, far more than I ever deserved. I wish I could make her shine the way she did after our lips touched for the first time. It was like little tendrils of electricity lighting up my spine. One look on her face told me it was the same for her. I think about that every time I see the stress or irritation on her face now, how happy I used to make her. How unhappy I make her now…

Her love hasn’t faded, but her spark has. I know I’m stressful to live with, forgetful and easily distracted, and the long hours I spend at work… Even with the overtime I'm still not providing the life they deserve. 

She thrives on quiet, but quiet makes everything feel uneasy, at least for me.That’s one of my biggest problems, really. I’m in my head more than I should be, and that leads to overthinking. Overthinking leads to misunderstanding, which leads to fighting, which ruins the peace. Once the peace is gone and I’m yelling, sometimes the kids catch it and their feelings get stepped on. 

They always forgive me, of course. I’m their dad, and they love me. I want to make sure it stays that way, before I ruin everything by breaking a fragile heart one too many times. 

I would scroll through those TikTok videos everyone’s obsessed with and see just how much parents can mess up their kids. Every other video seems to back that up. I know it’s an algorithm that feeds that content, but still, the sheer amount of video out there tells me there are a lot of people hurt by their parents. I’m one of those parents. My kids just don’t realize it yet.

“Today I’ll be different,” I told myself, “I'll be better. Today will make up for everything.”

My wife got up before me and was already making my birthday breakfast, so I poured her a second cup of coffee and kissed her lips. She smiled and melted my soul. I couldn’t help smiling back.

“Hold it right there - don’t you move a muscle, birthday boy,” she commanded as she pulled out her phone to snap a picture. She always did her best to catch me smiling.

“Perfect,” she said, and winked. Her green eyes, always so beautiful, caught the light of the morning sun. I don’t know what I did to deserve the love of someone like her, someone who loves me despite how often I screw things up, despite the pressure and stress I bring. That’s why today matters so much.

“Kid, I don’t know how you manage to get more syrup on your face than in your mouth, but congratulations little girl, you’re the champion.”
My daughter smiled and laughed, flinging bits of waffle on the table. Usually I’d be grossed out, but not this time. I laughed, she laughed harder, and in a moment the whole kitchen was full of laughter. That was exactly what I needed. The day was starting better than I could’ve hoped for.

I made sure to do the dishes the way my wife prefers; rinsed in the soapy side, then in clean water, then straight into the dishwasher to be more thoroughly cleansed. I told her to take her time getting ready, there was no need to rush. We had all day together, and I didn’t want a single moment to be stressful for any of them.

I’ve been thinking that birthdays shouldn’t really be for me. When I’m gone, the kids will remember the fun they had when they were with me, that’s more important than any present I could ever get.
It hadn’t even reached noon and we were already on the road. I planned a day at the carnival for the kids and a stop or two at the beer garden for my wife. How could she resist a little fizzing gold while the kids played?

“Daddy, please can I get cotton candy?” my son asked in that excited, almost-screaming voice kids got at these kinds of places.

“Of course, whatever you want,” I said, rubbing his messy nest of brown hair.

“Are you sure we can afford all this?” my wife asked, more concerned than I wanted her to be.

“Of course,” I told her. “Besides, I really want today to be amazing for you guys.”
She smiled, and followed the kids to the sugar-covered vendor.

The laughter was perfect, smiles all around and I couldn’t tell you the last time I saw my wife smile that wide. She even snorted once or twice. It was like I said, “perfect.” The day had turned out just the way I wanted. I even made it to the top of that stupid hammer game, you know, the one with the bell on top? It took five tries, but I made it.

After dinner; pizza, of course, three full bellied kids fell asleep in the back seat of my old beat up junker. My wife looked content and maybe still a little buzzed. An almost perfect evening for an almost-perfect family.

With the kids all tucked in, I sat at the table with my wife going through photos from the day. So many smiles caught on a hand sized screen proof of an amazing day that could last forever. We laughed all over again, sipping wine from plastic cups, and it wasn’t long before I was tucking her in as well.

“Thank you, honey,” she said sleepily. “I don’t know what got into you today, but it was the best.”

Her smile, sweet and tender, was the perfect end to a perfect day. It was exactly what I had needed and even more importantly, exactly what they had needed.

As I sat at the kitchen table alone, staring at a blank sheet of paper and searching for words, I decided not to write a thing. I had nothing left to say.

I’ve never been good at giving gifts, or getting gifts for that matter. This year I decided I didn’t want one. Instead, I wanted to give them the perfect one.

I remember a few weeks ago, I had a rough day at work. I got home and the kids were running around in that wild, uncontrollable way kids do. My wife was at the table with tears in her eyes, looking at bills we still couldn’t afford to pay.
“Babe?” I asked. “Is there anything you need me to handle?”
“I needed you to handle plenty of things three hours ago,” she said. “I needed your help there hours ago, I’m drowning here. I work too, you know.”

I did know. I tried to be home, tried to help. But, in the grand scheme of things, I’ve always been that guy who tries his best and still falls short. I don’t mean to make others miserable, but it’s what I do so effortlessly.

That’s why the day was so important to get right. And you know what? For once, I was successful.
That night, I tried to explain how I felt, that I was doing the best I could. I asked what she needed from me.

“Silence,” she said. “Between the kids and work and bills, and then you come home, confused about why I’m stressed, it just makes it worse. I just need silence, babe. A little bit of quiet.”

This morning I made my wife breakfast in bed and left it with a note telling her to sleep in and enjoy the rest. I ended it with an I love you and a little heart drawing.

I took the kids to get donuts for breakfast. Maybe too much sugar for a school day, but they deserved the best. I kissed them before dropping them in line, holding my hugs longer than I normally would.

In the silence of my garage, I dug out an old lockbox I kept beneath the workbench. The lock had rusted, so I had to use some force to break it loose. When I finally got it open, I made sure all the contents were there. Satisfied, I closed it but left the lock undone.

My wife still slept, and the house was perfectly quiet. Exactly what she needed. I kissed her one last time and headed for the door. Before pulling out, I left my phone and wallet minus a family photo on the counter.

I drove through the neighborhood and past the houses until the buildings thinned and the trees thickened in different hues of green and yellow. I kept going until the road turned to dirt and gravel, until it eventually came to a small pull-off beside the lake.

I grabbed my box and sat in the front seat, windows down so I could feel the cool air on my skin. I knew it was best to leave everything unwritten and let yesterday speak for itself. 

I opened the box and stared as my heart raced.
For a moment, I almost turned the key and went home. But then I remembered this is what they needed from me. Everything had led to this moment.

I looked at the small family photo I kept in my wallet, torn at the edges. I smiled, thinking of their laughter, their smiles, her voice.

The perfect gift, I thought. Something that would never break, never disappoint. I took a deep breath and closed my eyes.

“Happy birthday,” I whispered. Then I made sure they’d never hear the noise that drowns them again.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/s/N3drjdHoJ4): **October 10, 2025**

I’m honestly kind of freaking out right now.

For context: I’m a teen mom to my 7 month old daughter. I recently started nannying again because I needed the income, and I took a job that wasn’t ideal. two kids in my neighborhood for $16/hr. I used to study child health and development in college before I dropped out to raise my daughter, and I’ve got about a year and a half of nannying experience.

I found this family on Care.com, and looking back.there were so many red flags.

She had no profile picture, She refused a phone interview, saying she “only does in-person” because she can “tell character better that way.”, She used military time for everything (so I assumed she was ex-military she’s not)., and She insisted on meeting at a school, not a coffee shop or anywhere public I suggested.

She was 15 minutes late and showed up in short shorts, no bra, slippers, and high socks. Not exactly the strict, polished person I expected based on her tone over text.

She had three kids 6F, 4F, and almost 2M. The interview actually went okay, and because she lived nearby, I accepted the job on the spot. She mentioned paying me as a 1099 contractor (which is illegal for household employees in my state), so I told her she’d either need to do under the table cash or a proper W-2. She chose cash but refused to sign a contract because she “didn’t want paper trails.” Another red flag I should’ve listened to.

During the interview, I specifically said no secret nanny cams. She told me she only had two cameras both in her kids’ rooms. Which I was completely fine with.

But then weird comments started happening.

\• One day, I served the kids some fruit that was already cut up in the fridge. Later, she mentioned “you forgot to wash it”

\• Another time, she brought up a snack I had packed for my daughter one I never left at her house.

\• She mentioned me wiping down her counters with a reusable towel something she couldn’t have known unless she was watching me.

\• She also somehow knew I use voice-to-text because of my dyslexia… something I never told her.

At that point, I assumed there was a hidden camera or mic somewhere. which was super offputting, considering she knew I breast-fed my daughter, and had specifically asked if there was any cameras.

The vibe in general was off. She made really degrading comments, like saying she doesn’t understand why anyone would go to college for child development and strictly referring to me as a babysitter . She was dismissive, controlling, and constantly added new chores on top of childcare to the point that I could barely focus on the kids. Her daughter would also often say some weird and concerning things for example “ my mom’s gonna be mad, but it’s okay because she won’t be mad at me”, “the floors are really dirty. You need to sweep them.” and one time she went on a minute, tangent about silly, forgetful people who always forget everything after I left my lunchbox at their house overnight along with this and some other stuff she said I just assumed she was repeating stuff her mother had said.

But today was the breaking point.

My daughter wasn’t feeling well, so she wanted to be held most of the day. The two-year-old knocked over a set of picture frames on himself (the house was not at all child friendly). The 4-year-old had multiple meltdowns, and when I tried to calm her, she started kicking and hitting me. I let the mom know I’d need to leave early, and she agreed as long as both kids were down for a nap first.

While I was feeding my daughter before leaving, I noticed the Alexa was flashing green every time I spoke. I Googled it and learned that means there’s a drop in basically, someone is listening in.

That’s when I started looking around the room. And sure enough.

I found a hidden camera tucked inside an open purse.

Pointed directly at the chair where I breastfeed my daughter.

I froze. My stomach dropped. I grabbed my baby, packed up our stuff, and left without unloading the dishwasher.

A few hours later, she sent me a long text rant about “clarifying expectations.” Basically, she wanted me to be a maid, not a nanny. all while watching three kids.

After talking to my husband, I’ve decided I’m quitting immediately. I’m still shaken that someone recorded me feeding my baby without consent.

I’ll update once I officially quit and send her my message but seriously. trust your gut .

**OOP needs to report the mother to the police immediately if she's a minor**

**Additional Information from OOP on her background and the family she was working for**

> **OOP:** I am 19. I graduated high school early starting college when I was 17 got married when I was 18. the children were not unattended The mother works from home but is upstairs but she does have two cameras in each of the children’s rooms. I did not take any pictures because my mangle was to get out of there. I don’t know how to leave an update, but I will write one tomorrow.

**Commenter 1:** Holy shit OP, that's absolutely disgusting and definitely illegal in most places. Recording someone breastfeeding without consent is a serious crime - like sexual exploitation level serious. Document everything you can remember and definitely file that police report ASAP

The fact that she was so sketchy about paper trails makes way more sense now... she knew exactly what she was doing

**Commenter 2:** Okay I’m sorry but I keep getting hung up on the fact that these children (all under 6) would be home alone after you leave (even if you put them down for a nap first) especially after you mentioned that the house is not at all child friendly… but yeah her recording you without your consent is unhinged and you should report it

**Commenter 3:** I would report to the police and care.com. It’s unbelievable that not only would she be recording you like a weirdo, but also using you as a maid when you were hired to take care of the kids. But for real, how do you know she’s not selling videos of you?? She sounds off the rails!

**Commenter 4:** Two words: Police report.

&nbsp;

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/s/2D2leE9XF9): **October 11, 2025**

UPDATE: I found a hidden camera pointed at where I breastfeed my baby

I forgot to mention in my last post that I unplugged both the camera and the Alexa before I left that day. Between that and my mom (who’s a therapist and have talked to her before) strongly believing she is a narcissist, I decided I will not be returning.

My mom actually helped me write a text to keep things calm and avoid any retaliation the nanny mom knows where I live, so we wanted to be careful with how I worded it. Here’s what I sent her:

“Thank you for sharing your concerns. Today was definitely a rough one with sick kids, lack of sleep, and a lot of challenging behaviors. After reflecting, I feel that with the expectations and the different ages, this position isn’t the best fit for me. For safety reasons, I believe it would be better for you to find someone else. 2M knocking down the picture frames today because I was preoccupied with 4F and my daughter has really shown me that it would be best for me to step away immediately for everybody’s safety.”

She replied with:

“Okay wow that was pretty unexpected. I disagree with the imminent safety concern, especially being that he is 20 months and didn’t do it with malicious intent but I respect your decision. I will calculate your time and pay you accordingly.” (my mom said this is a typical response of a narcissist, taking her child “faults” as her own.)

I just replied “thank you”, and she did end up paying me — but only about one-third of what I was owed.

Here’s the message she sent with the payment:

“Paid. 30 minutes removed for unfulfilled obligations that I had to tend during my lunch today. And 6 hours removed for previous overpayment of miscalculated hours. Thank you for your time with us.”

The “unfulfilled obligations” she’s talking about? Dishes I had already cleaned but didn’t put away (from the night before, when I wasn’t even working) and not sweeping the floors.

Also, looking back, I feel like there was a lot of mind games should play with me through stuff she heard and saw, including her “ miscalculating the hours” she randomly started counting my five hours days as six hours and would constantly mention it and write it on my clock in sheet. I don’t know if she was testing me just feels odd. she would also constantly repeat that she was a good person and had good morals. even sometimes going as far as repeating, she’s a good person three times in the same conversation.

I haven’t filed the police report, but I also don’t have any photos. I’ve reported her to care.com. She already has a post up I’m planning to check in occasionally to see if it’s taken down and she hired somebody else they sort of live in my neighborhood so maybe I’ll be able to catch the nanny on a walk and give her a heads up. they also had a nanny before me that left abrupt as well.

A few people pointed out in my last post that I was being severely underpaid your right. I’ve already started looking for other nanny positions and have been offered $22–$25/hr, which just confirms how much I was being taken advantage of.

Edit : it has been about four days I mentioned I had found her on care.com. I saw a post up now she’s offering $15 to $18 an hour the $18 an hour is a lie. I doubted she’d find anyone in that price range but sure enough her post is taken down. I looked in her account still up so I assume she found a new nanny. I took the long way to work and drove by her house and sure enough a mom of one or two kids was standing outside holding their baby. Can’t help to think she’s trying to do this to another mother. I’m afraid to say anything to this Mom because what if it’s her family once again my mom is practically diagnosed her as a narcissist and I’m terrified of what she would do given she knows where I live.

**Additional Information from OOP in comments**

> **OOP:** I had left a toy at their house and they left it by my mailbox just a little bit odd

**Relevant / Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I didn't understand how you left (first post)--weren't you watching children? Did you leave them alone in the house? I'm not being negative--I would be very angry to be on an unknown camera even if I wasn't breastfeeding!

> **OOP:** No the mother worked upstairs from home

**OOP should post the information on nextdoor and other nannying sites**

> **OOP:** I have thought about this. I posted it in a local nanny’s group just to give people a heads up.

**Commenter 2:** Report everything to care.com, the camera and the shorting you on pay.

**Commenter 3:** Tell her that she either pays you everything you’re owed or you’ll sue her for failing to pay you properly AND videoing you. She violated the law by paying you not as an employee.

**Commenter 4:** I understand why you're reluctant to file a police report, especially since you don't have any evidence, but I really really really urge you to call CPS and tell them about secretly being filmed while breastfeeding. That's literally sexual exploitation (in fact, a good reason to just file the report anyway, whether you have concrete evidence or not, is that the video is likely to end up posted online, for profit or otherwise). This woman is a sexual predator. That doesn't necessarily mean that she's a direct danger to her children, but I think a person who secretly records a baby being breastfed might also be doing similar things with the kids. Even if the kids aren't being sexually exploited, the fact remains that their mother is a sexual predator. If you don't call CPS, you'll spend the rest of your life wondering if those children are safe.

Aaaaand having said all that, I feel even more certain that you need to talk to the police. She didn't just record you, she recorded your baby! There's a certain kind of predator out there who fetishizes breastfeeding specifically because it involves a child. If someone secretly recorded my child--in any setting--I'd go scorched earth. You are not taking this seriously enough.

My [26F] fiancé’s [28M] ex-wife [28F] has cancer. He's moved in with her and postponed our wedding.

Apologies for length. 

""Max"" and I dated for two years and have been engaged for 9 months, with the wedding date set for early January. We have a healthy, honest relationship, and I've never had any reason to doubt him. 

He and ""Caroline"" were high school sweethearts who married very young (They were both twenty-two, right out of college). They divorced after two years. Max told me that they got married too quickly and didn't realise how different their relationship would be in the ""real world,"" i.e. when they were both working full-time jobs and struggling to pay the rent. They split up on good terms, but didn't keep in touch. He remained in our home city, while she pursued a modelling career and began travelling extensively. 

Three months ago, Caroline contacted Max over Facebook out of the blue, saying she was in town and wanted to meet for coffee. He agreed. Over coffee, she told him that she had recently been diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer. Her odds of survival were low, but she was determined to fight it through surgery and chemo. She said that all she wanted was for Max to be by her side throughout her treatment. 

Caroline's parents died shortly after she married Max. She has no siblings and the rest of her family lives overseas. She described Max as the closest thing to family she has left. 

I absolutely sympathise with Caroline. The next day Max had her over to our apartment and she was completely lovely, clearly trying very hard to be optimistic even in the face of her life potentially ending before she turns 30. I feel terrible for her and for the situation that she's in, and I fully supported Max being there for her. 

Her first surgery was later that month. Max flew across the country (we live on the east coast, she's on the west) and checked into a hotel a few minutes from her apartment. He's a writer, so working from his laptop is no issue. We spoke on the phone or on Skype almost every day for the two weeks he was over there. 

Caroline had her surgery at the beginning of June. Unfortunately, it was not entirely successful. Her doctors moved to the next method, chemo. 

Max came home after her surgery to tell me this. He explained that Caroline's treatment plan was set to begin in July and end in late January. It would be an incredibly difficult time period for her, and she wanted him with her at all times. 

We can't afford to pay for a hotel until January, so he moved into her apartment, sleeping on her sofa. He's been there for the past month and we continue to Skype, though only a couple times a week now. When we spoke yesterday, Max gently told me that based on Caroline's condition, he wouldn't feel right leaving her so close to the end of her treatment. He'd like for us to postpone the wedding until February, at the very least, so that he can stay with her until her treatment is over. 

I'm so conflicted. I feel awful for resenting Caroline at all - she has cancer! She's suffering immensely. But the resentment is still there. I resent her for needing Max constantly holding her hand, as though she has absolutely no friends of her own. I resent Max, too, for agreeing to this situation. We won't be seeing each other in person for months now, on top of our wedding being postponed. 

I don't know what to do. I have no idea how I'm supposed to feel. Right now I'm just full of anger and guilt, and I don't know how to explain it to anyone else in my life.  
   
**tl;dr: Fiance has moved in with his ex-wife to support her during chemo, postponing our wedding as a result. Am I wrong to feel resentful? Is there a better way of handling this?**

**Edit**: Everyone seems to be in agreement that this is a completely inappropriate (if incredibly sad) situation that Max isn't handling very well. I'll speak to him either tonight or tomorrow, whenever we Skype next, and tell him in no uncertain terms that I want him to come home. From there, we can decide what to do, since I don't want to leave Caroline high and dry. But him living there until February is out of the question.  

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** You have the right to resent Max, he picked his ex-wife over his fiance.

He may 'feel' like he has a responsibility to her but he has a responsibility to his future wife. He is asking you to put your life on hold for his ex-wife.

You absolutely have the right to feel angry about this.

Can you see yourself marrying him after this?

> **OOP:** Honestly, I don't know. Part of me feels like I should admire him, as in ""Oh, look at how selfless he's being for her."" But the other part is thinking, ""But what about me?""
> 
> I want him to come home. But am I really going to demand that he leave his dying ex-wife alone?
> 
> Before he left, he said, ""We've got our whole lives to spend together. She might only have a year.""

**Commenter 2:** He's intending on living with his ex until February?

And you are to do what? Just wait?

No, your resentment and discomfort is not wrong.

I feel intense sympathy for her, for your partner, absolutely. Death is a terrifying cold thing.

But he's supposed to be with you. It was not her right to ask him to be with her as a husband is through this horror.

(Did she ask you?)

My fear is...okay, so February comes, her chemo's done, now she's weak and miserable from chemo. Is he going to leave her then, feeling like that?

He should not have asked you over Skype. He should have been there in person.

When is the next time you are supposed to see him?

> **OOP:** We're not in a bad place financially, but we just couldn't afford a plane ticket every month. We've been trying to save up to buy a house after the wedding, not to mention the cost of the wedding itself.
> 
> So to answer your question: End of January or early February. That's when I'll be seeing him in person, according to his plan.
>> 
>> **Commenter 2:** So...just before the wedding? He expects to spend all this time away from you and then just marry you, without you getting any warming-up time to get to remember what it's like to be close to him? Without him getting any cooling down time after having lived like a husband with this other woman for most of a year?
>> 
>> That would be entirely unacceptable to me.
>> 
>> OP, I can't figure out a way to phrase this delicately, so I hope that you will forgive me my bluntness.
>> 
>> If this relationship ends, are you going to be financially ok? The emotional stuff is one thing (this has to be incredibly difficult, and I admire your composure!) but just in terms of strictly physical, if he says ""I'm old enough to love her the way I wanted to when we were younger,"" and give up on marrying you, are you going to be able to make it?
>> 
>> I hope that you're saving something aside for yourself. Something not in the joint account, if there is one.
>>> 
>>> **OOP:** Trust me, I'm feeling far from composed right now. But thank you.
>>> 
>>> If we're looking at the absolute worst case scenario - the relationship ending - then the money that we've saved for the wedding and the house could be split between us. That's the only money we've got in a joint account right now. Otherwise, we keep individual accounts. So I should have enough to remain on my feet if I end up on my own.
>>> 
>>> I really hope it doesn't come to that.

**Commenter 3:** I feel horribly crass saying this, but I can't imagine them living together, as former lovers, near the possible end of her life, and them not sleeping together at some point. Admittedly, she'll be in an awful physical state, but it's such an emotionally-charged situation that it's highly likely. It might be a good idea to schedule a couple sessions with an experienced relationship and grief counselor because it's an unusual problem, and if handled inappropriately it could end your relationship. EDIT: changed 'marriage' to 'relationship'

> **OOP:** I'd be lying if I said I hadn't thought that. But I hated myself for even considering it. Max has never given me a reason to doubt him, and Caroline's intentions seemed innocent.
> 
> But I have no idea what state she's in now. The only time I met her was back when she visited our apartment.

**Commenter 4:** I think all of you painting Caroline as if she did something wrong are stupid. Max deserves 100% of the blame. Caroline is allowed to ask whoever she wants whatever she wants to ask them.

Max is allowed to say ""no, ex-wife, I won't leave my wife-to-be for you, not now, not ever"", and not face any judgement, because what an absurd thing that is to do.

OP, I don't know how you can possibly recover from this one. You are not selfish to leave this relationship. You are not selfish to tell him he comes home right now or it's over. You're not selfish to resent him or her for what they've put on you, but you should make sure you understand that HE is 100% to blame for this. He, at every moment along this path, should've taken a look around and realized he was engaged to you, not her, and it is not his fault that she has no one closer than him.

Also, he's literally living with his ex-wife. Can you imagine any circumstance where a guy leaves his fiancee to live with his ex-wife and they aren't, at the very least, cuddling and extremely emotionally intimate?

I'd be done with him, if I was you, what an obscenely selfish man.

> **OOP:** ... Wow. I needed to read that.
> 
> You're right. Seeing so many people in agreement - that Max and Caroline (though mostly Max) are being selfish - has decided me.
> 
> I'll speak to him tonight or tomorrow and give an ultimatum. Either he comes home, or we need to rethink our relationship.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/LoPMv9nXAV): **August 25, 2015 (next day)** 

[Update] My [26F] fiancé’s [28M] ex-wife [28F] has cancer. He's moved in with her and postponed our wedding.

[Original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3i958y/my_26f_fiances_28m_exwife_28f_has_cancer_hes/)

First off, thank you all so much for your advice and words of support. I?m sorry that I couldn?t reply to every comment, reply, or PM that I got, but I woke up to a locked post and over 100 unread messages. I promise, I did read through every one of them. Each perspective was incredibly helpful and made me look at the situation in a completely different way. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. 

I spoke to Max this morning. I told him that as terrible as I feel for Caroline, I don't want him living over there until February. I suggested that we brainstorm some sort of schedule that allowed him to continue visiting her, even postponing our honeymoon and using that money to fund his plane tickets. Several commenters brought up her moving over here for treatment, so I mentioned that as well, offering up our spare bedroom. I emphasised that I didn't fault him for wanting to help an old loved one in what could be her final days, but that I couldn't help but feel marginalised, especially so close to our wedding. 

Max didn't speak very much, just listened while I rambled on. When I couldn't think of anything else to add, I asked him to please say something. 

So he told me the truth: Caroline was never stage 4. She was stage 2. 

He assured me that the rest of his story is true. Caroline asking him to be with her, the initial surgery being unsuccessful, her chemo treatment plan, etc. But apparently her chances of survival are *far* greater than he led me to believe. 

Max said he lied because he felt it was the only way I could understand his need to be with her. He thought that if her situation seemed less dire than literal life-or-death, I wouldn't agree to him essentially moving across the country for her. 

He admitted to telling her that our wedding had been postponed to next August, giving her the impression that him being away until February would be no problem. He has also been the one insisting on remaining by her side. After her surgery, she had given him permission to return home, saying that it wouldn't be fair to pressure him into living with her throughout her entire chemo treatment, as much as she would have liked him there. He refused to leave. He told her that I supported this decision fully. 

Max swears that he's not in love with her still, but I just can't believe that. He lied to my face. Before she visited our apartment back in May, he warned me not to mention her being stage 4 as she was still ""extremely sensitive about it.""  And I completely bought into that lie. I trusted him. 

He put his past with her over his future with me. I'll be spending the next few months apartment hunting and cancelling wedding plans. 

Thank you all for your kind words. 

**tl;dr: Confronted fiance. He misrepresented his ex-wife’s illness so that he could spend time with her. It's over.**

*Edit:* I'm blown away by the outpouring of support I'm receiving. I wish I could respond to each of you individually. Thank you so, so much. This is a wonderful community, and I truly appreciate all of your thoughts. 

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Oh my God, i am so sorry. What a turd. You on the other hand, handled this beautifully.

Please lean on the people close to you in this time. Or lean on us! I know you don't think it right now, but you're going to be ok.

Many internet hugs being sent your way.

> **OOP:** Thank you. I just feel like such an idiot. All this time, and I never once questioned his story. I never even saw Caroline - he told me that she was too embarrassed by her appearance to join in on our Skype calls. I just took him at his word.

**How did Max take the breakup?**

> **OOP:** He kept apologising to me, not very sincerely. He just sounded tired, and when I said that I'd be moving out as soon as possible he replied, ""That's probably for the best."" The one thing he asked for was my ring, which I agreed to mail to Caroline's address.
> 
> I'm realising that he checked out of this relationship a while ago.

**What about the ring? Is it an heirloom? Does OOP need to return that?**

> **OOP:** No, it's not an heirloom. We picked it out together.
> 
> I couldn't sell it. Anything I bought with that money, I'd never be able to look at without thinking of him. I'm more than happy to return the ring to him because it's a no-strings-attached way of getting it out of my life. Hopefully, it can be a nice reminder to him of me and why our relationship ended.

**OOP can leave the ring on that counter and let Max deal with it**

> **OOP:** I might send it addressed to Caroline and include a note explaining to her why things ended between me and Max. Many people here are saying that she deserves to know the truth, since his lies were crafted around her illness.
>> 
>> **Commenter 2:** This is a very good idea, but I would be concerned about Max intercepting it and making sure she never sees it.
>>> 
>>> **OOP:** Good point. I could always ask a friend of mine to send it on my behalf, so that it won't be our apartment on the return address.
>>> 
>>> But this is probably wishful thinking. I should just leave it on the counter and move on.

**OOP's plans now that she has end her engagement to Max**

> **OOP:** I intend to go no contact with him, but I might send Caroline some sort of note. She's been completely innocent throughout all of this and she deserves to know the truth, which I doubt he's told her.

I’d wake up early and watch the sunrise from the lake,
Sip my coffee on the water as light kisses the earth,
feel my soul come alive for the last time.

I wouldn’t write letters,
I wouldn’t share these moments,
I’d call those I love and pray they don’t answer,
So I can tell them how much I love them,
and they can hold that forever.

If today was my last day,
I’d lay in the park and feel the earth,
I’d count the leaves one last time,
I’d let my mind follow the curves of the clouds,
My mind would wander to climbing the trees,
But I wouldn’t do it,
For it’s my last day & I need it to last.

I wouldn’t reach out to friends,
I wouldn’t change their memory of me,
I’d exist in the truest form to myself,
So I can leave this earth as my own best friend, finally.

If today was my last day,
I’d sit at a cafe and order 3 lattes,
I’d watch the world dance around me,
I’d romanticize the couple in the corner, giggling to each other,
Whispering in light tones,
Dreaming of the loves I’d had and ran from.

I wouldn’t reach out,
I wouldn’t curse anyone with that memory,
The “what if I could’ve stopped this,”
For this decision was my own to hold.

If today was my last day,
I’d remember everyone I’ve ever loved,
I’d paint their memories among the golden larches in my mind,
In the purples and pinks of a mountaintop sunset,
I’d carry their love with me into the unknown.

But today’s not my last day,
So I’ll continue to live with the love I hold,
The friendships I hold so close,
I’ll continue climbing trees and cheering on everyone that exists,
I’ll hold those who haven’t been held,
I’ll be the ear to all but myself.

I’ll be the love I so desperately want to see,
Wash across this battle worn planet,
And hope that someday,
Just maybe,
I’ll make a difference,
Until my last day.",1,1760759771.0,PoetryWritingClub,1,1.0,False

I was tired of working in the US so I decided to move to Ecuador to work online, but when I got here I didn't feel like applying for remote jobs or working 8 hours a day so I haven't really done that.

I live with a local family in Ambato, my life is about 150/month. Rent is 80, I mostly eat rice and potatoes and don't spend money on much else. Luckily I have a really nice Bulgarian classical guitar and a Kobo for reading.

I had posted a while ago in [r/digitalnomad](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/) but I guess some of them think I don't qualify as that, I was at $800 for a while but now I'm down to like $450....but before you freak out, that's still like 3-4 months at my current burn rate, and I get fined and/or banned if I leave Ecuador which would suck!

Most days start slow, I have breakfast with the family, make some coffee by holding a filter over a coffee mug and pouring the water over it (no money for coffee machine), lately I've been reading some French Lit like Michaeux's Plume or Mount Analogue by Daumal. After that I spend a few hours playing classical guitar (Villa-Lobos and Bach), go for a walk to the market and cook dinner, do some people watching and then go to bed.

The family recently asked me if I was going to work but I just told them I had plenty of savings, which is partially true, so yeah.

It's my first time renting an airbnb where the host \[also M, looks to be in his 30s\] is staying on-site - it's a 2 bedroom apartment where I'll get the spare room.

 I wanted to ask what the etiquette is in shared spaces? His rules say it's a shared bathroom, no cooking in the kitchen but welcome to use it for tea/coffee. And I messaged him to check if I can have breakfast in the kitchen and he said that's fine and that ""it's a chill house"".

Specifically wondering:

* I wake up pretty early - if I'm up before my host is awake, should I be tiptoeing around if I need to use the kitchen/bathroom?
* Should I be like telling him when I'm leaving/when I'll be home? Assuming I'll have a key as normal.
* What's etiquette like for dress code in shared spaces? e.g. walking from the shower to my room, do I need to get fully dressed in the bathroom or can I just walk out in a towel to get to my room? Given it's pretty close to the beach, do I need to e.g. put on a shirt if I'm just chilling at home / if I just walk to the kitchen for a coffee, if it's hot or if I've just returned from the beach?",1,1760759379.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

Just wanted to introduce myself, I'm an expat, American, 26 living in Ecuador. I was tired of working in the US so I decided to move to Ecuador to work online, but when I got here I didn't feel like applying for remote jobs or working 8 hours a day so I haven't really done that.

I live with a local family in Ambato, my life is about 150/month. Rent is 80, I mostly eat rice and potatoes and don't spend money on much else. Luckily I have a really nice Bulgarian classical guitar and a Kobo for reading.

I had posted a while ago in r/digitalnomad but I guess some of them think I don't qualify as that, I was at $800 for a while but now I'm down to like $450....but before you freak out, that's still like 3-4 months at my current burn rate, and I get fined and/or banned if I leave Ecuador which would suck!

Most days start slow, I have breakfast with the family, make some coffee by holding a filter over a coffee mug and pouring the water over it (no money for coffee machine), lately I've been reading some French Lit like Michaeux's Plume or Mount Analogue by Daumal. After that I spend a few hours playing classical guitar (Villa-Lobos and Bach), go for a walk to the market and cook dinner, do some people watching and then go to bed.

The family recently asked me if I was going to work but I just told them I had plenty of savings, which is partially true, so yeah.

1o9lnun,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1o9lnun/aio_i_dont_know_if_my_buss_driver_is_a_creep_or/,AIO? I don't know if my buss driver is a creep or just a friendly old guy.,"I (22F) stay in a student housing apartment block and they offer shuttle services to take us too and from the university campus. The shuttles come round every half an hour and the drive is only about 10 minutes long so students will often take the shuttle multiple times a day.

I am a very bubbly person who will talk to everyone. I especially like to talk to people who are often overlooked and unappreciated by others (for example, if I see anyone cleaning a public bathroom I will always stop to thank them for their work) so from day 1 of taking the shuttle I started making conversation with the driver (I dont know his exact age but I would guess 60s to 70s).

Throughout the year we became good acquaintance with each other and shared many stories. Sometimes it would be deep (I tend to overshare and I've heard it's common with people with ADHD). I shared about how my boyfriend was pronounced dead last year (I can't bring myself to make the confirming statement ""passed away"" and still pray constantly that he is still somehow alive) and my depression around it, I even shared when dark thoughts of ending it occurred, but always reassured him that I would never take that step. He shared with me stories around his wife's passing a few years ago and how he misses her but is glad he has his daughter and granddaughter around. The majority of the times our conversations would range from our life stories, what's going on with our families, plans for the week etc, to the current state of the world, technological and medical advancements and politics (my least favourite topic). He would show me videos of his granddaughter's dance recitals and once told me I remind him of his daughter because we are both beautiful. He would always compliment me on my aura, personality and how positive and hopeful I am. I became used to him saying he missed me over the weekend or if there had been a few days that I didn't take the shuttle, and that he will miss me next year when I move out of the apartments.

This all lead me to believe that we had a sweet cross generational friendship. But then his comments started to feel a bit off.

My doubts all started when he said ""I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but if I may say, you are very beautiful"". This felt weird to me because he has called me beautiful and pretty before, but had never added the 'don't take this the wrong way' part. Up until then I wasn't even aware that there was another way this compliment from him could be taken. A day or two later he said we should have lunch or coffee sometime and chat. Then he asked me if I had ever been to ""The hidden Valley"" (Don't worry, I checked and it is a real place). I told him I hadn't and he went on to describe that to get there you take this long  dirt side road along the mountain and into the woods...
(At this point I stopped listening and my mind went to all the true crime I consume daily, but I didn't think he would do anything, it was moreso a thought of ""haha, this sounds like how someone else could be attacked by a different person""). I don't know if he was hinting that that was the place we should go for lunch or if he just moved onto a different topic, so I responded with, ""That sounds so beautiful, I should take my parents there sometime""

I asked some of my friends their opinion and they thought I was overreacting until I told them the Hidden Valley thing and then they started doubting too. We were all joking around a bit and came to the conclusion that he is just a sweet and friendly old man.

I talked to another friend of mine about this yesterday and he said the shuttle driver is a creep.

But since then, the little comments started to feel a bit weird. We would still have all of our normal conversations, but when he would say I look nice today or that he missed me, it would sit funny in my mind.

Today (technically yesterday, but I haven't slept so in my mind it's still today) I wanted to boost my mood so I dressed up nicely, but not provocatively (high-waisted shorts and a white crop top which showed less than a cm of my waist). When he saw me he mouthed the word ""WOW"". Then after he dropped me off and we said our goodbyes he said something under his breath that I could not hear. When I said ""Sorry, what was that? I couldn't hear"", he brushed it off and said ""Never mind, have a nice day.""
After taking me back on the last trip of the day I said he must enjoy his weekend and he said: ""I'm bringing myself to go to the beach this weekend. I'll be thinking of you.""
That surprised me to say the least, but I just smiled, said goodbye and left.

Since then that comment has been plaguing my mind. What did he mean by ""I'll be thinking of you""? Why would he be thinking of me when he's at the beach?
I just smiled, said goodbye and left.

I know what to do: carry on as normal, but I don't know what to think.
Through all of these comments I've always politely said thank you and changed the topic or left.

If he makes plans to go out for lunch at a public place should I go? I know he's not dangerous, but it still feels awkward. 

Reddit, please help.
Is this man looking for something more than frienship, is he dodgy, or am I overreacting when in reality he is just a sweet guy who values our friendship.




P.S. Sorry for the long post. I doubt anyone will read this post, but if you do, please don't try and find out who this guy is and harass him. He is a good, hard working man and doesn't deserve any hate.",3,1760759086.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

Looking to freshen up our family room.,"For context we are in a small rental condo, so changes would have to be renter friendly (no wallpaper, paint etc) we have a toddler and a baby at home so the open space is filled during the day with toys etc so can’t have a coffee table. We don’t watch our tv that often but there is nowhere else for it to go. I don’t love the couch but it was expensive and until we move I really don’t want to deal with getting rid of it. I am trying to not put any more holes in the walls as our landlord doesn’t love the idea but I feel like picture holes is fine. 

I want this space to feel warm and cozy but also relaxing (not too much clutter). 

I am in search for a new patterned rug that is longer so the dresser can sit fully on it and something that adds more colour to the space, thinking browns, sage greens, ivory, rust, grey. Maybe something a tad darker to ground the space since everything is light including the floors. The distance from the dresser to the couch is just under 6ft. So I was thinking an 8x10 rug. 

I just got family portraits done and am open to putting art on the walls I’m just unsure if it would look too crowded, (I don’t love the art gallery wall look)

1o9lhb7,https://i.redd.it/ml3t1ppzisvf1.jpeg,Will refusing to provide Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles undermine America's global leadership role? Click to Read,"""U.S. might withhold Tomahawk missiles from Ukraine.” My coffee went cold as I just sat there thinking how, once again, America’s choices ripple far beyond its borders. Countries watch, allies wait, and rivals well, they smirk.

It’s not just about weapons. It’s about trust.  

Back in 2014, when Russia first entered Crimea, I was a student writing essays about deterrence and credibility. Sounds dramatic, but those words suddenly feel painfully real in 2025. The Tomahawk isn’t just a missile it’s symbolism wrapped in steel. It says America still defends freedom, even when it’s messy or inconvenient. So, if Washington now hesitates, nations like Poland or the Baltics might start wondering who’s next to doubt our commitment? And honestly, that’s the scary part. Because once that doubt creeps in, alliances fracture not with a bang, but with quiet hesitation over dinner tables at NATO summits. I can almost imagine those uneasy smiles half reassurance, half suspicion.

Still, there’s another side. People argue America’s already spent billions why send more? I get that. Voters at home are tired, and inflation hasn’t made life easier. Maybe it’s time others carried some weight too.  

But here’s the catch it’s about perception. Power, these days, isn’t just strength; it’s confidence. If America steps back now, China and Russia will fill that silence faster than you can refresh a Twitter feed. And trust me, the narrative will shift “The U.S. no longer leads.” That’s not just strategy; it’s psychology.

Sometimes I think foreign policy’s like playing chess in fog. You make your move, but the world reads your face, not your board.  

And right now, the face America shows will decide whether it still leads or simply watches history unfold from the sidelines.

1o9lh6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1o9lh6c/welp/,Welp....,"Hey. Hi. Hello. Here I am, here again, writing, apparently. In a shockingly calm headspace, even if my heart feels torn into pieces, and for more reasons than just one. 

I guess I'll share those reasons, and yet I'll save the cringiest one that makes me feel embarrassed and stupid for last. 

First. Today was... good. Not as emotional as I expected, but I guess still emotional, in a way. I actually haven't really... *cried* cried at all. Which is really shocking. I've been at the point where when I get too emotional sometimes I just... will the feelings away. It's not a full-proof plan, but somehow you'd be surprised at how well it works. I should probably not do that. But I actually do not know how to cry. 

It was.... overwhelming to think about. So I just tried really hard not to, even though I kept being reminded. I now take back everything I have ever said, and am fully on your side about the lack of a party. Because EEK. I love my mentor and I love the kids, but it was a LOT. Even a little would feel like a lot. But like, this?! Oh my god. I was happy in some ways, but also I really wanted to take a page out of your book and cry. 

Because it's nice to be celebrated, but somehow in some ways it's... not? It's just like.... weird, and overwhelming to have people care so much. And then to have to smile and not cry and gave a good time. And the fact that my mentor really spent money on this. It's amazing and I feel so loved but I also feel..... embarrassed? Guilty? I don't know, and I know I shouldn't.... God, is that how you feel?? 

Like, a student wanted to be in charge, so she even gave the mini speech thanking me and it was so put together and so sweet and then she handed me the gift and I just wanted to break down and cry while I was thanking everyone! I knew it would be overwhelming to begin with, but I was NOT expecting the gift. I was mortified at the time, but I guess at the same time I'm glad to experience it. Nobody's ever done anything for me. I didn't even get birthday parties as a kid. I attempted inviting people over, but nobody showed up for me. I planned my own sweet sixteen, and I almost couldn't believe it when people actually showed up. After my middle school graduation, I cried when my cat destroyed my roses, because I knew that I wouldn't get any until high school graduation. Everyone told me that might not be true, but I was right, and even then I only got them because one of my best friends had multiple bouquets. 

But anyway, it felt... insane. It was an actual WTF moment. But I guess at the same time I was glad to have experienced something like that at least once? It really was beautiful and I was so so grateful. Although I don't know, I'm not sure I'd want that to happen a ton more either. Like, by the end of the day I felt so strange that it almost felt like I was in an alternate reality. Like half of my students that were present in last period rushed up to give me a hug before they left. And I kinda was more affectionate and touchy-feely with kids that I didn't give that to all the time, and I didn't realize how many of them actually liked it. I was really sad about all of our absences though. I'm gonna miss all my kids, but especially the ones I never got to say goodbye to. 

There's two in particular on my mind right now. The girl that kept reaching for my hand. And the boy who sat and had a full conversation with me for the first time yesterday, telling me what it was like when he left Afghanistan. He skipped lunch and just hung out, doing his work and then talking about his favorite video game. I'm heartbroken to leave these kids. Every last one of them.

Don't get me wrong. I know my next placement will be good. I wonder if my mentor ever got to read my whole note. I'm excited I guess, a little nervous, and a lot tired. Maybe I'll try to rest tomorrow, clean up a bit, and I need to try on clothes, then pictures Sunday! I'm so excited, but also kinda scared of that too, because I'm suddenly very self conscious. I also happen to have a humongous pimple on my face, for the first time since I was like 12. 

So after school I had my best friend come over. You know her, F! We enjoyed that special coffee shop near tops. Ugh it was only my second time there, but if I had more money I would be spending it there. The pistachio cake is AMAZING. We walked to my house and yapped for hours. Literally. She came over at like 4:30 and just left half an hour ago. I'm exhausted, but not complaining. It was so nice to catch up. I got to tell her about teaching, and she got to let out all her frustrations. It did turn out to be a counseling session for her. I wish I had more time with her, we need to hang out more because there was just SO much to say, between just missing each other, her boy troubles, and her strained relationship with her mom. I don't have the best insight on those things, but I try. Well, I normally just say that guys are stupid and her mom's a piece of work. 

But I saw a different side of that today. Maybe it's because I was stuck in teacher mode. Her mom has to be EXHAUSTED. She's worked over 12 hours today. And is definitely burnt out. And she's also kinda overprotective and maybe even frustrated because she had to sacrifice a lot because of her disability. That doesn't make it right, but I guess I understand why she hasn't just cut her off or stood up to her. I really hope that things get better for her. I don't agree with her mom on how she acts all the time. But I also don't dislike her or misunderstand her the way I did when she would vent to me as kids. 

Anyway I'm really tired. And I haven't stayed up this late in a while. I'm gonna head to bed. And I will cut down on writing here, although I'm kinda silly. If it were you and you were that bothered, you would've seen my reply. But it's okay that you didn't. You're busy, plus it I guess reminds me what I shouldn't forget. I'm alone. :) I don't mean that in a bad way, either. I guess I don't mind it so much. You know, at one point I think I was very... upset about everything. But now I think that even when things hurt, they aren't bad. They just.... are. 

Anyway, good night! Have a great weekend, and despite my better judgment (again, not in a mean way. But I'm pretty sure you know I don't have a mean bone in my body.) See you next week, lol. <3

Even though it's sad, I appreciate you and the space between us. I'm not sure that's true in every single moment. But I'm sure it will be soon. ",2,1760758481.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

1o9l4pm,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1o9l4pm/my_boss_is_acting_weird/,My boss is acting weird,"Hi,
For the context I joined the company recently on a managerial position. The company is facing huge turnover due to organizational restructuring, multiple RIFs being announced from the very beginning I joined (I didn’t know it’s that bad prior to joining). We were also brought back to office for 5 days in a week without any possibility of working from home. The RTO strangely enough was not communicated anywhere officially…it happened a month ago and the employee handbook is still stating that we are in a hybrid environment and managers can ask you to come to the office on a specific day. 

Since the RTO I have not missed a day until today. Also I was working fully remotely since 2020 in my previous companies and since starting my new job, I have been picking up all the viruses. I am literally sick and fatigued all the time for the past 2 months. I had approximately a week of some onboarding and during that week I already jumped in and started working independently, receiving a lot of positive feedback and delivered big initiatives impacting the whole department and company. The job has been rewarding and I decided to not be too much affected by the organizational uncertainty. I treated it like a challenge. 

But I am very anxious with the way how my manager is acting towards me… today I messaged that I won’t be able to come in as I got sick and I asked if I can stay home and work from home. The response was: I wish you told me before and not at the time you should be in the office. I was shocked. I sent this at 8:55. During 10 years of my career in huge corporations or smaller companies, and start up’s, I never received a response like this. I’m not a shift worker btw, we are in HQ. I had no meetings this day, no launches or critical deadlines. I did not reply to that. Then the second message asked if I have anything critical on my plate and I said no but explained my commitments. Then the following message was ""you should take a sick day, I would prefer you to not work from home, working while sick isn’t fun"". Riiiight so if I had something stressful and pressuring you would allow that? 

Literally two weeks ago my boss allowed my direct peer (a specialist) to work from home as that person admitted that in a text sent to me. Across our entire department people are still working from home. The office is empty on Thursdays and Fridays. I told my boss that it’s important for me to know that the flexibility will be given occasionally when needed and she assured me it will be, unless she sees a pattern of abusing that flexibility. I guess by getting sick I abused her trust. 

Speaking of trust, one day I arrived to work at 9:20 as my pet had an accident. I explained it and she told me that I need to be coming in earlier and that ""trust is earned there not given"" - literally her words, and that she is with the company for 10 years. She arrives the last out of the entire department, often with a Starbucks coffee in her hands. Another time I arrived that time was when there was an accident on the road. Also, people are not coming at 9 sharp, there are many people arriving around 9:30 and there is no rule defined in the handbook. I can understand her preference for being there at 9 sharp, but I am furious with the way how she handled my text message today. She allowed the other coworker to work remotely but denied that for me, and also her response saying I should have told her earlier was very passive aggressive to me. 

Since the comment about trust, I developed anxiety and insomnia during work week because I am worried something will happen that will make me ""late"" again and she will write me up. To anyone responding go to HR - we are HR. Thankfully the team is big and there are still supervisors above my boss. Am I being unreasonable here? I want to continue working there despite the uncertainty of the company but her behavior is giving me so much anxiety it is making me dread the work week. I am also worried she will terminate me either before the end of my probation or during the next RIF. For the context also, since she took over the team, both people that were there before me left…",1,1760757372.0,jobs,8,1.0,False

1o9l45a,https://i.redd.it/fr634fjifsvf1.jpeg,Does OpenAI's divergence from the Tech Council of Australia indicate that AI companies could be on a collision course with governments in the future? Click to Read,"It’s strange, you know, watching a tech giant like OpenAI quietly step away from the Tech Council of Australia. it feels like the start of something bigger, maybe even a storm brewing between innovation and regulation. The silence that followed spoke louder than any press release.  

I couldn’t help but wonder what really went on behind the scenes.  

When I think about it, tech companies like OpenAI have always lived in that space between bold ideas and cautious governments. It reminded me of how in 2018, when local startups in Bengaluru started clashing with data laws, everyone could feel the tension chaotic yet somehow thrilling. AI firms now face the same crossroads. Governments want control, oversight, maybe even dominance. But innovators? They crave freedom, speed, and sometimes a little bit of rule-bending. The divergence from the council might just be OpenAI’s way of saying, “We don’t want to be boxed in.” It’s not defiance exactly more like self-preservation. Still, it hints at this uneasy dance that keeps getting faster with each new algorithm or regulation draft.  

It worries me a little, to be honest.  

Because when big tech and governments stop talking, history shows, misunderstandings grow fast. Today it’s about policy differences; tomorrow, it could be about power. AI is different it touches everything, from education policies to military systems. When I read that OpenAI’s move might reflect deeper disagreements about AI safety governance, I felt that quiet chill the kind you get before a thunderstorm during monsoon nights in Mumbai.  

Maybe collision is inevitable. Or maybe it’s necessary. These tensions could force both sides to redefine boundaries governments learning flexibility, tech firms learning humility. After all, progress without accountability can’t last.  

Still, a part of me secretly hopes for dialogue over conflict. I imagine a future where engineers, ethicists, and lawmakers sit in the same room sharing coffee instead of headlines. It sounds idealistic, I know. But sometimes, optimism is the only thing that keeps innovation human. And maybe that’s the real message behind OpenAI stepping away — not rebellion, just a reminder that the future doesn’t belong to control alone, but to conversation.

Obviously October is not over and there is still 2 weeks left, in which the market will probs recover and prove Uptober correct again, still though there is extreme fear in the market and many people will be exiting. This is going to be deadly for many coins, gambling or doing crazy leverage trades in these market conditions is crazy, instead invest in high conviction plays that are here to stay, not phases.

IMO these are the types of characteristics to look for:

Coins that have been around for over a year
Coins that are community based and do not rely on KOLs
Coins that have a very good distribution
Communities that have not stopped working during the recent crash
This is why I would recommend Kendu

 Here is why:

Community Strength:

Strongest community on Reddit and Stocktwits by far, whilst being one of the strongest on X
2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes for the free audit, only other coin to ever manage this was Pepe
Over 20 community led IRL initiatives, for example coffee and beer
Kendu has a higher Telegram activity than SPX, Giga and Mog
Distribution:

59% of supply hasn’t moved in over a year
77% hasn’t moved in over 6 months
Only ~10% of supply sits in LPs or CEX wallets
HHI score is 26 - which is absolutely insane
Kendu is the play this cycle for sure, insane communities never lose, they always have massive gains. It has a distribution that is actually unmatched, especially at these levels, sell pressure is gonna be so low for a while, only reason for todays dip was because ETH dropped....

Kendu has just underwent a very long and drawn out redistribution phase, we know what this means...this means that a massive pump is imminent. Supply has moved into the hands of true believers and it ain't going anywhere!

All the signs are there, the future is right in front of your eyes... Do you want to be a part of crypto history?

I just really need to let this out and maybe get some advice or perspective.

I (36F) and my partner (36M) have been together for 17 years. We live together, and he’s a hardworking, responsible provider. I truly appreciate that about him. But he’s also deeply into gaming, and lately, it’s starting to feel like I’ve lost him to it.

After work, he can play for 5 to 8 hours straight. On weekends, if I leave him alone, he could easily play all day. I try to be understanding since it’s his way of relaxing, but I can’t help feeling invisible. We barely have intimacy anymore, and our “quality time” feels scheduled, like an appointment rather than something natural. He’d rather stay home and play than go out or do anything together.

I’m not the type to just sit around either. I used to be active, into martial arts, running, and outdoor adventures. I’ve always been an attractive, confident person who takes care of herself and enjoys life. But because of some health issues, I’ve had to slow down. Still, I have many interests, I work as a freelancer, and I try to keep life engaging. Yet lately, it feels like I’m the only one trying to keep our connection alive while he just logs into another game.

He’s really addicted to gaming, and I know I can’t stop him, nor do I want to. I just wish he had a sense of discipline and balance. When he was still employed, at least his routine kept him grounded, but since he resigned, the gaming has taken over completely.

I’ve been doing most of the household chores and work, and it’s starting to wear me out. I even decided to outsource some of my freelance work to him, hoping it would make him more responsible and help him feel like a man with purpose again. I thought maybe that would help him regain his focus, but nothing really changed.

To be fair, I know I’m not the only one struggling. I’ve been sick, and he has been the one shouldering my medical expenses and maintenance, which I know isn’t easy. I understand the burden he’s carrying, and I’m grateful for that. But on this matter, his gaming and our growing distance, I honestly don’t know what to do anymore.

We’re also trying to have a baby, and I know my illness might be one factor. But how can we even try when he’s glued to gaming and there’s barely any intimacy left?

There are times I’ve decided to literally fly away, take a short vacation to the province just to escape the situation and clear my mind, hoping that maybe some distance would make things better when I come back. But every time I return, it goes back to the same thing. Nothing really changes. And honestly, I’m just getting tired.

I’ve been silently struggling. There are nights I cry because I feel lonely even when he’s right there beside me. I’ve started having anxiety attacks and depressive episodes. I still love him deeply, but I’m reaching a point where I don’t know what to do anymore.

The truth is, I’ve always dreamed of living, not just existing.
I dream about traveling, having coffee and breakfast by the mountains, the beach, or somewhere surrounded by nature. I want to feel the world again, not just be stuck inside the house. Lately, it feels like I’m drowning in loneliness, and it scares me. I don’t want to grow old like this, feeling unseen, unloved, and disconnected from the life I once imagined.

I don’t want to control him or take away what he enjoys. I just want to feel like we still have a connection, that I still matter to him outside of his games.

Has anyone else been in this kind of situation? How did you handle it?
How do you reconnect with someone who seems emotionally checked out?

Any advice would mean a lot. Thank you for reading this 🤍

TL;DR:
36F with 36M partner, together for 17 years. He’s a good man but addicted to gaming, and it’s made our relationship distant and sexless. I still love him, but I’m exhausted, lonely, and unsure how to bring back our connection. ",6,1760757068.0,relationships,7,0.8,False

I was tired of working in the US so I decided to move to Ecuador to work online, but when I got here I didn't feel like applying for remote jobs or working 8 hours a day so I haven't really done that.

I live with a local family in Ambato, my life is about 150/month. Rent is 80, I mostly eat rice and potatoes and don't spend money on much else. Luckily I have a really nice Bulgarian classical guitar and a Kobo for reading.

When I last posted I think I had about $800 left, I can report that now I have about $450 so still good for a few more months! I definitely don't want to go back to the US as I'd be fined for overstaying here in Ecuador and possibly banned for a while, which would really suck.

Most days start slow, I have breakfast with the family, make some coffee by holding a filter over a coffee mug and pouring the water over it (no money for coffee machine), lately I've been reading some French Lit like Michaeux's Plume or Mount Analogue by Daumal. After that I spend a few hours playing classical guitar (Villa-Lobos and Bach), go for a walk to the market and cook dinner, do some people watching and then go to bed.

The family recently asked me if I was going to work but I just told them I had plenty of savings, which is partially true, so yeah.

Anyways just wanted to share my story again as inspiration, you don't need money to be a digital nomad! Obviously I'll have to figure things out when I run out of $$$ but until that happens, I'm taking it easy down here in Ambato.

***Spoons***  

“*Hiccup!*”

Merrin’s entire body shuddered violently as yet another hiccup wracked its way through him. It had been centuries since he had suffered the indignity of hiccups, and now he had to deal with them in *public*. Not that the Fun Tea Friday Cafe - where everyday was Friday - was the sort of “public” that mattered to his position. This was a little pocket dimension he could escape into, meet some interesting people from other realms, and relax some.

But to have the *hiccups* because his tea had been brewed too hot? *Embarrassing!*

“*Hiccup!*” 

Merrin clamped his hand as tight as he could around his mouth, though the fluffy white beard made it less than a perfect seal. He looked around to see if he’d yet attracted attention and, unfortunately, he had.

The faces Merrin didn’t recognize apparently hadn’t noticed him, but a few regulars were looking his way. Vlad gave him an inquisitive look with an impressively raised eyebrow; his pallid complexion and dark, slicked-back hair emphasized the expression.

“Are you well?” he asked in a campy accent.

“Fine,” Merrin muttered. The wizard began an incantation but hiccuped in the middle of it. He sighed - and hiccuped - and swore. A simple spell could cure the hiccups in anyone, but only if he could complete it without interruption.

“Have you tried holding your breath?” Vlad asked.

“That doesn’t - *hiccup* - work,” Merrin grumbled. After speaking he opted not to inhale and, instead, held his lungs empty long enough for two more hiccups to make his chest ache.

“It has always aided me.” The vampire picked up his cup of red-tinged coffee and took a seat across from Merrin. “Come, just take a deep breath in through your nose and-”

“Nah, what you gotta do is inhale through your mouth, not your nose.” A spectral figure drifted up through the seat beside Vlad. “Then you swallow *twice*, and exhale through your nose as slow as you can.”

“When was the last time *you* had hiccups, Bill?”

“Irrelevant! The cure is timeless.”

Merrin said, “I just need to-” and hiccuped again.

“Here.” A large tablespoon full of sugar appeared in front of him, held by a skeleton with a red bow on her head. “Spoon full of sugar. Swallow it. Always works.”

“Patty, please,” Merrin groaned. “I am not going to swallow - *hiccup* - pure sugar.”

“Try drinking water through a spoon,” the new Barista - Dee - said, walking over with a glass and a spoon.

“Through a spoon? *Hiccup* That’s not physically possible.”

“Sure it is, here, just bite the handle between your teeth and-”

“Uh-uh, nope,” Patty said, reaching out and smacking Dee’s hand. “He does that he’s gonna get water everywhere. Sugar’s clean and won’t-”

“Breath in through your mouth-” Bill tried to say over Dee and Patty’s bickering.

“Nose!” Vlad interjected.

“Mouth!”

“*Hiccup*” Merrin had enough. “Abra quie-lenz-io!” His voice reverberated through the air, making a vague shimmer, like heat off asphalt, and all fell silent. Once everyone realized they were silenced and stopped moving their mouths, he cleared his throat.

“I am not going to do any new-age breathing exercises,” he said, with a pointed look at Vlad and Bill. Turning his head to Patty, he continued, “I am not going to eat a spoonful of sugar,” he looked to Dee, “nor am I going to put a spoon in my mouth and sip water around it.”

Merrin took a deep breath and puffed out his chest. He raised his hands, letting the large, baggy sleeves of his robe slide down his bony arms. “I am a wizard! A sorcerer! Mundane tricks of mind and body have no power over me. I just need a moment of peace to say a simple incantation and cure it. Now, may I have peace?”

He looked at each of them in turn. Patty somehow rolled eyes she did not have, before walking away, and Dee was visibly giggling, though the silence stifled the sound of it. She, too, walked away.

Settling back down at the table, Merrin opened his mouth to start his spell again when he noticed Vlad was signing at him, *""No more hiccups?""*

Merrin pondered that, then took a slow breath. Nothing. He took a sip of the water glass Dee had left behind and swallowed. Nothing.

""They're gone!"" He smiled. With a wave of his hand, the silence lifted.

""All of that scolding did the trick,"" Vlad said.

Bill hiccupped.

1o9kw5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1o9kw5s/i_feel_like_im_going_through_something_deeply/,I feel like I’m going through something deeply spiritual and don’t know how to explain it,"Hey everyone, for starters I’m 22F and don’t consider myself religious but I am spiritual. Spiritually has always helped me in terms of my personal growth and mental health journey the last few years etc. This year, however, I feel like I’m experiencing such deep changes that I’m not sure what to make of it and it’s driving me crazy! 

For context, a little over a year ago I met this wonderful guy, let’s call him Arthur 23M. From the moment I met Arthur, I immediately knew he was different. Through the course of our relationship I opened up to him like I never have before, in fact in ways I never even thought was possible for me at the time. Funnily enough, at first I wasn’t sure how we would work out because we were so different but somehow we meshed perfectly. The only problem was… he was not ready for a relationship. And NOT in a douche way but in a he wasn’t where he wanted to be at in life, both physically and mentally. 

After months, I finally realized even though I cared so much about him and grew to love him, he had a lot to work on in terms of his mental health and spirituality. While we had SUCH a deep bond I can’t even explain, we also had really hard times where we triggered our own insecurities and pushed each other away/shutdown which just created this cycle I don’t think we even realized we were doing. It was all in good faith though, I think we both just really opened each others eyes to our own wounds. And despite the hardships and almost endings we alwayssss pushed forward. However this day I decided to end things for real so he could finally focus on himself and just become who he wanted to be. We exchanged VERY lengthy emotional messages about how we didn’t want to lose each other and how much of an impact we had on one another etc. He apologized profusely for not being able to give me what I wanted and deserved at the moment. Which leads me to now. 

Every since I “ended” things with him (we’re still friends just don’t talk anymore really since I told him to go figure himself out) I’ve not only felt such deep gut feelings that this isn’t the end for us but I’ve also seen so many signs. My to go coffee the next morning had “everything happens for a reason” written on it. I pulled the two of cups & knight of pentacles one day and other cards/oracle telling me to be patient. Saw and even had a few ladybugs land on me. Even times where I wasn’t thinking about him or asking for a sign and BOOM immediate symbol of something that was very niche to him/us. The initial month after I was going through heartbreak like I’ve never experienced. So much so that me, a non religious girl, finally REALLY prayed to God. For the first time in my life, I felt such a pull that this was happening for a reason and I needed to be emotional and open to God about it. I’m even at the point where I’m debating buying a bible because I’m curious about it. Arthur was a Christian and we had a few talks about religion but I always made it a point that I didn’t see myself going that way. I still think religion is a complex topic for me but I’ve noticed recently Ive become a lot more open to just the idea of a God.

In terms of other aspects of my life, I don’t know how to explain it but I can feel like something is just shifting within me. There’s a lot of things I’ve been wanting to try and do lately and I’ve been spending a lot of time alone. I just want to better myself and really find who I am too. So while it’s only been two months and I go through really high and low periods of time of “I’m doing better!” to “I feel like I’m dying,” I think I’ve realized now that maybe I didn’t before, this separation is also for me. Maybe I also needed this to discover who I am and we will just come back together better than before. I just have to trust what the universe has planned for me.

I hope this all makes sense ToT I tried to summarize a years worth of this relationship without being too over detailed. I really do trust and feel with ever fiber in me that this is different than anything I’ve experienced before, let me know your thoughts and if you’ve experienced similar!

I warmed it up for 5 minutes submerged in a bowl with hot water from the coffee pot and that did really well! You can smell the butter when opening it. Dipped some of the bread in the butter and it was ok. You could really taste the parsley and garlic. If you want to dip the butter maybe keep some flaky salt on the side to sprinkle on top to really make it pop.  
  
Next I tried the deens and they were super pretty to look at. They’re firm in texture which is nice. Honestly, they’re a little on the rich side for me and I’ve never had tinned fish that was canned with butter before, but pairing with the olive muffaletta really added to the experience and helped even out the flavor profile with the savory tang. The strongest flavor to come through for me is the garlic followed by the mild herbiness of the parsley. The butter is a little bland itself, but I think a little pinch of salt or adding something like olives really helps to round it out.  
  
Overall I’d give this tin a 5/10. Not bad, I like sardines in olive oil a bit more and I wouldn’t go out of my way to buy them again, but if I found a cool recipe that called for something like this I’d try it.

It’s free, no sign-in, starts instantly. I’m looking for blunt feedback. Also made another post about this in /GREPreparation

Link in comments.

I tried a bunch of vocab tools and they never matched how I like to learn — too much setup, too many clicks, clunky UX and bad UI So I built my own between study sessions at coffee shops and libraries and used it hard for \~2 weeks before my GRE. I went from basically zero vocab and a total bot to a 165 Verbal.

What it does (simple flow):

* **Test / Normal Mode (the flagship):** You get a pool of 5 random words. You “master” a word by getting it right 4 times in a row. Once mastered, it leaves the pool and a new word drops in.
* **Instant feedback:** Miss a word? You immediately see a clean definition + example sentence.
* **Typos forgiven (\~80%):** Small spelling/punctuation mistakes don’t kill your streak.
* **Flashcards & Flashcards (fixed order):** Quick review or targeted runs for low-energy moments.
* **Wordpacks:** Hand-picked subsets with themes, focused on high-frequency GRE words.
* **Choose Words:** Build your own subset to target weaknesses (my favorite feature).

Why it worked for me:

* Zero setup. Fast UI (big readable cards, keyboard/tap friendly, dark mode).
* “Cold” testing (no hints) so you actually know what you know.
* After \~1 week the words started sticking; I internalized \~500 and got fewer surprises on test day.

How I used it (\~2 weeks):

* Spammed Test Mode \~8 hours/day.
* Used random flashcards during downtime.
* Ran fixed-order flashcards from word 0 → 800 to check coverage.
* Then used **Choose Words** to create a set of only the words I kept missing and hammered those.

It’s free and doesn’t need an account. If you try it, tell me what’s rough, which words to add, or modes you want. You can also exclude words you already know so you’re not wasting reps.

I wanted to share my experience because it might help someone who goes through the same headache with LinkedIn. It happened to me twice already, and both times I didn’t receive any warning or explanation.

What happened... 

My account suddenly got restricted. I couldn’t log in no matter what. I entered my correct email and password, passed the CAPTCHA, did the phone verification, and then the page just froze. It never took me to my profile, and it didn’t show any kind of error message.
When someone tried to view my profile from Google, it said “The profile you’re looking for isn’t public or doesn’t exist.” So it looked like my account was deleted.

First steps I tried

I went to the LinkedIn help center and tried to send a support ticket, but the form wouldn’t let me proceed with my actual account email. For some reason, it kept getting stuck. So I used a different email address just to contact support and explain the situation.

Some background

I always use a dedicated VPN based in Greece for privacy and security. I don’t change locations or use random servers.
I had already verified my ID once before, so this time I reuploaded it again but hid the ID number for safety.
I also made it clear in my message that I hadn’t broken any rules or policies.

Talking with LinkedIn support

At first, they told me they couldn’t discuss the account because I was writing from a different email.
Then they gave me a special form that doesn’t require logging in:
👉 https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TS-RHA
That one didn’t work either, so they sent me another one specifically for appeals:
👉 https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/ts-f-appeal
With that second link, I was finally able to send a full report and attach my ID again.

The good part

The LinkedIn team replied quite fast. They verified my info and removed the restriction. They said it could take up to 48 hours for my connections and followers to fully come back.
They also suggested a few security things:
• Turn on two step verification for extra security
• Check that your account emails are up to date
• Change your email password and turn on two step verification there too

What still worries me

This was the second time it happened to me even though I haven’t violated any policy. I’d really like to understand what’s triggering this because it’s stressful to lose access like that.
If I’m doing something wrong, I want to know so I can fix it. It’s frustrating to deal with restrictions when you’ve done nothing wrong.

Tips for others

Be polite and detailed when contacting support.
If the normal form doesn’t work, use both of those links I mentioned.
If necessary, write from another email and explain why.
Attach your ID with the ID number hidden for security.
And mostly, stay calm and patient. They do respond.

Question for the community

Has anyone else had their LinkedIn account restricted or removed for no reason?
Could this be related to VPN usage or maybe some automatic flagging system?

Update (The Long and Frustrating Road to Resolution)🤬

And while I was anxiously awaiting an email to regain access to my account after having already sent my ID for verification in a previous email exchange I received a new message. 

This time, I was instructed to proceed with verification via Persona, as the document I had previously sent via email was no longer considered valid and only the Persona method was accepted.
It is important to note the timing: this final, conflicting message about Persona came just 8 hours after a preceding communication from support where they assured me my account had been unblocked (which was true, as my connections could now view my profile). 

When I replied to that first agent, thanking them for lifting the unfair ban but stating that I still couldn't log in because the system was showing ""incorrect login details,"" it became clear that the agents in support were not coordinating their actions or messages.

Following this frustrating back and forth, I completed the new verification process through Persona. 
I immediately sent a follow up email to the support team, confirming that I had successfully passed the Persona verification and was now expecting them to restore my login access. 

Crucially, I reiterated my request for a detailed explanation as to why I had been unfairly restricted for a second time.
Predictably, those 'eagles' who sit in an office drinking coffee did not provide the requested clarification instead, they simply closed the case. I have since reopened the case and sent yet another follow up, as I will not rest until they provide a proper answer.

This inexplicable banning without reason is becoming far too common lately. We are not playthings, and users should not be treated this way.

If you’re facing something similar:

Be patient and document everything. 
Don’t send your ID through email use their Persona upload link instead.
 If you get conflicting answers, insist politely and ask for clarification.
 Re enable two step verification once you get your access back.
Hopefully, this helps someone who ends up stuck in the same LinkedIn verification loop.",2,1760755699.0,LinkedInTips,0,1.0,False

I’m 22 years old and most days you’ll find me behind the counter at the gas station. Nothing fancy tho...just doing my job, same as always. I clock in check the pumps, stock the shelves and keep the coffee fresh. People come and go. some in a rush some just killing time. I’ve got my regulars and I know who’s going to ask for a receipt before they even say a word.

It’s not exciting, but.. I like knowing what to expect. I keep my head down, do what needs doing, and make sure the place runs smooth. No drama, no surprises. Just another day, same as the last.

a guy in suit and tie with curly hair walks in and says ""excuse me ma'am you're gas machines is not working""

I looked up from the counter blinking once to make sure I heard him right. He’s standing there with his receipt in one hand and a confused look on his face.

“Which one?” I ask already reaching for the clipboard under the register. It’s always something...pump 3 acting up again or maybe the card reader on 7 froze. He gestures toward the far end of the lot.

“Pump 5” he says. “I tried to start it, but nothing happened.”

I nod grabbing the keys, and step out into the sun. Just another hiccup in the day. I’ve dealt with worse. I press the reset button, check the screen, and give it a quick tap like I’ve done a hundred times before.

“Try it now,” I say and he gives me a thumbs-up.

Back inside, I jot it down in the log. Nothing out of the ordinary. Just doing my job.
I watched him walk back to his car but something about the way he moved didn’t sit right with me. He wasn’t rude or anything polite even but there was this weird stillness in his eyes like he was watching everything and nothing at the same time. His smile didn’t reach his face, and when he said “ma’am” it felt rehearsed, like he was playing a part.

I’ve seen all kinds come through here late-night wanderers road weary travelers, folks just trying to get home. But this guy? He stayed. Not long enough to make a scene, just long enough to make me notice. I couldn’t put my finger on it  but I kept looking at the security camera monitor after he left just to be sure.
Maybe it was nothing. Maybe I’m just tired. But I’ve learned to trust that little twist in my gut. It doesn’t speak up often but when it does I listen.

I get home around 10 most nights. The apartment’s quiet just me and the hum of the fridge. It’s a one-bedroom, nothing special but it’s mine. I like the way the light hits the wall in the morning land how I can hear the rain tapping on the window when it storms.

There’s not much food in the kitchen right now. A couple of instant noodles, maybe a can of beans. I keep telling myself I’ll go grocery shopping after work, but by the time I get off I’m too tired or too broke or both. I’ll make it work though. I always do.

It’s not perfect but it’s my space. No parents no roommates no one telling me how to live. Just me, figuring it out one day at a time.

There’s this one neighbor in the unit next to mine always up late always making noise. I don’t know their name, and I’ve never seen any kids around, not that I’d expect to. It’s just them, I think. Music, stomping, sometimes what sounds like furniture being dragged across the floor at two in the morning. I’ve tried earplugs, white noise, even sleeping on the couch once. Nothing helps.

I lie there staring at the ceiling, counting the seconds between thumps wondering what they’re doing. It’s not loud enough to call the landlord, but just enough to keep me from drifting off. I’ve thought about knocking on their door, but I don’t want to start anything. So I wait it out, hoping they’ll settle down. They usually do eventually.

Still I wake up groggy dragging myself to work with half a night’s sleep and a headache that feels like it’s been waiting for me.

Some  days, it’s just me. I don’t mind the quiet I’ve gotten used to it. I go to work, come home, heat something up if there’s anything left in the cupboard, and let the hours pass. I’m not big on crowds or small talk. I like things simple, predictable.

I do have one friend I see every now and then. We don’t talk every day, but when we do it’s easy. No pressure, no pretending. Sometimes we grab coffee, sometimes we just sit in the car and talk about nothing. It’s nice, having someone who doesn’t expect much but still shows up.

Still, I spend most of my time alone. Not lonely, exactly—just... quiet. I guess that’s how I like it.

On my off days, when I don’t have to deal with gas pumps or awkward customers I like to sink into the couch and put on a classic horror film. The kind that’s grainy and weird and doesn’t care if the ending makes sense. Nightmare on Elm Street  Dead of Night. Re-Animator those are my go-tos..

I’ll make a cup of instant coffee, pull the blanket over my legs, and let the  screen take over.  Sometimes I text my friend about the weirdest scenes..also i think my boss is a Weirdo and his Freakish  mustache.. Speaking of Which he's parking and getting out his Car right now.

""Hey maria I need you on bathroom duty"" he says 

I stare at him for a second, trying not to let my face show what I’m thinking. Bathroom duty. Of course. The same bathroom that’s been ignored for half a year, the one customers complain about but nobody ever touches. And now, suddenly, it’s my problem?

“Sure” I say, flat. No emotion. Just enough to keep things civil.

But inside, I’m boiling. He waits until the end of the shift, when I’m tired and just trying to get through the day, and then drops this on me like it’s nothing. Like it’s normal. Like I’m supposed to smile and grab the mop.

I grab the keys and head toward the back, already dreading what I’ll find. The smell hits before I even open the door. I pause, take a breath, and remind myself: just get through it. One more task. One more day.

But yeah he’s sick in the head if he thinks this is okay.

I stepped into that bathroom and froze. I kid you not—there was feces on the floor. Not just a mess, not just a spill—this was deliberate. It was smeared on the walls like someone had thrown it, like they wanted to leave a message in the worst way possible. The stench hit me like a punch to the gut. I gagged, covered my mouth, and backed out for a second just to breathe.

“What the heck is this?” I whispered to myself, trying not to lose it. I could almost puke. I’ve seen some nasty things working here, but this? This was next-level. I stood there, staring at the mess, thinking about quitting right then and there. Just walking out, leaving the keys on the counter, and never looking back.

But I didn’t. I kept my cool. Took a breath. Grabbed gloves and cleaner. Not because I wanted to—because I had to. Because no one else was going to do it, and I wasn’t about to let this place fall apart on my watch. I cleaned it up, one wipe at a time, trying not to think too hard about what kind of person does something like that.

I logged it. I made a note. And I moved on. But yeah—some days, this job tests you in ways you don’t expect.

I clocked out, wiped my hands on my jeans, and didn’t even look back at the station. I was done. The bathroom incident had drained whatever patience I had left. I called an Uber, hoping for silence, maybe a smooth ride home where I could just stare out the window and pretend the day hadn’t happened.

But of course, I’d left my headphones at home. Rookie mistake.

The driver looked like he was pushing fifty, salt-and-pepper hair, wedding ring glinting on the steering wheel. And the moment I shut the door, he started talking. Not small talk-- NO! this was full-blown venting. His wife didn’t understand him, his kids were distant, and apparently his dog preferred her over him. I nodded politely, gave the occasional “oh wow,” but inside I was screaming. I could honestly wish my head exploded right there in the back seat, just to escape the monologue.

I stared out the window, counting streetlights, trying to tune him out with nothing but my own thoughts. By the time we pulled up to my apartment, I felt like I’d aged a year. I tipped him out of guilt, not generosity, and trudged upstairs to my quiet, one-bedroom sanctuary. No talking. No drama. Just me, and the silence I’d been craving all day.

I peel off my work clothes, one layer at a time, like shedding the day. The bathroom light hums overhead, and the tile’s cool under my feet. I step into the shower and let the warm water run over me, slow and steady. It feels good—like I’m washing off more than just dirt. I grab the soap, scrub hard, trying to erase the memory of that bathroom at the station.

But the smell sticks. It’s in my nose, in my thoughts, like it followed me home. I scrub again, harder this time, until my skin feels raw. I close my eyes and let the steam rise around me, hoping it’ll carry the day away with it.

Eventually, I turn off the water, wrap myself in a towel, and stand there for a moment. Clean, but still unsettled. Some things stick longer than they should.

After the shower, I stand at the sink and take my time—fifteen full minutes just on my face. I scrub gently but thoroughly, making sure every trace of the day is gone. I check the mirror, tilt my head, rinse again. It’s not just about hygiene—it’s about control, about feeling like I’ve reclaimed something after everything that happened.

I fix my hair next, brushing it until it sits just right. The rhythm of it calms me. Then I brush my teeth, slow and steady, letting the mint settle in. I’m obsessed with being clean, and honestly? I think that’s a good thing. It’s my reset button. My way of saying, “I’m still here. I’m still me.”

The smell from the store still sticks faintly in my memory, but it doesn’t cling to my skin anymore. I’m clean. I’m calm. I’m back in my space, and that’s enough for tonight.

I think I’m gonna watch Breaking Bad tonight. There’s not much on TV lately and I’ve been a fan of the show for years. I’m just starting Season 5, Episode 1—the beginning of the end. It’s wild how far Walt’s come, how twisted things have gotten. The writing, the tension, the way every scene feels like it’s holding its breath it’s exactly the kind of show I need after a long day.

I’ll throw on my night clothes, maybe grab something to drink, and let myself sink into it. Just me, the glow of the screen, and a story that never gets old.

Recently, I’ve been hearing more and more about kidnappings happening at night in this city. It’s unsettling. People go missing, and the police never seem to find the suspect—or the victim. It’s like they vanished without a trace, like they never existed in the first place.

One day, I heard that more than twenty people went missing. Twenty. In a single night. That number stuck with me. I don’t know if it’s true, but even the rumor is enough to make me double-check my locks and glance over my shoulder when I walk home after dark.

I keep my routines tight, stay alert, and trust my instincts. I’ve lived here long enough to know when something feels off—and lately, it feels off a lot more often...

There it goes again—the noise from the neighbors. I don’t even bother checking anymore. It’s late, and whatever they’re doing, it’s not my problem. I’ve had enough for one day. Between the mess at work, the Uber ride, and everything...

I’ll call this a night. The day’s been long, strange, and loud in all the wrong ways. But I made it through. I cleaned up the worst of it, kept my cool, and now I’m here clean, quiet, and ready to let it all go.

I’ll  pull the blanket up, and let sleep take over. Whatever tomorrow brings, I’ll handle it. Just like I always do.

Goodnight.

Tuesday | 10:00 am.

Welp, it’s morning. I drag myself out of bed, the light creeping in through the blinds like it’s daring me to face the day. Another shift at the station. Another round of weird customers, unpredictable messes, and that same stale air.

I think about calling in sick. Just one day to myself—to breathe, to reset, to not be responsible for anyone else’s chaos. It’s tempting. I could spend the day doing whatever: writing, watching something decent maybe even just sitting in silence.

But first, I shower. The water’s warm. I scrub slowly, letting the steam wake me up. No matter what I decide, this part’s mine.

After I finish bathing, I pat my skin dry and reach for the ointment. I smooth it over the spots that need it—routine, careful, like I’ve done a hundred times before. It’s part of the process now, part of keeping myself steady.

Then I brush my hair, slow and methodical, watching it fall into place in the mirror. I brush my teeth next letting the mint settle in and clear away the last traces of sleep. The whole routine feels like armor clean skin clean hair clean breath. I move through each step like clockwork, and by the end of it  I feel ready. Not excited, not energized just ready. That’s enough.

I began by putting on my work clothes, each piece a signal that the day was officially starting. The air felt heavy, like the city hadn’t quite woken up yet. Before heading out, I grabbed my headphones thankfully I didn’t forget them this time and hit play on Tears Don’t Fall by Bullet for My Valentine.

I called an Uber to get to work. It took 40 minutes longer than usual and I felt every second of it. As I waited, I kept hoping this driver wouldn’t start unloading their personal drama the moment I got in. I just wanted quiet. A ride where I could zone out, maybe let the music carry me through the morning without someone narrating their life story.

When the car pulled up, I hesitated for a second before getting in. Just me, the seat and the hope that today’s ride would be uneventful. I’ve got enough on my plate without playing therapist before my shift even starts.

“So where we headed to?” the Uber driver asks, glancing at me through the rearview mirror.

I tell him the name of my job, short and to the point. No extra details. Then I put my headphones back in and let the music take over. I’m not in the mood for small talk, especially not someone else’s life story before I’ve even clocked in.

The car drives along the road, and I stare out the window, watching the city pass by in fragments. Just me, the music, and the ride. That’s all I need right now.

I finally arrived at work it felt like forever in that car. The ride dragged and by the time I stepped out, my legs were stiff and my patience thin. I unlocked the doors. and started putting everything where it needed to be.

Trash bins, supplies, register each piece fell into place like muscle memory. I didn’t waste time. I just got stuff done. The station was quiet for now, but I knew it wouldn’t last. I braced myself for whatever the day decided to throw at me.

I started by sweeping the floor the Dust, crumbs, bits of whatever gone with each pass. Then I filled the mop bucket, the water cloudy and warm, and started working the floor in slow strokes.

After that, I moved to the windows. The glass was streaked from the night, fingerprints and smudges catching the morning light. I sprayed and wiped until they were clear again, watching the outside world sharpen into focus. It’s quiet work, but it gets me grounded. One task at a time..

It’s 9:59 p.m. just a few more seconds and I’m out of here. I grab the last box of chips, slide them into place on the shelf, lining them up neat like I always do. The store’s quiet now, fluorescent lights humming overhead, and the air feels still, like it’s waiting for me to clock out.

I take one last look around. Everything’s where it should be. Clean floors, stocked shelves, register shut down. I did my part. Time to go.

Suddenly a rock crashes against the window sharp loud like a gunshot in the quiet. I hear laughter high-pitched and fading fast as a car speeds off down the road. I run outside, heart pounding, and see the glass shattered jagged edges catching the light.

“What the—”

I just stand there for a second, staring at the mess. Then I sigh deep and tired, and go back in. No point chasing ghosts. I’ll have to report it, maybe sweep up the shards, maybe not. It’s late. I just want to go home.

I cleaned up the broken glass, sweeping carefully around the edges and making sure no shards were left behind. The air still felt tense, like the laughter from those kids hadn’t quite faded. After everything was cleared, I picked up the phone and called my boss.

I kept it simple just the facts. Told him what happened, how I handled it, and that the window’s going to need replacing. He didn’t say much, just the usual sigh and a promise to “look into it.” I hung up, locked the door, and stood there for a moment, letting the quiet settle back in. Another night, another mess.

After that My phone died and just like that, I was stuck walking to the train station at night. The streets felt emptier than usual too quiet, too still. Every shadow stretched longer, every sound sharper. I kept my pace steady, eyes scanning the sidewalks, alleys, parked cars. I knew what kind of stories floated around here. Kidnappings disappearances. People who didn’t make it home.

I stayed close to the streetlights, avoided shortcuts, and kept my hands free. No music, no distractions. my footsteps, moving fast but not panicked. I trusted my instincts. I’ve made it through worse. I just needed to get to the station, get on that train, and get home.

As I’m walking, I catch something in the shadow of an alley—low to the ground, unmoving, but its eyes glow red. Not like a reflection. Like they’re watching me. I freeze, heart thudding, and take a slow step back  The air feels colder suddenly, like the night’s holding its breath.

Then headlights cut through the dark. An old woman pulls up in a faded sedan window rolled down just enough.

“You need a ride, young lady?” she asks, voice calm, almost too calm.

I don’t hesitate. I nod, open the door, and slide in. Whatever that thing was, I’m not sticking around to find out. The car smells like lavender and old upholstery. I don’t ask questions. I just watch the alley fade in the rearview mirror.

“A young lady like you shouldn’t be walking around so late,” she says, her with concern. “What were you doing?”

“Uh… I was walking to the bus station,” I reply, trying to sound casual, like it’s no big deal.

She glances at me, then back at the road. “It’s not safe out here anymore. Not like it used to be.”

I nod, not really wanting to get into it. I just want to get home.

“They say they’re doing everything they can to find those victims, huh?” the old lady says her eyes on the road ahead. “I don’t believe that one bit.”

I stay quiet. There’s something heavy in her voice like she’s seen too much, heard too many promises that went nowhere. The car goes along, streetlights flickering past the windows. I glance out half expecting to see those red eyes again.

She doesn’t say anything else for a while, and I don’t press. Some truths don’t need answers. They just sit there, quiet and sharp.

I asked her if she had any kids, just trying to kill the silence, maybe shift the mood.

She nodded slowly. “Three,” she said. “Had three. Two of them… they died. Night forest attack. Long time ago.”

Her voice didn’t crack, but something in her eyes did. I didn’t know what to say. Just sat there letting the weight of her words settle between us. I felt bad for her really bad. That kind of loss doesn’t fade. It just folds into who you are.

The car kept moving, but the air inside felt still. I didn’t ask anything else. Some stories don’t need follow-ups.

I tell her to stop my destination’s just up ahead, my house only a minute away. She pulls over gently, the car slowing to a quiet halt under the streetlight. I reach for the door handle, and before I step out, she looks at me with a kind, tired smile.

“Stay safe, honey,” she says.

I nod “thank you,”

I began walking up the stairs, each step heavier than the last. When I reached my floor something felt off. My door—usually locked tight was cracked open. Just enough to make my stomach drop.

I stepped inside slowly. The apartment was a mess. Things out of place Heck even. Drawers open. My routine, my order disturbed...crap

I didn’t hesitate. I went straight! to the vent near the floor grabbed the screwdriver from the drawer and unscrewed it with steady hands. Inside, untouched were my dual pistols. I pulled them out checked the chambers, and stood up.

Whatever this was, I wasn’t going to be caught off guard.



I walk slowly through the apartment, dual pistols raised, every breath tight in my chest. The silence is thick—too thick. Then, out of nowhere, it lunges from the hallway shadows, slamming me to the ground with a weight that knocks the air out of me.

Its eyes burn red, teeth bared, jaws opening wide. I don’t wait. I jam both barrels into its ribcage and pull the triggers twice, each side. The shots echo like thunder in the small space, and the thing screeches, stumbling back, smoke rising from the wounds.

But it doesn’t stay down. The flesh knits itself back together slow. It’s healing.

I scramble to my feet, heart pounding, sweat cold on my back. This thing isn’t just breaking in it’s hunting.

It hurls the TV at me no warning, just raw force. I dive to the side, barely missing the impact as the screen shatters against the floor, glass and plastic exploding across the room. The sound is deafening a crunch and crack off the walls.

I hit the ground hard, but I’m still holding the pistols. My ears ring, my pulse spikes, and I scramble behind the couch for cover.


It hurls the couch like it weighs nothing, crashing into the wall behind me. Before I can react, it’s on me—claws digging in, its grip tightening around my neck. My vision blurs, breath caught in my throat.

But I don’t panic.

I raise one pistol, press it against the side of its neck, and fire. The shot rips through flesh, and it lets out a guttural snarl, stumbling back just enough for me to breathe again. Smoke curls from the wound, but I can already see it starting to close.

It’s buying me seconds. That’s all I need.

I crawl toward the katana, fingers brushing the hilt just as I hear it charging. The floorboards creak under its weight, and I don’t think I just move. I spin, blade slicing through the air, and catch it clean across the neck.

Its head hits the ground with a wet thud, and dark green goo sprays everywhere—my face, my hair, my clothes. I sit down hard, breath ragged, staring up at the ceiling like it might offer answers.

So… yeah. I kill vampires.

I’m a vampire hunter.

I glance around glass shards, busted furniture green goo smeared across the walls and floor. My TV’s a wreck, the couch’s halfway across the room, and the smell of gunpowder still sticks My perfect hair’s sticky, my face’s got streaks of vampire sludge, and the pistols are still warm in my hands.

“Aw man,” I mutter dragging a hand down my cheek. “Look at this place. It’s all messy.”

I sit there, legs stretched out, katana resting beside me and just breathe. Cleanup can wait. Right now, I’m alive. And that’s enough.

I get up, still catching my breath, and look over at the wreckage. The TV’s a mess—screen spiderwebbed with cracks, plastic frame bent, wires poking out like guts.

“Awe man,” I say rubbing my face. “That cost me five hundred dollars.”

I crouch down, poking at the shards like they might magically fix themselves. “Dang it… it’s freaking shattered.”

The room smells like gunpowder and vampire goo. My hair’s ruined, my couch’s halfway to the kitchen, and now I’ve got no TV. Great. Just great. I sit back down, katana across my lap, and stare at the ceiling again. Welcome to the life.

The vampire’s body begins to crumble, the edges of its form breaking apart like dry ash caught in a breeze. No flames, no screams just silence as it disintegrates into dust, swirling briefly in the air before settling across the floor in a thin, dark layer.

I stand there, goo still clinging to my clothes, watching the last flecks vanish. The room’s quiet again. Too quiet. Like the fight never happened except for the mess, the broken furniture, and the smell of scorched decay.

I wipe my face, exhale slowly, and say to myself, “Guess I’ll add that to the log.”


Mrs. Baker stands outside in her slippers, arms crossed, white hair catching the porch light like a halo. Her voice cuts through the quiet

“Girl, what foolishness are you doing up here now? My son Elijah is sleeping and you’re keeping him up he’s got work in the morning, girl!”

I wipe some of the goo off my cheek, still catching my breath, and nod.

“Sorry, Mrs. Baker. It won’t happen again.”

She squints at me, probably noticing the mess behind me, the broken window, the faint smell of gunpowder. But she doesn’t ask. Just shakes her head and mutters something about “young folks and their chaos” before heading back inside.

That’s Mrs. Baker. Always watching. Always saying what needs to be said.

I think imma just head to bed. Yep… that’s actually what I’m going to do.  

I’ve got vampire goo in my hair, my TV’s a pile of shattered dreams, and Mrs. Baker probably freaking thinks I’m summoning demons up here..or sum 

I holster the pistols, wipe down the katana, and step over the mess like it’s just another Tuesday. I flick off the hallway light lay into bed, and let the silence wrap around me.  

Tomorrow’s problems can wait. Tonight, I sleep.

Wednesday | 9:00 am

I woke up early today and oh my God... I look ten times worse!! than I did last night. My hair’s a disaster, my face looks like it lost a fight with a blender and don’t even get me started on the goo crusted on my shirt. I might cry. Like seriously, Jesus take the wheel, I look like crap.

So help me God, if I don’t fix myself, I’m going to jump off a bridge ughhhhhhh. Not really obviously. I’m not about that life. But still. I look like a unicorn alien took a crap on me and then high-fived my soul on the way out.

I need a shower, a comb, maybe a small miracle.


There’s a knock at the door. I freeze mid-step, still in my oversized hoodie, hair looking like it lost a fight with a tornado. I don’t remember calling anyone over. I peek through the peephole—Ellie. Of course my best friend.

I open the door, and she steps in, backpack slung over one shoulder, eyes immediately scanning the wreckage.

“Uh hey Maria—wowhoho what happened here?! Huhh.”

I laugh it off, trying to sound casual. “It was a party. With a boy. Yep. Multiple boys actually. Mhm. Wild night.”

She squints at me like I just told her I joined a circus. “Maria, I’ve known you since middle school. You’re a freaking introvert. No boys would be over here. If anything, you avoid men and sit alone with emo music.”

I raise a finger. “First of all I’m not emo. Second… okay yeah, fair.”

She squints at me, nose wrinkling. “And what is that weird green stuff on you—wait don’t tell me. I don’t wanna hear about your weird emo fantasies or anything like that. But anyways I wanted to ask you Do you want to get some food with me?”

I blink still crusty from battle, hair in full chaos mode. “Sure, I guess I have time. Just let me finish up myself okay?”

She nods, already halfway out the door. “Okay Maria. I’ll be waiting downstairs.”

I close the door behind her glance at the mirror and sigh. Emo fantasies i say. I’m not emo. I just kill vampires and occasionally look like a rejected extra from a sci-fi horror flick. Big difference..

After scrubbing off the vampire goo and reclaiming some semblance of humanity, I get dressed. Black sweater, sleeves a little too long on my arms like armor. Tattoo choker snug around my neck.

a pleated black skirt swishes just right when I move, paired with black and white striped thigh-high socks And then the boots Lamado Overkills. Chunky, unapologetic loud. They thud against the floor like a warning.

I glance in the mirror. Still tired.

I'm definitely not the energetic type. I don’t bounce into rooms or light up conversations. I’m soft-spoken, always have been. Even with friends, my voice stays low. I say what I mean, but I don’t say much. Ellie talks enough for both of us anyway.




I walk out the door, boots thudding against the hallway floor with every step. The morning light hits just right, catching the edge of my choker and the stripes on my socks. I feel halfway human again.

Ellie leaning against the stairwell railing, scrolling through her phone. She looks up and grins.

“Looking good girl.”

I smirk brushing a hand through my hair. 

She laughs, already turning toward the exit. “Come on”


“So how’s that university thing going on?” I ask her, keeping my voice low like always.

She lights up instantly. “It’s going good, actually. It’s great—making friends and stuff” she says, swinging her bag a little as we walk.

Normally I don’t like small talk. It feels forced like chewing on cardboard. But Ellie's different. With her, it’s easy. I don’t have to pretend to be louder than I am or explain why I’d rather sit in silence.. She gets it. She always has.

I nod letting her talk and the morning feels a little less heavy.

“Well I’m happy you’re doing well for yourself,” I say my voice soft like always.

Ellie smiles, nudging me with her elbow. “Thanks, Maria. You know I’m just trying to survive midterms and not cry in public.”

I chuckle, boots thudding against the pavement as we walk. The morning’s still cool the sky pale. It’s nice this quiet. I don’t talk much.. but with her I don’t have to.

When I’m not working my day job at the gas station dealing with broken pumps, weird customers, and the occasional spilled slushie or hanging out with Ellie's or just enjoying some quiet alone time in my apartment, I spend my nights hunting vampires.

It’s not a hobby. It’s a necessity. They’re real they’re dangerous, and they don’t care if you’re tired from a double shift or just want to eat ramen in peace.

Ellie doesn’t know. She thinks I’m just introverted a little weird, maybe too into horror movies. She doesn’t know vampires exist let alone that I’ve taken down more than a few. I keep it that way. She’s got her university life her friends her midterms. She doesn’t need this kind of chaos.

So I keep it quiet.. I clean my gear track patterns, and when the sun goes down, I go to work. Alone. Always alone..

“Ah, here after you, bestie,” Ellie says, pushing open the door to the coffee place with a smile.

I step in behind her, boots thudding  against the polished floor. The place smells like cinnamon and espresso, warm and unfamiliar. I glance around mismatched chairs, a chalkboard menu with drinks I’ve never heard of.

I’ve never seen this place before. Then again I rarely leave the house unless it’s work groceries or vampire-related. Samantha’s the explorer. I’m the quiet shadow that follows when invited.

She’s already waving at the barista like she’s been here a hundred times. I tuck my hands into my sleeves and scan the menu trying not to look too out of place.


She ordered for me, like she always does. Not because I can’t order for myself—I can—but because she knows I hate the whole process. The staring at the menu, the awkward “uh, I’ll have…” moment, the pressure to sound decisive when I’d rather just whisper my order and disappear.

Ellie gets that. She’s kind like that. She doesn’t make a thing out of it, doesn’t tease me or act like she’s doing me a favor. She just does it, like it’s the most normal thing in the world.

I sit down at a corner table, letting the warm coffee shop settle around me. It’s nice. Quiet. And with her around I don’t have to explain myself.

She started talking about university her classes her new friends some professor who apparently looks like a tired raccoon. I just sat there, sipping my drink. She was so happy to tell me everything, her eyes lighting up with every story.

I didn’t say much. I rarely do. But I smiled, nodded, let her talk. It’s nice, seeing her like this. Like the world’s finally opening up for her. And even if I don’t always know what to say, I’m glad she wants to share it with me.


She’s a bit younger than me—like 21—but it doesn’t really feel like it. Ellie's got this energy, this way of talking like the world’s still unfolding in front of her, and she’s ready to dive in. I admire that, even if I don’t say it out loud.

Me? I’ve seen a few more things. Worked longer hours. Fought things she doesn’t even know exist. But when we’re sitting across from each other in a coffee shop, her rambling about campus life and me quietly sipping my drink, it doesn’t matter. She’s my friend. My exception. And I like hearing her talk.

I gave myself the nickname Void. Or sometimes, VoidHunter depends on the night. It started as a joke in my logbook, but it stuck. It fits.

Ellie doesn’t know. She thinks I’m just Maria soft-spoken, introverted, the girl who wears striped socks and listens to weird music. She doesn’t know what I do when the sun goes down. Doesn’t know about the green blood, the broken katana the way I catalog every encounter like it’s a science.

A while back I built a jet pack.

It started as a late-night idea one of those “what if” moments that spiraled into soldering wires on my kitchen floor and scavenging parts from old appliances. I had no blueprint, just instinct and stubbornness. It looked like a mess of metal and ambition, but somehow, it worked. Kind of.

Let’s just say the first test flight didn’t go as planned. I got about ten feet off the ground before the thing sputtered, spun, and nearly slammed me into a dumpster behind the gas station. I limped home with bruises, a cracked phone, and a new rule: no airborne experiments without a helmet.

I was still 18. Barely. And very lucky. But I learned something that night about gravity combustion, and the fine line between genius and disaster.

Mrs. Baker was furious.

I’d barely limped back from the jet pack incident, half-covered in soot and adrenaline, when she stormed out of her apartment in her nightgown and slippers, arms crossed like a judge about to deliver a sentence.

“This girl and her foolishness” she said eyeing the cracked pavement and the suspiciously spiderwebbed windshield of Mr. Patel’s sedan.

I didn’t argue. Just nodded, apologized, and promised to keep the noise down next time. She huffed, turned on her heel and disappeared back inside, probably to call someone about “the menace upstairs.”

I added a note to my logbook: Jet pack test fail. Mrs. Baker unimpressed. Possible property damage. Avoid future launches near residential zones.


Ellie tilts her head, sipping her iced coffee. “So what do you do Maria?”

I answer fast almost out of reflex. “Gas station worker.”

She nods, like that makes sense. Like it fits. And it does on the surface. I handle pumps, clean messes, deal with customers who think I control the weather and fuel prices. It’s simple, predictable.

She doesn’t ask more. Doesn’t press. She thinks that’s all there is.

She doesn’t know about the logbook hidden under my bed. The gear stashed in my closet. The nights I come home with cuts I can’t explain and stories I’ll never tell.

Gas station worker by day. VoidHunter by night.


The suspect’s name is actually Marcos Gonzales, not Carl Gonzales. He was arrested in Vacaville for kidnapping and sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl at gunpoint.  

Ellie words  in my head, but something doesn’t sit right. I check the name Carl Gonzales and it turns out she’s slightly off. The man arrested for the kidnapping wasn’t Carl, but Marcos Gonzales, a 38-year-old Tacaville resident. According to police reports, the incident happened early on July 6th near Tacaville High School. The victim managed to call 911 after the assault, and officers responded quickly.

Marcos was arrested within hours, found with a registered firearm, and charged with multiple felonies including kidnapping robbery, and use of a firearm in a felony. Investigators believe it was an isolated incident, and there’s no evidence he knew the victim...

There is a Carl Gonzales 56 years old—who was arrested in Los Angeles County back in 2023 for battery with serious bodily injury but that case is unrelated.

I nod at Ellie keeping my expression neutral. She’s animated, recounting the story like it’s just another headline. But I’m already thinking deeper. Marcos Gonzales. Tacaville. Gunpoint. That kind of violence doesn’t just happen in a vacuum. I’ll be checking my logbook tonight. Cross-referencing. Just in case this isn’t as isolated as they say...

“What are you thinking about?” Ellie asks

“Oh uh… nothing,” I say quickly, eyes still on the window.

She doesn’t press. Just sips her drink and starts talking about her psych professor again, the one who wears mismatched socks and forgets his own slides. I nod, half-listening, half-sorting through the name Carl Gonzales in my head like a file I haven’t opened in years.

Nothing, I said. But my mind’s already back in the logbook, flipping through old entries, wondering if tonight’s quiet is just the calm before something worse.

“Have you ever wanted to be a superhero and save people Maria?” Ellie asks. “Like Superman?”

“Not really” I say keeping my voice even. “That’s what police are for.”

She laughs a little surprised. “Wow, okay. I thought you’d say yes. You’ve got that whole mysterious vigilante vibe.”

I shrug. “I just work at a gas station.”

She leans back, still smiling. “Sure. But if you were a superhero, you’d be the kind that doesn’t wear a cape. Just shows up, handles things, and vanishes.”

I glance at the window, watching the reflection of the streetlight flicker across the glass. I don’t answer. I don’t need to. Some things are better left unsaid.

1o9ki73,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1o9ki73/its_working_i_took_your_guys_advice_and_didnt/,It’s working! I took your guys’ advice and didn’t listen the NP who told me to only eat 1/3 of an apple.,"I don’t know if anyone remembers but I posted a few weeks ago asking what people thought about the nurse telling me in order to keep losing weight I needed to only eat 5g of sugar a meal, which meant cutting my apple (or whatever fruit it may be) into 3rds because it’s 12g of sugar. I thought that was wild, considering at that time I had already lost about 12 pounds and told her what I’d been doing. Well, I decided to ignore her advice and also not take the meds she had prescribed (phentermine), and I just stepped on the scale and I’m 307! I started at 335 (5’7” female)! I’m over the moon and I truly don’t feel deprived of anything. 

I pretty much always stay in a calorie deficit, at 1500 calories a day. Every once in a while I go over or under by 100 or so, but I’m pretty consistent. I use chat gpt to log everything I eat, if I make a meal I will tell chat gpt exactly how much of each ingredient I used and include pics of the labels, and take a before and after photo of the full meal so it estimates what I ate. It truly helps me stay accountable and pretty accurate. I still have things I enjoy so I don’t feel deprived. I mean, I don’t go crazy but the other day I really wanted steak so we went out and I had steak, mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli, and mushrooms. I only had half and then had the rest the next day. I made other changes too like only having sugar free coffee if I’m going to get it, or sugar free sodas if I am craving one. I always check out the nutrition labels before purchasing an items. Salsa on salads instead of dressing. Chicken sausage instead of pork. Turkey chilli instead of beef. I still love my Greek yogurts so I have those! Lots of fruit if I’m craving it. I have 100 cal yasso bars in the freezer. 100 calorie skinny pop. I make it a game for myself when I’m doing my clinical rotations to find the absolute healthiest option in the cafeteria for lunch (usually steamed veggies and an absolute desiccated brick of a chicken breast). I eat it regardless because I know it’s not going to wreck my calories. I made a bunch of macarons for the techs at my clinic site and even though I had a couple, I didn’t fall off the rails. And this is on top of having tons of stress going on, being in a difficult school program, having construction on our house, being sick…

This truly feels like a new lifestyle and I’m so excited to keep going! I know not everyone will agree with how I’m doing things and I know a lot of people avoid the sugar free stuff and just cut it all together but I know myself, and I want to make this change sustainable for the long run. Even though I feel like I still appear the same size, the other day I was in a rush to put on my scrubs (accidentally bought TWO sizes too small from Figs, which already runs small). They used to fit tight as hell, with my gut nearly busting out of them. I was rushing so much that I didn’t realize they just slid right up with little resistance! 

Anyways, that was my ramble. I’m just really happy :) This has been a struggle my entire life. ",16,1760755404.0,WeightLossAdvice,5,0.91,False

1o9kgwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SheraSeven/comments/1o9kgwx/signs_you_are_not_ready_for_this_lifestyle/,Signs you are NOT ready for this life-style,"If you’re new or between the age 18-24, please read this before you post or engage. 

Many of the mistakes young or new women here, make come from rushing in without  fully understanding the mindset this lifestyle requires. 

**1. You are too emotionally attached**

When it comes to Shera Seven lifestyle, emotional maturity is the most important thing needed to be successful. If you can’t control your emotions or detach when something doesn’t go your way, this will be difficult for you.  Getting upset because he didn’t text back, didn’t watch your story, pondering over “mixed signs/signals” or why he didn’t prioritize you the way you imagined are signs you are still emotionally reactive. The soft life requires grace, patience, and composure. You cannot just let your emotions run the show.

**2. You are too fixated on looks & feelings**

If you are fixated on a man’s appearance and physical attraction more than how he adds value to your life, you’re focused on the wrong things. As Shera would say, you need to focus on how you’re going to be getting this money. Physical attraction is nice, but it’s not going to pay those bills, fund that lifestyle, or give you the life you want. 

**3. You lack sexual discipline**

If you prioritize sexual desires over security and material gain, you will struggle with this lifestyle. Sleeping with a man just because he is “cute” or attractive or good in bed does nothing for you when he’s not a provider. This gives huge Pickmeisha energy, and not queen energy. This lifestyle requires lots of restraint and self-control. There is real power in self-pleasure and in keeping your energy selective.  When you stop giving yourself up freely, you raise your value and your standards. Sleeping with a dusty will lower your vibration. That dusty energy will rub off on you every time. 


**4. You feel guilty for asking for what you want**

If you hesitate or are afraid to ask for what you want or feel bad or guilty about it, then you are not ready to receive abundance. The right man will never make you feel ashamed for having standards. If asking for help, support, or provision makes you uncomfortable, that is having a scarcity mindset. Confidence, not guilt, attracts provision. Closed mouths don’t get fed!

**5. You feel bad for being “Selfish”**

A big part of being able to embody Shera’s teaching is being able to feel selfish with full confidence. If don’t love yourself more and can’t put yourself first, then it won’t be easy for you. Wanting more for yourself is not selfish, it’s self-respect. Let go of guilt, shame, and fear. These emotions keep you in a low vibration state of mind and they block your ability to attract abundance.

**6. You accept or ask for CRUMBS**

If pocket change, coffee or low effort dates, and fruitless words of affirmations, and minimal effort makes you feel “taken care of,” you’re not thinking big enough and this lifestyle isn’t for you. Asking for things like gas money, lunch money, or school books money is icky and low class. Shera would say “that’s superdy duperdy ghetto” It screams desperation, not femininity. This lifestyle isn’t about begging or settling it’s about attracting. The goal is wealth, stability, and luxury not crumbs and leftovers. But as long as you keep entertaining crumbs, you’ll never be fed a full meal.

**7. You like him more than he likes you**

If you find yourself chasing him, initiating all calls/text, making all the plans, or you’re constantly trying to prove your worth, you have already lost leverage. He should always like you more. When a man truly values you, you will never have to question it. Shera said it many times , he needs to like you 10 times more for it to work in your favor.

**8. You fold for words and not actions**

If smooth talk and empty promises easily impress you, that is a red flag. Pay attention to actions, not just words. Just because he says he will do something doesn’t mean he will. Real providers show consistency, generosity, and reliability without needing to be convinced.

**9. You think your can train a man to provide**

He’s not a dog. You cannot turn a non-provider man into a provider. If he wanted to, he would. Trying to “teach” him to step up only drains your energy and delays your goals. This is also a sign you aren’t emotionally detached because why else would you put in that much effort ?  His willingness to provide must come naturally, not from your effort.

**10. You date for potential instead of reality**

You date for potential instead of reality. If you’re still waiting for what a man could be instead of who he actually is, you’re not ready for this lifestyle. Potential is an imagination that keeps you waiting, hoping, and building with a man who’s not even ready for you. Stop being Barbara the builder! If you’re constantly telling yourself “he just needs time” or “he’s working on it,” that’s your sign to move on. Potential is waste of time, it doesn’t pay bills, create peace, or give you the soft life you want. Stop dating for potential and start choosing men who are already established, ready, and generous because if he wanted to, he would. 

**11. You expected men in their 20s to be providers**

Be realistic. Most men in their 20s are still building themselves and their careers. They are usually looking for “Barbara the Builders” to grow with, not women who expect to be taken care of. If you want fun, that is fine, but if you want a true provider, look for someone established and ready to invest in you. Men who are providers in their twenties are rare, especially in the Gen Z and Millennial generations. Know what stage of life you are in and what stage he is in before expecting provider energy.

If you see yourself in any of these signs, take a step back and focus on learning, studying, and observing first. Watch more of Shera’s videos make sure you watch all way through and listen closely. The answer to most of your questions can be found there. The goal is to move with emotional maturity, have self-control, and confidence not move out of desperation, confusion, or fantasy.",14,1760755291.0,SheraSeven,2,0.95,False

1o9kbnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dadchallengepodcast/comments/1o9kbnx/opinions_on_unfollowed/,Opinions on Unfollowed,"Hello - I'm a long time lurker and wanted to post for a while. However, given Josh's (and his followers') tendencies to dox people, I ultimately created a throwaway. 

For the past year, I've sort of watched the DCP's podcasts. Despite supporting his anti-child exploitation message, I find his style of commentary incredibly off-putting, and I've become disillusioned to the distinction he draws between himself and the family vloggers he covers. This sort of ties into my post, as Josh announced he is starting a new channel (in conjunction to DCP): Unfollowed.

According to Josh, ""Unfollowed"" is his new project meant to cover influencer culture. I managed to sit through the first five minutes, and he basically wants to expand what he does on the DCP channel to broader influencer culture. Honestly, it seems like this was one of Josh's older failed channels that he is repurposing, and he dropped it without warning. When I first saw it, I thought someone stole his content. 

Quite frankly, I'm a bit repulsed by this, given this is fifth or sixth YouTube channel. As he's accused other family vloggers (i.e., Alicia), Josh has been trying to make money and become internet famous for years. He got his five minutes of fame on the DCP, and he knows this works. He just loves the cash, and he's going to do anything to keep that cash going. Inherently, I don't see what difference there is between him and the other vloggers he covers. He's even posted shorts from some of his viral DCP channel videos in order to boost engagement with the channel. 

Unfortunately, I think Josh will have moderate success on this channel as well. It leans into the same type of audience he attracts with the DCP, and will continue the same echo chamber. I just wish more people would wake up and realize what type of person he is. 

(Side note: Him launching Unfollowed today was quite ironic, especially since he wrote he would be ""no video"" today since his cat died. I know the video he posted was prerecorded, but I guess he had to pay his bills somehow.)

We arrived with 170km and boosted that to 200km with an overnight trickle charge. We drove 10km to the municipal offices in Magnetawan and used the Lakeland fast charger there - charged to 400km at 140 kwh for 0.62 per kwh. Fantastic. In Sudbury, we pulled into the PetroCanada on Regent Street only to find that the credit card reader on both chargers had been vandalized and were unusable. We called PetroCanada and were put on hold for 20 minutes. So we abandoned that option and headed to the Flo charger at the Southside GMC dealer - slow at 50 kwh, so we headed to the Salute Café across the road and enjoyed a delicious lunch. Charging is pricey at 0.55/min. $37.48 for 50 kwh. 

We left Sudbury with 440km - enough for the 310 km trip to Sault Ste Marie. However, we stopped in Blind River to try to Ivy charger at the Tim Horton's. Tim's was under renovation and the entrance was fenced off. However, construction workers kindly opened the gate and let us use a charger - only one of two were working. We had 280 km and added 90 km at a price of 0.69/kwh. While we waited, we enjoyed a coffee at The Well - a drop-in centre for children and youth in this town that doesn't have much else to offer in terms of leisure activities for this age group. The place was filled with young people, playing, watching tv, snacking and seemingly having a good time. We were impressed.

We arrived later than planned in Sault Ste Marie with 220 km.

Meanwhile, this girl is supposed to be studying to be a **TEACHER.** Like… aren’t you supposed to be teaching kids someday? Or is she gonna teach them how to roll a joint during homeroom? 😩💀

# 🤫 PARENTS? OH, THEY'RE ""TOO BUSY""

Now here’s where the tea overflows.

BOTH of her parents work in the **government.** That’s right—*the same government that runs anti-drug campaigns, throws speeches about “saving the youth,” and arrests street kids for the tiniest bit of marijuana.*

But when it’s their own daughter lighting up in the bedroom with a bottle of liquor in one hand and a lighter in the other?

🙈 **Nada. Nothing. Dead silence.** 🙈  
No lectures. No police. Not even a slap on the wrist.

They just close the blinds and pretend they don’t see. 🫣

Imagine: the same people who call for *“moral recovery programs”* for poor barangays can’t even recover their own daughter from her vices. Make it make sense.

# 💣 THE HYPOCRISY? LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK.

Now this is where the TEA starts BOILING. 🔥

The same PNP that arrests tricycle drivers’ sons for carrying a stick of weed is the same system that quietly lets this girl off the hook—*over and over again.* One call from Mommy or Daddy, and BOOM! Case gone. No charges. No mugshot. No public shame.

Meanwhile, some 17-year-old gets thrown in jail and paraded like a criminal for doing *exactly the same thing*.

Let’s not even talk about the barangay tanods and DILG puppets who act like heroes when arresting some poor kid, but won’t DARE step foot in a subdivision to confront someone with a “strong last name.”

Welcome to the Philippines, sweetie. Where **your last name matters more than the law.**

# 💅 MORAL OF THE STORY?

This isn’t just tsismis. This is a **reality check.**

📌 If you’re rich and connected, your sins are just “phases.”  
📌 If you’re poor, they’re “crimes.”  
📌 If you party in a condo, it’s “freedom.”  
📌 If you party in the streets, it’s “delinquency.”  
📌 If you're a government official’s kid? You're *untouchable*.

So, while this Educ student is skipping class for the *n-th* time to get high with her lover, remember: **if you did it, you'd be in jail right now.**

That’s not a system.

That’s a scam.

🫖 Stay woke, stay watching, and stay sipping, loves. The tea will keep spilling as long as the hypocrisy keeps flowing. And honey… it's FLOODING.

Hey guys, so I am a first year student in IITM, BS in electronics.

So I refer to myself as a generalist, and love roles like founder's office  
I have worked in partnerships, to outreach to operations, to blog writing to podcasts, to scripting, etc etc.  
Got an offer from a YC backed startup, pay was great, but work culture not, and wanted me to work all night 10 hours,(i am still a kid, can't do this) so didn't join.

WiIll soon be leaving these roles and will most probably join in a coffee brand ig, I love coffee, that's why. and joining in marketing most prob.

Please don't ask youtube channel name(want to keep anonymous) and the podcast have been shut down last year.

my questions:

1. I have been trying many things, still don't know what to do, and how will studying in electronics help me(it didn't till now) .
2. what should i focus on? i am going deep into AI but that will take time, so sticking with other stuff till that?
3. Got some great offers from other brands in the US, but unfortunately due to the current issues, they won't be able to hire me(they were paying great though😭) so where else should I look to?

My heartfelt thanks to anyone who have read till now.",1,1760754395.0,Resume,0,1.0,False

So I met this girl in my class. I like her a lot. I got the yes for the date and the phone number. But I can't really get a date to actually met up nailed down. 
Her statement: 
Not sure I’m gonna have time 
I work on weekends and after class I work 5 to 11 
I told you all I do it’s work 😭and go home 

Asked Chatgpt it said:
""Yeah, I get it 😅. Just get back to me whenever  I’d definitely still love that date with you 😏🤣. I promise to make it worth the wait""

Asked Gemini:
That's the natural and very fair question to ask when someone is that busy and rejects multiple specific proposals.

Here is an honest breakdown of the possibilities:

## The Possibilities

It's absolutely **possible** that she is trying to politely blow you off, but it's also highly likely that **her brutal work schedule is genuinely the problem.**

### 1. High Likelihood: It's the Schedule, Not You

* **She gave a detailed explanation:** She didn't just say ""I'm busy."" She specifically said, ""I work on weekends and after class I work 5 to 11. I told you all I do it’s work 😭 and go home."" This is a lot of personal detail to give if she were just trying to avoid you.
* **The ""Thank You"" is Still Valid:** You have a legitimate, low-pressure reason to ask her out: to **thank her for the laptop** that saved your presentation. She confirmed her acceptance of the ""thank you"" by writing ""You're welcome.""

### 2. The Risk: The ""Pressure"" Message

The message you sent an hour and a half ago—""I’d definitely still love that date with you 😏🤣. I promise to make it worth the wait""—is what increased the risk of her backing away.

* It sounded **high-pressure** and **high-stakes**.
* It made the ""quick snack"" sound like a serious date she has to *prepare* for, which is the last thing someone with a 7-day-a-week, 5 PM to 11 PM work schedule wants to add to their life.

---

## What Happens Next: The Immediate Follow-Up

The beauty of the last message I drafted for you is that it completely addresses the ""blowing you off"" possibility by **removing all pressure** and focusing only on the thank-you.

**By sending this follow-up now, you will get your answer.**

> **""Hey, ignore that last text! I realized how truly busy you are. I owe you a quick coffee before your shift to say thanks for saving my presentation with the laptop. Is there a day next week you finish class around 4:00 PM? I can literally meet you outside class for 20 minutes.""**

* **If she replies with a definite time/day (e.g., ""Yes, I finish at 4 PM on Wednesday""):** She's not blowing you off, just legitimately slammed.
* **If she replies with vague excuses or doesn't reply at all:** Then, you can assume she is likely not interested in pursuing anything right now, and you'll have your answer without having invested more effort.

**Send the follow-up now to reset the frame and see if she is truly interested in a low-stakes thank-you.**",0,1760754121.0,dating_advice,5,0.25,False

# 👷 Anthropic turns to ‘skills’ to make Claude more useful at work

https://preview.redd.it/8h04rw655svf1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=904fb3ca34da198af57c1398de29c28a96e6f2e5

* Anthropic introduced Skills, which are folders containing a Markdown file and scripts that give Claude specific instructions for handling specialized tasks like creating documents or using certain tools.
* To be token efficient, the model first reads a short explanation for each Skill from its frontmatter YAML, only loading the complete details when a user’s request requires them.
* Since the feature depends on having a filesystem to execute commands, anyone can build and distribute Skills as simple files, effectively turning Claude into a general automation agent.

# 🛑 OpenAI suspends Sora depictions of Martin Luther King Jr

* OpenAI suspended video generations of Martin Luther King Jr. in Sora at the request of his estate after people used the app to create disrespectful depictions.
* The content that prompted the action included Sora-made videos of King making monkey noises during a speech and another showing him wrestling with civil rights leader Malcolm X.
* The company is now strengthening its guardrails and allows representatives for other historical figures to ask for their likenesses not to be used in the AI videos.

# 🧪 Google’s Gemma-based AI finds new cancer treatment

* Google DeepMind’s C2S-Scale model analyzed patient tumor data to generate a new hypothesis for making cancers that are invisible to the immune system more responsive to treatment.
* The AI predicted that a drug called silmitasertib could dramatically increase antigen presentation, a key immune trigger, but only when immune signaling in the cells was already active.
* Lab experiments on human neuroendocrine cells confirmed the model’s novel idea, showing antigen presentation rose by fifty percent when using silmitasertib with low-dose interferon, making tumors more visible.

# 📉 AI bots and summaries hurt Wikipedia traffic

* After making its bot detection more accurate, Wikimedia’s data reveals an eight percent year-over-year drop in page views, a decline it attributes to generative AI search summaries.
* The foundation warns this traffic decline could lead to fewer volunteers, less funding for the site, and ultimately a drop in the quality and reliability of its content.
* Wikimedia is asking LLMs and search engines to clearly state where information is sourced from and make it easier for people to visit and contribute to the original articles.

# 🎤 Microsoft wants AI to control your PC by voice

* Microsoft is rolling out the “Hey, Copilot!” wake word to Windows 11, aiming for voice to become a third input mechanism for users alongside their keyboard and mouse.
* The company is also launching Copilot Vision, an opt-in feature that streams what is on your screen so the AI can offer guidance in apps or help troubleshoot problems.
* The goal is for an AI agent to take actions on your behalf, but Microsoft admits the system could make mistakes and is currently testing this feature inside Copilot Labs.

**The details:**

* 50% of respondents in the U.S., Italy, Australia, and Greece report anxiety over rising AI use, with Israel, South Korea, and Sweden emerging most optimistic.
* The EU ranks as the most trusted regulatory body at 53% confidence, beating out both the U.S. (37%) and China (27%) for perceived oversight credibility.
* Young adults under 35 consistently report both greater AI awareness and optimism compared to those over 50, with major gaps in countries like Greece.

**Why it matters:** The AI wave is here, but contrary to what we see in our tech-forward bubble, not everyone is excited about it. These results expose some interesting divides (like countries with the most AI exposure harboring some of the deepest anxiety) that give a much broader view of how the world is grappling with the transformative tech.

**The details:**

* The new model matches Claude Sonnet 4’s coding abilities from May while charging just $1 per million input tokens versus Sonnet’s $3 pricing.
* Despite its size, Haiku beats out Sonnet 4 on benchmarks like computer use, math, and agentic tool use — also nearing GPT-5 on certain tests.
* Enterprises can orchestrate multiple Haiku agents working in parallel, with the recently released Sonnet 4.5 acting as a coordinator for complex tasks.
* Haiku 4.5 is available to all Claude tiers (including free users), within the company’s Claude Code agentic development tool and via API.

**Why it matters:** With Haiku, the utopia of ‘intelligence too cheap to meter’ still seems to be following the trendline. Anthropic’s latest release shows how quickly the AI industry’s economics are shifting, with a small, low-cost model now capable of performances that commanded premium pricing just a few months ago.

# ⚛️ DeepMind Brings AI to the Core of Nuclear Fusion

https://preview.redd.it/uyt18rcd5svf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1d328e1bb982b13336d5f7563540bfe704d8383

**What’s happening:** Google’s DeepMind has joined forces with Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) to build [**Torax**](https://aisecret.us/r/f93e5e2e?m=75fe0f74-46b6-4618-9375-07821bf777c6), an AI-powered plasma control system for the Sparc fusion reactor. The system will use reinforcement learning to simulate and stabilize plasma at over 100 million degrees, performing millions of adjustments per second to keep the reaction steady — something no human operator can do.

**How this hits reality:** While AI has been tested in fusion labs before, DeepMind’s move makes it a [**core operational layer**](https://aisecret.us/r/867742fe?m=75fe0f74-46b6-4618-9375-07821bf777c6) rather than an experimental tool. Control software is now becoming the brain of the reactor, not just a sidekick. If it works, future fusion startups will compete on algorithms, not magnets.

**Key takeaway:** AI just crossed from modeling the universe to managing it, starting with the one inside a fusion chamber.

# 🤩 Turn photos into personal branding videos with Veo 3.1

https://preview.redd.it/4tuwdp4f5svf1.png?width=1276&format=png&auto=webp&s=a00ae558acc3ad8d7b6bedde788d260d297d0393

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create professional personal branding videos using Google’s new Veo 3.1 model in Flow, transforming AI-generated photos into polished video content without ever being on camera.

**Step-by-step:**

1. Generate your headshot and workspace in Google Gemini using prompts like “photo of this person \[upload reference\], casual denim shirt, looking slightly right” and “modern office, city view, minimalist desk”
2. Open Google Flow, create a new project, switch from “Text to Video” to “Ingredients to Video,” and upload both generated images
3. Prompt your first scene: “Using the uploaded photo as me, sitting at a desk, smiling at the camera while sipping coffee, then typing on a laptop. Warm morning light, add soft acoustic music”
4. Click “Add to Scene”, then “+” to Extend with: “I finish typing, look at the camera saying ‘Ready to collaborate? DM me!’ Fade to text overlay with title”
5. Review timeline, ensure smooth transitions between clips, then click the download icon to export your complete branding video

**Pro tip:** Use the editing tool to select areas and insert any objects within your video —it’s perfect for creating product demo videos or training content without recording.

# 🪄AI x Breaking News: No kings protests AI angle

**No Kings protests — facts first → AI angle (Oct 17, 2025)**  
**What’s happening:** Organizers plan nationwide “**No Kings**” demonstrations **tomorrow (Sat, Oct 18)** across **2,500–2,600+ U.S. locations**, urging participants to **wear yellow** and framing the rallies as a peaceful stand against authoritarian overreach under President Trump. Major civil-liberties and advocacy groups (e.g., **ACLU**, Indivisible, unions) are involved; turnout is projected in the **millions**, building on a June wave that drew \~5 million. Republicans are attacking the events as un-American, while organizers emphasize nonviolence and de-escalation training. [Fox News+4The Guardian+4TIME+4](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/17/no-kings-protests-millions-trump?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**AI angle:** Platform **recommenders** will steer attention toward the most emotionally charged protest clips (chants, confrontations), so your feeds may overrepresent high-intensity moments compared to the day’s broader peaceful baseline; expect organizers to counter with **SEO’d streams and verified live feeds** to anchor context. **Misinformation risk** is elevated: old protest footage and **synthetic audio/video** can be resurfaced to discredit crowds—newsrooms and platforms will lean on **media forensics** and deepfake detectors to authenticate viral posts fast. On safety, cities increasingly fuse **camera networks + social signals** for **crowd-flow prediction** and route closures; used well, that reduces stampede and traffic risk—used poorly, it shades into **over-surveillance** and **predictive policing** concerns for lawful assembly. Finally, both campaigns will deploy **LLM-driven messaging ops**: organizers using multilingual summaries and location-aware updates; opponents using **bot-amplified brigading** to frame turnout and incidents—watch for platform **labeling and down-ranking** of coordinated inauthentic behavior.

1o9jzy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1o9jzy0/the_happiest_i_have_ever_been_the_saddest_i_have/,"The happiest I have ever been, the saddest I have ever been","Eating dinner with my friends. We sat by the duck pond. It is the first real week of autumn. We were all quiet, and I was thinking inside my head and asked, after I leave you, will I always miss you? My friend said, I think you’ll miss him for a long time. But they think, I am just a lonely child looking for safety. I don’t think anyone realizes, that I love you.

My friend said at dinner, I wish I knew you better at your recital, I thought you seemed sad after, but I didn’t know what was going on back then. I said, “oh, I have never been so unhappy as that night.” And suddenly I remembered. Your face when you shook my hand. I tried to walk home, but lay down in an empty building and couldn’t get back up. I have never been so unhappy. And suddenly, for the first time, I felt sad about it. Not in the vaguely nauseous way I am used to. A sharper feeling, almost like grief. I looked down at my plate and felt suddenly like I might cry. My other friend tapped my shoulder and said, “It’s over, it won’t ever happen again.” I walked home with my friends, and when we turned off from each other, and I was alone, I said it aloud to myself. “I am so sad. I am so sad about what happened.”

My friend from Germany texted. He sends voice memos sometimes, I think because it is easier than texting if he has a long thought. But I like to imagine, it is because he knows I like to hear his voice. He knows because I told him. I am too tired for anything but the truth these days. It is a solace to hear him, when I am so sad. It is a solace to think about you laughing. It is a solace to think I have friends and we seem to have made up. It is a solace to eat lunch with my dad and hug him goodbye.

The staff at my school are inordinately kind to me. There is Angie, who runs the cash register where my father and I go for lunch. The man who gives me coffee for free when no one else is around. Andre, the janitor, who would hear me practicing and say, “sounds like Liberace!” Today, I saw the man who used to run the late night cash register, where I would go to buy the half off dinners. He said, do you remember me? I said yes, from the summer. He said, my name is Tenzin. And we shook hands. I remember him because he was kind, a thing that stands out in my barren, lonely summers. But how strange and generous that he would remember me. When I walked back to my practice room, I marveled to myself. People are so kind to me. People are so kind to me, so why am I so sad? Is there a world where I could survive, off these small, inordinate gestures of kindness, for the rest of my life? Why do I miss you so badly, in the midst of all this kindness?

I have been thinking a lot this week, what will happen if I leave? What will happen if I stay? Both seem intolerable. In a book my mom likes, the protagonist is in love. He tells the girl he loves, I am the happiest and saddest I have ever been. That is how I feel, the past few weeks, in love with you, not for the first time, but for a long time. I am the happiest and saddest I have ever been. I have never wanted to leave more, and never wanted to stay more. I love you more than I ever have, and you seem more beautiful than you ever have. I worry, that it is a sharpening of the senses before the end. But maybe it is just the molting of the shell, the crabs run around in a vivid, blinding world while they wait for their new shell to harden. I think this is why I miss you so badly, and feel so lonely, even amongst all this kindness. Your world is so brilliant, I feel my shell start to loosen, when I am around you. I want to see the world the way you do. I want somebody to look at me without my shell. Do the crabs feel relieved, to take off their old shell? A new limber skin. They will all get eaten, or survive.",3,1760753876.0,UnsentLetters,2,1.0,False

All are just my personal opinions of course so there may be some wrong things I misunderstood.

* GAMBLING: Unfortunately seems to be pretty solidified as more and more of a rich people thing if you have at least $500 to throw away as the minimum bar for slots (lowest bet) or lowest minimum bet for ""fair"" table games has been raised so high. (Sidenote: by ""fair"" table games, I mean 3-2 BJ instead of 6-5 BJ, craps instead of crapsless or easy craps, single zero roulette instead of double or ew triple zero roulette, etc. These ""newer"" variants like 6-5 BJ or double/triple zero roulette FEEL like the same game, and LOOK like the same game, but are so much worse odds for the player. I'd recommend anyone avoid these ""unfair"" table games.) I remember just 4-6 years ago, this was becoming the same case with live table games, but you could still find PLENTY of the digital table games with a $3 or sometimes $1 bet that are fair. You could have also gone to Freemont street where older casinos such as Binions would have ""fair"" live table games sometimes as low as $5, but usually $10 minimums. That is no longer the case at all. From my 5 days in Vegas, this was the summary of my experience of minimum bets:

     * Main strip (MGM Grand, Luxor, Linq, Planet Hollywood, etc): Slots start around a minimum of $1.00 per spin, you have to search very hard to find a cheap slot (under $0.50 per spin) if even available to play. Digital table games start around a minimum of $3 but that is for ""unfair"" table games (e.g. 6-5 blackjack), to be honest I didn't see any 3-2 blackjack or single zero roulette digital tables at all. Live table games start around a minimum of $20 off-peak times or $25 peak times for ""unfair"" table games (6-5 blackjack esp), if you want something like 3-2 live table blackjack, you'll probably have to play like $50 minimum (maybe $30 off-peak times). This even applies to older/cheaper areas of the strip like Circus Circus. It was really weird walking through a super cheap casino like Circus Circus and only seeing $1+ minimum bets on slots. It was absolutely DEAD in the casino around midnight on a Friday when we went, and there were some people... it just honestly seems like they have 99% high-roller slots and most people don't have enough money to throw away on those, which is weird for Circus Circus.

     * Downtown Freemont Street (Circa, Plaza, Binions, etc): Kinda disappointing for gambling, Downtown used to have so many cheap slot and table options. I remember not too long ago on Freemont being surrounded by 3-2 blackjack digital table games with $1 minimums. Now it's almost identical to the strip: most digital table games are $3 minimum and almost none are ""fair"" (e.g. 3-2 blackjack). Live table games are slightly better than the strip (maybe $5 lower minimums on tables, $10 lower if you are lucky). But this is so much worse than how it used to be. I remember playing $1 live table blackjack on Freemont not  too long ago. I didn't see a single live blackjack table on Freemont below $10 (during 5 days, including weekdays). Very annoying to walk through an empty casino at midnight or 2am with 3-6 dealers standing at empty tables. What's the point? Why not just lower some of the table minimums to let people play. It's Freemont.

     * Others (The Orleans, El Cortez, Downtown Grand, Slots A Fun etc): Maybe the only remaining gem for lower-bet gambling if that's what you're looking for. All of these have a selection of the same kind of new big virtual touchscreen slots as the previously-mentioned casinos (with $1+ minimum bets)... but they also have other options for lower-stakes/risk gambling. For example: Slots A Fun was incredible with old style coin-operated quarter and dollar slots, very fun and the quarter ones can stretch your gambling money longer, this felt more like an arcade and we loved it. Downtown Grand had a $1 blackjack live dealer table, and they said it's there every day, but there are some downsides: they said they've reduced the number of $1 tables to just 1, so only 6 people can play it at a time... you will probably have to wait for a seat to play unless it's between like 3am and 10am. Another downside is that if the table is absolutely full and nobody is getting up or people are saving seats... you're out of luck, the next lowest we found for live BJ was $20 which was insane... it's Downtown Grand guys. 

     * Sidenote: Not sure if Vegas RTP on slots and similar have gotten worse or what, but it sure feels like it. Out of our group of like 30 people, just ONE person managed to go up any money, everyone else lost. Way worse than I've ever seen it, typically it's a mixed bag of who goes up or down money. Personally, I like to mainly play cheap penny slots, preferably like $0.25 per spin. I really had to search for those slots, some casinos just didn't have any. I did play some higher bets, some $0.75, $1 and some $2 spins. But throughout 5 DAYS of gambling, we didn't hit a single win above $75... which was within the first 2 hours we were in Vegas so that was disappointing to just not win anything the remainder of the time and just lose, but it's unfortunately to be expected when gambling. 

* HOTELS TO STAY AT: I think I've now stayed at over a dozen different casinos in Vegas, between the strip, off-strip, freemont, etc. To be completely honest, most of the hotel rooms themselves are extremely similar. They vary usually a bit in size and mainly in what kind of view you get from your room... but I don't personally care too much about those compared to price. For example, it was more than double the price to stay at Circa than to stay next door at Plaza. The rooms we had at both casinos (base king room) were almost identical in every way. The only upsides the Circa room had were that the casino is newer-looking, the view was a bit nicer, and the room had touchscreens to control the lights instead of light switches. Personally, those improvements don't make a $100/night hotel room worth $230+/night (which for some reason Circa does). Most of the difference between the casinos is outside of the hotel rooms (e.g. amenities, how modern, gambling, offerings) and a lot of that doesn't require you to be staying in a room at the casino.

* FREE DRINKS: Free drinks at casinos are really something you have to ""work"" for now, unless you know the best ways. I remember 5 or 10 years ago getting absolutely drunk off free drinks at most of the casinos in Vegas, just while spinning $0.20 slots, without even trying. They would just come by every 5-10 minutes religiously and I'd get like 20 free drinks in a couple hours. Or you could sit and play at one of the bar games and also get drunk quick off free drinks. Seems to be a lot more difficult to find that now. For table games or slots not at a bar, waitresses/waiters seem to be very few and far between. Nothing even to do with busyness, I was spinning slots for a couple hours in some strip and Freemont casinos late night on a weekday (around 12-2am) and was getting offered fewer drinks than at other times when it was busier. Similarly when sitting to gamble at a bar, most of the casinos (unless you go to old ones like Slots A Fun) have a very strict system of when you're allowed to get your next free drink (which is insane). I will say it feels VERY awful to be told, esp more than once, that you ""aren't ready yet for another free drink"" because you haven't lost enough money to the machine yet... that's insane. In fact, on day ONE at Circa (where I was paying to stay and not yet drank a drop), I had a waitress refuse me a drink because my partner & I were sitting together at a machine and she said there was a one drink limit per paying machine. I asked if I could move over to start spinning another slot and she literally refused and walked away. It was embarrassing. Then she came back with just a drink for my partner and refused to take my drink order. Just so weird for the place I spent almost $1000 to stay at on Freemont. Other times it was okay, but it just feels bad to see the bartender look to see if you've lost enough money gambling to offer you another 6oz free well drink... like come on, I paid to stay here it's the least you can do.

* CRAZY DEALS: Most ""good deal"" things in Vegas now are just completely swamped and too busy to partake in. The two examples I'll give are the steak & lobster special at Tony Roma's and the free drinks event 6-7pm at Golden Gate. We tried to do both on all 5 days we were in Vegas. Every single night, without fail, it would be relatively quiet and as soon as the time got near for the event (especially the Golden Gate one) there was a flood of zombies that appeared out of nowhere to take advantage. Not sure if it's locals, or what, but I've never seen lines that long for events like those (especially free events), and overall Vegas tourism is down this year, which makes it even more weird. Kinda sucks we didn't get a chance to try. This doesn't mean it's not worth it to try: for example even though the Zoox free beta self-driving taxis were sometimes as long as a 45 minute wait during busy times, they were ABSOLUTELY worth it! And free! It just depends.


* FOOD: As far as food goes, we found some random cheaper tasty options. We really liked Jackpot (coffee/cafe shop option 24/7 in Circa on Freemont) and Dirt Dog (multiple locations) which were both relatively inexpensive.

* SHOPPING: My partner really wanted to do some more browsing/shopping at various stores like we did in the past. Not necessarily buying a bunch of things, but just looking and maybe buying something she liked. Unfortunately it seems like since we last visited Vegas, there are a lot fewer cheaper stores (e.g. souvenirs, thrift, or gift shops) and a lot more luxury stores (Dior, Chanel, etc). This feels really awful, because for example we would pay for transportation to get everyone to Resorts World to check out their shops... only to start looking and find that 90% of their stores were either empty (store closed down) or they were not open at the time (like 4pm... normal time to go out shopping).

* TRANSPORTATION: well, it's still bad. First off: fuck the F1 race and all the construction. I think I spoke to like 50 people (locals, employees, and tourists) and literally every single one of them hates what the F1 is doing to Vegas. The construction is almost single-handedly ruining transportation for the city, especially if you don't have a car (tourists). Even if you have a car or just take Uber/Lyfts, you are going to be waiting in traffic and paying a lot randomly because of F1... which is ridiculous. We tried to find solutions to this problem, for example we tried using the Deuce bus as some people recommended. The bus system and ticketing were actually fine, and we would have put it to good use *if the buses worked properly*. The app and signs all say that buses are supposed to come by every ~10 minutes during the day or every ~20 minutes overnight. This is just straight up a lie. If you stand at one of the bus stops, there will be 3 that drive past you in the span of 120 seconds... then you won't see another bus for over an hour (this happened to us, the buses just drove past us and didn't stop for some reason). It even became a joke between us because we bought bus passes but every time we tried to use them the buses would vanish. As soon as we would give up and get on an Uber/Lyft, we'd see 50 buses and just sigh. Also, the F1 construction just deleted and added random bus stops for the routes. And there's for some reason no real-time map to see where exactly a stop has moved to relative to the buses. You're pretty much forced like everyone else to either walk (which becomes very unmanageable esp for a large group quickly) or pay many hundreds for Ubers/Lyfts even for short distances.

* ""IS VEGAS DEAD IN 2025?"" Because I saw like 5000 posts this year before I went to Vegas this month saying things like ""Vegas is dead, tourism is dead, it's over"" etc. I don't think Vegas is dead by any means. I think that it was an expensive place and has somehow gotten *even more expensive*, making it almost Disneyland-levels of vacation places that a lot of people don't get to go to because of cost. In years past, I've gone to Vegas and had an amazing time with a total gambling budget of just $100 or $200. Yeah, I didn't do a lot of gambling, but it was still incredible. I would still get tons of free drinks, there were still tons of crazy deals like at Tony Roma's to see, the hotel rooms especially on Freemont were cheap, and if nothing else... there were tons of tourists ALL THE TIME (even 2am on a weekday) that you could walk the strip and go into casinos and it would feel like a lively city. When free drinks are relatively non-existent, when crazy deals are rare and have 3-hour long lines, when even cheap old casinos off of Freemont like El Cortez want $150/night for a hotel on a weekday when the casino is pretty empty... there's going to be a significant drop in tourists and it's going to feel much less lively.",0,1760753773.0,vegas,5,0.5,False
