Here comes down two guests, I'm assuming husband and wife, i assume for coffee as it is 5 am.

Me: ""good morning!""

Them: ""good morning"" they turn down the hallway before the coffee room which is the way to the pool, which doesn't open till 8am.

I'm not really thinking much of it, I'm just continuing with my tasks, they come back in and approach the desk

Wife: ""the pool opens at 6 right?""

Me: I smile, ""oh no, it opens at 8""

They look perplexed as if there isn't a giant blue sign right behind me that says POOL HOURS ""8am to 10pm""

Husband: ""oh well they usually let us in early, besides we're just going to the Jacuzzi"" 

Me: I have no idea who ""they"" is and am I supposed to know who these people are? ""well that's just the policy Sir, it doesn't open til 8"" I point to the sign behind me

Wife: ""is that new?""

Me: ""no ma'am""

Wife starts to walk away

Husband: huffs and sighs ""I'll have to talk to someone about this"" 

Me: ""alright then"" confused asf and unsure if what just happened actually happened or if I'm just that sleep deprived.

So I matched with a guy back in  beginning of December, we chatted on the app for a bit then moved to IG. He asked to go to go out and I said it's a super busy period for me multiple birthdays, a small vacation away and Christmas. We're also from 2 different cities, I'm 1.5 hour away from him. He was okay with that and I was like maybe after Christmas I'll come up, it's super easy one/2 trains depending on the station I drive to.

We continued to chat sending pictures of our day etc, etc how we're doing etc normal chat basically, never gone over 24 hours without a reply seemed good, I was enjoying chatting to him.

fast forward I said I was coming up to the city in a week. Now I haven't had a reply in 4 days. 

I know a month is a long time to not meet up, but I did explain the situation and he seemed okay with that and never pushed about meeting again.. maybe I should've taken that as a sign and I was just being a filler for him and now that I said I was going to be nearer he's gone.

 I was in the mindset if I did meet him I would've been happy to go up to the city more and make that effort, but I also didn't want to make the journey for nothing so having something else to do in the city as well made a good time to meet in case in person it wasn't a vibe and the journey wasn't wasted for a    coffee meeting or something ( I don't believe in spending a lot on 1st dates for either person) ha

 but I guess maybe I was wishful thinking he was okay with the distance, but then don't set your radar that far out then.  only 1.5 hours with easy transport.

I aim to release Legacy Looper before summer on PC, Mac and Deck, in a completed, bug-free state (as much as is humanly possible!). No early-access builds that you have to wait ages to get the bugs fixed on. When you pay for the game, you get the whole game - no microtransactions either... ever!

How does the game work?

You start off as a simple adventurer (can you tell I'm a massive D&D fan?) who fights monsters and levels up their attributes to collect gold to be able to face bigger threats. You can leave a Legacy to future generations, which resets your progress but gives substantial gains to future combats and attributes. 
Gold can be used to unlock upgrades which boost various aspects of your gameplay.
Eventually you will unlock the ability to enter a new Era (previously named Eternities), leaving your legacy behind and starting your lineage completely anew, where you gain a permanent currency called Essence. 
Essence unlocks new content, powerful boosts and some quality of life upgrades. Through gaining achievements and accolades for your deeds, you will eventually gain the ability to enter Class Challenges, which change the base gameplay, giving boons and banes which you must use to your advantage to progress in a new way. Progression in Class Challenges lets you level up these Classes, unlocking combat abilities which you can use in difficult boss fights.

1i3epdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i3epdq/to_anyone_whos_heartbroken_and_struggling_right/,To anyone who’s heartbroken and struggling right now—this is for you,"When I broke up with my ex, I was desperate for something—anything—that could alleviate the overwhelming pain. I searched endlessly for voices that would validate my feelings, but everywhere I looked, I found advice telling me to move on, to stop caring because they didn’t deserve me, or to focus on finding someone new. Now, maybe I can be this voice for someone else.

I DID NOT want someone new. I wasn’t ready to let go of everything we had.
We were together for years, and he was my home. I met him when I was sixteen, never had good relationship with my parents. He gave me the safety and care I had always craved, and with him came a whole world: his parents treated me like a daughter, his grandparents cooked for me almost every day, and even the neighborhood cat would come to his house looking for me so I could pet him.

When I lost him, I lost all of it. It felt like my whole world had been ripped away, and I was drowning in grief. I felt like one of those dogs that die from despair after losing their owner.

For the first week, I couldn’t get out of bed. I screamed into my pillow until my voice gave out, hurled things at the walls, and cried so much it felt like I’d never stop. I couldn’t eat and lost eight kilos in no time. I couldn't even pay attention to binge-watching TV series.

Here’s what I wish someone had told me back then: 

It’s okay to go insane. Just come back.

My life now is better than ever. It's been seven months, and I can say I'm proud of myself and my grieving process. Thanks to it, I've let it all out and didn’t bottle up my emotions. Day by day, it became easier to get over it.

NOW, dear readers - I would like to share some advice that helped me through this process. I know it’s probably not groundbreaking, but maybe it will help someone.


1. Make a list of all their bad qualities. Every single one. Write down the bad things they did to you—everything that made you angry, sad, disgusted, or ashamed. Even the tiniest details, like the fact that they snored while sleeping, or the big ones, like cheating on you. This is extremely important! Over time, your brain tends to forget the bad memories and starts glamorizing the good ones. If nostalgia ever hits and you’re tempted to call them, go through the list. Remind yourself why you broke up in the first place. It’s all about discipline.


2. Reach out to your support network. Even if it feels like the hardest thing in the world, ask for help. You need it right now. Spend time with friends, call your loved ones whenever you need to, and, if possible, move in with family or friends for a while. Let people take care of you. From my experience, healing is a team effort. If it weren’t for my friends, I wouldn’t have made it through.


3. Seek therapy if you can afford it. Even just a few sessions can work wonders. Talking to someone who isn’t emotionally involved can help you gain a fresh perspective and process your emotions. And if you have a history of depression, seriously consider seeing a psychiatrist. My depression hit rock bottom after my breakup, and I needed to double my medication dosage to cope. Don’t hesitate to take care of your mental health—it’s crucial.


4. Start a journal and vent. Sometimes, you’ll need to get things off your chest, but no one will be around. To avoid texting your ex, write it all down. Write long, dramatic letters full of despair if you must—just DO NOT SEND THEM. Keep them for yourself, burn them, or flush them down the toilet. It’s surprisingly therapeutic. I recommend journaling daily—it completely transformed my grieving process. It helped me organize my thoughts and, over time, I could see my progress. Watching yourself heal, little by little, is incredibly empowering.


5. Let yourself feel awful. Cry, scream, lay in bed all day, throw up if you need to. This is your time to feel everything. And please, don’t stress about your diet right now, just eat something. Even if it’s french fries with ketchup every day, that’s fine. Just eat and drink plenty of liquids: water, tea, coffee, juice, electrolytes—whatever works. If you have the energy, take a shower. Showers are a blessing. Also, change your bed sheets often and wear fresh clothes. Wash your face and brush your teeth morning and evening. It may sound small, but it makes a big difference.


6. DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL. I’m dead serious. Don’t even think about it. I will personally show up at your house and flush it all down the toilet if I have to. Alcohol is a depressant, and it messes with the part of your brain responsible for self-control. The chances of you calling your ex after a drink are sky-high. So, just don’t. Trust me on this one. It won't make you feel better nor help with a healing process. If you want feel nostalgic, instead of drinking wine, just smoke a cigarette and listen to lana del rey while looking through the window. Works the same.


7. DO NOT SLEEP AROUND or use dating apps to find someone else to fill the void. Doing this won’t allow you to grow or properly grieve. You need time to reflect on the situation and understand why things went wrong. If you don’t, you’ll just repeat the toxic patterns that caused your last relationship to fall apart, or the reasons you chose a toxic partner in the first place. You deserve gentle love, but to find it, you need to heal first. Learn to live alone and spend time with yourself. I’ve heard stories of people finding someone special right after a breakup, but we don’t know the full story of how their relationship actually functions. The chances of that happening for you are slim, but the risk of falling into a vicious cycle is huge. Just don’t. People who say that sleeping around healed them are lying to themselves.


8. Watch TED talks and listen to podcasts about breakups. Someone who will lecture you non-stop like a parent taking care of you works. If I have any polish speakers here I higly recommend ""Ja i moje przyjaciółki idiotki"". 

This TED talk have 10 milion views but if any chance you didnt watch it, it also have been helpful.

https://youtu.be/k0GQSJrpVhM?si=r6YzS7Q8MwJrLaYw


9. If you're on a stage when you can get out of bed. Move your body! I've personally signed up myself for a gym and it was one of the best decisions. Physical activity triggers the release of endorphins, these neurotransmitters help reduce pain and stress while promoting feelings of happiness.


10. Start exploring your interest! Sometimes we're so deep involved in our relationship we loose ourselves. What did you like during childhood? What excited you? Don’t overwhelm yourself by thinking you need to jump into a complex hobby right away. Begin with something small and simple. Focus your attention on something else.


I know you feel like crap right now. Believe me, time heals the pain. Take care! I'm sending hugs. Have a lovely day.

1i3eo3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/himalayastrip/comments/1i3eo3i/trekking_to_annapurna_base_camp_in_january_a/,Trekking to Annapurna Base Camp in January: A Guide to Off-Season Exploration,"# Why Consider Annapurna Base Camp Trek in January?

Annapurna Base Camp Trek is a remarkable adventure that leads to the world's 10th base camp of Mount Annapurna with stunning numerous peaks with charming Gurung culture. January might not be the first month that comes to mind when planning a [trek to Annapurna Base Camp](https://www.nepalhightrek.com/activities/annapurna-base-camp-trek/) (ABC), but it offers a unique and rewarding experience for adventurous souls. Usually, January is a winter season the temperature will drop in -25 degrees celsius. If you are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in January you should well prepare for trekking geaars. However, in January the weather will be clear with blue skies and less crowded that you feel extremely peace. After Sinuwa some tea houses will be closed due to cold that before head to Annapurna Base Camp you should concerns about the local guest hosues.

First and foremost, the tranquility of the trails during this time is unparalleled. With fewer tourists around, we can immerse ourselves in the raw beauty of the Himalayas without the bustling crowds that characterize peak seasons. This solitude allows for a more intimate connection with nature and the local culture, as we traverse through quaint villages and pristine landscapes.

Moreover, January treks often come with reduced costs. Many tea houses and lodges offer discounted rates during this period, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious travelers. The quieter trails also mean we have a better chance of securing our preferred accommodations without the need for advance bookings, adding flexibility to our itinerary.

# Weather Conditions and Challenges During Winter Trek

The[ 7 Days Annapurna Base Camp Trek](https://www.nepalhightrek.com/activities/7-days-annapurna-base-camp-trek/) in January presents us with a set of unique weather conditions that both challenge and enchant. The winter months bring crisp, clear skies that offer breathtaking views of the Annapurna range. These crystal-clear vistas are a photographer's dream, providing unobstructed shots of the majestic peaks that are often shrouded in clouds during other seasons.

However, we must be prepared for the cold. Daytime temperatures can hover around freezing, while nighttime lows can plummet well below zero. This extreme cold is one of the primary challenges we'll face, requiring careful planning and appropriate gear. The trails can also be icy or snow-covered, especially at higher altitudes, which demands extra caution and proper footwear to navigate safely.

Another factor to consider is the shorter daylight hours. We'll need to start our daily treks early and be prepared to reach our destinations before darkness falls. This condensed trekking window means we must maintain a steady pace and manage our energy efficiently throughout the journey.

[Annapurna Base Camp 4130m](https://preview.redd.it/3yq29g7rljde1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4839aec3849c1729696d73132d0df5ce1e762c3b)

# Essential Gear for Annapurna Base Camp Trek in January

Packing the right gear is crucial for a successful and comfortable January trek to Annapurna Base Camp. Here's a comprehensive list of essentials:

1. Clothing:
   * Thermal base layers (top and bottom)
   * Fleece jacket or wool sweater
   * Down jacket
   * Waterproof and windproof outer shell
   * Insulated trekking pants
   * Warm hat and gloves
   * Thick, warm socks
2. Footwear:
   * Insulated, waterproof hiking boots
   * Gaiters to keep snow out of boots
   * Crampons or micro spikes for icy terrain
3. Sleeping gear:
   * Four-season sleeping bag (rated for at least -10°C)
   * Sleeping bag liner for extra warmth
4. Trekking equipment:
   * Trekking poles with snow baskets
   * Headlamp with extra batteries
   * Sunglasses with UV protection
   * Sunscreen and lip balm with high SPF
5. Miscellaneous:
   * Hand and foot warmers
   * Thermos for hot drinks
   * Water purification tablets or filter
   * First-aid kit with altitude sickness medication

Remember, layering is key in these conditions. We want to be able to adjust our clothing throughout the day as temperatures fluctuate and our activity levels change.

# Preparing for the Off-Season Adventure: Fitness and Acclimatization

Embarking on the [short Annapurna Base Camp Trek](https://www.nepalhightrek.com/activities/short-annapurna-base-camp-trek/) in January or February requires a higher level of physical preparation than during the peak seasons. The challenging weather conditions and potentially difficult terrain demand that we be in top form. I recommend starting a dedicated fitness regimen at least three months before the trek.

Focus on cardiovascular exercises that simulate the demands of trekking. Hill walking, stair climbing, and hiking with a loaded backpack are excellent ways to build endurance and strength. Incorporate strength training for your legs and core to improve stability on uneven and icy surfaces. Don't forget to include flexibility exercises to prevent injuries and aid in recovery after long days on the trail.

Acclimatization is another crucial aspect of our preparation. The risk of altitude sickness is present year-round but can be exacerbated by the cold temperatures in January. We'll need to ascend slowly, allowing our bodies time to adjust to the decreasing oxygen levels. A general rule of thumb is not to ascend more than 300-500 meters per day once we're above 3,000 meters.

To further aid acclimatization, consider taking diamox (acetazolamide) after consulting with a healthcare professional. Stay well-hydrated throughout the trek, even if you don't feel thirsty, as proper hydration is key to preventing altitude sickness.

# The Route: Detailed Itinerary for January Trek

Our journey to Annapurna Base Camp in January typically follows this itinerary:

1. Day 1: Arrive in Pokhara
2. Day 2: Drive to Nayapul and trek to Tikhedhunga (1,540m)
3. Day 3: Trek to Ghorepani (2,860m)
4. Day 4: Hike to Poon Hill (3,210m) for sunrise, then trek to Tadapani (2,630m)
5. Day 5: Trek to Chhomrong (2,170m)
6. Day 6: Trek to Dovan (2,600m)
7. Day 7: Trek to Machhapuchhre Base Camp (3,700m)
8. Day 8: Trek to Annapurna Base Camp (4,130m)
9. Day 9: Descend to Bamboo (2,310m)
10. Day 10: Trek to Jhinu Danda (1,780m)
11. Day 11: Trek to Nayapul and drive back to Pokhara

This itinerary allows for proper acclimatization and takes into account the shorter daylight hours in January. We'll start our days early, usually around sunrise, to make the most of the available light. The clear winter skies often provide stunning views throughout the trek, particularly at Poon Hill and, of course, at Annapurna Base Camp itself.

It's important to note that this schedule is flexible. We may need to adjust our plans based on weather conditions, trail conditions, or individual acclimatization needs. Always listen to your body and communicate any concerns with your trekking guide.

# Accommodation and Food Options in Winter

During our January [trek to Annapurna Base Camp](https://www.nepalhightrek.com/activities/annapurna-base-camp-trek-6-days/), we'll primarily stay in tea houses along the route. These simple lodges provide basic but comfortable accommodation, and in the off-season, we often have our pick of rooms. However, it's important to note that some tea houses in the higher regions may close during winter, so our options might be more limited as we ascend.

The rooms are typically twin-share with basic beds and blankets. Given the cold temperatures, I always recommend bringing our own sleeping bags for added warmth. Many tea houses have common areas with a stove or fireplace where trekkers gather in the evenings to socialize and stay warm.

As for food, tea houses offer a variety of simple but hearty meals. The staple dish is dal bhat, a traditional Nepali meal consisting of lentil soup, rice, and vegetables. It's an excellent choice for trekkers as it's nutritious, filling, and usually comes with free refills. Other common options include:

* Tibetan bread with jam or honey
* Porridge or muesli for breakfast
* Noodle soups
* Momos (dumplings)
* Pasta dishes
* Pancakes

In January, fresh vegetables and fruits may be limited at higher altitudes due to transportation difficulties. It's a good idea to carry some of your favorite snacks and energy bars for quick boosts during the day.

Staying hydrated is crucial, especially at high altitudes. Tea houses sell boiled water, which is safe to drink, or you can use water purification tablets or filters to treat water from local sources. Hot drinks like tea and coffee are readily available and are a great way to warm up.

# Safety Considerations for Annapurna Base Camp Trek in January

Trekking to Annapurna Base Camp in January requires extra attention to safety. The winter conditions present unique challenges that we must be prepared for. Here are some key safety considerations:

1. Weather monitoring: Keep a close eye on weather forecasts and be prepared to adjust your itinerary if severe weather is expected.
2. Avalanche awareness: The risk of avalanches increases in winter. Stick to established trails and heed any warnings from local authorities or your guide.
3. Frostbite and hypothermia prevention: Learn to recognize the signs of these cold-related conditions and take immediate action if symptoms appear.
4. Sun protection: Despite the cold, the sun's rays can be intense at high altitudes. Use high SPF sunscreen and wear sunglasses to protect against snow glare.
5. Trail conditions: Be prepared for icy or snow-covered trails, especially at higher elevations. Use trekking poles and consider carrying crampons or microspikes.
6. Communication: Ensure you have a reliable means of communication in case of emergencies. Satellite phones or personal locator beacons can be lifesavers in remote areas.
7. Travel insurance: Obtain comprehensive travel insurance that covers high-altitude trekking and helicopter evacuation.
8. Trekking with a guide: In winter conditions, the expertise of a local guide can be invaluable for navigation and safety.

Remember, there's no shame in turning back if conditions become too challenging or if you're not feeling well. The mountains will always be there for another attempt.

# Breathtaking Winter Scenery: What to Expect

One of the most rewarding aspects of trekking to Annapurna Base Camp in January is the stunning winter scenery. The landscape transforms into a winter wonderland, offering views that summer trekkers rarely experience. Here's what we can look forward to:

1. Snow-capped peaks: The entire Annapurna range, including Annapurna I, Annapurna South, and Machhapuchhre (Fishtail), is often blanketed in snow, creating a truly majestic panorama.
2. Pristine forests: The rhododendron and oak forests along the lower parts of the trail are dusted with snow, creating a serene and magical atmosphere.
3. Frozen waterfalls: As we ascend, we might encounter frozen waterfalls, their icy formations glistening in the sunlight.
4. Clear skies: January often brings clear, crisp skies, offering unobstructed views of the mountains and brilliant starry nights.
5. Sunrise at Poon Hill: The famous viewpoint of Poon Hill is even more spectacular in winter, with the first light of day painting the snow-covered peaks in hues of pink and gold.
6. Quiet villages: The villages along the route, with their traditional stone houses and terraced fields covered in a light blanket of snow, offer a picturesque glimpse into mountain life.
7. Wildlife sightings: While less common in winter, there's still a chance to spot native wildlife like the Himalayan tahr or colorful pheasants against the snowy backdrop.

These winter vistas provide unique photographic opportunities, so be sure to bring a good camera and extra batteries (cold temperatures can drain battery life quickly).

# Permits and Regulations for Off-Season Trekking

Even though we're trekking in the off-season, we still need to obtain the necessary permits for the Annapurna Base Camp trek. Here's what we need to know:

1. TIMS Card (Trekkers' Information Management System):
   * Cost: NPR 2000 (approximately USD 17) for individual trekkers
   * Can be obtained in Kathmandu or Pokhara
2. Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP):
   * Cost: NPR 3000 (approximately USD 25) for foreign nationals
   * Can be obtained in Kathmandu or Pokhara

These permits are required year-round, and the fees remain the same regardless of the season. It's important to note that while the trek might be less crowded in January, the permit checkpoints along the route will still be operational.

To obtain these permits, we'll need:

* Valid passport
* Passport-sized photographs
* Cash payment (in Nepali Rupees)

It's advisable to arrange these permits a day or two before starting the trek. Many trekking agencies can assist with the permit process as part of their services.

Additionally, it's crucial to respect local regulations and environmental guidelines throughout our trek:

* Stay on designated trails to prevent erosion and protect vegetation
* Properly dispose of waste and consider carrying out non-biodegradable trash
* Respect local customs and dress modestly, especially when visiting religious sites
* Ask permission before photographing local people
* Use biodegradable soaps and detergents

By adhering to these regulations and practicing responsible trekking, we help preserve the natural beauty and cultural integrity of the Annapurna region for future generations of trekkers.

# Tips from Experienced Trekkers: Conquering Annapurna in January

Having completed the Annapurna Base Camp trek in January myself and spoken with numerous other winter trekkers, I've compiled some valuable tips to help make your experience as smooth and enjoyable as possible:

1. Layer smartly: Start your day with multiple thin layers that you can easily add or remove as temperatures change.
2. Keep electronics warm: Store batteries and electronic devices close to your body to prevent rapid power drain in cold temperatures.
3. Start early: Take advantage of the clearer morning weather and longer sunlight hours by beginning your trek at first light.
4. Stay hydrated: Cold weather can mask thirst, so make a conscious effort to drink water regularly throughout the day.
5. Protect extremities: Use hand and toe warmers, and consider wearing liner gloves under your main gloves for added warmth.
6. Acclimatize properly: Don't rush the ascent. Take rest days and short acclimatization hikes to help your body adjust to the altitude.
7. Maintain a positive attitude: Winter trekking can be challenging, but a good mindset can make all the difference in your experience.
8. Bring entertainment: Pack a book, cards, or small games for the long evenings in tea houses.
9. Use trekking poles: They provide extra stability on icy or snow-covered trails and can help distribute your weight when carrying a heavy backpack.
10. Communicate with your guide: Keep an open dialogue about how you're feeling and any concerns you have throughout the trek.

Remember, every trekker's experience is unique. Be prepared to adapt your plans if necessary and always prioritize safety over reaching your destination.

Release date and supported platforms -

I aim to release Legacy Looper before summer on PC, Mac and Deck, in a completed, bug-free state (as much as is humanly possible!). No early-access builds that you have to wait ages to get the bugs fixed on. When you pay for the game, you get the whole game - no microtransactions either... ever!

How does the game work?

You start off as a simple adventurer (can you tell I'm a massive D&D fan?) who fights monsters and levels up their attributes to collect gold to be able to face bigger threats. You can leave a Legacy to future generations, which resets your progress but gives substantial gains to future combats and attributes. 
Gold can be used to unlock upgrades which boost various aspects of your gameplay.
Eventually you will unlock the ability to enter a new Era (previously named Eternities), leaving your legacy behind and starting your lineage completely anew, where you gain a permanent currency called Essence. 
Essence unlocks new content, powerful boosts and some quality of life upgrades. Through gaining achievements and accolades for your deeds, you will eventually gain the ability to enter Class Challenges, which change the base gameplay, giving boons and banes which you must use to your advantage to progress in a new way. Progression in Class Challenges lets you level up these Classes, unlocking combat abilities which you can use in difficult boss fights.

1i3ejdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i3ejdj/my_31m_girlfriend_31f_is_wearing_me_down_and_i/,My (31M) girlfriend (31F) is wearing me down and I don't know what to do?,"I've been with my girlfriend now for just over 4 years. It's been one of those relationships that has very much felt like an emotional rollercoaster and I'm not sure how much more I can take. We tend to bicker and argue quite often, sometimes about little things when then turn into big things. One minute we are great, very happy and loving, the next we are having an argument which may have started from something very small, a minor disagreement about a chore for example, which then gets turned into something way bigger, where she catastrophises our whole relationship, turns it into 'this relationship is so draining' and 'you don't love me' and 'why are we even doing this?'. We can't have one little disagreement about absolutely anything without her basically saying we should think about ending things.

  
I feel she is very guilty of being argumentative and passing blame on everything onto me, and takes no ownership or responsibility of anything she does or says wrong. Case in point, she had a clothes delivery this morning (these happen almost daily), I had just come back home from the gym and bought her a coffee, sat down at my desk to start work. I then start hearing her moaning and complaining loudly about how we have no space, this house is tiny, we need to build a new wardrobe and storage for her and the reason I don't is because I don't like DIY (which is true I don't but that's not stopped me from doing it), and our life is so boring. Now, I'm a bit more of a reserved and quiet person than she is, I'm a bit of an introvert and she is a big extrovert. My thing a lot of the time is to just not say anything or sit in silence, not say what's on my mind, basically because it avoids confrontation and any arguments and it's just easier. She has berated me in the past for doing that and told me to tell her to just be honest and say what I'm thinking at the time and not bring it up at a later point when we're already arguing about something (which is fair enough, I'm guilty of this). So this morning I asked her to stop as all I could hear was her complaining loudly about this, and also complaining about how boring her life is, shouting at the dogs too, and basically blaming me for having nowhere to put the excess clothes she has. I asked her not to do that, and asked her not to all of a sudden relate her lack of space for her shopping habits to a boring life.

Now, our life isn't boring, in my opinion. Less than a year ago we bought our first home together, which we've done so much to already (every single person who comes here can't believe how much work we've done already) We live in a nice area of the country with plenty around to do, she has her own business which involves lots of travel every year all round the world which she does do and loves, we take trips together all the time with our dogs throughout the year, we see friends and family a lot, have plenty of date nights where we can both in and out. I just feel like nothing is good enough for her, she's never satisfied. Something like building this big wardrobe and storage space costs money, I've told her multiple times I don't have it right now, I'm still paying back loans and debts from the purchase of this house and all the work we've already done. Conversations like this then spiral into how I need to get a pay rise again (I've had two pay rises in the past 2 years), how I'm stopping her from doing the things she wants to do, and I just feel like I'm not enough.

I mentioned catastrophisation as well - every now and then a few times a year, she will have a crisis (usually when she's away from me) about how our relationship is stagnant, she doesn't feel loved by me basically telling me ""you don't love me"" and that she ""knows what it feels like to be loved"", referring to past relationships (which were all toxic in their own way). These same conversations have happened numerous times in 4 years and I'm exhausted from them. We clearly have different love languages, and I really do feel like I show her love and affection on a regular basis and always have done. My love language is first and foremost Acts of Service - I do so incredibly much for her on a daily basis, anything I can do for her is at the forefront of my mind when I'm with her - and Quality Time, I love when we can spend time together outside of work, chores, etc, when it's either doing on dates or literally just chilling in the evening watching a show. We do show physical touch towards each other enough as well (I feel I initiate this way more than her, but of course, she would disagree), and the sex is always amazing. I also complement her often, tell her how great she looks whether it's in a new dress or how I like her hair today or randomly that I fancy her. I also feel like I do this way more than her, but in these crisis conversations that we then have, she says I never ever do it or say anything nice and that she doesn't feel attractive or that I care about her at all. 

We've both said to each other before that we feel like we're living on different planets, and as time goes on, as we get towards potential proposal/engagement/wedding/children times, I'm getting more and more worried. We're both 31, time is getting on, and with everyone around us getting engaged and married and having kids, it really feels like the pressure is on, especially with body clocks and all that. But, with the way we are and how often the argument and conflicts just randomly happen and exactly what gets said in them, I just cannot see us having a happy life like this, and getting married and bringing kids into the mix just feels like the wrong thing to do until something changes. She said to me before 'you know me, if I've done something wrong I'm the first person to say it', which to me, is an absolute joke. Nothing at all is her fault, and I feel like I can't win with her. I can either stay quiet and not say anything in certain situations to avoid conflict, or I do say something and we have the argument anyway and then nothing gets solved.

As a supporting point to all of that, she has very low self esteem, definite abandonment issues (her father left before she was born and she's never met him), was brought up by different family members throughout her life, has had bad past relationships, and (I don't want to ever say this to her), feel like there might be a touch of BPD. Her moods go from 0 to 100 to 0 to 100, there is so much insecurity there as well (which she of course denies), and has issues with anger and anxiety. We have been close to breaking up multiple times but have always brought it back, and are so quick at being normal and loving with each other. But it's this that's exhausting me. 

I'm very scared at my own thoughts on this and what would happen if we did break up. I would lose her, I would lose all my friends, I would lose this house that I love, I would need to move back in with my mum temporarily which would do an absolute number on my mental health, and I would have a very uncertain future ahead. It's just very hard at the moment, I feel like I'm in a relationship that's not bad enough to leave but not good enough to stay. Our lives are very much tied together and intertwined already, and it would only get more so if we got married and had kids. If we're bickering and arguing and having all these conversations now, wouldn't it just be much worse with kids in the mix? Truthfully, (even though we're both not ready for kids yet) I can't yet see her as someone I want to have kids with ever unless something changes. She has often said as well that she thinks the man should do way more and have way more responsibility because the woman is the one who carries the baby, and that I should prepare for the likelihood of her getting PND (which to be honest? This would feel like hell for me based on the way she is).

I know most people are going to just say I need to let her go. But, it's so hard to just do that. I love this woman, she's strong, kind (most of the time), good-natured, independent, caring, loyal and trustworthy. It's just I feel like I'm in a relationship with multiple different people at times, our relationship often goes from amazing to close-to-breaking-up within 1 day so feels like thin ice, I feel like I'm on egg shells often, and the main problem is that we are both 31 and everyone is expecting me to propose, and I just can't think about that yet. Which makes me scared because from what I've heard, when deciding your future with someone, it should either be a 'fuck yeah' or a 'no', and it's not a 'fuck yeah'

Appreciate advice on this. I am in the process of trying to get therapy so I can talk out properly about my feelings, both on this relationship as well as other things like my internal crises and how to manage life. If anyone suggests couples therapy though - I've suggested this multiple times to improve our understanding and communication with each other, and she has basically said, due to her past experiences with therapy and how it hasn't helped and how she thinks therapists just wanted to hear gossip, she has said she wouldn't do it with me, that she thinks I would 'throw her under the bus' in there, and there's no way whatever was discussed wouldn't come home with us and have a bad result. You also might say we're simply incompatible. We are not the most compatible of couples that's for sure but we very much want to be in this together and not throw away everything, but I'm just worried for my own future.

  
Sorry it's long.

  
TL;DR my relationship is an emotional rollercoaster and I don't have a clue what I should do, we're very different people and I can't see ourselves having a future together unless something changes.",3,1737114235.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I’m living in a small town in Hessen, and I have 2 kids. The oldest is about to turn 3 and we are throwing her her first party. She’s wildly excited. Now, as the date is starting to get near, I’m second guessing everything because I’ve never been to a little kids party before. Honestly not sure I’ve been to one at home in Ireland either. 

So what do kids parties generally look like? I’m planning to have some birthday cake, some other baked goods and loads of fruit. Apfelschorle and water. Coffee/tea and maybe beer for the parents. I wrote 2-5pm on the invites and husband is already unsure if it was “correct” to put an end time. Do I need to have games prepared? More substantial food? Goodie bags?

At first, it felt a bit daunting. The idea of sitting there, surrounded by people chatting and laughing in groups, made me feel like I might stick out. But I wanted to try something new (my friends ditched me) , so I went for it.

I walked in, ordered my coffee, and found a cozy corner . At first, I kept fidgeting with my phone, pretending to look busy. But then, I put it away and just... sat there. I watched the world go by—the barista chatting with customers, the soft clinking of cups, the hum of life happening around me.

And then it hit me. As I sipped my coffee, I started to feel at ease. I wasn’t waiting for someone to join me or filling the silence with distractions. I was just there with myself.

In that moment, I realized something profound: when you truly start to enjoy your own company, you become inevitable. You stop relying on external validation to feel whole. You learn to appreciate the little things—a warm drink, a good view, and the quiet joy of simply being.

This solo café visit turned out to be so much more than I expected. It wasn’t just about coffee; it was about discovering a sense of contentment within myself.

If you’ve ever hesitated to go somewhere alone, let this be your sign to try it. You might just learn something beautiful about yourself.",10,1737114008.0,nagpur,4,1.0,False

“Honey Singh was right: ‘Chakko chakko, kuch bhi fresh nahi milega.’
Man really predicted the dating scene like a prophet. Let me explain:

So, one day I installed a dating app. Full disclosure—I was looking for a long-term, wholesome relationship. None of that hookup stuff. I matched with a thick, pretty girl, and things started off great. We exchanged witty jokes, texted all the time, and one night, we ended up talking till late. The next day, she was a bit tipsy and told me I could ask her anything about her life. Of course, I went for the classic “Tell me about your first time.”

Turns out, she wasn’t a virgin. No biggie. But then she casually mentioned she’d hooked up with two guys before—and oh, also had an ex she was really into. And let me tell you, it wasn’t the ex part that stung. It was the hookup thing. Like, why, Miss ? Anyway, we eventually called it off, because things just weren’t working out (and no, we never even met).

Fast forward, I meet this other girl. Works at an NGO, super smart, beautiful, and hilarious. Our vibe was basically Tom and Jerry—constant banter. One day, she asks if I’ve ever kissed someone. Me? Old-school gentleman here, so nope. Then it’s her turn to share. She starts talking about her recent Goa trip (red flag alert). She installed Bumble while there and matched with a guy. They stayed out late and… yep, they made out. I mean,you just met him! I tried to act unbothered, but it stung, and then she hits me with the cherry on top: “Yeah, the thought of going further did cross my mind.” Ma’am, I didn’t need to know that, this made me feel very crappy, and my heart ached like for a week 💀😂

Anyway, moving on, I started talking to this girl I met through mutual friends in an online game. Things heated up recently, and she asked me to install Snapchat (which I never used, but hey, for her, why not?). We started sharing pictures, had to see how we looked and rated each other so, she sent her picture, turns out she’s a pretty girl with green eyes(Wamiqa Gabbi look alike )I sent her a shirtless pic, as it was night(I sleep shirtless )and had to sent one then and (don’t judge—it was accidental. Okay, maybe not) and man I’m a bit ripped 🤏 or maybe bit more’, and her reaction? “Are you a virgin?” Bruh. I said yes, and she hits me with, “I don’t believe you—with that face and eyes?”(I have hazel eyes)

Now here’s where it gets wild: I ask her if she’s a virgin, and she casually drops this bomb—she hooked up with some guy she barely knew after meeting him once. Not only that, she proudly says she made the first move because, “Guys never say no.” Excuse me, ma’am, what? At this point, I was just sitting there questioning my life decisions.(next day when i had to listen to isq-risk and ishq bulaava, to channel all my emotions -energy and range in gym while exercising🫡😂)

Finally, let’s talk about my best friend—a woman I consider like a sister. She tells me over coffee one day, “Yeah, casual stuff is pretty common for girls.” And then she drops her life story: After her breakup, she had two “situationships”—one was a hookup, and the other was a trial run for something serious (spoiler: it didn’t work out). She even said she hoped the casual thing would turn into a long-term relationship. Sis, this isn’t Netflix—there’s no “continue watching” button for hookups.

So yeah, moral of the story? It sucks when the girls you’re into don’t value themselves and decide to hook up with strangers. I mean, I get it when it’s an ex—it’s emotional. But a stranger? Feels bad, man.

Also, shoutout to Honey Singh for seeing the future of dating before anyone else did. “Kuch bhi fresh nahi milega.” Truer words have never been spoken.”

My question is should i give up on my principles of values ,ethics and morality and walk the path of lust as everyone in this generation, Or should I give dating an another shot in this fdup💀 generation?",1,1737113423.0,TeenIndia,2,1.0,False

I moved in with my roommate about a year ago 'cause the rent in this city is ridiculous, and finding a decent roommate was like winning the Hunger Games. We clicked super fast, same sense of humor, same obsession with Thai takeout, and somehow, we never fight about cleaning. A miracle, honestly.

Last night, we were chillin’ on the couch, watching this cringe rom-com. One of those friends to lovers plots where everyone knows they’re gonna end up together except them. I was feeling extra goofy and blurted out, “Yo, we should just get married. Like, why are we wasting time?”

He laughed, so I thought it was just a vibe. Like, platonic banter, ya know? Fast forward to this morning, I’m half-asleep in my hoodie, face-deep in coffee, and he walks in with the most serious expression holding... a bread twist tie. MY GUY HAD TURNED IT INTO A RING.

He goes, “So… were you serious last night?” I nearly choked on my coffee. Like, sir, WHAT? I thought we were joking! My brain just blue-screened while he stood there all hopeful. I panicked, laughed it off, and mumbled something about needing a real diamond if we were gonna do this right.

Now I’m low-key avoiding him ‘cause IDK if he’s embarrassed, mad, or planning our wedding. It’s awkward af.

I finally got my first ritalin dosis 1 month ago, and - as expected, the initial high or difference was very noticeable. 

Obviously this massive effect has worn down after taking it a while and i recently increased my dosis to 2x10mg after only 1x10mg per day.

However it now feels that the effects have mostly completely gone away. I do feel a little bit more calm but that's it. The next step would be to increase dosis, but I am unsure if a higher dosis will also eventually end the same way.

Is this how the cycle is going to be until i eventually hit the daily dose cap, which is also going to have no effect at some point. 

Or will there be a dosis that works, and the effects will continue?

To me : I am 33, and I am taking a small coffee to fight my caffeine addiction in the morning at 7, and then take me first pill at around 9:30. Second is at around 15.

Any advice / experience / help is greatly appreciated.

I just know that most songs out there are about romantic relationships and it's because it sells. So we can agree at least that love songs are very popular.
I'm aware there are many songs about other topics, but you really have to look for it to find them. If you just have a look on the top 40 songs on any platform, you can be assured that most or even all of them are just about one theme: love. 
Now they're sad because they broke up, than they're happy 'cause they found the right one, than they are angry because they had a fight, this just sums up pretty much all the mainstream songs of today. It feels boring and uninspiring to me at this point.
I'd rather hear songs about personal failures, ambitions, travel, nature even food. There was this song Espresso, but unfortunately it was just another song about relationships. I would have been more intrigued if it actually talked about coffee.
 Maybe the issue lies on the fact that these singers live a very privileged life where their only concern is to find a good boyfriend/girlfriend. Idk, i just want it to stop.",5,1737113305.0,unpopularopinion,10,0.86,False
1i3eay9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/1i3eay9/i_wish_it_were_easier_to_know_which_products_were/,I wish it were easier to know which products were made with slave labor. ,"

When buying chocolate and coffee, it’s easy enough to look for a fair trade certification label. I don’t know how rigorous their standards are, but it’s a lot better than most products. I’m willing to trust that Tony’s Chocolonely and Death Wish coffee were made by workers who were paid for their time and were free to quit. 

Electronics are nearly guaranteed to contain conflict minerals that were mined with slave labor. There is something called the Fair Phone, but I have no idea how to buy that in the US. 

The Fair Trade website has a page about seafood, but I can’t figure out which (if any) seafood brands are certified. I trust that fresh seafood in the US is probably caught by people who chose to work on a fishing boat. I have no idea where canned seafood comes from. 

If you expand your search beyond literal slave labor to include other unethical labor practices, then it becomes completely impossible to avoid. I know about individual problem companies like Amazon, whose workers have to pee in bottles to meet productivity quotas, and Tyson, who is employing children in dangerous poultry factories, but I’m sure there are plenty of other terrible labor practices that don’t make the news. 

I just wish that every type of product came with an ethical certification label, so I could choose to support companies that don’t harm humans. Ideally, I would love it if all of these products were required to be made without harming humans, but I realize that that’s too much to ask.

1i3e9nw,https://www.reddit.com/r/GRE/comments/1i3e9nw/169_quant_161_verbal_5_analytical_writing_15/,"169 Quant, 161 Verbal, 5 Analytical Writing: 1.5 months of Studying with Gregmat","Hey all,

Took the GRE last week and just received my official score. 169 quant, 161 verbal, 5 analytical writing, overall Im really happy with the way things turned out and I wanted to share how I studied, the resources I used, and a thing or two I could have done better. I hope this can help someone either get started or provide some insight on a studying framework, especially for quant.

My goal was ultimately a 320 split 160, 160, so I hit my goal on the writing and very much surpassed it on the quant. As far as the analytical writing, I just wanted to get something decent enough that I felt I didn't have to retake the test again.

Ill ultimately be applying to more math based programs so for the me the quant score is really what's important

Apologies for the essay, I know its long but its been cathartic to write this out after a pretty intense month and a half.

**First a few numbers from practices tests for comparison.**

I started studying mid-late November by taking the free test that Princeton review has. I don't have access to the scores any more but it was something like a 150 verbal, 146ish quant.

The night before the actual GRE, I took two of the GregMat GRE practice tests, the first one I got 158 Quant, 161 Verbal, the second one I got a 168 quant, 163 Verbal.

The second test was extremely close to my actual score. After the GRE I was really surprised by how close the GregMat tests are to the actual GRE despite being non-ETS material. They were super valuable for me to get a sense of the pacing of the test, and how I should use time to answer questions.

**Study Strategy and Timeline**

First a few caveats on things that set me up to do well. 

First and foremost, I am a data analyst/data scientist in my professional career. I do not consider my self as someone who likes or is good at math in general, but there was a large part of the data analysis section of the quant stuff that I already knew and was familiar with. And while I hadn't done any algebra or geometry in years prior to studying for this, I code all day and writing functions and scripts I think does help.

Secondly, I read a lot. I didn't spend so much time studying for the verbal section. I didn't do a ton of practice or studying other than watching the PrepSwift videos on strategy, and the reason I think I did reasonable well is just that I read a lot and my reading comprehension is already pretty high. 

As far as the timeline, I had about a month and a half to study in total. I started around thanksgiving and took the test last week. I also work full time, so this was a pretty compressed timeline with a lot of restrictions around when I could study and how much time I had to study. **Generally speaking, I was studying about 3-4 hours a day, Monday through Saturday.** For the first two weeks I was studying on Sunday, but discovered I was burning out very quickly and needed a day off.

**Studying for Quantitative**

When I was first deciding how to study, I took a look at the two month or one month study plans on gregmat, but I just didn't have the 6 hours a day that looked roughly necessary to do it. Maybe Im wrong, I didn't try watching the videos one double speed, but it didn't seem feasible with my schedule. So I used exclusively PrepSwift to review material. 

Watch all the videos, do all the practice problems with the videos, do the tick box quizzes, and when you're watching the videos pause the video and try and solve the questions on screen on your own before Greg does. For the first few weeks this is exclusively what I was doing to study and it was a real slog. But it really helped me review and re-master a lot of concepts I hadn't seen since high school, and while painful after a few hours it was entirely necessary for me to do.

The strategy videos were also super helpful. Especially the Simplify and Manipulate (really helpful for the quantity A quantity B questions), Choosing Numbers, and Pattern Recognition. But I only watched these after doing material.

After this, I just did a lot of practice problems. From gregmat I did something close to about 500 practice problems for math. When I first starting doing practice problems, I was getting a lot wrong or I would get stuck, or I would know what concept to apply. Towards the end of studying, I was getting more questions right than wrong and I could recognize the concept to apply much, much faster. 

If you're feeling discouraged with the quant, try and be patient with yourself and give yourself some grace. Its hard but it does get better over time with practice.

Additionally, there were a few concepts I found to be the most useful: Prime Factorization, Exponent Rules were really really important, percent change, interior angles, similar triangles, all things circles, mean, median, and standard deviation.

**Studying for Qualitative**

The majority of studying I did for this was the PrepSwift strategy videos. These were the absolute best. I had tried to study at first by just doing GRE power pack reading problems and I was really frustrated by how hard I found a lot of the questions. But the prep swift videos taught me how to think about and approach these questions, and that's when things started to click. The word of Zeus was the most important for me. I didn't realize how literal you need to be when reading the questions and the text. It's borderline legalistic in the approach to reading that doesn't feel very natural, but once he explained how the test works things started getting easier.

For word matching and text completion, I did not do much in terms of vocab memorization. I think I did like 8 of the 33 groups, and not a single word of the ones I memorized showed up on my test. I did a few of the gregmat text completion or word matching problems, and of like the 50-60 I did I got ht majority right. I was feeling pretty cavalier about it after a while, and motivation was starting to a be problem so I didn't do too much of the vocab.

**Analytical Writing**

This is one I did the least preparation for. The night before I googled what ETS is looking for, and found an article from Kaplan. The key take aways were 1. 5 paragraph essay with an intro three body paragraphs and a conclusion, just like high school, 2. write in short declarative sentences, 3. Introduce something in your conclusion that could be used to argue against you, and refute it.

I kept those three points in mind and I wrote about ancient rome using podcast knowledge and Im alright with a 5/6.

**Test Taking Strategies That Helped Me**

I used the mark a question and review function a lot for both quant and verbal sections. If I couldn't immediately figure out a question, I would mark it and come back to it later. This helped me stay in a bit of a flow state and not be interrupted by a question that was a bit of a stumper. And often times I found I would come back to a question and find that just by giving it a little time and space, I would have a new approach or some revelation which helped me.

USE EVERY GODDAMN SECOND THEY GIVE YOU. If you have extra time after answering everything, go back and review, give hard questions another pass, see if your logic for how you answered question still makes sense a second time. I definitely caught a few mistakes using this.

**What I Would Have Done Differently**

First, I would have scheduled my test two weeks ahead of time. I scheduled my test two days before I took it, and it lit a fire under my ass to study. I was really struggling with motivation to study by the end, and if I had scheduled it two weeks out I think it would have given me a motivation boost to study a bit more.

Second, probably I would have done a bit more vocab. While Im content with my verbal score, I could have likely picked up a few points just by doing the vocab mountain. 

**Final Thoughts, a TLDR, and a Big Thank You to Greg**

This test really sucks. I didn't like studying for it, but I want to go to grad school and this really helps with admissions. All your negative thoughts and feelings about this test are totally valid, but think about it as the price you have to pay to do what you want in life. 

And you absolutely can do it, persistence and patience is really the key. Keep watching the videos, keep doing practice problems, and take notes while you're at it. You'll see improvement.

GregMat is the absolute best thing ever. Aside from the affordability, the material is chunked out in a super digestible manner, his videos and explanations are very clear, his sense of humor is really a bit of sugar in the medicine, and he really understands the mechanics and underpinnings of the test. I couldn't recommend it enough, a big thank you to Greg. You're awesome dude.

TLDR: Persistent studying will get you to the score you want. GregMat is a really great resource to the point where I didn't really use anything else. You can do it! Its just a matter of time, patience, and if you're like me a disturbing amount of coffee.

And unit digits can go straight to hell.

Chapter I



Oliver groaned as the morning sunlight shone through his curtains and landed across his face, pulling his sage comforter up over his head. Despite having turned in an hour earlier last night than he usually would, he felt as if he’d barely slept. This feeling had been becoming more and more familiar to Oliver over the past few weeks, profuse and unrelenting. 



His doctor was quick to assign his poor sleep quality to stress from work, not finding anything of note wrong with him physically. Armed with the melatonin gummies he’d been prescribed, and instructions to cut down on his caffeine intake, Oliver set out to minimize as much work-related stress as he reasonably could.



Regardless of the barrier between Oliver and the sunlight seeping into his room, he found that no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t fall back asleep. Sitting up, he pushed the comforter down off of his head, leaving his brown curls in disarray. He took a moment, acclimating to being awake again, before he tossed his legs off over the side of the bed, sliding on his slippers and feeling for his glasses on the bedside table.



Ignoring his desire to crawl back into his bed, he made his way over to the window, pulling open the green curtains and flooding the room with light, hoping to jump-start his circadian rhythm. Oliver blinked a few times as his eyes adjusted to the increased brightness before they refocused, and he used his shirt sleeve to wipe the fog from the window.



It was early- too early, Oliver would argue- but the street beneath his window was already bustling, filled with people beginning their day- and some ending it, by the tired, sluggish look of the blue-clad workers making their way home from the gas station up the road. He groggily rubbed his eyes, smudging his glasses in the process. For a few moments, he stood in the window watching on, trying to soak up as much sunlight as he could, glad that he didn’t work Wednesdays.



When he had awoken enough for the sound of the traffic on the street below him to become grating, he made his way to the bathroom, rubbing at his eyes again in the mirror before splashing cold water on his face. Generally, his morning routine would start with a shower, but for a week now, his apartment had been without warm water. Shooting his landlord yet another annoyed text, he dried his face on a plush towel, and made his way to the kitchen, grabbing an apple and a granola bar before settling at the small table.



Despite his best efforts, his mind kept drifting to work, and the rapidly approaching deadline for his article. Sure, he had a few days left, and he could undoubtedly get it done, but every moment he spent not working on it felt like wasted time, even if it was his day off. 



Done with his small breakfast, he crouched in front of the kitchen sink, opening the cupboard and retrieving a small watering can and a small bag of worm castings. Going through the small studio, he scattered the fertiliser into each of his houseplants, and watered those of them that were due for it, moving a few of them into the windowsill for the day. With a notepad, he marked down the date and which plants were watered, along with any new growth or concerning spots.



All of his plants were doing well- they generally did- with the exception of his spiderwort, which looked a little underwatered. Oliver gave it a little extra water, careful not to overwhelm it, and made a note to himself to check on it these next few days. He double-checked his notepad, ensuring he’d addressed any concerns he’d noted previously, before returning his watering can back to its place under the sink.



Walking back to his desk and picking up another log, a journal this time, he began to read over his next task- feeding his insects. Most of his pets were fine for the moment, needing to be fed in a few days. Recently though, he had taken on two new young tarantulas that needed to be fed more frequently than the rest of his pets.



Moving to crouch in front of the shelf that held their enclosures, Oliver pulled out a small, shallow tub. He unclamped the lid, flipping it over to check for any unlikely passengers before he sat it onto the floor beside him. Carefully, he gathered two small mealworms, setting them into a designated dish before reclosing the tote and sliding it back into storage.



Oliver set the dish down onto the shelf as he stood, retrieving a pair of metal tongs, and he opened the first enclosure. This sling was a female rose hair, and relatively gentle. With a practised confidence, Oliver picked up one of the mealworms, and held it out to the spider. Tentatively, she took it from him, and slowly backed away from the tongs.



Closing the first enclosure, he stepped towards the second, taking a breath. This sling was a female striped-knee, and considerably more flighty. Cautiously, he grabbed the mealworm with the tongs, and cracked the enclosure open just enough to reach the tongs in. He set down the mealworm in front of the tarantula as opposed to handing it to her, and then prodded the substrate a few inches back, trying to get her to take it. 



Oliver let out a sigh of relief as she struck, taking the mealworm and scurrying away, glad she hadn’t tried to bolt from the enclosure again. He set his tongs down and watched her for a moment. This was far from the first difficult spider he had kept, but they always had a knack for catching him off guard, and he was just happy that she hadn’t been too stressed to eat in her new home.



With all of his responsibilities taken care of for the day, Oliver made his way back to the bedroom, setting his task journal down onto the side table before shucking off his slippers and sitting in his bed. While he was thankful for the free time, he couldn’t truly enjoy it- not with the feeling that he was wasting time still droning on in the back of his mind. 



After a while spent mindlessly scrolling through his phone, he decided to fight the feeling by getting out of the house. He stood, and made his way to his closet, rummaging around for clothes. In the end, he’d decided on a pair of black trousers, and a white dress shirt, pulling a grey sweater vest on over it. He fussed with his hair for a moment, trying to wrangle it into something somewhat presentable, then he shuffled into his shoes, grabbed a book, and left his apartment. 



Oliver was halfway down the stairs when he heard a familiar creaking rasp a few feet behind him, and he turned around to investigate. Trailing after him, jumping down the steps to catch up, was his neighbour's senior tabby. Without much elegance, as the cat caught up to him, it slabbed its head into Oliver’s leg in an affectionate gesture.



“Good morning to you too Winston.” Oliver greeted, bending to run his fingers through his scraggly orange fur. Winston croaked out a meow in response, purring. Oliver smiled, picking up the cat and continuing his way down the stairs. Winston rubbed his face against Oliver’s cheek, claws kneading into his sweater vest. Reaching the bottom of the stairs, Oliver gave the tabby a kiss on the head, before placing him down in front of his owner’s cracked door.



“Be good, yeah?” Oliver said to him, watching the old cat brush against the doorframe. He chuckled, and unlocked the front door, stepping through it out of the apartment complex. Pulling his keys from his pocket, he relocked the door, turning to walk down the street.



The street had quieted somewhat by this point, though there was the occasional voice or horn to cut through the usual droning sound of city life. He kept his gaze low, watching the sidewalk as he walked, careful not to trip over any of the cracks in the concrete. The sidewalk was in bad shape, and Oliver couldn’t imagine the city would ever repair it.



It was a shame though, he thought. The area had the potential to be really beautiful if it were taken care of properly. The houses around were pretty, with red brick and white painted wood, even if the apartment complex he lived in looked industrial in comparison. Most of the houses were in varying states of disrepair though, and their owners didn’t have the funds to keep up- especially not with the rising cost of rent in the neighbourhood.



Oliver had originally moved into his apartment because it was the cheapest housing he could find that was in a decent area, somewhere he could get around without a car. These past few years though, the cost of rent and utilities had been steadily rising, and if he hadn’t signed a lease, Oliver would surely be looking for new housing. 



Several minutes passed, and Oliver watched the sidewalk’s state slowly become less neglected as he went further into the city. Bending, he plucked a plastic bottle from the grass beside the sidewalk, frowning to himself and stuffing it into his pocket. 



Coming up on the crosswalk that stood between him and his destination- the one that had been broken since he’d moved here- he looked both ways before quickly sprinting across the street. Stepping onto the sidewalk on the opposite side, he pulled the bottle from his pocket and deposited it into the recycling bin. 



Oliver walked for a few more minutes, weaving through the narrow alleyways in between the shops downtown, before finding himself in front of the café that he spent his days off in. Smiling and waving to the man who usually practised his guitar in the mornings outside of the shop, Oliver pulled the glass door open and stepped in. 



His senses were met with the smell of fresh coffee and the low sound of the café’s patrons chatting amongst themselves. There was a small blonde woman behind the counter taking orders, and she smiled in Oliver’s direction as he entered. His eyes drifted to the large fridge behind her as he waited his turn, looking over the hundreds of stickers plastered onto it.



The man in front of Oliver moved to take a seat as he waited for his order, and as Oliver stepped up, the peppy woman turned, grabbing an already prepared cup of tea and sliding it towards him across the counter. 



“You’re a few minutes late, we were worried your tea was going to go cold!” The woman remarked lightheartedly as Oliver swiped his card. He smiled warmly in response as he put his card back into his wallet.



“I was detained.” He joked, picking up the hot paper cup.



“Winston’s in one of his moods I take it?” She chuckled, eying the scraggly orange fur still clinging to Oliver’s sweater vest from his earlier altercation. 



“Oh, always.” He chuckled, nodding and trying futilely to brush the remaining fur from his vest. “Fiona’s been leaving her door cracked so he can roam, he likes to nap on the rug in the stairwell.” 



The doorbell chimed, announcing the arrival of another customer, and the blonde-haired woman gave Oliver a playful salute, moving to take their order. Oliver returned the gesture, making his way further into the coffee shop and sitting on an old repurposed crate. Setting his book down on the small table, Oliver took the lid from his cup and took a drink of the tea. Luckily, the tea was still hot, soothing the chill he’d endured outside.



The café was slower than usual today, with fewer people scattered around the dining area. Oliver recognised a few of the faces, regulars who tended to visit the shop on the same days he did. Like him, they all tended to keep to themselves, engrossed in their own activities. 



Some brought laptops, the gentle sound of typing mingling with the muffled sound of the guitar strumming outside. Others brought books like he did, and some brought art supplies. Today, the person who caught his attention was a young woman with short brown hair and large circular glasses, who was slouched over a pad of paper, fussing over a watercolour painting. 



She was one of the regulars, and Oliver had heard the baristas call her name a few times over his visits to the café- Kaiya. The piece she was fussing over was the same piece she’d been working on last Sunday when he’d seen her in the shop, a portrait of a woman in lavender tones in the reflection of a cracked mirror. Oliver always enjoyed seeing her here, looking up over his book periodically to see the progress she’d made on her works. A few times, he’d considered talking to her and asking her about her work, but could never bring himself to break her focus.



Setting his cup down onto the table, Oliver picked up his novel, navigating to the place he left off and tucking the ribbon beneath the book as he began to read. He let the sounds of the guitar and gentle typing fade into the background, his attention fully preoccupied with his reading. Occasionally, the sound of the doorbell or a car horn outside broke his focus, and he took these moments to peek at the progress of the woman’s painting. 



His time spent at the café was the highlight of Oliver’s week. He’d come on his days off of work, and infrequently, after work when he finished his work early. On these days, he could allow himself to find himself immersed completely in his novels, forgetting about the feeling of time wasted, even if only for a few hours. He could spend a lifetime like this, he thought to himself.



Several hours passed, and he’d made a sizable dent in his novel. Customers came and went, going nearly unnoticed by Oliver. Looking up over his book, Kaiya had made a good deal of progress herself. The piece had a considerable amount more contrast, and she’d added a metallic silver pigment around the border of the page and on the shards of mirror. Oliver brought his cup to his lips, finishing the last of his tea, which had long since gone cold. Closing the ribbon into the page he’d left off on, he stood and made his way to the front of the café.



Oliver dropped his now-empty cup into the recycling bin, giving the blonde barista a friendly wave before exiting the shop. The air had grown slightly cooler, and the sky had become overcast. Oliver hoped to himself that he wouldn’t be caught in the rain on his way back home. He quickly wove through the alleyways, looking both ways as he reached the sidewalk, before dashing across the street once more, slowing when his feet met the sidewalk. 



Generally, Oliver would have stopped by the shops on his way back home, but today it had slipped his mind before he left his apartment, and he had forgotten to grab his canvas bags. He couldn’t be too annoyed by this though, figuring that even if he had remembered, that the weather would have effectively thwarted his plans anyways. He picked up his pace as he felt a cold gust, mussing his hair.



As he reached his apartment, he rummaged through his pocket for his keys, pulling them out and unlocking the door. He stepped inside, latching it behind him, and rubbing the dirt from his shoes onto the mat beside the door. Beginning to ascend the stairs, he heard the same raspy squeak from earlier on the second set of stairs. Looking up, he saw Winston peeking down at him from between the bars of the railing.



“Been waiting for me, have you?” Oliver called to him. As he passed the cat, Winston was quick to walk in step with him, following him to his apartment. Oliver pulled open his apartment door, and Winston bolted past him and into the room, hastily jumping up onto the bed. 



“You do have a home of your own, you know.” Oliver gently chided, rolling his eyes. Leaving the door cracked, he made his way into the small apartment, placing his novel down onto the desk. He lit a spice scented candle, placing it high on a shelf where Winston couldn’t get to it. As he passed the bed, Oliver shuffled the comforter around, tucking the cat in. 



After Oliver had gotten settled in once more, making a hearty lunch to make up for his meager breakfast, he settled at his desk. Flipping open his laptop, he checked his email. His inbox was what he’d expected, a message from Meghan- his supervisor- reminding everyone of their deadlines. He shot a message back, letting her know the progress he’d made, and his expected finish date before he closed the laptop. 



Standing, he pulled a record from his shelf and sat it atop the player, filling the room with the quiet sound of piano. Trying to push the thought of work from his mind, he moved around the room, tidying as he went. He enjoyed writing, and had a particular affinity for non-fiction, but he hated the way his job made him do it.



He’d originally taken on the job with the hopes that he’d get to do what he enjoyed for work, but his hopes had been tarnished within days of writing for his company. For the most part, he wrote about recent news and events, as well as the occasional piece about new scientific endeavours that had been happening. The problem he had lay with the way his higher-ups seemed more focused on meeting a deadline and crafting an article that caught people’s attention than they were with making sure the article was well-researched and factual.



Scooping up his laptop again, Oliver shuffled into bed beside the napping cat and began to work at his most recent passion project- a blog about plant care. Here, he could do as he pleased without the fear of being reprimanded for not outputting something ‘clickable’ enough. His following was small, with few enough people that he could remember them all by name, but it was his, and his alone.



Oliver knew a lot about various plants, having picked up quite a few things over the years he’d been keeping them. He enjoyed the tranquil simplicity they represented, and liked to watch how they behaved. If you kept close enough of an eye on them, the way they communicated was unambiguous, they’d tell you overtly what they needed. He liked the way they flourished when they were well taken care of, the way they’d move and perk up after being watered or placed nearer to the sunlight.



He continued his meticulous work as the sunlight faded, occasionally taking a break to pet the purring mass of orange that had nuzzled deeper under the covers. He found an odd sort of peace in compiling his knowledge in one place, both for himself to reference in the future, and for others to use as a guide to care for their own plants. Soon enough, Fiona’s voice quietly rang out from the floor beneath them, and Winston lazily worked his way out from beneath the covers, stretching languidly before hopping down from the bed and leaving through the door Oliver had left cracked for him.



Following Winston’s movements, Oliver stretched as well, rubbing his eyes under his glasses. Citing a few final sources at the bottom of his article, he pressed the post button, watching the page reload as his work was put up. With a sense of fulfilment, he closed his laptop, moving from his bed to place it back on the desk and shut the door. He blew out his candle, and upon seeing it, made a mental note to order another soon. 



Oliver went through the motions of his nightly routine, drinking tea by the window before brushing his teeth and slipping into his sleep clothes. Flicking the overhead lights off, and turning on the soft glow of his bedside night light, Oliver shuffled beneath the covers. With his curls flattened against the pillow, he looked up to the ceiling. Faintly, he could make out the shape of swirling stars, though they were hard to see without his glasses. The faint smell of the spiced candle and his tea still lingered in the air, and he closed his eyes, trying to allow them to lull him to sleep.",2,1737112626.0,BetaReaders,2,1.0,False

On January 18th, Alex de Minaur takes on Francisco Cerundolo in a matchup that's about as lopsided as a kangaroo versus a koala in a boxing match.

De Minaur, the Aussie favorite, is a whopping 1.08 to 8.2 favorite according to FanDuel, which is like saying the chances of me writing a funny joke are 1.08 to 8.2 (spoiler alert: it's not going to happen). The rest of the bookies are singing the same tune, with BetMGM offering 1.11 for de Minaur and 6.25 for Cerundolo.

Now, I know what you're thinking: ""Is Cerundolo a lost cause?"" Well, not quite. The underdog wins about 25% of the time in tennis, which is like finding a decent coffee shop in Melbourne – it's not impossible, but it's not exactly common either.

My best bet? Take Cerundolo with a +7.5 spread at 2.02 on BetRivers. It's a long shot, but hey, at least you'll get a good story out of it. And who knows, maybe Cerundolo will pull off the upset of the century, and you'll be the one laughing all the way to the bank.

Just don't say I didn't warn you. De Minaur is the clear favorite for a reason, and it's not just because he's got the home-court advantage. He's got the skills, the talent, and the momentum to take down Cerundolo in straight sets.

So, there you have it. A prediction that's about as safe as a platypus in a crocodile-infested billabong. Take it for what it's worth, and may the odds be ever in your favor.",1,1737112550.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

Backstory:y brother was found passed away in his bed back in May 2024 with no cause of death found. This triggered my doctor to start running cans on me (heart, liver, brain, lungs etc) to see I maybe we can find what the cause was and if it would somehow relate to me having an early death. Was found to have 3 out of 5 arteries in my heart with <30% blockage/plaque buildup so doc said I need to watch what I eat and get healthier. Said not to obsess over it but just be mindful.

Weight & height: 81kg before, 72kg after. 172cm. Unsure of body fat percentages 

Diet: Don’t count calories, however I am mindful of what I eat. I’ve eliminated as much butters, saturated fats, sugars and alcohol from my diet as I can without feeling restricted. Eat plenty of fish and chicken as well  as mixed veg. Coffee every day, and yogurt if I want something sweet. Still have the odd wine or ice cream or chocolate.

Nutrition: same as above. I don’t really count macros or anything. Just try to eat fresh produce and whole foods. I do try to incorporate as much protein as I can in each meal though.

Training: weight train 3-4 times per week with mostly muscle building exercises and I really try to focus on body weight stuff like pull ups, chin ups, push ups as well as more focused weight machines. Eat avocado every day, as well as tomato and cucumbers. Apples and bananas every day too, and when it’s hot I’ll eat watermelon instead of apple.

And then, mixed with that, was the pie-spiced apple (thankfully realistic and not saccharine or artificial) and a roasted smokiness that registered to me as a peaty whiskey smell, but is apparently a coffee note.

1i3dy0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1i3dy0f/help_save_the_iconic_bendix_diner_the_1947/,"Help save the iconic Bendix Diner! The 1947 Hasbrouck Heights mainstay was recently shut down for inadequate fire suppression, and a GoFundMe has launched to help blind owner John bring this NJ classic up to code and reopen.","# [LINK TO THE GOFUNDME PAGE](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-john-save-the-bendix-diner-legacy)  

*(note: I am not the creator of the fundraiser.)*



I am sharing this as someone not connected with either the diner owners or the fundraiser starters, but as a Jerseyan proud of the places that give our state its enigmatic character. Vintage diners, like the Bendix, are certainly high ranking symbols of what make this state great and we need to fight to preserve these places amidst an onslaught of Wawas, Walgreens, strip malls and Self Storage facilities.

The news was shared over the weekend here on Reddit— the **Bendix Diner** in Hasbrouck Heights, among the 'old class' of vintage diners in the Garden State, [was forced by code officials to close last week](https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/hasbrouck-heights/2025/01/16/bendix-diner-nj-owner-hasbrouck-heights-works-reopen-shut-down/77719852007/) due to an antiquated fire suppression system. The situation had been long-drawn-out between the town and the Diakakis family (charismatic front-of-house John and his aging mother), and patience finally ran out for the former. It's apparently a beast of a project to adapt the architecture of the 78-year old Master Diner to the current standard for hoods, ventilation and sprinklers.

While a bunch of comments on the original news threads included some snark due to its aging appearance, the Bendix unquestionably typifies what a Jersey Diner is all about—  
generous portions of solid diner fare, cooked in plain view;  
a kind-yet-crass, quick witted wisecracking server (who is also completely blind);  
a guaranteed stream of Cheers-style regulars settling into counter seats on the weekend;  
vintage interior and exterior that reflect irreplaceable character.

Indeed, the Bendix's charm has found its way into everything from music videos by [Bleachers](https://youtu.be/hQE0TrJbPAk?si=z60oNnWK40UfqnIL) and [James Arthur](https://youtu.be/PMGY8fLwess?si=ZoV1HGumM-Aj2QZM), to visits by Jerry Seinfeld on [*Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee*](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6hzil8), to a pair of documentaries by both [The New Yorker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmtOw0gTf2k) and filmmaker [Anthony Scalia](https://vimeo.com/753034415) profiling John.

I've spoken with one of John's sons, and it seems like the future of the diner is of great concern due to the cost and complexity of the fire safety repairs needed. **We need places like this to stick around**. The Rutt's Huts and Hiram's; the White Mannas and Pizza Towns; diners like Angelo's in Glassboro, Summit, and Salem Oak. Places that haven't been homogenized or over-renovated; ones where the staff can be personable and gruff in the same breath; where the history of it all are on full display.

I just don't want to see such a cool and unique place like the Bendix— fronted by an absolute treasure in John Diakakis— disappear. Hoping the GoFundMe is a success provides the help he and his family need to get the diner back on track and the doors open again.",1,1737111828.0,newjersey,0,0.57,False

I'm sweating and my smart watch uto records workouts while on shift.
 But I struggle to not hyper focus on things they leave uncleaned. I'm talking the gaps between the toilet seat and lid. Grime build up on the toilet paper roll holder. Cubby holes that havent been dusted in months. Obvious Soap scum on shower doors (not to mention actual lime sale and soap build up on the bottom of shower glass) Old coffee spills on the fridge, food splatter in the fridge. The caddys that hold the tea and coffee are filthy. Dust they leave behind the tvs. What I call splooges on mirrors and other glass surfaces. These people don't even clean the toilet bowl. They will remove shit stains but wont actually clean the bowl- when i actually use the toilet brush you can see its coming off. My boss told me ""if you can't see it while standing up don't worry about it"" - but while standing inside cleaning the shower you can see from the guests pov that nobody has cleaned the toilet rim for weeks, months maybe.
Anyways I am trying my absolute best and being told it's not good enough. My boss will often leave a shower unwiped a toilet unsanitised.Their main goal is to have fresh linen and towels and everything else goes out the window. The rooms are disgusting. Since working there 2 1 star reviews have been left about things I literally started cleaning but was told not to.
I genuinely like my job. I like that it's physical and keeps my mind busy. I admit that I sometimes wipe things more than once.i admit that I take extra time to get our ill fitting sheets to tuck, or to make sure the bin itself doesn't look like it's covered in splooges. But to me these things are important to maintain guest happiness.
Today I took 1.5hrs longer than I was given to clean 5 rooms, vacuum a hallway and do 3 stay overs. I didn't have everything I needed and had to go to laundry where I couldn't find what was required because they can't aren't on top of ordering or stock taking stock of items needed for rooms. These people will literally fill plunger coffee sachets for rooms that don't have plungers. Instead of finding a clean top cover they use sheets. They tell me to put dirty cover blankets on beds. These covers look like they haven't been washed in months. I would actually use them like told if they were even available but they're not.

Keeping up with artificial intelligence (AI) trends these days feels a bit like trying to sip from a firehose — except the firehose is spewing machine-generated jargon, research papers, and futuristic predictions at warp speed. But fear not, fellow mortal! Staying informed about AI doesn’t have to feel like a full-time job. With a few clever strategies, you can stay ahead of the curve without sacrificing your free time (or your sanity). Let’s break it down, metaphorically, hilariously, and efficiently.

# 1. Subscribe to Curated Newsletters: Your AI Cheat Sheets

Think of newsletters as the CliffsNotes for the AI world. Instead of wading through an ocean of information, these curated gems hand you the juiciest AI updates on a silver platter. It’s like hiring a personal trainer for your brain — except the only heavy lifting you’ll do is clicking “subscribe.”

* [**Jadve AI Blog**](https://jadve.ai/blog): Stay up to date with AI trends, practical use cases, and expert insights. Perfect for marketers, business professionals, and AI enthusiasts looking for actionable AI content.
* [**AlphaSignal**](https://alphasignal.ai/): If you’re the type who enjoys tech talk so dense it could bend spacetime, this one’s for you. It’s like the espresso shot of AI newsletters — short, strong, and guaranteed to wake up your inner nerd.
* **TheSequence**: Imagine a wise AI sage whispering the secrets of cutting-edge research into your ear. That’s this newsletter. Perfect for those who want to sound smarter at parties (or at least on LinkedIn).YouTube isn’t just for cat videos and DIY disasters — it’s also an incredible resource for AI content. Watching AI-focused channels is like attending a TED Talk where the speaker is your cool, tech-savvy friend who makes quantum computing sound as simple as baking cookies.**2. Follow Specialized YouTube Channels: AI, But Make It Visual** 
* **AI Jason**: Imagine if your favorite stand-up comedian also happened to be an AI expert. That’s AI Jason. He’ll make you laugh while explaining why robots may (or may not) steal your job.
* **AI Explained**: This channel is like sitting in a classroom where the professor actually makes sense. No jargon, no headaches — just clear, digestible insights into the latest AI breakthroughs.
* **Two Minute Papers**: Think of it as the SparkNotes for research papers. In two minutes, you’ll go from “What even is this?” to “Wow, I’m basically an AI scholar now.”Watching these channels is like having a Netflix binge session — except instead of rewatching *The Office*, you’re learning about the future of humanity. 
* **The Neuron**: Think of it as your AI gossip column. Who’s making waves? What’s the latest drama in the world of neural networks? The Neuron has you covered. 



# 3. Leverage Social Media Wisely: Turn the Doomscroll Into a Boomscroll

Social media can feel like a chaotic carnival, but with the right approach, it’s also a goldmine for AI insights. The trick? Curate your feed like a picky eater at a buffet.

* **Platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn**: Follow AI researchers, industry leaders, and organizations. It’s like assembling an Avengers team of AI experts, but instead of saving the world, they’re feeding you knowledge nuggets.
* **Join AI Communities**: Reddit and other forums are like the Hogwarts common rooms for AI enthusiasts. You’ll find threads where people debate the ethics of AI, share the latest breakthroughs, and occasionally post memes about ChatGPT trying to write poetry.

**Pro tip**: If you find yourself doomscrolling, just replace the doom with AI updates. Voilà! You’re now “boomscrolling.”

# 4. Use AI-Powered Content Aggregators: Let the Robots Do the Work

Why manually sift through news when you can let AI curate it for you? Tools like Feedly are like having a digital butler who knows exactly what you want to read.

Imagine walking into a library where every book is handpicked just for you. That’s what these aggregators do — they save you from drowning in irrelevant content and serve up only the good stuff. It’s basically AI helping you learn about AI. How meta is that?

# 5. Allocate Dedicated Time Slots: AI Time, But Make It Zen

Catching up on AI news sporadically is like trying to assemble IKEA furniture without the instructions — chaotic and frustrating. Instead, set aside specific time slots during the week for your AI updates.

Picture this: You, a cup of coffee (or tea, no judgment), and 30 minutes of uninterrupted AI reading. It’s like a spa day for your brain. Bonus points if you light a candle and play some lo-fi beats in the background.

# Final Thoughts: Stay Informed, Stay Sane

Keeping up with AI doesn’t have to feel like a chore. With newsletters, YouTube channels, social media, and AI-powered tools, you can stay in the loop without spending hours glued to your screen. It’s all about working smarter, not harder — kind of like how AI itself operates.

So, go forth, subscribe, follow, and curate! And remember: Staying updated on AI trends is less about knowing everything and more about knowing enough to impress your friends at brunch. After all, who doesn’t want to be the person who casually drops,

I find myself constantly annoyed by things being imo overpriced to a point where I can't enjoy them anymore. Example: I am getting an oatmilk coffee and they charge 1$ extra for the plant-based milk. I will go on a rant on how this is outrageous and will have a hard time moving on and enjoying my coffee. Sometimes I think back to this time I was charged 3$ in a restaurant for tap water and will feel angry. 
Rationally, I know that I can't change prices and it's a waste of time and energy to get worked up over it and also, I don't want to feel angry at all, especially not about such insignificant things..however, it still bothers me. I'm not having an angry outburst or being rude to baristas, service workers etc but it takes part of the enjoyment away. It's not even that I can't afford to pay 1$ extra for plant-based milk, it's about the principle, which makes it even more pointless to care about.  

Does anyone have any advice on how to navigate and get rid of my annoyment? 
I'd be happy to hear other viewpoints which might put things in perspective and change how I feel! 

Thank you!",8,1737110625.0,Stoicism,8,0.9,False

We’ve been friends for months, and we’d hang out a lot, texting, chatting, and even going out in groups. I’ve always felt a connection, but I was never sure if he felt the same way.

A few weeks ago, I decided to finally take the plunge and ask him out. It was nerve-wracking, but I felt like if I didn’t do it now, I’d regret it. So, one day after we hung out, I told him I needed to talk to him about something important. I was shaking so bad, I could barely get the words out. But I finally asked if he wanted to grab coffee sometime, just the two of us, and maybe see where things could go.

He paused for a while, and then... he told me he didn’t feel the same way. He said he really liked me as a friend but just wasn’t looking for a relationship right now. He didn’t want to make things awkward between us, but he didn’t feel any romantic spark.

I wasn’t expecting a yes, but hearing it out loud still stung. I guess I was hoping he’d at least say something like, ""Maybe in the future"" or something less definitive, but it wasn’t the case. I smiled and said it was okay, that I understood, and we ended up just awkwardly chatting for a few minutes before parting ways.

I’m trying to be okay with it, but I can’t help feeling a bit heartbroken. I put myself out there, and I guess I’m just a little disappointed. It’s hard, because we’re still friends, and I know things might be a bit awkward for a while. I’m just trying to figure out how to move on from this without letting it affect our friendship.

We could do some day trips from either one. An alternative would be to spend 2-3 nights in an Agroturismo or so with animals, as the kids really love animals. Parents are pretty flexible, we would love to see some museums and historical stuff, but also just eat and have good coffee, walk at the beach, etc.

These two might even want to get into the water (I won't!), but I'm wondering what things they might enjoy at this time of year -- besides pizza, gelato. Are there any particular outings, activities, restaurants, etc. that they might enjoy? 

What day-trips would you recommend? I was thinking Matera, Ostuni, Gallipoli, ideally by train/bus, but I could rent a car too. I understand that some of the smaller places especially those by the water might be very quiet. Thanks for your help!",1,1737110338.0,ItalyTravel,1,0.67,False
1i3dkz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1i3dkz6/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

recently i managed to get a competitive short-term internship alongside my studies. part of this was the opportunity to attend a talk at a university around 2-3hrs from us. including the event and travel, it would only take up one day (a saturday). i get nervous driving places far away by myself, and my parents are away that weekend, so i asked if he would come. he initially refused saying it was 'too boring' for him. when i expressed i felt unsupported (he rarely shows any interest in any of my work, with the exception of asking me how my day was) he started getting defensive. i know maths isn't for everyone, and i don't expect him to learn or understand, but showing a vague bit of interest every now and again would be nice. i listed some of the things i had done for him that weren't particularly interesting to me, but that i wanted to do to support him. he just came back with 'i never asked you to do any of that stuff'. i said that i know he didn't ask me to, but that i wanted to do it all because i wanted to support him, rather than i wanted to do the actual activity itself. 
 it left me feeling really disappointed and let down. eventually he said he would drive with me but not actually attend the event with me - he would go to a coffee shop instead. this upset me further, as it felt like avoiding 'boredom' for a few hours was much more important to him than just sitting there at an event which centres around my area of work. 
i asked if perhaps it was that he didn't want to take the time off work that day (saturday is a busy day in his establishment) but he said it wasn't that as he has plenty of holiday days to take, it was simply that he didnt want to come. 
this made me feel really belittled and unimportant to him, and i think my emotion may have come across as anger. i snapped at him 'i'm not asking you to come because i think you'll enjoy it, im asking you to come because i want support in my degree and what is likely to be my career. i don't care how much you will or won't like it, its about you doing this for me and my work'. i admit i was stroppy (didn't raise my voice, but my tone wasn't pleasant). 
the conversation ended with him still refusing to attend the talk, but now he is spinning it as 'you won't enjoy it as much if i'm sat there visibly bored'. whilst this is partly true, i asked him to 'act' as though he was interested (he has a degree in performing arts after all). 

he then used the example of him being supportive by saying he sat with me at a fast track referral cancer appointment at the hospital. i said to him that whilst ofc i was grateful for him coming, sitting in a waiting room for 20 mins on his day off whilst your gf is tested for cancer felt like the bare minimum when you were in a relationship with someone, and that this has nothing to do with the actual topic of why i am upset. 

my question is: am i overreacting? or just completely wrong and being unfair on him by feeling this way? i feel upset and disappointed that he wouldn't do this for me, but is that valid?
