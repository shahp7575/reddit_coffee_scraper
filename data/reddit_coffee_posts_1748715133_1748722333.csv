# Crafting chatbot prompts

The most serious mistakes are not being made as a result of wrong answers. The true dangerous thing is asking the wrong question. - *Peter Drucker*

\[Start of *Grok*’s response.\]

To get great results from chatbots like *ChatGPT*, treat prompts like instructions to a clever but literal assistant. Here’s a guide to doing it well:

# 1. Master the basics

Prompts should be clear, specific and purposeful.

* Use simple language.
* State the goal, e.g. explain, list, compare.
* Define tone: formal, casual, persuasive.

💬 *Instead of*: *Tell me about history*.  
✅ *Try:* *Summarise key events of World War I in 200 words for a 10 year old.*

# 2. Use the CARE framework

A structure for better prompting:

* **Context**: Who/what is involved?
* **Action**: What should the AI do?
* **Result**: What format/output do you want?
* **Example**: Show a model if possible.

📝 *You’re a nutritionis*t (Context). *Create a 7-day vegetarian meal pla*n (Action) *with calorie counts and recipes, in table forma*t (Result). *Example: Day* 1 – \[sample\].

# 3. Adapt by task

Tweak the structure based on use case:

* **Explain**: *Break down quantum computing using a 12-year-old analogy.*
* **Creative**: *Write a sci-fi story set in 1800s London, humorous tone.*
* **Problem-Solve**: *Suggest 3 marketing ideas under £500.*
* **Analyse**: *Compare hybrid vs remote work using this data:* \[source\].

# 4. Refine iteratively

Don’t settle for vague output. Revise the prompt.

* Add constraints if too broad.
* Rephrase if off-topic.
* Follow up: *Expand point 2* or *Make this more formal.*

# 5. Use advanced strategies

For complex needs, go pro:

* **Chain of Thought**: *Think step-by-step.*
* **Role-Play**: *Act as a salary negotiation coach.*
* **Few-Shot**: Provide 1–2 examples for style guidance.
* **Prompt Chaining**: Break into smaller tasks.

# 6. Avoid common pitfalls

Quick fixes for common issues:

* Too vague? Add specificity.
* Too much? Split into multiple prompts.
* Too unclear? Define terms.
* Too long? Set word or format limits.

# 7. Play with tone

Match the output to your vibe.

* Fun: *Write a poem about coffee, Dr. Seuss style.*
* Formal: *Apologise for a delay via email.*
* Persuasive: *Argue for solar in TED Talk style.*

# 8. Give feedback

The AI learns from nudges.

* *Too formal - make it friendlier.*
* *Not fantasy - use historical fiction.*
* Save good prompts for future use.

# 9. Use prompt templates

Versatile starting points:

* *Explain* \[topic\] *simply, with 2 real-world examples.*
* *Generate* \[n\] *ideas for* \[task\], *each tailored to* \[audience\].
* *Compare* \[option A\] *vs* \[B\] *by* \[criteria\], *in table form.*

# 10. Experiment

Prompting is a skill. Have fun.

* Try weird ideas: *Rap battle between Einstein and Newton.*
* Keep a prompt journal.
* Ask AI to critique itself: *How could this be better?*

With these strategies, you’ll write better prompts and get better responses.

\[End of *Grok*’s response.\]

# Two questions for you

1. What would you change about *Grok*’s response?
2. Do you know anyone who might be interested in a chatbot prompt assistant?

1l0699w,https://chatgpt.com/share/683b60fe-e09c-8001-b04b-9482b98bc0d0,The Difference Between Microeconomics and Macroeconomics,"**Big‑picture idea**

* **Microeconomics** zooms in on the *trees*—the choices made by individual people, households, firms, and how those choices interact in a single market (like coffee, apartments, or smartphones).
* **Macroeconomics** steps back to see the *forest*—the behaviour of the economy as a whole: growth, unemployment, inflation, recessions, and the policies governments use to influence those broad outcomes.

---

### Microeconomics in plain English

Think of micro as the study of “how much” questions for specific buyers and sellers:

| Question                                                                  | What micro looks at                                                                     | Everyday example                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **“If the price of lattes goes up, will I still buy one every morning?”** | Your personal demand curve and the coffee shop’s supply curve.                          | You notice the price jumped to \$7 and decide to brew at home; the shop sees sales drop and runs a promotion. |
| **“Should a local bakery hire one more worker?”**                         | The bakery compares the extra wages with the extra revenue from selling more pastries.  | The owner crunches numbers and hires a part‑timer only on weekends when demand surges.                        |
| **“Why is rent higher downtown than in the suburbs?”**                    | How limited space (supply) and location convenience (demand) set the equilibrium price. | A one‑bed downtown costs \$1,600; a similar unit 20 min away is \$1,100 because more land is available there. |

Other micro topics: price discrimination (student discounts), game theory (two gas stations on the same corner), externalities (your neighbour’s late‑night drum practice), and market failures (why we have anti‑trust laws).

---

### Macroeconomics in plain English

Macro asks questions that require adding up *everyone’s* choices:

| Question                                                    | What macro looks at                                                                      | Everyday example                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **“Is the economy growing this year?”**                     | Gross Domestic Product (GDP) trends.                                                     | News reports say GDP grew 2 % last quarter—businesses are producing more goods and services overall.                         |
| **“Why are grocery prices rising so fast?”**                | Inflation—the average price level across thousands of goods.                             | You notice a \$4 carton of eggs is now \$5; the statistical agency shows overall inflation at 4 % per year.                  |
| **“What happens if the central bank cuts interest rates?”** | How cheaper borrowing can boost investment and consumer spending, lowering unemployment. | Mortgage rates fall, people refinance, construction firms break ground on new houses, hiring goes up.                        |
| **“Can government spending pull us out of a recession?”**   | Fiscal stimulus—tax cuts or infrastructure projects to raise overall demand.             | During a downturn, Congress passes a large highway‑repair bill; contractors hire workers who then spend more in local shops. |

Other macro topics: exchange rates and trade deficits, public debt, business cycles, long‑run productivity growth, and the design of central‑bank policy.

---

### The link between them

Micro decisions *add up* to macro outcomes. If millions of households cut back on lattes, micro tells us coffee sales fall; macro might show a broader consumer‑spending slowdown that drags on GDP growth. Likewise, a macro policy (say, raising interest rates) filters down to micro choices—higher loan costs make that bakery think twice about buying a new oven.

---

**Rule of thumb**

* When the unit of analysis is *one market, one business, one household*, you’re in micro territory.
* When the unit of analysis is *an entire country or the global economy*, you’re in macro territory.

Both perspectives are essential; together they help us understand everything from the price of a single avocado to the ripple effects of a global financial crisis.

    I’m 55 years old and have suffered from chronic bad breath since 2005. I’ve tried everything—doctors, specialists, diets, supplements—but nothing worked beyond a few days. Every “cure” seemed promising at first but stopped working within 2–3 days. I now believe people should wait at least two weeks before claiming something is a real fix.
    
    
    ⸻
    What I’ve Tried
        •   Doctors: 5 dentists, 1 periodontist, 3 GI specialists, 2 ENT doctors
        •   Alternative Medicine: Naturopaths, countless supplements/probiotics, natural remedies
        •   Diet: Tried multiple extreme diets (some unsustainable)
        •   Allergies: Completed allergy injection therapy
        •   Mouth hygiene tools: All standard tools including tongue scrapers, rinses, etc.
    
    
    ⸻
    Symptoms
        •   Chronic bad breath: Confirmed by ex-wife and others—this wasn’t in my head.
        •   Nasal breath odor: Eventually, odor began escaping through my nose even when I wasn’t speaking.
        •   PATM (People Allergic To Me): People around me (even from a distance) would cough, clear their throats, or gasp when I breathed. I could reproduce this effect by breathing deeply at my desk—by the third breath, coworkers reacted.
    
    
    ⸻
    What Worked (Finally)
    I stumbled across a medical paper discussing how oral mucosal biofilm contributes to halitosis. Researchers used a prototype micro-mist spray device to remove this biofilm.
    https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-021-01647-4
    Since I already had a WaterPik (water flosser), I decided to replicate this method manually. Previously, I had only used it on my gumline, as instructed. This time, I extended irrigation to all surfaces of the mouth—gums, cheeks, mucosa, tongue, under the tongue, between lips and gums—essentially everywhere except the back of the throat.
    
    
    Full Routine
        1.  Brush teeth (2 minutes)
        2.  Scrape tongue
        3.  WaterPik irrigation:
        •   Use two full tanks (22 oz / 621 ml each)
        •   Pressure level: 5 (moderate)
        •   Keep mouth open, let water flow out (don’t hold it)
        •   Do this twice a day, especially before bed and in the morning
        •   First tank: Gumline, gums, cheeks, inner lips, mucosa
        •   Second tank: Palate, tongue, under tongue, tonsil area
        •   ⚠️ Avoid spraying the back of the throat – very painful
    
    
    ⸻
    Results
        •   Noticeable improvement in 3 days
        •   Zero symptoms for 4 weeks now
        •   Diet: No restrictions, even drinking coffee (which used to worsen it)
        •   Other benefits: Bad taste in mouth gone; significant improvement in dry eczema/psoriasis on hands
    
    
    ⸻
    Why I Think It Works
    This is just my personal opinion: Bacteria aren’t only on teeth—they live all over the mouth. The WaterPik acts like a pressure washer to dislodge biofilm from the entire oral cavity, not just the gumline. This might explain why it’s so effective where other treatments failed.
    
    ⸻
    For Those Who Already Own a Water Flosser:
    Give this a try—you’ve got nothing to lose. Just be gentle and don’t aim at the back of your throat.
    
    For Those Who Don’t:
    Hold off on buying one right away. Wait and see what kind of feedback this post gets from others who try it.

    TL;DR:
    I’ve suffered from persistent bad breath (including nasal breath and PATM) for nearly 20 years. After trying countless treatments with no lasting results, I found a solution by using my WaterPik (water flosser) to irrigate my entire oral cavity—not just the gumline. I’ve been symptom-free for 4 weeks. This method mimics a study that used a micro-mist spray to remove oral mucosa biofilm. Full routine and details below.",1,1748721577.0,badbreath,0,1.0,False

It's always the same, and it always ends at the exact same moment. I don't think I'm myself in this dream, maybe it's me in the future? Or someone in a different reality? Someone else in the future? I know that sounds stupid, but I just don't know anymore. I decided to write it down last week; (I can remember every detail, I've been having it for months now), after all, maybe it just needed to get out of my system. But after I did, the dream became way more real, more...lucid? More details came, and I just knew them intuitively. No one in the dream told me. And...I was able to hear his thoughts. Whenever I'm watching this from, whoever is on this mission...I don't know, I've always loved space, the Final Frontier, but ever since I've had this dream now all of it makes me feel so - empty. Listening to his thoughts, feeling what he saw...the thought of going anywhere but our atmosphere terrifies me now. Any similar experiences or help would be much appreciated. I tried to write all of the details as I remembered them, and the thoughts and feelings I was having while it happened, so sorry if it reads weird. I really need any help you can give. 

Kindest Regards,

The snap of a camera.

The squeeze of a daughter. 

The laughter of a friend.

Next person.

Bright lights, excited faces. 

Next one. She’s pretty.

The man of the hour adjusts his gloves and moves his helmet to the other leg.

“Is it heavy?”

A glance at the gleaming white and obsidian visor. An idea came laughing to the mind.

“Wanna try it?” The ditzy brunette, the last in a once long line, gasps in mock appreciation.

“Oh my gosh of course!!”

More laughter behind the camera. She sits on the empty leg and pats a spacesuit. 

“Oh my gosh it’s so squishy!!”

Behind the camera, two black suits.

“Everything ready?”

“Everything. Fueled, prepped, waiting for launch. He’ll literally walk right up to the ship after this.”

 “And the data trackers?”

“Computers synced, Sensors primed, timers started, we’ll be able to account for any relativity- look, the time to be worried was days ago, why are you asking this now?”

“Just making sure all the variables are in control. He’s our X factor.”

“Who, the Major?”

“Yes. He’s never been to space before.”

A scoff. “And I’d never driven on a highway before I merged. He’ll be fine.”

“What about the readings we just got? Are we sure about doing this today, with that...I don't know, that anomaly?”

“All the sims came back fine, he should completely miss it. All evidence points to our man coming home safe.” 

“But no spacecraft has ever been through a flare, not like this.”

“The orbit is going directly around the anomaly, he won’t even notice it. No need to abort.”

“I’m just saying, anything can happen. We barely know our own ocean, let alone eternal nothingness.”

A shrug. “Fair enough.”

A flash, a smile, and the Major was standing.

“Thank you.” He stuck out his hand to be shaken, only to be sent off with a kiss.

“Not sure I’ve earned it, but…thank you.”

“Ready to go sir?”

“Born ready Captain.”

Two suits and a Major exit the room, and one leaves the world behind. 

\*\*\*\*

The Major stepps out of the elevator. Unfeeling steel closes behind him.

He finds himself standing alone on the catwalk to his shuttle.

Stepping in, he buckles, shuts the door to the atmosphere and braces. He was about to leave it, for the first time, and maybe even for the last.

What an unhelpful thought.

Crackling static. 

“Ground control is a go, Major do you copy?”

“Loud and clear Ground Control.”

“Major, notice anything abnormal in the cockpit?”

“Negative Ground Control, everything looks good.” 

“Copy Major, stand by for takeoff orders.”

Heavy breathing. The Major zones out. 

A new frontier was about to be conquered, in the name of science. For the first time in history, a human being was set to walk the vacuum of space for a full twenty four hours. 

In the name of science.

With nothing but 2 inches of padding between the Major’s body and infinite nothingness, he would collect the data, measure the photons, track the force of gravity, and time himself to observe the immutable law of relativity and its effects the human frame hurtling around Earth at 1,700 miles per hour. 

For twenty four hours.

For science.

Sweat beaded down. He needed to calm himself. 

“Major Tom to Ground Control.”

“Major Tom this is Ground Control, go.”

“I’m too sober for this, why don’t you send me up a drink?”

Quiet laughter. 

“Negative Major, all our champagne is already popped.”

A tense, smiling sigh. Oh well.

Deep breaths.

He thought about his wife.

He wished he was with her.

The radio reignites.

“Ground control go, systems ready. Major begin the countdown.”

“Controls are live, ignition key.”

The roar of the engines.“Four, three, two, one.”

\*\*\*\*\*

Silence.



Blackness.



Earth sparkling beneath.



A Major gripping a railing.  


One slip of the foot, gone.



One missed hand grab, gone. 



One overcorrection, gone. The void would accept the sacrifice. 



Flying over the edge of nothing gives one the impression that everything doesn’t matter. 



“Ground control, are you gettin’ this?”

“Affirmative, Major. Data collecting, stabilizers engaging.”



A slight jerk, Momentary panic. 



“Stabilizers are a go, you are free to navigate the hull. How do you feel, Major?”



Grip re-established. Deep breaths. 



“I’m OK, I’m uh…I’m getting cold, how long have I been out here?”

“Eastern time reads approximately oh three hundred, our timer shows one hour fifty-six minutes. Your vitals are holding steady, life support ready if anything happens. You’re doing good Major.”

“OK, hoo...ok good. I’m going to climb up top, take a look out.”



The frontier conqueror climbed the starboard side of his ship.



Swinging a leg over the railing, magnetic shoes hold his place on the hull.



The Major allows the Gs to stand his body upward as he watches his home.



Earth. Home. 

Shades of blue, white, brown, green. 



A shiny marble.

Everything he had ever known. 

Everything he had ever felt. 

Everyone he had ever loved, hated or had never met, living or dead. 



Miles and miles and forevers below. 



Upwards.

The Sun. 



All his light, all his hope, all the light and hope of everyone he’d ever known…every yesterday, every tomorrow we can never call our own…



Beaming mercilessly, blindingly white into a man’s eyes.



A lost man.



A lonely man. 



A worthless man?



What was it all for?

We struggle, bleed, and die amongst the dust only to find that no one was watching. 



Nobody ever was. 



Hundreds of years, metric tons of dust and dirt and war and strife, and no one to regard. Fighting against endless currents, torrential downpour, merciless elements and against impossible odds, loving, living, choking, dying, losing and losing and losing…just to find our arena was barely small enough to notice from space and our story set in a marble deep in the ocean.



This spacewalk was no win, no step forward.

This data would change nothing.

Hundreds of years from now, thousands and tens of thousands of years will press ahead, and nothing would be there to remember from our latest loss.

The continents will sink, the air will vaporize, and the marble will fall into the Sun. 

And then one day after that, the Sun will submit to the void currently suffocating the lonely man, and soon after the Universe itself will become the nothingness it filled. 

We can’t stop any of that from happening.

When it all does happen, there will be nothing to remember us.

Will my wife even remember me, or I her, even fifty years from now?

She was six months pregnant. She and the baby could die tomorrow. 

Would that be worth remembering?



What if my son should live?

Would he do something God can remember?



Will God remember us?



We’re helpless on our own. 

We are so fragile.



We can hardly breathe in our own marble. 



Breathe Major. 

Breathe.



Alarms. 



“Major!”



A forceful jerk. 



The sensation of falling.



The ship getting away.



The relentless pull of nothingness.



Breathe, please, breathe.



The tether is still attached.



Snap, Ching. A cable drifts away.



The embrace of nothingness. 



Breathe, Breathe.



Pulling, 



Breathe,



Pulling and pulling, a man is forced to fall. 



Breathe.



Breathe.



Oh God, please breathe. 



Breathe.



Gasp.



Gasping.



Gasping, struggling, pleading. 

  
Flying, spinning, stabilizing.  


Drifting, falling.



Floating, weightless...



Worthless. 



\*\*\*\*\*



“Telescope lost visual.”  
“Is he on the ship?!” “Negative, no sign of him.”  
“Is he tethered?!” “Negative, the cable reached full extension before snapping.”    
“A solid steel cable snapped?!” “I don’t know, his orbit could have drifted, it could be the force fro -”“GET HIM ONLINE, COMMUNICATIONS GO!”

“Ground Control to Major Tom, this is Ground control to Major Tom. Are you receiving?""

  


“Goddammit, Auxiliaries try general broadcast, get international to broadcast all channels. All signals - GET ME INTERNATIONAL-”

“Ground Control Major Tom - Major are you receiving?”



“Major, do you read -”

Crackling.

“Major. Major, do you read me?!”

Louder crackling.







“Give - my wife - my love.”



  








“Major, Major Tom, we lost you for a moment, do you read me?”

“We’re not getting any signals, his vitals cut out.”   
“Major, are you receiving?”

“Major, can you hear me?”



“Major, are you receiving?”

  


Major, are you receiving? 



“Not responding.”



“Oh [No...no](http://no...no/).”



\*\*\*\*\*



“Time?”

“Eleven hundred thirty.”

Drained coffee cup, pursed lips.

An unwanted question.

“When do we tell the press?”

An answerless pause. 

A captain’s reluctant sigh, an empty coffee cup.

An intern continues. 

“We cut the livestream at three hundred oh seven. The public already knows. All we can do is make it official.”

A captain nods, a friend forsakes hope. 

“Ready the press box. I’ll appear in fifteen.”

The world prepares to mourn.

\*\*\*\*\*

Spinning, falling, floating. 

Gasping, straining, turning.

Cold. Dark. Endless.

Blinding light, a glimmering object disrupting the void.

The Major’s ship peeked around the Earth. 

A deep breath, a sigh.

He was hurtling towards hope.

Across an empty horizon, a cable drifting in the nothing, a silver line of hope.

Deep breaths, anticipation…

A smile fades.

Too close. 

Clang against the ship, spinning for a severed hope, a cut.

Cold metal opens solid rubber, tearing thin flesh.



A scream. 



Life support; a suit seals off the nothing.

Losing feeling, blood stopping. 

An arm lost.

Breathe...breathe...breathe.

Spinning. 

Drifting. Falling.







Hours.





  


Getting cold. 



Give up. 



A glance at the light. 



The Sun…Bright, constant, piercing…The Sun...The Son...



My son. 



Unwavering. 



Unyielding.



Guiding. 



No giving up.



“Major Tom to ground control.”

Silence.  
“Major Tom to ground control, do you read?”  
Nothing.

“I’m coming home. Do you hear me? Does anyone read me?”

Defiant silence.  
  
“I’m coming home, OK? I PROMISE!!”

A final hope around the horizon, five miles a second.

“I AM COMING HOME.”



An arm outstretched, a steel thread coming into view again.

A lonely man, a future father. 

Earth below him, drifting, falling,



Floating, weightless,



Calling coming home. ",1,1748721492.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1l06272,https://i.redd.it/mppwi9ysa64f1.jpeg,"BOLO- Missing Backpacker Bret Valona  ( Seaside, FL )","Bret Valona has been missing since March 1st, but if anyone is still alive after possibly being lost in the woods it would be Bret. He is a trained wilderness medic, farrier, survivalist, and ex marine who even trained with the New Mexico State wolf program. He was seen near the Watercolor area of Seaside the evening of March 2nd but may have ventured back onto any of the state park trails in the area (Grayton Beach, Eastern Lake, Washington Point State Forest, etc.)

I spoke to Bret's family the other day after being connected by United Cajun Navy who I work alongside from time to time. The love his family has for him is something you don't come across very often when helping with missing persons. I've felt drawn to help them where I can and I hope ya'll do too.

Bret seemed to be living a sort of 'vagabond' lifestyle and believed in leaving no trace behind on his adventures. He recently mentioned the desire to live in Hawail or even Guam. He traveled often and had no problem being resourceful or living off the land for some solitude and peace. He lived in New Mexico for four years where he attended farrier school as well as training with the wolf program. Bret eventually moved to Houston working construction for some time.

After speaking with his sister, Ashley, about the desire to visit or even move to Florida she invited him to join on vacation with her family when they drive down from Wisconsin. He agreed and took a greyhound bus from Houston to Destin, FL. Bret then made his way hiking on foot(not uncommon for him) to Blue Mountain Beach, meeting up with his sister and her family for a week long vacation.
Afterwards, he vocalized wanting to camp at Washington Point Forest, FL. It wasn't unusual for him to go off trekking on his own adventures, but he also had never been to Florida before. 

They dropped him off at the Eastern Lake Trailhead on March 1st at 4pm after grabbing supplies (including a sandwich) at the local Publix. On March 2nd she sort of had a feeling she should call him, but that evening his cell phone was unable to receive calls after Verizon disconnected the line due to non payment. He may not have been aware it was due since it was a new cell phone.

No one has heard from him since, which is unlike him. You see, many years ago Ashley became concerned when she hadn't from her brother and after finally reaching him he promised he would always check in within 3 weeks and since then he always has. They had a sort of 'pact' between them.

She remembers before taking him to the trailhead that he had a desire of getting to the beach and eventually somewhere new. He wanted a new start and has sort of been trying to find his place and somewhere he truly enjoys being. She misses her brother dearly and only wants to know that he is okay.

Bret may have sought passage via boat to another country or even just for exploration. He was sighted late in the evening March 3rd near the Watercolor Beach Bar and Grill. He also purchased a coffee at Bad Azz Coffee near Grayton Beach (date unknown rn). United Cajun Navy searched with the assistance of kgs April 24th, 25th, and the 26th with zero sign of Bret. He could be anywhere but as of right now we're hoping the locals and tourists keep an eye out and continue looking for Bret.

-I have been checked tagged locations on instagram by date near Watercolor Beach and Grayton Beach including the trails and parks. I have also been checking YouTube uploads by date to see if there's any trace of him. So far nothing and the ones I have asked haven't seen him or didn't see him around that time.
There have also been fairly large black bear spotted in the watercolor area.",2,1748721487.0,30A,0,1.0,False

I’m looking for an outside opinion on if I handled a terrible roommate situation right. This is pretty long so thank you if you read and can give feedback!

 My former roommate and I (both mid/late 20s F) had been living together for 3 years. We were work friends and she had asked to move in with me when she got frustrated with her old landlord. We lived together without much conflict for a while but about a year ago I started feeling like there was more tension. We are both busy with work and she was under a lot of pressure, so I thought her shortness wasn’t about me and tried to be a good roommate without taking it personally (keep shared areas clean, being respectful of noise, etc). There were a few times that I didn’t clean things how she wanted and she started leaving notes telling me what I was doing wrong (I thought she wanted an area in the bathroom sink cleaned extra well but she wanted it scrubbed in the kitchen). I tried my best to keep stuff clean when I understood what she wanted and when she didn’t clean areas that I care about I just did it myself instead of adding onto the tension. I thought that would help deescalate things but I was wrong.

We still worked together, and everything seemed fine at work so I though it was just me not understanding something or mistaking her being tired for her being mad at me. There were also a few times where I would come how and she had removed furniture that I use (owned by the apartment not either of us) and replaced it with new items without any heads up of discussion. Or she would “decorate” with random pine tree branches she found outside for Christmas hanging them from fire sprinklers. I tried to bring up that it was a fire hazard (as she has left burning candles without anyone in the apartment with our cats multiple times) as well as a flooding hazard if the sprinkler head breaks off from having things hung on it and she said I was overreacting and making a problem out of nothing.

A few months ago, she decided suddenly to move in with her partner several months before our joint lease was up. We talked about it when she told me and she asked if I would be ok with her finding someone new to take over her rent. I said I totally understood and was fine as long as they are ok with my cat and if I got meet the new person before things were signed. She agreed that those requests were completely reasonable and started looking for someone to sublease. After looking for less than 2 weeks, she was getting desperate (her words) and offered a discounted rate (less than rent and not charging utilities) to a man looking for an apartment for his wife. The main problem with this situation is that I was not allowed to talk to his wife or contact her in any way before she was set to move into the apartment \~ 1 month later. I was hurt by this and told her that it felt like she never cared what I requested since she stopped respecting it as soon as it become inconvenient for her. She never responded to this message.

To add more stress to this situation, there were some concerning red flags beyond not being allowed to contact this person. New roommate’s husband told us that his wife wasn’t comfortable with my boyfriend coming over to the apartment but that he would be in the apartment every day for breakfast and dinner. Additionally, I found out after ex roommate signed over the lease that the new roommate and her husband were an arranged marriage and had met \~2 months ago but that he had been back in the US for school for the last month. They had never lived together, she had never been to the country that we live and I wasn’t allowed to contact her because her living in the apartment would be a visa violation and her husband didn’t want any records on her phone that could be found by immigration officers. My ex-roommate didn’t see any issue with this situation and said I was being judgmental when I brought up that the husband didn’t even know his wife yet and that I have to live with someone that no one in the situation really knew yet.

Some additional context is that I am also gender queer. The new roommate is from a country where queer people are frequently murdered by family or executed by the government for being queer. I wasn’t able to talk to the new roommate or her husband about if she was comfortable living with a queer person before paperwork was singed and definitely didn’t want to out myself after we were already living together when I met new roommate. I tried bringing this up to ex roommate and she didn’t respond other than to say “it seemed like I had a lot going on” and implied I was over reacting to a normal situation because of it.

The new roommate did eventually move, and I tried to be friendly and open in hopes that the red flags were associated with her husband and maybe she and I could find a situation that works for us now that we could talk and make a plan for living together. I think it’s normal to talk to a roommate to make a plan on how you’ll handle fridge space, kitchen cabinets and personal/shared items like dishes, utensils and appliances. If that’s not normal or just an American thing please let me know. I tried to bring up how she wanted to split the bathroom and kitchen space and she just said everything is fine. I think there was also a language barrier issue, and she was probably tired from travel so I figured I would wait until the weekend and try to talk then once she could settle in. That did not go well for me either. 

After moving in on Thursday, we talked a bit getting to know each other before I made my first request about shared spaces. The front door of the apartment doesn’t latch well, and you have to deadbolt it or the door will blow open. She had left it unlocked a few times on Thursday and Friday so I asked that she always lock the door since my cat could run outside and get lost or someone could just walk in to rob us or if the door blows open. I thought we were both on the same page after that and things were starting out fine.

Saturday morning I was woken up by her and her husband in the kitchen talking and walking around in shoes and repeatedly opening the door and letting it slam before 6:00 am. I was kind of expecting this because this was during Ramadan and I didn’t know if one or both of them would be fasting and need to eat before sunrise (Before and after this time I saw both of them eating and drinking during the day so I don’t think this actually was for Suhoor in hindsight). I texted later that morning when I got up and asked if she could try to be more quiet early in the morning specifically only asking that they not where loud shoes and don’t let the door slam just to help with noise. I also asked that she not fold up wet rags so that they wouldn’t get moldy in the humid area we live in and that she not use my bath towel (there’s two towel racks but she didn’t have towel in the bathroom and mine was wet and hanging differently when I went to use it). She apologized and said she would keep the noise down so I thought everything was fine.

Later that evening (2.5 days after moving in) her husband sent me a text saying that I needed to stop making “constant commands”. He accused me of trying to take advantage of her since she was new in the country and that if I didn’t stop talking to her they would report me to the landlord. At this point I fully panicked again. I thought things were off to an ok start and that we just needed to try and understand each other and communicate but I was really scared to talk to her if what I though was common roommate conversations about shared spaces was perceived as taking advantage her. (I can add screen shots of messages if that would help). I tried clarifying that I was just asking and wasn’t trying to be rude and asked him to explain how I was taking advantage so I could stop making her uncomfortable. He didn’t respond so I tried to talk to them when they got back to the apartment that night but her husband said everything was fine I just need to not make commands which just confused me more. She didn’t respond at all even though I was talking to her, her husband would respond. I don’t know if this was a language barrier or if he didn’t want her talking to me. This conversation was less than 1 minute.

I stayed in my room all weekend and only left to use the bathroom when I could hear that no one else was around. I tried to stay out of the way so that no one could be mad or mistake what I said as rude. On Monday I went to the landlord to let them know about the situation incase new roommates husband tried to report me for anything. I told the landlord that I was looking for somewhere new to live since I didn’t feel safe with new roommate’s husband threatening to report me, and I didn’t know how to keep things from escalating when I felt like me words were being taken differently than how I intended. The landlord ended up talking to the new roommate which I think freaked them out (again, her living there was a visa violation and that might be why they were on edge?). The landlord also contacted my old roommate and they decided to release new roommate from the lease. I was told that the new roommate would be out by the weekend but on Monday, new roommate was still there. The landlord started calling around trying to figure out why the key hadn’t been turned in over the weekend. I don’t know what all happened between the landlord, old roommate and new roommate after that but when I came back to the apartment late Monday night, new roommate and almost all of her things were gone.

She and her husband had left all of the lights in the apartment on so I turned them out when I got home. Within 30 seconds of turning the lights off, I got a text from new roommates husband asking if I was home and if he could come to the apartment to give me the key. This scared me. They were supposed to give the key to the landlord and the fact that he messaged so fast when I turned out the lights made me think that he was watching the apartment and was waiting to get me alone late at night. I immediately got back in my car and drove back to work where I could lock myself in my office. Then texted him back that I had only been home to grab something but wasn’t there anymore and directed him to give the key to the landlord. I haven’t seen him or his wife since and I have no idea what happened.

I feel fairly confident that I didn’t do anything that would justify new roommate or her husband treating me like that. What I don’t understand and might have messed up is something with my old roommate and friend. I told my old roommate (who I though was still a friend) about how strange the situation was, and that I though husband had been watching the apartment. Old roommate was very cold and blew me off saying I was just over reacting again over nothing. I tried to explain how I was feeling about things and that I was hurt that it felt like she was prioritizing getting out of paying rent and living free with her partner over my safety. She apologized but said she didn’t see the problem with any of it. After all of this, I was pretty sure that old roommate didn’t see or care about me as a friend anymore. She stopped responding to any group chats I was in and hasn’t made any effort to hang out or get lunch/coffee like we used to. This hurt but it was clear she didn’t care about me so I have sort of given up on the relationship. 

The new thing that is also hurting and confusing now is that several of our mutual friends have stopped responding to any of my messages. I didn’t want to bash my old roommate to them so I didn’t bring it up to most of them other than 1 who had been asking about the situation (we still talk like normal). I don’t understand what I did wrong but it feels like it must have been something if multiple people I though I was close with are no longer talking to me. None of them have even asked me about the situation so I am not sure if old roommate told them things about me or if I missed something that makes me clearly a problem here. I’m bringing this up now because someone that I though was a really close friend came back to town recently to see my old roommate and didn’t even tell me she was around. This mutual friend has been busy so it could be that she just didn’t have time to catch up but I also checked our messages and noticed that she hasn’t responded to any snaps or memes I’ve sent since she was in town to visit old roommate a week ago. So is my old roomate right? Did I just over react to a bunch of normal roomate things and mess up her finding someone to take over her rent?  Or did I just make poor choices about who my friends are and who to live with?  I could really use advice because I am at a loss.",1,1748721411.0,badroommates,0,1.0,False
1l06136,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnMap/comments/1l06136/ten_tips_to_write_prompts_that_make_chatbots_shine/,Ten tips to write prompts that make chatbots shine,"I prompted the AI chatbot *Grok* with the following question:

*If you were a human, trying to get the best output from ChatGPT and other AI chatbots, how would you want to be guided to create suitable prompts?*

I wanted to understand:

1. How I could get better chatbot results by asking good questions.
2. If there is an opportunity for me to develop an AI chatbot prompt assistant that enabled me and others to get high quality answers.

*Grok*’s response is shown below.

# Crafting chatbot prompts

The most serious mistakes are not being made as a result of wrong answers. The true dangerous thing is asking the wrong question. - *Peter Drucker*

\[Start of *Grok*’s response.\]

To get great results from chatbots like *ChatGPT*, treat prompts like instructions to a clever but literal assistant. Here’s a guide to doing it well:

# 1. Master the basics

Prompts should be clear, specific and purposeful.

* Use simple language.
* State the goal, e.g. explain, list, compare.
* Define tone: formal, casual, persuasive.

💬 *Instead of:* *Tell me about history.*  
✅ *Try:* *Summarise key events of World War I in 200 words for a 10 year old.*

# 2. Use the CARE framework

A structure for better prompting:

* **Context**: Who/what is involved?
* **Action**: What should the AI do?
* **Result**: What format/output do you want?
* **Example**: Show a model if possible.

📝 *You’re a nutritionist* (Context). *Create a 7-day vegetarian meal plan* (Action) *with calorie counts and recipes, in table format* (Result). *Example: Day 1* – \[sample\].

# 3. Adapt by task

Tweak the structure based on use case:

* **Explain**: *Break down quantum computing using a 12-year-old analogy.*
* **Creative**: *Write a sci-fi story set in 1800s London, humorous tone.*
* **Problem-Solve**: *Suggest 3 marketing ideas under £500.*
* **Analyse**: *Compare hybrid vs remote work using this data:* \[source\].

# 4. Refine iteratively

Don’t settle for vague output. Revise the prompt.

* Add constraints if too broad.
* Rephrase if off-topic.
* Follow up: *Expand point 2* or *Make this more formal.*

# 5. Use advanced strategies

For complex needs, go pro:

* **Chain of Thought**: *Think step-by-step.*
* **Role-Play**: *Act as a salary negotiation coach.*
* **Few-Shot**: Provide 1–2 examples for style guidance.
* **Prompt Chaining**: Break into smaller tasks.

# 6. Avoid common pitfalls

FLAXSEED PROTEINS, including albumins, globulins, glutelin, and prolamins, possess anti-cancer properties. They inhibit cancer cell proliferation, induce apoptosis, and interfere with cancer cell signaling pathways, ultimately leading to the inhibition of metastasis. Flaxseed proteins also modulate cancer cell mechanobiology, leading to changes in cell behavior and reduced cancer cell migration and invasion. Studies funded by the Russian Academy of Sciences and published in 2023 detail a comprehensive analysis of the role played by flaxseed proteins and their subcomponents in protection against cancer growth and metastasis.

Upgrade to paid The sickest people on the planet are concentrated in one country, ranked the richest in the world: the United States. Why? Because regular Americans have been systematically poisoned for generations. Abuse of the people by the government supposed to represent them has been tuned to a deadly art. This art is now being exported globally in an overarching net of coercive control. None of this would have been possible without the role of three letter agencies, corporate lobbyists, and political flunkeys. As early as the 1930’s, the conservative French writer, Georges Bernanos, identified the leading role of US corporations in the degradation of Western civilization. His analysis turned out to be prescient in the extreme.

Georges Bernanos, 1888-1948 The destructive effect of mRNA jabs, not least in triggering turbo cancers, is now evident. But these effects must be examined in context not in isolation. The entire collective terrain (US landmass) has been contaminated. From groundwater to topsoil all the way up into the ionosphere.

HAARP systems have caused disturbances in the electrically charged upper layer of Earth’s atmosphere known as the ionosphere. Holes have appeared correlating with a drastic reduction of electron density at night. These anomalies are subsequent to sudden stratospheric warming events. Sudden shifts in stratospheric temperature result from human manipulation not nature. Since the ionosphere functions as a electrical capacitor - regulator of life processes at ground level, these disturbances will doubtless have significant impacts on human health inclusive of gene expression. Interference and more interference Before Warpspeed and the unleashing of mRNA technology, the leading causes of death in the US were: cardiovascular disease, cancer, dementia, and “medical error”. We can now see clearly that all four have spiked upward since the jab.

One thing that has become clearer to people is that “medical error” is itself a misnomer. Error or design? When doctors lack integrity they set up revolving doors between “error” and “design”. Another way of saying this is grift. Or, in politer terms, professional perks. A level above grift is graft. That pretty much explains everything.

Except for bleary-eyed normies popping their blue pills, most people now clearly see pharmaceutical medicine as weaponized. In the Covid era, medical doctors have some very serious charges to answer for. Except for the mindlessly compliant or cognitively impaired, those still capable of mental functioning are fearful and wary of all things “medical”. We now live in the age of medical tyranny. And there are few places on earth more dangerous today than a hospital in the US.

You are what you eat So what part does diet play in the sickness industry, especially cancer? Hippocrates, forefather of Western medicine said:

“Let food be thy medicine, medicine thy food.”

Why is the worst food in the world served up in American hospitals? Why do oncologists tell their patients that changing their diet will have no influence whatsoever on their health?

In this essay I want to explore how any ordinary person can take simple dietary methods to prevent or even heal from cancer. And how this same approach will also benefit your heart and brain, offering protection from the heinous effects of the jab and shedding. It starts with what we eat.

However, given the fact that all food, including organic, has, to a greater of lesser extent been contaminated, how can we actually do what Hippocrates prescribes?

In these times, how can the average person find a simple and inexpensive dietary approach to safeguard themselves from cancer? We need to look at current studies as well as history. This kind of life-saving information is always gaslit, in other words, “fact checked”.

Image credit: Santa Maria Times First, learn to think clearly We tend to believe the more complicated something is, the more advanced it must be. Yet the greatest discoveries throughout history are deceptively simple. Einstein’s energy equation is a case in point.

Elegance combined with simplicity encodes complexity.

All great and powerful things follow this golden rule. Think of the wheel: it is just a circle tipped on its side. How much mileage came out of that?

Talking about wheels, how about the Sun?

How many trillions of living beings have been generated out of a fiery ball in the sky?

Light and Electricity Sustain Life on Earth Solar energy is the primary source and regulator of your body. Down-streaming photons and electrons from the Sun instigate bio-electrical circuits in living organisms. These circuits are the basis of life, whether in the form of plants, birds, elephants, or humans. They start in the internal structure of the atom and amplify in ascending degrees of complexity at the cellular, tissue, and organism levels. The interplay of photons and electrons sustains all health and immunity from disease.

Biophotons A net negative charge runs current through the circuits. All parts of the body, from large to small, are constantly pulsing, quivering and oscillating in innumerable feedback loops. At the atomic level, orbital shifts correlate with energy flux allowing biomolecules to be produced and perform their vital functions. The photons generated by such flux also act as regulators of complex, biochemical reactions within cells. They stream through functional systems ensuring compatibility and resonance.

When biophotons remain in the correct range, a person is in a state of health. Wherever there is deficiency, their life force grows dim, leading the person to physical decline, senescence, or death. Conversely, whenever there are too many biophoton in the wrong places, it correlates with inflammatory processes and epigenetic damage. The most egregious form of bio-photonic disregulation occurs in cancer.

QED: quantum electrodynamics The problem of cancer can be theoretically stated in terms of quantum electrodynamics: disturbed feedback loops of light and electricity inside biological circuits.

If so, we should be able to theorize solutions to cancer also based on QED.

The dietary protocol discovered by Dr. Johanna Budwig was precisely that. It was a method of treating cancer by bringing more solar energy into the body wherever it was needed. She arrived at this understanding by combining two very basic things: flaxseeds and quark. (Quark is a kind of low fat German cottage cheese.)

Could the solution to cancer be arrived at simply by eating cottage cheese mixed with flaxseed?

Please remember the wheel. A wheel is meant to turn. The same applies to any successful healing protocol. This means: you have to do it right and you need to keep moving until you arrive at your destination. You also have to know in which direction you are trying to go. And you have to understand the principle of balance and the laws of nature.

We will now look at the amazing power of flaxseeds, their use in the anti-cancer Budwig Protocol, along with more recent research into the anticancer properties of flaxseeds. We will consider how the Budwig protocol can be combined with CDS for the remediation of both cancers and cardiovascular disease. Both approaches are of minimal cost and totally non-invasive.

Who was Johanna Budwig?

Johanna Budwig was a brilliant German woman who lived from 1908 until 2003 and held doctoral degrees in both physics and chemistry. She was still working at 94 when she fell down and died from a neck fracture. Patients who followed her guidelines experienced remission rates of well over 90%. These patients, moreover, were generally patients with advanced stages of metastatic cancer. Budwig was nominated at least seven times for the Nobel Prize. But it was a man’s world and she was not politically connected. Besides, her discoveries were in conflict with the food industry. Today, her amazing results are mostly ignored or gaslit. She refused to sell out to smooth talking medical grifters in suits sent from the US to sniff out a deal. For this offense, official medical history has buried her. This brilliant woman became an irrelevant footnote, a person who should probably never have been born.

Good Fats and Bad Fats Budwig recognized that processed and industrialized fats are extremely deleterious to health. Today this has become common knowledge: transfatty acids are inflammatory and carcinogenic. But Budwig realized it before anyone else did. She joined the dots between highly processed fats and glycolysis. Transfatty acids block cellular respiration, effectively making cells feel as if they are suffocating. The traumatized cells, in a desperate attempt to survive, pivot from oxygen dependent mitochondrial energy production to glycolysis. Glycolysis is the usage of glucose as fuel and glycolysis fuels the growth and proliferation of cancer cells.

When Budwig began her research, Otto Warburg had recently discovered the mechanisms by which cancer utilizes glycolysis and fermentation even in the presence of oxygen. I covered this topic in my previous post on CDS and cancer. Budwig believed ingestion of poor quality fats was a major factor in carcinogenesis. If bad fats caused disease, then good fats should reverse disease. Where then was the best form of fat? Budwig considered it to be flaxseed oil. As a chemist, Budwig could analyze its biochemical properties. But as a physicist, she could also comprehend its energetic properties: she saw the glowing sun encased in the seed.

The oil in the seed stores the original solar energy streaming from the sun in a very concentrated and compact form. But for this solar energy to become bioavailable to the body, the fat must combine with a protein: that protein, Budwig discovered, was a sulfhydryl found in quark. The fusion of these two ingredients allowed energetic information from the sun to stream into the terrain where cancer was growing. The fully blended mixture of fat and protein also made the oil hydrophilic. This allowed it to permeate better through cell membranes.

The psyche of the cancer cell is totally misunderstood As I have explained in my previous post, cancer cells resort to anerobic metabolism, acid export and metastasis as a desperate survival imperative. When denatured fats from poor diet gag cellular respiration the shocked cells rebel against the rest of the body which they think has turned against them. They become “malignant” meaning that they are now operating against, not with, the protective homeostatic dynamics of the body. They disrupt and they invade. And they generate a lot of acidic waste mostly in the form of lactate. Yet cancer cells are not really attempting to kill the body in which they live. Their primary objective is to survive.

Their behavior is simply a desperate will to survive suffocation.

Cancer cells should be understood as equipped with the potential to become a superorganism, like ants or termites. They diversify and coordinate their responses in both their immediate and distal environments. Angiogenesis in the microenvironment stimulated by cancer cells provides them with supply chains for growth, tumor formation, and ultimately, metastasis. Constant energy supply through new blood vessels brings in glucose and glutamine and is further supported by histamine secreted by mast cells. Cancer cells migrate through the ECM (extra cellular matrix) and conquer new territory. This is called metastasis, which accounts for 90% of all deaths from cancer.

An acidic environment is an electrically deprived environment. In hypoxic, acidic conditions, the mitochondria, which are the powerhouses driving healthy cellular respiration, become run down and deformed. No mitochondrial function, no lasting source of energy, no healthy immune function.

Yet we must not fail to understand all this at the deeper level. The collapse of mitochondrial energy induced by the cancer environment originates in the psychological trauma experienced by the cell which is experiencing suffocation.

This draws out a response from deep within that cell which says:

“I shall survive and I shall multiply.”

The rebellious cell guards its alkalinity deep within its core whilst exporting acids to attack and overwhelm the neighboring environment. But the fact that cancer is at war with you does not mean that you need to be at war with it. Such a war is not necessarily tipped in your favor as results demonstrate. By contrast, impressive cure rates are seen in CDS treatments for cancer, and from patients under the care and guidance of Dr. Budwig and her deep understanding of flaxseeds.

Allopathic theories of cancer, including the metabolic method, fail to acknowledge the psycho-phenomenology of cancer cells because they view the body as a machine.

But the body is not a machine. It is a field of light and light originates from the Sun. Light sustains all life. Johanna Budwig grasped this core reality as a physicist. Her understanding led her to the highest level of remission rates amongst those who sought her help. And for all this, she has been mostly forgotten. Or rather, conveniently side-lined.

I am trying to make this point very clearly because the overwhelming majority of doctors fail to understand the innate survival strategy driving cancer cell activity. As a result, they unconsciously introduce fear and tension, making the patient view their cancer as an enemy rather than as a confused, rebellious part of their own body. This thinking has solidified into ideological perspective. Declare war on cancer! Not only chemotherapy and radiation but even metabolic methods aim to starve cancer cells through ketogenesis rather than eliminate them by delivering more light, energy and charge to unaffected cells.

By contrast, with CDS and the Budwig Protocol photonic and electrical stimulation are the basis of treatment. These two methods adjust biochemical pathways but also, and most importantly, enhance biophysical signals involving relays of solar electrons and photons. CDS and the Budwig diet can be combined to even greater effect.

Recent Studies on the Anticancer effects of Flaxseed When cancer cells migrate and metastasize, they need to undergo morphological changes. They change their shapes in order to slip through gaps, grasp on to the rigging of the extra-cellular matrix, or penetrate into new tissue zones. Cancer stem cells have flexible cytoskeletons that enable this progression. This ability to slither and move is often referred to as the metastatic potential (MP) of a cancer initiator cell.

Flaxseed proteins impede shape-shifting stem cells from gaining new ground. This is part of the antimetastatic properties of flaxseed proteins. Flax proteins contain peptides with a wide range of anti-cancer actions.

2S Albumin interacts with ECM proteins (basically this is the rigging surrounding your cells) inhibiting cancer stem cell invasion as explained above.

Flax globulins enhance innate immune function to target cancer cells and modulate hormone receptors towards anti-cancer responses.

Glutamic acid is an amino acid found in flax. In combination with aspartic acid, also found in flax, it induces cancer cell apoptosis. This action is further supported by two other flax amino acids, leucine and isoleucine.

Besides its high protein content and anti-cancer profile, flax also has up to 800 more lignans than any other plant food. Flax lignans are phytoestrogens converted by gut bacteria. The lignans have demonstrated promising effects on cancers by shrinking the size of tumors, especially hormone sensitive tumors. This shows that the phytoestrogens in flax do not promote tumor growth they inhibit it. The efficacy of flax in shrinking hormone receptive tumors has been particularly noted in three key areas:

breast

prostate

endometrium

Flax is endowed with high levels of omega 3. The most significant of these is ALA (α-linolenic acid). ALA can be metabolized in the body into docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The health benefits of ALA, EPA and DHA have been widely reported for several conditions including:

cancer

cardiovascular disease

hypertension

atherosclerosis

diabetes, cancer

arthritis

osteoporosis

autoimmune and neurological disorders

In short, the essential fatty acid profile found in flaxseeds is highly protective in today’s hostile environment driven by globalist depopulation agendas. Specifically, flaxseed protects your:

heart

arteries

nervous system

immune system

Flaxseed is by far the highest plant source of ALA.

Alpha linolenic acid is:

antioxidant

anti-inflammatory

anti-angiogenic (prevents cancer cells from inducing new blood vessels to grow as supply lines)

In addition to the oils, lignans and proteins, flax seed is plentiful in fiber making it an excellent food source for gut health, improving intestinal motility and elimination. Besides cancer and heart disease, the combination of fibers, lignans and ω-3 fatty acids present in flaxseed have a protective effect against diabetes. We know how widespread diabetes is today, how impaired sugar metabolism feeds the growth of cancer, and how comorbidities such as diabetes have contributed to jab related injury and death. Another dangerous comorbidity is cardiovascular disease and dyslipidemia. The effects of flaxseed and its bioactive components have been studied on postmenopausal women and demonstrated marked reductions in cholesterol and plaque including (hypercholesterolemia).

So flaxseed lowers blood cholesterol and blood sugar, improves intestinal transit, regulates hormone receptors against cancer proliferation, and stimulates healthy immune function.

I hope you are beginning to appreciate why you need to have some flaxseed in your kitchen closet. (Actually in your fridge, protected from exposure to UV light would be better.)

How to Prepare the Budwig Protocol the Correct Way Here is a very simple way to understand it: you need to blend together low fat cottage cheese with flaxseed oil. The proportion should be 2:1 (cheese to oil). These two ingredients need to be patiently stirred by hand until no trace of the oil is visible. Then grind up about the same amount of fresh seeds as the oil (about half he quantity of the cottage cheese. Mix in one teaspoon of raw honey. Place this in a bowl and pour the blended cottage cheese-flaxseed oil over it. For best results, consume this twice daily.

The following more complex instructions are extracted from the guidebook provided by the Budwig Center in Spain:

Start with two tablespoons of low-fat milk. Then add three tablespoons of flaxseed oil. Mix either with a whisk or an electric blender.

The resulting mixture should be nice and smooth (an electric blender is preferred as you can be more sure the oil blends well with all the other ingredients).

Now slowly add the low-fat quark or cottage cheese two tablespoons at a time and keep mixing until combined well, putting in a total of 6 level tablespoons of Low-Fat Quark/cottage cheese.

Grind two tablespoons of flaxseeds (between 5-8 seconds) in a coffee grinder and add 1tsp of honey to the ground flaxseeds. Mix, and place in a separate bowl.

Next, pour the quark and flaxseed oil mix on top of the ground flaxseeds. You can add other ingredients like fruit (berries, lemon juice, etc.) or nuts over the seeds (Optional).

NOTE: Ground seeds start to turn rancid after 20 minutes, so you must eat them immediately. Do not grind and store seeds to be used later. The flaxseed oil must be kept cold, so store it in the fridge. Try to purchase directly from a reliable source such as Barlean’s.

Besides the flaxseed - cottage cheese combination, Johanna Budwig also advised adding some fresh ground flax to other meals. Another important component is fermented food and fruit. Whole grains are not prohibited. The Budwig diet differs from strict ketogenic diets favored in metabolic treatment protocols. On the other hand, it does strongly advise eliminating all animal protein, including eggs and dairy (except for quark or low fat cottage cheese) when facing cancer. Dr. Budwig viewed animal protein as inflammatory and potentially carcinogenic. This is another key difference between her approach and keto diets based on high intake of animal protein and animal fats. For Dr. Budwig it was all about intake of quality fats rather than starving the body of glucose as suggested in metabolic therapies. Since not everyone can tolerate a vegetarian diet, I suggest customizing as necessary when working with a trained health professional.

Last but not least, the Budwig Protocol is not only about food. It is also about sunshine, our primary source of solar electrons. Being outside under the open sky with full skin exposure was an essential in Budwig’s treatment plan for cancer.

Of course, in today’s world, with the skies covered over by chemtrails in the Age of The Great Poisoning, what was possible in Budwig’s time is no longer so straightforward. Nevertheless, we simply have to do what we can in the circumstances. Flaxseed, like CDS, offers us all a lifeline.

Both CDS and flaxseed provide light, electricity, enhanced energy and resonance. Things provided freely by the universe for all sovereign individuals to live out their lives in peace.

Here is a very simple and clear short video put on YT by Dr. Lloyd Jenkins, the director of the Budwig Center in Malaga, Spain.

1l05th3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l05th3,The Horse Clementine review,"I would like to add my own review to my favorite thread. I recently purchased The Horse Clementine bag, and these are my initial thoughts. I purchased the Clementine in the coffee shade. It took the bag a little less than 3 weeks to arrive to the US, I bought it on pre-order. 

The leather is beautiful, especially this deep chocolate shade.
In my opinion the thicker strap is more comfortable than thin crossbody straps.
Perfect slouch only when carried on the shorter strap. The bag looks more rectangular when carried on the crossbody strap, which doesn’t bother me personally, I don’t think it takes anything away from the bag.
Very neat stitching.
Extremely roomy for a crossbody bag.
The hardware seems pretty nice to me, but I don’t have experience with higher end bags.
My bag had that slight chemical smell some buyers describe, which aired out within a few days.
The smaller strap had this a slight bend when it arrived, which straightened out after a few days of hanging on a hanger.

I’m in love with this bag! Such a wonderful piece for the price. I’m so excited to take her out! ",3,1748720846.0,handbags,1,1.0,False

1l05siq,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1l05siq/trail_of_pines/,Trail of pines.,"Mornings in Evergreen Ridge State Park were the kind of soft, golden quiet that filled your soul. Park Ranger Ellie Myles loved waking before the sun, sipping her coffee on the ranger station porch while fog curled low over the tree line. The pines swayed gently in the breeze, whispering secrets to one another. Birds chirped. A fox trotted past her station window, tail flicking like a feather.

Her days were spent in blissful solitude. She hiked the trails, repaired wooden signs, guided the occasional tourist, and checked on the resident owl nesting boxes. Sometimes, she brought homemade muffins to old Mr. Dugan, who ran the little nature center by the lake and insisted squirrels were secretly organizing a coup.

It was late September. The air was crisp. The trees had begun their autumnal blush. Ellie was cataloging trail cams that morning, flipping through the memory cards at her desk. Deer. A bear. A family of raccoons acting like drunk teenagers. Normal stuff.

Until one image made her stop.

It was from Trail 9—an old, little-used path that looped up near Whisper Rock. The photo was time-stamped 2:13 a.m. It showed a man standing completely still in the middle of the trail, facing the camera.

But his face was…wrong. Too smooth. Too pale. His eyes were pure black, like holes bored into raw porcelain. His mouth looked like it had been drawn with charcoal—round, gaping, smudged.

Just one photo. The next frame was empty.

Ellie blinked at it for a long time. Then she laughed.

“Must be a Halloween prank,” she murmured, deleting the file. Probably some bored kids with makeup and night vision. This was Colorado, after all. She’d once caught a teenager dressed as a yeti filming a TikTok.

By noon, the sun had burned off the chill. She threw on her patrol vest, clipped her radio to her shoulder, and took off toward Trail 9. Better to check it out.

The forest welcomed her like it always did. Birds sang. The crunch of leaves underfoot was rhythmic, meditative. She hummed as she walked, brushing her fingers along the tall grass beside the trail.

By the time she reached the trail’s loop near Whisper Rock, her mind had already moved on to what soup she might make for dinner.

Then she noticed it.

A smell.

Ellie stopped. It wasn’t a dead animal smell, not exactly. It was wet and rotten, like mildew and spoiled meat had a baby and let it ferment in the sun.

She scanned the trees.

Nothing.

She moved a few more steps—and the woods went quiet.

Like a switch flipped.

No wind. No birds. Even the insects had stopped.

A drop of sweat ran down her temple, despite the breeze.

Her radio crackled.

She jumped. “Jesus,” she muttered, grabbing the mic. “Ranger Ellie. All clear on Trail 9. Just some… funky smells.”

She turned back toward the main trail.

That’s when she saw him.

The man from the photo.

Standing directly in the middle of the path, ten feet in front of her.

Still. Silent.

His skin was milk-white and glossy. No visible pores. His eyes were enormous and black and wet. His mouth was wide open, too wide, a black hole that looked painted on—but dripped.

Her legs locked.

“Sir?” she managed, voice tight.

He didn’t move. Not even a twitch.

Ellie’s hand drifted to her pepper spray. “I’m a ranger. I’m going to ask you to—""

He took one step forward.

It was a twitchy, marionette step. The kind of movement that didn’t look human.

That’s when the smile started.

Not his mouth—his face. It split. From jaw to ear, the skin peeled into a grin like scissors through soft fruit.

Ellie screamed.

She turned and ran, crashing through the underbrush.

The forest screamed with her. Every tree seemed to reach. Every shadow lunged. Her boots thudded against the trail. Her lungs burned.

Behind her, the sound of wet footfalls followed.

Slap. Drag. Slap. Drag.

She hit the ridge, stumbled, rolled down the hill, landed hard in a pile of pine needles, gasping.

Silence.

She lay there for a full minute.

No footfalls. No white man. No mouth that opened wrong.

Just forest again. Normal. Calm.

Was she losing it? A gas leak at the ranger station? A hallucination?

Then she heard the click.

Right next to her.

A camera.

One of her own trail cams.

It clicked again.

Ellie turned her head, trembling.

The white man was inches from her face, crawling on all fours.

Upside down.

His neck twisted backwards, spider-like, mouth dripping onto her cheek.

“SMILE,” he said, in a voice like a dying cassette tape.

Ellie screamed so hard, she felt something release.

And in the deepest shame of her life, she pooped her pants.

Real, absolute terror.

The woods devoured the sound.

Then she blacked out.

—

They found her the next day near Whisper Rock, curled into a ball, eyes wide open and glassy. She didn’t speak. Wouldn’t eat. Her pants were soaked and ruined. One ranger said her fingernails were embedded in her palms.

They chalked it up to trauma.

Bear attack, maybe.

But the trail cam at Whisper Rock?

Was gone.

Just the strap remained, torn and reeking of mildew.

And three days later, a new image appeared on the ranger station computer.

2:13 a.m.

A close-up.

Ellie’s face, screaming.

And just behind her…

The man.

Getting tooth extractions and dentures is a harrowing process that is tied up with so many emotions. For some it’s embarrassing, like some sort of personal failure. For others, it’s exciting to be able to smile again. 

I finally got the courage to get mine done a few days ago. The top picture shows how my smile looked right before. Not pictured are my bottom front teeth what were much worse, and a top molar that broke a week ago. My problems are related to damage to my teeth and bone that happened when I was a kid. (I loosened my teeth by falling into the corner of a table while running around the house like a hyperactive doofus). It wasn’t corrected at the time and years of ignoring the problem,  not having dental insurance, blah blah blah led me here. 

Anyway, besides the cold sores that popped up (get some Abreva if you have ever had cold sores—the trauma of the procedure may bring them up!), I like the look of my immediates. Learning to smile again, slowly.

Talking is a challenge, still— the saliva!!! It never seems to end!! Also the bottom dentures are interfering with my tongue—it can’t rest at the bottom of my mouth. 

Eating? Ugh. I used to love eating. Now it’s just joylessly shoveling cold liquids and semi solids into my face hole so I don’t faint. I know it will get better. I’ve been having premade protein shakes, soups, smoothies, pudding, Apple sauce, and mashed potatoes. I made sure to get a multivitamin to make sure I’m getting enough nutrition, and some probiotics since I e been on antibiotics. I miss coffee so much. My paperwork only said 48 hours for no caffeine, but they verbally said 2 weeks. Sheesh! I miss wine, too. 

I’m here for the process. Thanks again to all who have shared their experiences!

My moka pot worked great yesterday but today the coffee just doesn't brew. It's only about 3 months old and has worked like a charm since I bought it. My previous moka pot lasted 5+ years.

So I changed the gasket, the funnel, double checked the filter holes (no clogs), no clogs in the upper chamber (where coffee comes out), and I made sure the steam hole was working & not covered up.

I did slightly regrind the coffee I used yesterday, which get things moving, albeit alot less coffee got brewed. I'm wondering if the coffee grinder in the grocery store didn't grind it consistently?

If you think that's it, then are there any handheld grinders that work good???

1l05rnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l05rnk/i_found_something_terrifying_on_my_boyfriends/,I found something terrifying on my boyfriend’s Reddit last night.,"Hi Reddit,
I’m not really sure where to post this or even how to explain what I’m feeling right now. 
I’m honestly terrified. 

I feel like I’m living in some kind of nightmare and I don’t know who to talk to.

I’ve been dating this guy, Eli for just about a year now. We met at a comic book convention and I really hit it off. I’ve never had the best luck with relationships with lots of casual stuff, nothing that felt meaningful. But Eli was… different. Charming, funny, incredibly thoughtful. The kind of guy who just gets you.

There was one moment early on that really stuck with me. My dog had gone missing, and I was a complete mess. Eli showed up at my apartment uninvited but it felt comforting, not creepy. He brought me all my favorite things: blue tulips, vanilla flavored coffee, those red box Ghirardelli chocolates I always buy for myself when I’m sad. We just cried together. It felt so intimate, so real. I remember thinking, This is it. This is the person I’m supposed to be with.

Now I can’t stop thinking about how weird it was that he showed up so fast when I hadn’t posted about it or told anyone yet. He just knew. I thought it was so sweet.

But now I don’t know what to think. 

Because last night… I found his Reddit account.

He uses the same username everywhere. I don’t even know what I was looking for just being curious, I guess. He has a ton of karma (like 42k), and I spent a while scrolling through his post history. A lot of it was harmless nerdy stuff, sarcastic comments, some arguments on r/movies. 

Typical Eli.

But then I found a post from two years ago.

It was on r/offmychest. The title was something like

“I’ve been following a woman home every day. I watch her constantly. I feel like we’re destined to be together.”

I swear to God my heart stopped.

I clicked on it my hands were literally shaking and as I read, everything just… clicked. The way he described her. Where she lived. What she wore. Her job. Her apartment building. Her dog. It was me.
It was definitely me.

In the comments he talked about how he was planning to “bump into” her organically. He said he knew what kind of flowers to get. Someone mentioned how emotional vulnerability can be a way to build intimacy. He replied saying, 

“Tragedy brings people closer.”

And that’s when I thought about my dog.

My dog went missing under the weirdest circumstances. No broken gate, no signs of digging, nothing stolen, just… gone. And I remember thinking it was strange that he’d never wandered off before, not even once in five years.
Eli helped me search for him for hours that day. I cried, he held me, and he said

“Maybe this is the universe pulling us closer together.”

And now I can’t stop thinking that Eli did something to him. That it wasn’t an accident. That he made it happen just so he could be there for me.

He’s at work right now. I’m just sitting here in the apartment we share, staring at my laptop and feeling like I’m going to throw up. I don’t know what to do. I feel paralyzed. I want to run, but I’m scared. What if he’s watching me right now? What if he finds me?

I don’t even know if this is the right place to post this. I just needed someone to hear me

Wait…I think I found a camera.

Please..What do I do?

Any way to give a little more detail my bf at the time (Sam) she was the one that kind of pushed us to get together, anyway they ended up moving out 5 months later with no notice later i find out she was worried about me and Steve when there was nothing as i would never be the other woman or put moves on my friends man...off limits period,  when they moved we still talked and hung out until me and Sam broke up me and Jane drifted appart finding out she really disliked the new man i was seeing, we will call him John, about 2 year pass by i get a invite they were getting married after 10 years, i refused to go as the plan was always that id be a bridgesmaid but then dropped me and instead of telling me she sends an invite, i was really upset about that as we did talk on that topic time and time again...but im glad now i didnt.....i havnt seen them in years the next time i hear anything was she was finally pregnant she had a heck of a time, again i never heard anything other seeing fb post on the arrival of their baby. Lets fast forward another 4 years i find out that jane and steve are seperated, at this time not knowing why, ill get to that....so i contiune life and at the end of this relationship with john as it was becoming hard to deal with a alcoholic.i was leaving, thats when i get a fb msg kinda push right out the door and ends the relationship with john. It was Steve asking how i was and invited me over, i didnt have a car at the time and was a few towns over so he picked me up the second i got in his car i looked at him and my heart right away dropped his smile the look he gave me was unlike anything i felt before, so let say after that things moved very quick i ended up moving in with him in the following few months, now this is when i find out what went down for there marrage to fall appart (his side) he tells me she got weight lose surgry got really skinny and started cheating on him even making out with another guy right infront of him.. i thought omg i so sorryyy. But they were trying to work it out but she did again and then left steve for some other guy who she is now married too.anyway when she found about me shit hit the fan, she was telling him no not Cindy!! anyone but her, i actually thought wow really? I thought she would have be happy as she knew me and we always got along and she could trust me with her child but nope i wasnt allowed around thier daughter so everytime she would come id have to leave, after over a year she finally came around and we starting talking  and this is where i got her side, she told me she caught him msging wanting to meet up with other girls which is why she started cheating to begin with BOOM there it is.... anyway everything felt right until it wasnt..about 2 years i just felt sometimes he would have his phone turned or close it if i got too close to see, he has done this the whole time since we got together i knew his password as id sneek watch while he put it in so i did see it, so one night i decided i wanted to see what he was hiding, he also keep phone under him or his pillow, i slowed life the pillow and slowly take his phone my hands were shaking me praying the dogs wouldnt bark to wake him i put password in and there it was he was talking to other girls calling them sexy and beauitful and wanting to meet up. But when it came to that point he would ignore them or make excuses sorry i had my daughter ...i was mad, and i lost it i woke him up , what the heck is this?, he just sat there like a deer in head lights just to say its not what you think and i could see him trying to figure out what to say, i had screen shots , pictures of everything, so we talked and he begged me not to leave he will stop erase everyone i beleved him, but me reading what he said to them crushed me as he was everything to me. One girl even was like wouldnt your g/f be upset your talking like this he goes what g/f?  oh i forgot to chane my fb status where he went and removed me and says to her better? ..and guess what... u guessed it another year later i find more, so over 4 girls and im sure others that declined him. Anyway lets get to todays date,  yet again i find out he was talking to more and adding more friends to his friends list that are only girls, im at my end of my rope in the 5 years i never once talked to another person the way he was, hes begging for me not to go , i love him so much i want to belevie him but history of him doing this and lying about it, so its at the point either let him do it or leave hes trying everything to prove he only wants me, i might take some of the blame as i did bring up early in our realationship that i also like females and maybe we could explore a threesome at a later date when we were in a soild trustful relationship. But clearly that never happend. But for this one he said he was looking for someone for us, when he knew if we both were in agreement when i would be the one to talk and choose, so im just heart broken. I wanted this guy for the rest of my life now i dont know, i cant even cry cause im so angry that he would risk me over just talking, no he has never meet up with anyone but these girls are local so meeting up would be really easy, but i know 100 percent cause he forgets to delete messages and i see his excuses why he cant meet up, and he works 12 hour shifts comes home and stays with me, i work from home so I know when he leaves and its only to work and back. I dont know what to do, my kids love him i love his daughter as my own and his family is great. I dont want to leave but i feel i deserve better and I cant handle this pain., I give this man everything i see him to work make his lunch , coffee get his clothes out and ready, i make every meal, i do everything and still he goes talking like hes looking for someone else and its not me.. i just want to be happy and a man that only wants me...he says he is that man and needs me and doesnt want to live and go on with life without me, so thats where im at now, i cant trust him and love is not enough when he says i love you has me thinking does he even know what love is? Any guy takes on this? He says he will do anything for me to stay Anything...but this is the 4th time and it keep repeating i want off the repeat ...but can i get off this ride with the man i beleive that is my soul mate?

Hi! Welcome to “How to order at Starbucks” now you may think that how you order your drink doesn’t matter but I promise you it does. Especially at the drive thru speaker. Not only does it help the person taking your order input it quickly is also allows the baristas on bar to start prepping/making your drink even before you’re done ordering.

First let’s learn etiquette when ordering at drive thru. You pull up and try to be ready to order. If you don’t know what you want that’s fine but it’s best if you already know what you want as well as what everyone else in your car wants. Especially if you have kids. Nothing boils baristas blood more than someone who racks up our drive thru order time saying “ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm” for 5 minutes. 

We’re a business. We have to keep the line moving. If you need more time with the menu feel free to come inside and stare at the menu for an hour! Or better yet check out our menu online or on our app. Please ask what your passengers want before you pull up because then it allows them to think about what they want as well so we’re not waiting for your 6 kids to pick what kind of cake pop they want and if they want a Frappuccino or a pink drink 😂😂

Next on the etiquette lesson plan is waiting patiently. Especially if there are 20 cars ahead of you and behind you. Even if there isn’t a car in front of you please be patient. Don’t come up to the speaker box and just scream “HELLLOOOOOOOOO???!??!?” 

We know you’re there. Give us a chance to finish whatever task we’re doing whether it’s helping another customer in the cafe (this is especially the case when it’s the evening and we only have 2-3 people on the floor so the same person taking your order at drive thru is also taking all of the orders at register AND doing all of the food orders) or we are handing out drinks and taking payments at the window or stocking something for the baristas on bar. It’s ok, we won’t forget about you! 

Usually we will say “hi we’ll be right with you give us just a second” or something like that. If someone has said that to you then please be patient. It could be 30 seconds or it could be 2 minutes before your order is taken. We are sorry but we are insanely busy at times and we can only spread ourselves so thin. Patience is key. If you aren’t a patient person please don’t join the line when there’s 20 cars wrapped around the building. You will have to wait and we’re sorry about that but there’s nothing we can do. 

Lesson 3 in ordering etiquette is how you speak. Our speakers are crappy and our headsets are even crappier. Please speak loudly and clearly. Stick your head out of the window if you have to. If you have a loud vehicle like a truck or sports car please be courteous and turn it off before ordering. We can not hear you over the roar of your engine! 

Please don’t order from the passenger seat. We cannot hear you speaking across the driver. Tell the driver what you want to order and have them order it. It’s ok if your husband or friend or whoever orders your drink one word at a time. It’s way better than us trying to figure out what you’re screaming from 10 feet away from the box. 

Please don’t mumble or whisper your order. We can not hear you. Enunciate your words and speak clearly. Turn your radio down and tell your kids to stop screaming. If the kiddos just can’t stop or you lost your voice we have an app you can order through as well. Please don’t put a mobile order in as you’re pulling up to the speaker box. Order ahead and save yourself and us the headache!! 

Now to the final lesson of ordering etiquette. HOW you order your drink. Here is the order you should be…well ordering 😂

~

Size
Hot or Iced
Shot modifications (if applicable) 
Base drink name
Syrup modifications
Milk modifications
Topping modifications

Now I will explain why this order is important and then give an example order showcasing all of them. 

Size FIRST- you can say small medium or large. We know what you mean. However if you do want to learn our vernacular then our cup sizes are Short, Tall, Grande, and Venti for hot drinks and Tall, Grande, and Venti for Frappuccinos and iced espresso/lattes. Iced coffee, cold brew, teas, and all of the refreshers can go all the way up to a Trenta. Nitro cold brew is ONLY available in tall and grande sizes. 

Hot or iced- getting your drink hot or iced may seem like it doesn’t matter but it does. Especially drinks like lattes. Hot and iced have different recipes depending on the size. A venti hot vanilla latte has less shots and less syrups than and venti iced vanilla latte. This helps our barista on bar queue the right amount of shots and the right amount of syrups pumps but also tells them whether they will need to steam milk or not. 

Shot modification-this only applies if you’re adding or taking away shots or if you are changing the type of shot. The amount of shots in a hot drink is 1-1-2-2. 1 for short and tall drinks and 2 shots for grande and venti. For iced drinks it’s 1-2-3. 1 for tall, 2 for grande, and 3 for venti. For example if you want a grande hot latte with 3 shots you could say “can I get a grande hot triple shot latte?” Or “can I get a venti iced single shot Carmel macchiato?” This is also when you will tell us if it’s decaf or blonde. “Can I get a Venti iced decaf americano?” 

Base drink name- this tells us what drink recipe we will be following. Like a latte or and iced shaken espresso. We can not ring up your drink until you tell use what the drink is. We will get to your modifications but first we need to know WHAT we’re modifying lol. 

Syrup Modifications- this is important because of how we sequence our drinks. We have to pump the syrups first for majority of the drinks. If a drink has vanilla but you want sugar free vanilla we need to know that asap so the barista doesn’t start making the standard base drink. This is also when you would tell us how many pumps if you’re adding or taking a way. Standard recipe is 2-3-4-5 (short-tall-grande-venti) for hot drinks. And 3-4-6 (tall-grande-venti) for iced. Trenta drinks will gets 7 pumps standardly. “Can I get a venti iced vanilla latte with 4 pumps of vanilla and 3 pumps of cinnamon dolce?” 

Milk modifications- now you’ll tell us if you want a milk alternative or you want to change the kind of milk. Standard recipe for espresso drinks is 2% except for our oat shaken espressos where the standard is you guessed it, oatmilk 😂. And our Frappuccino standard is whole milk. 
Our list of milks are
Nonfat
2% 
Whole
Soy
Almond
Coconut
Oat
Heavy Cream
And Breve (half and half)

If the milk is the only modification you can tell use before the base drink sometimes. “Can I get a venti iced soy vanilla latte?” Or you can just say it with the milk modification. “Cans I get a venti iced vanilla latte with soy milk?” 

Topping/other modifications- this is where you will tell us if you want cold foam or no whip cream or extra caramel crunch or caramel walls etc. as well as any alternative sweeteners like Splenda or stevia etc. Frappuccinos will automatically come with whip cream except for plain coffee Frappuccinos and espresso Frappuccinos. Also we will not take the whip cream off of milk alternative Frappuccinos or other drinks that come with whip unless you specify. So if you get an almond milk mocha Frappuccino you need to tell us if you don’t want whip cream. 

I’m sure there are things I’m missing nd other baristas and chime in the comments of other tips or advice they want customers to know about ordering but this is the basic ordering layout that we have. Of course we’re not going to berate you if you don’t order it this way but we may grumble to each other a little and this is really just so we can streamline the ordering process and get the line moving quickly and our SMs and DMs off our asses about DTO times 💀 

Thanks for coming to my ted talk 🙂‍↕️

TLDR: Ordering tips- speak loud and clear into the speak box. Turn your vehicle off if it has a loud engine and order your drink with the following layout in mind 

Size
Hot or Iced
Shot modifications (if applicable) 
Base drink name
Syrup modifications
Milk modifications

1l05ptx,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1l05ptx/am_i_overreacting_warning_tldr/,Am I overreacting? warning: TL;DR,"For context: my mom and I have ALWAYS had a rocky relationship. She is the most self-centered person I have ever met. When something happens or goes down, her first thought is, “how is this going to affect ME!” In the past, I have gone years without speaking to her but about 6 years ago, my granny was diagnosed with Parkinson’s and my mother moved in with her to help, so to see my granny, I had to see my mother. So we started working on our relationship. 

I know this is crazy, pls don’t blame me, but my mom and I ended up moving in together. It just worked out better financially for the both of us. We have our moments. But, EVERY DAY is a bad day for her, and I mean every. Single. Day. Something is always wrong with her…. She will feel sick, her blood pressure will be high and she’s dizzy, her stomach hurts, her boss was mean to her, she doesn’t want to do her job bc it’s too hard… just some examples of the day to day with her. She will call up her friends just to tell them ab whatever is going on w her that day and how bad she is doing. IMO, all for attention bc she is extremely attention seeking, constantly. 

I was walking yesterday and I thought to myself, “man, she must live such a miserable life bc every single day, somethings wrong and her life is so hard for her.” But honestly, it’s so hard for me to have any sort of compassion towards her. Idk if it’s bc of our past, the trauma she put me thru (she was NOT a good mother to me growing up) or if I just see straight thru her bullshit and don’t feel like feeling sorry for her and giving her what she wants… she wants me to be like, “oh, poor mom, god I am so sorry that ure having such a bad day, that is so terrible, is there anything I can do to turn it around?”

Anyways, this morning she woke up sick…. She said her nose is stopped up and she feels like she might have a cold. And this could all very well be true, she truly may have came down w a cold. But she walks around the house like she’s out of breath and is literally moaning and groaning w every move she makes. It’s ridiculous to me!!! 

Well I had to run an errand and today I took my puppy which is a 1 year old dachshund for context. I went to grab a coffee and pick up a medication from our vet. She called me while I was out and asked me to stop and get some diet cokes for her at the gas station by our house. I told her that they do not allow pets in the store whatsoever bc I’ve tried before. She said, “you may have to just leave Ruby (my puppy) in the car running while u go in.” We live in a really rough part of time. There’s tons of homeless people who hang around the gas station, drug dealers etc. and she wants me to leave my dachshund in the car, unlocked, at an extremely busy gas station bc she NEEDS her diet cokes!! (She’s addicted to diet cokes). Of course I told her that I’m not going to do that. I’m not going to risk my dog being stollen over a Diet Coke…. And of course she was upset with me bc she doesn’t feel good and doesn’t feel like leaving the house. 

It BLOWS my mind that she would even ask that or suggest that. Wait, actually, no it doesn’t. Bc she’s so selfish and she’s always only concerned ab her wants and needs. 

If she knew and saw she was running low on diet cokes, she should’ve ran to the store yesterday! She literally waits for me to leave the house to have me pick things up for her. Every time. 

If I try to talk to her ab this and express my feelings and how she made me upset to ask me to leave my dog in the car unlocked in a rough part of town, she will get so angry and mad at me. She will guilt trip me and hold things over my head. “I’ve done all this for u in the past and this is how u treat me!” - is what she’ll say. So I don’t even bother to talk to her about it bc I just don’t want to hear it!!!

Just now, she came in and asked me what was wrong and said I’ve been quiet all day… 

I guess I just want to know if I’m over reacting or crazy to be this upset over something so minor. Maybe it’s an accumulation of her actions over the past 2 weeks, idk.

By Me—Whatever That Means

\[Entry 1: Monday, January 5th\]

I’ve made 63 versions of myself in the last twelve years.

Some were better than others. Mason Weller was charming. I miss him sometimes. He had friends. He had a dog. He was almost real. Then he got too close to someone. She started noticing things. The scar on his shoulder moved. The smell of his skin changed. She cried when I left. I think I did, too.

I try not to think about her.

Today I am Nathan. Nathan Carpenter. Age twenty-seven. Height: 5'11"". Brown eyes, black hair, slight cleft in my chin (added for character), and a nervous habit of adjusting my collar. I work in IT. I drink black coffee. I like Radiohead. That’s what Nathan likes. And I like Nathan. I think.

First day at the new job. They gave me a lanyard with my name on it, as if pinning my identity to my chest might make it more real. It doesn’t. But I smile, say the lines I’ve rehearsed a hundred times in the mirror. The jokes land, more or less. Someone laughs.

I should feel like a success.

I don’t.

\[Entry 2: Wednesday, January 7th\]

I changed my hair this morning. No one noticed. Of course, I only changed the texture, a little tighter curl, more volume. Maybe Nathan uses mousse now. Maybe he’s going through a phase. People accept small changes. It’s the big ones that make them ask questions.

I wonder how far I could go before they stop recognizing me. Would they still invite me to lunch if I made my eyes green instead of brown? Would they still laugh at my jokes if I had a southern drawl?

Most people spend their lives trying to be noticed. I spend mine hoping I won't be noticed too much.

\[Entry 3: Friday, January 9th\]

It’s exhausting, pretending to be someone I’m not.

But the truth is—there is no real me. I’m not a werewolf or a superhero. I’m a shapeshifter. I don’t have a true form, not even in the mirror. I’m just... potential. Skin and memory, waiting to be used.

People think that sounds cool.

It’s not.

You wake up every day not knowing who you are. You pick a mask and hope it fits. You hope it doesn’t itch too much or slip off when someone hugs you too tight.

Sometimes, I think I was born to be forgotten.

\[Entry 4: Saturday, January 10th\]

Wandered around the park today. I used to like walking through parks in my other lives. People always look at nature as some sort of anchor, as if trees and grass and sunlight have answers.

I sat near the duck pond for an hour, just watching. No one paid me any mind. That’s the strange benefit of this life. I can be invisible without being absent. There’s a comfort in the quiet.

A boy ran past me, laughing. His mother followed, breathless but smiling. I wondered what it would be like to have someone chase me—not because I’m running, but because they care.

\[Entry 5: Sunday, January 11th\]

Had coffee with a coworker today. Jill. She likes horror movies and owns four cactuses. Cacti. She corrected me with a grin. I laughed, genuinely. That surprised me.

She said, ""You're kind of weird, Nathan. But in a good way.""

I smiled. My skin held. My voice didn't crack. But inside, something shifted.

Weird. That word used to make me flinch. Now it feels like a compliment. Maybe because it’s true. Maybe because it means she sees something real, even if I don’t.

\[Entry 6: Monday, January 12th\]

I caught myself humming while refilling my coffee. It wasn’t even on purpose. A tune just bubbled out of me. I don’t even remember what song it was. Jill smiled at me over the breakroom table.

""You're more relaxed than last week,"" she said.

I shrugged. I wanted to say, ""Maybe I’m learning how to breathe.""

Instead I just nodded and stirred in too much sugar.

\[Entry 7: Tuesday, January 13th\]

I almost changed this morning.

I found a wrinkle forming at the corner of my eye. Nathan doesn’t have wrinkles. He’s 27. He jogs. He moisturizes. But for a moment, I looked at that wrinkle and thought, maybe I should be someone new. Someone fresher. Someone with smoother skin and fewer regrets.

But I didn’t. I went to work with the wrinkle.

Jill said it made me look thoughtful.

I think that means something.

\[Entry 8: Thursday, January 15th\]

They invited me to trivia night. Me. Not a version of me. Not an avatar. Just Nathan. The guy with too many pens in his desk drawer and a drawer full of unfiled bug reports.

I went. I knew all the answers in the ""Obscure Mythology"" round. I held back, let others shine. Jill gave me a look—half amusement, half curiosity.

""You're full of surprises,"" she said.

I wanted to tell her everything. I wanted to say, ""I’m not who you think I am. I don’t even know who I am.""

But I didn’t.

Because part of me wonders—does it matter?

\[Entry 9: Friday, January 16th\]

It’s strange. The more time I spend as Nathan, the more he starts to feel... stable. I’ve never stuck with one identity this long in years. Not since Mason.

Maybe it’s Jill. Maybe it’s the office. Maybe it’s just that I’m tired of running.

I don’t want to jinx it. But I feel... tethered.

\[Entry 10: Saturday, January 17th\]

I stood in front of the mirror today for an hour, shifting.

Skinny. Muscular. Pale. Freckled. Tall. Female. Bald. Child. Elderly. Black. White. Redhead. Scarred. Laughing. Crying. Screaming.

I went through every version of myself I could remember. Every identity I wore like a jacket I never quite tailored to fit. And then I stopped.

I went back to Nathan.

Not because he's perfect. But because he's something. And something, even if borrowed, feels better than nothing.

\[Entry 11: Monday, January 19th\]

Jill asked me to go on a weekend trip with the group. Hiking and a cabin and games and s'mores.

This is how it always begins—the intimacy that precedes suspicion.

But I said yes.

And I meant it.

\[Entry 12: Thursday, January 22nd\]

Packing for the trip. I’ve got my borrowed camping gear, a borrowed sleeping bag, borrowed expectations. I’ve always envied people who can do these things without self-consciousness. Who can plan and participate and believe that the world wants them around.

Maybe Nathan is that kind of person.

\[Entry 13: Friday, January 23rd\]

We’re driving up into the mountains. Jill is in the passenger seat, singing off-key. The others are in the back, laughing at some inside joke I only half understand. My face hurts from smiling.

For a moment, I forget I’m pretending.

For a moment, I am just... here.

\[Entry 14: Saturday, January 24th\]

I stayed up late talking with Jill. She told me stories from her childhood—getting lost in a supermarket, a pet turtle named Comet, her first kiss behind the gym.

I told her about... some of mine. Real ones. Or at least ones that felt real. The time ""I"" broke my arm skateboarding. The time ""my"" mom made pancakes shaped like dinosaurs.

I think I made her laugh.

\[Entry 15: Sunday, January 25th\]

The firelight made everyone look like ghosts.

Jill sat close. Too close. She reached out and touched my face.

""You ever feel like you’re not really who people think you are?"" she asked.

I swallowed.

""All the time,"" I said.

She nodded.

""That’s okay. Everyone’s faking it. Just some are better at it than others.""

I laughed. She did, too. Then she leaned in.

I didn’t change. Not even a little.

\[Entry 16: Tuesday, January 27th\]

The others posted pictures from the trip. I’m in them. Laughing, arms around people, smiling in ways I didn’t stage. Jill tagged me. Friends of friends added me. People commented things like “Looks fun!” and “Great crew!”

I’ve never been part of a crew.

Not until now.

\[Entry 17: Wednesday, January 28th\]

I woke up today and didn’t hate the reflection. I even whistled in the shower. Nathan whistles now.

\[Entry 18: Friday, January 30th\]

Jill told me she had a nightmare where I disappeared. Just... turned into someone else.

I froze.

She said she was scared she wouldn’t recognize me if that ever happened. That maybe I’d already changed.

I told her, ""No matter how I look, the part of me that laughs at your bad puns? That’s me. That’s the real part.""

She said, ""Then I think I know you better than you think.""

\[Entry 19: Thursday, February 5th\]

I’ve been thinking about telling her. The truth. The whole truth.

It terrifies me.

But more than that—it feels like something I owe. To her. To myself.

I don’t want to keep hiding behind skin and hair and a name that I borrowed from an old neighbor.

\[Final Entry: Friday, February 6th\]

I told Jill everything.

I thought she’d laugh. Or scream. Or tell me to get help.

She didn’t. She looked at me for a long time, then said, ""You’re still you. And I still like you.""

And then she hugged me. Tight.

I cried. Not shapeshifter tears. Not actor’s tears. Real ones.

I don’t know what comes next. But for the first time in a long time, I want to find out.

Not as someone new.

But as me.

Whoever that is.

We both live with our parents but my parents are currently on vacation, so he decided to spend the weekend with me. Originally, he was going to stay over from wednesday until tomorrow, but he had to work yesterday and today.

Yesterday I went to see my friend who lives in the next town over. I went there with my parents' car.

This afternoon, I went to have coffee and lunch with my cousin. I hadn't seen her in a while, so we thought it might be fun to have lunch together. My boyfriend picked me up near the city center and drove us both to my home. When he saw the car he asked why I moved it so I told him I had lunch with my cousin.

He asked ""But secretly you were seeing your side piece?"" I was so dumbfounded by that question that I just stared at him. He doubled down and went ""So you were with someone else?""

I got really upset and got out of the car. He called after me that it was just a joke and that he really didn't mean it. He said he assumed I'd know it was a joke.

When we got inside he hugged me and apologized for it multiple times. Eventually I calmed down, but him asking that just keeps replaying in my head. I keep wondering if something actually made him think that I would cheat.",2,1748720132.0,AmIOverreacting,5,1.0,False

Now for the good stuff. I play on xbox and PlayStation. I enjoy singleplayer games but I do enjoy goofing off with friends in co-op games like helldivers. I'm always down to game but I will not play fortnite or CoD. 

More good stuff. I love food and cooking. I'm what the kids call a fatass. I don't think I have a favorite thing to make but as for eating I do enjoy a nice bacon cheeseburger. I do make a mean bowl of fruity pebbles. And I have a tendency to make waffles with ice coffee. 

I love music. Rock and metal. When I wanna get wild I whip out the Macarena or Barbie girl. 

I wish I had the ability to focus on reading. I miss it but I blame phones for making my ability to concentrate not exist. But I do have books I want to read. 

I'm down for swapping selfies and moving onto other platforms if things are cool.

How do I combat loneliness in my relationship?,"I (29f) have been with my partner (32m) for 10 months now. He is very loving and caring, but I feel isolated from my old friends and family. 

He is very much surrounded by an amazing group of friends and family who are always so connected with him. He is able to fully enjoy his life outside of our relationship it seems, but outside of our relationship I have nothing. I don’t have a family to speak with often, my friends have become too busy in their own lives or have found new friends who they would rather spend their time with, and although I really tried to keep these connections, I find myself ignored by everyone I reach out to.

In my current relationship, he prefers to keep his friends and me separate, and I am not to be part of his friend group, so this type of socialising is out of the question. In my previous relationship, I became very quickly part of my ex’s friend group to the point where I could hang out with them without my ex even being there.

Despite trying hard and not wanting to lose the people I once was close to, I don’t know what else to do to try and gain a social circle again. 

I have developed such anxiety around doing anything where I am to meet new people, so I end up doing everything on my own if I’m not with my boyfriend. It’s the worst feeling, and as much as I feel speaking with a therapist may help me come to an idea of how to become more confident in making friends again as an adult, I just don’t have the funds for this option. 

Instead, I sit at home and watch movies on my own, or I go for coffee with a book on my own, but this is the extent of my hobbies. I miss my old life, and I miss people.

Clio, Michigan transformed from a farming outpost to an industrial hub in the early 20th century, marked by a vital railroad, local trade, and evolving community institutions, reflecting its enduring spirit and history. \
Clio, Michigan — once a small farming outpost along the Pere Marquette line — evolved into a hub of industry and commerce during the early 20th century. The images that survive from the 1890s through the 1940s tell the story of that transition.\
\
Video\
\
\
\
Railroads Shaped Early Clio Michigan\
\
\
\
The Pere Marquette Railroad Depot was Clio’s gateway to the wider world. Farmers shipped crops. Merchants unloaded crates. Families waited for letters or to visit relatives. The depot was long, plain, and functional, but it brought life to the town.\
\
Trains connected Clio to Flint, Saginaw, and beyond. Daily schedules were posted in the general store, and locals could time their errands by the sound of the whistle. For many residents, the depot was the first thing they saw when they came to town, and often the last before they left.\
\
The depot was also where newspapers and national magazines arrived. Local businesses advertised in regional circulars, and itinerant salesmen would hop off to peddle their goods. This flow of people and ideas helped transform Clio from a farming settlement into a trading center.\
\
Local Trade and Labor\
\
\
\
One of the most revealing photos shows a blacksmith standing in front of a small, rugged workshop. The hand-painted signs suggest tobacco sales, a common sideline for tradesmen. In early Clio Michigan, a shop wasn’t just for one job. It was a little bit of everything — forge, counter, and social hub.\
\
\
\
Nearby, the L.A. Wright lumber yard and sash company did brisk business. Stacks of milled wood filled the yard, ready for homes, barns, and storefronts across Genesee County. These photos capture an industrial rhythm — sawdust on the ground, railcars lined up, men in overcoats and fedoras.\
\
Jobs were often seasonal. Men who worked the yards in summer might shovel coal for the railroad or help with snow removal in winter. Children contributed too, delivering goods or helping sort scrap lumber.\
\
Clio Michigan Main Street Commerce\
\
\
\
Vienna and Main streets are featured in several postcards. Brick buildings and wooden facades lined the roads. Businesses included Schofield & Meeks Dry Goods, Giberson’s Big Store, and a number of local banks. Ice cream shops and cafes came later, reflecting new tastes as automobiles changed the pace of daily life.\
\
Clio’s commercial strip grew in tandem with regional development. Nearby Flint’s rapid expansion during the rise of the auto industry meant that small towns like Clio gained access to new markets. Storefronts updated their signage. Tailors, barbers, grocers, and dry goods sellers found new customers in rail workers, teachers, and traveling salesmen.\
\
Electric streetlights and telephone poles began to appear, adding a sense of modernity. Clio’s post office became a vital artery of communication. When mail arrived on the train, it was sorted and walked through muddy or snow-packed streets to be delivered by hand.\
\
\
\
You can see the shift in the photographs. In one image, horse-drawn wagons wait beside storefronts. In another, rows of Model Ts and streetlamps dominate the scene.\
\
Institutions and Community\
\
\
\
Clio’s public institutions also played a central role. The First Methodist Episcopal Church, built of brick with detailed stained-glass windows, was more than a spiritual center. It anchored the town socially and architecturally.\
\
Church picnics and revival meetings were major community events. Bells from the tower could be heard for blocks, calling residents to Sunday service or civic gatherings.\
\
\
\
The Masonic Temple, dedicated in 1915, shows Clio’s civic ambition. The two-story building also served as an auditorium. Events, speeches, and ceremonies made it a vital part of public life.\
\
By the 1930s, fraternal groups like the Masons, Odd Fellows, and Women’s Relief Corps provided structure for charitable work, social aid, and youth mentorship. These groups reinforced values of self-reliance, order, and mutual support — principles that defined the era.\
\
The Rise of the Automobile in Clio Michigan\
\
\
\
Clio didn’t explode into a metropolis. But it didn't stay a dusty railroad town either. Instead, it gradually adopted electric streetlights, paved roads, and corner gas stations. In one photo from the 1930s, a DX service station sits beside a Chevrolet dealership. Behind it, the church’s steeple still rises — a reminder of what came before.\
\
Gas stations like Bauer Brothers filled more than their tanks. They offered road maps, mechanic work, and sometimes a cup of coffee. With cars, families in Clio could drive to Flint for factory work or weekend shopping. But they still returned home to Clio’s quieter streets.\
\
\
\
As automobiles replaced horses, storefronts shifted. Hitching posts were removed. Cafés added parking spaces. Ice cream parlors and soda fountains emerged as popular hangouts for teenagers. By 1940, Clio’s Main Street had become a mix of old habits and new expectations.\
\
The Enduring Face of Clio\
\
\
\
Today, many of the buildings shown in these images are gone or changed. But the structure of Clio — its layout, its spirit — remains. The echoes of its early days still shape the town.\

1l058d8,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1l058d8/dating_is_confusing_maybe_i_am_overthinking_is/,"Dating is confusing, maybe I am overthinking? Is either guy for real?","It’s a long story but not much happens…..

I (28F) met a guy(30M) on a dating app, almost 2 years ago. At that time, we matched, got phone numbers, texted and talked on the phone. Felt magical in a very fun way. Same type of job, live in same area, hobbies, etc. 

This was around the winter holidays,so it took a while to set up the first date but eventually we did after New Year’s. It was a very fun date, just felt very easy and again because we had a lot in common we had a lot to chat about. The date last about 4 hours, dinner, walked around the area, dessert. 

Fast forward, he kept texting me but didn’t set up date 2 yet so I mentioned to him, something like “I had a lovely time, would love to do that again.” He said “Yes I had a great time as well, we should!” (Paraphrasing since I was a while ago)

I figured he wasn’t serious because he kept only texting but no real plans. I gave up, dated other people. 

Then he comes back sets up another date, it goes well and again. So after 4th date, he asks to be his girlfriend and exclusive. I said “yes that would be nice however let’s plan to meet more often” and he said “of course!” 

Now maybe I did say “yes too soon” but figured if I didn’t agree with his dating style then I would communicate that with him. I really did enjoy my time with him in person and could see compatibility and chemistry there. 

Then crickets from him regarding seeing me in person. He did call and text the next two weeks and said something came up in the family. I told him again “I apologize and all but to be exclusive I really need more communication from him. Let’s set up a date when his family stuff settles down.” 

He agreed. Crickets all summer in terms of in person dates, only sending me random pics of his day. 

In the meantime my family introduced me to someone else. He is very kind and very consistent with in person dates. We have been dating since so about a year only didn’t see each other when we only vacations, separately. However, due to his busy schedule and living about 2 hours from me, he can’t see me more than once a week , most weeks. He met my family recently but he again is very introverted and shy. So I am not sure how my parents got along with him. (My family is chatty). He is mid-30’s so I expected him to talk more about future plans/marriage by now. Is that expecting too much?

The first guy texts me, on and off, mainly about our field of work. I told him, “what does he want?” He said well to be more than friends?” I told him I am dating someone else and he said “well so were we?” Quite honestly, confused me. He told me “he was serious about me but had a family thing that happened?” But I mean all summer? Really? Over a year ago now that it’s almost summer again. He said “well you were also busy end of summer” then basically gets mad at me because I am difficult to plan with. I don’t really know what he wants now because he will do that then ghost for a week or two. 

Am I being dragged around by both of them? What should I expect? I really want a loyal relationship that can lead to a marriage. I don’t ask for anything fancy, simple dates, like coffee or simple lunch/dinners, hikes or movies… that kind of stuff. I was clarity but don’t want to sound too pushy if I am expecting too much too soon. 

I was hurt in the past in my early 20’s so I can get a little cautious too. 

Please ask questions if needed. 

Thank you for reading it all. This dating scene slightly terrifies me and I don’t know if I am reading anyone’s intention correctly.

1l0549c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cirrhosis/comments/1l0549c/coffee_grounds_my_story/,Coffee Grounds - my story,"It’s funny I had never heard of them used in the context of medical emergency before but that was my call to go to the hospital.

April 2024 I was feeling a little “off” first few days of April, I suddenly lost any desire to go hang out with friends at the bar so stayed home drinking on an evening. 

Over that week things got weird, I couldn’t shit to save my life, 3 nights passed, god knows how many laxatives I’d taken (if only I’d known lactulose was in my near future) and then one morning I got a severe urge to vomit. Cue racing to the toilet and vomiting violently for what felt like forever.

I looked down and all I saw was coffee grounds, a fuck ton of coffee grounds. When I looked up in the mirror, a Simpson character was staring back at me. Blind panic drove to El Camino hospital where the ER doctor very quickly assessed I was in the midst of liver failure.

Quick procedure to look for varies in my throat confirmed the cause of said grounds and I woke up in ICU. Couple days later after only being told I had hepatorenal syndrome I was moved to a room. I kind of felt ok primarily because of the meds and painkillers no doubt before a doctor walked in and gave me the bad news….”you have ELSD and it’s bad, very bad”

A day later while surrounded by my sister, my ex and my 9 year old daughter a team consisting of a few doctors and a social worker walked in. The main doctor suggested my daughter leave the room before telling me at this stage you will be dead within two months and we suggest moving you to hospice care.

Goddamn. I was just shook. 2 months? I’m 36? Wtf.

Fortunately for me Stanford took up my case and I was promptly shipped over there for a transplant screening. After a bunch of tests many of you will be familiar with they believed they could get me strong enough for surgery but questions were raised about post op support.

I didn’t really have anyone who I could live with or who could provide full time care. My family lives overseas (my sister had flown over when I was initially taken in)

It was at that point the side effects really kicked in. Weight loss was rapid, ascites required weekly drains, lost all strength and did my business in diapers.

Stanford did a great job medication wise and I felt ok (side effects, pain and mobility aside) I kept getting a delayed decision time and again as I just laid there, it was always either a question of my commitment post surgery to care for myself or circle of support.

I began getting more and more frustrated and became a bit of a pain in the ass patient and it all came to a head at the end of September when the doctor group came to my room and told me they had their meeting and at this time they weren’t going to list me. 

I said ok when is the next circle back date? It was at this point they said this is their final decision, no more pushbacks, just it’s over.

I should probably add here I had lost my house recently so had no actual place to stay post hospital, I had no income as I had left my job a month before coffee ground gate.

Through tearful eyes I just remember saying “so you’re just going to throw me out on to the streets to die?”

A few days later I was moved to a rehab facility with bloods still being collected weekly and a monthly check in with my hepatologist.

I was doing pretty well at the facility, got on with the nurses, the residents all had good stories and I was youngest by easily 30 years.

At that point it felt like my disease wasn’t really progressing too badly, levels were askew across the board but stable. PT got me walking again and I genuinely felt drug fueled ok.

Then a few weeks later I had my recent bloods and went to my monthly meeting at Stamford and within a second of her reviewing my levels she stood up and said we need to get you into the hospital now and proceeded to tell me a sentence I’ll never forget. “You are actively dying and you’ve got about 2 weeks”

So back to Stamford, back to the machines, back to the daily visits of doctor teams etc

I was fading fast and had made peace with my ending, wasn’t when I wanted it or how I wanted it but it was what it was. I had a few tests run on my heart and they decided to make one last run at getting me on the list.

To my surprise I was approved and added. I wasn’t that joyful though because I was so sick,  all my bleeding levels were way too high for surgeons comfort and where was I going to find a liver in a few days notice and lord knows where I am on the list.

My MELD was in the 30s and even though it was nice to be on the list I didn’t think I had time or the strength for surgery.

A couple days later I was so ill every time I closed my eyes sleepily I thought this was it. That same day around dinner time I was told they had secured a liver for me and surgery would be in the morning provided surgeons signed off on it.

Cue a rush of drugs after drug followed by blood test after blood test to get within surgeons limit which we eventually did.

The day of surgery I was woken and rolled down to surgery, I don’t remember much of what was said and barely remember getting anesthesia.

I woke up several days later. Sad trust was I’d had woken a few days earlier but my encephalitis was off the charts and I was delirious and I have no memory of those days.

All I know is I woke up with hands and feet strapped to my bed. So I must’ve been fun.

A few days later I was taken from ICU to Gen Pop where I actually learned about my surgery, how I had basically bled out and had a heart attack not once but twice and flat lines both times. I was then told by a neurosurgeon that the damage to my brain would likely be permanent. Apparently being denied oxygen while flooded with ammonia isn’t a recipe for success for the brain.

Rehab in the hospital was extremely slow, I was so ill before surgery and what had happened during surgery meant it was painful to do anything let alone contemplate walking or sitting in the chair. 

After a couple of months I was transferred to a rehab facility and over 6 weeks my transformation was insane, eating every minute, walking, dressing, showering, toileting (god I missed you) like a normal person and I was released into the real gen pop.

My life is still a bit up in the air atm and I’m using SDI to pay for a long term rental but I am alive somehow, I don’t know how, but some how.

I was 82lbs after surgery, 6 months later I am 168lbs so I no longer resemble a stick figure. I have a lot of meds to take to handle the liver and my brain as I suffer from post transplant encephalopathy as well as PTSD.

Meds:

Prograf
Cell cept 
Megace
Duloxemine
Gabapentin
Drizalma
Clozapine
Gangclivor 
Atarax
Bactrim
Baclofen
Metoprolol
Rifampin
Magnesium
Multi vit 
Thiamine

The purpose of this was to get it off my chest and also to offer some hope that I was nearly dead when I was diagnosed and even did die twice and I’m still here looking forward to the future. You can fight this bastard of a disease too, just believe in the warrior you are!

And a final note for any of you diagnosed due to alcohol, I refused to accept this diagnosis, I thought it was lazy simply because I was obese, hadn’t done hard drugs heavily or have hep b but did drink it seemed like an autofill.

Yet when I got the post op diagnosis of my old liver it was classified on my medical records as “cryptogenic cirrhosis” which ultimately meant having run every test they could they couldn’t actually find out what caused it. So glad I did all those Aa meetings to get listed because obviously I did this to myself through alcohol.",11,1748718977.0,Cirrhosis,8,1.0,False

Yesterday, I tried to outsmart the VA’s online portal. They said, ""upload your forms in triplicate."" I said ""hold my coffee.""  
Three hours later, I’m knee deep in a browser tab rabbit hole that started with ""How to file a VA claim faster"" and ended with ""Why do cats knock things over?""

Listen, I might be a vet, but this tech stuff? It’s still new terrain. So here’s what I learned this week:

* Password managers are basically digital drill sergeants: ""Use a stronger password, soldier!""
* I turned my PTSD Coach app into a sleep DJ lavender scents, pink noise, and a playlist that would make any monk jealous.
* Apparently, ChatGPT can write VA claim letters better than half the people I served with. Sorry, not sorry.

Oh, and a twist: I finally convinced my phone to stop autocorrecting ""VA claim"" to ""vacuum claim."" Progress.

1l050xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryosleep/comments/1l050xx/splat_five_days_later/,Splat / Five Days Later,"It’s Monday, and the squirrel stirs. 

Its nest retains heat well enough, but isn’t very soft. Among the shredded food-wrappers and that which once resembled denim lays a chewed-up headphone wire and a plastic spoon, cracked neatly down the middle to support her bed. Good things. Familiar. Some of them shiny, which she likes.

She twitches once and her eyes open. Outside of her tree, the sky shines cold gray. The air smells crisp.

Immediately, she’s on the move. Quick and practiced. Down the branch, skip onto the wire, run accross. It’s colder than yesterday. Her stomach aches of empty. No matter. Just motion, pattern, *pace*. She knows where food lives. 

Today, something is different. Next to the usual bin, is a new *thing*. It’s big and made of metal and has little stars shining red and green and blue. The squirrel does not have a name for the machine; neither does she have concept of *machine*. The air around it tastes wrong, though. Its edge feels rougher than bark as she curiously, and cautiously, sniffs it. Still, she eats. Rips her way through a paper bag that rustles softly for something sweet; nuzzles her nose into rough foil for something savoury. A good day, and a full-enough belly that no longer aches.

She loses focus for just a second, enjoying the last licks of savoury, when something makes her startle. A noise, loud and harsh and metal, right behind. The squirrel doesn’t reflect any further than *maybe* *danger*, and off she goes.

Hop, onto the fence. Hop, onto the wire. Full speed ahead, until she for a brief moment thinks about her nest and all of her favourite things. Better not lead the predator that way. She knows another route. Confuse them.

Down from the wire, into the grass. It rustles around her. A dandelion gets caught in her motion and the seeds fly off, gently spreading across the wind to begin life anew. She keeps her eyes ahead, to the other tree. Up that tree, then she can skip home.

Another sound makes her hesitate, for just a second. And then -

*Splat.*

The squirrel’s red fur is form-pressed into the asphalt as her life runs out from her still warm body and onto the asphalt. A crow circling above makes a loud caw.

The thing that took her life doesn’t stop. Doesn’t swerve. Doesn’t notice. It keeps going at the same speed, straight ahead. And life ends.

On Tuesday, the morning stays as gray. Not because of the tragedy that had unfolded underneath it the day before, but because it could. It’s chilly, and most people have prepped with thicker jackets and thin gloves to protect their delicate skins from the air. 

Somewhere, a child is counting each step of her skip on the way to school. One, two, one, two. She notices a crow on a fencepost, and stops. The crow looks at her intently, black feathers reflecting the overall mundaneness of the day. It cocks its head, and lets out a caw. Not really *at her*, but at nothing. She laughs. Crows are weird. 

A man, who just ordered coffee at his usual stop before work, is *angry*. The coffee tastes bland, and the price is not justifiable. He throws his half-finished coffee into a bin that doesn’t fully register as full anymore. For a moment, it flashes red, but then it lights right back up to green. He assumes it’s a bug in the software.

Far above the earth, satellites activate their AI to make tiny adjustments to their orbits. The movements, so small, are not flagged as course corrections - just small realignments. All within normal parameters.

In a suburb, a woman takes out the trash. When she arrives in the recycling room, the bag is nowhere to be found. She later finds it still sitting, tied tightly, right by her front door. She shrugs. *Mom brain*.

On Wednesday, the weather is warmer for the season yet people dress the same. Thin gloves, thicker jackets - not because of the bite of the wind, but because of habit. The air is reminiscent of warm breath on a window pane rather than sun-kissed skin. The clouds are thin, but consistent.

Someone updates their new weather app before going outside. The GPS signal gets caught, and the software confusedly shows the wrong city. They try again. *Transit Node 7B*. They shrug, leave a one star review and get on with their day.

In the city, close to noon, crosswalk signals show green but the sound is five seconds late. A man steps forward, then back. Confused. His phone buzzes, then promptly dies. It had been full that morning, and this annoys him. Short lifecycle, not convenient for daily devices.

The girl who counted her skips on Tuesday is sent home early with what seems to be a never-ending nosebleed. On the ride home, she keeps insisting she saw the sky blink. Twice. Her father tells her to lie down.

In the distance, *every distance*, there’s a click and a bend. No one hears it, no one pays it any mind. Not enough of a shift to care.

The sky is no longer gray on Thursday. It’s white. Flat, dull, unlit. The shadows cast by the living and the inanimate are long and soft, barely noticeable in the misty air.

The city is louder. Its streetlights seem to be on the highest setting even though it’s only morning and leaves behind an echo of a headache in any passerby that happens to look up at them. There’s this *pressure*, just waiting for release. Some conspiracy theorists in an unknown magazine in an unknown nation are the only to publicly make note. 

A man riding an escalator forgets where he was going. Not like a momentary lapse of circumstance, but something that shakes him to his core. The space in his brain, which he is certain previously held an important appointment, now sits inherently blank, and no matter how hard he pushes he gets nothing back.

An elevator in an office building *dings* before someone presses the button. No one reacts to the fact that it had just dropped an unsuspecting group of people on the 32^(nd) floor, too busy with their own day.

A woman opens her phone to 41 unread messages, most of them from people she does not know and with incorrect timestamps. With a sense of unease, she chalks it up to hackers and brings her phone to the IT department.

At 19:29, a child video-calling their grandparent vanishes mid-sentence. The grandparent alerts the parents, who find the room empty. They, of course, call the police. There is no record of the child.

By nightfall, a warm pressure descends again. Not a storm, nor rain. The air just becomes dense, and some people feel an ache in their bones and their teeth. 

A lot of people go to bed early. 

Everywhere, at once, behind the seams, something stirs. Everyone feels it at that moment, but no one knows what to do.

The clock ticks to four minutes past midnight, and Friday begins with a fold, followed by a *split*. No clocks strike. 

Above the city, the sky blinks. It’s not a trick of the light or a flicker of clouds. It’s a momentary shimmer on the dome of the world, on the seam, that’s just vaguely noticeable if you knew exactly where to look.

A nurse has just decided to fetch a coffee after a particularly challenging delivery when it decides that it no longer needs to follow the fundamental rules of physics and instead drifts upwards, sideways, and through the cup. Unbeknownst to her, patients that a moment ago were peacefully sleeping in their beds have vanished. A baby, delivered elsewhere, was born fifteen years after.

Buildings in the city don’t collapse, they unfold. Outer walls of brick and concrete split between invisible lines, become unfurled and sliced so that what is in is not out and what is out may be sideways.

A man, about to swallow his Ativan with a cup of water, sees his hand go straight through the cup. Then through the counter. Through the floor. Through itself. As it does, the city follows: it folds in… half? Not corner to corner, like a piece of paper. More like an ant, squished and rolled between the hands of a child, or a piece of rope rolled back and forth, but just once. 

The once glorious skyscrapers let out a sigh and a ripple, then crumbles. Not downward, but *inward*. Like turning a lung inside out through a small hole, but having nowhere for it to unfurl *into*.

Elevators spool out sideways in perfect trails, like guts, before themselves *furling*. Asphalt boils and liquifies in symmetrical patterns, leaving behind nothing but a trail of breadcrumbs too small to notice.

One moment, the financial district. The next a pattern of red and gray and blue smears pressed into what remains of the ground. 

A thousand lives are cut into unfathomable slices, thinner than individual atoms and with no *time*. Some commuters foot reaches Friday, but the rest of him goes somewhere else.

Some people have thoughts, just for a moment, trying to describe what is happening in front of and behind and between and inside of them, but there are no words.  There are no screams. There is no sound louder than the fold.

From above, at five minutes past midnight, a satellite snaps its monthly image. An imprint of the world so wrong it surely must be a misprint. A glitch in the matrix, a wrongly-layered photoshop file.

Where the city was, is now only a completely flat, glass-like plane. Where there were people and buildings, now nothing. It still gives off some leftover heat, slowly radiating into the empty space above.

At this moment, the pressure *lifts*. The world takes a long, deep breath and lets down its shoulders. No one knows, yet.

The difference between squirrel and man is that man is able to look up into the stars and ponder their existance. Would they notice?

The thing that passed didn’t stop.  
It didn’t swerve.  
It didn’t *notice*.

It kept going to wherever it needed to be, and we will never know if it made it there.",2,1748718731.0,cryosleep,0,1.0,False

We both are heterosexual, single and do not have a partner. I am from South Asia and he is from North Europe. We work in different teams but in same project, so I occasionally see him. We are located in 2 different continents but for work once a year either he or myself travel and we meet in person. The chemistry is off the charts when we first met irl, everyone noticed. He started his flirtatious advances and it was pretty intense (asking me out for date, taking me out for long drive, getting me random confectionary/eatables from his home,staring at me in group meetings, extra nice and protective of me, staring at me from rearvirw mirror). He finds random excuses to involve me in the extra projects he undertakes and texts me absolute random stuff on whatsapp just to stay connected. 

I felt there was some connection and it has been more than an year that I have been crushing on him, I planned to travel to his country for vacation and to meet him n fess up. I told him of my plan to visit his country and he offered to pick me up from airport. When I actually traveled, he came to pick me up, and kissed me when he saw me. This was strange because we had only met in formal settings and have shaken hands. While I was in his country, he asked me out twice, and we went out for drinks. Accidentally I also ended up visiting his house and eventually spending 3 nights (I slept on his sofa and we lived like roommates). I confessed my feelings to him and he said 'Too many compliments' and then diverted the topic. I realized that he was politely declining my proposal.

Final day, before I took my flight, he asked me to visit him. Although it was a working day for him, he spent practically entire morning with and insisted that I go to his home while he will work. At his home he kept me entertained even though he had work calls and also showed me his quirky underwear collection. During lunch time he dropped me on to my further course of journey, gifted me a coffee mug (which reminded him of me) and asked for a kiss before we finally departed.

After I returned home, he texted me that now that I have left, his house feels very empty. He sent me messages on that note for amost a fortnight and then he has gotten hot n cold. Randomly he would share very confidential information 

I am not sure what does this all mean. He still sends me enthusiastic updates about his garden, his pet cats and the random little things around his life. If he is not interested in me or if he does not reciprocate my feelings, then why is he entertaining me at all ?",4,1748718700.0,Advice,18,0.75,False

Just venting.","I stayed up working until 4:00 a.m., finally crashed, only to be jolted awake at 7:00 by a freight train blaring its horn five times. It didn’t pass through, it just stopped at the intersection, dropped its carts, and just sat there.

Over the next hour, it blasted its horn three more times, two other separate sections, all while still parked. That’s three full sessions of honking during one stop.

Then the engine started idling in this awful low-hover mode that caused a deep, bone-rattling vibration. I could feel it in my bones. It finally pulled away around 8:10.

A bit of context: we stupidly bought a home about 100 feet from active train tracks. It felt like a decent starter home at the time—annoying but manageable. Now the traffic has tripled, the noise is unbearable, and with my sound and sensory sensitivities, every train feels like a full-body stress trigger.

So when the next train came through—before 8:45—with four more horn blasts, I screamed. I was overwhelmed, overstimulated, and just emotionally done. Now getting them back to back like this is rare, and ofcourse it's today.

Seeing how stressed I was, my husband gently suggested we go get breakfast. I reminded him we couldn’t since we were waiting for a contractor scheduled to arrive around 10:00. So, he offered to order food instead. That lifted my mood a little. I picked my favorite breakfast meal and added a horchata latte I was excited to try.

While we waited, yet another train passed. Still more horn blasts. Shorter train, but the damage was done. I stormed off to calm down.

Our order finally arrives and of course, my favorite part, the poblano sauce, is missing. I’m barely keeping it together. We call the restaurant, and while we’re on hold for 10 minutes, my husband suggests I enjoy the latte to help reset. Coffee is usually my one little moment of peace and solace.

I take a sip… and it tastes like horchata. That’s it. No espresso. No hint of caffeine. Just sweet milk.

Now I’m enraged again.

When someone finally picks up, we explain the missing sauce and ask for a refund, since we’re not going to drive back for it. Then we ask about the latte, and the employee says she made it herself and used one shot of espresso.

I almost lost it.

“One shot? In a 16 oz latte? That’s not even a latte.” I explained that most standard lattes use two shots. She replied, “That’s our recipe.” I asked how many shots go in their other lattes. She said, “Two.”

So I said, “If this one is different but it’s not listed anywhere, how would anyone know?” At this point, I’m visibly upset, angry, and on the verge of melting down.

We hang up. I finally try to eat.

And like clockwork—another train. More horns. It was 10:05. I just laughed. I didn't know what to do or how to feel.

Shortly after, my husband looks at me and says, “It’s 10:30. The contractor’s a no-call, no-show.”

So, we could’ve gone out to breakfast after all.

It’s 12:00 now. I’m going to bed. Today is over.

Hi all, so it’s Saturday today. All week I’ve only had at most 1 meal and 1 shake (the shake is nutritious but maybe 5-600kcal max). Just been busy. On Thursday I had the shake and managed to make some pasta. On Friday I woke up with extreme cramps, 10/10 pain where all you can do is try to get through it. Extreme diarrhea. After about an hour of that (happened in the morning) I went back to bed because it was such a tiring experience. I woke up around 3pm. Missed many things I was supposed to do that day. Around 3:30pm I made a shake and a coffee. By 9:30pm the shake was finally done. I didn’t manage to build up enough of an appetite to eat or drink anything else. 

Today I woke up feeling badly and now I am really struggling to get up out of bed. I feel exhausted even though I’m oversleeping. I can’t push myself to get up. I feel awful. Not hungry, just awful. It’s hard to concentrate and it feels like everything is so slow. I don’t have much food but can make a shake the moment I get up. 

Is this just me being lazy? Why can’t I push through? I really have to take my dog outside for a pee, but the thought of changing clothes and stuff just sounds awful. I am really struggling. I don’t know what to do to make myself feel better. I don’t think it’s starvation per se because I’m not hungry and besides yesterday, I’ve had at least 1500kcal a day. Judging by my urine from yesterday I’m not dehydrated. So I don’t know why I’m feeling so lazy and can’t get up :( it’s like my body just wants to give up instead of get up.

Hi everyone! Happy Festa!! 

It’s been 3 years, 7 enlistments, 11 solo albums, and a heck of a lot of new music, but I’m back with an updated discography guide! 

For older armys who want to go back and celebrate their discography as BTS finally reunite, or for new armys that want to explore BTS’ music and need a place to start, this discography guide includes every song ever released by BTS and its members. The 12 categories are organized by mood/sound to create playlist-sized groups that are easily explored or shared. The guide includes every song released between June 2013 to May 2025 (yes, every single one) 

And this year I’ve added custom Spotify Playlists! To find them, just screenshot the Spotify Code next to the playlist you want, select the camera icon at the top of the Spotify Search page, and choose “Select from photos”. (it might not work the first time but it should work after a few tries. try to zoom in more and take a new screenshot if it gives you some trouble)

Link to Main Playlist: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3ofZ4VaQrKkgE8KaDKxP1b?si=V1JsibuzS669Gd30ngfv9Q&pi=EnHxvW9yTOuOE

The rest of the playlists can be found on my Spotify profile. 

Hope you like it!

Here’s what happened when I tried detox tea for 6 weeks,"I’m not big on trends, especially when it comes to “detox” products. But earlier this year, I hit a wall with my digestion. No matter what I ate - salads, smoothies, even plain rice - I’d end up feeling bloated and sluggish for the rest of the day. It was frustrating and exhausting.

I didn’t want a quick fix or a crash diet. I just wanted something gentle to support my system while I tried to get things back on track. That’s when I started looking into detox teas - not the harsh ones, but something plant-based and designed for daily use.

After a bit of research, I settled on one that seemed legit and had decent reviews. I committed to drinking it every day for six weeks and decided to track the changes along the way.

**What I was looking for (and what I wasn’t)**

I didn’t expect this tea to “cleanse my toxins” or make me drop 10 pounds. What I wanted was:

* Less bloating
* More regular digestion
* A bit more natural energy
* Something to replace my second coffee

And to my surprise, that’s more or less what I got.

**What’s actually in a good detox tea?**

The one I used wasn’t just green tea and flavoring. It had **13 real ingredients**, including:

* **Matcha**, **sencha**, and **oolong teas** for metabolism and antioxidants
* **Yerba mate** and **guarana** for light, steady energy
* **Dandelion** and **milk thistle** to support liver and digestion
* **Nettle leaf**, **lemongrass**, **goji berries**, and **ginseng** to help reduce inflammation
* **Stevia leaf** as a natural sweetener (no added sugar)

It’s worth noting it was **vegan, gluten-free, and soy-free**, and only had a small amount of caffeine, around 18mg per cup. Enough to wake me up, but never too much.

**My 6-week detox tea experience**

I kept it simple: one cup every morning, before or after breakfast. I didn’t overhaul my meals or follow a strict plan - just aimed to eat balanced meals and walk most days.

**Week 1–2:**  
The first noticeable shift was how *light* I felt after meals. The bloating I normally carried around all day started to ease up. I wasn’t feeling stuffed or weighed down after eating, even on days when I wasn’t eating super clean.

**Week 3–4:**  
My digestion became more predictable and regular, without discomfort or urgency. I also started skipping my usual afternoon coffee without even realizing it. My energy felt more balanced, and I didn’t crash mid-afternoon like usual.

**Week 5–6:**  
I weighed myself at the end and was about 4.2 pounds lighter - not from dieting, but probably from a combination of reduced inflammation and better habits. The bigger deal for me was how my stomach *looked* and *felt* \- flatter, lighter, and way less gassy.

**Any side effects?**

If you’ve had a bad experience with detox teas, I get it. I’ve tried ones that were basically glorified laxatives, and they wrecked my stomach. This one was **nothing like that**.

No cramps, no surprises, no running to the bathroom. Just gentle support. The only thing I noticed was I needed to drink a bit more water than usual, but that’s pretty normal with herbal teas.

**Where I got it (watch out for fakes)**

I bought it directly from the [**official website**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST) because I’d heard of fake products being sold on third-party sites.

Here’s also a [**backup link**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?uid=34821&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST) with the same offer in case the first one’s slow. They had a 70% off deal when I ordered mine, and it came in about 5 days.

**So... was it worth it?**

Honestly, yes. Drinking a daily detox tea isn’t going to magically fix everything, but it really did help me feel more like myself again. It gave my digestion the reset it needed and helped me rebuild some better habits without pressure or restriction.

If you’re struggling with similar issues - bloating, low energy, unpredictable digestion, it might be worth trying something gentle and plant-based to support your system.

Anyone else used a detox tea for similar reasons? Would love to hear what worked (or didn’t) for you. Did you notice any changes in energy or bloating? Any **detox tea side effects** I didn’t run into? Curious to hear other experiences.",1,1748718092.0,HowToLoseWeightFST,0,1.0,False

1l04r6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/usj/comments/1l04r6h/usj_experience_of_a_theme_park_newbie_during/,USJ: Experience of a Theme Park Newbie during Golden Week,"It’s been a month since my trip to Japan during Golden Week, including visiting USJ on 1 May 2025. This subreddit had been an invaluable resource in planning for my trip. I’m writing this trip report to relive the memories, and to pay it forward by sharing my experience to hopefully help future trip-planners.

# The Context

I visited USJ on 1 May 2025 with my SO. This was my virgin trip to Japan, and my first proper trip to a theme park (I’ve also been to USS once many years ago but only for an evening). My SO had a few prior trips to other parts of Japan, but this was her first time around this region. She had also visited other theme parks many years ago, none recent. I would describe myself as being the adventurous half; My SO was the squeamish one and would rather not take roller coasters if she was given the choice. However, she said that she was willing to brave all the rides (except Backdrop) with me for my sake. We are both acquainted with but not superfans of the franchises featured in USJ.

We had no idea our Japan trip coincided with Golden Week. We had not even planned our itinerary until a little more than 2 months prior to our trip when we finally decided to include USJ in our itinerary. The realisation that our trip coincided with Golden Week weighed heavily on our decision to purchase an express pass. We saw this trip as once-in-a-lifetime and so we wanted to try everything that the park has to offer. Given the fear-mongering about the insane crowds we should expect during Golden Week, we decided to get an express pass in addition to the studio pass to make the trip count.

# Buying the Passes

Based on my reading, we had 3 main options for purchasing the tickets –Klook, USJ (English) and USJ (Japanese). In our eyes:

* Klook is a well-regarded third-party vendor with user-friendly interface and information that were synthesised for ease of consumption. We had experience with using Klook, so it was a familiar platform to navigate.
* USJ (English) had the advantage of being a first-party website in our native language. That’s it. We read about the poor availability of passes in comparison to its Japanese counterpart.
* USJ (Japanese) somehow has passes for the days where USJ (English) wouldn’t. However, we were concerned that information may get lost in translation and we were aware about the potential rejection of non-Japanese credit cards which could jeopardise our purchase attempts.

Our strategy was:

* Klook > USJ (English) > USJ (Japanese)
* Express Pass 7 (Minecart and Selection) > Express Pass 7 (Variety Theatre) > Any Express Pass 4 with access to Koopa’s Challenge, Mine Cart Madness, and Forbidden Journey.
* Our lack of itinerary planning gave us the flexibility of either 1 or 2 May, which were the days we had in Osaka that could accommodate a full-day activity.

During end-Feb I did a search on Klook which informed me that the set of passes for the month of May would be released in batches on 5 March at 12:00 (GMT +9). I set my calendar reminder and didn’t do any further search on whether the official USJ platforms also released their May passes at the same time.

Come 5 March, I had just finished working night shift and I was supposed to be heading to bed at the stipulated time but here I was camping my phone, furiously refreshing my Klook app to try and snag the passes. 12:00 (GMT +9) came and went. Nothing. I continued refreshing the app non-stop for the next 40 mins. Then at 12:40 (GMT +9), the calendar for the month of May suddenly lit up, but to my dismay the Express Pass 7 for the 2 days that we have shortlisted were INSTANTLY sold out. I continued to refresh the app in denial, and expanded my search to include Express Pass 4, but only the less desirable combinations were still available on those 2 dates. We then attempted several times to access the USJ (English) website but the website couldn’t load. After 30 mins of futile efforts, I decided to cut my losses and head to bed filled with adrenaline, disappointment, and anger, as I still had to work night shift the next day. I tasked my SO to continue to refresh the app hoping that there were more passes to come.

There weren’t. I woke up to an equally disappointed SO, who spent the day refreshing the Klook app to no avail. She even managed to finally enter the USJ (English) website which were all sold out by then. We then resorted to the USJ (Japanese) website.

(Un)surprisingly, there were plenty of Express Pass 7 still available on our desired dates. She immediately pounced on the opportunity, although the USJ (Japanese) website was a hot mess and had a terrible design not befitting of such a company in 2025. After several frustrating attempts, we finally got to check out our desired passes (with less than desirable timings, but we take what we can!). The website prompted us to provide a Japanese address and phone number, but we had not booked any accommodations yet. We figured that no one was really checking, so we searched up a random hotel to “borrow” their details. After even more buggy checking-out process, we finally managed to get a hold of our ticket! The trip was happening!

The Studio Pass costed us JPY 10,900 per adult, and the Express Pass costed us JPY 25,800 per adult.

Our pass granted us the following time-designated entry:

* 14:50 Super Nintendo World
* 14:50\~15:20 Mario Kart \~Bowser's Challenge\~
* 15:20\~15:50 Yoshi's Adventure
* 15:50\~16:20 Donkey Kong's Crazy Mine Cart
* 17:30 Wizarding World of Harry Potter
* 17:50\~18:20 Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey
* 18:20\~18:50 Flight of the Hippogriff

As well as the following:

* Choose one: Jaws, OR Jurassic Park - The Ride
* Choose one: The Flying Dinosaur, OR Minion Mayhem Ride

# The Preparation

Buying the ticket was the easy part. Planning for the trip was an endeavour by itself, and at the end of it I felt like I had already visited the park without having stepped foot in there.

We were aware about the SNW rope-dropping strategy that many people employ, regardless of whether they had express passes or not. We decided to work our strategy around that, given that our pass already guarantees us access to SNW and the rides within. Instead, we focused the precious first few hours on covering other rides in the park that our pass didn’t account for.

Our plan:

* Arrive early (at least 1 hr 45 mins before the official opening time, as it is common knowledge that the park opens its gates around 1 hr before)
* Head for the rides not covered by our pass (namely Space Fantasy and Hollywood Dream, then one of the 2 rides for each of the choose-ones). Take the normal line where possible to enjoy the rides together, but willing to take single-rider lines if necessary.
* Once the lines were long, use our express pass for the other of the 2 rides for each of the choose-ones.
* Our guaranteed SNW access timing wasn’t great. Regularly check the USJ app to obtain an earlier timed entry for SNW, preferably around 13:00.
* If all the above were done before our timed entry to SNW, kill time and soak up the vibes at Universal Wonderland.
* Once in SNW, head straight to Kinopio’s Café to obtain a reservation, then use the remaining time to enjoy SNW and complete the Key challenges. Have lunch at Kinopio’s Café, then cash in on the express pass for SNW rides.
* Once we were done with SNW, head to the Wizarding World. Enjoy the area until the time comes to use up the last of our express pass.
* Clean up any unfinished business in the park.

Other preparation work:

* Check the official opening and closing time – These differ on a daily basis. On the day of our visit, this was from 09:00 to 20:00
* Download the USJ app – However we did not familiarise ourselves with the app beforehand. We also could not find reliable information online on how/whether it was possible/whether we should register park passes beforehand, so we didn’t.
* Check the weather and plan the outfit accordingly – The temperature was expected to range from the lows of low-teens to the highs of mid-twenties. We each opted for comfy long-pants, a light T-shirt, and a light jacket.
* Pre-purchase a light konbini breakfast on the night before the trip, to save us precious time on the morning itself – We ended up buying breakfast only on the morning itself anyways as we weren’t happy with the selection the night before.
* Pack your bags accordingly, as lightly as possible
* Ensure you have at least one 100-yen coin – For the lockers

# The Trip

06:00 Woke up and prepared to leave.

06:30 Dropped by the konbini near our hotel to pick up the breakfast that we were supposed to have done the night before but didn’t. We each got 1 onigiri and 1 bread, stuffed into my sling bag, as well as each hand-carrying a bottle of coffee to start the day.

06:45 Reached the metro, and made our way to USJ. Once we reached Nishikujō Station to transition to the JR Yumesaki line for Universal-City Station, you could just follow the crowd. Everybody else seemed to know where they were going.

07:15 Reached Universal-City Station, and starting walking towards USJ. Once again, follow the crowd. People were running the moment they got off the metro. We figured that at this point, running wouldn’t have made a significant difference, so we just opted to take a leisurely walk. On the way we paused intermittently to take pictures of notable landmarks.

07:20 Security check. We had to go through security before joining the queue. We hadn’t had breakfast and the food were still in my bag. We had read mixed experiences with security with regards to bringing food through – Some reported nonchalance whereas others said that they were extremely strict about not bringing outside food. We decided to head for security anyways and to eat the food on the spot if they protested. My SO put her bottle of coffee and her tiny crossbody bag through the scanner and it went through without a hitch. I did the same with my bottle of coffee and my bag but I was stopped. I opened my bag, showing my stash of breakfast immediately with no attempts to hide the food. The security picked up our bottles of coffee and asked what was inside (even though it was blindingly obvious). They then looked at the food in my bag, reminded us to not eat them in the park, and let us be on our way. They didn’t even lift up the bread to see what was underneath (it was my tumbler which was probably what flagged up on the scanner anyway).

07:25 Joined a queue forming on the left side (far end) of the gate. The number of people at the gates slowly dawned upon us. It was a controlled chaos as it was packed but everyone was in neat queues. We were situated almost at the barriers, just beyond the sheltered areas for the ticket kiosks. As I was expecting the park to only open at 08:00 (1 hour before the official opening hours), I decided to use the time to start eating my bread, while my SO chose to postpone her breakfast.

07:30 The background music stopped, and a different music started playing. The announcer began her speech to declare the park open. It took me a while to realise that the park was opening sooner than anticipated, which set me into a mild panic as I hadn’t figured out how the app or the QR code worked. I rushed to finish my bread while trying to Google how to register my park passes. I tried to take a screenshot of the QR codes of my passes on my email and uploading them to the app, however an error messaged kept popping up. In frustration, I got my SO to register our passes using her app first, before sending her the screenshots for me to scan off her phone. This workaround worked thankfully.

07:40 The queue was moving slower than anticipated. People were sprinting away towards SNW the moment they were in. Our queue was held up by a group of 3 just before us. 1 of them had issues with their pass and spent a good chunk of time trying to reason with the poor gantry staff, before finally heading to for customer service.

07:50 We were finally in! We felt no need to run for any attraction. We headed straight for Space Fantasy, which took us on a path that broke off from the shortest path towards SNW. All the chaos that we experienced for the past hour instantly faded away as this part of the park was secluded at this point.

07:55 Space Fantasy. Reached with barely any visitors around. 2 staffs eagerly ushered us in. We dropped off our belongings into the locker, then zipped right past the non-existent queue (even though the wait-time display said 15 mins) and were on right away. We didn’t know what type of ride this was beforehand, and were quite rudely (but pleasantly) shocked to find that it was a spinning roller coaster. I found it quite an enjoyable ride. My SO said that she surprisingly enjoyed it even though this was clearly something outside her comfort zone, and this was quite a way to wake her up after dragging her out of bed way too early in the morning. She said that this would be a ride that she could repeat. Checking in on my USJ app, a timed SNW entry ticket was not available for reservation yet.

08:02 Joined back up with the main artery. People were still making a beeline for SNW. We headed for Hollywood Dream. We were through the line and boarded the ride within 5 mins even though the quoted waited time was 15 mins. Backdrop had a modest queue that wouldn’t have taken the quoted 20 mins. We were supposed to be able to choose from 5 songs while on the ride, but mashing the buttons did nothing, and we were stuck listening to some Japanese tunes. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this ride a lot. My SO said that this ride was too much for her. I would’ve loved to ride this again, or perhaps even try Backdrop, but we’ll give that a pass for now. Still no luck with the timed entry tickets yet.

* Belongings: Shelf (free; unsecured)

08:18 Head for Jaws as it was the next closest ride on our plan. We arrived at 08:23 to find that the pier was completely empty! We waltzed right in, and were joined by a few other patrons. We set off on a boat that was barely half-filled. Quite frankly this ride felt disappointing, although credits to the boat guide with his enthusiasm and bravery. Timed entry tickets are still not available on the USJ app…is this thing working? Am I holding it wrong?

* Belongings: Bring on board
* Spectacles: Allowed
* Items in pockets (e.g. phones): Allowed

08:40 Head for Jurassic Park next. As we’ve secured Jurassic Park – The Ride at this point with our express pass, we went for The Flying Dinosaur first. I couldn’t remember the posted wait times for the normal queue, but it was fake news once again.

This was the only ride that was strict with their no loose-items policy. We were issued a ticket with a QR code that could be scanned at the lockers to assign and unlock the lockers subsequently. We then had to go through a security check with metal detectors. This was the ride I enjoyed the most, although it leaves me wondering if I would’ve enjoyed it even more had I been able to wear my spectacles to enjoy the view in HD…or perhaps ignorance is bliss. Even the lady also said that she loved the ride, and would consider taking it again. Wasn’t Hollywood Dream too extreme for her? She works in mysterious ways…

* Belongings: Locker (free; QR code ticket)
* Spectacles: NOT allowed
* Items in pockets (e.g. phones): NOT allowed

08:55 My memory of obtaining a timed SNW entry ticket is hazy, but this was about when it became available for reservation. The time slots were not ideal at the point, offering a selection from 09:00, 10:00, or 11:00. I did not realise that pressing into any of the offered time slots offered a more granular entry window, so I decided to pass it up for now.

Jurassic Park - The Ride was just next door. The normal queue was still non-existent at this point, so we went for that, saving our express pass to repeat rides again if time allowed. While waiting, we saw many riders donning ponchos. We weren’t keen on getting wet but hadn’t gone the extra mile and were hoping to just not get put in the front seats. That was exactly what happened, and we decided to just roll with it. The seats already had puddles from the previous splashdown, so we already had a wet start to the ride. The splashdown left our top halves soaked, but not as bad as we had anticipated – It was actually rather welcomed as the weather was starting to warm up.

09:15 We felt a tinge of regret at this point as we breezed through much of the park without encountering much crowd or queue and probably could’ve gotten away without buying the express pass at all. Feeling like we had a bit of time, we noticed that Mission Walk was nearby, so we decided to try it. We were issued a booklet and briefed on how to complete our quest.

While roaming about mindlessly, we continued to check our USJ app and the next batch of timed SNW entry ticket at 12:00 were released. We decided to deviate from our plan and to go for a 12:00 entry to give us more time to enjoy SNW, since we have already completed most of the activity outside of SNW at this point. Pressing into the 12:00 timeslot revealed additional timeslots available for selection (I believe they were staggered in 10 min-intervals, and each specific timeslot allows for entry up to 1 hour from the starting time e.g. selecting a timeslot of 12:40 allows you to enter SNW between 12:40\~13:40). We got the 12:00\~13:00 timeslot.

Back to our mission – Our performance was embarrassing. It took us almost an hour to complete the mission, having to go back to ask for additional help as we were clueless despite using both hints for the last quest. At the end of it, we were rewarded with a set of cute dinosaur-themed stickers for our efforts. Mission complete!

10:15 Having completed everything in Jurassic Park, we headed for Minion Park. We stopped by Banana Cabana and Space Killer. The grand prizes up for grabs were adorable, but we felt that the price to play was steep, although players who lost still walked away with consolation prizes. We spent some time living vicariously through others, and cheering for the winners.

10:30 It was time to redeem our first express pass for Minion Mayhem. We were unsure how to display our express pass on the USJ app, but turns out all we had to do was to show our email displaying the QR code together with the ride names and times to the staff. The first staff at the start of the express queue checked whether we had the pass with the applicable ride (and at the applicable time, if any). The second staff further into the queue scanned our QR codes. This was our first time seeing a sizable queue at the normal queue, and there was an odd satisfaction to simply walk right past everyone else.

We were ushered into a waiting room with TVs playing scenes of the Minions, although in Japanese. The plot of the ride was introduced whereby we were supposed to undergo a process of becoming a Minion. We were then whisked along to another room where an even longer scene was played, before we were finally split into smaller groups to enter the rides in separate areas.

We were supposed to bring our belongings onto the ride and to put it in the space in front of us. However, the other guests in front of us set their belongings on the floor outside the ride and the staff didn’t protest, so we followed. This was a motion simulator with a scene being projected onto a domed screen, giving an illusion of being on a roller coaster as part of the wacky antics that the Minions are usually up to. The projection felt dim and inadequately sharp, failing to fully immerse me in the scenes. This was the only ride that left me a little queasy, but it was still relatively enjoyable.

11:00 We had nothing planned until our timed SNW entry. We popped by the souvenir store to browse for a while, before an impromptu decision to catch the Doraemon 4-D movie. The wait-time display showed 20 mins but we were in after 5. We finally had a chance to sit down properly, although the seats were rock hard. Turns out the seats could also jiggle us about and spray jets of air or water at us. It was a good rest and an interesting experience but otherwise nothing spectacular.

11:45 We started to make our way towards SNW. We reached the entrance at about 11:55 and there was a huge line of people waiting to enter. We gradually shuffled forward to have our timed SNW entry ticket checked and scanned, and were in at 12 sharp.

Entering SNW proper felt like sensory overload. Clearly, everywhere else in USJ felt less crowded because everyone was here. We had little time to take in the décor just yet as we headed straight for Kinopio’s Café. We had read that a new set of reservation drops on the hour, so we wanted to catch that ASAP. We reached at 12:05 and scanned the QR code outside the restaurant to attempt to make a reservation. I had issues loading the webpage so I had to get a staff to help me troubleshoot (that was on me – My browser app had location permissions turned off, which the webpage needed). My SO had no issues, but there were already no slots available for reservation. Feeling bummed out, we decided to explore around first while waiting for the next set of reservations.

12:15 We found a pushcart selling the power-up bands that had no queue. We grabbed 1 Toad-themed band (JPY 4,900) for the both of us. This was the only purchase within the park that was cashless-only. With our new-found power, we started roaming around punching blocks that we could find.

12:25 Goomba Crazy Crank. It took us a while to figure out how to use the map to find the stations for Key Challenges. We queued for about 15 mins. This was a solo-challenge and simply involved going to town spinning the crank to cause the Goomba to fall off the rolling hill to complete the challenge. My SO did it and it didn’t seem particularly difficult.

As we left, we checked back on our browser and miraculously a single café reservation timeslot opened up for 12:45. We rushed to place the reservation but the process was foreign to us. You had to make a reservation using Line or email – we opted for email. You had to fill in your email address and be redirected to your email app to send a default email to their receiving email address, then return to the browser to check on the outcome of your reservation. Our attempt failed but this disproved our working theory that new reservations only drop at the turn of the hour.

12:40 Piranha Plant Nap Mishap. We were through the queue in 5 mins. This was a group-challenge and since we only had 1 band, the staff paired us up with other park-goers. My SO was teamed up with 2 little Japanese children. There were many gigantic clocks around and the goal was to silence the ones that were flashing and ringing so as to put the Piranha Plant back to sleep. The 2 kids carried my SO to success!

12:50 Koopa Troopa Power Punch. This queue took 15 mins, but it felt much longer as the sun was out in full force at this point. We continued checking our browser for new café reservations. A few minutes before 13:00, a new set of reservations popped up but this time we were more familiar with the process. We managed to clinch a reservation for 14:00!

This was also a solo-challenge testing your reaction and timing. There was a green shell going back and forth through a tunnel and the goal was to set off a chain reaction using the pow blocks to blast the green shell upwards. You had 3 attempts to do so, and on the third attempt the staff will assist you by telling you exactly when to tap the first block, although success is not guaranteed. As a spectator I felt that this was not too difficult if you had watched the previous players who completed it successfully to catch the timing. My SO clearly wasn’t paying attention and we ended up failing the challenge. The sound effect played when you failed was utterly disappointing! By then the queue had grown even longer and we weren’t keen on queueing up to try again. We decided to move on to the next station.

13:15 Bob-omb Kaboom Room. This was in a sheltered area with air-condition which was very welcomed. There was a ginormous ? block in the waiting area. The queue took about 10 mins. This was another group-challenge, for which we were paired up with a Chinese mum with her kid. Bob-omb had destroyed a key and the pieces were scattered – We had to run around to retrieve the key pieces, then return to the central touchscreen to reassemble the key, and if you took too long then the game will reset for a total of 3 attempts. My SO passed me the band for me to take on the challenge. The touchscreen couldn’t detect swiping actions very well and so dragging the key pieces to reassemble the jigsaw puzzle was harder than it looked, but nonetheless we managed to complete the challenge, netting us the last key that we needed to take on Bowser Jr.

13:30 Bowser Jr Shadow Showdown. Ended up here thinking it was Thwomp Panel Panic. We had to scan our band before entering and it checked whether we had 3 keys. There was no queue and after we entered, we had to wait a while for additional players to join. I was placed in the hot seat once again, with 2 other players. In the waiting area, there were 2 screens on either side of the entrance. The screen on the right showed the instructions in Japanese whereas the one on the left was in English. My eyes were focused on the right screen for a good chunk of time before I realised English subtitles were on the left, so I missed out on the story and instruction. We appeared as shadows on a screen. We had to swipe falling Bob-ombs, jump or duck from Bullet Bills and fireballs, and cast fireballs at flying Koopas and Bowser Jr. This was quite a chaotic game with multiple things happening simultaneously and I was exhausted afterwards.

13:35 Thwomp Panel Panic. There was a modest queue ahead of us but thankfully this was also indoors. This was supposed to be a group-challenge but we watched one player complete the challenge solo. A group of 4 Chinese tourists before ours completed their challenge, but keys were only issued to 2 of their bands, leaving them frustrated and kicking up a fuss with the staff who was powerless in resolving their issue and had to escort them out to keep the queue moving. My SO was grouped with 3 other players. The game involves tapping the touchscreen to convert all blue ? blocks into yellow ! blocks but the blocks will flip back occasionally. If you could not do it fast enough, your progress will reset for a total of 3 attempts. Our first try at the game resulted in a failure so we exited.

Since we had time to spare, we went right back in and this time there was no queue at all! I went for the second try. This game once again feels like it was hampered by the poor touchscreen sensitivity as tapping doesn’t seem to result in any change sometimes which was frustrating. We failed our second attempt (it totally wasn’t me!). Since it was almost time for our café reservation, we decided to ditch the game for now and headed out to take in more of the surrounding and theming, and of course take more pictures.

13:55 We arrived at the café and showed the staff the email confirmation of our reservation. While waiting in the modest queue, we could scan the QR code atop one of the queue poles to access the menu to browse and place our order ahead of time. We ordered the Chef’s Special: Omelet Rice with Shrimp and Mushroom Cream Stew (JPY 2,400), Super Mushroom Pizza Bowl with Mushroom Tomato Sauce (JPY 1,700), and ? Block Tiramisu (JPY 950)

Once ordered, a QR code was issued, which we showed the cashier to expedite the ordering and payment process (physical menus were also available at the counter for the less technologically-inclined). This entire process took us 5 mins. We were issued our queue number, and were ushered along to the next queue to wait to be seated. If you had ordered drinks, pick them up here. We waited for about 5 mins before we were invited into the restaurant proper to be seated.

After we were seated, the food took an additional 10 mins to be served. The food tasted unremarkable and the portion wasn’t big– It was adequate to quell my hunger but not to fill me up (although we saw other guests order pasta and the servings were huge!). However, the theming of the food was absolutely adorable for the tiramisu and the pizza bowl (although we hoped that the mushroom head would’ve been poofier) and that was what we were paying a premium for. There was a water station tucked away in one corner for patrons to self-serve cups of water and to fill up your bottles with.

14:50 It was time to take on Bowser's Challenge. The theming in Bowser’s Castle was absolutely on point and I was trying my best to take in everything and snapping some quick photos without holding up the other riders behind me. As we were walking through the line for the express pass, we caught glimpse of the normal queue with an insanely long queue. We were issued our visors and eagerly put them on (don’t bother, it’s uncomfortable after a while and you only need to put it on before you boarded the ride). At the 7 min mark, we were whisked into the briefing room, which was themed to be the driver’s changing room, with the suits and helmets of various Mario Kart characters. The TV screens were playing instructions on what to do during the ride, such as steering, aiming and shooting the shells, and how to earn coins. After the briefing, we moved on down what appeared to be an endless flight of stairs as the ride harboured a huge queue of riders hidden out of sight.

It took us an additional 13 mins after the briefing to finally board the ride. The AR headset snapped onto the visors automagically and I reminded my SO to scan her power-up band on the ride’s steering wheel. The briefing felt like a distant memory at this point and I had to spend some time getting used to the HUD (which had a narrow field of vision) and recalling what I had to do. We had to turn the steering wheels in the correct direction at the correct time, pick up power-ups, turn our head around to look for enemies to shoot shells at, while trying to avoid hitting allies – It felt like a cognitive and sensory overload which felt exactly like Mario Kart, although the actual speed of the ride was slow. I ended the ride with a grand total of 99 coins – 1 coin shy of the 100 coins required to win the challenge! Thankfully my SO wielded the power-up band and fared much better than me.

15:20 Exited Bowser’s Castle via 1UP Factory, where we spent time browsing the souvenirs. We then headed for Yoshi's Adventure. There was a queue within the ride itself waiting for the next car even after redeeming our express pass to skip the queue outside the ride, taking us about 7 mins. Temper your expectations – or perhaps don’t even think about it as a ride but instead as a slow scenic train ride chugging along above SNW and use the opportunity to take in the sights from a different angle, and you might be less disappointed. There were buttons for 3 coloured Yoshi eggs on the panel that we were supposed to press if we spotted them while the ride was chugging along, but we weren’t sure what this achieved.

15:45 We were ready to move on from SNW into Donkey Kong Country. We were greeted by the madness that was the queue for Mine Cart Madness, which extended out way beyond the ride entrance. We whipped out our express pass once again to bypass the flocks of people, but once again we had to queue for 15 mins within the ride before we could board our cart. This ride felt so whacky and lived up to its name. My SO ranked this her favourite out of all rides – This is high praise coming from someone so timid!

16:15 Spent some time at the Slot Machine Barrel, and just taking in the scenery overall. The queue for Rambi’s Bongo Breakout was pretty ridiculous. Once we were done with this area (which was quite small), it was time to exit SNW and move on to the next area.

16:30 Detoured back to Jurassic Park to grab a Turkey leg (JPY 1,400). We found a bench to sit and eat while watching riders get drenched from the splashdown. As we were leaving, we unintentionally bumped into the Jurassic World Dino Encounter. We stayed to watch a Stegosaurus and an Ankylosaurus strut around for a bit and feed. It was amusing to watch even if we knew that none of this was real. We wondered if there would be a T-rex that burst out from behind the trees but didn’t stay to find out.

17:00 Wizarding World. This was free-access, unlike what our express pass implied. We were greeted by the iconic car abandoned in the woods. We then spent some time walking around Hogsmeade and browsing the various shops. Neither of us were super fans so we decided not to buy a wand for ourselves, instead opting to watch others do it. We heard many comments that the wand doesn’t work as it should (end user problem?). We grabbed some Frozen Butterbeer (in a non-souvenir disposable plastic cup, JPY 900) from the cart in the middle. It reminded me of the syrup that comes with hotcakes from McDonalds, but in a slushie form. It was too sweet for my liking but I imagine this would be refreshing on a hot afternoon.

17:50 We were supposed to head for our next ride, but we unintentionally bumped into another show (Hippogriff Magical Lesson). The show involved a mix of Asian and Western cast, performed in a mix of English and Japanese. We stayed for the entire duration of about 10 mins, before heading for Forbidden Journey. The ride looked empty and the quoted wait-time was 20 mins for the normal queue. We nonetheless redeemed our express pass and made our way in. We were led into dungeon with a huge locker area to store our belongings. We spent some time trying to figure out how to insert the 100-yen coin that we had been using, only to realise that the lockers here did not require any coins. There was almost no queue to get onto the ride. The ride brought us through notable scenes throughout the franchise (warning for people with arachnophobia!) using a combination of projections and real sets. I wasn’t able to work out how exactly the ride was moving us through the various scenes but it was a fantastic experience even for casual enjoyers of the franchise.

* Belongings: Locker (free; lock-and-key)
* Spectacles: Allowed
* Items in pockets (e.g. phones): Allowed

??:?? My phone battery was dying after stressing it for the whole day, so there were no photos for this timestamp. We headed for our last express pass ride: Flight of the Hippogriff. The normal queue for this ride was pretty long. The staff had switched over to prioritising the normal queue – Each car was being filled by mostly guests from the normal queue and interspersed with express queue guests. We were in the queue for about 15 mins before we got our turn. It was quite a mild ride with gentle drops and mostly turns and banks to make up most of the thrill. It was over so quickly that I felt a little underwhelmed, but my SO said that this was just the right thrill level for her.

* Belongings: Shelf (free; unsecured)
* Spectacles: Allowed
* Items in pockets (e.g. phones): Allowed

18:45 We had completed everything that we set out to do. We debated on how to use the remaining time. We wanted to repeat rides that we enjoyed the most with reasonable queue times (Space Fantasy or The Flying Dinosaur), but also wanted to allocate some time to actually grabbing some souvenirs after spending time throughout the day window-shopping. Had I had more time, I would’ve wanted to drop by Jurassic Park – The Ride or JAWS to give away our 2 unused express passes but philanthropy wasn’t my top priority. We decided to head towards the Hollywood area where most of the shops are located to secure the souvenirs we had in mind, then to swing by Space Fantasy and ride it as many times as we could before the park closes. We picked up a Toad and Toadette plushie (JPY 2,600 each). We then rode Space Fantasy 2 more times before the ride stopped accepting new riders. We left USJ at 20:00 sharp, feeling knackered after spending more than 12 hours here!

# The Damage

In total, this entire trip costed us JPY 90,850 for 2 adults, which included the following:

* Studio Pass x2: JPY 21,800
* Express Pass 7 x2: JPY 51,600
* Power-up Band: JPY 4,900
* Food and drinks: JPY 7,350
* Souvenirs: JPY 5,200

# The Conclusion

We set out to make this a once-in-a-lifetime trip and we achieved it. We took our time to bask in the atmosphere and browse for souvenirs without having to rush between rides. We managed to take all the major rides and enjoyed most of the park, despite being quite inefficient with our time. All these despite visiting USJ at purportedly the worst possible time of the year.

In hindsight, Express Pass 7 was an overkill. Our strategy would have allowed us to finish all the rides outside of SNW and Hogsmeade via the normal queue with plenty of time to spare (and probably time for us to repeat the rides several times). The greatest value in purchasing the Express Pass 7 was buying a peace of mind, allowing us to focus on enjoying the moment instead.

If we had to choose again, we would have opted for any Express Pass 4 offering guaranteed access to SNW, Bowser’s Challenge, and Mine Cart Madness, as these 2 rides were practically impossible otherwise unless you are willing to deal with the stress of the rope-drop strategy or to queue up to 2 hours for each ride, either of which would compromise your ability to complete other rides that the park has to offer. For those who are willing to forgo the 2 rides, it would be perfectly fine to skip the express passes entirely as long as you keep your eye out for timed SNW entry tickets.

We were happy with our decision to buy a power-up band and forgo the wand. The band unlocks access to additional minigames, Bowser Jr Shadow Showdown, and interactive sceneries around SNW that felt like good value overall money (Boo to supporting DLC though!). The few other minor benefits that come along with the band may help to sweeten the deal for some.

The food and drinks were expectedly expensive and average. Security was pretty lax with the food that we brought and we probably could’ve gotten away with smuggling in enough food to last us the day if we wanted. Perhaps we got lucky? YMMV.

Lastly, I would like to end off with my utmost respect I have for all the staff at USJ. They were all incredibly friendly and helpful. I have no idea how they keep up their enthusiasm throughout the day. They help to inject so much life and joy into the park. Kudos to them!

This wraps up my experience of USJ during Golden Week. Based on my experience, don’t be deterred from visiting USJ just because it’s Golden Week. For those on a budget, don’t feel pressured to buy an Express Pass 7. Think about which attractions that are important to you, and pick and choose accordingly, or forgo it entirely. I hope this help some of you in planning for your own trip. Enjoy!",1,1748718032.0,usj,0,1.0,False
1l04qyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/7daystodie/comments/1l04qyf/honestly_the_worst_part_of_magazines_isnt_the_rng/,Honestly the worst part of magazines isn't the RNG skill progression to me.  It's how dumb it makes loot.,"I fully get the hate for magazines bottlenecking progression through RNG drops.  But I can honestly work around that grind.  The thing that irritates me the most is that it makes loot total nonsense in a game that already didn't make sense concerning loot type spawns.

Liquor piles, soda machines and even coffee machines will nearly always just contain murky water, and I'm level 300 in my current run, maxed out on every perk.  Loot stage is about is high as it's going to get.  Even in the later biomes, anything that contain a drinkable item will usually be murky water.  Finding any of the booze other than beer almost never happens, and I don't think I've ever seen the spring water in loot, or even the vending machines that have that water on the front of the machine.  I feel like it should spawn as loot, but it doesn't.  Maybe it's not supposed to.

Food piles will often just be a couple corn meal, an old sham sandwich and a couple food magazines.  Even Shamway crates will often have just that level of loot in them.  

All shelves and cabinets have the exact same loot table, which also makes no sense to me.  A cabinet in an office in a military compound will have the same loot as a kitchen cabinet, which is to say food magazines and maybe a potato.  Shelves in a grocery store and shelves in a hardware store shouldn't have the same loot on them, especially when that loot is things that look like they belong in a farming supply store.  Why are there dirt and seeds on a shelf in an electronics store?

I get the short term benefit of having all loot target what your build is at the lower levels, but it makes no sense, and cuts you off from being able to make smart choices.  Like if I'm building a character that currently has no farming perks, going into a POI that would reasonably have things like seeds *should* allow me to target that POI to get things outside of my build that I would still need.  Instead, it's going to provide me with loot based on my build, no matter how little sense it makes.",15,1748718017.0,7daystodie,4,0.83,False

Most of my birthdays were spent at home alone and unfortunately tomorrow wont be any difference. The sad thing is after years of my now ex partner being the only person to celebrate it, they wont be with me. We were long distance for 3 years and this year was meant to be my first birthday spent together. I had moved interstate to be close to them and a week after i moved they left me.

I cant help but cry like a little kid thinking about it and im miserable. The day constantly felt like a reminder of how unimportant i am and tomorrow especially emphasises that. I try hard to celebrate the birthdays of people i care about, staying up till 12am to be the first to celebrate or even surpising my ex at their doorstep for their 18th.

I want to be loved so badly and i try but i still find myself sitting alone in my room on the day.

I’m sure this is asked a billion times per day, but I was getting overwhelmed reading on the reads and still can’t make a good decision. 

I am a huge espresso fan. I like my lattes and macchiatos from coffee shops. I have made some at home with low end machines and once had a ninja coffee bar- it almost always tastes watery or burnt, unsurprisingly. I recently moved to a rural area and I travel a lot for work, so I’m already spending money on the shops when I’m driving. I would really like to get a good system for days when I’m actually home at my place In the countryside so I don’t need to drive a half hour for a latte. It would be nice to chill at home for a day or two but I really don’t feel complete without my daily latte. 

My sister has the delonghi 3630 that I got for her for Christmas and she loves it. She has a cheap grinder and and a timer and makes pretty good lattes at home. She also uses local farm whole milk. I was thinking about getting this delonghi for myself, but most of the posts I’m seeing are actually about the grinding. My sister gave me a giant like 5 pound bag of whole espresso beans when I visited her (Kirkland brand) and I have no clue what to do with it. I don’t know much about grinding beans but I enjoy doing it when I have attempted it before. We grew up with a manual hand-crank grinder. 

I just want to make a good tasting latte or mocha. I’m not super picky. Advice on doing this, what to buy, storage, etc is welcome. I do have the option to have my favorite coffee shop grind their espresso for me and just take it home once per week as well if the grinder is too expensive. Would like to spend under $300 for everything. Thanks!

1l04lh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalHealthFinds/comments/1l04lh5/this_zero_sugar_hydration_supplement_helped_more/,This zero sugar hydration supplement helped more than any energy drink or magnesium pill,"I was skeptical when I first heard about **Seaonic**. I’ve tried my fair share of **electrolyte supplements**, hydration powders, and sports drinks over the years. Most of them are packed with sweeteners, flavorings, or ingredients I can’t even pronounce. I assumed Seaonic was more of the same until I realized it wasn’t trying to be a sports drink at all.

This post is for anyone who's **tried “healthy” supplements** and still feels drained, foggy, or off balance. That was me too. I’m not an athlete. I’m not keto. I just wanted my brain to work and my body to stop crashing every afternoon. Seaonic helped in a way I didn’t expect.

**Why I gave it a try (again)**

I work from home and spend most of my day staring at screens. By 2 p.m., my brain would feel like mush sluggish thinking, low motivation, and the kind of tired where even coffee didn’t help. A friend mentioned **Seaonic**, calling it “hydration without the nonsense.” No sugar, no fizz, no flavor. Just **pure ocean minerals**.

At first I brushed it off. But after reading how our filtered water and over-farmed soil strip away the minerals we need for **cellular hydration**, I started thinking maybe water alone wasn’t enough. Turns out, **our bodies can’t absorb water properly without electrolytes and trace minerals**. And that’s what Seaonic delivers **78 ionic minerals**, naturally occurring, already in liquid form.

**What surprised me most**

The sachets are tiny. You don’t need to mix them into 16oz of water. Just tear and drink. Tastes like seawater salty, nothing more. At first it felt odd. But after three days, I noticed I wasn’t crashing mid-afternoon anymore. It didn’t feel like a stimulant; it felt like my brain was finally working like it should.

By the end of week one, I realized I was:

* Drinking less water but feeling more hydrated
* Thinking more clearly during the day
* Sleeping deeper without melatonin or magnesium

I didn’t expect it to impact my sleep, but it absolutely did.

**What I like about Seaonic (and what I don’t)**

**What I like:**

* **It’s clean.** One ingredient: cold-microfiltered seawater.
* **No prep.** You don’t have to stir, shake, or chug.
* **No sugar, no flavor, no fluff.** It’s real hydration not disguised as a fruit punch.
* **It’s actually bioavailable.** These minerals are in ionic form, meaning your body doesn’t have to break anything down.

**What I don’t like:**

* The saltiness takes getting used to.
* It’s not cheap but for me, it replaced multiple products I was trying (electrolytes, magnesium, trace minerals, and hydration boosters).
* You have to use it consistently to notice the benefits. It’s subtle, not dramatic.

**Who this could help**

You don’t need to be running marathons to benefit from Seaonic. Based on my experience and others I’ve read:

* People with **mental fatigue or burnout**
* Those prone to **dehydration**, especially in dry climates
* Anyone who uses filtered water (which removes minerals)
* Women dealing with **bloating, headaches, or hormone imbalance**
* People recovering from illness or low energy periods

This isn’t some flavored sports drink with caffeine and B12. It’s closer to **cellular nutrition**. It helps your body absorb water, balance electrolytes, and get rid of waste.

**How it’s different from other electrolytes**

Most **electrolyte drinks** contain 5–10 minerals at most and they’re often synthetic. Seaonic has **78 trace elements** in ratios that mimic your blood plasma. There’s no guesswork about dosage, no measuring or mixing. Just one sachet and done.

And since it’s **cold-filtered** through a 0.22 micron process, there are **no heavy metals, microplastics, or additives**. It’s the only one I’ve found that doesn’t leave me bloated or wired.

**If you’re curious, here’s where I learned more**:  
[**Seaonic Official Site**](https://seaonic.com/?lpid=1066&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1066&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1066&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1066&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalHealthFinds)

And if you’re into the nerdy side like I am, this page explains the **science behind the cellular hydration benefits**:  
[**Seaonic Scientific Overview**](https://seaonic.com/pages/wds-se-lp?lpid=2574&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1066&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1066&device_type=&country_name=&uid=2574&oid=1066&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalHealthFinds)

I’m not saying it’s for everyone. But if you’ve tried the usual stuff hydration powders, B vitamins, magnesium blends and you’re still feeling off, Seaonic might be worth looking into. It definitely changed how I think about hydration.

Just wanted to say a big thank you to everyone who responded to my earlier post about things to do in Hamburg (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAGerman/comments/1krna7p/first\_time\_in\_hamburg\_this\_june\_vegetarian/). Your suggestions were incredibly helpful and made planning so much easier.

On my way back, I’ve managed to squeeze in a 24-hour layover in Munich. I don’t have a packed list—just hoping to visit the White Rose memorial. Apart from that, I’d love to see anything related to history, art, or architecture. I’m vegetarian (eggs are okay) and always up for trying good local pastries or coffee.

If you have any ideas for things to do with limited time, I’d really appreciate it. Also, since this is my first time in Munich, any “don’t do this” tips so I can avoid making an unintentional cultural mistake would be very welcome.

Thanks again to all the wonderful folks here—you’ve been amazing!",1,1748717510.0,AskAGerman,3,0.67,False

This is my first post here. Hopefully there is someone who can support me with my weird problem. So I bought a Lelit Victoria used but in very good condition in its original packaging and with all original accessories. Pulling my first with it made me realizing that the direction of the portafilter is sidewards and not to the front. So I searched for pictures of the portafilter and normally the spouts show to the front (so you can put 2 cups next to each other). I tried removing the spouts a few times to see if there are different possibilities to attach it to the portafilter but that doesn’t seem to be the case. I haven’t seen anyone with this problem online so hopefully I will find some advice. Maybe I will post my upgraded coffee station here when I fixed that issue.

Like, some people are DESPERATE to be their friend and it’s so obvious. If an “ugly” or even average person was new on the scene, they wouldn’t care at all. Like at my old job, a gorgeous woman from England started working at my job in Texas and people were inviting her out for drinks on day one and showing up to work with little trinkets, cheap gifts and coffee for her every week trying to win her over lmao. Not hitting on her, it was all married women doing this to another married woman. They didn’t do this for me or any other average woman who was new there.

I can’t be the only one who sees this and thinks it’s kind of pathetic and sad? If I said this to anyone else I’d be perceived as “jealous” when I’m not. I know im ugly, but I don’t care that other people are better looking than I am or have an easier time making friends. Sure, socializing is harder for me. But I’m not desperate for friendship and never have been, and I don’t care how attractive a perspective new friend is. I want to make friends with people I know have similar interests and are GOOD people on the inside.

TLDR: attractive people bring out desperation and patheticness in others

Setting:

Modern-day India, in a slightly chaotic private school in a tier-2 city (like Pune, Indore, or Kochi). The school’s trying to act ""modern"" but still runs like it’s stuck in 1995.

Main Characters:

Mr. Neelakantan ""Newton"" Iyer – Early 40s. Physics teacher with a razor-sharp tongue. Cynical, witty, and popular among bored students. Lives alone, lives for filter coffee.

Tina D'Souza – 17, top ranker and class monitor. Was forced to join the science club for ""character building."" Always carries a file and a complaint.

Jignesh “Jiggy” Patel – 16, the joker of the class. Known for his viral prank videos and failed jugaad inventions.

Mehak Singh – 15, robotics nerd with a deadpan sense of humor. Loves Bollywood conspiracy theories.

Principal Renu Arora – 50s, obsessed with discipline and “presentability.” Thinks Newton Sir is a bad influence.

PT Master Suresh “Suru” – Also handles yoga, art, and morning assembly when needed. Always accidentally gets involved in science club chaos.



---

Tone & Style:

Silly, warm, and rapid-fire. Like a mix of Kota Factory, Chhichhore, and Mind Your Language, with plenty of Desi references, family pressure jokes, and student antics.

A tired old fan creaks overhead. The walls are covered with faded charts of Newton’s Laws and random science fair posters.

MR. NEELAKANTAN “NEWTON” IYER (40s), with disheveled hair, black coffee in hand, leans against the desk.

He looks at a class of half-awake students. One is sleeping using a math book as a pillow. Another is sneakily eating mixture.

NEWTON SIR
(Deadpan)
Newton's First Law: A student in motion stays in motion... unless it’s before 8:30 am, then they don’t move at all.

I'm excited to share that Lovecraft's leading scholar, S. T. Joshi, had graciously taken time out of his busy schedule to answer a few questions about Lovecraft's life and character, and address some common myths. Throughout the internet, from forums to media comments to professional ""journalistic"" articles, you'll find the same lies repeated again and again, portraying Lovecraft as a lonely, paranoid, hate-filled freak who could barely muster the strength to leave his own home. And sometimes these myths come with a distinct whiff of what some might call prejudice against neurodivergent people. But Mr. Joshi is here to dispel these myths.

I hope this post can be linked wherever and to whomever it’s necessary. Intellectual honesty depends on acknowledging truth, not sensational stories.

_

1) Is it true that Lovecraft was a shut-in for most of his life?

S. T.:

This is hardly the case. As an adolescent, he had numerous friends in his neighbourhood with whom he played all manner of games—from being a detective to playing in a band, and so on. When he joined the amateur journalism movement in 1914, he regularly attended conventions and more informal gatherings of amateur writers in Boston and elsewhere; many amateurs came to visit him in Providence. During his New York years (1924-26) he was particularly gregarious, as his “Kalem Club” met at each other’s residences once a week (and Lovecraft was delighted to host such gatherings, bringing out his fine china and even buying an aluminum pail so that he could fetch coffee from a nearby deli). Indeed, at one point he felt he was consuming so much time being out with “the boys” that he deliberately restricted his outings so that he could get some work done. During the last ten years of his life, after returning to Providence in 1926, he not only engaged in wide-ranging travels up and down the East Coast (from as far north as Quebec and as far south as Key West, and including New Orleans, Charleston, Richmond, Philadelphia, and numerous other sites), but would often visit friends and colleagues in these locales. It is ridiculous even to use the term “shut-in” for Lovecraft—it is an antipodally erroneous designation.

2) Is it true that Lovecraft's aunts were domineering and crippled his personal growth?

S. T.:

Lovecraft may well have felt a certain sense of domination from his mother, but after she passed away in 1921, he entered into willing cohabitation with his aunts, and they were mutually supportive of each other and left each other with the freedom to pursue their own interests and their own schedules. And, in an interesting reversal from his childhood, during the last decade of his life it was Lovecraft who became his aunts’ caretaker—first Lillian Clark, and then (after Lillian passed away in 1932), Annie Gamwell. Both suffered ill-health during their final years, and Lovecraft exercised a touching devotion to them and a genuine interest in their welfare. But they recognised that he was an adult, and left him free to lead his life as he wished.

3) Is it true that Lovecraft had no friends outside of his correspondents?

S. T.:

Throughout his life, Lovecraft sought for intellectual equals with whom he could discuss vital issues in philosophy, science, literature, and other subjects; it is understandable that a city like Providence—which, aside from Brown University, is not known as a centre of intellectual enquiry—would provide few such people. But he went out of his way to cultivate an acquaintance with such individuals as C. M. and Muriel Eddy, going so far as to give Eddy one of his suits when Eddy was particularly hard up for cash. As I’ve said, in New York he was the life of the party during the Kalem Club meetings. But there is no reason to deprecate the relative lack of personal friendships in the places where he lived. Most of us today associate with people outside of our personal locales, and we are surely the gainers thereby in terms of intellectual and aesthetic stimulation.

4) And finally, is it true that he was depressed for most of his life? I understand he had periods of melancholy, but was he largely depressed as a person?

S. T.: 

There were probably only two times in his life that Lovecraft was seriously depressed: first, in 1904, when he was forced to move out of his birthplace (454 Angell Street) after the death of his grandfather; and second, in 1925–26, when the experience of living in New York, living alone in a city he had come to loathe and without effective means of support, caused some suicidal ideation. But for the rest of his life he was relatively cheerful and found enormous stimulation from intellectual, aesthetic, and antiquarian pursuits. To be sure, he had very little money, but he regarded the task of getting by on his modest income as a sort of game; money never meant much to him in any case. Certainly, he refused to prostitute his art just to make a sale to the pulp magazines. Lovecraft in fact led pretty much the life he wanted to lead—a life devoted to literature and the life of the mind. He found a great many things to engage his interest—and one of his least-known qualities (although it was one that his friends knew well) was his dry and understated sense of humour.

S. T.:

Let me add a few general remarks about the deliberate misconstruals of Lovecraft’s life and personality that appear to be prevalent on the internet and social media. It appears that certain people are so incensed by Lovecraft’s racism (even though this genuine flaw in his character was a far more nuanced stance than most people realise) that they are looking for any excuse to denigrate him further. It is highly peculiar—and paradoxical—that such criticisms derive chiefly from purportedly liberal voices, who otherwise claim to be devoted to “difference” and “diversity.” Apparently there is no toleration for Lovecraft’s difference from “normal” individuals, even though his high intellect alone would make him (as it has made most people of great accomplishment) very different from the average person. Some people just can’t wrap their minds around the fact that a racist (even in an age when a great majority of people—including many in the intelligentsia—were racists) could be considered by many a decent person. One friend wrote that Lovecraft was “a man of such engaging parts and accomplishments as to win the esteem and affection of all who knew him. . . . He remains enshrined in my memory as a great gentleman, in the truest sense of that much abused term.”",17,1748716994.0,Lovecraft,4,1.0,False

The soup was handed to me in a Starbucks-type coffee cup with a lid, and I was instructed to drink it (I had been drinking broth recently because of a medical diet). When this mystery cup was given to me, I was curious, so I opened the lid to see what was inside. Apparently, this was the wrong decision—she became very upset and said that me opening the cup meant I didn’t trust her. It became a big issue. I didn’t understand how opening a cup to see what’s inside equates to not trusting her, but that’s how she took it. I became a little irritated myself and went for a walk. Some time later, she found me outside. We talked for a bit, and that was the end of that.

Fast forward three days, and we’re sitting on the couch watching a TV show together, laughing and talking as usual. We finished the final episode around 2 a.m., and it was time for bed. She said she was going to take a shower, and I said, “Okay, I’ll go wash the dishes and clean the kitchen a bit while you shower.” Time passed, I finished the dishes, and I walked into the bathroom. By this time, it was about 2:30 a.m. When I walked in, she was naked, bent over the bed on TikTok, ""air-drying,"" which she usually does after a shower, so I didn’t think anything of it. I went into the bathroom, brushed my teeth, and did everything I usually do before bed. I was really exhausted at this point, so I walked out, went to my side of the bed, and got changed for sleep.

Apparently, this was the wrong decision again.

She was still in the same position on the bed air-drying, and I started noticing she was giving me sharp, angry glances. I asked, “What happened?” and she told me I didn’t slap her butt as I passed by, and that became an issue. She completely shut down and stayed in that position on the bed, doom-scrolling TikTok, and the atmosphere became really awkward. A couple of minutes passed with no words exchanged, and she eventually got up and started getting dressed for bed. While doing so, there were a lot of heavy sighs and sniffling.

Now, I’ll admit that I’m not the most emotionally intelligent person, so I just lay there trying to figure out what was going on and how I was supposed to respond. After she finally got into bed, I tried to start a light conversation like we usually do before falling asleep. But this time, her responses were short, with lots of “I don’t know,” heavy sighs, and continued sniffling.

By now it was around 3 a.m., and I was still exhausted. I gave her a kiss goodnight like I always do and said goodnight. Normally it only takes me about five minutes to fall asleep—I'm usually out before she is—but this time I decided to stay awake and wait for her to fall asleep first, since I could tell she was feeling down. But every time I asked what was wrong, she shut me down and said, “It’s fine,” which I’ve come to understand means “I’m upset but I’m not going to tell you why.” At that point, I was just lost on what to do. I ended up just lying there. There were lots of back-and-forths with her telling me to go to sleep and me saying I was waiting for her to fall asleep first. I think I finally fell asleep around 5 a.m.

That was last night, and I’m writing this the morning after.

So I’m kind of at a loss here. I feel like she has scenarios in her head, and if I don’t play them out according to a script, it becomes a problem. The only thing is—I don’t have the script. I’m just moving through these situations blindly, and honestly, it’s exhausting always trying to figure out what I’m supposed to do next to avoid stepping on a landmine.

But the  amount of information overwhelmed me a bit as a beginner so I wanted to ask a few questions to people who’ve been making incense  as a profession or as a hobby.

I would like to start with obtaining a grinder. I know blendtec is the best grinder for non-industrial purposes but those machines seem to be quite expensive. Before I make that kind of investment in this hobby, is there a cheaper, more acceptable option? Can I use a manual coffee grinder, or maybe one of the cheaper electric coffee grinders? 

Binders: Makko powder isn’t sold in Turkey. Tragacanth gum is often recommended as an alternate binder, but I found that it’s not really a good binder (already made a few batches) and it also smells a bit bitter. Someone recommended honey and it does seem like a good alternative but again, would it make the incense smell too sweet? Any alternate binders you can recommend? Also any tips to bind the blends welcome (how much water if any should I add, etc)

Combustibles: is sawdust a good enough combustible? In a book I read saltpeter was recommended -  but it sounds hard to obtain and kind of dangerous to experiment with. Any easy to procure, safe and good combustibles I can use?

My first batches just smelled like things burning, and the cones didn’t burn all the way through - I made them dried lavender, cinnamon, sandalwood dust and a mix of all three. I just want to successfully make an incense that burns all the way and smells like the things I made it with so that I can get excited and motivated. I can work out the kinks later.

I’d also appreciate any other tip about incense making. Thanks in advance! ",1,1748716034.0,Incense,0,1.0,False

Paid Work App: Turning Your Free Time into Extra Cash

What’s the Paid Work App All About?

Think of it as a super-flexible side hustle in your pocket.

It’s designed for anyone who wants to make a bit of extra cash without a big time commitment.

What Makes It Worth a Try?

✅ Tons of Tasks – You’re not stuck doing the same thing over and over. There’s a wide range of activities to choose from, so it’s easy to find something that actually interests you.

✅ Super Simple to Use – You don’t need to be a tech expert. The app is easy to navigate, and everything is laid out in a way that just makes sense.

✅ Fast Payouts – Once you hit the minimum payout threshold, you can get your earnings transferred to your bank or e-wallet pretty quickly.

✅ No Upfront Costs – It’s free to join and start using, so you don’t have to worry about paying to play.

How to Jump In

Getting started is a breeze:

I was hiking recently and kept finding interesting rocks but had no idea what they were. I got tired of Googling and built a simple app to solve this problem.

The video shows it in action - snap a photo and get instant geological details powered by Google's Gemini API. The multimodal AI analyzes visual characteristics while pulling from its knowledge base, which honestly works way better than I expected.

I built it using native iOS (Swift/SwiftUI) and optimized it for quick responses (under 3 seconds). I also programmed it to roast you if you try to identify something that's not a rock (e.g., your coffee mug!)

For monetization, users receive five free premium identifications to try it risk-free. Users can then sign up for a weekly (which further comes with a 3-day free trial) or annual subscription.

The app is currently under review. I will post the link here once it is published (hopefully soon!). I would love to gather initial thoughts and feedback from the community on iOS app development best practices.

I have one friend, but we don’t see each other very often – she lives a bit far away and we both work. Over the years, I’ve generally had a hard time keeping in touch with people. It’s not because I don’t want to, but more because I’m afraid of being a burden or that people don’t actually want to spend time with me.

I’m pretty quiet when you first meet me – it takes time for me to feel comfortable around others. I think I often come across as a bit boring at first, until I relax and can be myself.

The friend I have now is someone I got to know during my studies. She reaches out often – and so do I – mainly because with her, I don’t feel like I’m being a burden.

Otherwise, I rarely reach out to people, because I worry it might make them uncomfortable. I honestly don’t know how to maintain contact without feeling like I’m bothering someone. I often think that if people really wanted to hang out with me, they would’ve gotten in touch – so I usually avoid being the one to make the first move. I know that’s not the right mindset, because the other person might be thinking the same thing.

For example, during my education I had an internship where I met another girl who was also interning there that same week. We got along really well and had a great time together. She asked for my number and we exchanged contact info. But we never stayed in touch, and now it’s been about 7–8 months. Would it be weird to reach out now and ask if she wants to grab a coffee? I honestly think we could’ve become good friends.

I know I should have figured this stuff out by now, but I just haven’t. How do you stay in touch with people you’ve clicked with? And is it okay to reach out after such a long time?

Trevor hadn't had any luck running the border, though that smell stuck with him, even eight hours later as he helped hang drywall at the job site. On his lunch break, he sat in his truck and rolled himself a cigarette, letting his mind wander back to the first night that they had discovered the dead animal. He ate quickly after finishing his smoke, drinking coffee from his thermos until it was time to get back to work. The recent events had left him feeling uneasy, as they probably should have, but he couldn't let himself get too off-balance.

He had to hold it together for the three kids that he had been helping, if not for the rest of his family. When his work day ended, he drove to the small, but tidy trailer that he lived in, tucked away on his older sister's property. His niece wasn't home from her sports practice yet, and his sister was gone as well. He walked into the main house, digging into the pantry and refrigerator to assemble himself a sandwich before he walked back out to the smaller, mobile structure that he called home to eat. He returned to the house to shower and change his clothes.

When he had dressed and stepped out of the bathroom, Trevor found that the two women had returned, the younger peering around the corner, breaking toward him at full speed to wrap her arms around his mid-section.

“Hey, how was your day?” he asked, returning the embrace.

“It was good.” she replied simply, stepping back and turning to walk back toward the kitchen.

Trevor followed her into the other room, where his sister was frying hamburger in a pan, while dicing garlic and other things on the counter alongside the range, adding them in and stirring the mixture.



“How'd things go last night? Ready to admit you need my help yet?” she asked.



He rolled his eyes.



“We don't need your help, but thanks for the offer.” he snarked in return.



“Any time, little brother.” she shot back.



He opened the refrigerator and grabbed a bottle of beer from the lower rack, twisting the top off.



“I do wish I knew what was going on. Uncle Al seems determined to keep this thing quiet, but the way things are going...” he trailed off to take a sip of the drink in his hand. “I just don't know.”



“So, you do need my help, then?” she prodded at him.



He took a longer drink.



“Maybe.” he finally replied, then left the room as his sibling crowed victoriously



He walked back out to his trailer and spent some time tidying that up, waiting for the sun to set. He wasn't planning on visiting his aunt and uncle that night, but another idea had surfaced in his mind. He grabbed a small knapsack, throwing a few things into that, carrying the bag out to his car to toss it in the back seat. As dusk touched the sky, he got behind the wheel and started up the engine. He drove back out toward his aunt and uncle's property, turning off of the main road onto a narrower, unpaved track.



He followed that past the point where the fence line to the family property stopped, and then a few miles more. He pulled off to the side of the dirt road as the sky began to darken further, grabbing the kit he had assembled. Once out in the open desert, he started to walk, sniffing at the air rapidly. At first he only detected the things that he would expect. Wildlife, flowers, oil and exhaust. There. Just underneath it all, the sour of decaying lemon rinds. He focused in on that, opening the bag as he moved. Each time the odor got stronger, he tied a scrap of cloth around a bush or fence post.



He also extracted a small GPS device and noted each point. Once he was done there, he drove to the neighborhood where his niece and nephew's friends lived. He didn't approach their houses, but noticed the reek in the area almost immediately. He followed that out into the desert again, marking the border, finally coming back around in a rough circle. He also marked the cooridinates again, transferring those into a small notebook that he pulled from the bag along with a pen. Once he finished that he packed the little book away and started back home.



As he drove back toward the main road there was a flash of movement just outside of the range of his headlights. He slammed on his brakes immediately. The thing moved in the gloom just ahead and to the left of his vehicle. At first he moved to open the door. That's when something heavy collided with the rear of the car hard enough for it shudder on the tires and jerk forward even though the brake pedal was to the floor. His hand jerked back, eyes shifting quickly to the rear view mirror. He saw a gray, twisted shape in his tail lights, though it was facing away and running the other direction.



His heart hammered hard in his chest and he moved his gaze to the creature in front of him. It had disappeared into the gloom even as a slow fog began to creep in. The car shuddered again, and this time, the feeling of being frozen in place broke. His foot shifted to the gas pedal, and he pressed that down hard. The tires spun in the dirt before finding purchase and the vehicle lurched forward. He didn't slow down until he got back to the main road, only doing so to avoid getting pulled over. He pulled into the driveway almost a half hour after the encounter, and jogged into the house.

Both his kindred were in other parts of the house, but that was fine, for the moment. Trevor's focus was on the telephone, which he lifted from the charger base. He dialed the number to his aunt and uncle's house, waiting as it rang a handful of times before the male half of the twins answered.

“Hello?” Joshua said, sounding out of breath and a little rushed.

“Hey, is everything okay?” he asked.

“I'm not sure. Something is going on outside. Mom and dad took the ATVs.” the younger male replied.

“Do you want me to come out there?” Trevor offered.

“I don't think so. I will have my dad calls you when he gets back.” the boy said, and then hung up.

Trevor stared at the device in his hand and then pressed the button that powered it off and set it back into the cradle to charge. The thought of getting back in the car and driving back to his uncle's place crossed his mind, but he didn't. Instead he turned on the flatscreen mounted on the wall, and flopped down onto the couch, waiting for the phone to ring. It took nearly an hour before that happened, and he snatched it up quickly, pressing the power button again.

“Hey, what's going on?” he asked before even confirming who was on the other end of the line.

“Nothing. It was just a false alarm.” the older man said.

“It sounded like more than that. What happened?” Trevor asked, not quite believing his uncle's explanation.

“Those things were near the fence, but we couldn't find them. Whatever they are, they move fast.” he said.

“I saw them out on the road to the quarry tonight. One of them attacked my car.” the younger man interjected.

“Do you know what they are?” his uncle's voice changed during the sentence, growing quieter and tenser.

“No. They look... It's hard to describe. Maybe I can draw the one that attacked my car.” he offered.

“Try to do so. Come over after work tomorrow.” his uncle told him and then hung up.

'At least I know where Josh gets it from.' he mused, replacing the phone in the cradle.

Trevor stood and made his way back out to his trailer, that sour odor still faintly present on the wind, but no stronger than it had been before. He walked into his home and opened a cabinet, extracting a bottle of vodka from inside, pouring some into a glass to mix with cola. He took a long drink after stirring it with a long plastic stick. The alcohol burned its way down his throat and into his stomach. He sat at the small table and grabbed his pencils and small sketchbook, trying to accurately capture what he had seen in the tail lights of his car. He swiped the first page away and crumpled it, and then tried again.

This time it looked closer to the creature on the road and satisfied, he made himself another drink and set his alarm for the morning, tucking himself into bed. He fell asleep easily, thanks to the slight buzz he had cultivated for himself. He woke to his alarm without feeling any after effects from the vodka he had swallowed the night before. He got dressed in clean clothes and forced himself to eat breakfast before leaving the house, carrying the sketchbook and pencil. He arrived at the job site earlier than most of the crew, and as such he found somewhere to sit, trying to improve on his drawing.

He did a little bit more detailing on his breaks and lunch, and by the end of the day he was satisfied with it. He drove back over to the property his kin owned quickly, and found a large portion of food set on the table for him, as well as the others. They engaged in light small talk between bites of food and long drinks of their chosen beverages. Once they had finished, and the teenagers were occupied with washing and drying the dishes, Trevor stood and went out to his car to grab the hardcover book, pausing as he neared the front steps.

That odor was stronger. Fresher. It almost burned the back of his throat and brought tears to his eyes. He stared out into the darkness, letting his eyes roll over the landscape slowly. He could see nothing moving out there however, so he continued back inside. He didn't mention the scent outside, but he did open the cover of his sketchbook, showing the drawing to his family.

“What the hell are they?” he asked, eyes on the elder man's face..

“I can't tell you just from this. But at least I know where to look.” his uncle said, ripping the page from the book.

At first Trevor felt a flash of irritation. Then curiosity won out.

“Where are you going?” he asked.

“To your dad's place. You want to come along?” Al asked in return.

He nodded and stood, the older man grabbing the keys from the hook by the door as they stepped outside. He paused, just as his nephew had done when the sour smell invaded his nostrils. They both got into the old truck that Al used as an every day driver and started out of the long driveway. Trevor reached under the passenger seat to grip the handle of the revolver stashed away there. His eyes scanned the darkening road as his uncle turned onto the main track. They didn't see anything on the way, and he relaxed and released the grip of the pistol as they made the turn onto the small road that would lead them to his childhood home.

The place was in better shape than it had been back then, his father having used some of his military pension to refurbish the place. Everything was new, from the paint to the carpet, and when he stepped inside, as it often did, it seemed surreal. The layout was the same, but the cracks in the ceiling and walls had all been filled in and painted over. He walked up the stairs and through the doorway into what had been his room. The old bed and his posters were long gone, replaced by cartons of old clothing, books and photo albums.

He grabbed one heavy box, carrying it down the stairs, his uncle doing the same from the basement with the help of Trevor's father. Al showed him the drawing that Trevor had made while the youngest of the trio began pulling books out in small stacks. He placed those on the table and Jasper looked at his son with a slight smile.

“I thought you took art classes.” his father jabbed.

“Almost ten years ago, pops.” he sighed back.

The two older men chuckled, and then they all began to crack the books and scan the various drawings and descriptions of creatures both living and extinct, and even those that most of the world considered a myth. Jasper left them to it around two in the morning. Their searching proved futile however and they returned to the trailer feeling defeated. The faint, sour smell still hung in the air, and even seemed to be getting stronger at this point. Al motioned for Trevor to continue inside, moving down toward the sweat lodge alone, following the trail as it got stronger.

He couldn't see anything in the deep darkness around him but he felt eyes on him, seemingly from every direction. A chill rolled along his spine and small bumps raised on the backs of his arms. He turned and walked back toward the house, pausing to look back to make sure nothing was jumping over the fence to come after him. There was nothing but darkness and his imagination, and Al hurried the rest of the way inside. Trevor left shortly later. He returned to his own home, barely tucking himself into bed before dawn.

At least he was able to sleep in the next day, waking shortly before the stroke of noon. He didn't bother to eat, making his way off of the reservation and onto the major highway, heading West. He stopped between population centers and found a place away from prying eyes occasionally, sniffing the wind deeply, not surprised to find that sour odor lingering in the air, though it was clearly starting to fade away. He stopped for gas and to get something to eat once he got into the valley, and then continued toward the coastline.

As he got closer, that odor got more intense once again, and he squinted into the trees at the small rest area but of course saw nothing suspicious. He got back into the car and drove until he got to the small town of Siletz. He found the only motel in town and checked into a room. He planned to head to the reservation in the morning, but sleep came first.

He didn't hear the thing sniffing around his window.",1,1748715606.0,u_OutlawWriter,0,1.0,False

1l03tja,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockOptionCoffeeShop/comments/1l03tja/an_alternate_take_on_pmccs/,An Alternate Take On PMCCs,"I recently wrote a post about some [disadvantages of LEAPS](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockOptionCoffeeShop/comments/1kxje4m/leaps_some_disadvantages/), and in this post, I will address how I’m switching gears in how I approach LEAPS in order to minimize the risk of early assignment.

In the past I would sell calls against my LEAPS by being conservative in delta selection, often around a delta of about -0.15 to -0.10. Given the stocks I tend to invest in, that still wasn’t enough to keep the short call out of serious risk of early assignment. In addition, due to the low delta, the premiums were relatively low.

**TLDR**

Selling a far dated call can substantially reduce the risk of early assignment while maintaining strong potential profitability.

**New Approach**

The new approach is simple, to wit, simply

* Sell a far dated call

This week I bought some PLTR LEAPS calls expiring June 18, 2026 with a strike of $80 (delta 0.868) for $57.04/share, and simultaneously sold calls expiring the same expiration date with a strike of $190 (delta -0.44) for $16.86/share (net cost of $40.18). This is, of course, a simple “Bull Call Spread” (I’m not fond of that terminology) or a “Debit Call Spread”.

Another way to look at it is that it reduces the breakeven (at expiration) from $137.04 ($80 strike plus $57.04 long call premium) to $120.18 (the $80 strike plus the net cost of the long and short calls of $40.18). PLTR closed at $131.78 on Friday.

**How This Structure Significantly Reduces the Possibility of Early Assignment**

1. The short strike is currently above (well above, at 44%) the current spot ($190 v $132).
2. As long as that holds true, the entire premium is extrinsic value.
3. As the stock price goes up, the value of that short call will also increase (again, meaning extrinsic value is actually increasing) to the extent that the price increase offsets the theta burn, and theta has a slow rate of burn before (especially) the last six months.
4. A standard approach to rolling LEAPS long calls is to do so at around six months remaining as that’s when theta burn starts to pick up (still pretty slowly), so I plan to do something similar. This means that there is little possibility of the short call going in the money by the time I roll the long call. When I roll the long call, I’ll simultaneously roll the short call. So, for example, in December 2025 I would roll the June 2026 structure to December 26.
5. Even if the spot of the underlying is above the short strike that early, there would still be a substantial extrinsic value. For example, if on December 2025 the stock price was $195 (a 48% increase in the next seven months), the value of the short call would be $37.79: $5 of intrinsic and $32.79 of extrinsic – nearly double the extrinsic when initially sold.

**Cost of Revised Approach**

I’m potentially giving up collecting more premium for selling the short calls (as I theoretically could collect more selling twelve monthlies versus one one-year expiration), but that’s okay. I’ve still collected about 12.5% of the spot in the short call premium. If the stock was at $190 at December 31, 2025, at that point in time the call spread would have a profit of about $37/share, a 92% return in six months ($37 profit on $40 net cost after short call premium). This compares with the stock’s increase of $190/$132 or 44%.

I say “theoretically” as, due to my delta selection when selling weeklies/monthlies, the premiums were on the lower side. For example, if I were to sell a 33 DTE call (expiring July 3, 2025) at a $165 strike (delta of -0.135) for $1.54/share. If I simply annualize that, I’d get $18.48; that compares with the $16.86 I actually collected.

As mentioned, an alternative way to look at it – the bearish side – is that the breakeven at December 31, 2025 of the structure I’ve entered is $119.27, so the stock could drop about $13 from its current $132, or about 10%, and I wouldn’t have lost any value. With just the long call, the breakeven at December 31, 2025 would be $132.27, allowing no room for a decline. If the stock dropped to $120, I’d have a loss of $1,050.

***To be clear:*** due to the low theta burn/high delta, the short call may be acting as a larger drag on the dollars of profit compared with the long call only depending on how fast the stock rises.

The following table shows the various contract values, profit amount, and profit percent, for various spot prices at December 31, 2025.

https://preview.redd.it/vzbgfgk2864f1.jpg?width=715&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5595ecb377b210423e2cb75d6643d2d3eff2e52

I’ve highlighted in yellow where the profit percentages are equal. As you can see, at a spot less than $185, the PMCC performs better, whereas above $185, the long call only performs better. This is a trade-off I’m not only willing to accept, but prefer: the stock doesn't have to rise as much to obtain higher profitability.

\[*Mental note to myself:* maybe this analysis will provide insight into when to roll the short call.\]

**Rolling at the Six Month Point**

A valid concern is the ease of which to roll up and out according to plan.

Since I didn’t start this last December, I’m going to use a reasonable approximation – I’ll select a strike that we’re fast approaching. Let’s say that last December I sold a $140 call expiring December 19, 2025. As of now, I could roll that out to a June 18, 2026 $190 call for a credit of $3.80/share. I’m okay with that.

**Summary**

* It is unlikely the stock will hit the short call strike in the six months prior to rolling.
* Even if it would, the extrinsic value would still be substantial.

Given these points, I see it the probability of early assignment during the six months the trade is open to be minimal.

I also see this as close to a “set it and forget it” strategy, which is not a bad thing in my opinion.

By selling a one-year to expiration short call you can still potentially get a great return with minimal (if any) risk of early assignment.

But after trying the **Terra Grounding Bed Sheet** for over 45 days, I have a much better answer. And, honestly, I think a lot of people might benefit from hearing what I’ve learned, especially if you deal with chronic pain, poor sleep, or that weird lingering exhaustion you can’t shake.

**So... what are grounding sheets, really?**

Grounding sheets (also called **earthing bed sheets**) are regular-looking bedsheets woven with conductive materials, usually silver threads. They plug into the grounding port of your home’s wall outlet (don’t worry, it’s the third hole and not electrically active), allowing your body to connect to the Earth’s natural electric charge while you sleep.

Sounds bizarre, right? That was my first reaction too. But I kept seeing posts on Reddit and articles about how **Terra therapy grounding sheets** were helping people sleep better and reduce inflammation. Eventually, I got curious enough to try them for myself.

**Why would anyone need to “ground” indoors?**

Turns out, walking barefoot outside connects your body to the Earth, which helps regulate natural electrical rhythms. But most of us live cut off from that - we wear shoes, live in high-rises, and sleep on mattresses with no connection to the ground. That’s where **earth grounding bed sheets** come in.

They simulate that connection while you sleep, for 6–8 hours a night. And according to a growing number of studies, that could actually improve sleep quality, reduce pain, and balance cortisol levels.

**The setup was ridiculously easy**

The **Terra grounding bed sheets** I bought came with a 15-foot cord and a little snap connector in the corner of the sheet. I snapped the cord into place, plugged the other end into my outlet, and that was it. I slept on top of it like I would any regular fitted sheet.

**Want to know exactly what I used? It was this one:** [**Terra Grounding Sheet**](https://terragrounding.co/pages/adv-doctor-v3/?lpid=2559&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1070&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1070&device_type=&country_name=&uid=2559&oid=1070&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/FiveStarBedding)

**Week 1: The “meh” phase**

Honestly, not much happened at first. I *wanted* to feel different, but I wasn’t sure. Maybe I was just hoping. Still, I noticed I was falling asleep faster and waking up less often. But I couldn’t say for sure it was the sheet.

**Week 2–3: Something started shifting**

By week three, my neck and shoulders weren’t nearly as tense in the morning. That might not sound major, but for me, it was the first time in years I wasn’t reaching for ibuprofen before coffee. My sleep felt more *restorative* \- less groggy, more ready.

That’s also when I noticed something interesting: I was waking up more alert. No more snoozing five times or dragging myself through the first hour of the day.

**Week 4+: Unexpected side effects (in a good way)**

I never bought the sheet expecting my mood to improve, but it kind of did. I was less irritable, had fewer random aches, and felt more in sync with my daily rhythm.

I even started tracking sleep metrics with my smartwatch. Deep sleep increased by about 15–20 minutes per night. Not life-changing, but measurable.

**Do grounding sheets work? My short answer: yes, for me**

I’m not here to sell you anything. Just sharing what happened. I know people on **grounding sheets Reddit** threads have mixed experiences, and some are still skeptical. That’s fair.

But as someone who’s tried everything from CBD to weighted blankets, this was the **only non-medication** change I’ve made that noticeably impacted my sleep and pain levels.

If you’re still wondering *do grounding sheets work*, I’d say: they might. Especially if you’re dealing with poor sleep, **inflammation**, or constant fatigue.

Here’s the exact **Terra grounding sheets review** I wish I’d read before buying:

**Final verdict: not hype, but not magic either**

These **grounding sheets for bed** won’t fix every problem in your life. But for me, they improved sleep, reduced discomfort, and helped me feel more rested. That’s more than most things I’ve tried.

Have you used **grounding sheets made in USA** or tried different brands? I’m curious to compare notes. This whole world of “bioelectric health” is bigger than I realized.

When I married my husband, his little girl became my greatest treasure. We were BFFs right away; we love fairies, flowers, ballet and opera, clothes and dressing up, pink and purple, dolls, girly pop music, and everything cute and fuzzy.



For years, she asked me when I was going to have a baby and give her a little sister. The whole time her dad and I were trying to conceive, I envisioned a team of spunky little girls to make flower crowns with us and find bugs and rocks and birdwatch and wear matching outfits.   



When I found out I was pregnant, all I cared about was having a healthy baby and didn't care about the gender. But as the weeks went on, I was convinced it was going to be a girl! I only craved sweet things, I seemed to be carrying high (at first), I had morning sickness, and the heart rate during ultrasounds was always 140+. I felt such a strong, motherly connection to the baby and my own femininity that I just knew I was growing a sister!



Then, on Father's Day, I sent the blood test results for my friend to make us a little gender reveal cake (vanilla for girl, chocolate for boy). I was craving chocolate that day so I joked that it's too bad it's definitely a girl because I want that chocolate cake 😂 



When my husband cut into the cake and I saw that (delicious) chocolate, the main feeling coursing through me was SHOCK. I had been convinced!! Then, to my shame, the smallest bit of disappointment. It wasn't going to be a sister who we could put in matching dresses and dance around a Maypole (lol). It was going to be a little boy, and wtf am I going to do with a boy?? I didn't have brothers, my male cousin who was closest with me is gay and never liked anything stereotypically masculine, what if the baby loves trucks?? We don't attribute interests to specific gender, but how do I support his interests if they end up being something I can't relate to?



Fast forward a few months - the baby is coming! A month early!! My water broke at 2 pm and less than 4 hours later, I'm pushing this nugget out completely unmedicated. I felt his 5 lb body shoot out of me and lowkey dissociated for a bit while he lay on my chest. I finally looked down at him.... and his eyes were open, looking right back! He had my husband's eyes. The next night, I had my ""oh wait I'm obsessed with you"" moment when I realized he had my nose and mouth.



Now, he's almost 6 months old and I can't imagine having anything but this little budgie boy. He's beyond perfection. He's always happy, loves people, calmly plays on his tummy and explores his toys, and laughs at everything and everybody. And he sleeps through the night 👀



When I look into his dark eyes, I see my husband's eyes looking into mine onstage, under the lights when we were just goofy theatre kids. I see them the day they glittered with tears as I walked down the aisle with my dad toward him at our wedding. 



I see myself in his dark curls and little button nose. When he's asleep, his little rosebud mouth gets all squished up like in my baby pictures. 



I see my grandmother in his fat cheeks and round little chin. When I kiss those cheeks, I remember being in my grandmother's kitchen. I remember feeding her birds in the back garden and always having a dish of orange sherbet as a treat or warm coffee cake for breakfast. 



And maybe best of all, I hear his sister, my little partner in crime, in his happy giggles. They absolutely adore each other, and she makes him laugh all day every day. 



Every night (and most naptimes), my sweet baby boy falls asleep in my arms, nursing. As he is drifting off, he takes his chubby little index finger and traces it around on my shoulder, my wrist, whatever he can touch. He strokes and squeezes and holds onto my skin and feels so safe and warm as he falls asleep. I press kisses onto his soft face and hair. It is the greatest peace and joy that I will ever know.



So, in conclusion, as a complete girly girl who did have my gender disappointment moment, I would be THRILLED to be having another boy.

This is how I like my squares, black(to avoid unnecessary attention), and silver buttons, the classic look. Positive displays are always preferred over negative though once in a while negative displays rock. ",21,1748715250.0,gshock,0,1.0,False

But I couldn't forget about this clip, even though I watched it almost a year ago.

The way the annoying emo girl (Starfire's daughter) runs away from home was identical to how I did it in high school.

I didn't had any friends, I didn't know any places to go. The nearest coffee shop was the safest option. And I'm embarrassed about how much of a coward I was.

My personality is way far from what I want to be and it will always be that way. I can never change how I was in the past, my past will always be my biggest shame.

The girl in the comic looks exactly like how I avoid to look and act, yet I can find myself experiencing the same things as her, and seeing somebody making fun of how cowardly and pathetic it was.

No men has this embarrassment of a past. It's the most fembrained thing ever. I can never run from my female mind. I can never be a man. IWNBAM.

**Sex and the City Was About Relationships. And Just Like That… Has Become About Money**

by: David Mack


*Three seasons in, the sequel series—like its characters—has gotten way too comfortable.*

And just like that, “And Just Like That…” is back for its third season on HBO Max, the streaming platform that’s gone through almost as many branding changes as Samantha Jones has lovers. 

And, much like the relationship between Sex and the City and its fatigued revival/sequel series, things still feel similar, yet different this time around—sometimes eerily so. The new season, which premieres on Thursday night, opens with the patron saint of “West Village girls,” Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), sitting and writing, as she is wont to do, by a window. 

The space she’s in looks somewhat similar to the iconic studio apartment she gave up at the end of Season 2, down to the coffee table and the walk-through closet. But then, as she dons a pink tulle coat to go with the pink tulle dress she’s wearing (apparently to go to the post office?!), we get the reveal: 

Carrie is actually in her new townhome in Manhattan’s pricey Gramercy Park neighborhood, complete with tasteful wall moldings, custom floor inlays, a state-of-the-art alarm system, and a sweeping staircase that connects its two grand levels. Long gone are the days when our girl was using the oven as a place to store sweaters and had less than $1,000 in her savings account.

Carrie’s new digs, alongside other changes this season, illustrate the key problem with “And Just Like That…”

With the departures of the “queer nonbinary Mexican Irish diva” podcast host Che (Sara Ramírez) and Nya Wallace (Karen Pittman), the Columbia Law School professor who befriended Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) ostensibly out of pity, AJLT has now lost its only two vaguely middle-class characters. 

(Not to mention that their loss represents a step back for a show that was desperately trying to diversify itself, although thankfully we still have plenty of facetime with Sarita Choudhury’s glamorous realtor Seema Patel).

Three seasons in, AJLT is firmly and unabashedly a show about some of the wealthiest women in New York and their trivial rich-people problems. If SATC was once a revolutionary show about sex and dating, AJLT is now too often a series about money and the carefree lifestyle that wealth provides the leisure class. 

Certainly, these characters aren’t facing the same problems they were several decades ago—nor do we expect them to. They’re older now, more settled, and dealing with teenage children or widowhood. 

But I, like other viewers, find myself coming back to these beloved characters out of obligation and curiosity, not for any real excitement or wonder. In its third season, AJLT is more content than ever plodding along (albeit in Manolos) as little more than a pedestrian fantasy that’s lost most of the spunk and spark of the original series. Like its characters’ lives, AJLT is just … comfortable.

The series isn’t the only TV show to center on the well-moneyed, to be sure. 

HBO Max alone has, in recent years, given us The White Lotus,Succession, Industry, Hacks, The Other Two, and a Gossip Girl reboot. 

But those shows—save for that last one, perhaps—have something pointed to say about their wealthy characters and their glitzy lifestyles. 

Conversely, in AJLT, money is simply the backdrop that enables our heroines to enjoy a series of fabulous if mundane adventures. 

In the six episodes of this new season made available to critics, for example, fans can expect such thrilling storylines as Charlotte (Kristin Davis) having to search for a new dog walker because of Upper East Side gossip, as well as trying to hire a cutthroat college admissions guide to get daughter Lily (Cathy Ang) into an Ivy League school. 

Carrie, meanwhile, spends much of the season pining over a designer dining table, relandscaping her garden, or trying to replace a pane of antique glass. She’s already had to wait six months for fabric for her chaise longue, she tells us. 

The horror!

Oddly enough, AJLT now feels closer not to SATC, but to HBO’s period show “The Gilded Age.”

The two series sharing Nixon as a star aside, both are escapist soaps where fashion is paramount, and not much else happens besides a few romances. 

(Last season, The Gilded Age opened with a thrilling montage of Easter hats, while this season AJLT serves up a medley of Carrie walking in dozens of high heels that terrorize her downstairs neighbor, set to the song “These Boots Are Made for Walkin’.”) 

Still, at least the upstairs-downstairsnature of The Gilded Age means that the show has to, at a minimum, pretend to care about its poorer servant characters before treating us once again to the prettier rich-lady costumes. 

It’s a balanced diet, while AJLT is all sugar all the time. 

In one scene this season, Charlotte wears a massive string of pearls while her friend Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker) wears a jacket dripping in pearls from practically every seam. 

“They’re having a pearl-off!” I said to no one in particular.

Were these characters always so self-involved? (I already know the answer.) 

Carrie is, of course, the textbook embodiment of “main character syndrome,” so it’s not that surprising to see her treat her downstairs neighbor with such disdain, equating the idea of walking around her timber floors while not wearing heels to having her feet amputated. 

She also spends significant chunks of time obsessing over the meaning of a thumbs-up emoji from her on-again, off-again boyfriend Aidan (John Corbett). “I don’t want to seem ridiculous. His family’s in crisis and I’m obsessing about an emoji,” she says in one small, blessed flash of self-awareness.


The best parts of this season come when Carrie decamps to Virginia to visit Aidan on his farm, leaving behind the trappings and trapdoors of big-city life. 

Despite the two being in love, Aidan moved back there at the end of Season 2 to live with his teenage sons, one of whom is going through a particularly rough period. 

He had asked Carrie for a five-year pause in their relationship—a freeze that initially stifles any real plots for Carrie this season. 

But once they reconnect properly, we see a newer side to Carrie. Fans of SATC will recall how Carrie behaved like a brat when she had to be dragged by her designer heels to Aidan’s upstate New York cabin in Season 4’s “Sex and the Country.” 

This time, though, she’s more serene and just seems happy to be with him. Hell, she even rides an ATV at one point. Watching Carrie interact with Aidan’s sons is moving, not just because it’s a side of her we haven’t seen before, but also because she’s genuinely deferential (maybe for the first time ever?) to his family. 

One tense dinner, in particular, stands out because of her poise.

It’s in these scenes that Carrie shows real growth and a wisdom that can only come with age, which feels like when AJLT comes closest to its raison d’être. It’s rare to see women in their 50s and 60s explored on television, with their still-in-flux lives proof that they’re not completely dead and settled yet. What do you do with your life, like Carrie, when your partner dies just as you’re entering your autumn years? Or how should you navigate, like one character has to this season, a troubling health diagnosis for a loved one?

“I loved everything as it was, but now that’s all changed, so I don’t know what comes next,” Carrie tells a landscaper about her garden, in words that could apply to both her life and AJLT itself, at its best and most urgent.

“That’s exciting—not knowing,” he tells her. 

“Because then what is meant to be has the space to show up.”

Yet, just like Carrie sitting at her computer and staring out her bedroom window, I couldn’t help but wonder … what if this show aimed this high all the time? 

What if the scales tipped away more often than not from the pretty in favor of this ugly side of life? 

What if, instead of fantasy, AJLT leaned even further into the reality that it’s so good at touching on, in the rare moments that it dares to?

Maybe it’s a me problem. 

Maybe I’m misreading the audience here. 

Maybe what we’re all craving in these dark times is a trifling distraction about ladies who lunch. Lord knows that I will keep tuning in, and probably will until each of these characters is sent off in an understated coffin topped with tasteful, all-white flowers. 

“I cannot look away,” Miranda says this season of some low-culture TV show she’s come to embrace against her better nature. “I’ve finally discovered the joy of hate-watching.” 

You and me both, Miranda.
