1hmwson,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1hmwson/lamarzocco/,LaMarzocco ,"I have a question about making espresso. I'm a barista and help with quality control at my café where we use a La Marzocco coffee machine. I'm in charge of adjusting how fine we grind the coffee and other similar tasks.
I'd like some advice from more experienced baristas since I'm still learning. Right now, when I make espresso shots, they sometimes take about 100 seconds to pour, which I know is pretty long. When I try making the coffee grounds coarser to speed this up, the coffee ends up tasting way too sour.
But what I really want to know is whether these long shot times are bad for our machine. Could letting an espresso shot run for 100 seconds damage the machine or its group heads? One of our repair technicians said this might be causing problems with the machine. Should I be sticking to a maximum time limit when pulling shots? What's your take on this?",1,1735243788.0,barista,0,1.0,False
1hmwrhd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1hmwrhd/i_dont_think_my_husband_is_cheating_currently_but/,"I don't think my husband is cheating currently, but i'm growing suspicious of a past affair","I genuinely have had the gut feeling my husband has been cheating on me or has, and only with one specific girl, not necessarily a jealousy of every woman who interacts with him type thing.

She was my husband's coworker, and she already had a previous coworkers baby so I already know she must have some type of flirty demeanor at work. Her and that man are not together and never were officially but she still had the baby.

She has hearted all of my husband's FB posts, including the ones of me and our baby.

My husband switched jobs and when he updated his linkedin, she immediately screenshotted and texted him saying congratulations and saying she wanted to send a present for our new baby ( i have never met this woman so idk why she feels the need to send a gift). I told my husband this upsets me because why is a random old coworker messaging you directly instead of just liking the linkedin post. And also mentioning me and our baby. And on top of that my husband was overusing emojis (like 5 laughing faces in a row) when he doesn't even use them while texting normally, so i see it as flirting. He said he will delete the messages because he's sorry that SEEING them made me upset. So now I have anxiety he has messaged her a lot in the past or still is but just deleting them before I see them.

This made me spiral and think of every sus interaction my husband has had with this girl.

1. She always messaged my husband for simple things like how to claim her child on her taxes, which could easily have been done by anybody else besides my husband.
2. my husband had to do a lot of offsite work and said him and his coworker would stop at the Wegman's food court to eat lunch, he also slyly mentioned that his coworker lived in that same area of town ina  different conversation. But he claimed he was doing these offsites with a different coworker.
3. He said her name in his dream once, sleep talking about wanting to talk more with her.
4. he randomly getting promo updates from Fenty x Savage ( a lingerie company) and he has never bought me anything from that site and he claims he doesn't know why his number is on that promo list bc he's never bought anything.
5. my husband used to say he would buy donuts for his office from the dunkin inside his building, but the charge was always like $8 ( the price of two coffees not a dozen box of donuts)
6. my husband has never actually been gone from home, if he's not at work he's with me. But because he does so many offsites Im starting to get concerned there might have been even just an emotional affair.

It's just a feeling I cant shake and I want to know if im valid for being insecure about these things before I confront him about it.",1,1735243696.0,Infidelity,1,1.0,False

I have some planned purchases for next year; like a new desk, since I work from home and my current desk is too small. It's a yellow light because on my list because I know it can trigger the desire to buy new accessories and organizational things.

As a result of working from home, I don't leave the house much (except for the library as couple times a week or the grocery store to pick up snacks or something missed on the grocery list). My boyfriend and I don't eat out much (cheaper to cook at home) or go to the movies often (easier to wait for a copy at the library or use my student discount if we really want to see it in theatres). So coffee, dining out, and moviesare allowed next year. 

I anticipate this to change over the course of the year as things come up. My ultimate goal with this is to be in control of my spending and teach myself not to rely on credit cards too much. 

To help understand what I really have, I'll be making inventory lists of craft supplies (including patterns), books, lego sets, clothes, and beauty/hygiene items.  ",1,1735243684.0,nobuy,0,1.0,False

1hmwqq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1hmwqq9/how_do_i_control_my_appetite_after_quitting/,How do I control my appetite after quitting nicotine?,"Hi, all.

I have recently quit nicotine after 8 years of heavy usage, but have noticed an almost insatiable appetite.

I’m very small with a BMI of around 23 and a decent, probably tiny bit above average amount of muscle mass:fat. I’m 5’3 and 3 quarters and 60kg (132lbs / 9st 6lbs)

Since quitting nicotine, I am extremely hungry a large amount of the time. I’m concerned about gaining weight I don’t need as my TDEE is quite small, as the only exercise I do is running which doesn’t exactly burn many calories.

Nothing seems to sate my hunger; complex carbs, casein protein, a lot of fibre, etc. I eat 2 meals a day and drink coffee in the morning as I’m not usually hungry in the morning. My meals are typically a meat, a salad and a whole grain (rice, grain pasta, etc.)

Is it just a case of dealing with my hunger until I’m used to it or are there methods to make my body realise that I don’t need the calories it seems to want? Given my small figure and my exercise of choice not burning many calories, I’m very reluctant to just “eat when I’m hungry” as that’ll lead to me reaching an unhealthy rate and expanding my stomach more.",1,1735243639.0,NoStupidQuestions,0,1.0,False

Christmas is almost here and I've got essentially 8 days of me, myself, all the beige foods in the world and some alcohol, join me?

so anyway, about me? I am 26, living in the UK but hopeful to move one day. I work for a very popular company that I cannot say the name of, but you'll have heard of them before. My primary passion in life has always been my work and I feel like it's time that shifted to someone else, so that's why I am here! maybe you'll be the lucky person! What am I looking for you ask? I have no idea, friends, lovers, haters, who knows. I'm a terrible flirt so apologies in advance.

I am an avid reader, my bookcase is full of books i've yet to read and a lot of I have read and cannot come to terms with giving away. If I am not reading I will likely be sat under a blanket somewhere in my house playing video games. As with most people on Reddit, I am indeed a huge nerd. I love to code & paint too! I am really just spraying my thoughts onto this right now, there is only so much you can say about yourself without writing a life story.

As for other things I like to do:

Stumble into things, I am very clumsy. Drink an ungodly amount of coffee, listen to music far too loud on my headphones, order too much food for myself and regret it later, pretend like I understand politics, suck at boardgames and sing karaoke.

happy to swap photos etc. just don't be super weird or uninterested in talking. I am also not picky about where you are from, so don't let that put you off :) hope to speak to you soon

1hmwlur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mirtazapine_Remeron/comments/1hmwlur/i_wanna_get_back_to_it/,I wanna get back to it,"Here’s a summary of my story:
I took mirtazapine 15mg + lexapro for 4 years to help with ptsd, sleep and generalized anxiety as I grew up in a very dangerous slum in Brazil.
In 2021 I moved to the Netherlands and November of last year I clearly didn’t need it anymore and I was curious to know who I was without the meds. The biggest reason honestly was my sex drive was null but I’ll never know if it was the meds or my very absent partner.

I started tapering out w my psychiatrist and also broke up this relationship. I’ve been off for a year now.

I immediately started having mild gastritis, acid reflux, decreased appetite and lost a lot of weight.
It could be anxiety but I was a foodie before so I think it’s the withdrawal. Honestly can’t say for sure, I have strong physical anxiety even if my mind is calm.

Throughout the year this was manageable but I had to stop drinking coffee, alcohol, eating chocolate, couldn’t pole dance or lay flat anymore. Had at least 3 really bad episodes of that I somewhat fixed with anti acids.

Then in October I removed my wisdom teeth and had to take antibiotics + started dating.
1. It’s simply impossible to sleep with someone else (with mirt I would just blackout). 
2. The gastrits became a full blown acid reflux that won’t go away for shit. I basically can’t eat anything, I’m losing social moments and have to take PPIs everyday.

I miss my life. I miss eating, drinking, sleeping with my partner.

I wanna try to go back to Mirt but:
1. Will it fix the reflux or did it break my digestive system beyond repair?
2. How dangerous it really is? Doctors always say it’s the safest drug out there but the drowsiness was no joke and this withdrawal I’m having a year after isn’t either...

PPIs or mirtazapine?
Any thoughts?

One recurring annoyance is that people take stuff that they aren’t consuming at the house, they just help themselves. For example, we have a large jar of coffee pods and another with an assortment of teas. Most guests consume a few, you find them in the garbage, it’s all good. But other guests take them all… they clearly walk around the house and take EVERYTHING. 

Last nights guests took all the coffee pods, tea, extra rolls of toilet paper, laundry pods, boxes of plastic ware, plates, stuff like that. (Plus crazy shit like taking apart lamps, pens, rearranging furniture… looks like someone slept on the floor.)

This happens a few times per year and each time it does it annoys us even though we know it’s just part of the deal, it just feels like our hospitality is being abused. 

Should we just accept that 1 in 20 guests is going to take everything or should we stop being so generous and leave them just enough of everything? How are others managing similar annoyances?

[I should add that we do this because it’s what we like when we travel.

I grant, this is both privileged and niche. But my god, as someone who travels relatively frequently, I like to reduce stress as much as possible. That includes lounge access.

Ive only started going to lounges in the last 18 months, but I’ve been vegan 10 years, so I have a pretty low bar. But these places can’t even clear my lowest expectations.

Ironically, unlike most restaurants, breakfast tends to be best, often with oatmeal, fruit, potatoes, toast/bagels with jam or nut butter. Some SkyClubs have had chia pudding and beyond sausages too.

But lunch/dinner? Nope. Once in Canada, I had chana masala. But at pretty much every other lounge I’ve been to, I’m lucky to get anything other than a vegetable. Maybe I get salad (no beans or grains) and a vegetable. Maybe some plain rice. Hilariously, I often can’t even get bread.

Plenty of “vegetarian” options. Plenty of staff suggesting that I can eat those. So. Much. Cheese. In. Everything. So many “chef curated menus” that essentially amount to varieties animal chunks bathed in animal fluids.

I just want to confirm whether there is a positive side to what happened?","About a month ago I posted on this subreddit about my budding romantic relationship. The guy in question is considerate, funny. cuddly, great conversationalist and gave me a ride to work 150 km away and WAITED FOR ME. I never had before a relationship with a man willing to sacrifice his time or being as generous as he has been with me. And for this reason I am heartbroken.

Mandatory warning because I may go into sexual details, including ED and trauma bond.

I posted here because he was finding difficult to maintain an erection. He continued with the same difficulties during the following weeks and I asked how could I help. We tried handjobs, blowjobs, conventional sex and different positions, but the issue continued. He was able to ejeculate through masturbation, which worked in most occasions. Some other times we had to stop and try the next day. This understandably caused frustation and we further discussed the topic. He explained me that some times he was getting distracted because of my expressiveness and some times he was also resentful that I was able to orgasm, while he could not focus enough to follow through. Thus, I tried to be less loud and move less after I had orgasmed, so he could focus enough to continue with the erection and ejaculate. I was disappointed that sex was not always enough for him to reach the orgasm and I felt that I lacked skills or ability or even appeal to help him. He, however, told me that it had nothing to do with me, but with his own thoughts and that he had a lot going on on his mind, preventing him from concentrating on the sex.

This morning I had an appointment and needed to get ready. We were in bed fooling around and we ended up having sex, and he was not able to come. I did and after a while I decided that I needed to start moving, so I told him, went to plug my mobile and prepared to get a shower. Apparently he was incredibly frustrated because we were trying to have sex for 2 days and he was feeling like he needed to release himself, so he told me to come back to bed. We started kissing and he initiated penetration and ended up ejaculating inside me. I do not take oral contraception because of my anxiety medication, and he knows it. He got up, cleaned himself, and went to make coffee and left me in the bed, until I asked him to bring me toilet tissue to clean myself. I went in the shower and I talked to him after I went out and told him that I was disappointed at myself because I felt unable to help him to reach orgasm. But I also said that the most upsetting thing for me was that I was not expecting him to ejaculate inside me without a warning and that I felt used because he basically penetrated me to release himself. I also mentioned that I was bothered because it was the second time that he ejaculated inside without a warning, and that although I stay put to allow him to release, I don't think that was acceptable. He said that he was feeling frustrated because I was going to leave and he would go home and be frustrated for a long while because he was unable to ejaculate, so he decided to be the asshole and use me to come. He expressed he was sorry and he acknowledged that this behaviour was childish and wrong, and that his intention was not to hurt me and that his frustrations and ED had nothing to do with me and that he was appreciative that I was addressing this topic. I said that, while I understood that maybe it was difficult for him to control himself and his erections, I am a person who finds difficult to set boundaries with the people I like, because I had felt inadequate my whole life and I am afraid of rejection, thanks to my childhood environment and the parental influence. I am in therapy and I take medication for the anxiety, which is not due to my high stress job, but because of masking, as I am neurodivergent and I have tried to fit for most of my life. Not anymore though. My AuADHD was a major cause of criticism from my family and it left a deep mark.

In any case, I was heartbroken because I felt used, he acknowledged that he used me like a piece of meat and he said that he was resentful because he was unable to ejaculate, while I orgasmed several times on the past days. He apologised, he promised to work on his issues at work so to have a clearer mind and he called me later to check on me. I am still sad, and I said that maybe it's good to take some distance. I just don't know if there will be anything positive coming out of this. This is the first time I have sex without a condom with a partner, it's the first time that a partner consistently cuddles me and that I feel desired. It's also the first relationship where I receive positive reinforcement, mental stimulation and even gifts, and support as evident as rides to work, a birthday present or food and a visit when I am sick. Maybe you all will tell me to let him go and maybe it is indeed over, but I am feeling so much sorrow.

I am still waiting on a response a month later. My viewpoint was formed from my numerous vacations at comparable all-inclusive resorts. This particular resort and brand is 3 out of 5, at best. 

November 25, 2024
Dawn Smith
Sandals Royal Caribbean 
Montego Bay, Jamaica 

Dear Dawn Smith,
This letter is in response to your request for a review. We booked this vacation specifically for my 50th birthday on November 19. We are seasoned travelers who prefer an all inclusive experience, so please keep in mind I am comparing against similar resorts. 
I am going to start with great kudos to the staff. They were pleasant and kind, however noticeable lack of staff. Everything ran slow due to the lack of staff. Simply put, it appears your trying to run your establishment with minimal staff and the guests both notice and feel it. 
It is very clear this resort is aged. I’ll start with simple comfort, which was difficult to attain at your resort. The beds, the mattresses, the pads are all worn out and worn down. Having a mattresses directly on wooden slats is not comfortable, the mattress had noticeable divots in it from years of large person use. The same for the pads on the pool chairs (I used three beach towels folded under me to fill in the dent); same for the mattress on the Bali beds by the pool- all need replacing. 
Let’s go back to the room. The A/C unit is a nightmare with its own agenda. It chooses its own speed and temperature, spinning at a tornadic speed in the middle of the night, while the unit blinks spasmodically. We asked the housekeeper how to operate it, how to make it stop blinking, and she told us “Everyone just covers it up”. Great, we paid $5000 to do this for a week. 
When we arrived we had a bath mat, it disappeared and didn’t reappear until the last day. Subsequently the floor never appeared to be swept or mopped so, with no bath mat or rug at the bedside, sand was always in the bed, always. Our hand towels disappeared also, why? The housekeeper even took our beach towels away. Why are they touching anything? And while I’m on towels, there are none by dinner time. If you plan to take a late swim or dip in the hot tub, there are no towels. They do not get replaced until after 7am, I know, I watched every morning. 
So you request we “be green” by handing our towels to dry, but there is exactly ONE hook in the entire room- in the shower. And grossly, there are none in the public restrooms- where do I put my beach bag? On the floor- certainly not!
Why is water so hard to find and obtain? The staff, as previously stated, are busy. If I request a water, it could be 20 minutes before it arrives. I only found one ice machine with water dispenser, and it was way back by our room, well past the reception area. 
The new coffee machine is gross. It comes out ridiculously hot and it’s not real cappuccino. The powder is reminiscent of gas station coffee. Did guests actually ask for this, or did they ask for cappuccino, because this new machine is not hitting the mark. 
Why does the resort wide sound system blare rave music at 4am? Why is it playing music at night at all? It’s super unnecessary. While sitting at the pool there are two separate sound systems blaring, competing for attention? Why? Why do the entertainment people need to yell into the microphone? Do they really think those on the beach are listening- they’re not. 
When sitting on the beach, the dive boat Krakken, arrives by 8am, with engines running. They keep them running all day, causing the exhaust to pool on the beach in the cay- are you actively trying to asphyxiate your guests? 
But I think my least favorite was being out on a morning walk on Wednesday, on the beach and getting completely gases by your mosquito fogger. Even the staff went running and I had no idea what it was. Why don’t you warm people that you do this every Wednesday and Saturday morning? 
The most frustrating part of our vacation was dinner, hands down. It took us most of the week to figure out how to work your system. For the Italian or Spices, arrive when they open and you’ll get a table. Anything later, and the wait will be 1 1/2 hours plus. We had to abandon the wait and eat at Cricketers instead, due to extensively long waits. I thought the waiting issue would be resolved with reservations, which seems like more of a suggestion than a reservation. The single MOST frustrating meal just happened to be my 50th birthday dinner, the reason we came to Sandals. I requested a 6pm dinner reservation, as I was concerned about the timing and taking the shuttle to Montego Bay, and being that this was our big event, I expected the resort to honor this one request- our purpose for booking. We were given a 7:30 reservation, and everything went downhill. We arrived on time, however we then had to wait, and wait, and wait. As you know, the shuttle was leaving at 9:30 or the last at 10:30, depending on space. The way timing was going, we didn’t want to get stuck at Montego Bay, and we only received our meals, after telling the server our shuttle was leaving. This was at 9:13pm, for our 7:30pm reservation. I barely got to taste my birthday meal, and my husband was still eating when we got to the shuttle. And, of course, the shuttle was late arriving. Talk about a massive letdown. When we got on the shuttle I had to sit on my husband’s lap, due to a lack of seats. The 10:30 shuttle was probably just as packed.
Finally, activities. The All White party, to be exact. I saw this was a thing before we came down, I even got us each a new white outfit. We had dinner at the French place (super good!) at 7pm until about 8:30. I messaged on the Gina app to reconfirm the party was happening and they said “Yes, 9pm, on the beach”. We were there at 9pm, at both the main pool and the beach. There was no “all white party”, there was no chocolate fountain. Why? Why tell a guest something is happening when it isn’t? You tell me parties are happening, but they aren’t. Then you don’t tell me I’m going to get gassed early in the morning, but his is something people NEED to know. It really feels like your priorities are misaligned. 
You must be aware the paddle board peddlers are offering everyone cocaine, that’s not cool. Then you make it feel naughty to use marijuana on-site, even though I have a medical marijuana license- you do realize this is medicine to some of us? Some of us didn’t come to Jamaica to get high for the first time. With the changing marijuana landscape, you need to reassess your position on this. That said, stop with the cocaine. 
I will afford you the opportunity to reply, before posting this on multiple travel websites. 
Sincerely yours,

--------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're looking for a natural way to brighten your smile, combining coconut oil and turmeric might be the perfect solution. Both of these ingredients pack a punch when it comes to dental health, and together they can help in achieving whiter teeth. Let's dive into the benefits of coconut oil and turmeric for natural teeth whitening.

### The Magic of Coconut Oil

Coconut oil has gained immense popularity for its myriad health benefits, but many don't realize its potential for dental care. Here are some key advantages:

- **Antibacterial Properties:** Coconut oil contains lauric acid, which is known for fighting harmful bacteria in your mouth. This can help reduce plaque buildup, leading to healthier gums.
- **Moisturizing Effect:** This oil is a natural moisturizer, which helps keep your gums and mouth hydrated. A well-hydrated mouth can reduce the risk of cavities.
- **Oil Pulling Benefits:** Oil pulling with coconut oil can significantly improve oral hygiene. Swishing the oil in your mouth for about 15-20 minutes can help remove toxins, bacteria, and food particles.

### The Power of Turmeric

Turmeric is not just a spice; it's a powerhouse of health benefits as well. When used for teeth whitening, it offers several remarkable properties:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Naturally Brightening:** Curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, has natural whitening properties that can help brighten stained teeth.
- **Anti-inflammatory Benefits:** Turmeric can combat inflammation, making it an ideal ingredient for promoting healthy gums.
- **Antimicrobial Qualities:** It also possesses strong antimicrobial properties that can help reduce harmful bacteria in the mouth.

### How to Use Coconut Oil and Turmeric for Teeth Whitening

Combining coconut oil and turmeric into your oral care routine is easy and effective. Here’s how you can create a simple teeth whitening paste:

1. Start with 2 tablespoons of coconut oil.
2. Add 1 teaspoon of turmeric powder.
3. Mix the two ingredients until they form a smooth paste.
4. Apply the paste to your toothbrush and brush your teeth like you normally would.
5. Let the paste sit for about 5-10 minutes to maximize its whitening effect.
6. Rinse your mouth with warm water and follow it up with your regular brushing routine.

Using this method 2-3 times a week can yield noticeable results over time. The coconut oil will help remove stains, while the turmeric brightens your smile and fights bacteria.

### Additional Tips for Whiter Teeth

While coconut oil and turmeric can significantly help with teeth whitening, couple these methods with some daily practices for optimal results:

- **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day to wash away food particles and maintain a healthy mouth.
- **Avoid Staining Foods:** Limit your intake of foods and drinks that stain teeth, like coffee, tea, and red wine.
- **Regular Dental Check-Ups:** Visit your dentist regularly for cleanings and check-ups to maintain your oral health.

### What to Keep in Mind

While using coconut oil and turmeric for teeth whitening can be beneficial, it’s essential to use these ingredients wisely. Turmeric can sometimes leave a yellow tint on your toothbrush, but it washes away easily. Additionally, be cautious if you have sensitive teeth or gums; always listen to your body and stop if any irritation occurs.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
#### 1. Measure the Ingredients

Start by measuring out the coconut oil and turmeric powder. You’ll want to mix equal parts of these two ingredients, with coconut oil being the base. If you're using baking soda, measure out the same amount as the turmeric.

#### 2. Combine Ingredients

In a small bowl, add the coconut oil and turmeric. If you opted for baking soda, add it now. Stir the mixture with a spoon until it forms a uniform paste. It should be smooth and spreadable.

#### 3. Add Flavor (Optional)

If you enjoy a minty taste, you can add 1-2 drops of peppermint essential oil. This step is purely optional but can make the paste more enjoyable to use.

#### 4. Store or Use Immediately

You can use your paste right away to whiten your teeth. If you want to save some for later, store it in an airtight container. Keep it in a cool, dry place.

### How to Use Your Teeth Whitening Paste

Using the coconut oil and turmeric paste is just as easy as making it. Follow these simple steps:

#### 1. Brush Your Teeth First

Begin by brushing your teeth with your regular toothpaste. This removes plaque and prepares your teeth for the whitening treatment.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
#### 2. Apply the Paste

Take a small amount of the paste on your toothbrush. Gently apply it to your teeth, focusing on areas that are more stained. Ensure the paste covers all surfaces but avoid your gums to prevent irritation.

#### 3. Let It Sit

Leave the paste on your teeth for about 5 to 10 minutes. This allows the active ingredients to penetrate and work effectively. You can use this time to do other tasks around the house.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
#### 4. Rinse Thoroughly

After the waiting period, rinse your mouth with warm water to remove the paste completely. Make sure there’s no residue left, especially from the turmeric, which can stain if not rinsed away completely.

#### 5. Repeat Regularly

For best results, use this coconut oil and turmeric teeth whitening treatment 2-3 times a week. Consistent use may help to achieve significant whitening over time.

I recently purchased a Gaggia Classic. I've been making pour-over coffee for many years and using a Baratza Encore for grinding.

Now it's time to upgrade my coffee grinder. Unfortunately I live in Latin America and the number of options is quite limited.

I always weigh the coffee before grinding it, so I don't mind continuing to grind. I'm not interested in the displays that some models offer, since honestly, the fact of weighing the coffee dose doesn't make me need the display for anything specific.

Among the options I have, I would like to know which one you recommend (prices converted aprox):



* Eureka Manual \[$410 USD)
* Eureka Classico \[$449 USD\]
* Eureka Silenzio \[$540 USD\]
* Eureka Specialita 55 \[$739 USD\]
* Eureka Single-dose \[\[939 USD\]
* Eureka Perffetto \[710 USD\]
* Baratza Vario+ \[540 USD\]
* Baratza Sette 30 \[330 USD\]
* Baratza Sette 270 \[450 USD\] 
* Baratza Sette 270Wi \[591 USD\]

Since all Eureka models share similar characteristics, and all use a 50mm disc (except the Specialita which uses 55mm) I think they are all good options and I would go for the cheapest ones, like the Manuale or the Classico.

Since I like filtered coffee, I think I would keep my current Baratza. I think that of all the previous options, the Eureka Perfetto allowed me to continue making filters, but I don't know how viable it would be to return to a good regulation for espresso later.

I greatly appreciate your help. Thank you very much for your recommendations.

But I would like to know if the Baratza are real options versus the Eureka. I think Baratza is a good brand but at Price Point they don't offer me much more than what the Eureka offers.

The Eureka Single dose is a separate story, since it is clearly a step up, but I honestly don't know if it's really worth it in terms of what you get.",2,1735242433.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1hmw9o0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hmw9o0,And so it begins...,"Late last night, under the cover of darkness, my parents slipped out of the house whilst I slept peacefully in my room. They had stealthily packed the truck yesterday afternoon, to help facilitate their speedy escape, and had my sister, who I now no longer trust, waiting on standby with my nephews dressed and ready to go with them. They are bound for a land that is foreign to me. A place, whose borders I have never crossed. Somewhere I've only ever heard tale of in the stories that my elder family members tell from their youth. A place known simply as, Texas.

I awoke this morning to find a silent house waiting for me on the other side of my bedroom door. No faint whiff of freshly brewed coffee that was usually lingering in the air greeted me today. Just a cold, silence that even the ticking of the kitchen clock couldn't penetrate. I rounded the corner of the kitchen to find, not a note explaining the abrupt reason for my parents absence, no that would have been to clean, to kind. Instead what greated me was our big, old cat; who had begun to lose his hearing as he started getting older, and had almost completely gone totally deaf by this point. He was just standing there, near his food bowl, utterly forlorn and pitiful in his confusion as to why it had not been filled yet, like it normally would be by this time, just like it had been every day, for the past 5 years, ever since he moved into the house from the Great Outside.

His tiny, hoarse, barely a whisper of a meow floated across the room towards me. It was clear at that point that he too had the same question that I did, lurking around in his mind, ""..Why..?""

Now, with his food bowl finally filled, my coffee finished brewing, and my parents, along with my nephews, thouroughly embarked on their annual pilgrimage; an idea began to faintly spark to life from within the shadows of my brain. For too many years I have been left behind to watch the house and feed the cat. For too many years I have had to hear everyone's stories of all the amazing and grand things to do and the wonderous sights to behold. Always talking to me of their time spent there, making references to things there as if I have knowledge of the landmarks or anything in the area. All I've ever wanted was to go with them, just one time and share in that magic together. And, occasionally, I try to remind them that I haven't been yet, I always get the same canned reply ""Oh, that's right!! Well you really should go with us sometime! You'll just love it there!!"" Oh, I'm sure that I would..
I'm sure that I would......

All of this is floating and swirling around my head this morning while I sit there,  in the silence of the  kitchen, on a stool at the counter, distantly staring out the window watching the rain run little rivulets down the glass, slowly sipping my coffee, and scratching our cat behind the ears as he purs against my hand, all the while letting that little spark of an idea steadily begin to grow, and catch, and take hold in my mind. 

It should be known that, however fleeting it may have been, there was indeed, still a moment of awareness. One little sliver of a second that flashed right before the entirety of this immense, roiling, searing sea of flames that had now violently grown up around me and erupted forth from what was merely a waif of a spark moments ago and had begun to totally engulf and consume me.  Voraciously burning it's way through every fiber of my being, reducing me to nothing more than it and it becoming entirely me; a moment of final breath, cool and sweet. It was there, in that last moment of calm and clarity of self, that I did truly see how utterly disgusting and vile that the whole putrid plot was. I saw how entirely noxious and intoxicating the little thought was, as it crept and crawled it's way through my mind. Befouling every corner it lurked in, contaminating and withering every last bit of me it touched. I saw it all, and I did not care. 

How could I care? When they all left, it came. When there was no one around, there was it. It was the exact opposite of what they were. It cared for me and stuck by me, because I did the same for it. For when it came, I had welcomed it in, willingly. Sheltering it and nurturing it until it grew strong enough, all the while never knowing strong enough for what. Until, that day came, and I understood. I knew what for. And by the time I understood, I also knew that I didn't care to try and change what was to come.

The rain continued to fall on the window as I slowly opened my eyes. I was no longer sitting there alone. Nor would I ever be alone again. Hell, I was no longer even me, and yet I still was. This must be what it felt like to belong somewhere, to be included, to be a part of something more than yourself. I was mistaken when i thought that sea of flames had burned away all of who I was. I hadn't realized it until now but it was a forge that melded us together, strengthened us, and made us whole. I had, eagerly, become it, and it had, charitably, become me. We were simply two halves now put whole, in our body, our mind, and our soul. Our paths no longer wandering off to separate destinations but, instead, now firmly marching towards a singular goal. 

We would show everyone how strongly united we were. How indivisible our union. They would all quickly see that nothing will stand in our way now that we are aligned to the same goal! And we are owed our recompense for all the times they tossed us to the side, and left us behind! Our revenge will be so precise and exacting that for generations to come they will continue to feel the sharp, stinging bite of our icy retribution, just as strongly as it was felt by those who received it directly. For our time is now and they will tremble before us!! The family returns in 10 days and we have much to do to get ready for their arrival!!

1hmw0dv,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngelesTrips/comments/1hmw0dv/is_it_common_to_see_celebrities_in_la/,Is it common to see celebrities in LA?,"Hey Reddit! I've been living in LA for the past 6 years, and I often get asked by friends and family if I regularly bump into celebrities here. The short answer? Yes, but it's not as random as you might think.

Let me share my experience and some insider tips on how to maximize your chances of spotting celebrities in Los Angeles.

First off, forget about randomly running into A-listers at the grocery store (though it does happen occasionally at Whole Foods in Beverly Hills). The key is knowing where to look and when.

I've found that certain areas are celebrity hotspots:
- Beverly Hills (especially around Rodeo Drive)
- West Hollywood
- The Sunset Strip
- Maliband
- Brentwood

The trick is timing. Celebrities are more likely to be out and about during off-peak hours when there are fewer tourists. Early mornings are great for catching them during their coffee runs or gym sessions.

But here's the thing - if you're visiting LA and want a guaranteed way to see celebrity homes and learn about where they hang out, I highly recommend taking a proper tour. After trying several, I found this amazing Hollywood Sightseeing and Celebrity Homes Tour that's honestly the best bang for your buck (https://athometouch.com/celebrityhomes).

What makes this tour special is that they use open-air buses (way better than those cramped vans), and they limit it to 14 people max. The guides are actual locals who know their stuff - not just reading from scripts. Mine shared some hilarious stories about celebrity encounters that you won't find on Google.

The tour hits all the major spots:
- Hollywood Sign (perfect photo ops)
- Beverly Hills
- Celebrity mansions
- Mulholland Drive (the views are insane)
- The famous Sunset Strip

Pro tip: Book the morning tour if possible. The weather's better, and there's less traffic, which means more time at each stop.

Something most people don't realize about LA is that celebs tend to stick to their ""bubbles."" They usually hang around specific restaurants, coffee shops, and neighborhoods. This tour actually helps you understand these patterns, which is super helpful if you're planning to do some celebrity spotting on your own afterward.

I've noticed tourists often waste time in areas where they're unlikely to see any celebrities. Hollywood Boulevard, for instance, is great for tourist attractions but not for actual celebrity sightings (except during premieres at the Dolby Theatre).

Whether you take the tour or explore on your own, remember that celebrities are just people living their lives. The best encounters I've had were when I wasn't actively looking for them. But if you're here for a short time and want to maximize your chances, definitely check out that tour I mentioned. It's a great way to get oriented and understand the celebrity landscape of LA.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions about celebrity spotting in LA - happy to share more tips from my experience here.",1,1735241671.0,LosAngelesTrips,0,1.0,False
1hmw07x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hmw07x/aitah_for_being_ungrateful/,AITAH for being ungrateful??,"I (18F) live at home with my parents while I do college. My mom (40F) is a very nice and sweet mother but recently we have an issue.

For Christmas my mom is very obbessed with trying to make everything fair: equal amount of gifts, equal amount of money spent, etc etc. This year being no different but the thing about me is that I rarely spend alot of my free time around my parents let alone my mom, knowing this I offered to help her with ideas for gifts for me cause its something she has struggled with doing and I dont tend to say anything as to not hurt her feelings.

Well one day she came up to me to explain that to keep things even she wanted to get me a bunch of smaller gifts so I would have more to open and at the time I was expecting small gifts like gift cards and shirts so I agreed that would be fine and didn't worry about it.

Come Christmas day we all start to open gifts and such and I noticed that my sister (16F) is getting all
The things she wanted. Now my sister is a preppy girl no two ways about it, obsessed with Lulu lemon work out gear and uggs she probably owns nothing but those two brands. Me on the other hand I tend to consider myself more gothic/alt and dont really like uggs with the only pair I own being an old old pair of boots that I had to get for a snowy trip.

My mom is fully aware of our differences as its really no secret as to who likes what. But my sister opened a gift and it turned out to be a pair of uggs slippers, something she has always wanted and has sent the link to my mom hundreds of times to make sure she got it, well not even a minute later the next gift I opened was also a pair of uggs slippers that were in a different color. While at first I wasn't excited I just faked a smile and pushed them to the side and tried to move everything along cause I'm not going to freak out over one gift especially when I have two other things I really wanted which was a new laptop and a heating pad.

Well the next gifts were all very similar, I opened boxes to see clothes that didn't fit me nor actually things I wanted or even from stores that I offered up as ideas. There were two long sleeved shirts in both black and white, a tank top that was black and frilly like a toddlers tank top, a cardigan, and a hoodie that was cropped. As well as a 25 dollar necklace which is something she always gets us is cheap necklaces and I probably have like ten of them in my jewelry box untouched.

Well while I did get two things I wanted that were rather expensive I felt like all the other gifts were just filler and things that were just easy to get cause she was already buying things for my sister. She even admitted whilei was opening most of my gifts that she had kept the tags and receipts all for the clothing and other gifts cause she knew that i probably wouldn't want them and when I wasn't touching the box with the ugg slippers she ended up just taking them and putting them in her closet.

Now, I have to dig through for the receipts and everything having to give back more than half of my gifts because I know I just won't wear them or use them and it feels like a waste of money. I would have honestly rather opened two gifts that I loved then opened fifty gifts of things that I dont love or even have wanted in the first place. I tried to talk and text my mom about my feelings and she just claimed I was ungrateful and said that “it feels like you are taking inventory of what everyone has” 

Added context as well: i also had gotten everyone else gifts that I felt like was meaningful or would help with stuff they do like I got my mom a self heating mug cause her coffee always gets cold before she finishes it and my dad a bunch of grilling accessories cause he refuses to buy anything new for himself. I had bought all those gifts way back during thanksgiving and I feel like if I was able to take advantage of of sales and the timing of everything to get people gifts I know they would want or use then my mom could have done something similar and maybe I wouldn't have to sit here and try to figure out how I'm going to return everything that isn't the two things I wanted",2,1735241659.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

When I got home I started hitting the first stages of nicotine withdrawal and had to negotiate really hard with myself not to go and buy a vape, because once I buy it it's done, I won't put the stupid thing down for the next 5 days and then I'm hooked again. I was able to push away the thoughts successfully yesterday but tonight I had a dream that I'm buying a vape without nicotine though. So now I'm drinking my morning coffee and negotiating with myself again not to go and buy a stupid vape.

1hmvmdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hmvmdn/aitah_for_feeling_disappointed_with_christmas/,AITAH for feeling disappointed with Christmas ,"I (18F) am the oldest of two sisters, my sister (16F) is always spending time with my mom (40F). I could tell that for her it was alot easier to get my sister gifts because of that and I knew that most of my gifts were going to be smaller things as my mom has this huge thing about making sure everything is even with money spent, amount, etc and even asked me about the smaller gifts so I would open an equal amount as my sister. At first I didn't care and that was due to the fact I didn't know what she had planned but since I dont spend as much time with my mom as much as my sister does I tried to do my best to give her ideas and stuff she could get me like shirts from my favorite stores or Tiny room decor options since I will be moving out very soon.

Come Christmas day and I'm starting to open gifts and I noticed that most of the gifts aren't items that were either on the list or even from stores I had mentioned I liked, my sister had also got alot of matching gifts as me just in different colors but the biggest few gifts that really made me question the amount of thought and care she had for the gifts was a pair of UGGS slippers.

My sister loves uggs and has multiple pairs of boots and what not in different colors, I dont like uggs and the only pair I have was a pair I had to buy for a trip to a snowy area and I already didn't own a pair of boots. My mom is fully aware about my stance on uggs and yet after my sister opened her pair of uggs the next gift I open was also a pair of uggs slippers but in a different color. I faked a smile and just placed the slippers to the side and just somewhat brushed it off as a one time thing but then the next few gifts I have opened were all clothing that I couldn't wear nor needed. 

While I dont mind getting a new shirt, socks, and what not and in fact encourage people to get me clothing if they are really wanting to get me something thats not expensive. All the clothing I was opening weren't even from stores I recommended, ontop of that as I was opening one box my mother made a comment of “dont worry we can return all of those, I kept the receipts and tags on them for that reason” . They were plain long sleeve shirts, a random graphic tee with a raccoon on it, a black cardigan, and a cropped hoodie. 

While I did get things I wanted, a heating pad and a new laptop, it just felt like most of those gifts were last minute and were just copy and paste of what my sister got in a different color. Now I feel like the bad guy for having to ask for the receipts and stores to return all of these things and I feel bad for all the money she had to drop on these gifts. 

I tried to text her about my feelings but was met with hostility and told that “im ungrateful” “sounds like you are keeping inventory” “you got more gifts than I did”

As a side note: both me and my sister have jobs. My sister doesn't spend her money unless she has to, if she can bum it off my parents then she will. I usually pay for all of my things if I can with only my parents helping me with bills and car insurance as I dont understand those things yet. For Christmas both me and my sister got my parents gifts, I felt like I had alot of thought behind mine with a night light helper for when she reads as well as a self heating coffee mug because her coffee always goes cold when she tries to drink it.

I dont want to be ungrateful and if I am I am sorry but I would have rather open just two gifts that meant alot to me like my new laptop then to also open fifty more that I will just have to return or give away cause I know I won't use them.",1,1735240620.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False
1hmvlrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1hmvlrp/how_far_back_in_the_process_should_i_go_for/,How far back in the process should I go for reintroduction? ,"A few months ago, my husband and I brought a stray cat into our household. We already had 3 cats (Arwen, Dresden, and Tyrion) and she would be the fourth. She is an absolute sweetheart.

At the time, we quarantined her in the bathroom away from the other cats to both go through the slow introduction process, and to make sure she was cleared by the vet of any medical concerns/fleas before letting them interact.

Once we got the green light from the vet, we did visual only meets for a few weeks, and then let them interact. Cashmere was shy, Dresden and Tyrion (the boys) were fine with her. Neutral to Good experiences. Arwen was being very neutral. We expected this from her, and we’re glad that it was Neutral and not hissing etc.

We even reached the point of Arwen cuddling on the couch, Cashmere climbing up to join and Arwen stayed and was perfectly content 

However, I am Arwen’s person, and work these past few months have my schedule off, and Arwen took the frustration out on Cashmere. After a long weekend out of town for work, Arwen has begun chasing Cashmere. She’ll chase her either under the coffee table or on top of one of the dining room chairs. Cashmere  hisses and runs away.

It’s definitely time for a reintroduction, but I’m not sure how far back to go. All the way to the beginning with complete separation? Or to visual only meetings? 

Also to add: we have 4 litter boxes (and potentially may receive a litter robot from a family member as well) and food/water never seems to be an issue for Arwen. They’ll sometimes even eat next to each other. It seems she is purely guarding the resource of me from what I can tell. 

I’m not looking for them to be absolutely best friends, that’s for sure an unrealistic expectation. But I just want them to be neutral with each other. ",1,1735240574.0,CatAdvice,0,1.0,False

I just got a Breville Bambino Plus as a Christmas gift, and I'm super excited about it! But, it's my first espresso machine, so I want to create a way to keep track of the beans and grind size I try so I can discover what I like.

So far, I have a spreadsheet with the following info: brand, blend, origin, roast, flavor notes, arabica/robusta.

As far as ratings go, I have a space for general drip coffee (I plan on using this as my baseline so I can tell if any issues I have making espresso are with incorrectly pulling a shot or if I just don't like the taste of those beans). I also have a place I can put the rating of the espresso itself, coupled with the grind size I used for that specific rating (figuring it will take me several tries, especially at first, to find the grind size that works best).

I might in the future add a column for ratios and a spot for notes on what I liked/didn't like. What else would you recommend I add to or change in the chart as I find the beans I enjoy?",4,1735240518.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

[Breville Bambino Plus / DF54 Grinder],"I recently picked up this powerful duo for Christmas and I have been playing around with the shots trying to get it all dialed in. I have tried two different beans, and they both are coming out way too sour.

Here are some stats:

I've tried 18g, 17g, 16g for the amount of beans and have varied between 20-15 on the grind setting on the DF54. Including the pre-extraction, the time it takes varies between 25-33 seconds. The total yield also results in around 2.5x-3x the total amount.

I've tried a manual shot, where I let it run for 40+ seconds and it tastes much better with very little sour notes. The problem with this is that it is no longer a ""shot"" of espresso but rather a 1/4 of a cup full of coffee.

I'm a bit lost on what variables to adjust at this point. It seems like no matter what I change, the sour taste still is there - even if I change beans.

I understand that this is due to an under-extraction of the beans. How would you recommend I proceed?",1,1735240264.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

I did not drink since July 17th. I was never an alcoholic like grandpa. I just wanted to reduce my alcohol consumption. Then you died and I knew I couldn’t drink to get through it. I would have died. I had a drink at the end of the school year and once this summer. And then I stopped. 

Christmas has been hard without you and without a drink to forget for just a minute. And it’s not over. We have our Christmas dinner with my sisters and stepmom on the 28th. And you won’t be there. I know we will cry. And the kids will be uncomfortable. 

On January 6th, I start a new job. I’ll be vice-principal in high school.

I included some info about my income, but wanted to focus mostly on my spending. For some background, I’m a 34F who lives in a VHCOL area. I’m single, own my condo outright after paying off the mortgage in 2019, work remotely in tech, and have a few side gigs that include running an Instagram account with a decent following (I do not like calling myself an “influencer” though lol) as well as some dog walking/sitting. I’m happy to be debt-free and try my best to live frugally, mostly due to my upbringing as a first-generation immigration and my desire to FIRE in some form or another.

# Income:

**Post-Tax and Deduction Income: $155,127.80** 💰 

* I maxed out my pre-tax 401(k) and HSA contributions for the year, so this does not include those amounts. This also does not include any income from any of my investment accounts (dividends and interest) as they’re auto-invested; these are estimated to be \~$5K.
* This is comprised of my base pay, annual bonus, a Q4 performance award, HYSA + CD interest, annual parking lease payments (I have a parking spot I rent out because I don’t need a car in the NYC area), side gig income (social media, dog walking), and gifts from my parents for my birthday and Christmas.

# Expenses: $38,416.95

**Taxes: $13,173.93** 💸 

* Property Taxes: $10,966.03 - This is actually lower than previous years as I successfully got a firm to file a property tax appeal which reduced the valuation of my condo, and that reduction was also applied retroactively for the last 2 quarters of 2023!
* Federal Taxes: $2,084 - Paid in February to the government when I filed my taxes for the previous year.
* Turbotax: $123.90 - Paid when filing my federal and state returns.

**Home: $9,487.97** 🏠 

* HOA Dues: $5,209.99 - Covers maintenance, water/sewage, and garbage.
* Home Services: $1,917.04 - Had some upkeep in my condo this year that included replacing my 9+ year old kitchen faucet, replacing the over-the-range microwave, fixing a closet door, painting two of my office walls, painting my window frames to keep with HOA code, etc.
* Home Insurance: $767
* Home Supplies: $699.69 - This is mostly Amazon purchases over the year so not all of these should be considered essential, but included various storage and cleaning supplies, smartplugs/Alexa/surge protectors, air filters, trash bags, etc. I’m sure I can cut back on these next year and be better about what I end up ordering.
* Furnishings: $214.10 - I started a home decoration project late last year and some rolled into this year! This included bookshelves and a storage drawer from Wayfair.

**Groceries: $5,090.79** 🛒 

* For the most part, I consider myself a frugal shopper but try to give myself some leniency here. Groceries are expensive where I am, and I mitigate the cost by shopping sales and never using a delivery service - I walk to and from the store (exercise and errands!), mostly cook and eat at home, and never order delivery or takeout. Convenience sometimes wins over especially on busier days, so this definitely has a lot of snacks and some frozen meals as well.

**Shopping: $1,796.89** 🛍️ 

* Electronics: $755.12 - I got an iPad and Apple Pencil Pro for myself this year, as well as the new Kindle Paperwhite.
* Clothing: $707.18 - I’ve been trying to cut back on this spending category so am a little disappointed with how much I spent this year, in retrospect. I did need new undergarments, which actually took up most of this spending, as well as some workout clothing which included two tops from Lululemon. I did also make my first purchase from Patagonia as well, so try to think this was more about quality and longevity over cost. I bought more than I planned over Black Friday, but they were things I’d been thinking about for a while, are higher in quality, and I like wearing - so trying not to get too stuck on this!
* Shopping: $334.59 - Unsurprisingly, mostly Amazon purchases here haha. This is a mish mosh of random things, including calendars/planners, stationary, books, etc. In hindsight, not too bad for a year!

**Dining & Drinks: $1,588.16** 🍽️ 

* I don’t drink, so this is all food or coffee!
* Restaurants: $1,461.34 - Because of my social media side gig, I get invited to restaurants in my city and am responsible for leaving gratuity for the staff. I’ll dine out for this on average 2 meals/week. This is largely the tip that I've left this year, with a small handful of other meals out with friends.
* Cafes: $126.82- I met up with friends over coffee (or dessert) this year! Otherwise I make my coffee at home.

**Gifts: $1,434.07** 🎁 

* These were largely gifts for my family: birthdays, Christmas, etc. My younger sister and I will split purchases for our parents so we can get them slightly bigger gifts; these have included an Apple Watch 10 and laptop for our dad, luxury skincare and a purse for our mom, etc.
* I also treated a good friend to a Michelin-starred meal for his birthday this year, and purchased gifts/food for friends for their birthdays as well.

**Utilities: $1,431.23** 💡 

* Gas & Electric: $771.23
* Internet: $660.00
* Cell Phone: Expensed through work

**Fees & Charges: $1,331.37** 💲 

* Service Fees: $ 921.41 - This included my annual $95 AmEx fee as well as what I paid the law firm to successfully appeal my property taxes ($717.91) and file them ($108.50)
* Other Fees & Charges: $409.96 - These include various fees for Adobe Creative Cloud, OneDrive, Quicken, etc.; my annual fee for Amazon Prime of $148.21, as well as $25.05 to my state government for a driver’s license renewal.

**Everything Else: $3,082.54** 💊🚊🏋🏻‍♂️🎥💇🏻‍♀️ 

* Health: $827.35 - This included $460.52 that I paid out of pocket to my dentist for a root canal and crown I had done this year; the majority I covered using my HSA. The remaining spending was on daily supplements and vitamins ($284.62) and pharmacy ($82.21).
* Transportation: $751.25 - This is entirely public transit for the year! Unfortunately my company doesn’t offer a commuter benefit like my previous employers did. I don’t use Uber/Lyft, so otherwise rely on walking to get around.
* Fitness: $685.48 - I started Classpass last summer and have kept it up through this year! I take regular barre classes at my local fitness studio and have definitely felt the physical and mental benefits of it.
* Entertainment: $522.18 - I’ve bucketed my Spotify/Hulu subscription here, as well as costs to a concert I went to ($89.50), tickets to some local events (\~$60), plus some movie theater tickets I got for my sister and me
* Self Care: $296.28 - I consider myself low maintenance haha, but spent $120.24 on a haircut this year, $90 on laundry (my condo building has shared machines), $45.81 on nail polish, and $42.23 on skincare. My skincare is so low as my dad is great about stocking up on Cerave moisturizer and Cetaphil face wash for me at Costco (which he’ll gift to me over Thanksgiving when I go back home) and I have a backlog of products from the year before that I’m working my way through. 

# Conclusion

Overall, this was a good financial year for me! I’m pretty satisfied with my current saving/spending habits as it’s become a focus for me over the last few years. Over the next year, my goals are:

* Cancel my Amazon Prime subscription and only make purchases when I get free shipping (on $35+). Reduce unnecessary/impulse purchases and be more intentional about what I buy. I may look into alternatives like Target as a substitution as well.
* Cut back clothing spending to as close as $0 as possible and buy secondhand if it’s an option.
* Try to embrace spending on things like travel and experiences; I have a lot of guilt/financial anxiety on spending on things in this category, but want to remind myself it’s ok to do so.",11,1735240056.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,3,0.87,False

","My husband (32 M) and I (33 F) have been together since summer of 2020. Been married for 1.5 years now. 

I’m so confused and just don’t know if I can trust the way I’m feeling or if I’m being overdramatic/sensitive/selfish or what. I have a therapy appt scheduled in the new year to help me work through my feelings. 

But I just feel like I need to get this all out because there is no one I can really talk to right now .. I do my best not to discuss marital issues with friends and family because 1) it’s unfair to my husband, and 2) it puts my friends/family in an awkward position. 

My husband is not a bad person by any means. He has a ton of patience, is very supportive of me, and is slow to anger. He’s loyal and kind to me.

When I bring things up to him in terms of my needs not being met, most of the time he makes an effort to try to change (at least for a little while). Example: I wanted him to be more chivalrous toward me - I explained some of the ways he could do that, such as paying for dates when we are out, opening up the car door for me, bringing me coffee in the morning. 
He does all of these things, in rotation. Nothing outside of the rotation though. He does not think creatively or outside the box in that sense .. just not the most romantic guy I suppose.

We split household bills 50/50 or close to it. He e-transfers our monthly rent to landlords. I pay for our our power, phone/internet, and groceries. I also do the majority of cooking/cleaning/meal prep and am the one who books all of our appointments. We both work full time or close to it - he’s an electrician, I’m a nurse.

Some of the issues that bother me are that we just don’t seem to have much in common. The majority of our conversation revolves around finance and paying off our debt, getting a house, maybe having kids. Not much much else. I love spirituality, philosophy, thinking about the future and how to make life meaningful, etc .. he is kind of more of a take it day by day, moment by moment kind of guy. The main question he asks is “what are we doing for supper tonight?” Kinda thing..

He is a very non touchy feely type, but I love physical affection and intimacy as it makes me feel loved and appreciated. 

His love languages: 1) quality time, 2) acts of service
My love languages: 1) acts of service, 2) physical touch

I’ve mentioned several times before how important physical touch is to me .. but it never seems to fully get through to him or if he tries to make a change, it only lasts for a short while. His idea of giving me what I want for physical touch is essentially being the “little spoon” and allowing me to cuddle him for a bit. He will hold my hand in public. He will give me a peck/kiss when he’s home from work (the kind of kiss you might give your mom or sister, mind you..). 

In terms of sex .. pretty infrequent. maybe once or twice a month on average? During and after sex he acts like he is completely beat, and too tired to help me get off too. Or he will say “want me to do anything for you?” To which I usually reply “no,” as id feel guilty considering how hard and heavy he’s breathing and how tired/exhausted he is acting from our 10 minutes of sex.
If he had it his way - he would lay back, “starfish” and let me do everything for him .. which I use to do, often, but don’t anymore. I just put my own needs and desires to the side and say “it’s okay” and tell him I’m glad he enjoyed himself. The sex is not stellar at all by any means. I’m almost just not even interested in sex with him anymore. I don’t even want his daily “home from work” kiss anymore, because it means nothing to me. Lately I’m at the point where I couldn’t be bothered about being touched by him anymore, which is crazy because in the past, his lack of physical affection towards me would bring me to actual tears of frustration/desperation. 

To me sex and physical intimacy has always been crucial to any romantic relationship.. it’s a way to feel a deep and special type of intimacy that you don’t experience with other people you love, just that one person. I use to tell myself that it was so high in importance to me that if sexual compatibility wasn’t there, it’d be a relationship dealbreaker. Yet, here I am .. married to someone who I have such little to no sexual chemistry with..

I also wish he liked a bit of adventure from time to time, but it’s not really his thing. I do almost all of the planning of dates and activities. He could truly care less and would be more than content to lie in bed all day, order food and watch TV/play video games. I’m almost bored to tears. If I plan something, he will come along .. but he is sort of just the “tag along” kinda guy/partner, with not much actual contribution to the activity besides showing up. If I didn’t plan dates I think we’d never leave the house, except to go to work. 
I just wish he would take an actual interest in other things and get excited about something. Like “hey babe, let’s go camping!” Or “have you ever tried ice skating - let’s check it out?” Or “there’s a new restaurant in town - let me take you there for supper tonight.” Absolutely none of these things … his idea of coming up with a date night is going for dinner (usually at a restaurant that he likes and has been to many times before), followed by a walk around the neighbourhood after. Don’t get me wrong, that kind of thing is okay but…. It’s pretty low effort imo. 

I very much feel like the nurturing mother type to him, and I really don’t want to be. I am submissive by nature, but I’d rather do these things for a man who I actually feel like is taking care of me.. like he deserves to be treated and spoiled by me. Many women want to do these things naturally for a man when they feel like their needs are being met in even in the most minimal ways, I mean jeez…

This all being said, I feel guilty and like the love I have for him is conditional in a way. I just feel totally checked out. I can’t even pretend. I have been thinking about divorce and being single what feels like a dangerous amount lately. I don’t even know how to bring all of this ip to him. He doesn’t seem to really notice or care that I’ve been distancing myself and putting less effort in.

Hydrogen peroxide. That familiar brown bottle lurking in your medicine cabinet. We’ve all used it for scrapes and cuts, but what about swishing it around in our mouths? It’s a practice that’s gained traction as a DIY remedy for bad breath, but is it really a good idea? Let’s dive deep into the bubbling world of hydrogen peroxide mouth rinse and bad breath, exploring the science, the benefits, and the potential pitfalls. We’ll separate fact from fiction and arm you with the knowledge you need to make informed decisions about your oral health. So, buckle up, because we’re about to embark on a journey into the fascinating chemistry of fresh breath!

Hydrogen Peroxide Mouth Rinse Bad Breath: A Deep Dive
-----------------------------------------------------

Before we get into the nitty-gritty, let's lay some groundwork. Understanding the *why* behind bad breath (also known as halitosis) is crucial to tackling it effectively. Bad breath often stems from volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) produced by bacteria feasting on food particles and dead cells in your mouth. Think of it like a microscopic compost heap, emitting unpleasant odors. Now, where does hydrogen peroxide fit into this picture? Well, it’s an oxidizing agent, meaning it can break down these VSCs, effectively neutralizing the stink. Sounds promising, right? But hold your horses, because there's more to the story.

### The Science Behind the Fizz

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) works its magic through oxidation. Imagine it like a tiny, bubbly Pac-Man gobbling up those smelly VSC molecules. This chemical reaction neutralizes the odor, leaving your breath temporarily fresher. However, this seemingly simple process has a few caveats. The concentration of hydrogen peroxide matters greatly. The 3% solution you find in drugstores is typically diluted for mouthwash use, but even then, it can be too harsh for some.

### Benefits of Hydrogen Peroxide Mouth Rinse for Bad Breath

So, does hydrogen peroxide mouth rinse actually work for bad breath? Under certain circumstances, yes. It can provide temporary relief from halitosis, especially if the cause is a build-up of bacteria. Think of it as a quick fix, not a long-term solution.

- **Short-term odor control:** Like a breath mint on steroids, hydrogen peroxide can knock out bad breath quickly, making it handy for those unexpected close encounters.
- **Potential antibacterial effect:** It can kill some of the bacteria responsible for producing VSCs, although this effect is temporary.
- **Whitening properties:** A side benefit of using hydrogen peroxide mouthwash is its potential to whiten teeth, although this should be approached with caution (more on that later).

### Risks and Precautions of Using Hydrogen Peroxide as a Mouthwash

Now for the less glamorous side of the story. While hydrogen peroxide can offer temporary relief from bad breath, it’s not without its risks. Using it incorrectly or too frequently can lead to some unpleasant side effects.

- **Tooth sensitivity:** One of the most common complaints is increased tooth sensitivity. This is because hydrogen peroxide can erode tooth enamel, exposing the sensitive dentin underneath. Ouch!
- **Gum irritation:** The bubbling action, while satisfying, can irritate delicate gum tissues, leading to redness, swelling, and even bleeding.
- **Disruption of oral microbiome:** Just like antibiotics, hydrogen peroxide doesn't discriminate between good and bad bacteria. Overuse can disrupt the delicate balance of your oral microbiome, potentially leading to other oral health issues.
- **""Black hairy tongue"":** Although rare, this unsettling condition can occur with prolonged hydrogen peroxide use. It's characterized by a dark, furry appearance on the tongue, caused by changes in the tongue's papillae. Sounds delightful, doesn't it?

### Hydrogen Peroxide Mouth Rinse Bad Breath: The Right Way to Use It

""SECRET of Fresh breath https://freepage.pro/samutores/freshbreath""

If you're determined to try hydrogen peroxide for bad breath, it’s vital to do it correctly. Here's the lowdown:

1. **Dilution is key:** Never use undiluted 3% hydrogen peroxide. Mix it with equal parts water to create a 1.5% solution.
2. **Swish, don't gargle:** Gently swish the solution around your mouth for 30 seconds to a minute, then spit it out. Don't swallow!
3. **Rinse thoroughly:** Afterward, rinse your mouth thoroughly with plain water to remove any residual hydrogen peroxide.
4. **Infrequent use:** Don’t make this a daily habit. Limit use to a few times a week, and only when necessary.
5. **Consult your dentist:** Before adding hydrogen peroxide to your oral hygiene routine, talk to your dentist. They can assess your specific situation and advise on the best course of action.

Hydrogen Peroxide Mouth Rinse Bad Breath: Alternatives and Long-Term Solutions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember, hydrogen peroxide is a temporary fix, not a cure for chronic bad breath. Addressing the underlying cause is essential for lasting fresh breath. Here are some more sustainable solutions:

- **Good oral hygiene:** Brushing and flossing twice a day are the cornerstones of fresh breath. Don’t forget to brush your tongue!
- **Stay hydrated:** Drinking plenty of water helps wash away food particles and keeps your mouth moist, inhibiting bacterial growth.
- **Sugar-free gum and mints:** Chewing sugar-free gum stimulates saliva production, which helps neutralize acids and wash away debris.
- **Regular dental checkups:** Your dentist can identify and address any underlying dental issues contributing to bad breath, such as gum disease or cavities.
- **Dietary changes:** Limiting foods like garlic, onions, and coffee can help minimize breath odor.

Hydrogen Peroxide Mouth Rinse Bad Breath: A Final Word
------------------------------------------------------

So, is hydrogen peroxide mouth rinse a good solution for bad breath? Well, it's complicated. While it can offer temporary relief, it carries potential risks and isn't a substitute for proper oral hygiene and regular dental care. Think of it as a last resort, not your go-to solution. If you're struggling with persistent bad breath, don't play guessing games. Talk to your dentist. They can help you identify the root cause and develop a personalized treatment plan. After all, a healthy smile is more than just fresh breath; it's a reflection of overall well-being. Wouldn’t you agree?

""SECRET of Fresh breath https://freepage.pro/samutores/freshbreath""

**Conclusion:**

Hydrogen peroxide can be a useful tool in combating bad breath, but it's essential to use it wisely and with caution. By understanding the science behind its effectiveness, acknowledging its potential risks, and employing proper usage techniques, you can harness its benefits while minimizing any negative impacts on your oral health. Always remember that consistent oral hygiene, a healthy diet, and regular dental check-ups are the foundation of truly fresh breath and optimal oral health.

I (27F) have been dating my boyfriend “Jacob” (25M) for almost five years now. A few days ago, we attended a neighbor’s holiday party together. At said party, Jacob became violently ill. He was vomiting and extremely dizzy. In total, we couldn’t leave our neighbor’s house for about 3 hours, due to him being physically unable to walk or stand up (because of the intense dizziness, which was causing him to vomit).

Everyone in attendance, myself included, assumed that this situation was caused by Jacob drinking too much. Alcohol was flowing freely at the party, and he was partaking. I was not closely monitoring what he was drinking, but have pieced together that he likely consumed the following over the course of 3-4 hours. His body weight is about 180 lbs if that helps for determining the realisticness of his later claims.
- 3 bottles of hard cider
- 1 Irish coffee
- Unknown quantity of whisky, possibly up to 1/3 of a fifth (750 ml bottle). He was mixing this into his ciders.
- [Bonus: he had 1 glass of beer with lunch, about 3 hours before the party.]

In the days following this incident, I’ve had several hard conversations with Jacob. He did apologize at first. But as the days have gone on, he revealed to me that he feels the sickness was not caused by drinking too much. He insists that for him, this wasn’t really “a lot” to drink. He has developed two alternate theories as to why this happened.

- Theory 1: “he had food poisoning”. About 3 hours before the party, we split a single large pizza for lunch. Since I experienced no symptoms of food poisoning, despite eating literally off the same plate as him, I don’t think this was the cause. He tried going further back, but the last time he ate a meal that I didn’t also eat was dinner the night before the party (more than 24 hours prior to him starting to puke).

- Theory 2: “his stomach was too full”. He didn’t eat anything at the party, and he now claims this was because his stomach was hurting due to eating a large amount of greasy pizza. He says possibly his stomach was too full and he shouldn’t have had anything to drink because he already wasn’t feeling good. This also doesn’t make a lot of sense to me, since all that food should have moderated the effects of the alcohol, not made it worse.

I am starting to get the feeling that these “theories” are a way for Jacob to shirk responsibility for his actions. He even used the exact phrase “it feels like I was set up”, meaning some other factor made him sick, causing it to appear like he was drinking too much even though he really wasn’t. I don’t think that’s the case, but I am seeking clarity from the internet. I don’t often drink, and don’t know if the above drinks listing is “way too much” or “a normal amount” for someone of Jacob’s age and size. I do know I have seen him drink at parties like this many times before, and he has NEVER gotten to the point of vomiting or extreme dizziness.

Could this all have been caused by something other than alcohol? Or is he trying to pull one over on me?

Spoiler: might be a long post. And trigger warnings.

On a daily basis I go to a Cafe after my office hours along with my friend. The cafe is on road side and the road is also quite busy. The cafe is also surrounded by 3-4 shops that were open at that time(it was 6.48PM).

There's a parking just in front of the cafe where i park my car regaularly and wait for my order in the car. As soon as i did my order for a coffee from the app.

While, i was waiting for my order, i was looking towards entrance of cafe as my expectation of the drink i ordered being served by the staff. But, i saw a girl, from her looks it looked she was 22-26 years old. Lets call her V, V came out of the cafe and waited 5-6 steps from its entrance. Then a boy(B) came out and she started walking away from cafe along with him.

Since, they(B,V) were customers and were not staff i started using my phone in the car and was chatting with my friend about our daily shts. Just after 2, 3 minutes, i heard some one screaming and noticed it was a girl screaming. The screams were quite loud, that even when i was listening 150BPM music in my car, i could clearly hear them coming from the market complex's first floor. 

I glanced on the first floor and saw that B was standing towards 1st floor railings and was facing towards a door, where the screams were coming out. Since B was out and the door seemed to be locked as B was knocking it looked like that V was in some kind of physical trouble. But, for the next two minutes V's screams went on increasing in intensity as if she was fighting for her life. Me and friend stepped out of car and few others gathered on the ground and saw that girl opened the door and B went in and locked. I asked the neighbouring shop owner about that room, he told it was cafe's toilet and it's always locked and its key had to be taken from the cafe's staff.

Since, i am familiar with all of the staff due to me being a regular there. I went inside cafe and asked about the toilet's key, and manager said - "" Sir, wo couple gya hai g key lekar upar"". There was a female staff also, i requested the manager to send the female staff and take notice of the situation by going up.
Immediately, that female staff girl, went upstairs and started knocking. During all this that girl, even with that door locked was screaming like it was life being snatched away by some devil in the horror movies. Me and my friend were utterly confused and ran through the situation if V was physically harassed or maybe be sexually assualted by someone. 
That female staff knocked continuously for like 10 minutes, with screams still coming out and finally B partially opened the door and shared words with the female staff and in next minute the female staff went in, after 2 minutes the screams stopped. After 5 minutes B came out, while V and that female staff still inside and locked. Now, screams started again for like 20 seconds and then stopped. V went inside the cafe and took some belongings put them inside his Baleno. And asked for directions from the manager for a hospital/medical store and started walking in the told direction by the manager.

The manager was right beside, my car and i asked him about the V's situation and he said, female staff reported of menstural bleeding, leaving V in shock and hence screaming was happening. Listening to this me and my friend were then little bit relaxed as we didn't sensed any foul play there and it turned out that the situation was medical. 

Later 10 mins, B came back with some medication like pads, cotton and stuff. Went inside that toilet.

I asked the manager again as he was waiting right beside my car, and he told that V suffered from a miscarriage. Me and my friend were totally out of brain now, how could this happen here and initially when i looked at V when she came out she was wearing baggy clothes but didn't looked pregnant. Later, 5 minutes, B came out of the toilet carrying V in his arms and i could look V's lower was wet and bloody. And he put V in his car. The female staff and the manager also stepped inside the car and took V to hospital.

After 10 minutes I left, and then next day i came back and asked manager about, what happened to V. Manager said - ""Wo ladka, usko koi 10Km durr kisi hopsital mein le jana chaha rha tha, to mein aur female staff beech mein he utar gaye"" - (manager and female staff were dropped midway due to B taking V to a hospital far away, as they also needed to come back to the store). Manager, also said, B mixed something in V's coffee as B didn't allowed staff to serve the coffee as B himself served coffee by taking it from the counter. And due to it V was screaming inside that toilet.

After all this, me and my friend blamed ourselves that we didn't called the police. Still after 9 days V's screams are there in my head and I couldn't figure out if i did wrong by not calling the police. As the situation was so unique, me and my friend haven't witnessed anything like that in our life, so we couldn't think straight at that time.

Now, i can hope and pray only if V is okay 🙏🙏🙏

Edit: Today, the same female staff member served my drink and i asked her if she took V's contact, she said, no, she didn't take here contact. And said V was pleading her not to leave alone with B. Even, after that she left her with B.",12,1735238901.0,AskIndianWomen,17,0.93,False

1hmuwoz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hmuwoz,I Need More Ideas & Suggestions!!!,"First, thank you to everyone who took their time to help me out with ideas for my living room!!!


Some updates:

— got rid of our black leather couches
— got a beige upholstered L couch!!!
— moved our old rug back in (temporarily)
— ordered longer & warmer curtains (cafe brown color, hopefully they compliment the space. we plan to have the curtains across the entire wall too)
— ordered a frosting kit for our French doors glass for privacy


My goal is to first complete the more cost efficient things such as wall art & new hardware/paint for the French doors before committing to a new 9x12 rug & coffee table, which is a lot more $$$. (but then again, am I going backwards because should I be getting the expensive bits first then decorating around them?????)


Lastly (questions part):


— What color to paint the French Doors?
they have been this color since we moved into our home, so it’s NOT the same color as the wall. 

— What Art to put between the window & doors? 
some of you have suggested bigger + b&w. 

— What kind of Coffee Table?
leaning towards a round wooden one but correct me please!

— Rug Suggestions!!!
I think we need a 9x12, because we currently have a 8x11 & even though it’s a little off centered, I think it’s a bit too small?

— Possibly Light Fixture suggestions for our table?
I think we need a bigger one? I know it has to be lowered a bit but we definitely need one with at least 2 bulbs, 3 would be ideal.

— Window Treatment for the Bay Window!!!
I’ve been stumped on what to get for this area.. it’s a HUGE window & you can definitely see us from the outside, especially once it gets dark.

I have started a delivery-only cafe in Bangalore as an early experiment to understand the feasibility, taste and potential of opening something bigger.

The focus will be on specialty coffee and high-quality ingredients at a reasonable cost, with low overheads and no compromise on quality.

The coffees are sourced from 7000Steps, I truly believe in the rise of NE Indian coffees and their potential.

In addition to the coffee, the milk is sourced from Akshay Kalpa, tonic water from Sepoy/Mossant, and oat milk from Alt Co.

(M22) (F20),"Keep in mind I’m not trying to bash her in any way or form, I thought she was a honest good person but what she did for me to end things with her honestly traumatized me. Prior to breaking up we were dating for almost two years. We started off our relationship very bad and we were both toxic for each other. It didn’t start getting better until summer where we had time away from each other and we learned how to communicate. She would always be there for me and seemed to truly love me. As the months went by we would fight at least once a week. I was homeless during this time and it was tough because I didn’t tell her. We kept trying to find solutions to stop fighting and we would be on and off, fight one week be cool for three and back and forth. During the times we didn’t fight were the best, but when we did hurt a lot because during this time I was truly exhausted and trying to be patient which ultimately helped me become a more patient person. She would always be the one yelling in every argument and she would always play the victim and I would always make it her excuse because she is a girl and I don’t know what she was going through (which is dumb to think now because no matter who you are or what happens, it is never an excuse to treat someone mean or rude). Fast forward another couple months we decided to move in together because we were both in college and it would just be a cheaper option for us to live together. We moved in and it seemed okay for awhile. Less fighting and more of a personal connection. I tried to do my best with cleaning and cooking everyday but I was the only one working and doing school and she just was doing school. There would be some days where work and school was so long that I wouldn’t want to wash clothes or I wouldn’t want to wash the dishes and she would be furious. She would always tell me how I’m lazy and how she’s tired too and I would just talk to her and she would just always blow up. She would just take it to the extreme and it sucked cause I would 7 hours and then I have to go to class for 3 I’m pretty beat and coming home to that was never fun. More time passes and I decided that I wanted to go on my dream vacation to Fiji because it was my bday. She was all for it and it seemed we were going to be good! But once we started getting closer to the trip she would just be more rude and snappy to me always saying mean things that she would never say. I’m not a sensitive person but to hear the person that is supposed to love you and be there for you just always give you crap isn’t the best feeling. So we go on the trip and the entire time I was getting accused of cheating on her and how I’m gonna leave her once we go back home and it was just on and on and on and it got to the point where I just didn’t even want to be on the trip and just go home. The week goes by and we are at the airport and even at the airport she was just being so rude and she was thinking it was funny and all that and I was just mentally checked out. I still wanted to try but I would keep talking to her on why this is happening and she would always blame it on things that didn’t even correlate with why she was doing that. We land home and it was very distant between us because I was tired, I didn’t want to be next to her and I didn’t want to even sleep next to her. There more but I still want to keep some things private for now but two weeks go by and things were starting to be better because we talked and in my mind she heard how I felt and vice versa. So one day she wanted to go study at a coffee shop alone, she tries to go but it’s blocked off because of some festival so she calls me and tells me she’s coming home (coffee shop is not even 10 min away) and she ask if I would be able to make her food rq and I said yes. So I get out of bed and I just had to go to the bathroom (💩) and so I go to the bathroom for about the duration of her driving back home and as soon as I get out the room to the kitchen she walks in and she just looks so mad because I didn’t start making her food and so she drops her backpack and starts grabbing everything very aggressively and I’m right there telling her like hey sorry I was in the bathroom etc., and she’s just quiet and she just starts to blank stare at the wall and starts to cry. So as a concerned partner who cares for my partner I try to check in on her and I gently put my hand on her back and I asked her if she was okay and she threw her self on to the fridge and started saying to not touch her like that and to not hit her and my heart honestly sank. I was pure fear cause I knew what she was doing and all I could think about in that moment was she is going to call the cops and say I hit her. I immediately grabbed the necessities I needed and I left to my grandmas house. As I was driving I called my mom and dad to tell  them what happened because I didn’t know what she was going to do. Since then I have broken up with her and it just has been hurting me because even though we would fight and we began our relationship with fighting I loved her with every ounce of my heart. I truly wanted to be her husband and for her to be my wife and to have a family with her. I know she didn’t love me and she must’ve been planning this all along because she kinda stopped paying her part of the rent which I come to find out that she is going to study abroad. She has also been going out and just seeming like this relationship wasn’t anything to her which sucks to know and think that because I truly thought this relationship was the one. I’ve been going to the gym and I have deleted social media but I still can’t wrap my head around how someone will lie and sit there and tell you that they love you but will be willing to ruin your life based off lies. I don’t wish any harm in her and I truly pray that she is okay and will be safe but I am just still hurt and feel betrayed. ",0,1735238199.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False

Oral health issues can be a persistent annoyance—bad breath, gum discomfort, and weak enamel are not exactly confidence boosters.

These problems often trace back to toxins and oxidative stress lurking where you least expect them. 

The [Dentavim](https://theworldhealth.org/dentavim-official) formulation provides an innovative approach to tackling oral health concerns while promoting a fresher, healthier smile.

But ... is it actually any good?

😁

# Personal Experience

Using [Dentavim](https://theworldhealth.org/dentavim-official) quickly became a surprising highlight of my oral care routine. Within the first week, my gums felt less sensitive, and by week two, I noticed a lasting freshness that extended well beyond my usual brushing routine.

Morning coffee breath—a notorious foe—was significantly reduced, much to my partner’s delight.

By week three, I could feel my enamel strengthening. It was like a protective shield forming over my teeth, making crisp apples and icy drinks far more enjoyable.

I had never thought much about how my enamel *felt*, but Dentavim made its presence unmistakable.

The only minor hiccup was the capsules' faint earthy aftertaste—a small quirk that reinforced its natural, plant-based formulation. It wasn’t unpleasant, just a brief reminder of the wholesome ingredients doing their work.

Dentavim has since earned a permanent spot in my daily routine and a couple of my friends have also started using it after I started raving about it.

1hmuiqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/anxiety_support/comments/1hmuiqc/anxiety_triggers_you_didnt_know_you_had_and_how/,Anxiety Triggers You Didn’t Know You Had – And How to Finally Find Peace,"Anxiety is a master of disguise. It creeps in, often unnoticed, and makes itself at home in our lives. You might think you know what triggers your anxiety—stressful work environments, big social gatherings, or financial struggles. But what if I told you some of the most powerful anxiety triggers are hidden in plain sight, sabotaging your peace without you even realizing it?  

I’ve been there. I thought I had my anxiety all figured out. But then, the unexpected happened: subtle, everyday things started spiraling me into a state of panic. These triggers were so sneaky that I didn’t even know they were the problem.  

Let me share a few you might be overlooking:  

### **1. Your Morning Routine (or Lack Thereof)**  
That rushed coffee, scrolling through your phone before you’ve even gotten out of bed, or hitting snooze five times? It sets the tone for a chaotic day. A disorganized morning fuels anxiety, leaving you playing catch-up instead of taking control.  

### **2. “Harmless” Scrolling on Social Media**  
Ever find yourself comparing your life to someone’s curated highlight reel? Even if it’s subconscious, this constant comparison game is a breeding ground for self-doubt and anxiety.  

### **3. Clutter in Your Environment**  
Your brain craves order. Messy spaces can make it feel like you’re living in chaos, triggering low-grade anxiety that builds over time.  

### **4. Caffeine and Hidden Stimulants**  
Caffeine may be your best friend in the morning, but it’s often an anxiety wolf in sheep’s clothing. Even “decaf” coffee and chocolate can sneak in stimulants that make your heart race and mind spiral.  

### **5. Unspoken Boundaries with Loved Ones**  
Relationships can be a significant source of hidden anxiety. People-pleasing, saying “yes” when you want to say “no,” or avoiding difficult conversations—it all adds up and eats away at your mental health.  

### **6. Nutritional Gaps You Don’t Know About**  
Here’s a tough one: many of us don’t realize how much our diet affects our mental state. Missing key nutrients, like magnesium or B vitamins, can quietly wreak havoc on your mood and anxiety levels.  

### **So, What’s the Solution?**  
Once I uncovered these triggers, I knew I needed something more than just mindfulness apps and deep breathing. I needed a formula to support my mental health from the ground up—a way to regain control without feeling overwhelmed.  

That’s when I moved on **[The Anti-Anxiety Formula](https://anxiety-formula.com/)**. This science-backed approach gave me the tools to take charge of my anxiety by addressing the hidden triggers at their core.  

### **Why This Could Be a Game-Changer for You**  
This isn’t just another trendy wellness hack. It’s a comprehensive system designed to target anxiety from multiple angles, including nutrition, habits, and mindset shifts. It’s helped me—and countless others—finally feel like ourselves again.  

If you’re tired of feeling like anxiety controls your life, I highly recommend checking it out. Even if you’ve tried everything, this could be the missing piece you didn’t know you needed.  

### **Your Turn**  
Have you ever discovered an anxiety trigger that completely caught you off guard? Let’s talk about it in the comments—you might help someone else uncover their hidden stressors.  

Take control. You’re stronger than your anxiety. And if you need help along the way, don’t be afraid to reach out for the right tools to support you.",3,1735237656.0,anxiety_support,1,0.8,False

1hmui2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hmui2s/aitah_for_stopping_some_christmas_games_after_my/,AITAH for stopping *some* Christmas games after my furniture was dented repeatedly,"Ok so my husband (30yo male) and I (29 year old female) hosted Christmas this year and put in a lot of effort. I made filet mignon, rice, garlic roasted greeb beans, parmeasan crusted potatoes, garlic shrimp, lasagna and a ton of appetizers! I hand embroidered everyones linen napkins with christmas trees to decorate the table and overall put in a lot of effort to make everything look nice for my family. My husband was in charge of putting together some games for everyone (games are usually our responsibility anyway). He found some games online called the Reeindeer Olympics so we got all the supplies for those and on Christmas Eve (since we celebrate that day) we started to play after eating the appetizers. We played the first few games and everyone was having a nice time but we stopped because my sisters kid wanted to play with the supplies (a bowl and some cotton balls) since he was in a bad mood for most of the night and suddenly was happy so she wanted him to stay happy. We understood and it wasn’t a problem at all so we paused on the games and did other Christmas stuff. My sister (34yo F) makes my husband dress up as Santa so while everyone is upstairs enjoying themselves, we both go downstairs and rush putting on the outfit, wrap the presents, dip his shoes in flour and stamp his boots up and down the stairs so it looks real(all per my sisters instructions while her husband (35 yo m) is on the couch doing absolutely nothing. Everything went well and her two boys believed it so success and then after we all decided that we would open the gifts and after everyone was too tired to play the games and the boys went to bed. The next morning my husband and I start cleaning up and we notice that our coffee table has atleast twenty deep dents in it because my cousin (26 yo f) went too aggressive with one of the games. For background information- the game was to scoop cotton balls with a spoon into a bowl blindfolded. We had 7 people play the game and NO ONE played it so aggressively as my cousin did, everyone even made jokes about how she was being insane. We have joked our entire lives that she’s super rough and has no idea to be gentle, when hitting you or walking she does everything very forcefully. 

So after seeing the damage I was pretty sad because my dad made me that coffee table. Its not fancy or super expensive but I like it. I decided that we wouldn’t continue the games today for that reason and also because my sister and her husband wouldnt be there for Christmas day so we wouldnt have enough people to continue the olypics because the next few games are team sports. 

When my cousin came I showed her the damage joking around and said the olympics were cancaled but that we could play other games like ticket to ride or card games and she immediately responded “well its your fault for giving me a metal spoon” and “how do you know it was me?”. There was 0 apology or sign of even caring that she had damaged something of mine. I ignored it since it was Christmas day and I didn’t want to turn it into a fight. 

Around 7:30pm that night my sister and her husband came over after spending the day with her inlaws because I told them we were making some more butter shrimp and we could heat up the leftovers if they wanted food. They came and my sister asked how the Olympics went and my cousin told her that we canceled because the coffee table was damaged. My sister has a super strong reaction to that and said that I was punishing my 26 year old cousin for something that was my fault because I should have told her to be more careful before playing the game…. I said something along the lines of “its not my responsibility to tell an adult to be careful with someone’s furniture.” The my sister brought up the fact that about a week ago I accidentally broke one of her new dining chairs and she didn’t get upset. My husband explained to her that was completely different because immediately after breaking her chair I apologized multiple times and told them I’d buy them a new one no questions asked. She didn’t care to understand the differences so I dropped it and continue to let her judge me infront of my entire family. 

A few minutes later my cousin (same one who damaged my table) starts talking to loudly, basically yelling and my sister gets upset and says something like “if you wake up my children im gonna kill you” and my husband uses the opportunity to say “well why are you blaming her? Its your fault for not telling her to speak quietly” — basically something along those lines to try and point out her hypocrisy and she visibly gets upset and said something back with attitude. At this point im trying my hardest to just regulate my anger because I don’t know how we managed to have such a nice day and within 45 minutes of my sister being there there was a fight about something that didn’t affect her. 

Btw the reeindeer olympics had three prizes, 1st place $30 target gift card, 2nd $20 and 3rd place $10 gift card that we paid for but after having our table damaged I didn’t feel like goving these people more money on top of the very nice gifts we already got them, plus all the food and drink for two whole days. 

Once my sister left my mom went in on me about how I ruined Christmas and no one feels comfortable in my house because i was upset someone ruined my furniture. I couldn’t handle the hypocrisy from her because growing up we couldnt even do our homework on the dining room table because we would leave imprints of notebooks or writing. There’s more examples of that so I could go on forever but you get the idea.

1hmugqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1hmugqg/the_headcount/,The Headcount ,"We were seven when we left for Blackwood Trail. Seven friends who'd known each other since high school, who'd done this camping trip every summer for the past five years. I know because I counted us while loading the cars: Mike and Sarah in his Subaru, Chris and Jessica in her hybrid, and me, Tom, and Rachel in my trusty old van. Seven sleeping bags, seven camping chairs, seven headlamps. I always count our gear—it's kind of my thing.

The first hint something was wrong came during dinner. I was serving chili from the big pot, counting scoops like always. ""Eight bowls,"" I muttered, setting down the ladle. ""Did someone take seconds already?""

""Nope, just got mine,"" said Mike, holding up his still-full bowl. Everyone else shook their heads.

I recounted. Eight bowls of chili, still steaming in the cool evening air. But when I looked around the fire, there were just the seven of us, same as always. I must have miscounted—the shadows from the fire were playing tricks on my eyes.

That night, Rachel asked if anyone had seen her blue fleece. ""Check by Jessica,"" Tom said. ""She was wearing one earlier.""

""No, I brought my red one,"" Jessica replied from across the fire.

""Really? Could've sworn I saw you in blue when we were gathering firewood,"" Tom insisted.

Jessica shrugged. ""Maybe it was Sarah?""

""Green hoodie all day,"" Sarah called out.

We found Rachel's fleece the next morning, hung neatly on a tree branch. She swore she'd checked there three times the night before.

The second day, we went hiking. I did my usual headcount as we set out: Mike and Sarah up front, Chris and Jessica in the middle, Tom and Rachel behind them, me bringing up the rear. Seven.

But when we stopped for water an hour in, I counted eight water bottles being passed around. Eight distinct conversations happening. Eight pairs of boots leaving tracks in the mud. Yet every time I focused on any one person, they were exactly who they should be—people I'd known for years, wearing what they'd packed, saying things that made sense.

That night, we told ghost stories around the fire. Chris was in the middle of a good one about a haunted highway when I noticed the extra s'more. Eight perfectly toasted marshmallows, eight squares of chocolate, eight graham crackers broken precisely in half. I dropped mine in the fire.

""You okay?"" Rachel asked. ""You look pale.""

""How many of us are here?"" I asked suddenly.

Everyone looked around the fire. ""Seven,"" they said in unison. And they were right—I could see seven people, seven faces I knew as well as my own. But when I closed my eyes, I could hear eight voices answering.

The third day was worse. Eight plates at breakfast. Eight chairs in our circle. Eight sets of footprints leading to the bathroom trench. But still only seven people, seven friends, seven names I could list without thinking. No one else seemed to notice anything wrong. Every time I tried to count higher than seven, my thoughts would slide away like water.

That night, I couldn't sleep. The sound of eight people breathing in seven tents kept me awake. I unzipped my tent and counted the others by flashlight: one, two, three, four, five, six. Seven tents total, just like there should be.

But as I turned to go back inside, my light caught something. A thin line of zipper, hanging in mid-air about five feet off the ground. As I watched, it slowly pulled open, revealing a darkness deeper than the night around it. From inside came the sound of breathing—familiar breathing, breathing I'd heard around countless campfires and movie nights and road trips.

I ran. Threw myself into my tent and buried my head in my sleeping bag like a kid hiding from monsters. In the morning, there were eight breakfast bars missing from our food bag. Eight camp chairs had morning dew on them. Eight people answered ""here"" when I called out ""Who wants coffee?""

But we were seven. We've always been seven. I know because I count, I always count, I have to count. Even now, months later, sitting in my apartment, I still count things obsessively. The plates in my cabinet. The hangers in my closet. The toothbrushes in my bathroom.

There are two toothbrushes in my bathroom. I live alone.

I think.

I should count again, just to be sure.",2,1735237502.0,creepypasta,0,0.76,False

I only roleplay with people at least 21(I'm 24). All characters will be 18+.

Hey! I'm Demon, nice to meet you. I'm replaying RE8 and it's given me the itch to write in that verse now, as if I couldn't be any more mean to my OCs.  I do have some plot ideas to share, and I'd love to hear yours as well. Plotting and world-building is a huge deal with me. I like to write in 3rd-person/past tense, and I like a comfortable 3-7 paragraphs. I tend to try to match my partner, so I can also go up to novella length for someone who does the same. My starters also tend to run longer.

Though our plot is still to be decided, I will be a bit particular about what I want from our roleplay. My character would not be a helpless sort starting out because he grew up in the village and can look out for himself... at least until the monsters descend on his home. I'm comfortable with violence, blood, scare tactics, some gore, hurt/comfort themes, manipulation, etc. It's not a stroll in the flower park here. However, I also love a good romance story and would totally ship my boy Beck with Karl. ERP is an option, pending further discussion about likes and boundaries. Some things I know I don't like are ||non-con, broken bones, any internal gore i.e. eyes/ears/mouth.||

I would like for Beck to become seen as a Lord at some point, and to team up with Karl against Mother Miranda. If you're interested, please feel free to DM me here or on my Discord(coffee.demon022).",1,1735237434.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

Did not for likely over a decade. I smoked DMT a few years ago, ever since leaving my body in that experience it is as if my mind/body/spirit were reawakened to the ability through the sensation being felt again. Anyhow I’d AP maybe once a week after that when completely sober and maybe once a month or two when indulging in marijuana, recently I have not AP’d in maybe 5 months)

SO the past week I’ve had a bunch of amazing moments/ synchronistic happenings and I’ve needed to lock in. Reading everyday, limiting screen time, working out, no fap yada yada. Every time I’d ap before it would be SO hard to control my body at times. Or I’d just be flying so fast. Today? I’d just walk out of my body. I walked outside I was climbing my neighbors trees. It was so real though I deadass didn’t trust I was not actually awake outside. It was really quite awesome. However I got pulled back to my body a couple times due to a very unpleasant sensation. I’ve felt similar before. Typically it’s the roller coaster sensation. I’ve had that also happen so intensely especially around my privates that it feels torturous. Today it was more so like something jumped in my chest and was trying super hard to fuck with my. I momentarily had a paralysis struggled and saw a terrifying entity over me on my bed. Tussling with me and my blankets. I was growling as it’s all I could do. Then I awoke.

After this I closed my eyes again. I’ll share because it was an intensely vivid dream. I thought I was genuinely experiencing this. Driving in my car in the village, everything is as is. I see a brown bear running in the yards to my left. As he approaches a house with about 5 dogs. They begin to fight, I’m shook, I stop in the road. Coolest experience of my life I’m thinking. The bear takes out two dogs… I’m panicking I can’t let these dogs die. One jumps on the bears back. I grab my snow brush(the exact one in my car now) and think I’m going to help them it seems the tide is turning, what is it to live if I’m not willing to live.. and die in this epic battle. I open my door… the bear is gone. I got scared, where could he be? I take a look at the dogs… they’re beat up but alive. I went to the coffee shop as I had to talk about this experience. Then sadly awoke. 
I feel I truly lived this experience and can tell it as a real story… truly what’s the difference ? Anyway… 
I’d appreciate answers and/ or explanation on the sensations I felt. Furthermore I’d like to say certain practices surely improve one’s spiritual “strength” ability to see and move clearly on that side. ",1,1735237403.0,AstralProjection,3,1.0,False

1hmublc,https://www.reddit.com/r/roleplaying/comments/1hmublc/m4f_in_search_of_answersand_each_other/,[M4F] In Search of Answers—and Each Other,"Hi there!

I’ve been roleplaying for several years now. I love diving into realistic, character-driven stories with rich interactions, emotional depth, and a sense of adventure. I typically write in third person and enjoy detailed, immersive storytelling—but I’m all about keeping things fun and flexible!

Here’s an idea I’d love to explore:

The Setting:

We’re two researchers working on an ambitious project in the social sciences—a study that requires us to travel extensively. From bustling cities to remote villages, we’re delving into human behavior, cultural dynamics, or societal issues that require in-depth fieldwork.

I’m the intern, eager to learn and full of questions, while your character is my senior—a seasoned researcher, sharp and confident, but carrying the weight of responsibility.

Through long hours of travel, field interviews, and late nights analyzing data, we build a connection that goes beyond the professional. Whether it’s debating findings, sharing stories over coffee, or navigating unexpected challenges in the field, there’s an undeniable spark between us.

But this connection is complicated. There’s the unspoken tension of our professional hierarchy, the pressure of deadlines, and the unpredictable nature of our work. As we uncover new insights in our research, we might also discover unexpected truths about ourselves—and each other.

What I’m Looking For:

A long-term RP partner (only if we’re a good match!).

Someone who enjoys exploring realistic settings, character dynamics, and a touch of adventure.

No need for long paragraphs every time; I’m all about matching lengths and keeping the story flowing naturally.

Please mention your age and a little about yourself when messaging. For this RP, I’d prefer someone 25+.


If this concept sparks your interest—or if you have ideas of your own to add—let me know! I’d love to craft a meaningful, immersive story with you, full of growth, challenges, and unforgettable moments.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,
(I'm 18+ ans all my characters must be 18+)",1,1735237120.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

First, there was this uncle standing in line behind me, muttering something about ""iPad kids"" and how we can't hold conversations. Dude, we get it, you're from the golden age of social skills. Could you keep your commentary to yourself, though?

Then there was the guy. Oh man, the guy. He had this weird, forced confidence vibe, like he'd just binge-watched motivational YouTube videos and thought he could turn them into real-life charisma. He started talking to this girl in line, and you could feel her discomfort from miles away. But he kept at it, blabbering about coffee, weather, and whatnot. And then—classic—he asked for her number. She gave it to him, probably just to escape the situation, but you could tell she regretted it almost instantly.

Fast forward, and I hear the girl venting to her friend about how this guy has now spammed her on every app known to mankind. WhatsApp, Instagram, Snapchat—he's basically a digital cockroach. She’s blocking him everywhere, looking visibly annoyed. I felt bad for her, but also, maybe don’t give your number to random strangers in line next time? Just saying.

And to top it all off, the Starbucks manager is pacing around like he’s in the middle of an existential crisis, staring at his clipboard and occasionally muttering under his breath. Probably rethinking his entire life and job because this place has turned into a weird social experiment instead of the “cozy community space” it’s supposed to be.

Meanwhile, I’m just trying to sip my overpriced latte in peace. Can I please have one coffee break without being subjected to cringe-worthy life drama? Just one?",1,1735237098.0,pune,5,0.52,False

1hmuagp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1hmuagp/how_to_quit_smoking/,How to quit smoking?,"

For years, I’d wake up to the rasp of my own breath and the bitter taste of yesterday’s cigarettes. Smoking was my companion through late nights, stressful days, and fleeting celebrations. But lately, that comfort had turned on me, becoming a burden I couldn’t ignore.

A week ago, I caught myself wheezing after climbing a single flight of stairs. It wasn’t the first warning sign, but it felt like the loudest. I stared at the half-empty pack on my desk, knowing it wasn’t just cigarettes I was holding onto—it was a habit, a crutch, and maybe even a fear of change.

I didn’t quit right away. That pack still sits there, untouched, like a test of my willpower. Day one, I failed. By day three, I replaced the urge with deep breaths and water. By day five, I started running—well, jogging. My lungs burned like hell, but it wasn’t the same as before. This burn felt like hope.

It hasn’t been easy. The cravings hit like waves, especially during my coffee breaks or when I’m stressed. But I remind myself: every craving is temporary, every cigarette resisted is a small victory. I can breathe easier now—physically and mentally.

I don’t know if I’ll ever stop wanting a smoke, but I’m learning how to want something more: a healthier me, a longer life, and the satisfaction of knowing I didn’t let this habit own me forever.

She and I were close in high school, had sleepovers and similar interests but lost touch after I graduated. I think about her a lot still because I feel like she was a TRUE friend to me. I was always hoping I'd run into her and we could start some kind of new friendship.

She recognized me first and called out to me and we hugged, caught up, etc. I told her I'd love to grab coffee and exchanged phone numbers. I was really excited and worried I came on too strong. But she said she'd love to grab coffee and we parted ways.

I texted her shortly after saying how much I loved seeing her and would still love to grab coffee. She responded to the tune of ""i'd love to, I'll be out of town the next week weeks but we can catch up when I get back."" I was like okay cool just let me know when you are free!

It's now over a month later and I never heard back from her. I'm worried she does not actually want to see me. I really would love to try and be friends with her but I'm not good at this. I have no friends. Can anyone give me advice if it would be weird to text her again? LIke ""happy holidays! i was just thinking about you and hope you and your family have a great holiday. if you're free, I'd still love to grab some coffee or lunch togehter.""

Please give me advice. I do not want to force her into anything. But would it be okay to text her again and ask if she'd like to hang out? On one hand my brain is saying she hates you and doesn't want to hang out, on the other hand I'm like she maybe just forgot

1hmu9gh,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1hmu9gh/humans_are_known_as_the_vague_encyclopedia_based/,"Humans are known as the ""Vague"" Encyclopedia. (Based on random shit I can recall that I'm sure most people do not recall) ","""I cannot find it in the galactic database"" I say in frustration, my claws chipping on the stainless steel table, I scroll through a dozen vague terms of a TV show I vaguely remember seeing when I was younger. 

""GRAAAAAH, I cannot find it"" I shout, exasperated, the other crew members approach me with concern. 

""Uh, need help?"" They ask, pulling out their own datapads. 

""I am looking for a TV show, all I remember is that people placed a thing on their heads and controlled a doll"" 

""Oh so like the human show, Sword Art Online, though which story arc is well.."" 

""No, not Sword Art Online, no permadeath, they were controlling dolls, and I remember pink hair"" 

""That's...very vague, but I think that might have been a Human show"" 

""I know, I asked every human on the ship, and they said they didn't know"" 

""EVERY Human?"" One of them says, raising an antenna 

""Yes, every Human"" I say, trying to not bare my fangs. 

""What about the captain or his deck crew?"" 

The entire room erupts in confusion ""Who would ask them? They are the most stone faced Humans I know, they probably would look at me weird like all the other Humans"" 

""Well if you can't find them, you'll have to apply for Human internet, and you know how heavily guarded that stuff is, even Psychic cults forbid their most devoted from reading a Human mind while browsing Human internet"" 

""I cannot afford Human Internet access. Fine, I'll ask Bridger"" 

I approach Bridger, unlike most Humans, he has a rather spindly build, loves to read physical books, not digital, his room is filled with books you read backwards that confuse me, why can't those books be read normally. 

""Bridger, I ask you for help"" I reluctantly say. 

Bridger crosses his arms and leans on the wall ""Sure, Krork, what can I do for the big man, granted I cannot get you contraband, I can get you extra sleep hours or a hiding spot for personal time but if you want stuff like Alcohol, Chocolate or Coffee to try, which I doubt you can even digest, you'd have to ask Ivan and I doubt even HE would let you try our stimulants"" 

Bridger loved to talk if you were close to him, to have him talk a lot around you means he trusts you, meaning the Humans trust me. 

""No, Bridger, I am searching for a TV show, I believe it is...of the Weeb Variety"" 

""So an Anime? Japanese, Chinese, or even Korean? if it's from Earth anyway"" 

""I believe it is Old Japanese, from the early Human 21st Century, it's animation would be considered primitive but it has it's own charms"" 

""Ok, shoot."" 

""It's a TV show where people wear a contraption on their heads to control avatars to fight"" 

""That's vague, VERY vague, specify further"" 

""Not Sword Art Online, they were piloting small dolls in combat arenas"" 

""Oh...Angelic Layer"" 

I blink my twelve eyes clockwise, which is my species way of showing confusion. 

""Angelic....Layer? I doubt it has something to do with having sexual relations with Divine beings from Human religion"" 

Bridger tilts his head, taking a deep breath as if he just took a blow to the gut ""I don't make the names, I just know what you mean"" 

I type in Angelic Layer, to my surprise, he was right. 

Pink haired small doll piloted by a young girl to fight in a combat arena against what I can remember in the first episode is a dominatrix. 

""How do you know this show?"" 

""The person writing this story was hit with nostalgia browsing the internet"" 

""Ok, there is another show, this time it's western, It involved things akin to viscera without the violence"" 

Bridger pondered, stroking his chin stubble. 

""Do they have megaman arm cannons?"" 

I raise my upper lip, a display of wonder ""Yes, though no lasers, they shot various chemicals"" 

""Grossologists"" 

I type the name, and the TV show I was looking for came up. 

""Ok last one, and this is for my research project, It's about a girl who is adopted"" 

Bridger raises an eyebrow ""By a scowly ruff-n-tuff man with a heart of gold?"" 

""No, not the Witcher, as far as I know that show only had 2 seasons"" 

Bridger nodded, acknowledging my respect for such an awesome franchise. 

""She was adopted by insects"" 

""Growing up Creepie, Not my favorite cartoon, but now I know to clean my room regularly and respect the cleaning droids"" 

I again search up the show, lo and behold, Bridger was right. Creepy girl with abnormal hair colors in a rainbow pattern despite her goth aesthetic raised in a house full of insects who adopted her, an unlikely non-realistic event considering how carnivorous and ruthless Earth Insects are towards their eternal hunger for food. 

I thank Bridger and resume my binge watching of vague Human TV shows. Humans are really good at hearing vague shit and instead hearing specific words. Makes you really respect how far their minds have evolved. ",21,1735236950.0,humansarespaceorcs,4,0.96,False
