1l1izvz,https://i.redd.it/qipt6jjgui4f1.png,Is it oral candidiasis? I have strong allergy to candida.,"Hi, I just noticed today there's a badly looking white coloration on the roof of my mouth. Do you think it may be oral candidiasis? I don't smoke and I basically don't drink as I may have a glass of wine once in two weeks, but I do drink lots of sugary sodas and energy drinks such as Coca Cola or Monster and I sip it through a metal straw, which is sending fluid against my pellet at a decent pressure and I sometimes feel the irritation during sipping. I developed the habit of sipping sodas in 2020 during the pandemic and I frequently get down more than a liter of Coke alongside two coffees. Do you think it's Candida? I have a strong allergy to Candida verified through multiple tests since childhood as from all those 50 or so tiny allergen drops only the Candida produces a small blister with a large red spot around it, while everything else is non-reactive except cats and mold, which produce a small red circle. Is there any chance it will disappear naturally once I quit sodas and coffee?",1,1748873381.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False
1l1izv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1l1izv4/i_quit_caffeine_for_20_days_feeling_so_amazing/,"I Quit Caffeine for 20 Days, Feeling so amazing already","Sharing my experience for quitting caffeine for 20 days. I'll be trying forever now. The first week was rough-headaches, brain fog, exhaustion-but after that, my energy and focus became way more stable. Sleep improved, anxiety dropped, and productivity actually went up. Not planning to go back to daily caffeine anytime soon.

Like a lot of people, I relied heavily on caffeine to function. Coffee in the morning, another by lunch, and sometimes an energy drink later in the day. It felt normal, but I started questioning if it was really helping-or just propping me up while I ignored deeper issues like bad sleep and constant stress.

So I decided to quit caffeine for 20 days. No coffee, no tea, no energy drinks. Cold turkey. I also used an app called NOCAF to track my progress and stay motivated. The streak counter helped, something about seeing the days stack up made it easier to push through the tough moments.

**Week 1:** Honestly brutal. I had pounding headaches, zero energy, and couldn’t focus on anything. Mornings were the worst. I was groggy and irritable, and I felt like I couldn’t think straight. But I did notice that my sleep started improving almost immediately - deeper, longer rest. Still, waking up without caffeine felt like dragging myself out of cement.

**Week 2:** Things started to shift. The headaches faded, and while I was still tired, the fog began to lift. My mind felt calmer, more grounded. My energy wasn’t necessarily higher, but it was more even-no peaks and crashes. I stopped feeling wired and anxious all the time, even though I had more work and tighter deadlines than usual.

**Week 3 (Days 15-20):** A big turning point. My brain felt sharper-not in a hyper-focused, over-caffeinated way, but clearer. I wasn’t crashing in the afternoons anymore, and I felt like I could get into flow states more easily. Sleep continued to improve, and I woke up feeling rested for the first time in a while. I didn’t miss caffeine at all at this point.

**Takeaway:** Caffeine wasn’t giving me real energy-it was just covering up my exhaustion. Quitting forced me to face why I was so tired to begin with. Fixing my sleep, reducing stress, and working on better habits made more difference than coffee ever did. I might have an occasional cup here and there (once or twice a week), but I don’t see myself going back to multiple hits a day.

If you’re thinking about cutting back or quitting, I highly recommend trying it-even if just for a few weeks. And having some sort of calendar or app to track your streak helps more than you'd think.",2,1748873379.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

Location: Poughkeepsie, NY 

Friday evening a power line snapped and fell just outside of my home. My kids and I heard a loud explosion that shook our house and it smelled like something was burning. I stepped outside to investigate and felt a tingling, almost zappy kind of sensation. I stepped off my porch steps and saw the downed power line partially draped on my husband’s parked car and sizzling on the ground. I was not even 5-10 feet away from the downed line. I immediately called the power company. It took them an hour to arrive. I told them I was feeling off and tingly, they said I’m fine and if I feel any worse call 911. I didn’t sleep at all that night, I kept shocking myself on my comforter and my hands and feet had bad pins and needles. Come the next morning I’m feeling much worse. After drinking a cup of coffee my body started to feel like it was literally burning from the inside out and my body started spasming. I called 911. I begged them to hurry and send an ambulance, they sent a police unit who arrived 20 min later. It would take EMS another 10 to arrive. As soon as I’m in the ER I’m flooded by staff asking what drugs I take and if I’m a danger to myself or my kids, whom I was home alone with. The brought me into a secluded, monitored room and left me alone for nearly 2 hours before getting any kind of testing done, including vitals. The whole time I was crying and begging for them to come back and help. The hospital fought hard against a family friend who was called to pick up my kids and refused to give my husband (who works out of state) any updates on my treatment. When after 4 hours I finally saw the on call Dr. he admonished the staff for their treatment of me, saying “she’s not a criminal, she’s a patient!” Turns out the electric field around the downed power line triggered my nervous system into over load. On top of being treated like a junkie by the ER staff, he said it was the perfect storm to cause a complete nervous breakdown, a fully physical reaction to the stress caused by both the Er staff and the electrical field in my yard from the power line. The Dr said there was absolutely no reason to be placed in monitored seclusion. Even though my vitals were fine, my body was still going into shock and I shouldn’t have been treated like I was simply going through withdrawal. My drug panel came back 100% clean (unsurprisingly, I don’t do drugs or even drink). I was told it’s going to take my body a full week to calm down and fully reset my nervous system. Due to my experiences I cannot handle any more stress to my nervous system. 

That being said, I’m looking to sue. But I have no idea where to begin. Any and all advice would be very much appreciated. I’ll answer any follow up question asap. ",1,1748873312.0,legaladvice,1,1.0,False
1l1ix32,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_johnsmithmath89/comments/1l1ix32/can_drinking_coffee_help_reduce_the_risk_of_heart/,Can Drinking Coffee Help Reduce the Risk of Heart Disease?,"**Yes, drinking coffee in moderation can help reduce the risk of heart disease.** But it depends on how much you drink, how you drink it, and your overall lifestyle. Let’s break this down in a very simple way so everyone can understand.

 

# ✅ What Is Heart Disease?

Heart disease means your heart is not working the way it should. It includes things like:

* Blocked blood vessels
* Heart attacks
*  Irregular heartbeat

 

Heart disease is the **#1 cause of death** in the world. But the good news is—**healthy habits, like drinking coffee the right way, can help lower your risk**.

 

# ��So, How Can Coffee Help Your Heart?

Here are some **easy points** to explain how coffee can protect your heart:

# 1. Coffee Is Full of Healthy Stuff

Coffee has **antioxidants** (these are good guys that fight the bad stuff in your body). They protect your heart and help keep your blood vessels strong.

# 2. Coffee Can Lower Inflammation

Inflammation is when your body gets red and swollen inside, even if you don’t feel it. Over time, it can hurt your heart. Coffee helps lower that.

# 3. Coffee May Improve Blood Flow

Some research says coffee helps your blood flow better. That means your heart doesn’t have to work too hard to pump blood.

# 4. Coffee May Help Lower Bad Cholesterol (in some people)

Too much bad cholesterol can block your arteries. Some types of coffee, like **filtered coffee**, may help keep cholesterol in check.

 

# ��What Do the Studies Say? (Easy Stats)

Let’s look at **simple numbers** from real research:

 

*  A **2021 study** from the American Heart Association found that **drinking 2–3 cups of coffee per day** was linked to a **10% to 15% lower risk** of heart disease.
* A **large review** of over **21 studies** (with more than 1 million people) found that people who drank **3 to 5 cups of coffee daily** had the **lowest risk** of heart problems.

 

��**Expert says:**“Coffee is more than just a wake-up drink. It has natural chemicals that may protect the heart.”— Dr. Frank Hu, Professor of Nutrition at Harvard University

 

# ��‍�� What Do Real People Say? (User Experience)

# Sarah, 42, from Texas:

“I’ve been drinking black coffee every morning for 10 years. I also walk daily and eat healthy. At my last checkup, my doctor said my heart is in great shape!”

# Alex, 55, from New York:

“I switched from sugary drinks to black coffee. I feel more alert, and my blood pressure is better now.”

 

# ��Best Tips for Heart-Healthy Coffee

Here’s how to enjoy coffee **without hurting your heart**:

||
||
|**✅ Do This**|**❌ Avoid This**|
|Drink 2–4 cups a day|Drinking 6+ cups daily|
|Choose black or plain|Adding too much sugar/cream|
|Use paper filters|Drinking unfiltered coffee|
|Drink water too|Replacing meals with coffee|

 

# ��️ Infographic Ideas (For gomehedi.com)

You can add a colorful infographic to make the info easy to see. Some ideas:

# ��Infographic Title: “Coffee & Your Heart – What You Need to Know”

 

❤️ 3 Cups a Day = Lower Heart Risk

��Too Much Sugar = Bad for Heart

��Replace Sugary Drinks with Coffee

��Choose Filtered Over Boiled Coffee

 

# ��When to Be Careful

Coffee is safe for most people. But some should be careful:

*  People with very **high blood pressure**
*  People who feel **anxious or shaky** after coffee
*  Pregnant women (ask your doctor)

 

# ✅ Final Answer: Is Coffee Good for the Heart?

Yes, it can be! **Drinking 2 to 3 cups of plain coffee daily may help reduce the risk of heart disease**, if you're also eating healthy and staying active.

Looking some guidance. Our machine is a bit neglected. The history is that our company used to have a lot more employees and someone to manage this, but we have reduced significantly, and now there is no body to maintain it. The water filtering in place leaves much to be desired. We have VERY hard water where we are and the filter/softner we have installed is probably not doing enough. I've had to increase the size of the grind so dramaticly to get it to pull a shot, that it is boarding on drip coffee sized grounds. Its seems like it just cant get up to proper pressure, and nothing I've done can fix it. I do perform the back flushes with the coffee machine cleaner frequently, but this has no impact. Is there a guide to disassembly, and deep cleaning/descaling? Is the only option to call a professional? I am capable, and confident with the right guidance, but am reluctant to open an expensive machine without a clear recommendation or cause.

After my dog died, that placed me into a really bad head space where I just up and left a good job. I moved back home with my parents and was literally a hermit. The only time I left the house was to get the mail. I really missed my dog and my parents knew something wasn't right with my head.

Those 5 years consisted of jogging 6-8 miles every 2 days to stay in shape. During my off days, I literally just woke up at 6 or 7pm, drank coffee, loaded up dota 2 and would play for 8 to 10 hours, then would eat a big meal.

Woo Woo Woo.,"I want to tell you two things. The first one is embarrassing. The second one is spookily symbolic. Then I’ll go on for a bit, and after that I need you to help me make a decision.

**The Embarrassing Thing**

About this time last year I was in the grips of Dark Brandon fever. You remember that, right? Sort of? Ah those glorious days of Q1 2024. Whenever I think of them my internal monologue takes on a wistful french accent, no? We were so young. So innocent. We believed in Joe Biden. We believed he could win a second term. Perhaps easily? Because we had an itchy faith, but faith nonetheless, that our opted-out, not-following-the-news fellow Americans were basically if lazily on our side, and we were all done with Him. Job growth was strong. Inflation was slowly deflating. Quiet competence was good. Student loan forgiveness was admirable. The Gaza thing would be winding down any day now. Plus, He was sure to be on trial all summer, and likely to be convicted of many crimes before the election, and back then it was still widely believed that crimes were bad. Life was good. Hopium was in the water, like fluoride used to be. 

But (end French accent, begin Werner Herzog voice) also we were terribly afraid; terribly, paralyzingly afraid in a way that froze the possibility centers in our brains, and this was even before Project 2025 had dropped. He was still out there, the [unrepentant, unrepentable Hypnotoad of the 21st century](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64Qq31ucGy0), lurking in and at one with the darkness. 

And (normal voice) because we couldn’t do jack shit about this cognitive dissonance we wrapped ourselves in lolz. Someone created a meme where Joe Biden was shooting lasers out his eyes. I think it was a troll, but mostly we were trying to troll the abyss within, but whatever, it was hilarious: joie d’vivre d’pixels, an ironic somersault of fuck-yeah, a talisman of all dorkiness that could and would protect America. 

I upvoted every Dark Brandon post I could find. I smirked when my favorite podcasters mentioned it. I joined a Dark Brandon Discord and I don’t even know what Discord is. I bought Dark Brandon lawn signs (several of which would be stolen when I put them out, causing me to buy yet more.) And most importantly for this story, I got myself a Dark Brandon coffee mug.

**The Spookily Symbolic Thing**

The mug fell and broke. 

The exact circumstances I do not know, but I came home one afternoon in the early summer, and laser-eye’d-Joe was on the kitchen counter, its handle beside it in three pieces. My wife said that she’d opened the cupboard and he’d just fallen out. I had enjoyed being flamboyant with my Dark Brandon mug. When I would sip from it during Zoom meetings, I consciously used my left hand so that Joe’s face would look outwards, into the camera and directly at my colleagues who were all on the same page as me politically, but not as cool about it as I was. But while I wasn’t hurting for coffee receptacles, I was now hurting, just a little: At about that time I became  conscious of a persistent pinprick in my brain made slightly worse because I couldn’t quite find where, what or why it was. The mug had fallen. The sacred image of Biden had broken (but not shattered; still very repairable). There was a disturbance in the mojo. 

And this was all before June 27th. I will never forget that debate, despite the fact that I did not watch it. 

When I put the broken pieces of the mug up on the dining room shelf, there was still a lot of hope around . My wife and I agreed we’d fix it later. Maybe we’d even do that Japanese thing we saw on TikTok where people lovingly, almost spiritually, glued broken ceramics back together with faux-gold adhesive. That would make a good point, I thought, not being entirely sure what the point was. But then the rest of the year happened, assassination attempts, brat summers, cats and dogs, and the pieces of Dark Brandon remain exactly where we left them, oft-seen but untouched. 

**A Third Thing That Probably Impacts Everything, But Which Happened More-Or-Less As I Was Typing These Words And I Did Not Have The Time To Artfully Weave Into the Narrative Structure**

Joe Biden, 82, announced that he has Stage 4 prostate cancer. It has sunk to his bones.

In what may or may not be a coincidence, the announcement came just a day or two after the media pre-launch of Jake Tapper’s book [*Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, It’s Cover Up and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again*](https://www.amazon.com/Original-Sin-President-Cover-Up-Disastrous/dp/B0DTYKCJC9). Intentionally or otherwise, we find ourselves in the stands of a narrative rodeo, and it’s not clear which version of previous events is going to get stomped and which is going to win whatever one wins at a rodeo (a cow?). And because of the cancer, it seems pressing that we figure it all out pronto.

**But the Actual Question Is…**

..do I glue the Dark Brandon mug back together? Or do I throw it in the trash? 

The answer depends entirely on what we think of Joe Biden now, a year after his run for a second-term began to lose altitude and the consequences of it all have become dazzlingly, sickeningly clear? And is there anything worth taking from The Joe Biden Experience, anything that can help us move forward? 

**So….What** ***Do*** **We Think About Joe Biden?**

I’ll be honest, I’ve been trying to forget him. 

And until this last week it hasn’t really been that hard. The daily, omni-oxygen sucking Trumpocalypse hasn’t really left much bandwidth left for contemplation of the past. And that’s the thing. I tripped over that fact as I was trying to find my way forward here, but now that I look at it, it might just be the most important thing: 

Joe Biden is the past. 

He has occurred. But, even before the tumor jumped out from behind the curtain we all knew that Joe Biden would not recur.

We all knew this. I knew this and I was the biggest Joe-stan there was and even I felt that at best he was going to be a really solid transition to something newer and better, something I couldn’t quite see. To really realize how much of a placeholder Joe was, even at the moment of his greatest triumph in 2020, we just have to look at how totally weird it was that he was there in the first place. 

He was cold product when he became Vice President in 2008. That’s why Obama picked him: He was the sober, senior face of government experience, i.e. the very definition of a bland DC grandpa. The only cup of charm he had to set him apart from Chris Coons or Martin Heinrich or Ed Markey was his geezery wont of blurting out things that you could tell he meant to sound Malcom Gladwell-edgy but actually just sounded daffy. Remember when he wanted to split Iraq into three countries? By late 2014ish, the only reason most people could remember him was that he [was a recurring gag on *Parks & Rec*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvbMB_GGR6s), where comically sincere civic-striver Leslie Knope (played by Amy Poehler) was a Joe Biden fangirl. It was funny of course, and very Lesely Knope, for her to idolize Biden because no one idolized Joe Biden. Ever. He was a towering figure in Delaware, the smallest place anyone can be a towering figure. I don’t even think buildings can be taller than three-stories there.

The funny thing about now is that we are oppressed and exhausted by a Republican party, and  a dim plurality of voters, who are violently obsessed with the past. As a slogan, “Make America Great Again” works on a dizzying number of levels but its real power is that it's so simple: It says that the way to make America better is to make it like it was in the past. Exactly which past we’re supposed to be aiming for is left purposefully vague: My guess that they want 1951-1961. Trump has recently alluded to 1913 as peak America, though the last person you want to ask about what Donald Trump actually means is Donald Trump. Either way, I’m horrified and nauseated by it. All of it. Whenever, whatever. 

But you know what? I want to go back to the past too. And so do a lot of us normal people. But we want the politics time machine to take us back to the later-age of Obama. Set the dial for sometime between 2011 and the day of the golden escalator, June 16, 2015. I did not pay a lot of attention to politics back then, not nearly as much as I do now, not because I was checked-out of civic responsibility but because there just didn’t seem that much to pay attention to. I think we were worried about the budget deficit back then. The government might have shut down once or twice. Paul Ryan was a person who people talked about. I think he was an accountant of some kind. A lot of people were either righteous or upset about gay marriage, but we all knew which way that was going and we were just floating along with the social current. It was taking longer to arrive at the future than I would have hoped, but that’s how life is: You just wait.

I miss a lot about the before-times, but I miss that most of all: The confidence that you get from  familiar things, familiar problems, familiar solutions, familiar patterns. Hope and hopelessness both existed, but they came in known shapes and moved in known ways. 

I missed this especially in the coughing, quivering, pacing-back-and-forth winter of 2020, when not even toilet paper made sense anymore and registered Democrats were trying to figure out who they wanted to run against Donald Trump. What I wanted more than anything was someone who was normal, someone who could make America familiar again. And in this moment, in my sight, Joe Biden stepped into the phone booth and Superman stepped out, wearing aviator sunglasses and holding an ice cream cone.

Everything that made him laughably irrelevant and dusty before made him powerful now. He seemed to get along with everyone. Good. He was a realistic, incremental-change kind of guy who knew how to legislate. Great. The feeling I had, and the feeling that I think Joe had, and the whole promise of his campaign really was that we had merely blown past our exit in History and if America could just get off at the 2020 exit and double back we’d be more or less okay. More than anyone, I thought, Joe Biden could deliver on “okay.” 

There were other options of course.

Bernie Sanders for one. I liked Bernie Sanders for many reasons. But Bernie would have been something new: a mold breakingly leftist president, and also an ancient Jewish president, who had a heart-attack in the middle of the campaign; a candidate who makes Larry David look young and open-minded. And new is scary. 

In Bernie’s case, new was scary because of the changes he promised to bring. I could deal with that uncertainty. But what was scarier was the thought that that legions of convincible, Trump-exhausted voters out there would find his new ideas slightly scarier than I did, and thus he’d probably lose. Samesies with Pete Butteigeig. Great guy. Super intelligent, young and forward looking. Loved Pete. But a gay President would be something very new. And for something that new to happen I figured that the whole coalition needed to turn their keys at the same time. But elderly black church ladies in Atlanta and Detroit might not do that, and if they didn’t vote, then we all end up back in the pit. 

As it turned out the elderly black church ladies in South Carolina made their preferences known. So it was Joe. That he pulled it out seemed like divine intervention. That the contentious primary ended after South Carolina, with Pete and Amy Klobuchar and Beto (ah, Beto) endorsing within hours gave to me an also-embarrassing-to-admit but very real faith in the Democratic string-pullers who must have pulled those particular strings, at that particular post-South Carolina momen, to get the fractured field to coalesce around Joe. Ironically I would feel the same familiar blooming trust in dull-but-shady septuagenarians just a little over four years later when after all the seemingly pointless cringing and posting into the void, someone finally said something to Joe Biden that made him step aside. I honestly don’t even know who or what I was believing in at either point, but it felt so good to believe.

Everything I knew about Biden prior to the 2020 election I have already written above. But everything I learned about him during that campaign made me like him more. [Mostly this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oITUm8MushI). I watched it over and over and over again. (I can’t bear to do so anymore.) In the past Joe’s simple empathy and humanity would have been unremarkable, little more than table stakes. But in 2020 what used to be hokey was catnip for normies.

Best of all, Joe won. By less than he should have. And the post-election process turned out to be shockingly iffy. Maybe I should have been more worried about that. Maybe we all should have been. But at that point we’d been worried for four years and if I couldn’t let go when He was finally gone-ish, then what was the point of anything? It had been bumpy getting there, but the past was back.

And it was great. For me and pretty much everyone I knew. Inflation was up, but I was far from struggling. Important issues were addressed in slow, infuriating ways: But the news was about Joe Manchin being a pain in the ass, not white supremacists taking actual dumps on legislation. Laws were passed, laws that set the country on a course to deal with climate change. We had a bipartisan commission investigating January 6th, minor shitbags were pleading guilty. Afghanistan was over and we were helping Russia kick its own ass in Ukraine, even if our guns arrived hemmingly and hawingly. This was good. Weren’t most of us on the same page about that? The predicted Red Tsunami of 2022 underwhelmed everyone. Fox was crying about the border, that particular boy had been crying about tamale-eating wolves so long I barely even heard them anymore. 

We had done it. 

Except that we hadn’t.

It turns out that you can’t actually ever bring the past back, because no matter how much past you stuff in the present, the future is still right there waiting for you, pressing its face against the glass and licking its teeth.

**Ah Fuck**

In the year of our Lord 2024, neither I, nor anyone in power, nor anyone else in the United States was actually living in the past. What people who believed (with varying degrees of enthusiasm) that Joe Biden should get a second-term were actually doing was *performing* *the past.* 

We were thinking in ways we had traditionally thunk, saying things we had traditionally said, looking at maps and numbers we had traditionally looked at and believing things we had traditionally believed all so that we could, as we traditionally had, feel safe and ordered.

Which would have worked out great except that the number of people who needed to feel safe and ordered in America that year added up to just short of 270 electoral votes.

Wealthy, golf-obsessed nihilists had been poking holes in our body politic for a very long time and we had never stopped the bleeding. At the same time all these gloriously past-y things were happening, inequality was growing, bigoted paranoias was spreading, trust was evaporating and when you tried to forget about all that by just going for breakfast at McDonald’s suddenly it was $30, which wasn’t going to break me but geez-us. 

And yet at every point from 2022 onwards, supporting, defending and pushing for Joe Biden was the only logical thing for a normal person to do. Many have said that if Joe had declined to run around the end of 2022, and a healthy primary election had produced a new Democratic nominee for 2024, the party would have done better than it did. This is obviously correct.

(For a lot of reasons I think, but one of the most persuasive is that if it had happened, everyone would have spent all of 2023 thinking “Ooooh, I wonder who Democrats will nominate?”, versus what we actually spent that time thinking, which was, more-or-less, “donaldtrumpdonaldtrumpdonaldtrumpdonaldtrumpdonaldtrump”.)  

But that course of action was just-as-obviously impossible. Because for that to happen, hundreds of very powerful people and tens of millions of normal people on whom their power depended would have had to quickly and simultaneously walk away from the desire for calm, sane, normie progress they knew and craved, that they had worked for years to achieve, and had finally gotten. Facing the incipient chaos of Trump II, they / we would have had to just - for a reason that was not so apparent then - decide that we’d like some more chaos please. Yeah, go right ahead and give us an 18-way primary .

That everyone *did* simultaneously jump ship, and onto the S.S. Harris, a year later when our sense of crisis got too hot to ignore is a good and healthy sign for us normal people. Republicans cannot do this anymore than they can fly. But it also makes clear that we would never have done this without a sense of crisis, which didn’t exist earlier. 

I’m guessing that Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s buzzy new book delivers salacious (“salacious” in the Ben Gay / Matlock sense of the word) new evidence of the former president’s potentially timeline altering decline*.* I have to guess that because I didn’t, and won’t, read the book. I contemplated asking ChatGPT for the key points and anecdotes so I could relate them to you, but even that would be a waste of time. We already know the thing: In 2022 and 23, there were signs that Joe Biden was struggling to keep up. He looked and acted old. There were real questions about his ability to function at a presidential level. Joe and his aides ignored those questions entirely. 

Joe should have had the grace to face the questions and step aside. Probably the book makes this sound like some unique, unmissable King Lear-level tragedy, and the outcome certainly was, but it’s also the most boring thing ever: An old man was acting like a stubborn old man. Crazy, right?

(Funny how that works: That particular realities seem endlessly profound and dramatic, while the general truths that cause them are hardly worth talking about. Like if someone told you that your two neighbors were having an affair, and were about to ruin their lives with it, you would gossip about that relentlessly. For years even. But if someone told you that human beings - including your neighbors - are likely to do horny and shortsighted things, which of course you’ve already known since forever, you’d be like “yuh huh” without even looking up from your phone.)

Joe’s lieutenants should have had the courage to tell the world what they saw, and try to force the sort of crisis that took place in summer 2024 to happen a year earlier. But all those very smart people with lots of information and power were doing exactly the same thing that I was: They weren’t thinking about making 2024 as positive as it could possibly be. They were white-knuckling it, trying to keep 2023 as much like 2013 as they could for as long as they possibly could. 

Lenin said there are decades when nothing happens; and there are weeks when decades happen. Truth. Also true: In the ambiguous place where time and hope flow together, you never really know what’s what or when’s when. It’s hard to say how long the past can last if you want it to. If you like what happened yesterday, and that same thing is happening today, why can’t it keep going? Flick away your problems like mosquitoes and linger at the lake: Summer can go on. 

**Until It Can’t**

One way I think about it now is that on November 6, 2024 the nostalgia of fools, bigots and the confused was still running white hot, but the nostalgia of basically normal people (both those who vote regularly, and those who shrugged-out of the election) had melted away. The Age of Comparative Decency and Predictability we had up until 2016 was no longer credible. That past has passed.

And I find myself…strangely relieved. “Unburdened by what has been,” was how someone once put it.

Joe Biden was just what we all needed in 2020. In a lot of ways that are important he was a surprisingly good chief executive. He was the most moral president of my lifetime. Even if he was reduced to a motionless head in a cryogenic jar, we’d all be much better off with him as president than we are right now. 

When it came to the most consequential decision of his administration, Joe fucked up. The people he trusted fucked up. Neither he nor they understood the decision that was in front of them, which might be part of the same omnibus fuck-up or an entirely independent fuck-up, depending on how you look at it. They held onto the past too long. I could continue to wrestle with what this all means for another 10,000 words easy. But here’s the beautiful, glorious, shining amazing thing: 

I don’t have to. And neither do you.

We’ve finally let go of the past.

Technically it might be more accurate to say that the past was violently ripped from our lap and forcefully ejected through the windshield, out of the vehicle and into a concrete abutment before falling into a ditch during the high-speed democratic crash that was 2024, but whatever. It’s gone. And no one’s even looking for it.

If you don’t spend much time dwelling on the naval architects who screwed up on the Titanic, or the decisions made by the management of the New York Jets, then you don’t need to think anything much about Joe Biden, other than to pray for his health. What happened happened. And now that the past-and-familiar is out of our systems, hopefully we can see clearly that what normal people need to do next - for our economy, our government and our culture - needs to be new, even if that is a bit scary.

**Which Still Does Not Answer The Question of the Mug**

Do I glue it back together, as a symbolic act that presages the rebuilding of our country and politics? Or do I chuck its pieces as a symbolic act of embracing the future in all its uncertainty?

I’m 19. Into classic movies (yes, I love The Good, The Bad and The Ugly), emotional story games that destroy you in the best way, writing poetry and short stories when I get in my head a little too much.

What I’m looking for:
A long-term friend. Someone I can talk to regularly. Could be about deep life stuff or stupid memes. Could be voice notes at 2am or random “you gotta hear this song” moments. I’m open-minded, respectful, and not here to waste anyone’s time.
And no, I won’t ghost you. I know how to hold a convo and actually enjoy it.

Throwaway because I don't want this on my main. Quick preamble, as I know what Reddit is like. This disagreement occurred yesterday. We've worked out how to handle such situations in the future in a way that would make us both happy, but we still don't agree about the core issue. This is very low-stakes, but we want to see what the internet has to say about this. I've told my partner I'm making this post.

And now onto the story.

My partner K and I were enjoying our morning coffee and getting ready to leave the house for an event. We share one bathroom. K had to shower, and it was about halfway through this 10 minute shower that I started experiencing intestinal cramping. I didn't say anything, because obviously I'm not going to poop while someone is in the shower, but after K got out of the shower I did say that I very urgently need to use the toilet.

K asked me to wait a few minutes and started to use the electric shaver. I said okay, but please hurry, as I really really need to go. K asked me not to rush them and took about 7 additional minutes to shave. After K put down the electric shaver and left the bathroom, I quickly went in and started to close the door. K came back with a regular razor (it had been packed in a weekend bag for a recent trip) saying ""I'm not done! This is incredibly rude, who raised you?"" and went to finish shaving.

I argued that urgent bodily functions should always take precedent over personal grooming, and I am in active pain trying to hold it. K countered that it's basic bathroom etiquette to wait until a person is fully done, and that it's not rocket science to understand why they might not want to get ready in a poopy bathroom. Apparently I always rush K when I need to poop. The thing is, I don't think I'm wrong for that, because what else can you do when nature calls?

I grew up sharing a bathroom with two siblings, one with Crohn's disease, which may color my view somewhat. I do struggle with GI issues, but so does K - and K grew up sharing a single bathroom with one sister and both parents, as the only one in the family to have GI issues. K joked about how my family won't tolerate elbows on the table, but disregards basic bathroom etiquette.

So, who's right? Am I the AH for rushing K out of the bathroom when I need to poop and K is just shaving? Does ""basic bathroom etiquette"" not include making way for someone's urgent bodily needs when your own needs can wait?",1,1748872801.0,AmItheAsshole,6,1.0,False

1l1iqpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigBudgetBrides/comments/1l1iqpe/palm_springs_wedding_venue_research/,Palm Springs Wedding Venue Research,"An overview of my experience researching Palm Springs area wedding venues! Our wedding is October 2026, but I've seen a lot of brides-to-be asking questions about a number of these so thought I'd consolidate and share the wealth. 

**General Notes:**

* Our top priorities were being able to have all our guests \~125-150 stay on property, food/beverage program and aesthetic. Many of our guests are traveling very far to be there, so we wanted to make it as easy for them to take an extended vacation as possible. We don't want to have to reinvent the wheel with decor. 
* Rentals for chairs, tables, flatware, satellite bars, lighting, etc get pricey and we were hoping to find a venue which included all or most of these elements.
* Palm Springs has a noise ordinance that requires a level of quiet after 10pm and this is taken *extremely* seriously by the venues and law enforcement. My advice is to think about your after party vibe as a major factor factor going into venue selection. Because we knew we wanted a specific after party vibe, an indoor space to continue the night was key. Many of these venues will require you to go off property for your after party, which we didn't want to do.

**Ace Hotel & Swim Club:** [https://acehotel.com/palm-springs/](https://acehotel.com/palm-springs/)

* 179 guest rooms
* Gorgeous venue and very good deal for the price! They have 179 guest rooms so it was way too big for us to be able to do a buyout, but they had some of the most affordable venue fees we saw in the process. They had multiple event space options to choose from. 
* If we were looking for the disco/desert retro type of vibe, this would be top of my list! They are clearly a well-oiled machine and have done a lot of beautiful weddings.

**Alcazar:** [https://alcazarpalmsprings.com/](https://alcazarpalmsprings.com/)

* 34 guest rooms and 100-125 person event max capacity. Two-night buyout minimum on the weekends
* Room rates were not bad \~$265 per night, but the event fees were a lot for what you got in my opinion. Tables, chairs, lighting, etc is not included so that would be an OOP cost. I felt this property was very expensive considering the limitations

**ARRIVE Hotel:** [https://www.arrivehotels.com/hotels/palm-springs](https://www.arrivehotels.com/hotels/palm-springs)

* 32 guest rooms, events can hold up to 150 seated.
* Pros are it's VERY affordable and I felt you got a lot for your money. It's in Palm Springs without being too in the center of things. 
* Did a site visit and stayed overnight here, it was very fun vibes! Not as fancy as some of the other venues but we really enjoyed our food and drinks here. If you are having a mostly adults/couples wedding then this could work but the rooms are all King (not that uncommon in PS) and the bathrooms are OPEN. So if you are in the shower, you are in full view of the rest of the room. We asked and they are all like that. 
* Their event space was cute and customizeable, the events manager was so sweet and accomodating. The vibe reminded me of a Moxy hotel where you check-in at the bar and get a cocktail. We agreed that this would be a super fun vibe for a birthday celebration or bach party, but was not the aesthetic we wanted.

**Avalon Palm Springs:** [https://www.avalon-hotel.com/palm-springs/](https://www.avalon-hotel.com/palm-springs/)

* 72 rooms on property, 18+
* This is connected to Ingleside Estate but they are not the same property. The events manager is the same across both and it's a very structured events package with a lot of detail. Very classic retro PS vibe and it would be one of our top if that was the aesthetic we were going for. Black and white accents, gorgeous view of the mountains and palm trees in each of the event area options. Felt very private while still being right in the center of PS. 

**DRIFT Palm Springs:** [https://www.drifthotels.co/palmsprings](https://www.drifthotels.co/palmsprings)

* 88 guest rooms and \~200 for events space. The majority of the rooms are suites with kitchens and living rooms. Many are two-, three- or four-bedroom suites so if you are looking to have guests take an extended vacation, it's perfect! Family-friendly property
* Gorgeous minimalist Tulum desert vibe, very different than any other venue we saw. They are relatively new but have the events down to a science, with so much available customization. Food was incredible, Mexican focused and cocktails were 10/10
* Buyout is very flexible with an option to fully commit or do 10% attrition. A lot of the other properties didn't have an option for this. Even thought the restaurant doesn't close during a buyout, it still felt extremely private. 

**Ingleside Estate:** [https://inglesideestate.com/](https://inglesideestate.com/)

* 30 rooms on property, 18+ but kids allowed with buyout
* We did a site visit and this was my #2 choice overall. I felt it was a classic aesthetic with an overgrown, fairytale greenery feeling. The celebrations can happen in a handful of places, but the restaurant (Melvyn's) is always open to the public. My fiancee felt the rooms did not justify what they cost. If we were to have booked this venue, it allows people in budget to stay on property but it's SO integrated into downtown PS that people could stay other places as well. 
* Food trucks NOT allowed on property, comes with all tables/chairs/linens/flatware

**Korakia Pensione:** [https://www.korakia.com/](https://www.korakia.com/)

* 29 rooms on property (58 guests) and up to 180 guests for events
* Rentals, catering, or entertainment are not included but they have a list of vendors they recommend. There is no indoor space on the property (rain isn't really an issue in PS) but that means that festivities strictly end at 10pm and any after parties must be off property. 
* Includes options for yoga, sound baths, etc that can be added onto your wedding festivities! 

**Parker Palm Springs:** [https://www.parkerpalmsprings.com/](https://www.parkerpalmsprings.com/)

* 144 rooms on property
* Just incredible! I was obsessed but I knew it was out of our budget when I reached out and hurt my own feelings. If we literally did no flowers, no decor, *maybe* a DJ, we would still be at or a little over budget. I would want to stay at this property for a vacation but it just wasn't a fit for our budget and group. 

**Royal Sun (Formerly Life House):** [https://royalsunps.com/](https://royalsunps.com/)

* We did a site visit and this was by far the cheapest overall in terms of event fees, food packages, etc. The full buyout was possible (66 rooms on property) and rooms were under $200 in busier seasons
* It's not as glamourous or modern, but if you are interested in a ceremony at the Moorten Botanical Garden, this is very convenient. The property could do with some renovation, but according to the events manager, that is coming in late 2025. 

**The Saguaro:** [https://thesaguaro.com/](https://thesaguaro.com/)

* 244 total guest rooms
* Rainbow hotel! It was so fun and the events manager was SO nice and excited for us! It's 244 total guest rooms so way too big for us, but would be AMAZING if you have a big party crew, this would be a great spot.
* The aesthetic is bold and they do a lot of fun LGBTQIA+ events that we will definitely be attending on future vacations. Very affordable room rates around $200 in the fall and most rentals included. Catering menu has options as flexible as $120 or so per person, I'm obsessed with the events manager Mark and the vibe overall.  

**Sands Hotel & Spa:** [https://sandshotelandspa.com/](https://sandshotelandspa.com/)

* This was one of our favorites and absolutely STUNNING. We did a site visit and ate on property twice. It's a gorgeous hotel and the number one benefit of the property is that if their decor is your vibe, then you will have to do almost nothing for decor on top of what's included (pink linens, disco balls, etc.) Food was very good, the cocktails were not our style. 
* The property is in Indian Wells, not Palm Springs so it's not a really walkable area. If you are a big golfer and that will be part of the wedding festivities then it's a perfect area. For us, because we are hoping guests will stay 3+ days, we wanted activities to be more accessible without renting a car.
* A full buyout was possible but we felt that even with the full buyout, since they could not close the restaurant (without a LOT of additional $$) and the restaurant's entrance was within the main courtyard, rather than having a separate entrance, it was not as private as we would like. 
* Rooms were fantastic! No kitchens/living space for most of them. 
* The events manager here is AMAZING and was so accomodating. Every other tour we went on mentioned knowing or working with Olivia and she's a local wedding planning celebrity. 
* Food trucks allowed on property, comes with all tables/chairs/linens/flatware

**Villa Royale:** [https://villaroyale.com/](https://villaroyale.com/)

* 37 villa-style guest rooms, 21+ property
* We stayed in four hotels during our research visit and this was by far our favorite hotel room and guest experience. Rooms were unique but relaxing and private, breakfast and coffee on property was such a vibe and the pools are open late. 
* The ceremony space is HUGE like, football field huge, and surrounded by tall hedges. If you are having a 250+ person wedding, this would be amazing but our group wouldn't have filled the space without a couple of bouncy houses.
* If you have a very specific vibe for what you want in terms of chairs, bars, flatware, etc. this could work because they don't include any of that. But the property has an elegant fairytale vibe.
* This isn't as deep in the heart of PS as many of the other venues and more in a residential area.
* We will be staying here on a future PS vacation but not hosting our wedding. Food and drink were fantastic.

Hi all, just wanting some advice on whether I’m worrying for no reason or if I should be pushing to be seen sooner. My appointment with the endo isn’t until October. I completely understand that endocrinologists are usually very booked up but I’m worried to wait that long due to my results and symptoms.

My bloodwork from this past week: TPO Ab came back as 212 IU/mL, my TSH was 1.070 uIU/mL, and my T4 was 17.5 ug/dL. I had an ultrasound done last August which was reported as follows:

IMPRESSION: 
1. Left mid to lower thyroid gland solid isoechoic nodule measuring 0.8 cm.

2. TI-RADS 3


I’ve been feeling on and off really shitty for quite awhile now. But I was blaming my symptoms on my long term depression, endometriosis, and medications. Symptoms I’ve been struggling with are:


-Heat intolerance. I damn near passed out at a picnic a couple weeks ago even though it was only 80 degrees. Years ago I lived in the desert and never had a problem being in 110 degree heat. 


-Tremors in my hands. I was blaming this on my Wellbutrin (even though I’ve been on it for years)


-Diarrhea. Like. So often it’s ridiculous. God forbid I have coffee I will shit ten times in one day. I blamed this on my endometriosis initially. 


-High heart rate and chest pain. I’ve been getting high heart rate notifications nearly every day since November (when I got my watch) and feel like my heart skips a beat often/sometimes feels like it’s going to jump right out of my chest.


-Irritability, anxiety, feeling like I want to peel my skin off. I constantly have that feeling in my chest that you get when you’re at the top of a rollercoaster right before it drops. 


-Weight loss. This has happened a couple times prior in the last couple years. I go through phases of having a normal weight/normal appetite, to not being able to keep weight on/having a bad appetite due to nausea and gagging. I have again dropped down from 141lbs to 124lbs in the span of 2.5 months without trying. 


-I never really get sleepy I could stay up all night if I wanted to. I take cannabis RSO oil for my back and endo pain most nights though so that does knock me out. 


-I used to frequent the gym but I have been feeling SO exhausted and weak since the winter.



I’ve been so torn up about all of this even though I know it’s probably nothing serious. I’ve just been feeling so shitty for so long and I was blaming it on depression/being lazy. I just want to feel better😕",1,1748872721.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

I miss his laugh. I miss his touch. I miss his gaze. I just miss him, but I’m terrified I’m starting to forget parts of him as the days drag on and he isn’t here to remind me.

I'll be trying forever now. The first week was rough-headaches, brain fog, exhaustion-but after that, my energy and focus became way more stable. Sleep improved, anxiety dropped, and productivity actually went up. Not planning to go back to daily caffeine anytime soon.

Like a lot of people, I relied heavily on caffeine to function. Coffee in the morning, another by lunch, and sometimes an energy drink later in the day. It felt normal, but I started questioning if it was really helping-or just propping me up while I ignored deeper issues like bad sleep and constant stress.

So I decided to quit caffeine for 20 days. No coffee, no tea, no energy drinks. Cold turkey. I also used an app called NOCAF to track my progress and stay motivated. The streak counter helped, something about seeing the days stack up made it easier to push through the tough moments.

**Week 1:** Honestly brutal. I had pounding headaches, zero energy, and couldn’t focus on anything. Mornings were the worst. I was groggy and irritable, and I felt like I couldn’t think straight. But I did notice that my sleep started improving almost immediately - deeper, longer rest. Still, waking up without caffeine felt like dragging myself out of cement.

**Week 2:** Things started to shift. The headaches faded, and while I was still tired, the fog began to lift. My mind felt calmer, more grounded. My energy wasn’t necessarily higher, but it was more even-no peaks and crashes. I stopped feeling wired and anxious all the time, even though I had more work and tighter deadlines than usual.

**Week 3 (Days 15-20):** A big turning point. My brain felt sharper-not in a hyper-focused, over-caffeinated way, but clearer. I wasn’t crashing in the afternoons anymore, and I felt like I could get into flow states more easily. Sleep continued to improve, and I woke up feeling rested for the first time in a while. I didn’t miss caffeine at all at this point.

**Takeaway:** Caffeine wasn’t giving me real energy-it was just covering up my exhaustion. Quitting forced me to face why I was so tired to begin with. Fixing my sleep, reducing stress, and working on better habits made more difference than coffee ever did. I might have an occasional cup here and there (once or twice a week), but I don’t see myself going back to multiple hits a day.

If you’re thinking about cutting back or quitting, I highly recommend trying it-even if just for a few weeks. And having some sort of calendar or app to track your streak helps more than you'd think.",17,1748872685.0,productivity,10,0.84,False

I like going to this one store & I plan to keep going to it. But this man who appeared to maybe be about 40 years old (I’m 26F), comes closer to me while I’m checking out & asks “Hi there, whats your ethnicity?”

I say “no thank you,” & he asks again saying that he was just asking. His tone was very polite, but i know the intention of them asking that kind of question. I say harshly, “You dont need to know.” I’m not gonna turn him on. Thats not my responsibility. I’m getting nothing out of this interaction. In fact i fell like my energy & authority is being taken.

1l1in0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marik0Galsun/comments/1l1in0u/the_four_seasons/,The Four Seasons,"I don't know how it happened. I don't know why I wanted it. 

Sorry. That was a lie.  I do know. It is just difficult to admit it. Really difficult.

I knew I was in trouble the first time I had to shower after PE. I didn't know about the stereotype then, but I could see that mine was smaller. A lot smaller. I felt like I was being looked at. That the white guys and black guys were silently mocking me.  The only thing that kept them from saying it out loud was that saying anything about someone else's penis would have made them *gay*.  But it was obvious. There was no hiding it. They had cocks.  I had a pinky sized  appendage. I would learn there were words for it. Boi Clit. Rice Dick. **S**^mall **A**^sian **D**^ick. Pricklet. Oriental Organette.

When I started dating Anjie, I couldn't help myself. I had to ask. I had to know. From day one I felt like she was out of my league.  I didn't want to.....I don't know. Rock the boat?  Throw a wrench into things?  Fuck it up? But I couldn't help myself. I had to ask. Have you ever been with a white guy? A black guy? How many? Who were they? How often would you suck him off? Did you swallow? What were their names? How big were their cocks? Did you cum? Did he go down on you? Do he fuck you bare? Did he cum in you? 

I would ask her during sex. My three and a half inches of thumb wide Asian manhood doubled up in a MyOne 45c condom with numbing gel on the inside in a mildly successful effort not to cum to fast. I would pick apart her sexual partners and encounters, one by one. Anjie on top, jilling her clit so she could cum. My trying to hold back she cock warmed me.

I have a spreadsheet. Chronological. Names. Locations. Cock sizes. Spit, swallow, positions, condoms, cream pies.  I sleuthed her Facebook for their pictures and embedded them.

I guess it conditioned us. I mean, maybe I made it happen and made her want it? I don't know. 

Maybe it was a rut? With out much variation, it was always the same. I would go down on her and give her an orgasm. Then she would get on top. My first real girlfriend said that fucking me was like finger banging and say other humiliating things.  I couldn't help myself on that score either, and told Anjie.

So she would get on top and slip me in and we wouldn't move. ""Tell me about the time you fucked....Tell me about sucking off......."" My favorites were the big cocks, and the guys who cream pied her. And her first times.  She'd jill to an orgasm, and that would get me off.

So I guess this was inevitable.

We made a couples profile on OK Cupid.  A few photos of us as a couple with our faces blurred. A few of just Anjie in bikinis. From our honeymoon, and our last trip to Jamaica.

I felt a little guilty, pretending to be Anjie when I interacted with potentials. But they did not want chat with me. They wanted to chat with her. So I was her, vetting. 

I added a new tab to the spreadsheet for potentials. Names, which probably were not real until I did an ID check. Embedded photos of their face and dick pic. 

The profile said ""man"" instead of ""white man"" because I did not want to seem racist. So that added some black, Asian and latino men into the sift. After chatting with a few assholes, and a few uglies, I narrowed it down about about a dozen potentials.  John was just sort of a random pick for the first time. 

He didn't hesitate to send proof pic, and a dick pic with a ruler. So I guess he was not random so much as at 8 inches, he was the biggest. Also tall, blond, athletic. A senior in college.  Varsity lacrosse. He confessed to having Yellow Fever, and had been with a few Asian girls before.  When I mentioned the school girl theme, he said that would ""hot.""

“Ping Ping?” he asked as he approached me.

 I met him for coffee to, well, interview I guess. I was pretty nervous. John sat down across from me and he seemed fucking huge, and I regretted not picking a shorter guy.  He looked exactly like his pictures. Athletic, confident, and conventionally handsome.

“Yeah,” I said, clearing my throat. “So I guess you're John. I just wanted to meet you in person to make sure everything’s clear before next Saturday.”

He leaned back in his chair. “Yeah. Got it. Safeword’s ‘Stop Watch,’ condoms are non-negotiable. I am cool with you making a video. Anything else?”

I nodded, trying to keep my voice steady. “Just… be respectful. This is a big deal for Anjie. And for me. I need to see some ID. I mean, you look over 18, but just to be sure. You know?”

 He reached for his wallet as he spoke. “I get it. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of her.”

Sure enough, he was 21. And the way he said it, with that quiet confidence was a little unnerving. I couldn’t quite say why. I wasn’t sure. All I knew was that I’d chosen him because he seemed like the kind of guy who could handle this without making it weird, but so far, he was proving me right.

---

That afternoon Anjie and I went for laser hair removel. Then to the hairdresser for bangs and a Japanese perm for the schoolgirl look. I was surprised when she suggested it, but it made me feel like she was actually into it. I had been thinking a short cheongsam, but I was happy to go all in. I even ordered a Seifuku from Japan. Genuine, navy blue sailor style, and not cheap.

Saturday came faster than I expected. I booked Anjie for the spa at The Four Seaons. I checked us in to your suite, specifically requesting 304 when I made the reservation. Then went to the CVS. That was interesting. The self-checkout was out of order, and I found myself standing in line with a box of Magnum condoms and MyOne 45cs, feeling like every eye in the store was on me. The cashier, a black guy with a bored expression, gave me a knowing look as he rang them up. I mumbled a thanks and bolted out of there as fast as I could.

By the time I got back to The Four Seasons, Anjie was already in the room, in the oversized hotel robe, putting on her makeup. She looked stunning.  And relaxed. I suppose from the massage and body scrub.  

I couldn't think of anything to say, so I ordered room service: A seafood tower, and a bottle of Veuve Rosé.

I went to the closet where I had hung the seifuku, and laid out on the bed. I had seriously considered a pearl v-string, but decided on white cotton panties and a white bralette to complete the school girl look.  The only deviations were white, over the knee socks for the zettai ryōiki, Tom Ford padlock sandals with impossibly thin six inch stiletto heels, and a padlock anklet with a Queen of Hearts charm. 

When Anjie was done with her makeup, she stood up, dropping the robe over the chair, and looking at herself in the mirror. She looked amazing. I was already hard, but just seeing her like that. Well, now I was aching hard. Like, cock throbbing, ball aching hard.

“You look amazing,” I told her. She was glowing.

She smiled at me, her lips painted a soft pink. “Thanks. I want everything to be perfect.”

I hesitated for a moment before asking, “Do you… want to have sex? Just us, before he gets here?”

Anjie turned to face me, her expression softening. “No, Ping. I want my pussy to be perfect for the man you selected.” She said it so matter-of-factly, like it was the most natural thing in the world. It made me even harder. I wanted her so much, but I didn’t push it.

Watching her get dressed made it even worse.  Panties and bralette. Skirt and sailor shirt. Rolling up the over the knee socks.  Strapping on the Tom Ford sandals, and locking on the anklet. 

I felt like I could barely breath when she stood up, and walked toward me. There is something about her being taller than me when she puts on heels that twists me inside. She handed me the key to the padlock with a look that said: *Don't lose it.*

There was a knock at the door, and I nearly jumped out of my skin. Room service. The Hispanic bell hop who entered gave Anjie a once-over, his eyes lingering just a beat too long on her outfit. I could feel my face heating up, but I didn’t say anything.  He set up the seafood tower, opened the champagne. I tipped him and he left with a polite nod, and I busied myself with rearranging the items on the table, trying to calm my nerves.

My phone buzzed, and I nearly dropped it in my haste to check the message. It was John.

I’m here.

I took a deep breath and texted back. *Room 304.*

---

John arrived a few minutes later, but it seemed to last forever. He looking even more impressive in person than he had at the coffee shop. He was dressed casually. Faded jeans and a fitted white shirt that showed off his athletic body. His eyes immediately zeroed in on Anjie, and I saw the way his gaze flicked over her, taking in every detail. Anjie stood up, her posture confident but her eyes slightly shy.

“Hi,” she said softly.

“Hey,” John replied, his voice warm. “You look incredible.”

Anjie blushed, and I felt tension in my gut as my heart pound. My stomach was twist in knots. I stepped forward, extending my hand.

“Thanks for coming, John.”

He shook my hand, his grip firm but not overbearing. “Thanks for having me. I’m looking forward to this.”

I nodded, trying to ignore the way my heart was pounding in my chest. “Anjie’s ready whenever you are.”

John turned to her, his expression softening. “How about we start with a drink? Help us both relax a little.”

Anjie smiled, her tension easing. “That sounds nice.”

I poured three glasses of champagne, my hands shaking just enough to make it difficult. We clinked glasses, and I took a deep sip, letting the bubbles calm my nerves. John and Anjie made small talk, their voices low and intimate, like they were already in their own little world. I sat back, watching them, feeling like an outsider in my own plan.

---

Eventually, the conversation lulled, and the tension in the room grew palpable. John set his glass down and turned to Anjie, his eyes serious. “Are you ready?”

Anjie glanced at me, then back at John and nodded.

John stood up, taking her hand in his. “Let’s get more comfortable.”

He led her to the bed, and I followed at a distance, my heart racing. John sat down on the edge of the mattress, pulling Anjie gently onto his lap. She let out a soft gasp as he leaned in, his lips brushing against hers in the lightest of kisses. It was tentative at first, but quickly deepened, their mouths moving together in a slow, sensual rhythm.

I couldn’t look away. My breath caught in my throat as John’s hands slid up Anjie’s thighs, pushing the skirt of her seifuku up just enough to reveal white cotton panties. Anjie moaned softly into the kiss, her hands tangling in John’s hair as he pulled her closer.

John broke the kiss, his eyes dark with desire. “You’re even more beautiful up close,” he murmured, his voice low and rough.

Anjie blushed.

He leaned in again, this time kissing her neck, his hands sliding up to cup her breasts thin fabric of her seifuku, touching he school girl bralette tits. Anjie’s head fell back, a soft whimper escaping her lips. I felt my own arousal building, but I forced myself to stay still, to just watch.

John’s hands slipped under the fabric, and I saw Anjie shiver as he touched her bare skin. He pulled back just enough to look into her eyes. “You’re perfect,” he whispered.

Anjie’s eyes fluttered shut, her lips parting as John’s hands continued to explore her body. The room seemed so quite that the soft and heavy breathing, the rustle of fabric, and the occasional moan from Anjie as John kissed and touched her seem deafening.

I sat in the chair, breathing fast, as if I were running up stairs, completely captivated by the scene unfolding in front of me. John’s hands moved lower, slipping beneath the waistband of her panties, and Anjie let out a gasp.",1,1748872470.0,Marik0Galsun,0,1.0,False

Both are done with school since last week. Since I'm a freelance Digital Marketing Manager I mostly work from home, and Mondays were actually a thing I'd look forward to. I would *finally* get a quiet and tiddy home, and I could work and/or run errands in peace and silence from 7:30am til they came home at 3PM.

Their dad (who I been married to for 11 years) and I separated about a month ago, so since he doesn't live in the house anymore the mayority of the time its just me stuck at home with both kids since I can't really do much with my oldest being autistic. He works a retail job, so the days he wouldn't work from noon to 9pm we would tend to the kids together and divide and conquer bedtime. Now it's mostly me the days he doesn't come over and/or takes the kids.

This last weekend I had them (and all week too with little moments were their dad came over), so I'm exhausted, overstimulated and overwhelmed af. And since school is over, instead of a relaxing Monday morning were I can drink my coffee in silence and work in peace, I have two kids at home making noises, fighting, asking me for shit, and making messes while *trying to work.* My youngest doesn't start summercamp until Wednesday, and my oldest is staying home with me since our fucked up government defunded Special Education programs where I'm from.

I truly hate my life, I hate that I'm the only one that has to bend to everyone's schedule so I can have alone time, leave the house, or do anything really. Before they started school, I was a stay-and-work-from-home-mom, so you can image the insanity that my life has been for the past couple of years... and *I AM SO DONE*. STBX works every day except Wednesdays, and a couple of Sundays off. The rest of the week he works either from 8am to 5pm, or from noon to 9pm... so his job is one of the many reason I asked for a divorce. I'm also the default parent, main provider (Yes, I also make more money), and of course, the one the runs the mental load, schedules, appointments, etc. My mom is the only family member that helps out with them, but she still works also. But at least she takes or cares for them whenever she can.

For the past almost 6 years, I've been super depressed and incredibly broken since becoming a mother. I get constant migraines, I'm almost always in a irritable mood, I always feel sick or very fatigued so I can barely function, I'm always behind in work and since I freelance I don't have a team to delegate things to, my cortisol levels are always high, my needs always come last, and I barely leave my house. I have obsessive thoughts like ""Why the fuck did I have kids?"" ""Why did I want a family?"" since everything in my life sucks so much since then. I truly hate motherhood in every way, I hate that my STBX just gets to do whatever without having to find childcare or help, while I have to keep mothering and running the show no matter what.

I've been up since 6:30am with both kids... It's 9:35AM and the day already feels like a lifetime. Summer is just beggining... and while typing this rant, I'm sobbing from the sadness and desperation I feel. And yes, I go to therapy once a week. It helps, but doesn't change how things function at home. I don't know how I'm going to survive this summer. I just hope better times are near...",4,1748872323.0,Parenting,3,1.0,False

1l1ik9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1l1ik9p/my_lo_is_a_professor_from_college_i_am_30_now_and/,My LO is a professor from college. I am 30 now and he was in my life from 18-20.,"When I was in college (18F), a married professor (35M) asked me to have coffee after class after learning that I was excommunicated from a high control religion (he asked in class if anyone was part of this religion). We chatted for about an hour and then he asked me back to his office. On the same occasion, he took me into an empty classroom (I wasn’t questioning why, I have CPTSD and was in a vulnerable stage in my life). I had no clue what he was going to do. He hugged me and held me. I remember not hugging him back, just with my arms next to my side, with a slow reaction time, and being confused. Thereafter, when I’d see him (I kept seeing him in class and in his office), he’d ask really personal questions (like tell me a secret nobody knows), and share some personal details with me (like how he doesn’t like his dad, when he first lost his virginity). The relationship progressed and he’d continue to invite me into classrooms, he’d press himself against me, but we’d never kiss or touch over clothes. One day, I was wearing a dress and we came across each other in the hallway. He quickly pulled me into a classroom and asked me to touch myself. I said no. He then asked if I wanted him to touch me (I froze, nothing happened). He’d tell me things like how I looked pretty that day, how I was going to be great and do great things. I graduated from the school and went onto a university. I ended up working at the college where he taught at for 2.5ish-3 years. I called him once early on when I started working there and he said we should meet up. I told him I didn’t think that was a good idea and he just said oh ok. That was the last time we talked for a while. Fast forward about 1-2 years later and I was married to someone I didn’t love (I wanted to get out of my abusive parents house), and moved across the country with him. While in that marriage, I fell in love with someone else and cheated (I ended up divorcing and moving back to the state I grew up in). I called the professor once when I was struggling while in the first marriage. We caught up for a few minutes and I shared with him the struggle I was going through (I don’t know why I called him. I didn’t have many friends and he understood the control of the religion). Once I ended up moving back to where I grew up, I called him one more time and we chatted for a few minutes, nothing really of significance). 

Fast forward 7 years later, I remarried, moved 4-5 hours driving away from where I grew up, and have not talked to the professor in 7 years. He always sat in the back of my mind, I’d replay moments that are deeply embedded still in my head, but not to such a frequent extent. One day, I went to visit my home town on a trip, and I was close to where I knew his house was. All of the memories came rushing back to me. A month later after that visit, I called him, after 7 years of not speaking. We were friendly enough, nothing special was said, he said if I’m back in town to let him know and we can have lunch. 

Half a year or so later, I’m back in town and reach out to him. He becomes really elusive when I reach out to him. It felt like it was not his idea to see me, but somehow that I now needed to chase him to see him. I ended up just going to his office during office hours. He acted like I was any other student. We talked for just about 15 minutes before I felt so uncomfortable and gaslighted that I excused myself. He was distant and condescending. 

I’ve been having a pretty terrible PTSD episode for months now (related to that time in my life, not so much him). But my mind has been finding the memories with him over and over again (I am not sure if it’s because they are “good” memories I can find of that period of life). Although, if I could go back and never have met him, or never have had that first coffee with him, I would. 

Anyways, I know it’s been years now, but I’m going crazy and I hate how much power it feels he has over me. I crave his validation, but also wish I could tell him how much of an asshole he really is. He won’t give me the time of day now. ",4,1748872263.0,limerence,0,1.0,False

I’ve been sitting with this feeling for a while now… it’s time to share my story.  
They say truth is stranger than fiction, and let me tell you—there’s no way I could’ve made this up even if I tried.

**Fair warning:** This isn’t just a roller coaster. It’s a flaming, no-brakes, loop-de-looping emotional demolition derby that ends in a spectacular mushroom cloud of karma.

Charlotte, thank you. You taught me how to embrace the art of being delightfully petty in the smallest, most satisfying ways. You helped me reconnect with the fierce, fiery version of myself I thought I’d lost forever. you've been my online friend at nights with your stories. 

They say life begins at 40.  
Well my dear petties… mine *detonated*.

But before we get to the explosion, let me take you back to where it all began…

Growing up, I loved fairy tales and happy endings. A hopeless romantic at heart, I was happy and content. Growing up i had a couple of boyfriends here and there, but nothing serious.  In my university days I loved the power play and play I did but nothing sexual just flirting and enjoying the attention I got.  For context: Imagine:  blonde hair, blue eyes, a dancer's physique with a six-pack and legs for days. I did ballet for most of my life and swam 2km a day. I wanted to be a ballerina more than anything. But just before I could start at the Art high school of my dreams… I broke my ankle. That was the end of the ballerina dream. And I had no backup plan.

After high school, I chose to study interior design. I loved it, *at first*. But in my second year, at the age of 20, I discovered alcohol and drugs. My head lecturer (who doubled as our dealer, by the way) told us that you can't design if you're not drunk or high. Before that, I was failing. After? Passing his class with flying colors.

From there it was a whirlwind of parties, wild nights, and eventual failure. I crashed hard, failed my second year, and hit my rock bottom. I begged my dad to let me change degrees and universities. He and my family never knew about my addictions.

I got clean. Started fresh. So I changed universities and my course to journalism. Attended classes. No partying. No alcohol. My new friends were the studious type — the “good girls.” But honestly? I was bored out of my mind.

Then I got invited to my former party buddy’s 21st birthday bash. It was wild. I drank (a lot), refused the drugs, but in my drunken state… I re-injured my ankle. That’s a story in itself, but I was on crutches for two weeks.

Still recovering, I got asked to another party but from a one of my “good gilrs”, one I didn’t want to go to. But my “good girl” friend begged me. And that night, I met *him*. The Prince Who Turned Into a Toad, Let’s call him D.

We were born in the same year, I was 21, he was 20, and he seemed like Prince Charming. he was extremely charming, funny and sweet. I fell *hard*. I introduced him to my parents and… they *hated* him.

D was in the military, which I admired, but where I’m from, there isn’t much of a future in that. His family couldn’t afford university, so he followed the family tradition. I, on the other hand, had a car in my second year, my parents paid my tuition, I knew I was fortunate. Not rich, just fortunate.

My parents forbade me from seeing him. I broke it off. But I loved him, and started seeing him in secret.

We made promises. He wanted to become a chef, and I swore I'd help him after my studies. A year into our relationship, I wrote my parents a letter pouring out my heart. Eventually, they tolerated him, for my sake.

Three years later, I got D accepted into the top culinary school in the country.  
He partied and failed but got a decent job offer, so he took it.  
We got engaged in his second year, six years into knowing each other.

Keep in mind that I paid for his studies and supported the two of us for 3 years financially.

But the cracks had already started forming. He began hanging out with party crowd and girls. He’d vanish during events, only to reappear casually, but I trusted him.

He knew about my history, but I had my drinking under control but I've had grown.  
But then, the emotional abuse began.

One night at a party, I was dancing, *just* normal dancing, nothing provocative, when he came up to me and hissed, “Stop acting like a wh@rE. Sit down.”  
I was shocked. I sat. We fought. He apologized.

But it happened again. And again. And again. But life otherwise was good. We started planning our dream wedding, but besides the emotional abuse, which was very subtle I did not recognize at the time, life was perfect in my eyes.

We got married exactly eight years after we met. A grand, beautiful wedding, 150 guests, everything perfect on the surface.

He lost jobs constantly. Spent nights out. And I, love-blinded and loyal, kept going.

He joined a motorcycle club. At first, I was skeptical, but eventually, I loved the club. They became family.

We tried to have children. I have PCOS. Seven miscarriages. Four of them I went through alone. No emotional support. No comfort. After the seventh, and several fertility treatments and I picked up a lot of weight, I said no more.

We moved provinces for one of his jobs. I had small successful business but had to leave it behind so that we could move. I hated it, far from family, no friends. But the club helped me build a community again.

Then it all started unraveling. The emotional abuse was subtle but more constant, the fat shaming even more, but it was there. I hated myself and the way I looked. But I was loyal and looked at him through rose glasses and life was perfect in my eyes.

At a club event, I was again told to “sit and be a wallflower.” I cried in the bathroom. The women comforted me. Then they asked: “Are you finally leaving D?”

I was *shocked*.

“He’s cheating,” they said.

I didn’t believe them. I *defended* him. When I asked him about it later, he said it was the club trying to come between us.

I believed him.

One night, we were lying in bed watching TV. He got a message, jumped up, got dressed, and left without a word. Wouldn’t answer my calls.

When he came back, he brought Miss M and her daughter. He said her husband was abusive and she needed a safe place to stay.

I had met her before, seemed sweet enough.

One week later, her *sister* moved into the flat on our property and hosted a thank-you BBQ. I sat next to D, and he looked at me and said, “Why are you sitting in Miss M’s place?”

I stood up. Walked away. And cried all night.

The next morning, her bedroom door was locked. D never came to our room. I knew.

I confronted him later that day. Calm. Collected. Asked four times before he finally admitted he was seeing someone else, but *not* Miss M (of course). Now Miss M, had 5 kids, from 4 different men and she did not have custody of any her kids … I leave it at that.

When I told him to get her out of my house, he shoved me against a wall, hand to my throat.

I locked him out of the bedroom. Called my new best friend, let’s call her BFF.

BFF picked me up at 5am Thursday morning. I packed my bag and walked out. I phoned my boss and explained everything, he said to take as much time as I needed. I asked for the two days Thursday and Friday to figure what I’m going to do. He agreed.

I told BFF everything. I cried. She made me do an advanced yoga class, I’ve never cried or sweated so much in my life. She refused to let me drink, and I’m grateful.

We met the girls from the club on Sunday. We had started a ladies-only biker social group. They were thrilled I had finally left D.

Back home, I mostly stayed between my room and my office, was working from home at that stage.  
Miss M would *sprint* away whenever I went downstairs to make myself something to eat or to make myself a cup of coffee. I drank about 20 cups of coffee that day, just to annoy her.

The next day, D and Miss M left. I did not know where to or for how long, but I did not care because it gave me piece and quite to start packing and moving out.

Two months after I left, I got a phone call from a very angry, aggressive man, let’s call him Mr O. ""Where the hell is D?"" he growled.

I barely knew Mr O. I’d met him once, but being the wallflower I was at the time, I never really got to know him. I told him straight: *I don’t know and I don’t care, but I’ll give you whatever info I have to help you find him.*

Turns out, D owed a lot of money to some very dangerous people, not the kind you want to mess with. Think mob-level dangerous. They hired Mr O to collect, but every time he got close, D disappeared.

Mr O, it turned out, was also a member of a motorcycle club, but from another province. I sent him everything I had on D, and from there, Mr O and I started talking more and more.

The divorce had moved along quickly, until a certain point. Then D blocked me on everything. The only way I could reach him was through Miss M. It made my blood boil every time I had to go through her.

One day Mr O and I were talking about the divorce, and I told him I was stuck. D was refusing to sign the final document I needed to get a court date. The next day, Miss M messaged me out of the blue: “Get the paper to the sheriff. D will sign.”

And just like that, I was divorced. Free. Finally able to start rebuilding.

I was happy. Content. I started chatting with a few guys, but every time a date was planned, the guy would either ghost me or cancel last-minute. One or two? Sure, life happens. But *four*? It felt off.

Then one day, one of the guys who cancelled called me. He said he owed me an explanation.  
“As soon as we made plans, I got a call,” he said. “Some guy told me I’d regret it if I went on the date with you.”

I just stared at my phone. Speechless.

Then Mr O called. I told him what happened. He asked me to contact one of his, Mr O, friends who could check my phone. Turns out, D had *cloned my phone,* and was calling these men, threatening them.

Then the creepy calls started. Strange men calling me, saying things like, *“I’m your next husband,”* in the most provocative, unsettling tones.

I called Mr O. Gave him the numbers. The calls stopped soon after.

But it got worse. Three break-in attempts at my cottage. The last time, they even tried the main house. When the owners confronted them, the men ran off saying, *“It’s not her.”*

I told Mr O.

Apparently, D had told Nigerian drug dealers, whom he owed money to, that I had stolen drugs and cash from him. He told them if they wanted their stuff, to come find me.

Mr O handled it. Again.

I moved back to the province I came from, closer to family and safer. Mr O and I started dating.

He was a big, friendly giant of a man, mean as hell when it was deserved, but kind, respectful, and protective. I fell in love. Mr O reintroduced passion in my life. Passion for living and doing what you love and in other ways.... He also taught me how to stand up for myself. We moved in together and started planning our future.

Mr O had a dream: to bring real American moonshine to our country. He’d lived in Appalachia, with moonshiners, and learned everything. We took every cent we had and built a still. We started making moonshine together, and I found my passion.

Fermentation. Distillation. The science behind it. I was finally doing something I *loved*.

Mr O proposed, no big romantic gesture. Just the two of us, talking. And it was perfect.

He started working abroad  so that we can save money for our dream distillery. But on one of those trips, he got malaria, and unexpectedly passed away.

Have you ever felt your heart and soul shatter into a billion pieces while screaming ""NO!"" over the phone? That was me. My world stopped. I was still breathing, but I was dead inside.

At that stage in my life, in the last 3 and half years have I been divorced and “widowed”. And saw no happiness or a future for myself.

Depression swallowed me whole. I lost my job. I stayed with a friend. I cried so much one day I couldn't breathe, and I started praying to just *stop* breathing.

That was my wake-up call.

That same day, a friend called. Said Mr O, just before he left on his last trip, had set up a meeting with an investor before he died. It was scheduled for the next week.  
“Do you still want to take the meeting?” they asked.

I did.

Immediately I phoned my parents. Moved in with them. I heard Mr O’s voice in my head: *“You’ve got this.”*

So I decided to pull myself together. Because Mr O’s legacy—*our* legacy—*would live on through moonshine*.

The meeting went extremely well. There are some delays, major red tape, but I saw that as a blessing. I needed time to find myself again.

I was still close to the motorcycle club. I spent weekends with them. Some of the guys were interested, but the club has strict rules about dating the Ol’Lady of a brother, even after a breakup or death. I was protected by that code.

And to be honest,I wasn’t interested.

I remember standing in the clubhouse one night, looking around at the guys, and asking myself, *""Do I see myself with any of them?""* The answer was *no*.

One weekend, I decided not to go to the clubhouse. I stayed home with my parents instead, just craving conversation with someone outside the usual circle. So, on a whim, I downloaded a dating app. I scrolled a bit on Friday and started a few conversations, but honestly, I wasn’t impressed.

Then Saturday morning came, and there it was, a message from someone. Let’s call him *King*. We started chatting… and never really stopped. That first day, we talked for 17 hours straight first on the app and later on whats app. We connected instantly, in a way I can’t explain. It felt like we were old souls who had somehow found each other again. I told him my whole life story, and he told me his. We were strangers, but it felt like we already knew each other.

That was the beginning of a love story I never expected.

King built me up again. He complimented me, encouraged me, and gave me confidence I hadn’t felt in a long time. He arranged a weekend away at a lodge for our first meeting. I was cautious, of course, I even had a few bikers on speed dial in case things went sideways, but the moment we met, I knew: this was the person I was supposed to spend the rest of my life with.

I introduced him to my parents, and they adored him. For the first time in my life, I had a boyfriend they truly liked. After just two months, he asked me to move in with him. At the time, I had no job, no house, just a container full of furniture and two spoiled little dogs. He had a farm, a stable job, and a steady income.

I initially said no. I’d always paid my own way, and I was still grieving Mr O.

King knew all of this, yet he kept reassuring me: “Let me take care of you.” I couldn’t stay with my parents forever, they lived in a retirement village, and while the council had made an exception for me, three months was already pushing it.

After many long talks, I took King up on his offer and I moved in.

He supported me through every tear, every breakdown, every moment I was still mourning Mr O. Not just emotionally, but financially as well. I became a “housewife” for the first time in my life, and I absolutely hated it. I started planting herbs on the farm I needed for distilling, I job-hunted in town, but nothing sparked my passion.

I felt conflicted, like I was betraying Mr O, like I was cheating on him, but he knew he was no longer on this earth and I knew a part of me will always love him. But the truth was, I wasn’t just in love with King… I was falling *deeper* in love with him every single day.

King took my shattered heart and soul and began gluing the pieces back together, one by one. He gave me strength, hope, and most of all, he reignited the fire in me for what I loved most: passion for life and gave me the freedom to start exploring it more.

We started experimenting with moonshine recipes, working late into the nights on new ideas. Eventually, we perfected our whiskey, more of a bourbon really, we and took a bottle to our investor. He was impressed.

The red tape is finally clearing, and any day now, we expect the funding to come through so that we can build our dream distillery. King has got the upmost respect for Mr O and believe in the legacy.

But I couldn’t just wait. So I took another leap, with the support from King, I launched a YouTube channel, sharing my passion with the world. I teach people how to make homemade fruit wines. If you had told me six years ago that the scared, silent wallflower I was would one day be confidently have a YouTube channel… I would’ve laughed.

And guess what? Five years after I left D, Miss M left him too, for another man, like you always say: *you lose them how you got them.* Then, out of the blue, D sent me a Facebook friend request. I laughed and took immense joy in blocking him on every platform. I always knew he’d crawl out of the woodwork eventually, but I didn’t expect it to be *that* soon.

King and I have been in a relationship now, for 2 and half years and I could not be happier or confident in my life. I'm still overweight but King make me feel beautiful everyday. We support one another and our relationship is days filled with belly laughter, dancing in the kitchen, and just soppy romance. I finally know what love is supposed to be and it's the best feeling in the world. We aren’t engaged yet, but we will be. One day. We are saving up to have the wedding of the both deserve. For now, I’m living the best version of my life. And it’s all thanks to my incredible friends and family who carried me through my darkest days, Mr O that gave me passion again, and to King, who gave me his heart, his home, and the strength to start living again.

So the moral of this long, winding story?  
Never give up hope.  
You truly never know what’s waiting for you just around the corner

Now, Karma, she’s a different kind of B-word. After I left D, I don't hear much about him what but I've heard through the grapevine. At first there was rumor that Miss M was pregnant with his child, turns out to be fake news, just a way to try and hurt me. But what was confirmed is that he lost everything. He and Miss M ended up living under a bridge at one point. Some very dangerous people are after him now, these days, and they are running for their lives and consistently looking over their shoulder.

D’s living with his mother, the only person in his life that will speak with him. The rest of his family? They’ve disowned him. Even his ""friends"" the people he was once closest to have turned their backs.

But me? I may have gone through hell and back, but I came out stronger, fiercer, and more focused than ever before.

I’m ready now.

these, like said, aren’t worth that much but there are some goodies and some good outfits makers/peices PLUS buying in bulk gives you a really good deal, and you might be able to sell some of these for more than what i’m willing to sell for :) again, trying to GET RID OF THIS STUFF!

Now I tried doing without ""shop water"". But I'm wary of keeping mere filtered water from a jug filter in a room-temperature brew for a day. So, I boiled water, put it into the French press, kept it there overmight to cool, then added coffee, stirred it with a plastic spoon (sterilized by boiling water) and left it for \~22 hours again. Same ratio, same grind.

The result is rather less concentrated, workable as a 2:1 dilution (2 coffee to 1 water/oatmilk) or neat.

Why could this happen? And might there be a way to get the ""shop water"" result with home water?

# Background

I (M34), started running without any clear structure or plan in the spring 2021. My initial goal was to run 10 kilometers under 40 minutes, a goal which I achieved thanks to a Garmin Coach plan by november that same year. After that I set my goals on my first marathon, Stockholm Marathon 2022. Yet again, I trained without any clear plan, but upped my milage. As many before me, I ran my runs too hard, and always at similar paces. Needless to say, I crashed and burned, running my first marathon in 3:27:xx, hitting the wall hard at mile 20.

Even so, I was hooked. And I had heard about the alluded sub 3 hour dream in the marathon distance. I registered to Stockholm Marathon 2023 straight after finishing the 2022 edition of the race. Around this time I started reading up on ""the maffetone method"", So I trained only in zone 2 for half a year in order to prepare myself for a pfitz 18/70 Marathon plan. I got through the plan, but often times fell short on his tempo workouts. I simply could not hold that speed he required for the entire duration. This showed in my first sub 3 attempt where I was somewhat on track half way with a 1:29 split before crashing and burning finishing in 3:10:xx.

I was determined though and signed up for Valencia Marathon later that year and continued training during the summer. I jumped on to another round of pfitz 18/70, this time nailing all workouts, but feeling increasingly burnt out mentally of running 100+ km weeks month after month.

Then... A month out from Valencia, BOOM. My hip started hurting like nothing else during a medium long run. A trip to the MRI and PT a week later confirmed, femoral neck stress fracture on the compression side, with a fracture line 80% through the bone.

Needless to say, I was devastated. I was out of running for 3 months+ before starting a gradual return to running program, I even managed to keep up with tradition and run Stockholm Marathon, albeit at a slower pace, finishing comfortably at 3:21:xx (I was cross training a lot on my bike, and running around 40 km/week.

And this is where our story begins!

# Trainings

The prep for Stockhom Marathon began already October last year for me. After being on reduced milage for a year due to my stress fracture, and taking 2 weeks off after finishing my last race (a XC of 30 km) I started base building in preperation for the real marathon prep. I averaged 60-70 km/week between october and January. making sure to have at least 2 heavy lower body gym sessions/week as well to make my body more resistant to injury (pre fracture, I never strength trained...). I also had a ultra distance cross country skii race on the calendar at the end of February, so between January and February I also did around 200 km XC skiing. I gradually incoporated quality in my easy base building program. First adding strides a couple of times a week, then, in December, adding 5-6x1 k @ 5 k pace on a treadmill. I wanted to have a safe and gradual buildup and not burn too quick and too fast and re-injure myself.

I In February I jumped on a Daniels 2Q program. I was done with pfitz. I always hated his medium long runs, they felt like a chore and I always questioned why I should run so long in those ""in the middle"" paces. I thought it would be a better use of my time to simply have the workouts within the MLR and LR. This is where my first setback struck. 2 weeks before my XC skii race, and 4 weeks in the 2Q program I woke up with limited control and burning pain in my left leg. I was diagnosed with piriformis syndrome. This quickly also led to my foot showing symptoms of plantar fasciitis due to my calf and ancle not working properly.

I shut everything down running-wise, returning to bike training. After persistent rehabbing and taping of the foot I started running again with 13 weeks to go to my marathon. The foot still hurt like hell to run on but was gradually trending better. As the weeks passed, I was finding my groove. I mostly stuck to the plan 2Q plan, but with somewhat reduced milage hoovering between 90-105 kilometers for 12 weeks straight. The difference from before is that even though the workouts were tough, I always managed to complete them. one month before my marathon, I did a tuneup half, aiming for 1:24:30, a pb of 2 minutes (I wanted to hit sub 1:25 to gain confidence for the full distance. I used it as a form check in for the marathon as well as a workout. I managed to ace the tune-up, finishing in the low 1:24s. I was finally starting to gain a good amount of confidence.

An adjustment I made to the out of the box 2Q plan was to reduce the amount of milage ran each week. I supplemented this for a bike ride or two every other week to have a more varied training approach. I also reduced the strength regiment from large compound exercises to more running focused single leg exercises with kettlebells in order to maintain rather than increase strength.

The last month or so before tapering, I made sure to up my fueling practice, During this period I also for the first time tried out a brand new supplement, nomio (highly recommend). Come taper, I was for the first time ever really confident I would be able to hit my goal of 2.5 years, to run Stockholm Marathon in under 3 hours. The work was done, I was in the shape of my life.

# Pre-race

I woke up way before my alarm. But had slept soundly throughout the night. I had carb loaded with pasta and rice based food for 2.5 days so for breakfast I had my go to food for race-days; overnight oats. I chilled throughout the morning, zipping some coffee and maurtens caffeinated pre-workout drink. Two hours and twenty minutes before the gun, I took a shot of nomio before traveling to the starting area. I arrived there 1.5 hours before the gun.

Stockholm is quite a hilly course, with 230 meters of elevation gain, and the race always starts at lunch which makes the temperatures go quite high sometimes. This was promising to be one of the cooler iterations of the race, with temperatures around 20 degrees Celsius. I had programmed a pace-pro program on my Garmin which aimed for a slight positive split of around 1:28:30 half since most of the elevation gain is on the back-half of the race, making this course quite tricky to run on a good time because of the risk of a heavy blow up during the last half if you go out too fast at the start, burning too many candles.

# Race

For the first time ever, I actually managed to get a starting spot next to the 3 hour pace group. Originally I had planned to run the course using my Pace Pro. But I made the quick adjustment to follow the sub 3 pace group (but with my pace-pro still active).

The gun went off. And away we went! I settled into pace, making sure to hover 10 meters or so behind the pacegroup the entire time. I quickly settled into a rhythm. taking a gel every 3-5th mile depending on how the stomach felt. The pacers seemed to have more or less the same strategy as me, albeit a bit more agressive. But I felt strong and coinfident to stick with them.

That was... Until after the 22th kilometer mark. Because that's where I decided to actually pass them! Until then the pacegroup had been quite chaotic during the water stations, often times I was close to tripping on someone, or running into someone else. But as I felt so strong, had my pacepro to fall back on. I was feeling more and more confident that I was for once not going to blow up, and I had banked enough time to be able to fall back on my positive split.

kilometer 22-32 was my favorite part. I was cruising mostly by myself, with only a handful of people in front or behind me. I could really take in the crowds, interact with them, listening to the music being played along the course. I began passing people who reminded me of how my previous marathons had been during the second half. Tough and way slower than the opening half. With the passing of each person, I felt even stronger. I was enjoying this so much.

As I hit the 35 kilometer mark, things started to become a bit more tough and fatigue had started to creep in, and I suddenly had a sharp pain flare up in my left big toe and my shoe was colored in blood. My nail had given way. Even so, I managed to push trough all of this taking my last gel at kilometer 38 for a final boost. I even managed to maintain a decent pace all the way until finish. I made sure to interact and cheer with the crowd the entire home straight even doing a couple of nice poses for the cameramen! After 2.5 years of training, setbacks and grit, I had finally managed to go Sub 3 hours.

# Post-race

After the race I was filled with so much joy. I first met up with my friends who also did the race and chilled with them for a bit. Then with my Girlfriend who had cheered me on throughout the day. The legs were of course sore, and my stomache constantly cramping after all of the gels etc.

As for reflections. Even though I did not follow the 2Q plan to a T, I feel like the adjustments I made did not really impact at least my performance, on the day of the race, I feel like almost everything went perfect. The shoes, the training, the nutrition, Nomio supplement, everything came together in a perfect way.

As to new goals, of course I want to run an even faster marathon. But after running Stockholm 4 times, I feel like it is finally time for an easier course (somewhere else). So I have already registered for Copenhagen marathon next year. Until then, I will do a modified hansons advanced half program starting sometime during summer in order to go sub 1:20 on the half (this is a B race), and a 100 k ultra marathon a week later. Both of these races will take place during the fall.

But for now. I will just rest a couple of weeks and reset body and mind.

1l1ic5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1l1ic5c/my_friendship_fell_apart_after_she_met_my_bf/,My friendship fell apart after she met my bf,"My (25F) friend, Kay (25F), and I were best friends and especially grew close in last 2 years. A year ago I began dating my boyfriend who I adore and is honestly a great guy. Treats me well, doesn't shy away from showing affection to me in his cute ways (he is an IT guy while I am more of creative mind which works as great balance). Kay was very excited to meet him when I first announced we are dating. Eventually Kay and her boyfriend did meet him. Both me and Kay hoped this would turn into a group hangouts. 
Anyway after she met my bf, we graduated. I began studying at another city 3 and half hours away from where we live and began working part-time from home as student. She got a full-time job to which she had hard time adjusting to. Eventually our hangouts, as one might assume, became less frequent. We would meet up for coffee and she would leave after an hour. Even if we didn't see each other for say 10+ days. My schedule changed a lot. 
Here is what my weekend looks like when I have classes (twice a month usually): on Friday I travel in the morning to arrive to classes at 4:00 PM and last until 8:00 PM. Then I sleep there and wake up at 7:00 AM and have classes mostly 9:00 AM until 3:00 PM. Then I go on bus at 4:30 PM and arrive home at 8:00 PM with my bf waiting for me at bus station. We go home, order food or he makes something and fall asleep at decent hour. I am also quite tired when I arrive and just don't feel like going anywhere but home. And throughout the week, I wake up at 6:30-7:00 AM so I can work and get shit done. I usually work in morning and study or do whatever I have in the afternoon. 
So my social life kind of suffered due to this. I don't see my friends as frequently and I always tell them Monday-Thursday and Sundays afternoon work best for me. But I just don't feel like going out to drink anymore like I used to with Kay. My boyfriend doesn't either, but he encourages me to hang out with my friends and to go out if I wish to. If I didn't have sleepovers with him, I would hardly see anybody really bc ofc everyone works or has classes, no biggie, just life. I accepted my new life which also took me some time. I got mono 6 months ago and since then, I especially don't really drink alcohol anymore. 
Anyway Kay confronted me couple of months ago about feeling abandoned and like I adjusted my life to my bf. While I may prioritize him more (I am aware of honeymoon phase), I found it shocking how she accused me of such thing because I really believe I tried my best to navigate everything I have. We had a long conversation to which I promised her I will try my best and apologized about it. As I said, I used to hang out with her and her bf a lot before and I really wanted all of us to hang out. I tried my best to use free weekends and plan ahead both for me and my bf. After the confrontation I asked her almost every weekend for hangouts. With busy lifes ofc it didn't really happen but in general, I was the one who wanted all of us to hangout while Kay would occationally ask for 2 of us to grab coffee. At one point I gave up and decided to let her initiate more. Then we didn't talk for 2 weeks until I texted her to ask how is she. 
We met up for coffee again and she said she still isn't happy (also neither am I) and nothing changed. She still believes I adapted to my bf. By that point my bf met all of my friends and everyone liked him. I have other very close friend Lea that gave me a deep insight on how he is and that he is a great guy (her opinion and from what I told her). Another good friend Mia told me he is more quiet, but he eventually relaxed and talked (that friend can't hide when she dislikes someone so I trust her). 
Kay pointed out that he is a great and polite guy, but that she feels like she is boring to him because he doesn't ask her questions. They met up 4 times in 1 year. Lea met with him twice and Mia spent plently of time with us for 2 weekends. 
Anyway Kay said she wants to meet him and claims she did initiate hangouts with him. But honestly, I was far more engaged in that and she would suggest some hangouts without actually organizing anything. I planned a fucking dinner and she just threw in ideas about going to pub quiz or going to caffe bar. She would just say to invite her if we plan on going there. I was mostly the one asking if her and her bf are available for certain day and if they want to go xyz. She said how she thinks I don't engage or show will to hangout at all. When she told me what she thought of my bf and I told her she is the only one seeing an issue, she said she is the most honest friend I have ever had basically dismissing all other friends I have in my life. She also dislikes Lea and will not take her word as anything valuable. I told her she made me insecure about it and she never apologized about it. She didn't apologize for anything. Only justified her behavior with explanations.  I told her she hurt me, cried in front of her because I couldn't handle it anymore, but she said I misunderstood her and that is what she gets for being honest. I will admit that at last coffee I did yell at her for short time when she accused me of something. She silenced me saying she refuses to be yelled at and that I am being immature. I apologized about it. And apologized about plenty of other things.  
I just... am exhausted. I don't trust her. She claims she is the most honest friend I have. Yet I question why does she wait for long time to say shit. When I think of her, I feel hurt and gradually I feel numb and not like she is my friend, let alone best friend. The more I think about us, the more I feel like ending it. 
I asked her what she wants from me and from us. She said she has no idea. Does she want me to be the old me that rushes to her and will accomodate her to max? To be fine with last minute plans and her changing her mind on spot? Back before I met my bf, I was studying at field that didn't interest me and I took every chance to get out of apartment and drink alcohol. I was not really happy with my life and now I am happy with what I am building and I can see brighter future for myself. Hell I was even depressed at one point and wanted to end it because I thought I was a failure. But now... everything is different. I am also meeting my bf's friends and I can understand Kay might be offended by me not hanging out frequently like before. But I still don't understand if I am an asshole for this. 
I know I wasn't the best of friends, but I really tried my best with what I could offer with my new life. Idk what she wants and obviously she doesn't either. Any advice would be welcome. Ask me any question for more info. Thank you. 
Also I am sorry this post is a mess, I am just so tired and overwhelmed. I am very eager to hear someone else's opinion because other friends told me that Kay is not being best of friends.

It was never intended to be passed down, but circumstances changed and no one ended up using the furniture for years until my grandmother, who only used it for a couple of years. The table was still in great shape and we didn't have one, so I took it after her.

The truth is, it’s been so long that the edges of those memories have blurred. I couldn’t tell you what our first conversation was about, or if we even had one. One day, he was just there, quietly orbiting around me like a shadow, and somehow, he never left.

Back then, he was a quiet kid. The kind who didn’t need to speak much to be noticed. By the time we actually talked, really talked, it felt like I’d known him forever. The other kids at school weren’t always kind, but with Carter around, it never really got to me. He was always there for me.

In high school, he had my back during fights. In college, when I felt like I didn’t belong anywhere, he stayed close. He was there when my marriage fell apart, when I thought no one else would be. Carter was the one constant. The only person I could truly rely on.

We ended up sharing a tiny two-bedroom apartment in a run-down complex downtown. The place reeked of cat litter and something sharp, like ammonia, that never faded, no matter how many air fresheners the landlord installed. Still, we made it work. We had each other, and that was enough.

After I lost my job, I spent countless late nights at the kitchen table with Carter. I’d ramble about anything and everything, and he’d sit there quietly, coffee in hand, offering a comment here and there, just enough to keep me going. He’s always been the best listener. His thoughts usually mirror mine, like we share the same internal rhythm. Not that he never challenged me, he did, but even then, it always felt like we were on the same page with one another.

One late night, during an otherwise forgettable weekend, Carter sat across from me, sipping his coffee. He looked up and said, “That place was too small for you anyway. You deserve more than what that company ever gave you.” His voice lingered in the air, gentle but firm, like the steam curling up from his mug. “They never deserved someone as good as you.”

I later mentioned that to my therapist. She gave me a tight-lipped look and scribbled something into her notebook. She told me I was projecting. I asked her what exactly I was supposed to be projecting onto, and she launched into this carefully worded explanation about co-dependence and emotional boundaries, how I’d supposedly built my world around Carter.

I didn’t let her finish. I stood up and walked out before she could say another word.

Turns out, before this session, she had gotten in touch with my emergency contacts. None of them had anything good to say about Carter. Not a single person. This was a betrayal, one I never even saw coming.

After that, I stopped going to therapy. I blocked my friends. Cut off anyone who made me feel like I had to justify my loyalty. I even called my mom, hoping, maybe, she’d understand. But all she said was, “He’s been in your life for years. Don’t you think it’s time you tried to separate from him?”

That conversation didn’t last long.

Carter was my best friend. He’d never hurt me. Never let me down. And yet the people who claimed to love me had nothing but suspicion and warnings to offer. I wasn’t just angry, I was livid. Furious in a way that made my skin feel too tight. When I got home, Carter was right where I expected him to be, sitting at the kitchen table, coffee in hand. I launched into a full-blown rant, unloading everything the therapist had said. He didn’t interrupt, didn’t flinch. He just listened, steady as ever, letting me burn through the rage. He never made me feel like a fool for any of it. “What would they know, anyway?” he said, his voice low but sure. “It’s not like anyone else has been here for you. Great things are waiting. You just have to be patient. It’ll find you.”

Carter’s always had a way of pulling me back from the edge. He could take something bleak and stretch it into something manageable, sometimes even hopeful. Like when we were kids, and he slept over for the first time. We built this huge blanket fort in my room, trying to make the night feel like something special. In reality, the fort was barely more than a single worn bed sheet and a heavy blanket I used year-round because it was the only one we had. The thing had holes in it, but somehow those became windows to an imaginary world. Carter never once complained. I never went to his house. He always said it wasn’t worth visiting, that it was in worse shape than mine. I never pushed him on it. But ever since that therapy session, Carter’s been different. There’s a dullness to him now, like someone turned the volume down on who he used to be. He was never loud or overly animated, but he had this quiet confidence, this warmth that filled the room. Lately, it feels like that warmth has been leaking out, little by little.

The first time I realized something might really be wrong was over breakfast. Mornings are my favorite time of day. Cooking is one of the few things that brings me real joy, so I like to take my time with it: laying out the plates, setting the table just right. That morning was no different, until I looked down and noticed I had set three plates.

Three.

I stood there, just staring at them. The plates were spotless, gleaming in the morning light. I couldn’t remember placing the third one. Couldn’t explain it. It just…was there. And for a moment, I couldn’t breathe.

As I cleared the extra setting from the table, I kept trying to piece together when I could’ve put it down. I’ve followed the same morning routine for years, same motions, same rhythm, and I couldn’t remember ever making that kind of mistake before. Maybe I was still half-asleep. Morning haze could do strange things to memory, right? We have four chairs at our little dining table, but only two ever get any use. It’s not like Carter and I entertain guests.

When I mentioned the third plate to him, he gave a shrug and a reassuring smile.  “I’m sure it’s just morning grogginess,” he said. “Don’t overthink it. You should try starting your day with coffee sometime—might help shake the sleep off.” He took a sip from his mug as he spoke, and I found myself frowning. “When did you even make that?” I asked. “You were in the kitchen with me the whole time.”

He smiled, that same half-playful smirk he always uses when he’s dodging something. “I have my ways,” he said, raising the cup in a mock toast.

I rolled my eyes and went back to cleaning up. Maybe he was right. Maybe I was making something out of nothing. I hadn’t slept well the night before, and that could’ve thrown me off more than I realized. The downstairs neighbors were restless again. Our building has paper-thin walls, and last night the noise seeped through every surface. A low, indistinct murmur of voices, just loud enough to know someone was talking, but never clear enough to make out the words. That might’ve been fine, annoying, but tolerable, if not for the scratching.

It started around midnight. At first, I thought they were moving furniture, maybe packing for a move. But the longer it went on, the more it sounded... deliberate. Less like dragging and more like clawing. Not from the floor below us either, it was coming from the wall. From Carter’s wall. His bedroom shares a wall with mine, and I figured maybe there’s an exposed pipe running up from below. Maybe some kind of vibration was traveling through the plumbing. That had to be it. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that whatever it was, it wasn’t coming from beneath us. It was coming from beside me.

I know for a fact it’s not Carter. He’s quieter than a mouse, always has been. Not once have I heard a sound come from his room. Sometimes it’s eerie how silent he can be. But then again, that’s part of what makes him such a good roommate. When I mentioned the noise, he shrugged like it was nothing. “No, I didn’t hear anything last night. Maybe the quiet just got to you?”

And when I said the scratching was coming from the wall between our rooms, he didn’t even blink. “Nope. Didn’t hear a thing.” He took another sip from his coffee, calm as ever. From that night on, the disturbances didn’t stop. They became constant, scratching, murmuring, a pressure in the walls. But Carter? He never heard a thing.

One evening, the rain came down in sheets, thick enough to erase the sky. The kind of rain that makes you think about flash floods and emergency kits. Carter and I sat by the window in silence, watching the storm unfold. From our apartment, I looked down at the street below like an unseen observer, detached from the world moving beneath us.

Cars rolled through deep puddles, spraying water onto the sidewalks. A few people with umbrellas braved the storm, fighting against the wind—and losing. Every gust bent them sideways. It all felt so... small from up here. So far away.

I traced a raindrop down the window with my fingertip. It left a faint trail of condensation that vanished a moment later. Carter stayed at the windowsill, unmoving, his gaze fixed on the storm.

Eventually, I left him there and turned to something more productive. I had a few old boxes buried in the closet I’d been meaning to go through: keepsakes, junk, forgotten pieces of myself. A rainy evening felt like the right time.

I changed into an old t-shirt and knelt in front of the closet, ready to sort through whatever dusty memories were waiting for me. Inside were the usual odds and ends from high school. My old track jersey, technically stolen, I guess, but it was senior year. Did they really expect me to give it back? A few worn journals from when I thought I might have some artistic talent. I tried, but it never really stuck.

I flipped through the pages. Most were blank. A few were filled with doodles: cartoon characters from childhood, animals drawn with surprising care. There were also graphite sketches, messy and dark, from a phase where I thought smudged shadows and dramatic eyes meant depth. To be honest, some of them still held up. The shading. The weight of expression. I gave myself credit where it was due. A small smile crept across my face as I kept flipping through.

There’s a section from when I tried to draw my friends for practice. Izzie was my first victim; her head was drawn too circular, and her hair was barely detailed with nothing more than a few scratches of my pencil. Then there was Vincent, who was even worse. Lastly, Carter appeared. I raised my eyebrow as I stared at it. He’s got short buzzed hair and a big button nose, along with some braces marked onto his teeth. 

Carter? This looks nothing like Carter. I don’t recall him ever having braces. I don’t think he’s ever had hair that short either, he also has black hair and not light hair like the drawing makes it out to be. I placed the drawing to the side and make a note to mention it to him later. Maybe I put his name there by accident? I continue going through the box and come across a binder full of old photos my Mom must have printed out. Oh boy, I have no idea what embarrassing moments these could contain. The first few pages are standard childhood photos: there’s one from when I was in the cradle in the hospital, my first ever picture, another from Kindergarten, a team photo from my youth Football team. I went through every single one, enjoying my stroll through memory lane.

Names and faces come pouring into my memory all at once, I can’t believe how much I’ve forgotten over the years. But then again, I guess that’s what age and a deteriorating mental health will get you. As we get to my middle school pictures, I begin to notice a common trend. There are a few birthday pictures I examine, and just as I remember, there weren’t many kids in attendance. What catches me off guard about this is that Carter isn’t in a single photo. I know for a fact he was at my tenth birthday party, he was on my laser tag team.  It was one of the rare times my parents could afford to take me out to play the game. I remember that day vividly, the laughter, the lights, the sharp click of tokens in my hand. That memory still feels real. Solid.

Later, while digging through an old box of keepsakes, I found a photo from my middle school graduation. We were all lined up in the auditorium, a small class, no more than sixty of us. Smiling faces, slouched shoulders, awkward posture. But Carter… Carter wasn’t in the picture.

I stared at it for a long time. I *knew* he was there that day. We’d stood right next to each other during the ceremony, whispering about how the principal's fly had been down the entire time. I laughed. He laughed. It *happened*. But in the photo, there’s just a gap. A strange, too-wide space between me and the kid on my right. Like someone had been erased.

I shook off the unease and kept sorting through the box: old notebooks, broken keychains, a crumpled birthday card from my aunt. Eventually, I separated everything into two piles: keep, discard. Task done, I returned to the window. Outside, not much had changed. Rain streaked down the glass in lazy trails. And Carter was still there, silent, gazing down at the street below like he was waiting for something.

“I found an old graduation photo from middle school,” I said, keeping my voice light. “You’re not in it.”

He didn’t turn around. “I’m not exactly the most photogenic person. Probably just out of frame,” he replied, flatly. “Surprised you dug all that up.”

I hesitated, then handed him the sketch I’d drawn years ago. His face, the way I remembered it back then.

Carter frowned. Deeply. His eyes scanned the drawing, then narrowed. “That’s not me,” he said. “I never had braces. And I never wore my hair short.” He turned back to the window, the conversation dead in the air. I stood there for a moment longer, unsure of what to say. There was something cold in the room now, something just behind his voice. I gave him space. There was still a lot to do around the apartment, and the rain wasn’t going to stop anytime soon.

Later that night, after Carter and I had retreated to our rooms, I noticed a trash bag in the bin that hadn’t been there earlier. I hesitated, guilt tightening in my chest, but my eyes drifted toward Carter’s closed door. Curiosity won out.

As quietly as I could, I opened the bag. Inside were all the middle school photos, creased, crumpled, some torn clean down the middle. At the very bottom, my sketch of Carter lay ripped in half, the face split perfectly between the eyes.

I stood there for a moment, unsure of what to feel. Then, without a word, I folded the bag closed and returned to my room. I had barely shut the door before the scratching in the walls began again. It was louder this time.

The dining table became a problem.

Every morning before breakfast, I’d wake to find it perfectly set for three. Matching plates, neatly placed forks, and folded napkins. At dinner, the same. Always three settings. Carter swore he wasn’t doing it, and I knew I wasn’t either. Still, the third place would appear, no matter how often I cleared it. By the end of the first week, I’d had enough. I dragged the two extra chairs out to the curb, just old furniture now, free to whoever wanted them. But the next morning, all four chairs were back, arranged like they had never been moved. When I asked Carter about it, he only shrugged. “I thought you kept changing your mind,” he said.

By mid-September, I was drinking. A lot. Carter said it would help with the dreams, the ones where the walls pulsed like lungs and the floor stretched and sighed beneath my feet. In the worst of them, my skin peeled away in strips, soft and clean like wax paper.

The scratching in the walls never stopped. It grew more desperate, like whatever was inside was clawing at something deeper than drywall. I told myself it was rats, even when I stopped believing it. At night, just before sleep, I started to hear whispers. Faint, unintelligible, but insistent, mouthing words against the fabric of the room.

They weren’t speaking *to* me.

They were speaking *about* me.

Carter talked to me a lot during that time. “You just need to sleep,” he’d whisper at night, perched at the edge of my bed like he belonged there. His voice was gentle, almost kind, but it never comforted me. Once, I asked him if he ever slept. He didn’t answer. Just sat there, still and watching, until I drifted off.

One morning, I woke to the sharp, ear-splitting buzz of the doorbell. The sound tore through my skull like a siren, pulling me up from some thick, dreamless place. Half-dressed in wrinkled pajamas, I staggered to the window and looked down at the entrance to our building. Two police officers stood just outside, shifting awkwardly on their feet.

Then the intercom crackled: *“This is a wellness check. We need to speak with the resident in Unit 3C.”*

A jolt of cold ran down my spine.

I didn’t answer. I didn’t move, at first. Then, heart hammering, I scrambled to the closet and pulled out the hammer I kept for fixing loose nails and broken drawer handles. I held it in both hands, raised above my head, and crept toward the front door.

Behind me, Carter’s voice returned, low, urgent. “It’s a trap. They’re here for me. They want to take me away from you.”

I froze, still as the dead. The buzzer rang again. And again. But I didn’t open the door. I couldn’t. Somewhere deep down, a sliver of doubt rushed to the surface, but Carter crushed it before it could fully form.

“It was that no-good therapist of yours,” he said, voice simmering with quiet fury. “Maybe even your mother, too.”

He sounded so sure.

So calm.

I took his word for it.

Days later, I woke to find the word LIAR gouged into the ceiling above my bed. Deep, jagged scratches had torn through the plaster, curling the paint like dried skin. Dust flaked down onto my pillow like dandruff from something diseased. I blinked hard, heart thudding, then slowly raised my hands. My fingernails were cracked. Torn. Red seeped from the beds of my nails, sticky and caked with dried blood.

That morning, Carter stared at me over the rim of his coffee mug.

“You need to get rid of them,” he said.

I blinked at him, still dizzy from the ceiling. “Who?”

“The ones poisoning you.”

Time lost its structure. I couldn't tell whether I was dreaming or awake anymore. Sometimes I’d find the third chair in my bedroom, right at the foot of the bed. I’d wake with a start and catch a flicker of someone, no, *something*, sitting in it. Just for a heartbeat. A tall, shadowed silhouette. It had no eyes. I tried to lie to myself. Told myself it wasn’t real. But I knew what I saw.

Every hour I stayed awake, the apartment seemed to close in tighter. The walls flexed with breath I couldn’t hear. The scratching followed me, behind the drywall, under the floorboards, inside the vents. Sometimes, I’d feel it underfoot as I walked, as though something beneath the floor was trying to claw its way through.

I stopped sleeping. Carter said it was safer that way.

When my phone rang that afternoon, I hesitated. No one ever called me anymore. But curiosity finally broke through the fog.

*Mom.*

Her name on the screen looked strange. Out of place. Like it belonged to another life.

I answered.

For a moment, her voice was clear—too clear. And for the first time in weeks, I could breathe again.

“It’s been a while since we last talked,” she said gently. “I just wanted to check in. Make sure you weren’t getting lonely out there in the city.”

I almost laughed. “No. I’m not lonely. Carter’s here with me.”

There was a pause on the line. Then I heard it. her breath catching, trembling on the edge of words she couldn’t quite say.

“…Sweetheart,” she said, voice thin as glass,  “I can’t enable this anymore, honey. Carter isn’t there.” Her voice on the phone was trembling, but steady enough to land every word like a dagger.

“You used to talk to yourself for hours,” she continued. “Your father and I thought it was cute—for a while. Imaginary friends are normal for kids, but sweetie… you need to give this thing up. I thought your therapist would’ve helped you confront this by now.”

My breath hitched. How *dare* she say that about Carter?

“Please, hun, just take a breath,” she pleaded. “Everything will be alright, just let me—”

I hung up. And everything went still. The scratching in the walls stopped. The air froze. For a moment, I thought I had silenced the whole world. I turned around, and Carter was standing in the doorway. His eyes were darker than before. Endless.

“She’s lying, you know,” he whispered. “She wants to replace me.”

That night, I confronted him. “I don’t believe in you anymore,” I said.

He tilted his head, puzzled, like I’d said something in a language he couldn’t understand. “I’ve always been here,” he said with his voice rising. “I was there when no one else wanted you. You *made* me. You *need* me. You can’t live without me.”

I grabbed the third chair. The one that was never supposed to be there. I hauled it toward him, swinging with everything I had. If it made contact, I didn’t feel it. Carter was gone before it landed. But I kept going. I chased him, smashing the chair against the walls, the floor. The fourth chair appeared—when had I even bought these chairs ? I shattered that too. And when they finally crumbled in my hands, the house *screamed*.

Mouths opened along the walls. Dozens. Hundreds. They whispered his name. Carter. He’s in the floor now. The smashed chairs return each morning, whole again. Waiting. Watching. I hear the apartment breathing when I close my eyes. Sometimes, I think it inhales *me*.

I don’t know how long it was after the phone call with my mother. Time unraveled. Eventually, the police forced their way in. They found me naked, curled beneath the dining table, rocking back and forth, muttering to the empty chair across from me. There was no Carter. There never was. But no matter where they take me: hospital, halfway house, locked ward. When the lights go out and the room goes quiet… I hear the scrape of a chair sliding across the floor. And Carter is there.

Throwaway because this is a mess and people know my main account.

So here's the thing. My husband got deployed eight months ago. Third time in five years. Before he left, we had this huge fight because i told him he was emotionally unavailable and that i felt like i was married to a ghost even when he was home. He just shut down, packed his stuff, and left without really talking about it.

Fast forward to three months ago. I started going to this VA support group for military spouses because i was losing my mind. That's where i met him. Let's call him Dave. Dave was there because his wife had PTSD from her deployment and he was struggling too.

Dave was everything my husband wasn't. He actually listened when i talked. He asked follow up questions. He remembered things i said weeks later. When i cried about feeling abandoned, he didn't just sit there like a statue.

The group met twice a week but Dave and i started meeting for coffee after every session. Just to talk, you know? But then talking turned into longer conversations. Then longer conversations turned into him holding my hand when i cried about my marriage.

Here's where it gets complicated. Dave's a licensed therapist. Not MY therapist, but still a therapist. He kept saying we shouldn't be doing this but then he'd text me at midnight asking if i was okay. Mixed signals much?

Two months ago it happened. We were at his office after hours because i was having a breakdown about my husband extending his deployment AGAIN without even asking me first. Dave was comforting me and then we just kissed. And then we did more than kiss.

We've been sleeping together ever since. His wife doesn't know. My husband doesn't know. But Dave's been talking about leaving his wife and i've been thinking about asking for a divorce when my husband gets back next month.

But then yesterday Dave's wife showed up at the support group. Turns out she's been getting better and wanted to thank everyone for supporting her husband. She seemed so sweet and grateful. She kept talking about how much Dave helped her through her dark time and how lucky she was to have him.

I felt sick. Like physically sick. This woman has been through hell with PTSD and i've been screwing her husband behind her back while she was getting better.

When i confronted Dave about it later, he got defensive. Said his marriage was over anyway and that what we have is real. But then why hasn't he left her yet? Why does he still wear his wedding ring? Why does he still go home to her every night?

Now my husband is coming back in three weeks and i don't know what to do. Part of me thinks i should confess everything because maybe this will finally make him realize what he's been putting me through. Maybe he'll understand that i needed emotional connection and he wasn't giving it to me.

But the other part of me knows i messed up bad. Really bad. I cheated on my deployed husband with a married therapist who was supposed to be helping military families. That's like three different kinds of wrong.

My friends think i should keep my mouth shut and end things with Dave. They say my husband has been serving our country and doesn't deserve this. But they don't understand how lonely i've been. They don't know what it's like to feel like a single parent while technically being married.

Dave's wife texted me yesterday thanking me for being such a good friend to her husband during her recovery. I wanted to throw up.

So AITA for cheating on my deployed husband with a married therapist, or was i just trying to get my emotional needs met after being neglected for years?",1,1748871073.0,FoundandExpose,0,1.0,False

The Berkley Center for Reproductive Wellness in New York City provides interesting information on lifestyle choices and conceiving ability. Trying to conceive can be an emotional and sometimes unpredictable journey. While we can’t control everything, we *can* influence our fertility by making mindful choices. Some foods, drinks, drugs, and habits may be quietly working against you, and it's true for both partners. Since fertility depends on the health of both eggs and sperm, making positive lifestyle shifts is something you can tackle together.

Here’s a breakdown of what to avoid, how these things may interfere with fertility, and simple ways to start making changes.

**Foods & Drinks That Can Interfere with Fertility**

**1. Highly Processed Foods and Excess Sugar**

* **Avoid**: Fast food, sodas, candy, pastries, processed meats, and anything high in trans fats (like packaged snacks and fried foods).
* **Why**:
   * **For women**: Diets high in sugar and processed food can lead to insulin resistance, which messes with ovulation, especially for those with PCOS. Trans fats also drive inflammation, which can affect egg quality and implantation.
   * **For men**: These foods can reduce sperm count, impair movement, and lead to poor sperm shape. Excess weight gain from these foods also lowers testosterone.
* **Real-life tip**: That daily donut or fast-food run might be an easy habit, but over time, it could make it harder to conceive.

**2. Too Much Caffeine**

* **Avoid**: Over 200–300 mg daily (roughly more than 1–2 cups of coffee).
* **Why**:
   * **For women**: High caffeine levels may delay ovulation and increase the risk of miscarriage in early pregnancy.
   * **For men**: Large amounts might impact sperm quality, although the research is mixed.
* **Suggestion**: Swap that second coffee or energy drink for herbal tea or water to play it safe.

**3. Alcohol**

* **Avoid**: More than one drink daily for women, 2 for men.
* **Why**:
   * **For women**: Alcohol can interfere with hormone balance, damage eggs, and raise the risk of miscarriage.
   * **For men**: It lowers testosterone, affects sperm quality, and may cause erectile issues.
* **Simple shift**: Cutting back or stopping altogether while trying to conceive is one of the easiest ways to support reproductive health. 

**4. Excess Soy**

* **Avoid** large amounts of soy (such as daily soy milk, tofu, or soy-based supplements), especially for men.
* **Why**:
   * **For men**: Soy contains plant estrogens, which in high doses may reduce testosterone and sperm production.
   * **For women**: Some with hormone-sensitive conditions may want to limit intake.
* **Balance**: If soy is a protein staple, rotate in other options like beans, lentils, or quinoa.

**5. Fish High in Mercury**

* **Avoid**: Shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish.
* **Why**:
   * **For women**: Mercury can affect egg quality and harm a developing baby.
   * **For men**, it can damage sperm DNA and lower fertility.
* **What to eat instead**: Go for low-mercury choices like salmon, sardines, or shrimp for healthy fats without the risks.

**Recreational Drugs to Avoid**

**1. Marijuana**

* **Why it matters**:
   * **For women**: Cannabis may disrupt ovulation and affect embryo implantation.
   * **For men**: THC reduces sperm count and motility, lowers testosterone, and can change sperm shape.
* **Bottom line**: Even casual use could be affecting your fertility—best to pause while trying to conceive.

**2. Tobacco & Nicotine**

* **Includes**: Cigarettes, vaping, and chewing tobacco.
* **Why it matters**:
   * **For women**: Smoking damages eggs, shortens reproductive lifespan, and harms the uterine lining.
   * **For men**: Tobacco affects sperm count, DNA quality, and sexual function.
* **Takeaway**: Quitting can have a substantial positive impact. Avoid secondhand smoke, too.

**3. Other Street Drugs (Cocaine, Meth, etc.)**

* **Why it matters**:
   * **For women**: These drugs severely disrupt hormones, stop ovulation, and harm reproductive organs.
   * **For men**, They destroy sperm health, lower libido, and can lead to infertility.
* **Important note**: These substances are dangerous to fertility and overall health—get support if you need help quitting.

**Lifestyle Habits That Can Hurt Fertility**

**1. Unhealthy Weight**

* **Avoid**: Being significantly under or overweight (BMI below 18.5 or above 30).
* **Why**:
   * **For women**: Both extremes can shut down ovulation or make it irregular.
   * **For men**: Extra weight lowers testosterone and can cause sperm damage.
* **Tip**: Even modest weight loss (5–10% of your body weight) can help regulate hormones and improve outcomes.

**2. Overtraining**

* **Avoid**: Excessive or intense workouts (like daily long-distance running or HIIT sessions without rest).
* **Why**:
   * **For women**: Too much exercise can lower body fat too far, impacting hormone production and ovulation.
   * **For men**: Intense training might reduce testosterone, though it’s usually less impactful than in women.
* **Tip**: Stick to moderate movement—30–60 minutes of walking, yoga, or strength training most days.

**3. Chronic Stress**

* **Why**:
   * **For women**: High cortisol levels can interrupt ovulation and implantation.
   * **For men**, Ongoing stress can lower testosterone and libido.
* **Try this**: Practice deep breathing, take daily walks, or consider therapy to manage stress healthily.

**4. Toxin Exposure**

* **Avoid**: BPA in plastics, pesticides, and heavy metals like lead.
* **Why**:
   * **For women**, these can disrupt hormones and egg quality.
   * **For men**, Environmental toxins can damage sperm DNA and reduce count.
* **Simple swaps**: Use glass or stainless-steel containers and wash fruits/veggies thoroughly.

**5. Poor Sleep**

* **Avoid**: Less than 7–8 hours or an erratic sleep schedule.
* **Why**:
   * **For women**: Sleep helps regulate reproductive hormones. Poor sleep can throw off cycles.
   * **For men**, Inadequate sleep reduces testosterone and sperm health.
* **Better habits**: Wind down at the same time each night, reduce screen time before bed, and aim for a calm sleep space.
* **Why This All Matters**

Fertility is delicate, shaped by hormones, egg and sperm quality, and general well-being. Reducing or eliminating these common obstacles gives your body the best possible foundation to conceive and carry a healthy pregnancy.

**Getting Started with Small Changes**

* **Take it step-by-step**: Focus on one or two areas at a time.
* **Work together**: Fertility is a team effort. If you’re trying with a partner, make changes together.
* **Consult professionals**: A fertility doctor, acupuncturist, or nutritionist can tailor advice to your needs.
* **Track your progress**: Noticing changes in mood, cycles, or energy can help reinforce your efforts.

**Final Thoughts**

Dealing with fertility challenges isn’t easy. But by taking control of the choices that *are* in your hands, you're doing something powerful. Every positive change helps—physically, emotionally, and for your future family. Stay encouraged, stay patient, and know you don’t have to navigate this alone.

1l1hz2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1l1hz2f/is_this_idea_crazy/,Is this idea crazy,"My girlfriend(24) of 4 years just broke up with me(26) 2 days ago. It started with me texting her “things feel off” and she replied “ I don’t think I can do this anymore.” Which was a shock for me, I then tried calling but she wouldn’t answer at first but after some conversation we had a call. It was weird she was cold for about half of it but then showed a lot of emotion during it like love and missing me. Over the call was us talking almost normal (talked about our days, and made jokes and laughed) with a mix of some cold conversation. Got to a point where the call was going in circles but I just couldn’t hang up, it was like accepting it. Finally after a repeat cycle of me asking her to hang up she said “ I love you and hung up” I sent her a short text basically saying “ I love you, I’m sorry for any pain I caused you and I’ll never regret these years we had” and blocked her on everything. I just felt I needed to block her so I  don’t text her and don’t see anything related to her.

Now onto the reasons she gave me to end things

1. Long distance for the past year, and how it’s just hard, we’ve talked about closing the gap but never really solidified anything. She also mentioned she sees couples all the time and it just make her sad and upset.

2. My insecurity of me getting upset sometimes when she would go out drinking with her friends. And when I say upset I mean I’d shut down, not answer as much and make it known without saying anything. I knew I did that and she knew but we never really talk about it, until I brought it up I knew it was a problem and I wanted to address it, super hard conversation but overall it was good until it was. She visited me a month ago and one she went out with her friends I definitely wasn’t the best which isn’t fair to her because I truly do trust her but clearly me doing that shows I don’t. Been working on that.

3. The little things, I got too complacent and last time she came I didnt have flowers for her even though I know for a fact she loves that. But on the other hand she said she was happy about our last visit because I had planned a special trip with hotel booked for a night and we had a little get away she said that made her really happy. And in hindsight I just got too complacent, in the beginning of the relationship I’d get flowers, bracelets, etc and now just haven’t been as good. Which I realize with long distance I need to be twice as good try twice as hard. 

Overall after she told me everything it just felt unfinished, she never said the words “ I’m breaking up with you” but clearly that was happening. In person we rarely had many problems (that could be do to her communication skills also, I’d have to pry stuff out when she was upset) but since long distance it’s been so much. One thing I think that added to it is whenever we talked about living together we talk about here in the US and she was hesitant but seemed interested, I’ve always been one to be down to go to Europe but I never really said that. Plus I’m a dual citizen so it would be easier for me at the moment to go and move there. I just wish I had said those things to her not during the break up call but way before when we had those conversations.

I’m now planning a trip to Europe to see her but not as a complete surprise. My plan is to stay with my friends that live near, I’ve been to Europe many times and have friends all over so it wouldn’t be much of an issue. My goal is to send her a text while on flight saying something like this “I’m going to be in Europe for the next few days, I would love to see you and talk. Can we meet for coffee?“ (I’d be within a 30 min train ride from her) I don’t want to surprise her like in person I want her to have the option to just say no and walk away. Because no would be enough closure for me. But overall I have plans and could stay busy if she says no.

I know this is all crazy but I just couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t go and try to see her. I’d rather go and her say no I’m good then just ponder what could of been.

I think my mind is pretty made up but I would love some insight or opinions from people who may have been in similar situations or not. Sorry if this story is all over the place didn’t know how to order it or what else to add.",2,1748870724.0,LongDistance,0,1.0,False

i will try to be as clear and concise as possible. I am in Canada and wanted to get some insight on what I should do in this situation. 

My wife and I were planning our destination wedding beginning last year, in March. We reached out to a travel agent and decided on a resort in Cancun. We paid our desport on March 19, 2024 to lock in the group rate and sent the invite to our family members. 

The final balance was due on February 7, 2025 and was paid in full. 

The flights were initially from Saturday, May 3, 2025 and return May 10, 2025. The airline was Sunwing. Our Travel Agent informed us on February 20, 2025 that Sunwing was unable to honor those flights and changed the departure and return dates: depart May 2, 2025 and return May 9, 2025. Our travel agent informed the group of this change and we all agreed. The agent mentioned this change was probably due to the merger that was taking place between Sunwing and WestJet

My wife and I decided to extend our stay and asked the Travel Agent if she can change our return flight to a later date. She changed only our return ticket to May 15, 2025. Our return flight was to depart at 5 pm and return home to Edmonton at 10:15 pm. 

On May 14, 2025, I was trying to check in to our flight via the Sunwing app but it was not working. I tried multiple times with our reservation code but it did not work. I tried on the Sunwing website as well and same thing. I chalked this up to and error on Sunwing end. We decided upon check out of the AirBnB we will head straight to the airport, get this sorted out and then relax until the flight.

On May 15, we woke up, did our final packing etc and were enjoying our coffee as check out was at 1:30 pm and it takes about half hour to get to the airport from our BnB. I was trying to log into the Sunwing app on my phone to view the itinerary but it wasnt working again. I tried on my wifes phone to log in and pull up our itinerary and after a few tries it worked. Thats when I noticed there was a flight change. Our original flight was WG5408 to depart at 5 pm; however, on the app, it showed the departure time was 2:30 pm and was changed to a WestJet flight. Panic ensued and we tried our best to get to the airport but it didnt happen and we ultimately had to miss our flight. 

I called Sunwing to inquire about this but they were unable to assist me as the booking was under the Travel Agent. I contacted the agent to inform her of the issue. She said she did not receive any email notifications for the flight change like before. I told her I looked through our emails/spam/junk in all of our emails and also didnt see any change communicated. The agent said she will reach out to Sunwing and see what the next steps should be. The agent called me an hour later and said Sunwing communicated the change to all of the guests. I told her again we did not receive anything. The agent said Sunwing is unable to rebook us on a different flight and we should now buy our own ticket back. The agent said she can then submit the request to Sunwing for reimbursement. We ended up purchasing a flight back to Edmonton from WestJet as they were the cheapest at around $1800 from Cancun to Edmonton. We sent the receipts to our agent who then submitted it to Sunwing for review. 

I received an email from my agent on May 30, 2025 from my agent. She informed me Sunwing will not issue a reimbursement. They said the change was communicated on April 3, 2025 and sent to my wifes email. They showed the Sunwing online portal was accessed by my wifes email on April 10, 2025. They said since you logged in to the app or website, you must have viewed the documents and therefore, the request is denied. I tried to contact my credit card for compensation and they also said in this case, there is nothing they can do. They said first I should have called them to file a claim but the fact that I missed my flight entirely makes me ineligible for assistance. The agent said even though you did not receive notification, there were other passengers and a whole new plane that needed to be sourced. 

I reviewed the Canadian Transport Agency website regarding communcations with passengers and it does state it has to be communicated within a certain time, in a clear manner and in a format that is easily accessible. 

So now, my family and friends are saying to take this up with a lawyer. They said its unacceptable that this happened and there has to be a way to prove we did not know about the change. I thought about it but I'm also thinking is it really worth it over $1800 bucks? So now I'm coming to Reddit for assistance and expertise. Is there grounds here for me to reach out to a lawyer that specializes in passenger rights?

Hey everyone. I’ve tried this before and it seems to die out every time. But persistence is key right? If you’ve messaged me before and our conversation faded out - feel free to hit me up again. 

Like many of you, I am a married, dad looking for connection with other guys - something I have lost as I have gotten older. I was told early in my career the way to succeed was to be willing to move to accept promotions. Well, it was fun while it lasted but in the end I ended up getting fired from that job and moved away from essentially every friend I ever had. I still have a few guys I keep in touch with on occasion but it’s just not the same anymore. 

I have plenty of acquaintances. People I see regularly but have limited interaction with. I’d consider some of my coworkers casual friends, but because they are co-workers there is a natural professionalism barrier I think at times that prevents us from getting too close. What I’m aiming for is someone who would develop into a close friend. A friend to share personal thoughts, feelings, and experiences with. Ideally someone in real life, but I’d take a good online friend too. This stage often takes several months to a couple of years to develop. It’s also extra difficult for us as married dads. The spare time we have is laughable. But I am the type of person who is willing to make time for important stuff.

A little about my interests: I am drawn to outdoor type activities like hiking, backpacking, rock climbing, kayaking, etc. I workout regularly; although not super serious about it. I enjoy running and swimming. The nerdry side of me likes web development. Not a video gamer though. However, I do enjoy word games and puzzles. I like doing handyman type projects around the house until they take too long and it starts to feel like work. I operate on black coffee. While I don’t judge at all - I am just not drawn naturally to people who use drugs, vape, etc. Lean democrat/liberal but really probably more of a moderate. 

If any of this resonates with you, I’d love to connect! FYI - if I get more than one or two adds, I may hold off on adding you back until I can focus on chatting with you. #FL",1,1748870648.0,NextBestBro,0,1.0,False

Neither of us have a car or many local friends. We go places together but my gf works from home most of the time and otherwise just doesn't leave very often and so we're always on top of each other and I'm almost never alone at home and I'm quietly going fucking insane.

I work full time in person in a front-facing job and am gone usually 11-12 hours a day with the commute. Obviously I can leave on my time off but it doesn't fully work as alone time when I'm like at the park or in a coffee shop or whatever. Lately the days my gf is supposed to work in person she just decides not to for various reasons. She's been depressed, which means sometimes she'll straight up move between the couch and the bed for an entire weekend (she's on meds and in therapy and all but she's just still like that idk).

I think I'm also missing just having extended time where no expects anything from me. If I leave the house my gf will want to know where I am and when I'm coming back - and that's reasonable ofc but it feels so stifling rn. The times I've gone out of town she wants to call me like 3 times a day. She sometimes gets bummed if I leave the house to go read on my own or go to the gym. She doesn't get it when I say I need space, it makes her think I'm pulling away and it all gets worse.

So I had my gallbladder removed in 2020. Went into the ER with what I thought was gas pains, turns out my gallbladder was so full of stones I had it removed the next morning. 

I honestly don’t remember much about my BMs before the surgery, but since then it seems 90% of my stools are mush. Very soft and not formed. I also typically have a lot of urgency after eating and it seems there are a TON of foods that don’t agree with me (greasy/fatty foods, anything spicy, cream based foods, coffee, even LETTUCE). Those foods change my BM to URGENT diarrhea, often a bile like yellow color. I don’t have any pain, never had a problem with constipation, and I’ve never seen blood in my stool, seen a little on the paper once or twice during a diarrhea flare up but I chalked that up to a fissure due to the diarrhea.

I have pretty debilitating health anxiety so I always think worst case scenario. I initially had a GI appointment for July and I have been PANICKING because of the wait. I had a gut feeling to call this morning and they ended up having a last minute cancellation and can see me TOMORROW! Very excited as I’ve never had my gut professionally diagnosed, but also very nervous. 

Any support or similar stories would be very much appreciated 🫶🏼

I was sitting just next to them so I could hear every single word, even if I did not want to.

The Russian was telling Thai how how Russians can’t transfer money from Russia because of sanctions, so everyone is doing crypto now. And he said that Russians had their bank accounts closed so they can not receive money anymore from crypto exchanges. He was explaining the Thai guy his business plan, consisting of that Thai person registering on bitkub, receiving USDT from Russians, withdrawing into his bank account and then somehow giving Russians the money. In return he keeps commission. He was also promised an affiliate programme where he can invite people and get some percentage from their transactions. The Russian did not just say hundred dollars there, few hundred there. He was talking about moving up to one million baht per month. Because Russians want to move money to Thailand to buy villas and businesses in Phuket. Of course the Russian kept saying, quoting, “everything is verifiable, you can’t see it, but it’s verifiable, trust me” and “everything is legal and transparent”. Mentioning at the same time that they don’t have any exchange licences, even incorporated company, nothing. Just some shady money movement. And he said he will send the details over, but please please do not share with anyone. So legal and transparent.

The poor Thai guy was sitting there without a clue that he is being recruited as a money mule. Receiving millions from people he does not know into his personal bank account. He just seemed happy to have an opportunity to make some money on the side.

I know the way it works in Thailand generally is don’t get involved, usually no one is going to say thank you, only blame you for everything. But still, once the Russian left, I really wanted to warn the Thai, but while I was forming the sentence in my mind, he left too.

And now I’m sitting here and thinking, what a hell did I just witness, so open and in public

After using the[ SMEG 50’s Retro Style Electric Kettle](https://hobbiespoint.com/honest-review-smeg-50s-retro-style-electric-water-kettle-klf03blus/) (KLF03BLUS) for several weeks, it’s clear that this appliance blends aesthetics with solid performance. While the vintage-inspired design is the first thing that stands out, the build quality and consistent usability make it a practical kitchen companion.

The kettle is equipped with a 1500W heating element that brings water to a boil relatively quickly, making it ideal for tea, coffee, and instant meals. Its 1.7-liter capacity is sufficient for daily household use, and the automatic shut-off feature adds an extra layer of safety. The 360° swivel base and anti-slip feet also contribute to easy handling.

Over time, the stainless steel interior has shown good resistance to limescale buildup, especially when used with filtered water. Though it lacks advanced features like temperature control, the SMEG kettle consistently performs as expected, with minimal noise and a solid, ergonomic grip.

Overall, it’s a reliable, well-built product that offers both form and function—especially for users who appreciate stylish appliances that work as well as they look.",1,1748870218.0,RoboticPool,0,1.0,False

In a small, oppressed town, the morning ritual at Grind & Brew café was its citizens’ only semblance of normalcy. Greg Mercer had worked as the head barista there for seven years, finding quiet pride in serving perfect lattes and espressos to townsfolk desperate for comfort under the watchful eyes of the regime.

It began subtly—fleeting images appearing in the swirls of coffee grounds left in cups. At first, Greg dismissed them as tricks of an overworked mind. But when the visions started coming true—a surprise inspection at the factory, a neighbor’s arrest, a rare supply truck arrival—he could no longer deny his emerging gift.

The gift was specific: he could only glimpse fragments of what was to come in the residual patterns of coffee grounds. Sometimes clear as photographs, other times symbolic and requiring interpretation. And with each vision, a physical toll: migraines that intensified with the significance of what he foresaw.

Greg kept his ability secret, knowing full well the regime’s strict laws against “superstitious practices”—their term for anything they couldn’t control or explain. The punishment for divination was particularly severe—public execution intended to make examples of those who claimed access to knowledge the regime couldn’t monopolize.

Yet as his visions grew stronger, Greg found himself in an impossible position. Sometimes he saw things that could save lives: impending arrests, planned food shortages, rare opportunities for escape. Could he morally keep such information to himself? But sharing it meant risking everything.

What began as whispered warnings to trusted customers evolved into a dangerous underground network. People who needed guidance would leave specific cups marked with innocuous symbols, and Greg would find ways to communicate what he saw without explicit acknowledgment of his gift.

As his reputation grew in hushed circles, so did the attention from the regime’s enforcers, who couldn’t understand how certain citizens always seemed one step ahead of their plans. And inevitably, as Greg’s visions had foretold in dark swirls of arabica, the net began closing around him.

Now he faces the ultimate dilemma: use his gift to orchestrate his escape, or stay to help others while knowing the grounds have already shown him the price he may pay.",1,1748870130.0,theEichlerChronicles,0,1.0,False

1l1hlnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1l1hlnz/weird_ending_to_a_good_story/,Weird ending to a good story,"I M(32) started dating this girl (F29), somewhere in November last year. We spent a lot of time together and we seemed to vibe emotionally, but also in most other aspects we expect from life. 
However, I’ve always seemed to be a bit to quick with the next steps. Whether it was the first kiss, first time sleeping at my place or showing affection in public, - I always got denied first, before she shortly after took the initiative. So I thought, it’s better to take things slow. 

Fast forward to April. I thought we are on a really mature way to a solid relationship when she dumped me and said she has the feeling we should be on another level already. I told her honestly how much I fought with myself in holding back feelings and taking the slow approach, but all she said was that these are nice words, but she can’t handle the „if“ and „could’ve“. I should not wait for her to change her mind, since I know she’s stubborn and will stick to her decision. 
This got me broken and I tried to let go, which didn’t really work. I went on dates and stuff, but every minor inconvenience with new people remind me on what we had. So I wrote her a letter. Not to plead, not to beg, but to tell her I what I learned about myself and the lesson I took from the past 6 months. And that I’d like her not to disappear, but see whether something new could be something better. She contacted me and said she’s touched by the letter and has to tidy up her own mess.

Two weeks later, she invited me for coffee at her place. We had a nice conversation, but didn’t get to any emotional stuff, since I didn’t want her to feel uncomfortable. But she said she‘d like to meet again, but is super busy at the moment with work, studies and all other stuff. 

After some days I did the mistake to ask her again how she thinks about another meeting. I said I couldn’t fully understand what kind of situation this is right now. She went really angry and told me nothing has changed since the „breakup“. It’s the same situation and she thought I would like to meet as friends (like seriously, is this realistic??). I should not wait for her. She said she’s extremely busy and in fact I know that she is. But she also said every massage from me only results in stress because she feels that I am waiting for something to MAYBE change and I shouldn’t do it. 

Now I’m devastated again. I mean, I’m quite sure that she’s not with someone else, but rather cooling down now from an emotional rollercoaster. She told me her current two weeks are super full with work, weddings and studies and I am causing stress, when I don’t give her time. 
She said another „situationship“ doesn’t make sense and of course I said I am not interested in that either, but in a serious relationship, and not in a friendship. If she’d like that, she could get in touch with me, when it’s calmer on her side again. She said ok. 

Perhaps this story is super clear and I should move on, but I’m still clinging to every word she said. I’m clinging to the „maybe something changes“ and the „I would get in touch with you, but you’re always faster“. 
Is there a reason to believe this could work? It’s her birthday in four weeks. Maybe a good occasion just to get back on her radar, but I feel she’s forgetting me very fast.

1l1hjcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/1l1hjcn/considering_dietetics_and_working_in_a_hospital/,"Considering dietetics and working in a hospital, but is it as toxic as nursing?","Currently in university. I realize not all dietetics work in hospitals, but I was wondering for those who do, is it as toxic as nursing? I recently came across of a tiktok of someone who was complaining about a new nurse suing a hospital because not long after being hired, they were immediately bullied and harassed by other nurses, and someone went into their backpack and poured coffee into it. The new nurse seemed to be under the impression that the harassment was racially motivated. The person on the tik tok however was saying it was their fault and if they ""can't handle the profession they shouldn't be there."" To me, that says it all. I can't imagine working in those conditions, it just seems so unnecessarily dramatic, petty and unprofessional. Is it the same for dietetics? I have autistic tendencies, although I'm very high functioning and most people do not notice it unless they've known me a while, but I have been a target of bullying before, (way back in middle school early high school not so much anymore) but this kind of thing still bothers me. I've thought about going into eating disorder dietetics and working with disordered patients (I can take a patient hating me or cussing me out over food) but the idea of ending up in a situation where I'm working with people without mutual professional respect concerns me.",1,1748869563.0,dietetics,9,0.67,False
1l1hjam,https://steamcommunity.com/games/362490/announcements/detail/515211349279640011,Coffee Diary - June 2025,"> Hey Exanimates,  
>
> Insider testing has been ongoing for most of the month, which went surprisingly smooth for a first round of testing after so much development down time. We've patched the test build a few times now, but many of the issues being reported were older things we've been catching up on and we've spent most of the time making improvements rather than bug fixing.  
>   
> We've only added a few fundamental roles and a little dialogue so far to test the core functionality, we did run into some tricky issues, but everything seems to be running smooth now. We should be able to focus on adding more role based behaviours and dialogue now that the foundation is solid. We've been getting a lot of useful feedback and suggestions from testers, and had some in-depth discussions. We're still figuring out what the right balance is for NPCs being talkative and reactive and we'll be experimenting with things over time.  
>   
> Core AI received a lot of fundamental changes in terms of emotions, personality etc. with the goals of making personality more important, providing some more rational behaviour even without role involvement and supporting better interaction with roles. For now we've mostly been trying to get things balanced out and working again, though during testing we did expand quite a lot on some core behaviours and reactivity and how these work together with various activities. NPCs must now juggle many things, like for example following someone, searching the environment, looting, noticing interesting things, keeping an eye on potential threats and conducting a dialogue all at the same time. Tricky stuff, and no doubt we'll keep tweaking and improving core AI and these sort of things, but we seem to have everything in a pretty good functional spot already.  
>   
> Looting behaviour was another big focus in testing. Derrin as our test case for these new features, now moves around the environment independently searching objects, containers and bodies, calling out items he thinks the player might find useful and looting and equipping himself independently. There's a lot of nuance to choosing which items are worth taking or holding on to as well as coordinating this more independent behaviour. We've made some pretty big improvements and adjustments during testing, mostly trying to make this as smooth and practical as possible. Making AI as capable of interacting with the world as a player is a big part of our vision, but we do also see this as an important gameplay and quality of life feature. We'll definitely keep expanding on and tweaking this, but it's quite functional already. Testers have noted that seeing Derrin move around and engage and interact with the environment instead of just standing there is very impactful and really brings him to life.  
>   
> A while back we developed a new pathfinding system for dealing with dynamic paths involving physics objects, multiple layers, vertical clearance and potentially more modes of movement, and we've now made some more improvements. The system is complex and has not been free of some issues since we introduced it. During testing we particularly found it's not great to have smart and talkative NPCs if they then just walk into a pit while carrying all your loot, or get stuck in silly ways. We did a deep dive into the pathfinding system, to make AI take less unnecessary risks, not get stuck and a few other solid improvements. We've identified a few more things we can improve, but already things are in a much better state. Exanima is a complex game at a very fundamental level, and this has obvious advantages, but we're well aware that it can also lead to some tedium and annoyance. Now that we've developed our core tech to this extent, we see ourselves focusing more on making a smoother and more enjoyable experience and quality of life in general.  
>   
> This update also includes a significant overhaul of our apparel system to solve many issues with clipping and animation and massively streamline our workflow, as well as some performance and other benefits. Just about every item in the game had to be reconfigured for it and often adjusted in some way if not completely reworked. Inevitably there were some things to fix up and here there, but we're all caught on any clipping and similar issues reported so far. Things are looking very good on this front.  
>   
> There were some notable graphical improvements in this update too, with some new tech for ground displacement, detail shadows, lighting and shadows in general and many asset improvements too. We've had testers often express how impressed they've been with the graphical updates and how good the game looks now. We're always aware of things we can do to make the game look even better, but we try to avoid working on graphics tech as there's so much else to do and we want to keep the game potato friendly. These were relatively low investments and scalable upgrades with a big return and we're very glad we did them.  
>   
> Finally, as we're very close to public testing we'd like to briefly introduce the role system, what it's supposed to do and what to expect from it, as there are clearly still many misconceptions. This is also important to clarify what we hope to gain from testing and what kind of feedback we'd like to see.  
>   
> What the role system is not, is a specific set of AI features and capabilities. This is a very important distinction from other AI systems you may be comparing it to. Such a ""one and done"" system would not be enough to do what we want from it. We're all about delivering that quality hand crafted experience. We do not want dynamic, but ultimately shallow NPCs. The role system is essentially a content tool, a narrative tool. Roles are very broad in their scope, they can provide unique behaviours and dialogue for specific characters, or they can, as the term ""role"" suggests, be adopted by any character. Characters can have many roles at once and know each other by various roles, these roles change dynamically. Every role provides new interactions, and these can lead to more roles with more interactions and so on. This means that as we build our library of roles, we create more and more emergent behaviours. So in a sense, it is a collection of AI capabilities, one that we can keep expanding on, but above all else it is a dynamic story telling tool.  
>   
> This means that just because we added the system, you won't suddenly see the undead taking up new professions and starting book clubs. While that is entirely within the realm of the system, our aim for now is to very carefully craft what we would call ""foundational roles"". These would be the roles describing the most common behaviours, activities and relationships, that other roles can then build on, specialise on, or add to. Our first goal is to make NPC companions that feel as close as possible to human players. This is particularly difficult, it involves some intricate roles and mechanics. We want to gather feedback and ideas and learn everything we can from this particularly complex and important case before designing many more roles.  
>   
> You should hopefully get an idea of the direction of this with your first experiences of it, but basically keep in mind that our intent for now is to build on these fundamental aspects and make them really good, not to add a bunch of fluff and drown out the essence of it with noise. Ideally your feedback would reflect this, and you will be critical of the foundations before asking about the colour of the wallpaper. Tell us how you wish the AI had reacted during moments of gameplay, without focusing too much on the specifics. Also bear in mind that part of our vision is non player centric design. A player will inevitably do things an NPC will not, but they are just another character with their own set of roles. The AI is incapable of distinguishing between player and non player characters, so think of roles and interactions as always interchangeable.  
>   
> Since testing began we've mostly been working on things and making some additions that we didn't really expect to, but now we're back on track. We're working on introducing one last role based interaction and reviewing some dialogue now so we expect public testing to begin soon. A big thank you to the testers who have been very thorough and patient and have been giving us great feedback.

Hey everyone! F22 from the USA here. 

Honestly I don’t even know where to begin, but here I go. I’ve been friends with this one girl, we can call her Cas. We met back in high school through my sister. I was a senior and she was a freshmen at the time. She was really good friends with my sister and because of that, I found myself helping her out with various things. From navigating high school to even applying for her first job(she was a sophomore when this happened). At the time I didn’t have an exact friendship with her. I just kind of helped her and went on about my day. Well, she ended up getting the job and ultimately became a coworker as well. Still, here we aren’t friends or such. Just my sister’s friend who I would help occasionally.

As time goes on, we begin to chat and have nice meaningful conversations. Our conversations would be so long and amazing that when I would give her rides, we’d stay parked in her drive way for up to a couple of hours or more. Until either her mother called her(she would check up on her as she would be away at work.) or one of us caught a glance of the time. I loved chatting with her as I felt like finally someone was interested in what I had to say and genuinely enjoy it. On top of that, she would add a lot more to the conversation and I felt relaxed rather than tense or awkward. It remained like this for a couple of years. 

So, in the summer of 2023 I quit my job and from there I didn’t really hear much from her. Occasionally she would send a message or 2 with a question in regard to college. So, for about 10 months I kind of lost some contact with her. It wasn’t until May of 2024 that I ran into her at a Barnes and noble. We caught up and talked about our lives and how it had been a while since we last spoke or saw one another. She asked me about where I was working and if I considered returning to my old job. I actually was unsatisfied with the hours at my place of employment at the time and was considering returning to my old job. I kind of felt embarrassed as I know she looked up to me and for her to hear my frustration and regret on leaving, it was just not so fun. 

After that conversation we said our goodbyes and later that night, I came to the conclusion that it was best to return to my old job. You could say that she had heavy influence on my decision. So, two months later I returned and began working with her more frequently. We would joke and goof off together and even talk about life and college and such. It was fun and even here I didn’t feel anything of that sort towards her. 

Well, the semester begins and things were going well. Unfortunately in November I had a very difficult time as I was in talks of marriage to a guy I had been talking to for 9 months. I know, so soon? Well, we both came from a background where people move fast for marriage. Anyways, I was really down and she was the only one that noticed. One day at work I was fighting back tears and she immediately came and consoled me. I was so taken back. Nobody, not even my own family had checked on me in this manner. Well, I broke down in front of her. I felt ashamed but the pain was far more than my pride. She talked to me and gave me a hug. I remember how she pulled me into an embrace and my tears just came running down like crazy. 

After that moment I did feel better, but I was just taken back as to how she actually cared and heard me out. Well, as the weeks passed she would check up on me, bring me coffee and would never let me leave without her giving me a hug and giving me words of encouragement. As I began to slowly move on from my breakup, I began to find a true friends in her. The issue is that she’s very very friendly and affectionate. I on the other hand am rather reserved and very careful on who I open up to. At this time I had also moved out of my parents home and with 2 other roommates, whom were also coworkers. So, as our friendship formed, i began to get very comfortable around her and very close to her. We would joke together and anything we were instructed to do, no matter how big or small the task, we would do together. My roommates began picking up on our friendship and even kind of took offense on how I was very different around Cas, as to compared to them. 

Well, we slowly began to do harmless little flitting. You know, things very close friends do. Hype one another up, shower one another in compliments and of course, make fun of one another and have our inside jokes. She would begin to hold my hand and initially I did find it weird but slowly I began getting used to her way of being. I would just brush it off as her being her. 

As weeks passed, we began to spill our stories and share secrets between one another. Here’s where I caught myself falling for her. She would do this thing where her hands would massage my shoulders and I couldn’t help but tremble at her touch. I wouldn’t even flinch or step back when she would get close to me. I’d just stand there and allow her to do so. I thought perhaps I was finally getting comfortable with physical affection, but nope. It only would happen with her that I’d remain calm and even happy that she got so close to me. I got to know her as a person and really connect with her. 

We even had a galentines with other coworker friends and during one of the games, I did catch her looking my way, but I brushed it off. That night I hugged her goodbye and she ever sos lightly kissed my cheek. That’s when again, things really began to shake up for me. I’m a straight female. I’ve been into guys all my life. I’ve only ever been in one serious relationship, but I never once had been attracted to a female or even curious to find out. Even if I were to, it would never be allowed as my family would never accept it and would probably throw me out forever. 

I’ve been trying to ignore these feelings and brush them off. Unfortunately, yesterday after work, it hit me hard. She had been gone for a few weeks and work felt somewhat miserable without her. And when I heard she was back, I was so so happy and joyful. We talked and began our little flirtatious acts. After work we chatted a bit in the parking lot and hugged before leaving. In the car it hit me. I’m falling for this girl and I don’t know what to do or how to handle it. It’s impossible and to dare continue with this, would end in disaster and pain. What do I do? What should I say? Or is it best I leave her and get as far away as possible? Or am I just being silly? 

Btw, she’s 20 now and I’m about to be 23(October). I never once felt anything nor did I approach her in any manner when she was 18 or under. If anything this developed when she was 19. I also feel off as I don’t want anyone thinking wrongly. I’ve just seen too many cases where it’s happened.

He has been so mean to his little 2.5 year old brother lately. Nothing I do seems to be making an impact. They fight and argue all day long, constantly bicker, almost every peaceful play session ends in tears. I know siblings will be siblings, but I can’t help but feel like there’s an exceptionally high level of bullying going on. 

Here’s a scenario from this morning. 

Big brother (L) gets up on the coffee table. He invites little brother (A) to come up with him. A gets up on the table too, and L is immediately irritated because he doesn’t want A in his space and wants him to get down. L starts flailing his legs hitting A with his knees, I intervene and explain to L that he invited A up and now he can’t change his mind so he needs to make room for A. L keeps kicking A so I remove him from the table. A gets down and goes over to see my youngest son, 7 months old, in his walker. L is still mad so he goes up and grabs the walker and starts shaking it back and forth. Of course I immediately stop him from doing this and I ask him to go to his room and tell him I’ll be there in a moment to speak with him. On his walk to his room, he walks by A and hits him directly in the face. 

Here’s what I try to do to make things better 

Redirection. He’s very headstrong though and knows what he wants to do. This doesn’t often work. 

Time outs. Usually 3-5 minutes depending on what he did. I let him calm down in his room and then we have a conversation after about why what he did was wrong. 

No TV. We noticed a difference in attitude after taking away movies and TV shows. They don’t have tablets, either. So no screens at all. 

Lots of outside time. All of my boys seem to be very high energy and are so happy outside. We have a decent backyard with lots of things for them to do and live by great parks and playgrounds. However, with a 7 month old, it’s not always easy getting out by myself with all 3. ",1,1748868930.0,toddlers,3,1.0,False

How do you time this to work for when the days are split up? Typically I’ve noticed it takes about 90 minutes to 2 hours to kick in. Then I get about 5 core hours of concentration and alertness. And then it pretty much wears off. 

If I take at 9am, it’s great and I’m very present and focused with my kiddos which is honestly why I decided to make this change and take this medicine. But I also need to be alert and ready at night. I typically work from 8-10:30/11. 

I am a night person so if I work to my natural cycle usually I get a nighttime kick especially if I drink a coffee around 6:30. But I don’t want to take the medicine at 4 or 5 and be up til 3. I still have to get up with my kids.

So anyone have this kinda situation and how they managed it? ",2,1748868730.0,VyvanseADHD,7,1.0,False

We had great conversations over text, easy flow, some laughs, similar interests. We eventually decided to meet for a casual coffee date this weekend. I genuinely enjoyed talking to him in person too. There weren’t any major red flags, but I wasn’t completely sure about the chemistry yet. I usually prefer a second date to know for sure. Same with this one.

Here’s where I got stuck:

The date lasted around 90 minutes. Toward the end, it got a little awkward. Not in a bad way, just kind of quiet. We were sitting there, smiling at each other. It felt like neither of us knew how to wrap it up. He eventually ordered an Uber and left around 6 p.m. We exchanged a quick, slightly awkward side hug.

Once I got home (within an hour), I texted him this:

“Hey, thanks again for making the trip out today. It was nice meeting you in person. Hope your ride back was smooth!”

I sent it because I appreciated him coming out. It was a quick trip for me, but a bit longer for him (about 30 minutes one way). I just wanted to be polite and express that I had a decent time.

It’s been over 24 hours, and there’s been no reply. I wasn’t expecting a whole conversation or immediate plans for a second date, but I was hoping for at least an acknowledgement or something. Now I can’t help but spiral. 

Was it the timing of the message? Was I too eager? Did I give off a weird vibe in person? Did he not feel it and just didn’t want to say anything?

I’m not planning to follow up, and I’m not devastated. Just feeling a bit rejected and wondering if I unintentionally did something off. Would love to hear your thoughts, even if it’s a tough pill.",7,1748868696.0,Bumble,11,1.0,False

💡 *History shows us that the real winners make money by doing the opposite of what feels safe or popular.*  
💡 *You can’t become a millionaire by doing what 95% are doing.*

Let’s break this down with some behavioral finance concepts and how it ties into a real-world opportunity: Kendu.

**1. Prospect Theory: The Fear of Losing**

Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman taught us about *loss aversion* — how we fear losses more than we value gains.

This often leads to:

* Selling too early just to “lock in” profits (think 2x or 3x exits when coins go on to do 30x+)
* Avoiding early-stage plays because they feel “too risky” or “too new”

Ironically, this is *exactly* where the asymmetric opportunities lie and winners takes these opportunities.

**2. Herd Mentality & FOMO**

Buffett said it best:

*“Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.”*

Yet most people still follow hype, trends, and influencers — jumping in late and exiting too soon.

**3. Concentration Beats Diversification (Sometimes)**

You've probably heard:

*“Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.”*

But the real winners? They *do the opposite*. They go deep when they have conviction. Because a 50x return on a tiny position barely moves the needle. You need bold conviction + real skin in the game to make it big

**🚀 Why Kendu Could Be Your Edge**

Kendu is not just another meme coin (actually a **BRAND COIN** now). It’s a **contrarian, early-stage, community-first brand**.

Here’s what makes it stand out:

* **⚡️ It’s early** — The best time to invest is *before* the hype cycle.
* **🌍 Real-world brand building** — Kendu is launching products like Kendu Coffee, Kendu Energy, Kendu Games, AI Vending machine, kendu organics, Merch etc.
* **🎉 Real-life experiences** — Think Kendu Nights, Pickleball events, Murals, and Music Festivals.
* **🧠 Leveraging CAAS** — *Community as a Service*. This isn’t a digital-only hype — it’s a living, breathing ecosystem.
* **📈 Asymmetric potential** — High conviction, early entry, and outsized upside.

*""If everyone already sees it, it’s too late.""*

**TL;DR:**

Most people follow the crowd. Winners don’t.

If you believe in community, brand, and being early — Kendu might just be your asymmetric bet.

  
Remember the two hard truths posted at the start. Be bold, embrace risk and play this cycle differently for once!

**If you're just discovering Kendu, you're early.**  
**If you've been here, you already know.**  
**And if you think memecoins can't build anything real—Kendu will prove you wrong.**

1l1h2g1,https://i.redd.it/mlyaco1wbi4f1.jpeg,SOTD - Now we're talking (Styletto V2 Stainless Steel update),"Did we need a razor like this? In my opinion, yes we did, and now we finally have it. This is probably the most efficient yet delicate closed comb I own and seeing such a masterpiece completely being designed and made in Italy is a huge deal, especially at such a ""low"" price point considering the quality of the material being used.  
  
On the first pass WTG little to no blade feel. 3 days of growth went down the drain with incredible ease, leaving a more than satisfying result for non-BBS seekers. No clogging issues whatsoever.  
  
Second pass ATG, now the blade was more perceivable, but never too much. Always keep in mind that this razor gives the blade a quite pronounced bend, so a more open angle makes things butter smooth, unlike razors such as the Razorock Lupo (aluminium), which I struggle to shave smoothly with due to the little blade bend.  
  
In the end, very few passes, extreme efficiency and full out BBS, just the way I like it. This razor weighs a ton for its size, and you can feel every gram in the cutting efficacy. That's one big reason I never got the aluminium counterpart. 10/10, would definitely recommend if you like heavy efficient razors and close shaves, though keep in mind I would not consider this to be a daily razor unless you go WTG exclusively.

In a motion filed on May 30, 2025, Middleton and his companies, Veritaseum, Inc., and Veritaseum, LLC, allege that the SEC fabricated evidence and intimidated witnesses to obtain an asset freeze that ultimately coerced him into a settlement, in which he neither admitted or denied the allegations against him. ""The Securities and Exchange Commission fabricated evidence that Reggie Middleton stole investor assets in order to obtain an asset freeze,"" the motion boldly declares ([DOC\_119\_MEM\_SPRT.pdf,](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/Qma7PZLhAR1mV5MsPudvjDYm5Za1rJGkhjFuxyQ4eeMKMW) p. 3), echoing a troubling precedent set in the SEC vs Debtbox case where the SEC faced sanctions for similar misconduct.Motion to Vacate - Document 118

# The Genesis of the Dispute

The saga began in August 2017 when the SEC launched an investigation into Middleton and his companies, suspecting them of raising $14.8 million through an unregistered initial coin offering (ICO) and subsequent sales of VERI tokens between April 2017 and February 2018. The SEC alleged violations including unregistered securities sales under Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, fraudulent misrepresentations under Section 17(a) and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and price manipulation under Section 9(a)(2). Middleton, however, steadfastly maintains that VERI tokens were utility tokens—tools for accessing the VeADIR platform—not securities, a distinction central to his defense ([DOC\_119\_MEM\_SPRT.pdf](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/Qma7PZLhAR1mV5MsPudvjDYm5Za1rJGkhjFuxyQ4eeMKMW), p. 9-11).The investigation began with a phone call from SEC attorney Jorge Tenreiro to Middleton’s counsel, Franklin Jason Seibert, threatening subpoenas if cooperation wasn’t forthcoming ([DOC\_120\_SEIB\_DECL.pdf](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmXzbMwxC7NErAunjSYn5PTF1P9k6fpL4HdMCU4Jd9Gwj8), p. 2). Seibert, keen to collaborate, requested clarity on whether a formal order of investigation existed, but Tenreiro remained evasive and stated that he needed to see “magic language” in order to provide it. ([DOC\_120\_SEIB\_DECL.pdf](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmXzbMwxC7NErAunjSYn5PTF1P9k6fpL4HdMCU4Jd9Gwj8), p. 3). Further, the SEC acknowledged that there in fact was an unpublished modification to the Enforcement Manual that impacted Defendants Due Process rights, but the SEC and Mr. Tenreiro refused to provide those updates ([DOC\_119\_MEM\_SPRT.pdf](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/Qma7PZLhAR1mV5MsPudvjDYm5Za1rJGkhjFuxyQ4eeMKMW), p. 8). This set the tone for what Middleton now describes as a ""calculated scheme"" to undermine his business.

# The Alleged Fraud: A Misrepresented Kraken Account

At the heart of Middleton’s allegations is a claim that the SEC misrepresented the ownership of a Kraken exchange account to secure a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and asset freeze in August 2019. During the TRO hearing, Tenreiro asserted that Middleton transferred over $2 million to his ""personal accounts"" after receiving a Wells notice on July 26, 2019, suggesting a risk of asset dissipation. ""Mr. Middleton, after being notified of the Wells notice, transferred over $2 million to his personal accounts,"" Tenreiro told the court ([120-9.pdf](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmcnzWvmYiHCAALeSAgRcTCZ7BatNC776a8jpgB62zT2QX)), painting a picture of a defendant scrambling to hide funds.However, Middleton contends this was a blatant lie. The Kraken account, he argues, belonged to Veritaseum, LLC—not him personally—a fact the SEC knew but concealed. Evidence supporting this claim emerges from the SEC’s own proposed TRO order, which listed the Kraken account as belonging to Veritaseum, LLC ([DOC\_119\_MEM\_SPRT.pdf,](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/Qma7PZLhAR1mV5MsPudvjDYm5Za1rJGkhjFuxyQ4eeMKMW) p. 15). Furthermore, a supplemental declaration from SEC Blockchain Data Scientist Patrick Doody later acknowledged the account’s corporate status ([DOC\_119\_MEM\_SPRT](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/Qma7PZLhAR1mV5MsPudvjDYm5Za1rJGkhjFuxyQ4eeMKMW).pdf, p. 10), contradicting his first declaration that labeled it as Middleton’s personal account ([DOC\_119\_MEM\_SPRT.pdf](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/Qma7PZLhAR1mV5MsPudvjDYm5Za1rJGkhjFuxyQ4eeMKMW), p. 13). Below is a table found in the ([DOC\_119\_MEM\_SPRT.pdf,](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/Qma7PZLhAR1mV5MsPudvjDYm5Za1rJGkhjFuxyQ4eeMKMW) p. 15) showing during the TRO hearing, Mr. Tenriero himself, admitting the Kraken account was in fact ""business addresses"" ([120-9.pdf](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmcnzWvmYiHCAALeSAgRcTCZ7BatNC776a8jpgB62zT2QX), p. 29-30). Following this, Judge Hall ""decided to not freeze Mr. Middleton's personal accounts, but instead only those of the business"" again confirming the corporate status of the accounts. ([120-9.pdf](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmcnzWvmYiHCAALeSAgRcTCZ7BatNC776a8jpgB62zT2QX), p. 29, 40). The Court continued by asking ""Now, can someone tell me with respect to the Kraken account, is that a traditional bank account? Mr. Tenreiro ""It's not a traditional bank account, but it's an account that we can serve a freeze order on."" Emphasis added. ([120-9.pdf](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmcnzWvmYiHCAALeSAgRcTCZ7BatNC776a8jpgB62zT2QX), p. 40 line 17) DOC\_119\_MEM\_SPRT.pdf, p. 15In reference to the $2 million alleged as dissipation of assets, Middleton’s attorney, David Kornblau, countered during the TRO hearing that these transfers were routine business transactions, occurring every six months for eighteen months and fully disclosed during the SEC’s two-year investigation. ""What I found out is roughly six months before he had transferred the same amount and roughly six months before then he had transferred the same amount,"" Kornblau explained ([120-9.pdf](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmcnzWvmYiHCAALeSAgRcTCZ7BatNC776a8jpgB62zT2QX), p. 12). Yet, the court, relying on the SEC’s narrative pushed by Tenreiro,“So I don’t have anything to balance their argument but to accept it as true…” ([DOC\_119\_MEM\_SPRT.pdf,](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/Qma7PZLhAR1mV5MsPudvjDYm5Za1rJGkhjFuxyQ4eeMKMW) p. 21) – Judge Hall, granted a modified TRO, freezing business assets and ordering expedited discovery ([120-9.pdf](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmcnzWvmYiHCAALeSAgRcTCZ7BatNC776a8jpgB62zT2QX), p. 35).

# Witness Intimidation: Silencing the Defense

Adding fuel to the fire, Middleton alleges that the SEC intimidated witnesses to suppress testimony in his favor. Affidavits from Michael Sheahan and Lloyd Cupp paint a chilling picture of coercion. Sheahan, a Veritaseum community member and beta tester, submitted an affidavit supporting Middleton in August 2019. The SEC swiftly subpoenaed him for a deposition, which he describes as ""aggressive, abusive, and threatening,"" with threats of felony charges for his support and YouTube activity showcasing VeADIR platform.""It was clear this meeting was intended to scare me into silence,"" Sheahan wrote, noting that the ordeal cost him his YouTube channel and halted his advocacy ([120-11.pdf](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmYZ5HWJQ8HeYSkQPbRf4f6TAcWRd8yCz7ze8FfBviqrXb), p. 2).Similarly, Cupp recounts an unsolicited call from Tenreiro in June 2018, urging him to testify against Middleton as a victim of a Ponzi scheme. When Cupp refused, asserting VERI’s utility status, Tenreiro pressed him to reconsider. ""I told Mr. Tenreiro that I did not consider myself a victim,"" Cupp affirmed, rejecting the SEC’s narrative ([120-12.pdf,](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmV56EoPjQs4kfxnFqujf3p125Foo1fmaZT2VN5GuuL9qM) p. 2). These actions, Middleton argues, were designed to chill exculpatory testimony, further corrupting the judicial process.

# A Pattern of Misconduct?

Middleton’s motion draws a striking parallel to SEC v. Dig. Licensing Inc. (DebtBox), where a Utah federal judge sanctioned the SEC $1.8 million in 2024 for fabricating evidence to obtain a TRO and asset freeze. In that case, the SEC falsely claimed DebtBox closed 33 bank accounts in 48 hours and liquidated $720,000, misrepresentations the court deemed ""materially false and misleading"" ([DOC\_119\_MEM\_SPRT.pdf](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/Qma7PZLhAR1mV5MsPudvjDYm5Za1rJGkhjFuxyQ4eeMKMW), p. 4). The judge emphasized the SEC’s ""special duty to act with integrity,"" a duty Middleton claims was breached in his case as well.The defendants highlight a pattern of pre-litigation misconduct, including threats to enforce unserved subpoenas and attempts to use a forged document during Middleton’s testimony. Seibert’s declaration details how Tenreiro mocked Middleton during a November 2017 interview and tried to impeach him with a fabricated document, only exposed when breaks were denied ([DOC\_120\_SEIB\_DECL.pdf](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmXzbMwxC7NErAunjSYn5PTF1P9k6fpL4HdMCU4Jd9Gwj8), p. 5). This, they argue, reflects a broader strategy of dishonorable behavior violating the SEC’s duty under SEC v. ESM Government Securities to act honorably ([DOC\_119\_MEM\_SPRT.pdf](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/Qma7PZLhAR1mV5MsPudvjDYm5Za1rJGkhjFuxyQ4eeMKMW), p. 3).

# The Coerced Settlement

The case culminated in a consent judgment on October 31, 2019, imposing $8.47 million in disgorgement and a $1 million civil penalty on Middleton ([DOC\_119\_MEM\_SPRT.pdf](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/Qma7PZLhAR1mV5MsPudvjDYm5Za1rJGkhjFuxyQ4eeMKMW), p. 14). Even though Middleton neither admitted or denied the allegations, he contends this outcome was not a fair resolution but a forced capitulation, driven by the asset freeze that left him unable to fund his defense. ""The TRO’s pressure, coupled with subsequent intimidation and concealment, left Reggie Middleton with little choice but to settle,"" the motion states ([DOC\_119\_MEM\_SPRT.pdf](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/Qma7PZLhAR1mV5MsPudvjDYm5Za1rJGkhjFuxyQ4eeMKMW), p. 17).The defendants now seek to vacate this judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(d)(3), which allows courts to set aside judgments for fraud on the court—intentional misconduct by officers of the court that corrupts judicial integrity. They argue that the SEC’s actions meet this standard, supported by clear and convincing evidence like the TRO hearing transcript and witness affidavits ([DOC\_119\_MEM\_SPRT.pdf](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/Qma7PZLhAR1mV5MsPudvjDYm5Za1rJGkhjFuxyQ4eeMKMW), p. 19-20).

# A Questionable Witness and Flawed Evidence

Further bolstering their case, the defendants point to the SEC’s use of Michael Middleton (no relation) as a witness, whose declaration claimed investment losses ([DOC\_119\_MEM\_SPRT.pdf](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/Qma7PZLhAR1mV5MsPudvjDYm5Za1rJGkhjFuxyQ4eeMKMW), p. 13). Yet, his deposition reveals a traumatic brain injury affecting his memory, casting doubt on his reliability. ""I was in a coma for two weeks, and I have some brain damage,"" he admitted ([120-10.pdf](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmVToo1vdLE8zBKwDaXeh7hBDiKzie2K7C4j55bCFwWdGa), p. 17), unsure of basic details about his alleged investment ([120-10.pdf](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmVToo1vdLE8zBKwDaXeh7hBDiKzie2K7C4j55bCFwWdGa), p. 14-15). The defendants question why the SEC relied on such a witness, suggesting it was a desperate move to prop up a weak case.Additionally, SEC Staff Accountant Roseann Daniello’s financial analyses contained errors she later corrected, undermining the dissipation narrative. ""Her August 12, 2019 Declaration represented as certain fact totals for various international wires, which she later admitted were incorrect,"" the motion notes ([DOC\_119\_MEM\_SPRT.pdf](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/Qma7PZLhAR1mV5MsPudvjDYm5Za1rJGkhjFuxyQ4eeMKMW), p. 12), highlighting the SEC’s rush to court with incomplete data.

# The Stakes and What’s Next

Middleton’s motion demands the judgment be vacated, his frozen assets returned, the complaint dismissed without prejudice, and attorney fees awarded since October 2017. Alternatively, they request an evidentiary hearing to probe the SEC’s actions. The stakes are high: a ruling in Middleton’s favor could signal greater accountability for regulatory overreach, particularly in the cryptocurrency space where unclear rules often clash with innovation.The SEC may counter that the motion is untimely, coming 5.5 years after the judgment, or that Middleton settled knowingly, waiving his claims. Yet, FRCP 60(d)(3), Fraud Upon the Court, has no time limit, and precedents like Pumphrey v. K.W. Thompson Tool Co. suggest settlement doesn’t bar relief if fraud is egregious ([DOC\_119\_MEM\_SPRT.pdf](https://outer-peach-tapir.myfilebase.com/ipfs/Qma7PZLhAR1mV5MsPudvjDYm5Za1rJGkhjFuxyQ4eeMKMW), p. 24). The discrepancy between the SEC’s filings and the Kraken account’s ownership, coupled with witness intimidation allegations, presents a compelling case for judicial review.

# Broader Implications

The cryptocurrency industry has long decried the SEC’s aggressive tactics and murky guidelines. Middleton’s fight adds a potent narrative to this critique, suggesting the agency may bend the truth to win. Whether Judge William F. Kuntz II vacates the judgment or orders a hearing, the outcome will reverberate through the crypto community, challenging the power dynamics between regulators and innovators. As the legal battle unfolds in the Eastern District of New York, one truth emerges: Middleton’s allegations, backed by court documents and sworn affidavits, demand scrutiny. For now, the question lingers—did the SEC play fair, or did it stack the deck to silence a blockchain pioneer?

Positioned as one of Xoocity’s core infrastructures, XooRWA lets brands convert their influence into a participatory, rich experience for users, turning passive consumers into active co-creators.

**Redefining Brand Engagement: From Consumption to Collaboration**

Instead of conventional ads or loyalty points, XooRWA allows brands to issue utility-driven digital assets that offer value to people for promoting, using, and co-building the brand itself. Rooted in a “Brand as Asset” vision, XooRWA’s smart-contract framework guarantees transparent, fair, and value-sharing incentives.

**Platform Highlights**

* **Digital Goods Issuance System:** Launch digital assets embedded with real-world utilities and privileges.
* **Multi-Phase Incentive Model:** Blend short-term virality and long-term loyalty through “incentive” and “contract” periods.
* **On-Chain Execution + AI Distribution:** Smart contracts automate withdrawals with full transparency.
* **XooToken Value System:** Users can get XooTokens plus redeemable real-world perks for every asset interaction.

**Real-World Pilot: Cuplore Shared Coffee Stores**

Cuplore, a smart coffee chain with 100+ locations, is XooRWA’s first industry partner. Ten pilot stores now integrate XooRWA-enabled digital products, letting customers unlock discounts, promo bonuses, and XooToken incentives, turning everyday coffee runs into collaborative value creation.

**Xoocity Ecosystem Synergy: Building the Web3 Commercial OS**

XooRWA is a pillar of Xoocity: a virtual-physical operating system for digital-native enterprises. Xoocity unites XooRWA with:

* Xoobay (Web3 cross-border e-commerce)
* Xooer (AI assistant)
* XooToken (gives back the value in the form of token)

Incubated by Google Cloud and Hong Kong Science & Technology Park, Xoocity’s integrated stack lets brands tokenize influence, share value with users, and plug into the wider Web3 economy.

1l1gz64,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadasWonderland/comments/1l1gz64/a_few_notes_on_wonderland/,A few Notes on Wonderland,"Manchu Wok got a lot worse. They used to give you good portions on a plate, now you just get a small box container. Plus every other food options gets a side, at Manchu the dish is considered the meat, and the side is rice or noodles, even though they would not usually be ordered separately and are put together. 

The only good privite place to power nap (15-30 min) I've found is behind the shed walking into Flight Deck. There's a curb to sit on and the building wall to lean against. The only way anyone could see you is if someone was sitting on the curb directly to the right side of the building, which does happen. 


Power Plugs:

(Good if you have a fast charger.)

In the lobby of the Wonder mountin washroom. 

Behind pop machines 

Medieval Faire right side wall once thorugh the arch.   
(if no food festival) 

Front inside doors of Coasters Dinner   
(some ppl sit here on the floor)  

The pathway to Behemoth   
(Haven't tested these)  

The lines are the lest busy at the very opening and last hour of the day. Plus when the weater is bad. Always best to come at open. 

It takes an hour and a half from downtown Toronto to get to the park, plan accordingly.   
(And I'm gonna be late for writting this post)

The Bat single rider lane doesn't make anysence. They make that line wait for single riders coming from the normal line. Defeats the purpose. 

The Behemoth SRL is faster than the Fast Pass line. 

The lest used bathroom is the one just ouside the gates to the right. 

The only bathrooms with mirrors are:  

Bathroom just before Kidzville
By Lumber Jack Climb  

Bathroom by the Arcade and Medical Building
in Medieval Faire  



When the Flight Deck has no line instead of going ALL the way around, just use the Fast Lane, they won't make you scan. 

Tundra Twister is boaring.   

The flat rides are easy to get on, espesially Lumberjack even when the park is busy.  Often the Sledge Hammer, Shockwave and Lumberjack are more thrilling than the coasters. 

Soaring Timbers needs a minimum of 10 people to run. 

Thunder Run always has a big line up because it appeals to the youngest in the crowd and the parents also go on.  

Even though I go on all the coasters the most unsettaling is Drop Tower and Windseeker.   

Muskoka Plunge in the water park is terrifying. They put you in a chamber like a bullet, shut the door, and the floor is removed under you. You then get kind of water boarded was you can't breath with all the water splashed up from your feet. But it's the drop that has no exact timing that's the worst anticipation. 

I find it hard to spin the planes on Skyhawk

Sometimes it feels weird going in line with the little kids but Boo Blasters is fun, and they let you on just fine. Same for Flying Eagles. I wouldn't bother with anything eles in KidZville.

Vortex is not worth a long line up, as the ride is over very fast. 

Gaurdian Mountain is not worth a long line up as the score pictures are still broken, and if you've done it once you're good for a long while. 

The meal plan is essential, the drink plan is pretty good for the price. Not sure about good for the health though!   
(Even if only getting diet) 

Cherry Pibb Zero, and Mellow Yello Zero are the best from the drink fountin. Pibb is Coke's version of Dr. Pepper, and you really should look up the history of Mellow Yello on Wikipedia, You're welcome? 

The front side seat on Yukon Striker is a whole new expierence.   

There's a dollaramma that's a 20 min walk to the north by the McDonalds. 

When walking into the park if you use the left gate they send you though without bag check as long as you don't set off the metal detector (I never have). I have as yet to sneak anything in like food or drink but looks possible.  

Drinks are very expensive in the park, go to St. Louis Bar & Grill across the street. 

Season pass holders get Perks for going a number of times. At four you get a free bring a friend pass. 

With a Playcard for the Arcade you get a free game every visit. 

The only poutine on the meal plan is in KidZville but it's a normal size portion.  

Buying another season pass instead of renewing in August will get you double use add-on's as they will be valid for rest of this year and next, plus you still have your origional. Four meals anyone?  

The water park and hitting all the rides on a busy day is hard to do, if only buying a day ticket. 

The Dragon Fyre and the two wodden coasters are rickety and hurt a bit. 

Flight Deck hurts a lot, mashes your ears. Use a hoodie or only do it once per visit.   

Tight glasses are usually safe on rides, do not wear on Flight Deck as it will smash agaist your nose bridge. 

Funnel cakes are overrated. Good only for the first two bites.  

Always scan your season pass when buying anything as you get a discount. If you have an extra 20% discount it's one use only so don't scan it on a cheap coffee.

Then he’d bring me coffee and breakfast in bed. It was a fancy coffee. He loved espresso machines and frothing the milk. Usually breakfast would be berries in oatmeal with honey. Or eggs and some fruit with our homemade sour dough bread.

Every day we would have sex. Every single day. We were abnormally attracted to one another.

If I wasn’t working, then I’d be bothering him as he was coding and inventing something new for his company. He’d be knee deep in a new revelation and I’d start long winded talks about life or quantum physics. He’d get side tracked while we debated then go back to inventing.

Then I would start baking or cooking from scratch to impress him with my skills. He called me “Chef Midas.”

Every night we would eat, do chores for the kids, then cuddle and watch our shows. 

Gosh we laughed and smiled so much.

If someone asked me 10 years ago what happiness looked life, it would’ve been us looking into each other’s eyes.

I read that most people have rose colored glasses after death. But I actually wrote about and spoke about our love constantly while we were together.

When and why coffee become part of North American daily life is at the center of my book *Coffee Nation: How One Commodity Transformed the Early United States.* 

I'm a historian of early American history with a particular interest in trade and consumer behavior. I used a wide range of archival, quantitative, and material evidence to follow coffee from the slavery-based plantations of the Caribbean and South America, through the balance sheets of Atlantic world merchants, into the coffeehouses, stores, and homes of colonial North Americans, and ultimately to the growing import/export businesses of the early nineteenth-century United States that rebranded this exotic good as an American product. The result is a sweeping history that explores how coffee shaped the lives of enslaved laborers and farmers, merchants and retailers, consumers and advertisers.

Disclaimer, this ended up being longer than I expected, also messier, it's just what I have in my mind right now, I'm very sorry for the length. I guess I just wanted to share that with someone so I thank you if you take the time to read. 

I stumbled upon this subreddit just a few hours ago and it's turned me upside down. It started from a post I saw on another subreddit about someone being the happiest of his life after selling his gaming computer and I can't stop thinking about it. 


I'm pretty sure I have all the signs of being an addict. I say this in the casual sense of it, in the same way I know I'm addicted to sugar and probably coffee. I don't think I spend too much time playing (maybe 2 ~ 3 hours every 2~3 days) and I put all my duties before gaming. I have a stable job, I cook and take care of chores in the household and spend time with my wife when I am with her, and sleep 8 hours a night. 


The thing is, gaming is probably taking ALL of the remaining time. And I feel like I never have enough. I contently think about the games I play and I am frustrated when I don't. Below is a list of the main issues this creates:


First and main one, I am jumping on the computer the second my wife needs to go somewhere and I'm home alone. I'm thinking of it as my own ""free time"" but it is never anything else than gaming. I'm also reading a book these days but I'm only doing it during transit from work to home because at home it would feel like a ""waste of gaming time"". 


Second is tied to the first, I sometimes even look forward times where my wife is going to her martial art classes or need to go to her parents for a couple of days (they live abroad). In this case I even become a degenerate that can play for 12 hours straight and neglect my duties as long as I clean everything shiny just before she comes back and of course I would be ashamed of telling her I did during the week end. I absolutely hate myself for being ""happy"" that my loved one is away for a while.


Third, I neglect my friends and potential other hobbies for gaming time. I'm not taking care of my relationships at all, and I wish I was doing more things outside of my bubble than just gaming. 


Below is a list of things of random thoughts I have on the topic:


The best years of my life where the 3 years I was living abroad and didn't have access to my computer. I was hiking countless times a week, doing a lot of sport, ran a half marathon, made friends from all over the world, had boardgame nights with strangers, made friendships by just engaging with strangers, etc... 


I have an extreme FOMO about selling my computer. I am addicted to Path of Exile and the game is currently at its peak interest. I have a backlog of incredible solo games to do and I'm currently having the time of my life on expedition 33. I can imagine hearing about a new PoE league or a new release from Larian Studio and not being able to try it out, it feels excruciating just thinking about it. 


I am scared that selling my computer would just bring me to another passive addiction, an even worse one. Namely I spend way too much time on reddit and YouTube and these are actually even more worthless than gaming. If I end up spending my time on these instead of gaming it would be a net negative for my life. 


I do other things than gaming on my computer. I sometimes code (and love it, wish I'd do more) and board game design (same), photo editing, and I love that my beefy computer can do all this easily. My laptop would sweat just by opening photoshop. 


I got married very recently and even if I'm spending most of my time with my wife, I feel I'm not making anywhere near enough effort to make our life interesting. I want to spend my time planning things for us, making surprises, doing something impulsive and fun, etc... 


I don't want to completely lose my passion of games either, I want to share that with my futur kids, we also (VERY RARELY) play with my wife to some casual games (she enjoys it, but has ultimately enough after one or two hours). 


I'm sorry again for the very long post, feel free to share anything related to what I said, I don't even know what kind of reply I'm expecting but it somehow feels good to share.

I (38M) had been chatting with someone (34F) for a couple of week. We got on great, both outdoorsy, countryside lovers, city dislikers etc. We met for a coffee date last week, had a great 2 hour chat, not even really noticing that the place had closed. Fast forward to yesterday, we went on a countryside walk together. This was another few hours of great chats and laughs. I walk her back to her car, and we kiss goodbye. Not a quick kiss, a few minutes, quite 'intimate', the sort where you feel ""they're definitely into you"". We say goodbye and we both head off home. I am, of course, getting my hopes up thinking that went well and am looking forward to seeing her again. I text her to ask if she got home ok (she lives about an hour away) and after a while get a reply saying that she had a great time and thinks I'm a really nice guy but she doesn't have any romantic feelings for me. Boom, hopes dashed again. 

Now I can't fault someone for not having feelings for someone else, but this time the mixed signals just destroyed me. My brain just can't reconcile how things were when we said goodbye and the text message an hour and a half later. It wasn't like I kissed her without warning, I asked first and she seemed extremely into it. She could have just said something right then and there, or if not could have said ""maybe next time"" and then headed off before sending the text. I hop back on Bumble to unmatch and she's also deleted her account, which does seem a bit odd.

If I'd just been rejected at the time, it wouldn't have been so bad, but that hour and half where I had my hopes up just made it 10x worse, even though I did remind myself a couple of times to not let my hopes go too high yet!",6,1748867661.0,dating,8,0.87,False

I've had IBS for a while, I want to say it started around 2019? Or that's when I noticed a pattern. I've read numerous posts about dumping syndrome and I'm confused. I thought it was just diarrhea. However some accounts sound more like food poisoning... ie hugging the porcelain throne, feeling weak, lethargic, diaphoretic, etc. There have been times when an IBS flare has made me question everything like should I eat at all? Lol. For example this morning I had coffee around 16oz. Half nespresso and half Keurig. I'm pretty sure I drank that yesterday without issue. Today, I'm taking immodium because clearly I have pissed off my insides and they're actively waging war with me. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS: If you've had IBS is it similar to dumping?

Then there’s my boyfriend (23M). He, on the other hand, grew up in an unaffectionate household where raising voices is a part of their everyday lives. He also grew up with vices (smoking and drinking). 

I rarely drink and I despise the smell of cigarettes. Guess what he did? He barely drinks anymore and he quitted smoking. He prepares my coffee every morning if andon ako sa kanila. Without fail. But what got me sobbing is what happened yesterday. I was sleeping around noon when I woke up to him standing up, turning the AC on, putting a two blankets over me and then kissing my forehead when he thought I was still sleeping. And then gumising ako, I asked him why he turned the AC on, if naiinitan ba sya. He said, “Hindi. Natutulog ka kasi tapos mabilis ka mainitan kaya in-on ko para di maputol tulog mo.”

I am feeling demoralized by what I am perceiving as a lack of ""good enough"" progress. 

My starting stats: 65 inches - 164.6 lbs on 28April 
I was tracking here (and have been tracking for ages, previously using cronometer) with macros around 1800 cal, 150 protein, 60 fat, and 165 carbs. 

I started macrofactor and, as expected, I lost a decent chunk of water weight in the first two weeks putting me around 159/158 lbs. However, three weeks later I'm still 158 lbs despite constant reductions in calories. I track everything with my food scale, oil, coffee creamer, veggies, etc. (the blank days in my screenshots are from vacations where I was still mindful but unable to track). 

I have just finished an 8 week 4x/week upper/lower lifting routine and am about to start a new 3x/week full body routine. I use rowing for cardio 3-4x/week and I average between 7-10k steps a day, I dont drink alcohol and consume very little soda/non-water beverages. 

Last week my calories dropped to 1467 and then this week it told me to decrease to 1350 which I declined because I'm already feeling a little sluggish in the gym. Should I just push through? 

I'm feeling stumped. I am thinking maybe my body is going through a recomposition or maybe I've been impatient? I am going to start training for a Marathon in August and wanted to be finished with my cut by then (my original predicted end date was mid July :( but it no longer feels possible since it doesn't feel like anything is moving). 

I am going to keep going, I'm just hoping for some words of encouragement or advice.

Now just because i lost all the weight doesn’t mean i did it correctly, i didn’t have a well planned strength training routine so i lost quite alot of muscle and now I’m in an awkward skinny fat phase. Because I’m quite skinny but have a bit of fat to lose i decided to change my mindset of losing weight to maintaining while recomposing my body by building muscle and losing fat. My body recomposition was going great for months with my diet being a good 80/20 split of healthy foods to foods that i enjoy, life was great and i felt amazing. 2025 so far has had to be the most stressful my life has ever been which i think is a contributing factor to my binging, i turned 16, take college level classes while being a sophomore, go to the gym, trying to be as dialed in as possible on my diet, I’m apart of a mariachi band in school and outside of school with the one outside of school having rehearsals up until 9pm and the one in school having performances every now and then, and then trying to keep a positive attitude most of the time while being mentally and physically drained. Safe to say i have been really busy but to be honest i enjoy having to be on my feet 24/7 because it means theres never a dull moment and when i do have days to do absolutely nothing it feels earned and makes it so much better. One day in April i had to finish an essay and i stayed up until 4am to finish it. After finishing it i was really hungry and decided to eat all of my calories for the day (i sometimes do OMAD or one meal a day when i feel really hungry because of my massive appetite). While fasting for the rest of the day my parents asked the question that i was dreading because of how much of a willpower struggle it would be, “do you want something to eat?” i originally said no but i gave up and said to myself “you know what, a grilled chicken sandwich from whataburger and a diet coke isnt going to ruin my progress. My parents then came home with my sandwich and some pupusas with fried chicken. I ended up eating the sandwich, 4 pupusas and probably 10 chicken tenders. I don’t know why but i ended telling myself “you know what im going to eat everything in the pantry” and i ate an entire box of hostess coffee cakes. I felt horrible, i was hot, my heart was racing probably because i keep my added sugar intake quite low, below 30 grams most days and that day i probably ate upwards of 200+ and i was so beyond the point of full that i felt like throwing up. I woke up the next morning and felt horrible but not surprisingly i looked in the mirror and saw 0 change in how i looked, and i knew i wasn’t just gonna gain 10 pounds of fat in a day, so i got right back on track with my normal diet, until a week later i ended up binging again, and then got back on track for a week, and binged again. This cycle has been going on for the past 2 months and if you ever lost a lot of weight you know your biggest fear is gaining the weight back, and this fear is becoming my reality. I’ve been binging all week and i looked in the mirror and my pretty sharp jawline that i had just a couple months ago is half gone, every time i walk i now feel a little jiggle in my stomach, and the loose skin on my stomach that i once saw as an achievement after losing so much weight has filled up with fat that i can actually grab when normally (i know this is going to sound weird) im able to stretch it out in front of me and catch water in it in the shower. i feel horrible and i know i can get back on track and lose this fat but after a week or so i just end up binging again, its not even like im punishing myself for binging with endless amounts of cardio and massive calorie deficits, i put myself in a 500 calorie deficit and then a couple weeks later i just let my massive appetite get the better of me. I feel its quite ironic how i never had a eating disorder before when i was extremely overweight, i was just eating too much, but now that im at a healthy weight i begin to binge, is it because of all the stress going on in my life right now? I have no idea but this summer im going to accept that what i have done is in the past and lighten the load by telling myself that i was just bulking, because i have been lifting for the past 2 months and made a lot of progress, and now im gonna cut down and get back in shape.",3,1748866448.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

I’m in a bit of a transitional phase in life right now — you could say I’m in the process of rediscovering myself. It’s one of those times where I’m reflecting more, trying to figure out what truly makes me happy, and learning to enjoy my own company too.

That said, I’d love to make some new, genuine friendships along the way. I'm open to chatting, meeting for coffee, exploring the city, or even just sharing random thoughts and laughs online. I believe the right kind of friendships can really help you grow and feel understood, especially during times like these.

If this resonates with you or you’re in a similar phase of life, feel free to drop a message. Let’s connect and see where it goes 🌼

Take care!",3,1748866414.0,Hyderabadgirlshangout,5,1.0,False
