1jmn259,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1jmn259/varying_blood_pressure/,Varying blood pressure,"Hello everyone. I’m an EMT/nursing student with a boyfriend who’s currently studying to get his EMT certification. He had to practice how to take blood pressures on patients, so I showed him how to take a manual blood pressure by doing it on him and explaining it step by step. 
But when I took his blood pressure (manually, with the right sized cuff), it was 180/90. Obviously I was concerned. He had no headache, no pain no shortness of breath no nothing. Then I decided I’d take a systolic BP using his radial pulse. It was completely normal. Taking it with an automatic wrist cuff at home also showed normal readings (around 120/80). 

He’s a pretty healthy guy, goes to the gym for weightlifting (he’s huge… but doesn’t take any steroids. Completely natural. Consumes an adequate amount of protein to look the way he does), doesn’t seem stressed (I’m usually more stressed than he is), and eats fine. He gained a bit of weight since I’ve met him a year ago because I spoil him with my cooking, but otherwise he eats pretty balanced. 

The only things I can think of that would contribute is he drinks coffee in the morning (two shots, but it’s not enough to bring shoot a BP that high up… I think?) and he doesn’t get the best sleep. He needs melatonin to sleep properly. And maybe also his biceps are big? Lots of muscle? Maybe it changes things? idk. 
 
I know the blood pressure from an arm to wrist can vary slightly, but would it really vary that much? I’m confused. I hope I gave enough context lol. ",1,1743257276.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Purchasing a few pieces from her has created quite an addiction and I have scoured estate sales and online resources for additions to my collection. For me, putting on a kimono is akin to tying an Hermes scarf around my neck, eating some sort of decadently rare caviar or drinking coffee in bed. Privileges that I absolutely do NOT take for granted. I walk taller, feel more powerful and in that, cultivate a generally more benevolent mood.  I recently bought a Furisode that is incredibly beautiful and I have decided that I may just never take it off. I am 48 years old, married, Texan, hakujin. And, I do not think it makes me look younger. Rather, it makes me feel more like a powerful version of myself. Elegant, impractical and ready to take on the world. I do not wear an obi or any other traditional garments with this. Because I have always loved garments imbued with history and meaning, I have thought a LOT about this. My conclusion is that it is best to have reverence in the context of what you are using the object for even if it is not what was originally intended. I probably would, for example, wear an Authentic Native American headdress-yes, even one from a shaman if it landed in my possession, but not one mass produced from plastic to Burning Man.

### **For Your Consideration**  

#### **Scene: The Movie Theater (Post-Credits Reverie)**  

The theater lights come up.  

**Eleven people remain in their seats.**  

They don’t know each other. They didn’t come together. But none of them move.  

A long silence. The credits keep rolling. Somewhere, an usher coughs.  

**“So… we talking about this, or what?”**  

A few nods. Someone exhales like they’ve been holding their breath.  

They turn in their seats, **forming a loose, semi-circle.**  

- **A guy in a scarf:** *“That was… a lot.”*  
- **A woman adjusting her glasses:** *“I think I need to process.”*  
- **A quiet voice from the back:** *“It was beautiful.”*  

The group **lets the silence sit.** Not awkward—**respectful.** Then, the conversation **gently lifts off.**  

- **Someone starts a deep analysis.**  
  *“I mean, if you look at it structurally—”*  
- **Someone else cuts in, laughing.**  
  *“Okay, but did anyone else just feel *wrecked* by that third act?”*  
- **A contrarian stirs the pot.**  
  *“I actually think it was overrated.”*  
  *Some wince, but no one attacks.* Instead: “Interesting. Say more.”*  

They talk. They linger.  

An usher clears their throat. **They are being ushered.**  

The eleven **shuffle as a unit** into the lobby, still talking, reluctant to let the night end.  

---

#### **Scene: The Roaming Begins**  

Outside, the air is crisp. The streets are still alive, but **the eleven have no destination.**  

- Someone suggests **another show.**
  *""A different tone, maybe?""*
- Someone suggests **coffee.**  
  *“A place that’s still open.”*  
- Someone suggests **walking.**  
  *“Let’s just… move.”*  

The consensus settles on **walking with intent but no goal.**  

**This is how it begins.**  

- A few new voices join in—the **doorman outside the theater, a passing cyclist who slows down.**  
- **Someone starts veering toward pretentiousness.**  
  *“If you think about it, we are the film now—”*  
  **“Dial it back, Jason.”**  
- **Someone tries to start a chant.**  
  *“Let’s not do that.”*  

They keep moving. **Still talking.** Not inordinate. Not yet.  

Just **eleven people who refuse to let the reverie end.**

1jmmzcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1jmmzcb/working_solo/,working solo,"For context I work for a chain that sells both donuts and coffee in takeaway cups:

Our store is quite small and is situated in a shopping centre, there is usually one of us on shift, sometimes two on the weekends. I would say no matter what day it is, the amount of customers that come at once can be so unpredictable which makes getting everything else done very difficult, and I’m not sure if I’m the only one who is finding this to be an issue that there’s only one person on staff. 

We have to take coffee orders, and we have to sell donuts, we also have to cook pies and stock up the store. We have to take in-store phone calls and make orders, we have to complete online orders, and we have to clean and there is always customers piling at the register. Now all of this is basic responsibilities of any barista/food assistant, however it feels like way too much for one person to complete. It comes to a point, where I feel guilty that it’s getting busy despite the fact I’m going as fast as I can and avoiding mistakes at the same time, which can be difficult to do when you’re working under pressure. Customers have made comments to us about only one person being on shift and how we need more people(I agree.) and how slow and inconsistent our service can be because of that.

I’m just wondering if this has been an issue for anybody else? As much as I quite enjoy working alone because I do get to go at my own pace, choose my own music, etc. the downside of it is that it can get crazy busy, like crazy busy and it’s all up to me to do all the things listed above in such a small timeframe. As much as I love my job, this can be demanding at times and so much for the little money that I make, I don’t know if small chain stores are similar. Every coffee shop around us always has 2-3 people on shift and it makes me wonder if me being ‘slow’ is like a skill issue or what not. ",1,1743257039.0,barista,0,1.0,False

1jmmuon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1jmmuon/what_is_the_best_low_skill_brewer/,What is the best low skill brewer?,"I recently got a grinder and I've been using a moccamaster to batch brew coffee but sometimes I just want  a mid sized cup for myself.  I've used an aeropress before and found it to be really good but I'm not sure if that'll be the best brewer for every roast level etc. Price isnt too concerning but I dont want to overpay for either fractional differences or overly expensive filters in the long run. I would get a standard V60 in the future but right now it feels quite overwhelming learning grindsizes, roast levels, if i like washed or natural coffee without me adding my own lack of experience brewing a good cup. Essentially I dont want my lack of gooseneck kettle and skill to be another variable or failure point.

The brewers available to me are:

The aeropress/aeropress colour for €44/48 

The clever dripper for €35

Hario V60 switch for €63

Nextlevel Pulsar for €73

The Pulsar seemed the most interesting to me but the price of the filters and the actual unit costing a decent amount more than any other method is what has made me reconsider it.

They all seem like decent brewers in there own right in one way or another but I'm mostly just looking for opinions by people who have owned one or mutliple of them and can draw an easier side by side comparison and what they'd be willing to spend on the brewer.

1jmmrt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1jmmrt3/florencevenice_trip_report_march_2025/,"Florence/Venice Trip Report, March 2025","Just returned from a packed time in Florence and Venice! It went very smoothly, and I wanted to share our itinerary and details.  We flew into Florence and out of Venice, and spent roughly three days in each place. We took a train between them, but didn’t use public transit at all in either spot (we averaged 7-9 miles per day!).

Participants: Me (37), Parents (70 and 71). Both are very fit and mobile (a few times, I thought they were going to out-pace me!). We are also the kind of people who love to have very full days packed with things to do (and you’ll see that in Florence in particular!). This was also my parents first (and probably only) time to see these cities, so they were very enthusiastic about “seeing it all”. I know this pace isn’t for everyone, but if this sounds like you, know that it is doable and fun. 

Weather: Ideal— 50/60s, with no rain and some sunshine. I was prepared for rain the entire time up to a few days before we left, but the forecast ended up shifting quite a bit. 

Food: loved all of our food. For dinner, we did a mixture of eating out and taking sandwiches/pizza/ snacks back to our Airbnb. While we weren’t aiming to be particularly frugal, I was reminded at how it’s possible to feed yourself very cheaply in both cities. We did pastries and cappuccino every morning, and for lunch, we usually found a pizza or sandwich place. 

FirenzeCard (FC): I decided to do the Firenze Card in Florence for a few reasons (and it worked out very well): one, I knew we wanted to take in a lot of sites, so the card would be an economical choice for us. Two, I started to get overwhelmed with planning to the day and hour when I had to book each site individually- with the FirenzeCard, it was so easy to just walk into places when we wanted to, rather than being tied to particular times (the two exceptions to this being the Uffizi and Accademia, of course). 

Food Tours: I was not into food tours until my mom wanted to do one in Paris— now, I’m hooked, especially in places like Italy. I found both of ours through Airbnb experiences and enjoyed them both. I like to do them early on (preferably on the first day) so we can return to places we liked. 

Transit: The tram (T2) in Florence was great for getting us to the train station from the airport — I thought about taking one of the city buses, but even with just carry-on luggage,  the buses were quite small and it could’ve been tight! So we just ended up walking to and from the train station since the weather was nice. To get to the airport in Venice, we took the ACTV bus (10 euros)— my flight was early, so I hopped on the 4:20AM one which was prompt and quick (there were also many people there for it, so I didn’t feel unsafe, even thought it was really early). 

Day 1: Florence
    -  11:45AM: arrived, collected FirenzeCard at airport, then took T2 to train station, then walked to Airbnb. 
    - 2:45-3:15: Orsanmichele Church and Museum (FC, walked right in)—great views of the city from 2nd and 3rd floors, and the entire site is very easy to do in a short period of time. 
    - 5:00-7:30PM: Florence Street Food Tour (Airbnb Experiences)

Day 2: Florence
    - 9AM: Galleria dell’Accademia di Firenze (FC, booked ahead of time via phone).
    - 11:15:  Uffizi Gallery (FC, booked ahead via phone)
    - Lunch at Airbnb
    - 3-5PM Medici Riccardi Palace (FC, walked right in) and Medici Chapelle (FC, walked right in)
    - 5:30PM: Sunset at Piazzale Michelangelo
- 	  Dinner out near Pitti Palace 

Day 3: Florence
    - 9AM: Duomo, Baptistry, Santa Reparta,  Climb Bell Tower (ran out of steam/time for the museum, unfortunately)
    - Lunch, 12PM Reservation: Osteria Filetto d'Oro
    - 1:30: Basilica di Santa Croce di Firenze (FC) and Florence Leather School (I bought a belt here and the artisan will add customizations, like your initials or a Florence image on the inside— very cool souvenir!)
    - 4:00PM: Museo de Palazzo Vecchio (FC, booked in FirenzeCard app) and climb Arnolfo Tower (FC, booked on website)
    - Dinner at Airbnb

Day 4: Florence/Train/Venice
    - AM: Bring coffee and pastries back to Airbnb, then walked around Santo 		Spirito before heading to train station
    - 11:40-1:50: Train to Venice (so smooth and easy!)
    - 4:00: Fondaco dei Tedeschi Rooftop Terrace (Free, book ahead of time)
    - 5:00-7:30: Venice Food Tour (Airbnb Experiences)

Day 5: 
    - 10AM: St. Mark’s Basilica
    - 2PM: Contarini Staircase of Bovolo (very quick— maybe 20 minute visit)
    - Afternoon: Gondola Ride/ Explore Venice

Day 6: 
    - 9AM: Doge’s Palace (spent longer here than I thought- close to two hours!)
    - 11:15: Correr Museum (did this because it was included when I booked the 	Doge’s Palace— nice, but we were definitely museumed-out, so we didn’t spent a lot of time here and breezed through some of galleries)
    - Lunch/Walk/Explore
    - 4:00: Tour of Venice Ghetto (highly recommend— we did an English tour that lasted about an hour)
    - Gelato, then dinner out for the last night

We find that the ""breakfast"" area in front of the stairs is too small for a table and just becomes wasted space. We would like more kitchen space and perhaps a coffee bar. 

- The angled void next to the stairs is for HVAC and must stay. The air intake faces the dining room side. 

- plumbing (sink) should remain where it is

- we do not need a formal dining room but would love a benched seating area or booth

- could move the garage entry door if needed 

- could replace the sliding patio door with something smaller if needed 

- would love a bigger pantry, perhaps a landing zone entry from the garage for shoes/coats

I made a few attempts but am struggling with flow and using the space efficiently, considering the stairs and basement access needs to stay.

1jmmltu,https://www.reddit.com/r/deathnote/comments/1jmmltu/how_l_actually_deduced_light_was_kira_confirmed/,How L Actually Deduced Light Was Kira – Confirmed by the Creator (Not Intuition),"I pointed this out in the subreddit in the past but not much ppl saw it so I'll try saying it again cus I think it's important. In *Death Note: How to Read 13* (page 70), an interviewer asks Ohba what tricks L used to test if any task force members were Kira. This refers to episode 6, where L mentions:

>""Before everyone leaves, I have prepared tricks to see if any of you is Kira or not""

Ohba’s answer? L used **the same tricks he used on Light** during their coffee shop conversation after the tennis match (episode 10) but with a twist.

# How L Knew Light Was Kira

Here’s where it gets interesting. According to Ohba, L already **knew Kira was highly intelligent**. The reason the task force members *passed* his test? They were too simple-minded to even keep up with him. L expected Kira to be **smart and egotistical enough to keep up with him**.

That means during the coffee shop scene, **Light was actually falling for L’s tricks**. If Light had just played dumb and pretended he didn’t understand, he could’ve thrown off suspicion. But no—he had to try to one-up L and prove his intelligence which only made him **more suspicious**.

# How L Deduced Kira Was Intelligent

Now, some of you might be wondering: *""But how did L even conclude that Kira was intelligent?""*

The answer lies in **Chapter 8**, when Kira sends L the message:

>""L do you know, Gods of Death, Love Apples""

Light sent this message to **distract L** while he took out the 12 FBI agents. But from **L’s perspective**, Kira had just **outsmarted the world’s greatest detective**, which is an *extremely rare* feat. At that moment, L **knew** Kira had to be someone highly intelligent.

# The ""1,500 Detectives Entering Japan"" Bluff

It gets even better. Remember when L was spying on Light and broadcasted the fake message about 1,500 detectives arriving in Japan?

Notice how L **smiles, starts giggling and his ""thinking music"" starts playing** when Light instantly sees through the bluff. L had told his team that Kira would panic, but in reality, he **expected the opposite**—he knew Kira would see through the bluff and act cocky.

That’s why, after Light's reaction, L started giggling to himself and ominously tells Soichiro:

>""Your son is clever, isn't he?""

Shortly after this, L reveals himself to Light. Most fans think this was based on *intuition*, but according to Ohba in an interview, L was already completely **confident** that Light was Kira **based on his deductions**.

(This also explains L's obsession with **testing Light’s intelligence** throughout the series, it's kinda funny rewatching those scenes knowing Light was just making himself more suspicious by ""passing"" L's Tests, L was toying with Light the whole series and Light didn't even know)

Let’s break it down from **L’s perspective**:

* Kira was definitely **one of the people being investigated by the 12 FBI Agents**.
* **Ray Penber was the most suspicious death** out of the 12 FBI Agents. (Which narrows it down to 2 families)
* Kira was one of the people being investigated during **december 14-19** (Which narrows it down to 1 family, the Yagami Family)
* Kira is **highly intelligent, cocky, has a strong sense of justice and most likely a highschool student**
* Out of Yagami's family, Light is the only one who is highly Intelligent, Cocky, has a strong sense of justice and is a highschool student

Light **perfectly** fits every single profile. At that point, how could L not suspect him? **L didn't make a logical leap or relied on intuition, he made a perfectly sensible deduction** (He just didn't share it cus according to the creator, he's secretive and didn't trust anyone which ultimately became his downfall)

This isn’t even a theory—it’s **confirmed by the author himself**. I just put two and two together, it wasn't that difficult. I feel like more ppl should be talking about this.",11,1743255921.0,deathnote,8,1.0,False

1jmmfbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perimenopause/comments/1jmmfbs/another_rage_post/,Another rage post,"Hi friends. I think I might murder the love of my life this morning. (Not really, please don't send me to reddit jail.) Here's the story: 

So I slept like shit like always but last night was worse than normal, up at like 3am and back to bed at 5, trying to get some amount of sleep. Hubs is peacefully snoring and doesn't notice the cats fighting or the dog needing fed and so I lay there for an hour and finally get up in a fit of rage that really has nothing to do with anyone.

So when he finally lazily rolls out of bed at 7am and gets settled on the couch for wordle, I casually just let him know that my rage is almost overwhelming this morning and I am just giving fair warning that I'm prolly gonna stay distant and solitary a bunch of today just so I don't end up throwing vitriol into his face. 

Yall, his ENTIRE affect changed. Like I had slapped him and like he was *pissed*. He just got all silent for like 5 mins and then said ""I don't know what I'm supposed to do with that"". I said well you could start by saying wow that sucks babe I'm sorry  it's starting so early. I said I was communicating what was happening inside my body just for him to know and maaaaybe give me som.extra grace if I snap at him about lunch plans or whatever thing. That my communicating this was my way of *trying* to keep all this rage in check and to mitigate some of the damages. And then he asks if there is something to make me be so mad because he was just trying to understand. NO YOU FUCKER I ALREADY TOLD YOU IT'S JUST RAGE. And also, if he wanted to know more, he could read the book he bought *me* about menopause so that *I* could better understand *the symptoms I am already experiencing*. That was the fight of 2 months ago- me seeing a book about menopause on the coffee table and being elated cuz I thought he had bought it for *him* to read so *he* could understand me more, but it was for *me* so that *I could be less crazy*.

Needless to say, my husband is... not doing well w my transition. At. All. He is the love of my life but he *sucks* at being supportive and communicative w feelings, and my feelings make him super uncomfortable. And so now I'm contemplating where to run to on this day so I don't *actually* say all the things I want to say to him... yall I want to knock him down so low verbally that he cries. I was trying to *warn* him and the help I was asking for was literally to just *be aware* of how volatile I feel today and maybe just maybe *empathize* a little. Not to take it personally or try to fix it or to get mad that this thing is happening. So instead of FREAKING THE FUCK OUT, I just decided I would type it all out here. This wall of word vomit. I don't even know what I'm saying anymore I'm so. Fucking. Tired.",6,1743255355.0,Perimenopause,8,1.0,False
1jmmf20,https://www.reddit.com/r/sluttyconfesdions/comments/1jmmf20/i_fucked_my_boss_to_get_promotion/,I fucked my boss to get promotion,"
So today I was so tired working overtime in the office. I removed my jacket, sipped my coffee and went to my boss's office to show him the final presentation.  He had just finished his online meeting so I knocked the door. He told me to come in. He seemed very frustrated and started staying how stressful it has been lately. 

I sat on the chair across him and I asked what happened. He told me his manager just resigned and he have lots of things to get handled. Damn...is he talking about that cheesy bitch?  The one who would always go around wearing that short dress of hers, showing cleavage and getting her work done around all men. God I hate her. But if I manage to get her position I would be having so much fun. Afterall I do know a lot better than her on how to get work done.

But how can I get her position  ? Just as I was thinking, boss gets up from his chair and comes towards me, slightly keeps his hand on the table, and starts saying how he is fed up of everything going on and just wants to relax sometims. He starts moving his fingers around the pen so seductively I almost bit my lips. 

All of a sudden he keeps his hand over my shoulders while I am sitting here getting heavy by it. I start explaining the presentation I was working on and suddenly one of his hands rest on my thicc thighs, and he starts pressing it in circular motion. I get so turned on by it. Fuck! I just remembered I forgot to wear my panties today. Boss's hand slides more inside me till he finally figures out that I wasn't wearing any panties. He said ""You want this. Don't you?""

I said,"" Yes boss"" and just like that he starts kissing me so vigorously that our tongue starts playing. I wrap my hands around his hair while his hands go more inside my pussy and starts fingering it round about my clitoris. A sexy moan comes out of my mouth which turns him on so bad.

He says fuck it and lifts me over his desk and tears my buttoned top apart to reveal my 34D tits in sexy black bra. I remove my skirt to reveal sexy wet pussy of mine while he unzips and throws his pants away to show his big dick.

 I start sucking his dick and I could hear his moan. He says nobody could ever give him a better bj like this. Just as he says that I suck his dick more inside so he could feel inside of my throat. ""Fuck"", he moans and pushes me away making me lay on the table and than puts his dick inside my pussy, without any protection! I shout, ""NOOO"" but he says ""Yess baby, The raw is where you can feel it."" And fuck he was right. I could feel his dick inside me getting more hard and pushing and thrusting me so deep. 

He said, ""You are working so hard baby. You deserve the reward"". I ask ""And what exactly are you offering me boss for being a slut for you?"". He says,"" If you become my manager I could fuck you everyday like a slut you are."" I say, ""yes sir and trust me I don't just work hard, I make things unforgettable.""  He says ""oh yeah?"" And we start kising and fucking till we both orgasm to it. 

He cum inside me shamelessly and says, 'if you are going to be my manager you will have to take my cum everyday slut"" and I reply ""Yes boss.  My pussy is where your cum belongs too"". That night was the best shameless night of my life I did to get the promotion.

I am a non-denominational Christian. For most of my life I was a lukewarm Christian, I went to Church with my family but I didn't live a Godly life. A couple months ago I felt the Lord calling on my heart to follow him and he has changed my life. I was baptized in early March, I've felt God change me as a person and I can't wait to see what he has prepared for me!

For a first date I'm good with getting coffee at some point in person. I love studying human biology and learning about how the body functions. It has made me appreciate how incredible life really is. A little bit about me is I love to watch movies, especially oldies. I'm 6'0"" and have a slender frame, I also have brown hair and blue eyes. 😉 My favorite film of all time is ""It's a Wonderful Life"", I watch it every year. I go jogging all the time out in the corn fields. Occasionally, I play video games like Minecraft and The Sims. I'd love to have game nights or movie nights, or best of all, both!

When God saved me, I realized my calling was to pursue a career in the medical field. I have given my life to Jesus Christ. I want to get to a point where I read the Bible every day and think about what God wants of me before I act. I'm looking for someone who wants to build a relationship through Jesus. I want someone who loves to spend time in the word. I'm up for someone between the ages of 18 and 26, and I hope to have children one day!

When it comes to a long-distance relationship, I wouldn't be able to wait for several years before living near each other. I'd need someone currently living in Iowa or in a nearby close state. Alternatively, if you are at a point where you'd be willing to move after a year or longer of dating, I'd love to get to know you. I'd really like to be able to relocate myself however I'm unable to while pursuing my career due to the cost associated and the programs located in my home state. I'm not comfortable dating someone who lives outside of the United States, sorry. Feel free to send me a message, and God bless!",1,1743255295.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

For some context:

Right now, I'm in my third year of a physics degree and I'm thinking of applying for a master or PhD outside. Where I live (LATAM), there aren't many opportunities to research and participate in research groups, since physics isn't very relevant here in my country. We don't even have a dedicated physics lab at my university, so it's somewhat difficult to gain research experience.

The thing is, a call was put out to go to another country with a project on the study of a highly acclaimed type of coffee produced here. Several professors are participating, and they've included physics students for the spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and other aspects. I decided to participate because it was a chance to gain experience as a researcher, but what they didn't say is that the students who attend (if they win the call) must write a thesis on the subject they're going to research, or at least something related to it (so that the proposal carries more weight, for some reason). I honestly don't know yet if I want to write my thesis on that topic.

Lately I've been quite interested in materials physics, statistical and quantum physics for my thesis, which would be largely theoretical (topics in which I would like to continue with a master's or PhD), but I feel that if I do not participate in this I may miss out on a great opportunity, where I could travel to another country, obtain very good training in equipment and experimental techniques, etc.

I'm doing all this to develop skills, gain experience and hopefully publish something so I can maximize my chances for an acceptance when I apply for a graduate degree.

Any advice on this is appreciated.",1,1743254857.0,gradadmissions,0,1.0,False

Above and beyond all, fear of change is arguably the biggest hurdle to changing the mindset of our society. 

In general, humans are naturally averse to change. How we think is how we are likely raised. We always think that just because everybody else does this, we believe it's the right thing. Routines are also established from repetition. A change of routine can be difficult to process. It's just retiring for example or changing a job you've worked for 20 years. It's always met with skepticism. 

--------------

Let's suppose the city magically built complete safe streets with EU-quality protected bike lanes and intersections on every major road in Toronto alongside greatly improved transit quality both locally and regionally. Also change zoning laws so more distances are walkable. Now that is r/FuckCars fever dream. While we're at it, let's do the same for the non-downtown portion of Toronto. Maybe even the denser suburbs like Brampton or Mississauga. Is an everyday driving commuter going to suddenly change their options? 

No. Their life is built around a car and they've invested almost all their time and energy around their automobile. You can look at [sunk cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost) fallacy. They have dedicated their entire life planning trips around traffic volume, parking availability, and gas prices. A North American [study](https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1230-march-21-2022-more-half-all-daily-trips-were-less-three-miles-2021) found that 50% of the trips done by a car are less than 5 km long. Another [study](https://www.autoinsurance.com/research/us-commuting-statistics/) found that average commute lengths are 26 minutes. This means that if you remove commutes, a significantly higher portion of the trips by cars are very short. In other words, even for trips that are suited for non-driving, they drive anyways. To suddenly change their way of transportation can feel like feeding Squidward a Krabby Patty. No wonder the term carbrain had to be coined. 

[Induced demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand) doesn't happen immediately. When you build an extra lane, new drivers don't instantly spawn. Same goes with in reverse. Drivers don't suddenly decide to bike their trips. People take time to adapt. That's why judging the success of a bike lane by how many people use them in the first 3 months is counterproductive. That's like trying to open up a coffee shop and expecting customers right away. The fact that there are even new cyclists and travel times were *marginally* increased is already a success, especially when there are hardly any North-South connections to Bloor and it only runs an additional ~5 km. 

What about business owners in walkable areas? It's not like most customers drive 20 km away just to visit. Those businesses don't sell large heavy items either. There's a lot of foot traffic. I remember visiting Bloor West a few times and mistakenly thought it was downtown because of its walkability design. So why are they so concerned? Because they never saw bike lanes outside their stores before. They are concerned about traffic congestion more than sales potential of non-driving trips. A lot of owners never really kept track of how many customers biked so they collectively agree that [utility cycling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_cycling) is nonexistent. Introducing bike lanes is like introducing a new mode of transportation. Bike parking is also very minimal even after implementation, which further reinforces the skepticism of bike infrastructure. They also believe that more car lanes result in faster deliveries. On the other hand, next to nobody was taught that safer streets invites more foot traffic to visit stores. This is such a foreign concept. I highly doubt they read actual [studies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-08/for-store-owners-bike-lanes-boost-the-bottom-line) that suggested de-prioritizing cars promoted more sales because from a marketing standpoint, this was never shown. At first, I thought they think good businesses should replicate a strip mall. However, I'm confident if they opened the store in an area with such little parking on a good day (20 cars per block lol), they would've made the calculated decision to prioritize local foot traffic. 

Look at Montreal bike lanes [revolt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlLyS8x1gZo). While we're both in Canada, it's a way more bike-friendly than Toronto. Guess what area they're debating at? A side street full of kids and with very little car traffic to begin with. Why are they so irrational? It makes no sense. Every opposition can all agree on one thing; They don't like those bike lanes. But they also can't provide a reasonable excuse or alternative solution. The YouTuber theorized this is due to fear of change.

What about non-drivers themselves? If there is so much sidewalk biking, why don't more pedestrians wish bike-only areas so to decrease their chances of encountering a cyclist? Why do they think bike lanes make cyclists more aggressive? Or why do they care so much about traffic? Because we've been taught that roads with no bike lane configurations are the 'normal' design. This video from [Vox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs7jHvh7v-4) explains it. We've been very oblivious to the dangerous nature of stroads and think simple design = good design. In fact, I doubt the average Joe even knows what a stroad actually means. Bike lanes tend to complicate configurations though for the improved safety of all road users. 

Bikes have always been stereotyped for causing chaos. Sidewalk biking has always been disliked. It was rarely talked about because overall cycling numbers were very low. Do you see Scarborough complain about sidewalk biking despite being a lot more common? No. However, Uber Eats has exploded in recent years. As a result, you're seeing more unpredictable and speedy cyclists. Even bike riders who use their bikes for personal use have also caused minor chaos on roads. Some newcomers are unfamiliar with predictability norms (ie. BikeShare or e-scooters). Even Canadians that previously biked sidewalks as kids have pedestrianized cycling. In other words, they would ride on bike lanes (where applicable) but cross a red light or stop sign like a pedestrian. This is known as the [Idaho stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho_stop). Then you have others who weave in and out of traffic. Now this paragraph isn't intended to dunk on cyclists or shame on bad apples. How does this relate to fear of change? Because they fear that if new bike lanes will spawn new cyclists, the streets/sidewalks would be chaotic, which is can be a bit of an annoyance. If anything, bike usage is growing, with or without bike infrastructure. Only difference is with better quality bike infrastructure, you'll see a higher obedience rates in predictability and traffic laws, as shown by various [studies](https://reddit.com/r/torontobiking/comments/14ufiz1/is_there_a_statistic_that_shows_how_often/jr83emw/).

How about cyclists themselves, particularly the utility cyclists? Well, they've been taught that personal safety = personal responsibility. Many cyclists have accepted that biking is dangerous and they've signed up for the risk of getting hit by cars. They've also developed the defensive bike riding strategy where it relies heavily on predictability. There's even a lot of frowning against non-helmet wearers, which is rarely discussed in the Netherlands. In fact, the [2019 Toronto Cycling survey](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/8f76-2019-Cycling-Public-Option-Survey-City-of-Toronto-Cycling.pdf) ranks bike education with high importance. Victim blaming culture is extremely prevalent where investigating the liable party is prioritized rather than the design safety of a road. A lot of people fear that prioritizing road design would remove the fault rating system. I've heard lots of comments calling me 'dismissive' of bad drivers just because I mention the importance of road design. Bike lanes greatly reduce the need for personal responsibility. It's similar to ADAS when it comes to driving where the auto-brake system significantly reduces crashes. However, it has its flaws, mainly right hooks, as new cyclists on bike lanes may feel a false sense of safety. Many old time utility cyclists have looked all directions for cars. They fear that this removes the need to check surroundings. As a whole, catering towards cyclists changes the general mindset about personal safety being linked to personal responsibility. 

For many years, our leaders have been afraid of building bike infrastructure on a grand scale. While times are changing as pro-bike Toronto leaders are more popular than ever, there's still a long way to go. Even without Doug Ford's intervention, bike lanes always require 1-2+ years of consultation, then get built with the lowest quality, and only upgraded IF there's enough advocacy/ridership. Many bike lane projects have been delayed over the years. In fact, Toronto only promised [500 km](https://reddit.com/r/torontobiking/comments/1dowtcg/toronto_gears_up_to_expand_its_bike_lane_network/lad4v3z/?context=3) of bike infrastructure by 2041. It took a pandemic to finally start building bike lanes in bunches and even then, it's mostly gutters, sharrows, or paint. Why do a lot of bike lanes have stubs that just end randomly with no perpendicular connections? Instead, why not build bike lanes with permanence just like sidewalks? Because leaders are too afraid of how the public will react. The Bloor West NIMBY outage was a perfect example. It was one of the longest extensions we've built in recent memory, not to mention with far better protection than the average new bike lane. That's why the mindset of commoners is so important to advocating road safety; in fact more than the leaders themselves. If more people supported bike infrastructure, our leaders would do the same as it increases the odds of staying in power. Unfortunately, for the most part, politicians are afraid of NIMBY's fear of change.

You know what's the worst part? Surprisingly, a lot of people appreciate European city designs yet return home and fight against it. This YouTube [comment](https://i.redd.it/846t78d1niqe1.png) sums it up perfectly. Unfortunately, they believe North America can never turn it around because the damage is irreversible. People from NA travel to EU all the time. You'd think that after multiple generations coupled with the rise of 15 min cities on social media, more people would finally take the *orange pill* right? Nope. Look at Bloor West. It was a step in the right direction towards proper road design, yet was met with a ton of controversy. Maybe that's why Toronto will never be like Dutch. Whenever we take 1 step forward, we sometimes end up taking 2 steps back (ie Doug Ford's bill 212). These NIMBYs know EU does it a lot better YET continue to defend bad designs and support politicians like Ford.

My guess would be that carbrains are afraid that it'll force everybody out of cars and transit (or bikes). We've been raised to cater towards visiting suburban commuters rather than locals. Yes, I've heard comments from even downtown residents that believe car access from Burlington is more important than road safety. There's very little on-street parking in EU downtowns compared to NA downtowns. Even in non-bike lane discussions, reduced on-street parking was rarely mentioned. They fear that removing them hurts economical growth because they are ingrained to the idea where suburban visitors are rich. This may also be the logic behind businesses owners' need for parking. In reality, suburban commuters spend a lot on maintaining a car and downtown has a walkability premium where only rich people can afford to live. To be fair, they're somewhat correct because EU is less friendly to drivers, though we all know who is the biggest enemy to drivers; other drivers. Netherlands is [ironically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8RRE2rDw4k) a good country to drive on. Montreal and New York are a lot closer to following EU standards yet mentioning them is always met with the excuse 'we're just different'. This implies that Toronto (GTA mainly) wants to follow American suburb norms and practices. 

--------

With all that being said, I think almost every piece of mental gymnastics thrown at us is due to the fear of change. It's frustrating to read but that's how people think. This explains why we're stuck in this car dependent mess. As a whole, I believe that if our society is more open-minded and sees the importance of road safety, rather than prioritize the speed of traffic, we can definitely change. Road safety and bike lanes are a new concept to the North American society so it'll take time for more people to get on board. However, advocacy is stronger than ever before so maybe in 10 years, we'll see people change.

1jmm3kb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoon/comments/1jmm3kb/kendu_how_kendu_is_gonna_capture_retail_investors/,Kendu - How Kendu is Gonna Capture Retail Investors,"**Kendu Overview**

Kendu is a completely organic memecoin that is on Ethereum, Solana and BASE. We are entirely focused on community and have nearly 18k holders. Whilst I am positive you have seen Kendu either on Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, Coin Market Cap, Instagram or wherever else, I will still give a quick overview.  
Kendu is over a year old with an ATH of 283 million, Kendu has went through several redistribution periods and at the time of writing has had 7 green days in a row.  
Kendu is following the same path that Pepe, Shib and Doge created back when they ran to the billions. This process typically takes longer than a KOL based memecoin, but it has a much higher potential for returns.  
Kendu has many IRL products and Events and they are very important for a memecoin, as it is very attractive for potential holders. Kendu's IRL output is a testament to its strength, the fact that the community has managed this before Kendu has reached the billions, is nothing short of a miracle.  
It is plain to see where Kendu is going, we are destined for the billions.  
Kendu has reached 50k votes to earn a free Certik audit, the only other coin to ever do this was Pepe...  
This Certik Audit gave us an A rating, which is very good!!!

Kendu has multiple international communities incase English is not your first language:🇮🇳 India,🇪🇸 Spanish,🇦🇪 Arabic, 🇫🇷 French, 🇩🇪 German, 🇵🇹 Portuguese, 🇷🇺 Russian, 🇨🇳 Chinese, 🇯🇵 Japanese, 🇮🇩 Indonesian, 🇰🇷 Korean, 🇹🇭 Thai, 🇹🇷 Turkish, 🇿🇦 Zulu.

**IRL Products and Event**

Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu Creator, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.  
Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami  
Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.

From India to Miami. Kendu is truly global

**Miami Music Week**

Miami Music Week is kicking off and Kendu is a head sponsor of this. This is absolutely massive as around 165,000 people are expected to go. StaySeaArt, NoSleep305 and Inkstradamus are leading the charge in the Miami heat :)  
Kendu Energy, Kendu Merch and cocktails made from Kendu Energy will be given out to the attendees of this event. This is a great opportunity for Kendu and to go in with a green chart, the sky is the limit!!!  
NoSleep305 were behind the iconic Kendu Mural in Miami and Inkstradamus are making the Kendu Merch. Whilst StaySeaArt designed the Kendu Cocktail Menu. They will go down in Kendu history.

**Kendu Creator**

Kendu Creator is a website created by a chad called Akabe, where you can 3d print a Kendu mask. Whilst wearing this mask, you can play drums(like Akabe), lift weights, dance, sing.... the list goes on. This is a project to get Kendu on all forms and areas of social media, this is gonna be great, soon people will be seeing drums, people singing and running all wearing a Kendu mask. This is truly a revolutionary idea and it could make Kendu viral. We also have the Akabe mask as a filter on TikTok, so you can create a TikTok video without actually printing the mask. This gives access to the Akabe mask to everyone.  
Akabe has mentioned the discipline that Kendu creator has brought to his life, Kendu creator has gave him a lot of discipline to practice to drums daily to improve the content he can make. Akabe says Kendu creator gives people purpose and it pushes people to become a better version of themselves whilst pushing Kendu to the top. This is wonderful and it shows the Ken-Du mentality.

I cannot stress this enough, this is one of the best ideas that has came out of Kendu so far!!!

**What to look for in a Memecoin and why Kendu has that**

A community is what gives memecoins value and Kendu has arguably the best community in crypto, if Shib, Doge and Pepe can accomplish the billions with far less money in the market, why can't Kendu. We are at the base of the biggest AltSeason in Crypto history, we truly have the potential to 1000x and in my opinion we can 3000x. Shib went from 22 million to 22 billion in 36 days, so why can't Kendu? It has already been proven that community is all you need by the 3 coins I have mentioned, so what's stopping Kendu???  
Join the Telegram and check out the community even if you are not a holder. We would love to have you.  
Skip the Frappuccino and put the money into Kendu at the minimum. This is not an opportunity you want to miss.  
All the signs were there...

I want to sincerely wish everyone good luck for the bull run, no matter whether you are in Kendu or not :)

1jmm3bh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/comments/1jmm3bh/the_subreddit_has_become_insufferable/,The subreddit has become insufferable,"I recognize this is just a subreddit about a streamer. It makes sense that the streamer’s interests and activity get reflected in the subreddit. And let’s face it, Asmon has gotten uber political over the last year or so. Couple that with the “content president” and politics is the perpetual gift that keeps on giving, so to speak.

But I’ve also noticed a growing trend of distaste for the political overload, particularly when someone shares a shit political meme (conservative or liberal; it doesn’t matter)

Lastly there’s an interesting ebb and flow where this subreddit is basically /r/conservative 2.0 and you can’t make any comments not completely agreeing with Trump, Vance, or Musk. The flipside is realtime reactions to this administration’s blunders such as Trump talking shit about the author of our trade agreement with Canada and Mexico (it was him) and remarking about how anyone could sign an agreement like that. More recently was the Signal blunder where we simultaneously get to see Trump’s cabinet squirm and lie to Congress (without consequences of course) and at the same time the democrats are gonna fuck this up any day now.

All that said, I’m not just here to whine; I bring a suggestion. I believe a nice fix to this issue that makes everyone happy is either one day per week or one week per month gets designated as “no politics” (say, every Tuesday or the second week of every month) and that gives us a guaranteed regular breather from all the political posts, while still allowing for whatever the majority of the time.

You may think your life has no influence on others—but it does. There are people who will follow your example. If you are reverent, they will be reverent. If you are dishonest, they will be dishonest. Your influence touches many lives, leaving either a blessing or a curse.

One man shared his story of coming to Christ: “If I had been going to hell alone,” he said, “I would have kept going. But one night, I came home from drinking, and I looked at my sleeping children. I held a lamp over their faces, and in the silence, I saw a terrifying vision of myself descending into hell with my innocent children clinging to my garments. I couldn’t bear it. I could ruin myself, but I couldn’t drag them down with me. Right there beside their bed, I knelt and asked God to save me, for their sake.”

There were a lot of foreigners present and it was a pleasant environment.

A person from Australia approached me to ask about some general info and then we proceeded to have a small chat. He said to me that this is his 3rd time visiting Pune specifically with his business partner from Germany(his 2nd time). They were looking to invest in some companies and meet with some clients they already had.

I asked them about what they felt about the city and I was surprised to hear what they said.
He said that 6-8 yrs back when he visited Pune for the first time, it wasn't as developed as today, but the people were extremely nice and helpful. But, this time particularly he's seen many goons, chapris(he described them) and overall vibe shift as compared to the previous time. He had to encounter goons on the road 2-3 times just within the past week that he's been here. He felt unsafe for the first time in Pune. He also said that the his partner from Germany had a similar experience.

It's very sad and preposterous that we've become such a distopian vibes city. And the government is doing nothing to change it. The investments from foreign investors are also at risk if they feel that people can't even have an opinion and there's no ease of doing business here.

So I decided to just eat Whole Foods and go from there. Then I discovered a method of eating and fasting for your menstrual cycle. I do Keto and extended water fasts during my period and follicular phase up until ovulation. During ovulation I eat 100-150g carbs and don’t fast over 15 hours. After ovulation window I cut the carbs again and intermittent fast but make sure I’m getting enough fat to make good cholesterol for progesterone support. Then during luteal phase a week before period I eat 100-150g of carbs daily and eat as soon as I wake up, usually eggs and spinach and fruit. Lots of sweet potatoes, spinach, broccoli, heavy on the beef and salmon, eggs, bacon, real butter, cheese, lots of almonds and nuts, cinnamon, salt, bananas, apples, strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, red bell peppers, avocados, bitter teas, still coffee almost every morning with monk fruit and heavy cream.

Yes I gained a little weight back because I went over on carbs accidentally a few times, but I have not had the urge to pull eating this way. 

So try eating and fasting for your cycle. I made the connection between hair pulling and progesterone because it flares up that week of cycle and I didn’t make enough progesterone with both of my pregnancies so had complications. I also took methylated b vitamins a few times this month when I got the urges and they went away WITH food. Apparently your ovaries use glucose to function (still iffy on that cause of what I’ve learned from carnivore community) and progesterone needs cholesterol. This is the result though… first month of no pulling urges since I went through puberty. I’ll give it a few months and then I will try carnivore diet again and see if it comes back. I’m so happy right now and my hot spots look great. 

One more thing… I alternate washing body and hair with ACV or baking soda and salt. Baking soda, salt, coconut oil deodorant. Brush teeth with baking soda and added minerals. I use coconut oil for lotion and a little for conditioner. Essential oils sometimes (blueberry oil and vanilla usually) My scalp feels good.

I'm absolutely confused,"Hello everyone. This may be quite long, sorry in advance, but the whole situation is making me confused and stupid. (Considering my last experience, I was denied a couple of times by the ones I liked. I do consider myself beautiful and interesting to an adequate degree, I have friends and a good family, socially alright).

So, for context, we're in Europe, both foreigners living in a student dormitory. We firstly met at the beginning of the winter semester last year when I was moving in, and my parents were helping me. He opened the door for me. I didn't even recall this anymore, just thought in the moment that he looked interesting. Then we met at the beginning of this semester on an event. He was in the distance and I was attracted like a magnet to him. I couldn't even see his face properly, and didn't recognise him as that person who opened the door. We met at another event later and he was the one who recalled it. I was feeling that he may be kinda uncomfortable with our age gap, but this is still only my assumption. I followed him on Instagram, he followed back. Then I was wandering if I should text first, while I was with a friend in university having this exact thought, I saw him running late for a class. I decided to try, we talked a little and then he invited me for a coffee. I really enjoyed our time together, we share a lot of interests and I just genuinely enjoyed his presence. Maybe my mind was too foggy to mention that he perhaps wasn't on the same note, but I felt like he at least liked the time spend together. Then we parted, we casually hugged and he said ""see you soon"". Maybe it was just politeness from him, but I did get it as ""see you next week"". He is busy with finishing studies and working, I know. Anyways, he didn't text me back in a couple of days and I again decited to text first. He was responding quite randomly, but not short or cold. Like either in a couple of hours, in 10 minutes, a day, and now he didn't respond back, however didn't read(open) the messages.

During the week, my stupid mind remembered that he mentioned liking cookies. Did I ever bake something in my life? No. Did I bake cookies for him? Freaking yes, a friend tasted and said they're amazing. One problem, he didn't text me back or invited to a second date. Now I'm wandering if I should text him first again.

I don't know if this makes sense to add, but he is Latino and has a large community of friends, including lots of girls. However, he doesn't seem hot and macho by temper, I'd say even vice versa. I also have a lot of male friends, so this doesn't bother me.

I was thinking just to text him and ask to meet for 5 minutes, give him the cookies (I don't even eat them), and try to ask subtly or directly if he is interested in meeting again.

I'm sorry for the long novel, but I'm afraid I don't have a properly working brain now, and at the same time don't want to lose him. ",1,1743253668.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

Fuel Your Body, Shed the Weight, Stay Strong

Why This Meal Plan?

As a busy dad, you don't have time to measure every calorie or cook elaborate meals. You need quick, high-protein, energy-packed meals that keep you lean, strong, and fueled for the day. This plan is designed for simplicity, efficiency, and results-no fluff, just real food that works. Plus, everything is kid-friendly, so you're not making separate meals for the family.

I cook for a family of 5 and as a dad with a wife that stays at home, I am fortunate enough to focus more so on my personal diet than for the whole family. I do however cook dinners with not only my family in mind, but tomorrows lunch as well.
Check out the following meal structure I generally follow on a daily basis, below




The Rugged Dad Nutrition Rules:

Protein First - Every meal should have at least 30g of protein to build muscle and burn fat.

Whole Foods Over Processed Junk - If it comes in a box with 20 ingredients, skip it.

Eat Like a Caveman - meats, eggs, nuts, fruits,
and veggies.

Drink Water Like a Beast - At least 100 oz a day
(ditch the soda & energy drinks).

Keep It Simple Stupid- No complicated recipes.
Fast, effective, and dad-proof.




5-Minute Meals to Get Lean & Strong:

Breakfast: High-Protein Overnight Oats (Grab
& Go
• 1/2 cup oats
• 1 scoop protein powder
• 1 tbsp peanut butter
• 1/2 banana (sliced)
• 1 cup milk
• Mix in a jar the night before and grab it in the morning.

Lunch: Last Night's Leftovers
• No extra prep required. Save a portion from dinner and reheat. (I have a family of 5 but portion for a family of 6 when I cook dinner)
• Example: Oven baked chicken, mashed sweet potatoes, and steamed broccoli.

Snack: Grab-and-Go Fuel
• 1 cheese stick + handful of nuts. (I like pecans, pumpkin seeds and walnuts)
• Greek yogurt + berries (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries etc...)
• Hard-boiled eggs (prepped in bulk)

Dinner: Rugged Dad Power Plate (family friendly)
• 1 oven baked chicken breast, steak, or salmon filet.
• 1 cup mashed sweet potatoes or rice
• 1 cup steamed broccoli or mixed vegetables.
(My kids love their mixed vegetables coated lightly in organic butter, salt, pepper and onion powder)




Bonus: Rugged Dad Rules for Fat Loss & Energy

Intermittent Fasting (Optional): Skip breakfast 2-3 days a week and push your first meal to noon.
• Strength Training: Lift heavy 3-4x a week— focus on compound exercises and

Outdoor Cardio: Walking, hiking, biking, rucking, sprinting-ditch the treadmill, move like a man.

No Liquid Calories: Coffee, tea, water—no sugary drinks.




What's Next?

This is just the start. Follow The Rugged Dad Project for more meal plans, workouts, and no-BS fitness strategies. Let's build a stronger, leaner, and more badass version of you-one meal at a time.

Wondering if anyone has ideas how we can make some adjustment to iDrive;

* Can we disable the tunnel & rest stop/coffee-cup indication on the main driver i.e. 'instrument' display? Dont need to know about tunnels or stops, especially those I pass frequently. On roadtrip I could perhaps consider to enable it, probably wouldnt as my eyes will tell me when either one is coming up.
* Same goes for the cluttering of map with charge-locations. I dont need to know all chargers around me at all times. Only perhaps at when actively looking for location, or at lower SoC. Can we select POIs somewhere?
* Roaming with eSIM (via BMW preferred partner Ubigi) doesnt reliably work abroad, even with full European subscription. Anyway to reset the modem or does the 'service mode reset' also reboot connectivity?
* Side-camera-detection parking is quite sensitive, and often late. Sometimes it starts screaming for invisible curbs, or detects lines as curbs. I'm getting somewhat used to the emergency-braking and am mostly appreciative (rather than other way round). However sometimes the perceived obstacle (e.g. leaves, line or cyclist/pedestrian) is already long gone and it'll stay 'stuck' in emergency. I can 'override' the e-brake by carefully throttling through, or go into P and back into R, was wondering if there's a better way to disengage e-brake mode?

Thanks for your help, also from the many other posts and replies. Looking forward to many more comfortable kilometers!

1jmlr03,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advicePH/comments/1jmlr03/yesterday_my_22m_gf_24f_asked_for_space_this/,Yesterday my [22M] gf [24F] asked for space. This doesn’t sound like her and forces me to believe that by agreeing I’m signing the death warrant to our relationship.,"I’ll try to keep it short as I can but I want to give as much detail so I can have proper feedback. I (22M) and my gf (24F) have been together for 1 year. (USA) It’s been poetic to say the least, from both sides. She is lovely, very kind and compassionate, very loving to myself and my son. Gets along swimmingly with my family and hers with me as well. We have never yelled at each other, we are wonderful communicators and always solve the problems together. I can confidently say up until recent we had no true issues. 

About 4 weeks ago, I found out an incident that had happened with a coworker of ours that happened much before we had met. Maybe 2 years ago, give or take (Just to clarify, they never slept together, only 1 date and he pursued her for about a year after, while getting a divorce). While it’s not a huge deal to me and Im not one to judge anyone’s past, I had specifically asked upwards of 7-8 times if anything had ever happened concerning this specific coworker. I didn’t care or feel threatened but ever since he found out her and I were together his attitude towards me did a complete 180. We went from friendly and talkative.. to short, pointed and very odd remarks about my gf. 

This threw me off an I had specifically asked about this behavior and if there is anyway she could help me understand the sudden change. She never alluded to this issue and was adamant that nothing ever happened. From that point I had dropped it and just moved on. Well turns out other people had their suspicions of something that had happened and finally I pressed her a little further as my gut was telling me that wasn’t the full truth. It turns out that all it was and like I said I couldn’t care less, but it really dampened the trust I had built in her. 

I decided to break it off then (2nd time) and let sleeping dogs lie. Up until this point I have never had anxiety attacks or knots outside of drinking too much coffee. But that night I felt sick, like I had taken it too far and that I was seriously walking away from something that is repairable. I sat in it and didn’t reach out. I had asked for space and time alone. She pursued me unwaveringly for 3-4 days and even broke down at work multiple times because of it. Finally she met me after work 4 weekends ago (roughly 4-5 days after this event) and gives me a very long letter. In this letter I was blown away by  everything she thought. She held nothing back and never did anything but admit wrong doing and never made an excuse for her actions. 

On top of me truly believing to my core that I had made a mistake and praying about it, I decided to slowly take steps to reconciliation. Everything was great, she kept true to all her commitment and promises and truly opened up more about everything I could possibly find out or that may hurt me in the future (nothing I didn’t already know). This lasted and was great but everyday I was questioning her silently, I wouldn’t say anything specific but started to question her actions more. Other than I slowly realized I still didn’t fully trust her. I didn’t fully believe everything she said and always felt like I was looking and searching for an out or to be right. I broke things off with her again, this time over text as to try and avoid a face to face conversation. She came over and I let her in and we talked, we loved and we decided to keep going and that I was again over reacting. Once she left I immediately went down a spiral and broke it off 2 days later (last night) after we agreed to spend Friday with each other and head into work Saturday from my home. 

Once I sent the text, I was very polite but to the point that my lack of trust in her was wavering and that I didn’t think I could do this with her but I still did very much love her. About 35 minutes later she started to frantically call me and asked to come in and that she was at my house. I let her in and we were very quiet for a while until the silence grew painful. She asked and begged me to ‘jump’ for her and to let her show me that everything she said was true and pure. While I truly love her I was hesitant to take that huge leap of faith after I already had and it had been broken. After a few hours of very respectful talking and communication, we agreed that we would jump together. I agreed not to attempt to leave again just because I’m still hurting and she agreed to be transparent and honest and help rebuild. She then spent the night and planned to go home in the morning, pack a bag and continue our original plans. This would have taken a total of 2 hours max. 

We talked on her drive home via phone call but when she got home she went AWOL, 3 hours of radio silence. Then sends me a very shocking text that she’s very in love with me and that she loves us but doesn’t like the cycle of rinse and repeat we seem to be starting. I ask to meet and she agrees, it turns out when she made it home her sister and best friend sat her down and told her that they are concerned because of her frantic and late departure three times to my home in the past month to make sure we didn’t split up. 

When we saw each other she explained that she needed space and that she wanted to be able to breathe and that she feels as if she’s begging me to love and trust her. We have polar opposite responses to this specific issue, hers being to cling tighter and mine being to walk away fairly quickly and without warning. I understand that I’ve also made the mistake of giving her no reason to trust that I won’t walk away again. After promising the multiple times I won’t, and then doing it abruptly twice over text within a week span, then agreeing again that I’d take that leap of faith with her once more.

The part I need advice on:

She asked for space, she used ‘break’ and ‘space’ interchangeably but clarified it wasn’t a break or to break up but just space from each other for a bit. We kept our locations on, we set ground rules to stay exclusive and trust that our loyalty will not waver in the time being. She agreed we will keep up some sense of normalcy, such as being somewhat normal at work, occasional texting and checking in and maybe spending a few hours a week at lunch or sitting in the car after work. She wasn’t very specific on a timeframe but did say she thinks it’s best we take anywhere from 2-8 weeks to both determine our best relationship-repair tools and if what we truly want is each other and to put an end to this cycle. I agreed, not very willingly, and have again turned into a ball of anxiety once again. She’s never given me a reason to doubt her loyalty, only her trust in this isolated event. But asked that for at least the first 48 hours refrain from texting and both just relax and breathe. 

In my mind I don’t necessarily see this as super healthy, as communication in solving the issue together is the common goal, not ignoring the problem and each other. I also think we both have cracks in the foundation of trust for different reasons that this break may not fix.

Am I wrong in believing that we maybe signing the relationships death warrant?


I also at least plan on waiting until first contact to communicate to her. Although I thought that similarly writing a letter conveying all my thoughts, feelings and strategies would be optimal so that she understands this is not one sided and that I want this at bad as she does and that I understand I was wrong in my actions and words.

Does this sound like a poor idea?
Is giving her the same opportunity she gave me, to read her heart, fair to her?


I did at one point ask for space after the initial break up and that was the 3-4 days I mentioned earlier, to which she sadly agreed to. When I received the letter, it touched me in a way I cannot describe. I reinitiated contact and brought some normalcy back into our lives. I’ve asked her for space before and she’s given it to me. All be it begrudgingly, still messaging me sweet texts and sending me TikTok’s. Although we’ve never not gone more than 3-4 days not seeing each other (either at work or spending time together) or radio silence for over 48 hours.

Should I wait out the silence and give her the space she wants? 
Should I make one last stand and effort to form healthy repair strategies with her and keep moving forward?
Should I quietly or verbally let this relationship go? 


To reiterate, even now I would never doubt the love and choice of daily love we have for each other. She was very emotional asking for time and seemed to be hurting bad when starting the conversation but also seemed extremely optimistic that this was going to be good for us. That is proving to each other: (1) I can trust her word and (2) she can trust my commitment, that we will flourish. She also agreed with my sentiment that this wasn’t enough to fix the issue but merely a start. But I do have a slight feeling that while her emotions were all genuine, the ‘fix’ or ‘solution’ to our cycle was regurgitated and not actually her own personal solution. It seemed very against our entire relationship up until this point and the way we have always solved our issues. I also felt very strongly that this maybe a way for us to be pulled apart from the seam and all the time and effort we’ve put into this, throw away.

I.e. a coffee button, a lunch mealdeal button, a work lunch button, which have associated costs that add to the list on the day that you press them and summarise your spending throughout the day and week. Showing how much you have leftover. 

It would be great to also have a custom button at the top where you can enter how much you’ve spent and the category of it so that it can be added to the list.

This time my a1c was 6.7, so he has started me on Metformin, 500mg. I took one dose yesterday with breakfast, as instructed. I was fine most of the day until about 3 pm, the bathroom run started. The rest of the night, I had a stomachache and some bloating. It wasn’t unbearable, but very much there. Eventually, it tapered off and I was fine. Woke up this morning, no meds food or coffee yet, and the stomach started up again.  

I have read all the horror stories as well as the good, so I understand it’s a person by person thing. I have IBS in general, so I was always reluctant about getting on this but since the numbers are now showing diabetic, I have to take it seriously.  My questions are at what point should I say I can’t tolerate it? Am I being a baby if I don’t want to wait it out? Having IBS, I’ve had way too many close calls and incidents in my lifetime that I don’t want to play with this. Also, my IBS has been controlled way better lately with just adding 2 Citrucil most days. Now I feel like going backwards with unpredictable bathroom Issues.  

I’m going to ask the doc to switch to the extended released as I understand that may be a little easier. Should I continue taking what I have until I talk with him Monday? I’ve only had one dose so far. ",1,1743252820.0,diabetes,1,1.0,False

* 109 principle, 11k interest (74k graduate plus loans at 9% interest and 44k unsubsidized at 8% interest)

* Basically 0 savings
* Graduate in August as a psychiatric nurse practitioner
* Can live at home for as long as I need (although would prefer no more than 6 months). Would like to move to a city 30 mins away eventually. Willing to defer for short period.
* Pay back begins 6 months after graduation
* Standard plan would put me at $800/mo
* SAVE would be like $400/mo but I know the federal court stopped this.
* I’m 30 years old, will be 31 when I graduate. Something to keep in mind for lifestyle. Single, no children, only child and father is 73. Buying a home is less important to me right now than paying the debt down. Don’t feel like I need it 100% immediately but under 50k would be ideal.
* My dad has offered to sell one of the homes he owns to wipe out most of the debt but he earns passive income from this and I don’t want him to lose that so I told him no thank you. His assets are about 1 million and he still works/gets social security - brings home about 90k a year.
* Not super interested in counting on the 10 year forgiveness plan because 1) not sure what will happen with loan forgiveness in general and 2) not totally sure I will maintain employment at public entities for the next 10 years.
* I live frugally, never eating out, clothes from thrift stores, make coffee at home, don’t dye my hair/manicures etc. Things that I look forward to one day!



Job options:

* (Although I’ll be a new grad PMHNP on paper, I have 8 years of experience doing therapy (LCSW) and was a site director of a private practice. So I bring some experience for what it’s worth! )

* Fellowship for 82k gross income for 9 months (could make an extra 2k gross per month doing telehealth, which I am doing currently with my therapy license). Fellowship looks great on resume and really good supervision.
* Private practice making \~185k, 1-2 hours of supervision per week. Could attack the loans with this but would not be my ideal work environment. Open to it temporarily though.
* Something in between - approximately 115k in a hospital system. 1-2 hrs supervision per week. 
* 5+ years from now I’d like to be working part time private practice and part time in a hospital system, with the potential to make 200k+. My goal is not to go full time private cash pay and rake in as much as possible, but my biggest priority is variety. I love outpatient but I also want time doing other things - consult, supervision, research, teaching etc. (interested in DNP eventually - I love learning!).



I’m not in the market for career advice, just advice in the context of paying back loans. Safety and supervision are a priority to me, above money, and I have a team of psychiatrists, nurse practitioners, and professors who are guiding me and will ensure that I am always putting safety first. I’ve already been offered a job at a private practice with insufficient supervision and have turned it down. I fully recognize the “currency” of robust supervision, especially at first.



If other information is needed to answer this question I can provide!



**My biggest question is - would you attack or would you pay the minimum until making more?**



Please be nice, I’m not experienced in stuff like this and am genuinely looking for theories/advice. Answer as if you were giving advice to a loved family member. Thanks 🙂

1jmlmdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hashimotos/comments/1jmlmdr/why_isnt_anyone_talking_about_this_trigger/,Why isnt anyone talking about this trigger?,"Ive been battling symptoms since 2020, going back and forth to specialists.
In 2023 i was diagnosed with hashis, but at a very early stage. Antibodies 101 , tsh 5.25 .
Didnt start medication till July 2024 when symptoms got worse and tsh jumped to an 8 and antibodies 120.

Anyways,
For years I felt so sick. The fatigue was crushing. I mean in 2020 i was 24 years old. I couldnt get out of bed for the life of me. I was ALWAYS tired. I needed a mid day nap. I stopped socializing, stopped seeing family, I was just way too tired.
Another main symptom I had — heart palpitations. Id get these very random heart palpitations that would feel like fluttering like someone is stepping on my chest, it would come and go very randomly but now Ive realized its mostly before and during my period.

Other symptoms I had-
- Extremely fast weight gain and for no reason. 
- BAD mood swings. Emotional rollercoaster allll day
- itchy itchy dry skin
- sensitivity to cold and or heat.

Ive just always felt “sick” but even when starting medication I felt a little better but still felt stuck like in this zombie mode. I couldn’t figure it out. 
I checked online and on reddit and tried to cut gluten and dairy, that didnt work at all.
Regardless I eat a very minimal amount of processed food and I cook at home and eat whole foods.

Recently my marriage was at stake , my mood swings were so bad, I was so irritable, id pick fights all day long, I was always tired I needed to sleep I didnt want to go out.

I was just so frustrated that this was happening to me.

Recently ive become more in tune with my body and trying to find triggers and if something could be causing this.

One day it just hit me — coffee.

I decided to alot of research on coffee and realized how terrible it really is — especially for someone whos caffeine sensitive.

I said to myself, lets try matcha instead. I loved it, but at that point I hadnt given up coffee yet.
Still was not feeling better.

2 weeks ago, my husband bought me a bunch of decaf nespresso pods and said “try these”’instead of caffeinated .

And also to note - I only drank 1 cup of coffee a day, I know some people drink 5 + cups but not me lol.

Anyways, 2 weeks have gone by where I have not had any caffeinated coffee and WOW.
My life has CHANGED instantly. Like a whole 360.

I feel like a normal human being again, Ive actually cried.
No more mood swings, I am so calm now. No more racing heart or chest tightness all day long.
No more constant fight or flight mode.
My personality is slowly coming back, im so much happier smiling laughing again.
No more mid day naps.
And the best part of it all, I DONT FEEL HUNGRY ANYMORE!!! When drinking caffeinated coffee I always felt famished! Idk why!

But I felt like sharing this to help anyone who may be in the same position as me.

This is going to sound like a moan hopefully its not.   I am a keen coffee drinker, I don't drink loads in a day but I do enjoy a good cup and over the years have acquired and a developed a keen sense of coffee smell and taste and there is no denying the rich aroma of a coffee when it brews and fills the room made from fresh roasted beans.

But something has gone wrong with all of our coffee products on the high street and I noticed this problem about 10 months ago...first I noted odd taste between the same brand of espresso I pointed this out on Twitter with said company and noted how the two coffee grinds even looked and smelled different (one lighter shade).

Fast forward to today and I am convinced we are not drinking proper coffee anymore its all synthetic or some other plant based crap for starters why does the coffee have white specs in the grind now what are they and is this why all coffee has that medication after taste to it?  What happened to the richness of a coffee its not there anymore now when its up to temp a flavour is switched on and we assume its coffee we are drinking.

I am finding my alternative sources are now using the same coffee or using coffee that has been over processed or its not even legit coffee anymore.   All the brands taste the same, sort of a flour taste to the coffee bad guts followed by a bitterness in your mouth but ZERO caffeine and that's the kicker here none of the current brands bought from co-op, Tesco, Morrions etc have any caffeine in them like the fizzy drinks its all chemical delivery now.

I have sourced good quality beans and will be grinding them up later to brew a coffee (I have both the espresso kettle and traditional pan method) and that should hopefully give me the caffeine kick which seems to be missing from coffee right now...am I going made who else has noticed this?",0,1743252693.0,espresso,14,0.1,False

But after hearing about a natural supplement stack that supposedly boosts **energy, focus, and overall health**, I figured—why not? I needed something to help me through the long hours of work and training. Anything that would help manage stress would be great as well...A healthy body and mind is vital in business and finance. 

I tested it for 30 days with no changes to my diet or routine. Just slowly started taking the new natural supplements.

Here’s what happened:

🔥 **Energy Boos**t: No more mid-day crashes. I feel dialed in all day, even without coffee.  
🧠 **Mental Clarity & Focu**s: I can work for hours without distractions. It feels like my brain fog just disappeared.  
😴 **Better Sleep & Recover**y: I wake up refreshed, and my body feels way less inflamed.  
😃 **Mood & Motivatio**n: This one shocked me—I just feel **bett**er overall, way more motivated.

At first, I thought it was placebo, but by **week 2, the effects were undeniable**. And I’m not the only one—apparently, top-level athletes and entrepreneurs use this same stack.

I won’t pretend to be a scientist, but I’m curious—**has anyone else tried natural supplement stacks?** What’s worked for you?

If you’re interested, I put the exact stack I used here (affiliated): [**https://bluefounderacademy.com/stack**](https://bluefounderacademy.com/stack)

Is it flat vs conical? Upgrading the size of the burrs? Or choosing a more premium SSP style burr? Or something unique to the actual grinder like prebreaker or variable rpm? 

I suppose taste is rather vague too. But if you could describe the way that the change affected the coffee in the cup, beyond the realm of possible placebo, that would be amazing. 

(For context, I’m trying to decide whether upgrading from a DF64V stock burrs to a set of SSP MPs, or getting a Timemore 078s, or saving and getting a Lagom P100, would produce the greatest upgrade in cup quality. Currently, the espresso I make is delicious but very much the “hump” on the bell curve, and maybe muddy. I want to be able to really discern the separate flavor notes without muddiness, mainly because I am getting into coffee roasting and need to see exactly what flavor notes i end up with post-roast.

Here’s why Peter Dutton is done.,"I’ve been analysing the Dickson race from a neighbouring electorate and I’m calling it early. Peter Dutton is going to lose his seat. Not to Labor. To Independent Ellie Smith.

Here’s the situation:

Dutton’s primary vote is sinking. He won in 2022 with 43.7% and only had a 1.7% 2pp lead over Ali France who is recontesting. If he drops below 38%, he’s stuffed. That’s just maths.

Ellie Smith is running a proper Teal-style campaign. Full-time, strong ground game, huge launch turnout, corflutes everywhere, daily coffee greets. This isn’t a placeholder indie. She’s serious and under the radar.

She’s going to be pulling votes from across the board moderate Libs, soft Labor, Greens, protest votes, disengaged centrists. Exactly the same dynamic that flipped Warringah where Abbott lost 12% of his first preference vote.

Dutton’s not on the ground. He’s focused on national stuff. His local campaign is basically just billboards saying “Don’t risk Labor” which don’t work against a centrist Independent.

He also bailed to Sydney just before a cyclone hit his electorate. People noticed.

Smith isn’t issuing how-to-vote cards, so preferences will flow organically. That hurts Labor chances if she finishes third. If she overtakes France and makes the final two-candidate count against Dutton, she wins easily. If she doesn’t, her preferences still make France highly competitive.

This is Warringah all over again. Dutton doesn’t have the numbers or the narrative to hold on.

The models I've designed imply he can only win if Smith finishes third and her preferences flow to him and not Ali France. His local popularity is up for debate but with a gentrifying electorate and his recent poor optics I'm pegging him as in serious danger here.

If he finishes under 38% he can't win. If that happens and Smith finishes above 23% Smith will win, otherwise Labor will win.

Watch this space. Dickson itself is going to be the most interesting count imo.",53,1743250751.0,AusPol,32,0.94,False

1jmky4n,https://i.redd.it/14yadaijemre1.png,Introducing The Community Bower: A Chamber of Care for Local Nonprofits (Stark County Ohio),"Hey neighbors!

I wanted to share something I’ve been quietly building that I think might resonate with some of you doing community work in Stark County Ohio. It’s called The Community Bower—and it’s basically a Chamber of Commerce, but for grassroots leaders, nonprofit folks, mutual aid crews, and anyone doing the slow, steady work of community care.

We’re just getting started, but here’s what’s in the works:

- Monthly connection events

- A shared resource library for tools, templates, grant leads, and more

- Opportunities for peer support, cross-referrals, and collaboration

- A vibe that’s more “grab coffee and strategize” than “power lunch and pitch deck”


The goal is simple: to make it easier for small-but-mighty orgs and community leaders to find each other, share what’s working, and build stronger systems—together.

We’re currently piloting the Bower through a grassroots incubator called IncuBrighter, and we’d love to connect with folks who want to help shape it.

If you’re:

Running a small nonprofit

Organizing in your neighborhood

Doing mutual aid or advocacy work

Dreaming up a project that doesn’t quite “fit” traditional org models...


You belong here.

Drop a comment if you want to learn more, share your work, or link up. And if you’ve got ideas for what this space could be, I’m all ears.

Let’s build the kind of ecosystem we’ve always needed.
