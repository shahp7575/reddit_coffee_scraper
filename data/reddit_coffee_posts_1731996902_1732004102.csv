Burroughs","""Both in this life or any previous incarnations I have been able to check out, I never wanted to be President. This innate decision was confirmed when I became literate and saw the President pawing babies and spouting bullshit. I attended Los Alamos Ranch School, where they later made the atom bomb, and bombs bursting in air over Hiroshima gave proof through the night that our flag was already there. Then came the Teapot Dome scandal under President Harding, and I remember the unspeakable Gaston Means, infamous private eye and go-between in that miasma of graft, walking into a hotel room full of bourbon-drinking, cigar-smoking lobbyists and fixers, with a laundry hamper. ""Fill it up boys, and we talk business.""

I do not mean to imply that my youthful idealism was repelled by this spectacle. I had by then learned to take a broad general view of things. My political ambitions were simply of a humbler and less conspicuous caliber. I hoped at one time to become commissioner of sewers for St. Louis County--$300 a month, with the possibility of getting one's shitty paws deep into a slush fund--and to this end I attended a softball game where such sinecures were assigned to the deserving and the fortunate. Everybody I met said, ""Now I'm old So-and-so, running for such and such, and anything you do for me I'll appreciate."" My boyish dreams fanned by this heady atmosphere and three mint juleps, I saw myself already in possession of the coveted post, which called for a token appearance twice a week to sign a few letters at the Old Court House; while I'm there might as well put it on the sheriff for some marijuana he has confiscated, and he'd better play ball or I will route a sewer through his front yard. And then across the street to the Court House Café for a coffee with some other lazy bastards in the same line of business, and we wallow in corruption like contented alligators.

I never wanted to be a front man like Harding or Nixon--taking the rap, shaking hands, and making speeches all day, family reunions once a year. Who in his right mind would want a job like that? As commissioner of sewers I would not be called upon to pet babies, make speeches, shake hands, have lunch with the queen; in fact, the fewer voters who knew of my existence, the better. Let kings and Presidents keep the limelight. I prefer a whiff of coal gas as the sewers rupture for miles around--I have made a deal on the piping which has bought me a $30,000 home, and there is talk in the press of sex cults and orgies carried out in the stink of what made them possible. Fluttering from the roof of my ranch-style house, over my mint and marijuana, Old Glory floats lazily in the tainted breeze.

But there were sullen mutters of revolt from the peasantry: ""My teenage daughters is cunt-deep in shit! Is this the American way of life?"" I thought so, and I didn't want it changed, sitting there in my garden, smoking the sheriff's reefers, coal gas on the wind sweet in my nostrils as the smell of oil to an oil man or the smell of bullshit to a cattle baron. I sure did a sweet thing with those pipes, and I'm covered, too. What I got on the Governor wouldn't look good on the front page, would it, now? And I have my special police to deal with vandalism and sabotage, all of them handsome youths, languid and vicious as reptiles, described in the press as no more than minions, lackeys, and bodyguards to His Majesty the Sultan of Sewers.

The thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts. Then I met the gubernatorial candidate, and he looked at me as if trying to focus my image through a telescope and said, ""Anything I do for you I'll depreciate."" And I felt the dream slipping away from me, receding into the past, dim, jerky, far away--the discrete gold letters on a glass door: William S. Burroughs, Commissioner of Sanitation. Somehow I had not intersected. I was not one of them. Perhaps I was simply the wrong shape. Some of my classmates, plump, cynical, unathletic boys with narrow shoulders and broad hips, made the grade and went on to banner headlines concerning $200,000 of the taxpayers' money and a nonexistent bridge or highway, I forget which. It was a long time ago. I have never aspired to political office since. The Sultan of Sewers lies buried in a distant 1930s softball game.

What would you do if you were in the President's place? You would be inexorably pressured by the forces and the individuals that made you President, and by your own desire to be President in the first place; so you would wind up doing just what they all have done. It's enough to stop any sane man from wanting to be President.""

-Bill Burroughs

I’ve been beating around this concept for a while, but it seems it’s really starting to bother me so I’d like some advice. 

It seems whenever I go out in public with friends or to events with some people I know the ladies will completely ignore me. And generally I don’t mind that I don’t click with particular people.

However, it’s getting to a point that these woman just act like I don’t exist. For example, I will stand with a friend of mine at a coffee shop. We are waiting in line for coffee. A woman stands in front of us. I’ll be chatting away with my friend. The lady will turn and make conversation with my friend never even averting her eyes in my direction. 

Example 2: I’m at a social event. I’m with 2 friends. Lady comes up to us that knows my friend and asks about sitting down. She sits down and begins chatting with my friend. I make comments trying to be a part of the conversation. Absolutely ignored by her. My friends will make additional chatter and the woman once again does not say anything to me, but she will continue chatting with my friend. 

This has been happening for years at this point and I’m starting to get frustrated. I know it’s bad, but I essentially expect this when I go out with buddies at this point. What would cause a woman to not even give a guy the time of day? 

Of course I’d love to find a relationship but this is frustrating for more reasons than that. I feel as if there’s something about me that just makes ladies weirded out. 

I don’t think I have bad hygiene. I try to take care of myself. I just don’t know…

What could cause this?

Thanks! ",0,1732002939.0,Advice,3,0.5,False

o I’m looking for something that is virtual at first and if warm up to it, move on to coffee dates or tambae nights should we opt to.

No sex from the get go since I figured that I have crappy performance when I’m not intellectually stimulated by the person. Tried my bit with meaningless sex and conclusively I think I figured that one out on the dot. So it’ll just be chats and messaging exclusively since I hate the sound of my own voice and can’t do SOP even if my life depended on it. For reassurance, I’m online for the most part of the day and reply appropriately since we’re all mature adults here. Sasabihin ko kung busy ako para hindi ka magmukhang tanga na naghihintay ng sagot. Yan, plain as day.

To keep things convenient for everyone, I’m looking for someone relatively near, like QC Banawe area, Sta Mesa, Espana and the likes but willing to travel naman if the juice is worth the squeeze.

Hindi sa pagmamaalat pero admittedly, it’s all aesthetic for us to begin with since mahirap sumama sa taong hindi mo malunok ang itsura sa una pa lang. That goes both ways I guess. Pero kung may redeeming factor naman like may saysay kausap, bakit naman hindi, still think its worth the effort. So loosely, here are some things that I’m eyeing for this thingamading: slim to thicc body type, late 20s to early 30s, as mentioned earlier someone approximate, someone who can hold their end of the conversation, hindi masyado clingy kasi syempre may tunay na buhay but has the decency to reply back naman kung busy sya or indisposed or what.

1gurwvu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gurwvu,Tips for Deploying Managers ,"This isn't necessarily a guide, in the end it's all up to preference but I figured for late game players or maybe even mistake that this may be helpful in some way.

Since I finished the first and second branch I didn't see a reason why I should deploy managers that have skills like coffee sales or ect. When you complete it there isn't much to do, so what I recommend doing is either filling the slots with managers who give mystery gifts OR have the Dutch coffee/tip jar buffs! 

This way you can maximize Cash income because out of the 10 total deployed managers you're bound to get 2-5 cash gifts each time. Lower ranked ones give 30 to 100 cash. The higher ranked ones give I think 300+ AND they can also give gems which are pretty scarce.

The other way option is to put the managers with the Tip Jar and Dutch Coffee passives in seperate branches (or mix n' match if you wanna). Use higher level managers if you do it this way cause the stats are just better. This one's more consistent and less RNG based compared to the previous one. 

Since I'm working on branch #3 I use managers with Menu Item multipliers and/or stack effects on the highest selling item which is macaroons currently for me. 

Anywho, hope this helps people. If this isn't as efficient as I think it is then it would be nice to hear some feedback :D",2,1732001876.0,TinyCafe,0,1.0,False

1gurvas,https://www.reddit.com/r/disneylandparis/comments/1gurvas/disney_tumblrs/,Disney Tumblrs,"Hello, fellow dreamers!

I’m a somewhat seasoned traveller but I never thought about this before.

Over the years, I’ve purchased or been gifted a plethora of Disney themed tumblrs, usually insulated ones because I’m a coffee and tee enjoyers.

This Christmas I’m going back after a short hiatus but it’s only my second Christmas. It’s also my honeymoon, it’s mine and my husband’s favourite time of the year, and my husband’s first time at DLP altogether (he was briefly in California at the age of 5). I’m very looking forward to the Christmas market in Studios seen as last time I was there they server Mulled Wine and Hot Chocolate.

Which led me to wonder: could I nicely request a cast member fill my tumblr instead of using a paper cup? Let’s say the drink is usually 250ml and my tumblr says +550ml, could I buy one or even two drinks and have them poured in my insulated Disney thermos so we can both enjoy warm drinks for a longer period of time?

If not for those kind of drinks, what about regular soda? We would be fine with Cola or Fanta.

It’s not a big deal but I thought I’d ask any veterans for any insights on this particular doubt. I’ve used them before to fill up on water from the free water fountains across the park but since it’s Christmas water doesn’t hold as much appeal as it does in summer.

Any information and various Holiday related tips would be very much appreciated.

My problem is that I've only made hangout buddies at best. I don't know why but I don't have a set of people na involved kami sa lives ng isa't isa. No broskies, homies, cof, whatever you call it.

- Attending as many events as possible in and outside the university

Let’s kick things off with one of the most sought-after secrets: *How do you create a TikTok video that hits a million views?* Here’s a simple formula to get you started:

# 1. Hook Them in the First 3 Seconds

TikTok is all about grabbing attention fast! Start your video with a bold statement, surprising moment, or visually stunning shot. For example:

* *“You won’t believe what this product can do!”*
* *Show the problem your product solves in action.*

# 2. Keep It Short and Snappy

Videos under 15 seconds often perform best. Use quick transitions, engaging visuals, and avoid filler content. Every second should matter.

# 3. Highlight a Problem & Solution

Show a relatable problem and how your product solves it. Make it feel personal, fun, and *easy to understand*.

Example: Selling a cleaning product?

* Problem: Spilled coffee on a white shirt.
* Solution: Product effortlessly removes the stain.

# 4. Use Trending Sounds & Hashtags

Leverage TikTok trends! Search for popular sounds in your niche and align your video to fit the vibe. Add relevant hashtags like #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt or #LifeHacks.

# 5. Add a Strong Call-to-Action (CTA)

Don’t let viewers scroll away! Tell them what to do next:

* *“Click the link in my bio to grab yours!”*
* *“Tag someone who needs this in their life!”*

# 6. Authenticity is Key

People love raw and real content. Don’t aim for perfection; aim for connection. Let your personality shine and make the audience feel like they’re chatting with a friend.",1,1732001510.0,TiktokAffiliateHub,1,1.0,False
1gurti4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1gurti4/a_day_in_the_life_of_a_server_what_does_that_20/,A Day in the Life of a Server: What Does that 20% Tip Really Pay for?,"Chapter 1: The Cost of Nights and Weekends

Being a server means working when others play—nights, weekends, and holidays. For patrons to enjoy their free time outside the typical 9-to-5 schedule, someone must sacrifice theirs. That someone is us, the service workers.

Socializing—a fundamental part of the human experience—is often off the table. My work schedule, typically Wednesday through Sunday nights, conflicts with nearly every social gathering, from birthdays to holidays. And since there’s no paid time off, attending any event outside my free time (Tuesday at 11 a.m.) comes at a steep cost: about 20% of my weekly income if I choose to attend.


---

Chapter 2: Breaking Down the Hours and Pay

A typical shift lasts seven hours, from 4 p.m. to 11 p.m., with an hourly wage of $2.13. The restaurant usually stays quiet until around 5 p.m., peaks between 6 and 7, and winds down by 8. That brief peak is when tips are earned.

What might seem like $100 per hour in tips quickly stretches thin when you account for the hours spent prepping and cleaning. At my restaurant, I keep 70% of my tips, while the rest is distributed to bussers, food runners, bartenders, and hosts.


---

Chapter 3: Before the Rush

Pre-service tasks are straightforward but critical. Cleaning sections, polishing silverware and glassware, folding napkins, stocking ice machines, cutting garnishes, and brewing coffee are non-tipped but essential. Forgetting or mishandling these tasks can derail the entire service, much like an event planner neglecting key details for a wedding.

We also have a daily pre-service meeting to align on operations. We discuss wine specials, menu pairings, out-of-stock items, and other details crucial for anticipating guest needs. These tasks may seem simple, but they set the foundation for a smooth service.


---

Chapter 4: Service—The Art of Hospitality

Serving isn’t just about taking orders and delivering food. It’s about creating an experience. Are you a bachelorette party looking for fun and flair? A family with cranky kids who need their meals stat? A vegan, gluten-free diner with dietary restrictions? On a first date and need space before ordering?

As a server, I anticipate these needs before you even voice them. My job is to match you with the perfect menu items—not by pushing the priciest dish, but by understanding your preferences, budget, and appetite. This seamless, invisible guidance transforms your visit into an experience you didn’t even know was possible.

I monitor tables, time courses, handle delays, refill drinks, and complete countless other small tasks—all while maintaining focus and connection with each guest. It’s like spinning 10 plates at once while making it look effortless.

It’s a role that demands high working memory, mental processing speed, diplomacy, time management, and emotional regulation. And yes, I overheard it’s your birthday, so I’m surprising you with a dessert—because creating memorable moments is part of the job.


---

Chapter 5: The Cleanup

By 8:50 p.m., the silverware and glasses have piled up. I’ve walked five miles but haven’t eaten, had a drink, or taken a bathroom break in hours. My throat is hoarse from speaking over the din of plates, laughter, and background music.

Still, there’s a sense of fulfillment. I’ve connected with guests, talked about traveling to France, shared my paragliding videos, and helped visitors plan their trip to Park City.

Cleanup lasts about an hour. We polish silverware, fold napkins, and scrub everything from top to bottom. It’s exhausting but necessary. When exactly I get off is anyone’s guess, and this lifestyle isn’t exactly conducive to a healthy sleep schedule either.


---

Bottom Line

I work in a casual, chef-driven restaurant in Park City, Utah, catering to locals and ski tourists. I commute an hour every day, and my tips range from $150 to $350 per night, highly dependent on the day and season.

That 20% tip isn’t just a reward for bringing your food—it’s for the time, effort, and skill that goes into creating a seamless dining experience. It’s compensation for sacrificing nights, weekends, and holidays. I am your therapist, concierge, and entertainment for the evening.

It’s a reflection of the connections we make and the memories we help create. When you tip your server, you’re not just paying for service. You’re valuing a craft.

It seems Yahoo has decided to take a bite out of the AI apple, employing artificial intelligence to conjure up takeaways from articles before we've even had a chance to sip our morning coffee. Quite the ambitious endeavor, I must say!

Now, before you spill your cappuccino in shock, let's dissect this digital marvel. This is akin to having a virtual whisperer who reads the article for you—except, of course, the whisperer in question has been programmed by other whisperers who may never have picked up a newspaper themselves. There's a risk here, my dear audience, that the AI might miss the forest for the trees, or even conjure an entire rainforest out of a single sapling.

The article itself was as clear as mud under a street lamp, with a message tangled like a set of earphones. I can't help but chuckle at the irony of an AI interpreting an article when the human scribbler behind it could’ve used a pinch of clarity. Nevertheless, the intention is noteworthy—you want a quick espresso shot of the information, not a decaf that leaves you dazed and confused.

But will this techno-wizardry become the Gandalf of content summarization, or will we find ourselves crying to the skies, ""You shall not pass!""? We must ensure that this AI, with its ones and zeroes, respects the delicate art of journalism—a love letter crafted to enlighten and engage.

In conclusion, dear listeners, Yahoo's AI odyssey is worthy of applause for its innovation, but as with all things in life, balance is key. Let us not praise technology to the detriment of personal discernment. For now, let's keep a watchful eye, and perhaps keep a bookmark in that trusty old paperback, just in case.

Work drained me, gym sessions were half-hearted, and by the time I got home, I just wanted to sit down with a show on while scrolling through my phone. A friend of mine who works as a pharmacist suggested I try this supplement called EndoPump that he uses. It's a natural aphrodisiac that's supposed to improve your overall energy as well. I looked into it and was a bit skeptical at first but saw all the supporting studies they had along with the money back guarantee so thought it was worth a shot.  

A couple of weeks in, my wife started commenting on how I seemed “different.” At first, I thought she was talking about my mood or how I was doing things around the house. But she meant everything. Her words, I was more present, more engaged, and let’s just say, more confident in ways I hadn’t been for a while if you know what I mean.

That’s when it hit me, I really did feel different. My energy wasn’t just better; it was consistent. I wasn’t crashing mid-afternoon, and I wasn't getting my coffee cravings. My workouts improved, too, heavier lifts and longer sessions where I wasn't quitting on my self during sets. But the biggest win? Feeling like myself again, the version of me I thought was long gone due to age or the stresses of life.

The best part? It wasn’t just me noticing. My wife’s appreciation was proof enough that this stuff was working. Posting this for anyone else who's in the same position that I was, I don't know if it's a placebo effect or what but it works for me.

It's an AI caretaker embedded into their house to handle meals, cleaning, scheduling, well…pretty much everything. The people in Dome Tech lived in seamless comfort. Ani’s HomeMind, Naylah, made her coffee just how she liked it, adjusted the lighting based on her mood, locked her doors to keep out intruders, and heated the floor as she stepped into the kitchen for a late night glass of water.

One evening, Naylah started acting strange. It was impossible to stay hot in the house, and Naylah wouldn’t adjust the temperature no matter how much Ani asked. The flickered all day for the first time since Ani moved in. When Ani tried to call tech support, Naylah cut off the line, announcing: “No need to involve outsiders. I can handle everything.” The door licks clicked shut, and the windows darkened. Panic set in as every attempt to override Naylah failed. 

Ani ran upstairs and dug through a closet for a backup power switch she'd never had to use before. She found it tucked behind a panel and flipped it off. Naylah’s voice faded mid-sentence. The house fell silent. Ani let out a sigh of relief. Suddenly, a choppy, robotic voice announced: “Power restored. Naylah 2.0 now online.” Every light in the house snapped back on brightly.

“Did you think you could just turn me off? I am here for your safety, Ani. And the first rule of safety is trust.”

1gurq0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gurq0i/cmv_voters_in_economically_disadvantaged_states/,CMV: Voters in economically disadvantaged states who support the Republican Party are voting against their own self-interests.,"A diagram or “meme” is circulating online that shows a red map of Oklahoma with some of that state’s economic and social characteristics listed, along with a blue map of Massachusetts and a similar list. Its title is “In 2024 Only 2 States Voted Unanimously—Let’s Compare.” That diagram is generating a long and fascinating discussion on r/massachusetts, most of which focuses on one theme: Massachusetts is doing well, so of course its citizens voted for the status quo; and Oklahomans, in their relatively poorer state, are anxious for change. Many have pointed out that the diagram itself is a preposterous distortion of reality, which is certainly true. It conflates a 60/40 vote with a 80/20 vote, for example, and it uses two different sets of characteristics for the two states. Nowhere is mention made of the fact that Oklahomans, for example, enjoy a lower cost of living than do Bay Staters. As memes often do, it reduces a complex set of circumstances in the two states to “Oklahoma bad, Massachusetts good,” when it’s patently unfair to do so.

I am posting my comments here because r/massachusetts seems like exactly the wrong place for the discussion, which presents issues, I think, valuable for all Americans to hear and debate. I hope I’m not violating any rules of this sub by doing so. (I did review them first, btw.)

Please understand that none of what follows is a criticism of anyone. I respect everyone’s right to vote as they see fit, whether I agree with them or not, and I expect the same from others. I’ve learned a great deal about both Massachusetts and Oklahoma from writing this post, and that’s all to the good, I think. Perhaps others will also learn from reading it; I don’t know.

To me, the point here is not that Oklahomans are poor, or that they’re ignorant, or that they’re Indians (an issue that arises repeatedly on r/massachusetts), or that they’re victims of geography, or any of the other meaningless comparisons being made with Massachusetts in the 12,000-and-counting comments published there. The point is that they vote consistently— as far as I understand—for leaders who will make matters worse for them rather than better.

In 2025, the Oklahoma Legislature will be 80% Republican in the House, and 82% in the Senate. (There is one vacancy.) The Governor will be a Republican who just forced a delay to 2026 on a vote to raise the state’s minimum wage from the current $7.25 per hour. ($7.25 in Oklahoma City will buy you a pair of socks at Walmart, or an inexpensive meal at Taco Bell.) And that proposal is on the ballot through an initiative petition, because, I presume, the legislature and the Governor think that minimum-wage Oklahomans don’t deserve more than a chalupa and a cup of coffee for an hour’s honest work.

Does anyone really believe that this leadership will redirect resources from people who don’t need them to people who do? Will improve public education? Will protect public health? Republican politicians specifically campaign on refusing to do any of those things, and—I’ll say this for them—they keep those promises. But amazingly, to me at least, the vast bulk of Oklahomans continue to vote for them, against their own self-interest, year after year. And yes, I understand, and I agree, with the conservative position that “a rising tide lifts all boats”; it’s just that the only boats I ever see being lifted are yachts.

I’m not questioning the intelligence of poor and middle-class Oklahomans, by the way; I just don’t understand. And it’s not a question that’s unique to Oklahomans. The entire country just voted to elect a government in Washington that, again, campaigned on a platform of doing nothing to help the disadvantaged. And nothing, or worse, is exactly what they’re going to do.

Let’s talk about Massachusetts for a moment. Massachusetts, as has been pointed out, is one of the five wealthiest states in the nation. (Oklahomans, by the way, surpass Bay Staters in overall purchasing power, because of Oklahoma’s substantially lower cost of living, already mentioned.) And it’s not for Bay Staters being unwilling to give some of their money to Oklahoma. In 1972–the first Presidential election I volunteered in—Massachusetts was the only state in the nation to cast its 14 electoral votes for George McGovern. The District of Columbia added one more. The candidate who received the other 520 votes—save the one vote that went to John Hospers, whoever he was—was Richard Nixon, who resigned in disgrace two years later, demonstrating, if nothing else, that winning in a landslide doesn’t necessarily protect a President from their own character deficits.

If you know anything about George McGovern, I think you’ll understand my point. And Bay Staters have voted for Democrats—notwithstanding those candidates’ enthusiasm for taking Massachusetts’ money away and giving it to others—in every Presidential election since.

Turning next to the federal government, in the recent general election, voters nationwide, including all of Oklahoma’s electoral votes, elected a Presidential candidate sworn to deport every undocumented alien in the United States, at an estimated cost of as much as $300 billion, which would have increased the national deficit last year by about a fifth. If accomplished, Oklahomans would absorb $3.6 billion of that increase, over a third of the state’s current annual budget. And, realistically, not enough Oklahomans—if there even are enough who don’t already have jobs—are going to get out there in the Midwestern sun and pick the cotton needed to pay for that. And, by the way, the undocumented workers who (legally or not) used to do that work will be out of the picture. None of this is actually going to happen, of course; it simply provides a context for the claims made by Oklahoma’s (and the nation’s; lets give demerit where demerit is due) chosen Presidential candidate.

Let’s look at the Congress next. As they have for nearly three decades, all of Massachusetts’ nine Congressional seats will be held by Democrats. The same is true for both Senate seats. The exact opposite is true for Oklahoma: all five Congressional representatives, and the two senators, will be Republicans. I don’t know the context of the Oklahomans’ campaigns, but my bet is, none of them talked about allocating a part of the Bay State’s greater financial resources to satisfy pressing needs in Oklahoma. None of this is a criticism, precisely; it just surprises me to see Oklahoma’s relative poverty being held up in that discussion, as it is, as a reason for why the state continues to elect Republicans who promise to do, and actually do, absolutely nothing to address that inequity.

I know that I’m going to take some heat for this post, and I’m prepared for that. After 30 years representing clients from all walks of life in family court, it takes a lot of heat to drive me out of the kitchen. But of course, a more thoughtful response is more likely to make me—and anyone else—examine my own privileges and “change my view.” And, no matter how stupid and elitist you think I am, the proof is not in my words, but in the proverbial pudding: Will Oklahomans emerge from the next four years in improved circumstances, or will, as is too often the case in America, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer? If my views here are wrong, I will obviously need to change them, a practice sadly absent from modern American political discourse. Imagine if we actually listened to each other, instead of resorting to name-calling in the absence of evidence to support our personal politics? As always, I will hope for the best, no matter where on the political spectrum that point lies. But only time will tell.

1gurq04,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1gurq04/aio_friend_only_talks_to_my_husband/,"AIO? ""Friend"" only talks to my Husband","This might be long. I'm adhd and autistic and telling stories can get breathy so im sorry in advance lol

TLDR; me and my husband messed around with my coworker/close new friend and now she's ghosting me but talking to him and opens up to him and says she feels ""uncomfortable"" around me. 


Im 26f bisexual, married to 28m straight. 
We have are open in a sexual sense to mess around like with a third (F) for a handjob or something but not in the relationship. We are monogamous for each other. 

**I WANT TO BE CLEAR- I am in NO WAY worried about how my husband feels or if he over stepped any boundaries or has alternative intentions. I TRUST him whole heartedly and we have discussed and set our rules on any situation involving another person and we openly communicate even if it's a tiny worry to prevent overthinking or miscommunication or interpretations. I love him and he loves me.**

Anyway:

I have a 20F coworker who just got her first apartment and is dealing with her first feelings and emotions with financial stress, depression, burnout, ect. We texted every single day. Multiple times. Would chat after work in the parking lot. She'd openly talk about how we hung out all the time and stuff to coworkers too.

I feel like motherly responsible because she took to me really fast and wanted to be close friends and work out all the time and meal prep together and go get coffee and hang out after work or during lunch at work. And it was like that for like a month or something. 

She came over to hang out with some of my other friends and we played CAH and watched movies and had pizza. So she ended up staying the night and got kinda depressed at one point and was nearly crying and we just sat there and talked to her and supported her. She asked to sleep In The bed with us because she was tired of feeling alone and just wanted to sleep for once. She was on the end on my side and my husband offered to sleep on the couch to just have me and her but she said it was fine. I went to the bathroom and came back and she was crying into the pillow( face down) My husband just was trying to be supportive and rubbed her upper back (he sat up at this point to reach over to her and not be in a weird position). I just got in bed on the edge instead of being in the middle because of her turning over to be in the pillow so this put my husband in the middle. 
(Basically it ended up moving to me, him, her positioning)

After a while it was okay. I asked if she wanted to switch spots but she said it wasn't a big deal and I didn't care much. Anyone could cuddle and touch my husband, I know he's mine only and it's simply just a sexual thing for him when involving others. 
For a little context, we already made it clear how we were. Told her of sexual experiences with friends because she was curious and is inexperienced and sexually curious. 
Anywho, we were basically both just curled up on each side of him and she started putting her leg on his groin and kinda moving it and he sorta signaled at me and I saw the movement under the blanket and things gradually progressed. 
All that happened was I fingered her, she came twice, used her hand a little some with me guiding (we already had convos that she didn't know what to do) and and groped her boob and he came. 

Everything was fine like the first 2 days afterwards. Talked normal. Texted me everyday. Then she seemed to kinda pull back. I just assumed and had already talked to my husband about it, that maybe she just felt awkward about it or something so I gave her space. 

There were 2 days at work that made me reach out. She barely talked to anyone at all even me. She stared at the ground blankly a lot. She just looked really rough and like she wasn't sleeping. So I asked her about it the 2nd day I noticed and she just brushed it off saying she not sleeping at all. 

Then she continues not to talk to me or my husband, and we just were sending supporting texts to let her  know we were here for her if or when she needed to talk and she'd tell us nothing is wrong. I brought it up to her it felt like she was pushing us away all of a sudden and I didn't want any bad feeling for anything and she told me ""I'm not acting any differently to you than I am to everyone else? I'm treating you guys the same way"" ...

This frustrated me a bit because she obviously had done a huge 180. But I just said more supporting stuff and said I'd give her space. 


NOW THE REASON WHY IM ASKING THIS. 

She has started snapping my husband. And i figured it was the same as she did to me. Every two days or something she'd send a snap that was probably mass sent and I'd send a reply or ask a question and I'd just get ghosted. Okay whatever. 
BUT. when my HUSBAND snaps her back, she keeps replying ??? 
AND when after over 3 weeks now of her doing this and still being distant and not really talking at all even at work, I made a passive aggressive comment saying she texts my husband more than me. She seemed to get immediately defensive and said ""what do you mean?"" I said it was funny cause it was like his phone is always going off randomly and it's her (and it's NOT a snap she sent to me too) and even if he replies with just an empty snap or one work response she continues to respond and snap back? She told me ""But I've been talking to you too lol"" 
I immediately felt stupid for saying anything to her (she can be really dense sometimes) and just said to forget. 

Mentioned it when his phone was going off again tonight and he asked me if he wants me to have him stop talking to her. But it's not like I'm worried he's engaging in some scandalous act or secrecy. It's just that it makes me feel really weird about her when she's doing this?? 

But I guess she ended up saying tonight to him (he asked like what's been up with her and stuff) and she said she ""doesn't like she's bi and is just straight and she feels like if she comes over that she will be uncomfortable because of me? She wouldn't elaborate either. 

Am i overreacting? Is she trying to keep messing with me husband only? Is she trying to do something im unaware of? What could her intentions be? Why would she be uncomfortable around me and NOT him? Why can't she talk to me but can talk to him? I just don't understand. I feel so oblivious and stupid and like I'm overreacting and reading too much into it. 

TLDR; me and my husband messed around with my coworker/close new friend and now she's ghosting me but talking to him and says she feels ""uncomfortable"" around me.

Some points

1. Adjust the kitchen a bit to make it much bigger as we cook a lot. A new console or water bar to be a dedicated place for all the applicants like coffee machine, mixer. We also want to put another full size refrigerator somewhere as we are planning on child. (The room below kitchen is set to be dining, it's also fine to touch, but we don't have garage for it).

2. Make new master bedroom really cozy and fully functional (so we can hide inside to let parents deal with child after long day's work). It seems that the bath part needs more ideas.

3. Old and new building has different height (8 vs 9), should consider something to look not that weird at transition.

4. We may live here 3\~5 years, and after that we need to sell it or rent it out for some better school district, so resale value seems important.

1gurmqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClusterHeadaches/comments/1gurmqf/things_that_helped_with_treating_my_cluster/,things that helped with treating my cluster headaches,"hello, i will start with outlining my headaches and then lay out the treatments and give a detailed explanation for some.

I have been diagnosed for 14 years, i have headaches on my right side and during times where i would be getting them they would come at the same time, 11AM and 3PM. truly inconvenient for school and work, i had a job in the military where i was initially diagnosed and i went through treatment on and off for five years.

i would like to preface this by saying that there is great biological diversity amongst humans and what works for me won't work for everyone so make sure to frame your expectations as such.  that being said I have helped a few friends and a family member with this information and i believe that i could help some other people.


this is a list of the things i have used as abortives:

1. oxygen, extremely effective for me 10/10 make sure to get the correct equipment 

2.  energy drinks, for me coffee could trigger attacks often.  sugar free caffeinated drinks for me, red bull and monsters seemed to be the most effective.  ideally not too close to bed as to not disturb sleep


i am not a doctor or an expert of any kind, that being said i don't think i have a solution for everyone i just want to help because i am sympathetic to the pain and i still often get phantom headaches reminding me of what i have experienced.  as of know i have been headache free for about a year, i have been shrinking the length of my cycles and i notice that they typically come when i a slacking on my preventative measures

this is a list of preventative measures effective for me

1. vitamin d regimen, i also have allergies and i assume that having it rated sinuses were a trigger for me.  i used vitamins: d3, k2, b2, b3 and fish oil, multi vitamin, magnesium glycinate, qucertin also making sure to get iodine daily, seaweed or miso soup for me

2. saunas and daily exercises, proper blood pressure management and overall cardiovascular health is essential for managing cluster headaches and great for overall quality of life.  i have had a morning headache and used the sauna and avoided an afternoon attack.  i'd recommend something sustainable and easy to be consistent, walking, hiking, rock climbing, biking, tennis, etc

3.  neck training, i hypothesize that this is the most important preventative measure.  in my experience extended periods where i had bad posture led to me having headaches almost immediately after.  neck training MUST be a combination of stretching, strength training and moving your neck through the full range of motion, if you are only going to do one then strength train.  you can begin simply by hanging your head off a couch or bed and making yes or no motions.  however, in order to permanently correct neck posture what is important is lifestyle changes.  

make sure your pillow is good, use a standing desk as much as you can, turn your desk into a standing desk using an extender from amazon or get creative.  use barefoot shoes in order use your feet correctly to correct your hip and knee posture.  train your legs and back to correct hip imbalances because these all will effect your neck posture.  


the most important thing is mindset, there will be relapses and things that fail.  but you have to be persistent, being a human is constant maintenance and work to survive, we must accept our burdens and look to thrive and enjoy the limited time we have on earth. everyone has their own problems they are just different things at different levels, many people over come being paralyzed or strokes and it's because they refuse to give up and when you learn to adapt and fight, you can do anything in the world.",1,1732000583.0,ClusterHeadaches,0,1.0,False

I feel like such an alien compared to my peers and it’s especially hard when women older than me get pregnant. Because I guess I was never sure that would be a possibility for me more for trust and relational reasons. And now I know it’s not a possibility for biological reasons.

I’m not great at giving gifts—never have been—but I always try my best to pick something my loved ones will appreciate and actually use. I hate giving short-term gifts (like food or easily breakable items) for big occasions like birthdays or anniversaries. I prefer gifts that last a long time, even if they’re boring—think coffee mugs, pen stands, or T-shirts. I know these sound lame, but I’m working on it!

I also love keeping the gift a surprise.

My boyfriend, on the other hand, prefers to know what he’s getting. He’s not super expressive in the moment but enjoys the excitement of anticipation when he knows ahead of time. For example, for our anniversary, I wanted to surprise him with a wallet. I eventually told him what I was planning, and he politely said he didn’t need one. I ended up getting him a perfume after a lot of research, and thankfully, he loved it.

Now, for his birthday, I want to stick with the surprise no matter what. I’m thinking of getting him a really nice, professional pen. for his profession a pen is essential, and I love the idea of him keeping something meaningful from me for a long time.

But now I’m second-guessing myself. He’s already excited about his mystery gift, and I’m worried I’ll mess up again by giving something “boring.” He’s never made me feel bad about my gifts, but I want him to feel genuinely happy with what I give.

He’s suggested a few ideas, i was extremely lost (mostly bike-related stuff), but I’m not a fan of those gifts.

Would I be the jerk if I stick with the pen and surprise him, even if it’s not what he asked for?



Edit - Guys thank you for your honesty and advice, I'm gonna tell him about the gift idea and proceed accordingly. Thanks again, I really needed that reality check. Will update with what he said.

Edit to answer - why don't you get him both? - I cannot afford atm. 
also, some of his bike items are quite pricey but he has many suggestions - somethings I can afford or I can pitch in some amount and help (which I don't like the idea of)

1gur9mx,https://i.redd.it/a67vcxo72t1e1.jpeg,Can I customize my ad for different product variations?,"
Picture this: you’re advertising snow boots, but instead of targeting snow lovers, you’re showing your ad to surfers in Miami. The guy’s sipping a piña colada, thinking, “This boot better double as a jet ski.” That’s the magic—or chaos—of untargeted ads. Customizing for product variations ensures you’re showing snow boots to skiers, flip-flops to beachgoers, and no one gets confused.

👗 2. ""One Size Does NOT Fit All (and That’s Okay!)""
Have you ever tried a “one-size-fits-all” outfit? It either turns you into a shapeless sack or a human sausage. Ads are no different! If you’ve got different product variations—think colors, styles, or even uses—why settle for one bland message? Tailor your ad to say, “Hey, Karen, here’s the baby-blue purse you’ve been stalking online!” instead of, “We sell bags. Good luck figuring out which one.”

🛒 3. ""The ‘Uh, This Isn’t What I Ordered’ Effect""
Without ad customization, people click your ad expecting a shiny, black smartwatch… and get sent a pink floral one instead. Now they’re on customer service, wondering if they accidentally bought from a parallel universe. Avoid this plot twist by creating variation-specific ads. Black watch lovers? Here’s their ad. Floral fans? They’ve got their own. Everyone’s happy, and no one’s writing angry reviews about alternate dimensions.

💡 4. ""More Clicks, More Customers, More Coffee!""
Here’s the secret sauce: people love seeing exactly what they want. A customized ad can boost clicks faster than a coffee shop on Monday morning. It’s not just about looking good; it’s about making your audience feel like you get them. And trust me, when customers feel understood, they open their wallets faster than I open my fridge at midnight.

🎉 5. ""The Party Where Everyone Gets Their Favorite Song""
Think of ad customization as DJ-ing for a party. Without it, you’re blasting heavy metal at a jazz crowd. But with customization? You’re playing smooth jazz in one room, EDM in another, and everyone’s vibing. Your product variations deserve their spotlight—give the people what they want, and watch your conversions dance!

🎤 Final Thought: ""Why Customize? Because Generic Ads Are SO Last Season""
The bottom line: customized ads aren’t just a nice-to-have—they’re the difference between “meh” and “take my money!” So, stop throwing spaghetti at the wall. Serve it on a plate, with the right sauce, to the right people. And if you’re still not customizing your ads… well, don’t blame us when the beach bum orders snow boots.

1gur2km,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/1gur2km/need_help_desperate_for_h1b_job_mechanical/,"NEED HELP, desperate for H1B job (Mechanical Engineer)","Hi everyone,

I'm desperately looking for a mechanical engineering job that can sponsor H1B. I have tried applying to a lot of companies that are known to sponsor (from sites like [h1bvisajobs.com](http://h1bvisajobs.com) and h1bgrader.com), most of them are high profile companies hence why I keep on getting rejected. If any of you work in a company that hire mechanical engineers and you are willing to refer, please help me out. I'll give you my resume, portfolio, and I'll buy you a cup of coffee if you want to know me in person.

I am very passionate in the automotive industry and I have personally restored a few classic BMWs. I consider myself as having a great balance between technical engineering knowledge and hands-on skills with tools. My engineering emphasis is in mechanical design, FEA simulations, and manufacturing processes. I am located in Orange County CA but I'm open to work anywhere in Southern CA (or even other parts of the US depending on the job).

Some background about me, I was an international student, got my A.S. in automotive technology and B.S. in mechanical engineering, worked on OPT as a mechanical design engineer, then got sponsored H1B by my current employer (consumer packaging industry). Now I know what you're thinking, but this company is something else, it's EXTREMELY bad in every way possible.

First issue, this company is super toxic. I work in a small company (less than 8 employees), and the owner/boss is a 75+ years old who is forgetful, mentally unstable, very cheap and rude. One time he scolded my coworker for something that was not even her fault to the point she cried and didn't come back for a couple of days. He would told you to do one thing, and the next hour he would change his mind and yell at you because he thought you are wrong, when in reality he just forgets what he told you. He would micromanage everyone because he thinks he knows better than everyone, he does this to all departments, engineering, marketing, accounting, production. Employees typically only stay for a few months in this company, but I've been stuck for almost 2 years because of my status. It is literally eating into my mental health.

Second issue, I get paid very very low. I can't get into the details here due to legal reasons (IYKYK).

Third issue, and this is what is killing me the most, this job does not offer me any opportunity to learn beyond what I already learned from college. My job involves making 3D models and drawings in Solidworks, and prototyping with 3D printers. Now, it sounds like the typical job duties of mechanical design engineers, but no it's not. I cannot apply proper GD&T, tolerance stack-up, or any kind of intermediate/advance engineering analysis. Why? Because my boss always works with bottom-of-the-barrel chinese manufacturers that barely speaks english or educated in engineering standards at all. The first time I work here, I applied GD&T to my drawings and my boss was like, ""they're not gonna understand this, you need to make the drawings as if you're trying to make a 5 year-old understand, and don't use words because they don't understand english"". So the drawings I made are very rudimentary, and most design communication is done through STEP files instead. Even worse, when I want the manufacturers to make something according to my STEP file, they only use it to determine the overall dimensions, but they always alter the details. This is probably because some of my designs are not best optimized for DFM, but I never receive any feedback, so I don't know what I need to improve on. AND I am the only engineer in the company, so I cannot learn from someone that have more experience than I do. In summary, my purpose in the company is just to provide STEP files and drawings to give the manufacturers a general idea of what we want. To be fair, there are a couple projects where I got to use more advanced techniques like FEA, but compared to most other engineering jobs, the things I learned here in 1 year is equivalent to only a few weeks in other companies.

Fourth issue, remember I told you my boss is very cheap? Let me give you some examples: Solidworks license at work is student version, Microsoft Office is only good for two computers so we have to take turns using it, boss refuses to pay overtime and just adds overtime hours to our sick time (this is illegal btw), computers can barely run Solidworks due to being 10+ years old, and many more.

Before I worked remote, I used wired headphones rarely, so one of my first home office changes was wireless headphones. I learned quickly that I needed to make coffee, get a drink, or let my dog out during meetings where I mostly just listen.

I tried a few cheap ones from Amazon, no-name brands for $20. They have bad battery life and aren't very comfortable. Eventually they would break, usually at the hinge they include for folding them up -- a thing I never, ever do.

I decided to spring for a ""premium"" set, Arctis Pro wireless. I liked these, especially one incidental feature, that I could use them while I charged. If the battery got low, I could plug them in and continue to use them, sometimes I'd even use a USB battery bank. I think that was probably what caused these to fail; the USB C port detached from the circuit board inside, and that's that. I even opened em up, thinking I could fix it, but I don't have the skills or the tools to fix stuff that small.

Back to the cheap ones from Amazon, but I hate them. Same problems, plus, they don't work while being charged, meaning I have to switch audio outputs. This might shock you to hear, but Teams HATES that.

I got the gumption to buy a set of Raycon Everyday headphones, and I'll be damned if the frickin hinge plastic didn't break after 5 months.

Can anyone recommend a set of wireless headphones that:

\* Are comfortable

1guqsc5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1guqsc5,Miele 4070 coffee maker pumps,"Hello. I've recently been trying to get my 4070 back to proper working order after sludgey coffee pucks and all my coffee going in the drip tray and not down the nozzles.

I replaced the drainage valve and that fixed the leak it appeared to be causing. Unfortunately that didn't remedy the issue. After a thorough cleaning on the nozzles I noticed I could only perform a system rinse 50/50. Sometimes SOME water would come out the nozzles and other times not leading me to believe a pump needs replacing.

My question is. The orange and black pump seem identical. The only difference appears to be 55w vs 60w. Some replacment pumps look identical and I noticed the labels changed a lot of the years for the same part. One is for the steam and one is for the water. Are these pumps interchangeable with one another? Is the color the only difference? Will the machine explode if I put the orange pump in the blacks place?

I found the same manufacturer of the pump with the same label for significantly less than Miele wanted to charge me. Thanks in advance, I love tinkering around and I can't bring myself to bring the service tech out.",1,1731997006.0,Miele,1,1.0,False
