Then I started noticing something: I could *curate my own life*, choose my routines, and find joy in small things... a cup of coffee by the window, a walk in the park, or music blasting in my living room.

Being alone became an opportunity, not a punishment. I was learning to enjoy my own company and trust my choices.

So after 6+ months of conversations and couples therapy my partner (30f) and I (30m) are ready to give it a go. Looking for your thoughts on the profile description I‚Äôm working on.

General info on the situation:
- together for 12+ years exclusively, both lost our virginities to each other.
- looking for solo experiences, considered going to a sex club (LB) but that won‚Äôt satisfy our desire to play separately - unless I‚Äôm wrong on this?
- setting up individual Feeld accounts and will link them.
- I will have a head start using the apps as we read that it will likely take me some time to make connections and we ideally want to be on a similar timeline to start.
- I am above average looking and regularly receive attention while out - 5‚Äô11, full head of hair with a nice haircut and groomed beard, athletic(ish) to dad bod, and outgoing.
- Partner is also above average looking and I don‚Äôt see her having any issues finding matches.

‚Äî‚Äî = removed details in case anyone I know sees this post.

‚ÄúHello! 
 
My name is ‚Äî‚Äî  and I am a 30 year old ‚Äî‚Äî expat who spent a couple of years in ‚Äî‚Äî and now consider London home. 

I enjoy cooking, trying new restaurants, live music (‚Äî‚Äî- is a favourite), cycling, snowboarding, ice hockey, and meeting new people. My friends would describe me as outgoing, loyal, funny (hopefully) and caring. My idea of a good date is a coffee or pint in ‚Äî- park, walk to the butcher (or local grocer for veggie/vegan friends), home cooked dinner over a bottle of wine, and depending on the mood a cozy night in or evening out with a good dj or band.

I am in a  ENM relationship with a long term partner (30F) who I met when I was 18. We have decided to open our relationship up and are both seeking solo experiences. Happy to go into our boundaries and explanation further but in short we decided that after 12 years together and lots of chats about desires this lifestyle suits us.

I am straight and ideally looking to find a relationship but am also open to FWB and potentially one night stands. I will likely need to feel a spark and require a date without the expectations of play before getting romantically involved. 

There is no desire for a three-some or sharing together so not looking for a unicorn or swinging party. While minimal contact between each other‚Äôs partners is desired, verification of our situation over a coffee, video, or call is okay.

To be honest I do not know what this arrangement qualifies as within the community but am keen to learn more.

Looking forward to meeting with compatible  partners, if you have any questions do not hesitate to ask!‚Äù",1,1759452504.0,nonmonogamy,1,1.0,False

It's my first time renting an airbnb where the host \[also M, looks to be in his 30s\] is staying on-site - it's a 1 bedroom apartment, where I'll get the bedroom and he'll be sleeping in the living room. Apparently the living room has a screen that he pulls shut to sleep, for some privacy. He's got a bunch of good reviews so it all seems legit.

Anyway - first time as an airbnb guest where the host will be staying on site. I wanted to ask what the etiquette is in shared spaces? His rules say it's a shared bathroom, no cooking in the kitchen but welcome to use it for tea/coffee. And I messaged him to check if I can have breakfast in the kitchen and he said that's fine and that ""it's a chill house"".

Specifically wondering:

* I wake up pretty early - if I'm up before my host is awake (while his living room screen is closed), should I be tiptoeing around if I need to use the kitchen/bathroom?
* Should I be like telling him when I'm leaving/when I'll be home? Assuming I'll have a key as normal.
* What's etiquette like for dress code in shared spaces? e.g. walking from the shower to my room, do I need to get fully dressed in the bathroom or can I just walk out in a towel to get to my room? Given it's pretty close to the beach, do I need to e.g. put on a shirt if I'm just chilling at home / if I just walk to the kitchen for a coffee, if it's hot or if I've just returned from the beach?",2,1759452309.0,AskMen,2,1.0,False

I (m26) was sharing an apartment with two other roommates, Mike (m23) and Cameron (m24).
I'd known Mike since we were both in Middle School. He had been one my younger brothers best friends for a long time. 
We both met Cameron while working second shift at a factory near our hometown. He was, and is  still a really great guy. Years later, I would be one of his groomsmen.
I was freshly divorced and looking for an apartment, Cameron was coming off a breakup, and Mike's current roommate was moving in with his girlfriend. The the three of us could find a better place than any two of us together, and so we did.  And that's how I started 2 years of the best roommate experience of my life.  
We all worked a lot of hours, so we had a lot of fun on our off time. A lot of Tony Hawk, a lot of Big Lebowski, and a lot of Saturday night's hosting the party after Karaoke at the corner bar.
Looking back, I can proudly say we weren't creeps, and because of that, and we always had a lot of female friends there. Our place is always clean. We always had towels and soap in our guest bathroom. We had good music, snacks, something to drink, and usually a little weed. It was less of a hookup vibe, and more of a hangout vibe.
Because we maintained a friendly vibe is part of is why shortly after she turned 21, I was comfortable inviting my little sister, Kelly, to one of our outings. After all, she'd known Mike for years, and Cameron had quickly become a close friend.  I trusted my newly legal drinking age sister around my roommates. It didn't matter that my sister was a 5'9 blonde midwestern bombshell and part time model. (Who did spend the rest of her time doing her normal job) It didn't matter if she was a awesome person with an infectious laugh. These are my close friends. Who could I trust, if not them? 

I feel it is necessary to tell you at this point in the story, that this story has a happy ending. No one suffered long-term anguish, drama, or awkwardness. My confession is in turning my naivete into a Jedi mind trick.  Even after 25 years,  I've never told the people involved what I did. 

One particular Saturday night, I called it an evening before some of our guests had left, including that night, my sister Kelly. She and her friend were still playing euchre (midwest, remember) with Mike and another one of my brothers friends that I had inherited, Meyers. Meyers was our constant 4th. 
(A side story about this guy so you know how cool he is. He worked as a carpet cleaner, and the company he worked for had a contract with our apartment complex, so he had a set of master keys. Sometimes we would get home from work and find all of our carpets professionally cleaned, and a note on our table that says thank you for letting him smoke out in our apartment, next to a freshly packed bowl on the coffee table)

That next morning, because I went to bed first I woke up first. Meyers was asleep on the couch. He stirred as I was making coffee and turning on the PlayStation 2.  After calling next on Tony Hawk, he told me that Mike and my sister ended up making out.
'Really?!', I asked. 
'Yup'
'They go upstairs?', I asked, because all of our bedrooms are on the second floor. 
Meyers told me no. He walked into the kitchen and saw then making out, but they didn't see him before he quickly backed out. He said Kelly left about 20 minutes later.
I thanked him for telling me, told him I wasn't mad at anybody, it just was a little weird. We then continued to try to grind the ceiling rail on the Warehouse level.
Mike wasn't a bad guy. He was a good friend, but would make a bad boyfriend. She was a 21 year old college student, he was a 24-year-old binge drinker who had a good enough job to have irresponsible disposable income and parents who still paid his car payment. 

Hours later when Mike woke up and joined us in the living room he was acting a little weird. Whenever he was nervous he wouldn't make eye contact and he'd get real jittery. After what Meyers told me about him making out with my sister it made sense. 
He and I start playing NBA 2K, and he relaxes a bit but I realize he's kind of twisting in the wind. He doesn't know if I know. 
I don't know why I did what I did next. I don't know where the idea came from, but as we're playing, I say:

'Dude, it was cool having my sister here last night. I'm really glad that I can bring her around and trust you guys. I wouldn't bring her to some of buddy's places, but it's cool to bring her here.'

To his credit, he played it well. 
'Man, I've known your sister since I was 12 years old. You never have to worry about her here'

'I know, man, but I do appreciate it.' I tell him. 
We keep playing, and he starts getting nervous again. Nervous enough that I end up winning, and he usually whoops me at this game. I'm smiling inside. I feel I've diffused the situation, and psychologically discouraged further indiscretion. 
Wait a minute, did I do the Jedi mind trick? 
Did I just wave my hand in front of my roommate and telling my sister was not the girlfriend he was looking for?

Later that day, my sister calls me. We're close, but not 'talk to you on consecutive days' close. Usually she would have a reason to call, but she was calling to see how I was feeling since I've gone to bed early. 
I was getting the same vibe from my sister as I was getting from Mike earlier. I started to grin, and started waving my hand in a circle. I was going to try the Jedi mind trick again.

'You know sis, I I had so much fun with you and the guys last night. It's really cool to hang out with you as an adult, and I'm just glad the guys I room with are gentleman and I don't have to worry about them being creepy. I feel safe bringing you to my home, and that means a lot. 

She immediately jumped in to say how nice both Mike and Cameron were, and how she's known Mike since she was in third grade. And how much of a good time we did have, and that we should do it again soon. 

My sister came around and hung out with us many more times. As far as I know, those two never made out again. None of the people involved have ever heard this story. I think there's a lot of versions of this story that end in arguments and broken friendships, and I'm happy that this isn't one of them. This may be the most devious I've ever been, but I like to think it was for all the right reasons.

Like really in public, in a cafe. I sat at Blue Bottle from 7am to 1pm with a sign on my laptop that read ‚Äúcoffee on me for valuable feedback.‚Äù It worked, people smiled, and I met a lot of interesting folks, including investors and founders. I have a post from this morning with an image of how it looked, I can share if you ask for it, I cannot attach it here. This is what I learned:

**Timeline:**

* 7:00 to 9:00 quiet time, a few good chats
* around 9:00 biggest rush, I could not keep up with follow-ups and quick demos
* 10:45 to 12:15 dead time
* 12:15 to 13:00 rush again
* left at 13:00 when the battery died

**Numbers:**

* 121 people looked at the sign, only the ones I noticed and counted. Possibly it was 2 to 3 times higher.
* 17 conversations, about 25 people total since some came in pairs
* 14 new LinkedIn and Twitter connections
* 3 VCs connections
* 3 founder connections
* 0 coffees bought by me

**Conversion**

17 conversations out of 121 sign views, about 14 percent. I likely missed many glances, if real views were closer to twice that, call it around 7 to 8 percent. Also, it helps if you notice and start the conversation first, then people approach you. I think 3 VCs is very good number. will see how it goes from here.

What it felt like in practice, I was sitting on the other side of the register, facing it, so many people ordered first, then while they waited for their coffee, they noticed the sign and maybe we talked. Lots of mobile pickup, many did not stop. Sign placement was not ideal, you had to turn from the deck to see it, but it was still the best seat I could get. Net result, it was a very productive time, even though actual coding was tough during the rush. If you try this, please buy something from the cafe, and if you stay long, consider buying more than once. I asked the staff if the sign was okay, and they said it was totally fine, so big thanks to this cafe.

Now I am at home to keep building my startup. Good luck to anyone building or fundraising out there!

I spent an hour and a half setting up his new computer for him. It was a simple enough task, made slightly tedious only by the fact that people his age tend to thing passwords aren't things worth writing down and remembering. All in all, though I hardly regret the time spent especially given how happy he is to have a new laptop. His last one was near broken in half; I didn't even know you could do that to a laptop and still be able to use it.

Anyway, I am pleased to say that we are finally done introducing the husbands. I am not entirely satisfied with that section but it is done enough for me to move along which at this point is the true goal. I wrote 477 words in the manuscript and then had to go and write 408 words of outline. The danaides are difficult to write because there are so many of them if I am spontaneous with their dialogue I takes forever for me to decide who does and says what. Plotting it out in detail is the only way to do it. I do now have a better idea of where I am going to end this chapter off now. It is going to be before my original outline for this chapter even begins so things did get a little mess but not for no good reason. I only two or three small scenes/sections left and this it is done. We have four chapters left.

I haven't ordered what I need to finish the sculpture yet but I will soon. I find myself in no great rush to market Midnight Whorrors. Maybe I'll find myself in another fervor soon but for now, I am occupied with my other stories. The book is out. It is out of my hands whether anybody wants it. I'll try to draw people in which I have it in me but at the same time, it just is not my specialty to creep around social media begging for scraps. Not to say it is beneath me. It just is not me, unfortunately.

Anyway, I am going to relax for the night and see when my imagination takes me. I think I deserve to do while away the evening daydreaming with my evening coffee.

The first is mainly focus on conical grinder. 

The effect of stacking height (the column of the beans above the grinder) , the RPM and the feeding mechanism (slow feed, hot start, cold start) is experimented and found there is no general trend or correlation that can be applicable for every grinder. This mean that maybe slow feeding will generate ""better"" result for higher rpm for the grinder but not optimal when having a slow rpm.

Summary; TLDR for the long post is that not just because a technique is a ""hype"" means it will work for all situation. It just means that feed kinetics should be ""matched"" with burrs dynamics to have optimum results.

1nwkigv,https://www.reddit.com/r/patentexaminer/comments/1nwkigv/you_will_survive/,You Will Survive,"Dear Friends,

Every day seems to have more bad news in the inbox. And today was especially tough.

The atmosphere around the Office has shifted, and not in a direction that most of us would have chosen. There is uncertainty and anxiety. There are new policies that don‚Äôt make sense, and an overall sense that the place we once felt proud of is slipping away from what it used to be.

But I want you to pause for a moment and remember who you are.

Almost every one you came from a science or engineering background. That wasn‚Äôt easy. You sat through brutal classes, endless problem sets, labs that ran past midnight, and exams that tested not just your knowledge but your will to keep going. You watched people around you drop out, change majors, or walk away ‚Äî not because they weren‚Äôt smart, but because the road was hard, and staying on it demanded something extra.

You had that something. You *have* it still.

It‚Äôs easy, in times like these, to feel like everything is slipping out of your hands. But here‚Äôs the truth: you‚Äôve already proven that you can survive tough times and long nights. You made it. You chose civil service. You have promoted innovation and American ingenuity.

What is happening now is just another test: one of perseverance, of unity, of keeping your head when the environment around you is chaotic. And while we may not be able to control the decisions coming from above, we *can* control how we respond. We can help each other. We can look out for the person next to us. We can remember that this moment ‚Äî frustrating, disheartening, and even infuriating as it may be ‚Äî will eventually pass.

Administrations come and go. We stay. Someday, this round of management, with its patenting pending elixir of confusion, bad optics, misguided policies, spite and ineptitude, will be nothing more than a cautionary tale that we tell to the new hires ‚Äî a lesson in resilience, a laugh over coffee, a reminder of how strong we became when things got bad.

There are some promising court decisions at other agencies. Our union is still intact, working to represent us again and to grieve each of these illegal actions.

If you despair, they win. So don‚Äôt give up. Don‚Äôt check out. Don‚Äôt let them get you down.

Keep hope alive. Support each other. And above all, stay the course. You are not alone.

We‚Äôve got this together.

With respect and belief in every one of you,

Had to split into two because the story exceeded the character limit.

[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nuxtdu/something_keeps_waking_me_up_one_minute_before_my/)

The morning after dinner at Chris and Tina‚Äôs, I could have sworn the thumping noise was back, but again, I found no trace of anything. It ate away at me all day.

In what I would have considered a cardinal sin, I brought my phone to bed with me that night and set a notification for five minutes before my alarm. I set it under my pillow so I would feel the vibration and wake up with minimal sounds. Next to it, I placed a kitchen knife, the largest I had. I dreaded thinking I‚Äôd have to use it to stab someone in the face. Somehow, I eventually got to sleep.

The buzz jerked me awake. I twitched slightly, then gained consciousness and stayed still. Slowly, I put my hand under my pillow and grasped the knife. Over pain filled minutes, I inched it slowly towards my side. My breath grew more ragged as my back and hips tensed as I tried to stay still.

Something moved in the room. Under the edge of my sleep mask, a shadow moved in front of the window, which had the previously closed shades now open. My breath caught in my throat. The shadow stopped. Eyes fell on me. In a flash, footsteps exploded across the wood floor. I ripped off my sleep mask and clutched the knife desperately as I struggled to get out of my blankets.

The window in front of my bed made me stop. Trees and underbrush created a dark silhouette, orange sun creating the curtain in the foreground.

There was a set of large glowing eyes looking at me. Silvery sheen glossed the pair, unblinking, unmoving. The thin veiled security of my window vanished.

As the sunlight got brighter and the silhouetting started to vanish, the eyes blinked out. The forest didn‚Äôt move as they did. I stayed in bed and watched until daylight took its full effect.

I swept my grandparents‚Äô house with knife in hand. What was I supposed to do? Call the police? Call park rangers? A sinking feeling told me they‚Äôd find as much as they did searching for Leo.

I didn‚Äôt leave the house all day. I called in sick to work. I double checked, triple checked the locks. I grabbed some shelf stable food and barricaded myself in my room. Who could I call? Chris? He would believe me, right?

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù He sounded confused.

‚ÄúChris! There‚Äôs something outside my house.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? What is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know! Something with glowing eyes! Something was in my house too!‚Äù

‚ÄúIn your house?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn my room!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my gosh‚Ä¶Are you ok?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, I‚Äôm not hurt.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk. Do you need somewhere to stay tonight? Tina and I have a guest room.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶Yeah‚Ä¶I think that would be for the best. Can‚Ä¶Can you come pick me up?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course. Tina and I will be there as soon as we close for the afternoon. Is that ok? You‚Äôll be safe until then?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think so.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk. Call me if anything happens. I‚Äôll let you know when we‚Äôre on the way. It‚Äôs slow today, so we‚Äôll close early.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get through this, Abby.‚Äù

‚ÄúI hope so.‚Äù

I spent the rest of the afternoon grabbing essentials and stuffing them into a bag with one hand as I held the knife with the other. It felt like ages before I saw Chris‚Äôs car pull up in the driveway where he and Tina got out and escorted me to the car.

We didn‚Äôt speak on the short ride to their house, but once we got inside, we sat in their living room, and I recounted everything from the beginning. My heart was beating in my ears as I relived the moment. Afterwards, they led me down a short hallway to their guest room at the back of the house. The forest glared in at me from the glass door to the backyard as we passed.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôs secure,‚Äù said Chris. ‚ÄúSorry that there‚Äôs a window facing the forest.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôd be more comfortable sleeping in the living room you can,‚Äù said Tina.

‚ÄúNo, I think the less windows the better. Thanks. I‚Äôll just draw the blinds and curtains,‚Äù I said.

The room ad a full-size bed, an end table, a chair, and a dresser. No closet. There was a lamp on the end table and a ceiling fan with antlers on it giving light.

I spent the rest of the day in the living room and kitchen with Tina. She was kind enough to make me my favorite meal and some tea while asking me questions about light subjects, like my breakup and life in Portland. The rage at my ex distracted me well enough.

Chris was outside, circling, double-checking doors, windows, and even the roof. Nothing would have gotten in. He even nailed my window shut.

By the end of a large dinner with a few drinks, I was getting sleepy. Intent on not ruining the spirits of Chris and Tina, I staved off sleep for thirty minutes before I started my bedtime routine. We talked and lounged by the fire, and I eventually felt good enough to start my routine.

Tina accompanied me, both for not wanting me to feel alone and a fascination with how meticulous I was. When I finally got into bed, they both checked the room, and then shut the lights off. Surrogate parents were tucking me in. I fell asleep with the feeling that tomorrow might be a normal day.

I woke to pale moonlight streaming through my window. I sat up slightly, sleep mask having fallen off, and blinked as my eyes adjusted to the darkness. Dark trees were silhouetted by the moon outside. The light reflected off branches and needles.

A dark figure stood next to the window‚Ä¶Chris?

No, it wasn‚Äôt Chris. The hair was too long and dark.

My hand clutched under the mattress for the knife I hid without Chris or Tina knowing. The handle was cold, and I whipped it in front of me as I sat up further, pointing it at the figure.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy friends wanted to watch you, Abby.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho are you? How do you know my name?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, Abby. I won‚Äôt let them hurt you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúVery silly friends. Silly, silly forest friends.‚Äù

The figure took a step forward into the moonlight. It was a man. His hair was dark and twisted. His clothes looked like they were the wrong size. He held a short blade in his right hand, and a small, tattered book in his left. His eyes glowed bluish silver. He smiled at me.

‚ÄúLeo?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy friends won‚Äôt be very happy that you saw me. But that‚Äôs ok. It can be our little secret.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? Leo, what are you talking about? Is it really you?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt want you to see me so I had to run away. But I always hoped you might wake up.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho are they?

‚ÄúLook.‚Äù He turned to the window. ‚ÄúSome night they want to meet you. Maybe tonight.‚Äù

I shifted in bed so that I could see the window clearer. There, like hundreds of little moons, were dozens of silvery eyes scattered throughout the forest. Unblinking. Looking at me. I felt see-through. My breath caught in my throat. My heart felt like a bomb going off.

‚ÄúDo you want to meet them?‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt speak.

‚ÄúCome meet them. They‚Äôre friends.‚Äù He held out his hand, but my eyes were still fixed on the forest. ‚ÄúWe can live in a treehouse forever. Do you still have your pocket knife? I do.‚Äù He pointed the blade toward me. ‚ÄúSee?‚Äù It drew my focus from outside.

‚ÄúPlease- don‚Äôt- point that at me.‚Äù I whispered.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go see them.‚Äù His eyes glowed.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I squeaked.

‚ÄúWe should go see them.‚Äù His voice was like the day he disappeared.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I recoiled from him and moved back on the bed.

He jumped forward and grabbed my wrist. I lost my grip on the knife, and it tumbled over the edge of the bed.

I kicked him off me. He stumbled backward, then grabbed my ankle. He pulled me off the edge of the bed. I landed hard on my lower spine, waves of pain shooting through my body. His grip tightened on my ankle. I flipped onto my stomach and grabbed one of the bed legs, but my fingers slipped. I cried out as Leo took heavy footsteps, dragging me down the hallway.

‚ÄúCome on, Abby!‚Äù

I grabbed the door frame, arms fully stretched, muscles straining as the tension in my whole body skyrocketed. Leo‚Äôs fingernails dug deeper into my ankle. I felt blood run down my leg.

The doorframe gave way and wrenched from the wall. I screamed as Leo pulled me toward the side door. Through the glass pane, I saw the flash of hundreds more eyes.

As he reached for the doorknob, a shadow slammed into Leo. With a howl, Chris punched Leo several times, pulling him away from my leg. I scrambled back towards my room on all fours then turned to see a silver glint in the moonlight. Leo raised the knife and swung. Chris held up his arm, eating a slash on the wrist. He grunted and scrambled back as Leo swung again. Leo lunged at Chris, who sidestepped and tried to grab the knife, but Leo kicked him against the wall to the floor. Chris scrambled back against the wall, and Leo stepped forward to finish him.

A glass hit the side of Leo‚Äôs head, and he stumbled as it shattered. Tina threw again as he threw his hands up. Chris leapt to his feet and tackled Leo through the glass door. They hit the ground with a thud, then groaned and laid in the moonlight.

Tina and I rushed to the now broken door and pulled Chris back inside. Leo had gone still. We turned to look while avoiding the broken glass. Just as Tina fished her phone out of her pocket, she froze.

‚ÄúOh my god‚Ä¶the eyes.‚Äù

The forest was full of them. Glowing. Unblinking. No sound pierced the night. No shadow wavered in the moonlight. We couldn‚Äôt look away.

Leo stirred, laying in the shattered glass just beyond the lip of the roof. He sat up, eyes confused as they met mine.

‚ÄúAbby‚Ä¶they‚Äôre friends.‚Äù Sadness pooled in his voice.

Two long arms, blacker than the night sky, reached down from above the roof. An indeterminate amount of fingers gripped his shoulders. Leo‚Äôs body lifted off the ground. As he glanced up with a look of contentment, a shadow extended from the roof across the patio and into the forest. The arms pulled him into the forest silently. The shadow disappeared after him.

All at once, the eyes vanished. The sound of thousands of footsteps raced away through the forest until the silence of the night returned. Only our ragged breath remained.

Tina called 911. The police and paramedics patched me and Chris, then took statements. There wasn‚Äôt really anything they could do.

I moved back to Portland the next week. The goodbye to Chris and Tina was brief, as we were all still shaken. Chris stopped selling plushies at the coffee shop, and I think they might have sold it and moved as well. I haven‚Äôt really kept up with them.

I‚Äôm doing fine now. Making new friends has been good, and I have enough from selling the cabin to get back on my feet.

The only thing that still bothers me is my sleep schedule. I keep waking up one minute before my alarm goes off, no matter what time it‚Äôs set for. Most days it‚Äôs fine, but sometimes, I swear I can hear footsteps thumping on the floorboards.",1,1759450402.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

My mind raced before I even opened my eyes, replaying mistakes, whispering doubts, making me feel like I wasn‚Äôt enough. I tried coffee, scrolling my phone, endless to-do lists‚Ä¶ nothing worked.

Then one day, I decided to try something tiny. Just two minutes. I closed my eyes and focused on one thought I wanted to carry through the day. That‚Äôs all.

And somehow, it changed everything. My mornings feel calmer. My thoughts feel softer. I notice myself being kinder; to myself, and to the people around me.

It‚Äôs such a small habit, but over time, it quietly shifted the way I move through my life.

*Do you have a tiny morning ritual that helps you start your day feeling calm and grounded? I‚Äôd love to hear what keeps your mornings peaceful. üåø*

I have never done this but I have been losing sleep over this awful decision for weeks i need advice on how to start this conversation with her. 
Okay so we started dating when we were 15 and 16 and have been together ever since. she is the girl ive lost my virginity to and really the only woman ive been in a serious relationship with. we went to different colleges after high school and did long distance for all 4 of those years. it was definitely challenging and some trying times but we always made it work and after she graduated we moved in together while i finished my last year of school. We get along really really well and there is no question in mind she is my best friend. We haven‚Äôt had a serious argument in a long time and genuinely coexist really well living together. 
For context we are both working some pretty stressful jobs (healthcare) but there has been a severe lack of intimacy and emotional connection for sometime i feel. We have now lived with eachother for 2.5 years and to be honest I would have a really hard time finding more than 2 or 3 months where we had sex more often than like once every 2 weeks. i feel over the past 6 months things have gotten much worse. Due to the nature of our relationship she was expecting an engagement after i graduated college and so I bought a ring and proposed 2 months thinking that would help to take our relationship to the ‚Äúnext level‚Äù welllllll things have gotten worse. We have had sex twice in the past two months and it is not for lack of effort on my part.
 I am objectively a decent looking guy and have always been told that. I do a good job with hygiene, dressing nice, always stay pretty well groomed, do skincare stuff. I also definitely do more of the housework than she does because i prefer a cleaner living space so i frequently ‚Äúsurprise her‚Äù after a long week of work with cleaning the apartment or putting new sheets on our bed. I will also do things like go out and get us coffee and breakfast and bring it back to our apartment on a weekend or ask her if she wants to go to one of her favorite stores and go shopping stuff like that. I am always complimenting her and doing things like grabbing her bum, trying to kiss her, making her feel good about her body and letting her know that sexually that charge is still there for me. And I think the final point ill use to drive home the fact that i feel like I am really good partner her mom frequently tells her how lucky she is ‚Äúto have found a good one‚Äù and when i went to ask her to propose she stopped me before i could get the words out and said it would be an honor for you to join our family. 
Okay with all that being said our relationship has progressed to us genuinely feeling like roommates. I dont feel like shes excited to see me when i get home, or hear about my day or really care what‚Äôs going on with me. I have for years expressed to her how important it is for me to know she is attracted to me and how i look for intimacy to be pretty 50/50 in terms of who is initiating it. Well things will change for a month and then go back to normal. 
This has been going on for some time but what is scaring me the most is I have noticed myself subconsciously not caring about it anymore. Like I dont wish to use the energy to change how poorly the relationship is going anymore. That scares me that I am starting to check out and I have noticed myself starting to reciprocate her feelings. So i guess this is the advice im looking for how do i bring this up to her? i owe her a conversation before i just break things off. remember we have literally grown together and she is all i know but i am terrified that if it keeps going down this path 8 years in.. where will it be in 15 years? 30??

1nwkb15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseitzone/comments/1nwkb15/emotional_eating_how_to_understand_it_and_deal/,Emotional Eating: How to Understand It and Deal With It,"Many people find themselves eating without actually being hungry. The issue isn‚Äôt the food itself, but rather the relationship we build with it. When we feel stressed, anxious, overwhelmed by work, family, or responsibilities, our brain looks for something quick to comfort us. And often, that comfort is found in food.

This is what we call emotional eating.
In these moments, eating isn‚Äôt a response to physical hunger, but a way to escape from negative emotions: stress, boredom, anxiety, or even loneliness.

The problem is that emotional eating only provides temporary relief. Afterwards, we often feel guilt, heaviness, or regret‚Äîand the same cycle repeats again.

üîπ So, what can we do to break this cycle?
	1.	Awareness of the problem
The first step is to pause and ask yourself: ‚ÄúAm I really hungry, or am I just trying to escape stress?‚Äù This small question can wake you up and make you think before reaching for food.
	2.	Healthier alternatives for comfort
	‚Ä¢	Drink a glass of water or a warm tea.
	‚Ä¢	Try the ‚Äú5-4-3-2-1‚Äù grounding technique: notice 5 things you see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste (it doesn‚Äôt have to be a big snack).
	‚Ä¢	Replace eating with another sensory comfort: smell something nice (like coffee or essential oil), or take a short warm shower.
	3.	Take personal time in the middle of the chaos
Even if your day is full of responsibilities, you need a moment just for yourself: 10 minutes of music, journaling, or simply sitting in silence. These small breaks can give you a sense of control without turning to food.
	4.	Prepare your environment
If you only keep chocolate and sweets within reach, it‚Äôs natural to crave them. Instead, prepare healthier snacks in advance: cut-up fruit, a small portion of nuts, or plain yogurt. Make them more available than tempting foods.
	5.	Forgive yourself
You won‚Äôt always succeed in stopping emotional eating. And that‚Äôs okay. When it happens, it‚Äôs not the end of the world. Simply being aware of the problem and learning from each experience is already huge progress.

‚ú® Remember: the goal isn‚Äôt to deprive yourself of food, but to find other ways to reconnect with your body and calm your mind‚Äîwithout always relying on eating.

I mostly do V60, cold brew for my wife, and the occasional Aeropress. 

The other day it stopped turning on at all, so I took it apart and found that if I shorted the timer circuit, it worked fine. However, the thing was FULL of old grinds, covering the PCB and everything else inside. So, I‚Äôm taking this as my sign to upgrade. 

It seems like the Ode Gen 2 is a popular/safe choice, and around the max I would want to spend, so I‚Äôm pretty confident that‚Äôs what I will get. I‚Äôm not planning to get too crazy with coffee as a hobby, so I don‚Äôt think something like a Timemore Sculptor is in the running. 

Of course, I‚Äôd really like to just buy one today, but I saw that these sometimes go on sale during Prime Days, and there are a couple coming up next week. Anyone know if that‚Äôs pretty much a given that they‚Äôll be on sale? And when they do go on sale at Amazon, does Fellow discount them as well? I want a deal but I‚Äôd rather buy direct if I can. 

Finally, are there any other similarly-priced grinders to watch out for that might go on sale, that could be as good as or better than the Ode?",2,1759449281.0,pourover,7,1.0,False

One of the most memorable moments was hiking on a glacier. It was strenuous, but absolutely worth it. I‚Äôd do it again in a heartbeat (next time with fewer layers ‚Äî I was overdressed!).

In Reykjav√≠k, we made a stop at the famous Rainbow Road, which is even more vibrant in person than in pictures. The city itself is cozy and colorful, with coffee shops and street art tucked everywhere.

And of course, the geothermal pools at The Blue Lagoon ‚Äî soaking in the hot water while surrounded by steam and volcanic landscapes is unlike anything else. Yes, get the upgrade for a robe, extra face masks and drinks!

1nwk0lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1nwk0lg/cut_off_from_stimulants/,Cut off from stimulants,"About a year ago I tried Concerta, at the lowest dose as my first stimulant ever. It made an instant difference in my productivity and executive functioning, while also improving my social functioning. But it made me very irritable and heightened my anxiety at times. But what made me stop was the palpitations and elevated heart rate. It got so bad once that it just wouldn't stop and it felt like my heart was going to pound out of my chest, and that's when I called it quits and got scared off of stimulants for a while and was fully off meds from then.

A few months ago I realized I just couldn't function without any ADHD medication and so my psychiatrist put me on Wellbutrin. It helped very slightly for a few days until it just stopped working and gave me severe brain fog, so I stopped after about a month.

I decided to try a different stimulant to see if I might react better. My psychiatrist prescribed me the lowest dose of Focalin. And it was amazing. Improved focus compared to Concerta, without the elevated irritability and anxiety. It also improved my social functioning too, made me more talkative (I'm the inattentive type who usually doesn't talk much). It also improved my mood and overall just made me more excited for life. It was a lifechanger. Genuinely a perfect medication for me in all areas except one:

I soon started getting some palpitations again. Then about a week in I started experiencing mild (but definitely there) chest pains. When I told my psychiatrist, they refused to prescribe any more until I see a cardiologist. I can't get a cardiology appointment until January. 

I'm only four days off of Focalin and my functioning has tanked. I'm back at my barely functional state. I don't know how I managed to live like this my whole life. I don't want to live like this. I don't know how I'll be able to finish school and hold a job like this. It takes all the time and energy I have to get even simple tasks done. I have no social life or free time. Not because I am particularly busy but because of the amount of time it takes me to do basic things. It makes me want to cry, especially when I think of how much better I was able to function on the stimulants. It was a night and day difference.

Just a low dose of a stimulant gave me such a massive improvement in my quality of life. It allowed me to access a part of myself I can never access off of it. It genuinely made me feel more alive. And to experience that miracle and then have it ripped away is devastating. It genuinely feels like that Flowers for Algernon story. I saw what my life could be for a brief time only to lose it.

I know there are non-stimulants and I will probably start Strattera or something in the meantime while I wait for a cardiology appointment. But nothing has ever helped me quite like stimulants. They really do feel like the missing piece I need to be a fully functioning and alive human being, and every other medication can at best only bring me to an imprecise and highly inferior imitation of what stimulants do for me

I'm worried I won't be able to ever safely use stimulants. I don't have any known heart issues but I can't even go on the lowest doses of methylphenidates without worrying cardiac effects. Even coffee gives me palpitations. So I do genuinely worry about stimulants causing me to drop dead one day. But at the same time, I don't want to live the way I do without stimulants",1,1759449130.0,ADHDers,0,1.0,False

Lily wiped down the counter at the Willow Creek Diner, humming along to classic rock that crackled through ancient speakers. Something felt... *off* today. The coffee machine sputtered a dark sludge that smelled faintly of gasoline, and Hank from Table 4 left a vintage Mustang keychain as his tip‚Äî**engraved with initials she didn‚Äôt recognize**.

Then the radio hissed to life mid-song:  
  
***""‚Äîlocal woman reported missing after her ‚Äò73 Plymouth was found abandoned near Old Mine Road‚Äî""***

The date on the receipt? **June 14, 1972.**

Lily wiped down the counter of the Willow Creek Diner for what felt like the hundredth time that shift. The ‚Äò70s rock playing through the staticky speakers had started to warp‚Äîsome notes stretched too long, like a warped record.  



‚ÄúOrder up!‚Äù The cook slid a greasy plate across the pass-through. Something was‚Ä¶ off about it tonight. The patty looked \*grayer\* than usual, and when she picked it up, her fingers came away slick with an oil that smelled faintly of gasoline.  



She didn‚Äôt mention it to Hank at Table 4‚Äîhe just grinned around his burger, teeth too white under flickering fluorescents that hadn‚Äôt worked right in weeks (\*or had they always buzzed like this?\*). His keys jangled as he left: \*\*a Mustang keychain with chipped red paint.\*\*  



That should‚Äôve been her first warning.  



The flat tire came twenty minutes later on Route 9‚Äîjust past where GPS cut out and road signs bled into symbols she didn‚Äôt recognize (\*Were those mile markers or dates?\*). A figure moved between pines where no one should be walking‚Ä¶ then vanished behind a curtain of radio static screaming:  

\*\*\*‚ÄúSHELBY GT500 REPORTED STOLEN‚Äî‚Äù\*\*\* before cutting dead. 



And there it sat beneath peeling birches: \*\*A ‚Äò67 Shelby Cobra\*\*, cherry red under layers of grime (\*too pristine for how long those vines gripped its wheels\*). When Lily touched the hood‚Äîstill warm despite weeks (years?) abandoned here‚Äîthe door groaned open on its own‚Ä¶ exhaling air thick with aftershave and gunpowder (\*\*scents from ‚Äô72 newspaper clippings about missing hunters\*\*). 



Inside? A half-empty coffee cup (\*\*lipstick not hers\*\*) still steaming next to unfolded maps leading nowhere modern roads existed anymore... until headlights flashed behind her mirrorless rearview showing only darkness grinning back through glass cracked exactly like police photos from last winter's unexplained wreck (\*hadn't Officer Dan said something about ‚Äúdriver vanished mid-drive‚Äù?\*)...   



Too late now though; engine growling alive beneath fingertips already remembering steering wheel grooves worn smooth by hands much larger than hers (‚Äò73 mechanic James Holt listed MIA after complaining his garage lock kept jamming‚Ä¶) as pavement dissolved beneath tires spinning threads between timelines where diner uniforms changed color overnight while coworkers aged backwards smiling emptier

  
After Clocking out of Work Lily Started her Commute Home Honda broke down where GPS failed‚Äîright by a dirt road that hadn‚Äôt existed yesterday. And there it was: A ***‚Äò67 Shelby Cobra*** parked in a clearing like it had been waiting for her (*hadn't she seen this car in old police reports under ""unsolved disappearances""?*). The engine was still warm when she touched it. Inside? A newspaper on the passenger seat (**dated July ‚Äò72**) circled listings for mechanics who all went missing months apart.

Lily Being The Car Enthusiast she is figured it's abandoned nobody's gonna mind 

When Lily turned the ignition, headlights cut through fog revealing *no road anymore*. Just endless pines and billboards advertising businesses demolished decades ago‚Ä¶ until her phone buzzed with texts from coworkers asking where she went during lunch (*three hours ago*)‚Äîeven though only five minutes had passed.

Lily was about to text back, but her phone shut down

As she was driving to the DMV to get the Shelby registered a cop pulled her over as he approached he looked to be in a state of a mix of fright and confusion 

The cop‚Äôs flashlight beam cut through the rain as he tapped her window. ‚ÄúLicense and registration, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

Lily handed them over, fingers shaking‚Äînot from fear, but from the icy *wrongness* in his voice. His nametag read **‚ÄúOFFICER DAN HARKER - WILLOW CREEK PD‚Äù**, but she‚Äôd seen that name before‚Ä¶ on a **1972 missing persons poster** in the diner break room.

He ran the VIN, squinting at his screen. ‚ÄúHuh.‚Äù A pause too long to be natural. ***‚ÄúSays this car was crusher-fodder back in ‚Äò72 after a fatal wreck.‚Äù*** Rain dripped off his hat like slow-moving bugs as he leaned closer‚Äîclose enough for Lily to see where his collar gaped open‚Ä¶ revealing **rope burns around his neck.**

*Oh God.* Because now she remembered: Officer Dan had been *one of Willow Creek‚Äôs first victims.* Found hanged in that same Shelby with its windshield shattered (*just like hers was now*) and its seats soaked through with something darker than rainwater (**something still sticky when you touched it fifty years later**)...

And then came static‚Äîthe kind that ate radios whole‚Äîas Dan smiled without teeth:  
  
***""Y'know... they never found your body either.""***

fast forward a week later

Lily gasped as the Shelby's headlights illuminated the highway patrol car‚Äîthe *same* one that had pulled her over last week. The same officer stepped out, his badge glinting under moonlight that shouldn't have been full tonight.

His hand rested on his holster as he approached. ""License and registration, ma'am."" His voice crackled like an old recording. When Lily handed over her ID, his flashlight beam passed right through her trembling fingers like they were made of smoke.

The radio on his belt squawked:  
  
***""All units be advised... missing person case #1972-045... female driver matching description...""***

A static-choked photo slid from his folder‚Äîa mugshot of *her*, dated **July 18, 1972**. Below it, a coroner's stamp: **""Presumed deceased (vehicular disappearance).""**

Officer Dan didn't react when she screamed. Just tilted his head‚Äîtoo far, like a puppet with cut strings‚Äîand said:  
  
*""Welcome to Willow Creek Permanent Detour, Miss Cooper. Population: you... and them.""*

Behind him stretched an endless line of abandoned cars (**'78 Pontiac... '89 Bronco... 2023 Honda Civic**) parked along roads that hadn't existed in decades. Inside each one sat shadowy figures clutching steering wheels forever frozen mid-turn.

Then the Shelby's engine roared alive on its own (*hungry for its next passenger*) as rain began falling ***upside-down*** through memories of a town that forgot daylight.",1,1759448624.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I tried to follow, I was weighed down by a thousand mile view over looking what seemed like forever. The curve of the earth could be seen if looked far enough, if the world deer wanted to look it would just turn its head and look. It was a ball and we were stuck on it. Like glue on a fresh baseball and the hide was just put over us. My feet would carry me so my feet would let it go. My will was broken. It was miles ahead and had been for centries. I gave up. It looked at me, breathed. Washing, dense force; breath carried it's deep infected scent. I was a splinter in a carpenters work shop. Saw dust in the wind; birds. Tile on a uneven floor; foliage. Cracks in the counter; character on the mountains. Squeaky cabnits; the call of nature. Her lips moving to forever and no door. It was trapped in the earth. 
Unless a space ship could pick it up. Unless that thing that made the deer could be picked up. The world deer. Was the earth. It was the cove, ships side to side, waiting for a heading in the blistering sun, the crews skin peeled off like ragged clothes. It's open sails catching wind and resting in the sea, A full moon perched at the end of the water. It's light candle and scene wax. When only to be resting on light washes of sea foam on the sea sand like a foot on the carpet lightly dragging back and forth. and lightning bugs in some humid backroad, cigerettes and dip. Black spit in an old campbell soup can, a rusty sign, and a hand almost in sign language it says cigerete. Or The globe in the hands of a child walking slightly to his right. Wobbling and falling to the floor. An old image of his entire family to that point. New Borns waking up seeing a doctor and mother, a father or brother. Them asking ""Is he okay?"" and cold starts from those frosty desperate nights, like the earth wont stand still, and like the earth wont move. early mornings. Coffee and dountes in the seven eleven bag. Fire ants on the hills outside the carwash. and lonely men who love Cold women dragging cigerettes in the brisk wind. As rain sticks to your flower skin.  Lightning strikes, with soft chilly empty pallets of gray, and black, and flashes of white. Revealing cold rolling dark hills and long shadow wearing trees... And funerals, family Lost in their search of certain material. Lost keys, but not the key itself. The world itself ate itself everyday. The world deer was the world. 
And I was in the world. I was the deer. I start a fire. I start to look. All I saw was the reflection of myself in all that was around me. The purple from a sliver of a painting lost in some pile of leaning paintings hiding behind the white throw burned the night a black hue. The world was on fire. I wish there was another. Like a space ship, or a vehicle of some sort. One that could fly. I was the warmth on the fire. Let me sleep. I smoke so I can't eat myself. It's a curse. This type of life is sprung out of the deer.

I‚Äôd rely on coffee, energy drinks, or just push through the fatigue ‚Äî which usually ended up making me feel worse.

After a lot of trial and error, here‚Äôs what actually helped me stay energized (without crashing):

1. Hydration first thing
I started drinking a full liter of water before even touching coffee. It sounds small, but it prevents that mid-morning dehydration slump.

2. Movement breaks
Every 2‚Äì3 hours, I take a 5‚Äì10 min walk, stretch, or even do a quick breathing exercise. It keeps blood flowing and clears brain fog.

3. Sleep consistency > sleep duration
Even if I couldn‚Äôt get 8 hours, going to bed and waking up at the same time improved my energy more than I expected.

4. Nutrition tweaks
Cutting back on heavy lunches made a huge difference. I switched to lighter meals with more protein and veggies ‚Äî no more post-lunch crash.

5. Supplements (optional but helped me)
I also tried a wellness supplement recently, and it‚Äôs been surprisingly effective at keeping my energy steady throughout long shifts. It‚Äôs not magic, but paired with the other habits, it really helped me.

Not saying this will work for everyone, but it‚Äôs been a game-changer for me. Curious ‚Äî how do you all manage energy during long shifts? Any hacks I should try?",9,1759448367.0,Nightshift,9,1.0,False

She did the same thing with Shannon. First she‚Äôd post about how Shannon was around and she seemed annoyed, then when they stopped talking, she made sure to throw Shannon under the bus. She‚Äôll do the same with Curtis.

Also, why did she call his mom? Or is his mom there? She said he apologized right away and that he ‚Äúnever‚Äù does. But how often is he actually blowing up over coffee‚Ä¶ or other little things?

She said she ‚Äúshut down‚Äù and went upstairs, almost like she‚Äôs implying she‚Äôs over him. Then literally the next clip is them taking J√§ger shots back to back. Like‚Ä¶ what?

This whole relationship just seems so unhealthy. They‚Äôre never really alone together, they sleep apart, and it feels like they constantly surround themselves with other people so they don‚Äôt have to face being alone together. At this point, they‚Äôre completely detached and now he resents her.

It‚Äôs obvious there are serious issues in their marriage. Constantly posting about how ‚Äúhappy‚Äù you are all the time‚Äîand then saying your husband screamed at you over coffee? Yeah‚Ä¶ I dunno.",12,1759448228.0,PerfectlyKelsey_Snark,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a 28-year-old woman who‚Äôs realizing more and more how much I value meaningful, supportive friendships with other women. Lately, I‚Äôve been feeling like something is missing in my life, and I think a big part of it is not having enough strong female connections. I‚Äôd love to find other women around my age (or really any age 20s‚Äì30s) who are also looking for genuine friendships.

A little about me: I‚Äôm the kind of person who really enjoys deep conversations, laughing until my stomach hurts, and being there for the people I care about. I like going out sometimes (grabbing brunch, going for a walk, checking out a new caf√© or event), but I also love cozy nights in where we can watch movies, cook, or just chat about life. I‚Äôm pretty balanced between introvert and extrovert ‚Äî I can be social, but I definitely appreciate downtime.

I‚Äôve noticed how easy it is to end up with ‚Äúconvenience friendships‚Äù ‚Äî people you hang out with because you work together or go to school together, but the connection never really goes beyond surface-level. I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôd rather have a few close, real friends than a whole bunch of acquaintances. I want the kind of friendship where we can cheer each other on, share silly memes, talk about our goals, vent when things are tough, and know that we actually have each other‚Äôs backs.

Some of my interests:
‚Ä¢ I love reading (everything from fiction to self-improvement books).
‚Ä¢ Fitness and wellness are important to me, though I‚Äôm not hardcore about it ‚Äî I just like trying to take care of myself.
‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm a bit of a foodie and love trying out new recipes or restaurants.
‚Ä¢ Mental health and personal growth are big topics for me ‚Äî I think it‚Äôs so important to keep learning about yourself and improving.
‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm also always down for something low-key like walking in the park, having a coffee chat, or even just sharing playlists.

One thing I‚Äôll say is that I‚Äôm not looking for drama, competition, or one-sided relationships. I‚Äôm past the stage of chasing people who don‚Äôt put in effort, and I‚Äôd like to connect with other women who feel the same way. Friendship, to me, is about reciprocity, kindness, and being able to show up as yourself without judgment.
If this resonates with you, I‚Äôd love to chat! Even if we don‚Äôt end up becoming best friends, it would be great to talk and see where things go. And if you‚Äôre reading this and feeling the same way ‚Äî that you‚Äôd like more strong, supportive female friendships in your life ‚Äî then maybe this post was meant for you to see.

Life feels so much richer when you have people to share it with, and I‚Äôm really hoping to find that. So if you‚Äôre also looking for genuine connections, feel free to message me!",0,1759448144.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,0.17,False

The apps just don‚Äôt feel the same anymore, so I thought I‚Äôd give this space a shot. I‚Äôve heard people actually find interesting connections here, and I like the idea of getting to know someone through their words rather than just swiping on pictures. Attraction is important, but the way someone writes and expresses themselves can be just as telling.

What I‚Äôm looking for is something genuine. Ideally, a connection that could grow into a long-term relationship. I believe that takes time, so I‚Äôm happy to start slow ‚Äî chatting, sharing laughs, and building a vibe first. Meeting for coffee, dinner, or a long walk sounds like the right way to start. If we click, who knows where it could lead.

A little about me:
I‚Äôm 34, Pakistani slim/fit (5‚Äô10‚Äù), and I keep active with runs and workouts. I live in downtown Toronto. I‚Äôm clean and hygienic (yes, showers twice a day kind of guy).

I love exploring cultures, learning and speaking languages (I know several and learning more), and diving into conversations about history, art, and media. I enjoy a balance between deep talks and lighthearted fun, and I like to think I can be a little funny too. Writing poetry is something I do often, and I enjoy connecting with people on an authentic, meaningful level.

What I‚Äôd love to find is someone kind, curious, open-minded, and comfortable being themselves. A woman who enjoys conversations, laughter, and slowly building trust and comfort. I‚Äôm not rushing ‚Äî I‚Äôm looking for something real.

If any of this resonates with you, feel free to reach out. Let‚Äôs grab a coffee, share a walk, and see where it goes.

Hello! I am a new user, and I am here to promote the Fantasy Character Creator Toolkit that I've created. This is an experimental digital product I made for my current graduate class.

Do you need a picture of your Dungeons and Dragons character? Are you not super artistically inclined, but can at least use the tools in most drawing programs? Do you just like character creators and characters with horns and tails? Then, this is the product for you!

Welcome to [the Fantasy Character Creator Toolkit, available on BuyMeCoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/nixpendergast/e/463428)! This toolkit features hand-drawn pieces designed to help you create a fantasy character. Inside, you will find two slightly different toolkits, one for male characters and one for female characters. Both versions of the toolkit are available in multiple formats: a Clip Studio Paint file, an Adobe Photoshop file, and a zipped file containing PNGs that can be imported into any program.

Both toolkits contain the same customization options and function in the same manner. DnD races featured in this pack are:

      * Goliaths
      * Orcs
      * Humans
      * Elves
      * Tieflings
      * Dwarves
      * Halflings
      * Gnomes

**This product is free for the first 10 buyers. After that, it will only be $1.**",1,1759447289.0,DnD,0,1.0,False

1nwjahy,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditDads/comments/1nwjahy/the_big_fight/,The big fight,"It‚Äôs another Monday after school around 4:20. I dreaded going to Dad‚Äôs.The texts between Dad made me more annoyed and so I lied again about the bad cramps to keep me from going. As I text, the scratches along the back side of my phone bug me more than usual.
Dad replies, ‚ÄúHey Avery, it‚Äôs been around two weeks, maybe you can come to my house. I really miss you.‚Äù 
Before I could answer, the only thing I hear is Nick's car pulling in with his music louder than ever. I ran downstairs to say hello, opened the door, and the sun blinded me. I gave Nick a smile and he asked if I was coming to dads. 
I didn‚Äôt want to say anything, so I gave him a head nod and started walking to the front seat, Peyton already in the back of the car, smirking at me watching my every move. 
Nick asked me how school is coming along,I said about two more weeks until school is out.

As we pulled into Dad‚Äôs driveway, I felt a dark presence, giving me the chills.  Felt annoyed and angry as I walked to the front door. Nick opened the door for me and Peyton, then two of the happiest dogs ran out the door like wild animals. One with Snowy fur and the other one that looks like muddy brown and some spots on the fur, drool hanging from its lip, barking loudly. As I said hello to Dad, he smiled ear to ear. 
I gave him a hug, irritated to see him. 
He said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to finally see you again.‚Äù 
After greeting my dad I ran and jumped onto the couch, getting cozy and warm. As the smaller dog jumps on top of me.I put my legs on the wooden coffee table, feeling the little imperfections beneath my feet.
Later that night around 6:30, we started to make food. Dad stood up first, to pour himself his first drink of alcohol that I had seen that day in a metal cup, black paint peeling from the top and bottom from use. The rest of us got up to help, then his girlfriend came out of the bedroom. I looked at her and smiled, but everyone gave her a glare.
She introduces herself as Brittany. 
Dad starts to clean the mess of dishes. As everyone else starts to make the food, I cut the beets knowing that my hands will stain the darkest red color. I salt the beet and threw one in my mouth. It was delicious. 
I sat down on the couch with the beets in hand and waited for everyone else to finish in the kitchen. As I waited, the sound of loud side conversations and the music in the background filled my ears. 

Dinner time at 7:30. We sat down, three of us on the couch and the other two on the floor.The coffee table filled to the brim with food and cutlery. Dad sat across from me and Brittany to the left of him. Peyton and Nick sat to my right. We all start to have a beautiful conversation like if we were at a funny sitcom. We had begun to enjoy each other‚Äôs company. I started to be overjoyed that I was there. All of the sudden, it became a cat and dog fight.
Brittany started to talk about something that hurt Peyton.
Brittany said that she had to be better than Peyton at boxing when Brittany had never even done it.
So I told Brittany to keep your mouth to yourself and don't talk to her like that.
Brittany says she had just been messing with her.
I said I am not messing. 
 Dad told me to stop because I was misbehaving. 
But I didn‚Äôt,I just began to become louder. The feeling of my fist clenched from anger. I felt hurt for Peyton and upset that Dad didn‚Äôt do anything. Most of the time he had no problem raising his voice at Brittany in front of us. We all thought it was unhealthy but he did it anyway. He just didn‚Äôt care. I told her harshly to shut up. ‚ÄúThis is why we all don‚Äôt like you. Even your own boyfriend despises you. He yells at you all the time.‚Äù
 Dad yells, ‚Äúyou are the kid. She is older than you. Stop talking now!‚Äù
The feeling of anger dived away and sadness filled those holes fast. I started to cry and felt it run down my cheeks. I ran to the restroom. 

I open the door to the restroom, turn the light on and fall right onto the cool tile floor. Tears running down my face, on my phone, and onto my hands. The warm feeling of the tears always grossed me out. My hands shaking as I texted my best friend Alivia. I tell her everything that happens, making sure not to leave out one detail. 
As I text her I still can hear my family talk in the other room. Alivia tries to calm me down as much as possible. The scratches on the side of my phone are not bothering me now, just my thoughts. 
At 8:00,Alivia gets me to calm down a lot but,I felt upset still but I put my phone down and stood. I opened the door and the door knob had been really loose. I just haven‚Äôt realized it the first time. As I sat on the couch,everyone had been done with dinner for a while to the look of it. My plate was gone too. Nick left the room then everything had gone wrong in less than a minute.
Dad walked up to me. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do that again. That had to be the most ridiculous thing I have seen.‚Äù
Peyton told him to leave me alone for now.
When in the restroom, they had decided that we would be going to the park and play basketball. As we waited he‚Äôd poured him another cup of alcohol. He said just as soon as he‚Äôs done with what he was doing we would leave. 
So I said, ‚ÄúWe will leave when you're done pouring yourself a cup of alcohol. Is that right?‚Äù
 He got mad and yelled, ‚ÄúStop that right now. You're the kid. You don‚Äôt yell at me.‚Äù He walked over to his room. I could feel the way he stomped from the floor. He slammed the door to his room and yelled. ‚Äúwalk home!‚Äù
 So I got up from the couch, opened the door and slammed it shut, the loud noise echoing throughout the house. With tears in my eyes, for the second time today, I walked to the Dollar Tree down the road. 

It‚Äôs 8:30 and I am storming through Dollar Tree. I felt like I needed to sit down, so I walked outside and walked to the curb and sat down. I took a deep breath and closed my eyes. I could feel the cold concrete with little holes beneath my legs.
 Nick‚Äôs car came down the road and he stopped to pick me up. I got in the car and thanked him. 
He said he‚Äôs sorry that dad yelled at me like that, and started to drive me and Peyton home. 
9:00 I arrived home. Nick hugged me and said you and your dad will get over this. You guys are like the same person. That made me upset but I just walked away. I walked into my room,fell on bed, closed my eyes and listened to the sound around me. The AC and the mini fridge in the room made a loud vibration. Layed in bed just collecting my thoughts and texted Dad that I was sorry. I became frustrated and took it out on you. I am so sorry.This time the scratches on my phone gave me comfort.

My story, won‚Äôt call it a horror story because despite being in the worst pain I‚Äôve ever experienced I am doing a million times better and am so grateful I was able to have an abortion. Me and my boyfriend wanted the baby, but we are so broke at the moment it was the only responsible adult option we had. We really tried to make something work, but determined there was no way we could guarantee a baby saftey, or shelter, and we already can hardly feed ourselves. It just seemed irresponsible and selfish to keep it. I was only 6.5 weeks when aborted, but even in that short amount of time pregnancy had taken its toll on my body. I was literally sick the entire time I was pregnant, in those 6 weeks I had a horrible cold that wouldn‚Äôt go away, a respiratory infection, a voice box infection, and a yeast infection. I was so fatigued and nauseous I couldn‚Äôt even get out of bed, my work kept sending me home because of how horrible I looked. I even fell asleep in my chair while working several times. So to make everything even worse I couldn‚Äôt work and everything fell on my boyfriend. When I had the actual abortion the Mifepristone went over well, but when it came time to take the Misoprostol OMG!!! Within 20 minutes, before the pill could even dissolve I was in the most intense pain of my life. It was so bad I passed out from the pain and woke up screaming at the top of my lungs, I immediately went over and vomited. The pain just didn‚Äôt stop and I kept coming in and out of consciousness. I guess at some point when I passed out I shit myself and the poop would just not stop coming out. It was so horrible I was literally 2 seconds away from calling 911, i remember laying there telling myself that I am about to die, and this is how I‚Äôm going to die. The only reason I didn‚Äôt call was because I couldn‚Äôt get any words out without throwing up everywhere and living in Texas I feared the consequences I may face if I went to the hospital. I did not have a sitter, this was my choice, and I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt because my boyfriend would have been freaking out and probably freaked me out even worse. I just powered through it, just laid in a lake of my own shit and blood trying to go to sleep. Now to add, I had been dealing with constipation issues sincel getting pregnant and I think that played a large role in amount of pain. I think I‚Äôd recommend taking stool softeners 72-48 hours before a pill abortion if you‚Äôre having constipation issues. Luckily after this it was pretty smooth sailing. I woke up cold, shaking, and extremely pail from the blood loss. I was terrified to take the other pills (mine was take 4, then 2 more 3 hours later, then 2 again 3 hours after that) due to what had happened, but thank goodness it went fine. I even got up and made myself some popcorn. The next morning I woke up early before my alarm could even go off feeling as new and refreshed as ever. I went out and even got myself a coffee and breakfast before work which I nevvvver do. I expected to be depressed about it, or even just sore, but all I could think about was that for the first time in over a month I didn‚Äôt feel terminally ill. I could actually get up and move! I was immediately back to my old self before the pregnancy. My Boyfriend is pretty traumatized by the whole situation though. He works about 50 hours a week and despite this we‚Äôre still constantly struggling, he tells me he doesn‚Äôt even know what he‚Äôs working for if he can‚Äôt even provide the bare minimum for his family. I mean I‚Äôm happy to not feel sick anymore, but this whole situation has really just made both of us feel so hopeless. While we fully support everyone‚Äôs right to choose both of us just kinda feel like we had no choice, and that abortion was the only humane thing we could do if we actually loved the child.",4,1759446972.0,abortion,4,1.0,False

i work at a luxury hotel, and used to work in the coffee shop. it got us more than a million dollars in revenue last year if i remember correctly. 

despite our luxury status, the managers do not seem interested in getting involved in our affairs as long as we keep making them money. despite constant begging for change or even for managers to hear me out, i was eventually forced out of my position entirely; and im still suffering the consequences of everything despite me leaving the coffee shop in june(posting in october). 

i was forced to carry the brunt of the duties for the duration of my second year, as i was appointed to a training position for our new hires. i take things pretty seriously, and even began to organize our recipes and instruction manuals and tweaked things to stop wasting product the way we were before. even though i did all of this, none of my coworkers would follow my instructions or guides; and the managers would not intervene to help at all. our shop is tucked away in the hotel and not many managers naturally walk by us; leading to everyone in the shop doing whatever they please. there was absolutely no leadership besides what i was attempting to give, but it was all shut down pretty rudely by my coworkers. despite me reporting to my managers and even hr that i was begging for help and that it wasnt fair to me to deal with all this. its hard enough dealing with high class clients and guests when my coworkers are doing their jobs properly ü´†(rare). i began complaining during winter of 2023, and in july 2024, i had to go above my manager to our f&b director.... who did not help either. 

october 2025, we had a new hire. she is older than me and much more vocal than me. shes able to speak her mind much better than i am, since im not able to at all. she does not like me and my autistic attitude (im guessing) and made the environment hostile whenever i tried to gently correct her on things (....i was the training coach... and had been there 2 years at that point.üò≠.).....her presence began to really trigger me, causing me to have almost daily panic attacks. she gets offended when i focus on my job instead of her and gets hostile with me when i tried to tell managers about it. she makes snarky comments to me in front of coworkers and guests, making me cry and forcing me to leave the store multiple times due to crying uncontrollably. but because i have an eerie, quiet dissociative cry instead of a loud, angry, screaming wail like hers; my struggles werent taken seriously i guess 

i began to clearly decline after that. everyone around me could tell, and everyone kept asking what the problem was. i was crying in the halls, dissociating and unable to talk. my days off and weeks off were spent the same way. i told everyone. no one listened. i broke in january 2025, eventually being pulled aside by the f&b director, who claimed to be worried for my safety; as she thought i was a suicide risk.      .... well...i was? it was really obvious. and it still is. despite this, she did nothing to help. 

again, i told multiple managers. nothing happened. this continued; forcing me to take multiple long weeks off due to the fear of being around her. im still scared of seeing her in the halls now. eventually, she blew up at me in the store, yelling at me and saying how awful i was and that she never wanted to work with me again. she caused a scene, forcing lp to come and barricade the managers office due to her threatening violence on me (allegedly üò≠). ..... that was june. i went to hr the next day and they were able to transfer me to a different department.... but that was all.

i even tries drastic measures, things that got me in trouble; just to pull attention from the managers. id cut a girls tips for the day for not helping with anything at all; and instead of talking to her about her performance, i was the only one talked to. 

i was written up multiple times by the same f&b director who claimed to want to help me, even writing lies on her statement to hr about me. when i went to hr about it, they didnt even believe me. she wrote me up for harassment. for harassing her. i was basically nonverbal and struggling to keep my appearances up in public, even with a mask on. i was later written up for wearing the mask, despite telling the f&b director directly that it was the only thing that helped me deal with my humiliation in front of everyone.

......im rambling, im sorry. i dont know how to get all of this out correctly. i want to try to go back to hr now that im not actively in the shop and suffering publicly in front of everyone ....... is it worth it? ü•≤.... i dont have any friends or family to talk to, and i come from a pretty rough upbringing which makes me doubt myself pretty severely lol. it feels like i was taken advantage of, and its humiliating to think about. it diesnt help that im making less money now that im not getting tips ü´†and i dont think i can go back to the shop ever due to everything.... i dont even know if i can work a normal service job ever again. its so hard for me to talk now, i just feel like everyones ignoring me. i feel crazy, i just cant deal with it anymore..



[TLDR] despite being very vocal about my workplace environment related issues, management and hr did nothing to help me; leading me to have a severe decline in my mental health (at my worst, i was completely catatonic and struggled to talk or move; but was forced to anyways) and was even written up for having an episode .",0,1759446805.0,AskHR,6,0.5,False

My mom‚Äôs side of the family has a history of thyroid problems in the women, 2 out of 5 have hypo, 1 has hyper and the others are unknown. They have all had to have surgery and cut out either half or all of their thyroid gland.

My symptoms that have been consistent for 9+ years (since 13) are: -Cold hands and feet -Lower belly fat that will not go away -Fluid in fingers, ankles, toes -‚ÄúPuffy‚Äù everywhere, face, body, everywhere -Very low energy -difficulty making decisions

What has progressed since I was 13 has been: -Difficulty concentrating, focusing, memory loss that is getting worse etc. -Depression that is getting worse. By depression, I mean major depression confirmed by a therapist. The kind of depression that has made me feel numb to everything including things I used to enjoy.

As of 1 year ago now, since I changed my diet from the typical American diet (Ultra processed foods, coffee, sugar, simple carbs like bread etc.) to a whole foods diet (grass-fed meats, butter, organic fruits/veggies etc.), I have had irregular periods. I have gone over 5 months without a period. Before I switched my diet away from ultra processed foods, I was having regular cycles. My physique has stayed relatively the same since I was 13, just a little overall more fat distributed the same way all over my body.

This year, I have been to the doctor a lot because I am sick of living this way, having little energy, not enjoying life and just being depressed. So I changed my diet, in hopes that that would give me energy and make me lose the belly fat. My energy levels have not changed at all since I was 13. My change of diet hasn‚Äôt changed anything, I have the same lower belly fat and no increase in energy.

For lifestyle, I have always gotten 7-8+ hours of sleep each night no problem, since the diet change I only drink water and kefir- no more coffee, I have never drank or smoked or done any drugs or birth control, I do not take any meds, I do not have major stressors in my life, my life is safe. I try to strength train 3x a week.

Here are the lab results that I have gotten:

9/6/25 Lab results notes (I copy and pasted them): Your recent lab results indicate that your Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) Antibodies level is elevated at 177 IU/mL, exceeding the normal range of 0 to 34 IU/mL. Additionally, your insulin level is high at 40.7, above the normal range of 2.6 to 24.9, and your C-Peptide level is also elevated at 4.8, surpassing the normal range of 1.1 to 4.4. Albumin is slightly high at 5.1 g/dL. Your glucose level is low at 55 mg/dL, and your creatinine level is slightly high at 1.08 mg/dL. Furthermore, your vitamin D level is low at 26.4 ng/mL. In contrast, your thyroid function tests show that your TSH level is 1.27 and Free T4 level is 1.28, both within normal ranges. Your Free Triiodothyronine (T3) level is also normal at 2.9 pg/mL. Lastly, your complete blood count results, including white blood cells, red blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, are all within normal ranges, indicating overall good blood health. Your morning cortisol level is within the normal range at 9.2 (ug/dL).

Thyroid ultrasound findings on 9/9/25:

1.	‚Å†Nonenlarged thyroid gland with nonspecific mildly heterogeneous background echotexture.
2.	‚Å†A couple of low suspicion subcentimeter nodules are noted on the right, not meeting criteria for FNA consideration recommendation at this time. Ultrasound follow-up in one year is recommended. One of the nodules is potentially extrathyroidal along the deep mid pole of the right lobe. Please correlate with serum calcium and PTH as parathyroid hypertrophy is a consideration.

And lastly, my doctor did a parathyroid test that tested for my parathyroid and that test came back in range. Calcium was at 10.2 and the reference range is 8.7-10.2. PTH intact was at 21 and the range is 15-65.

I had another episode today. In fact, I had 2, both in class. My episodes in class have all been the same. I'll be sitting there, and first I start to get dizzy. Then what feels like all at once, I feel my blood pressure dropping rapidly, the dizziness intensifies, my vision gets blurry, I get really nauseous, most of the time my ears start ringing, I get really short of breath almost as if i'm hyperventilating, my whole body starts to shake, first my hands get clammy then my fingernails turn purple and my hands get cold, and in a matter of seconds, to try to compensate, my heart rate skyrockets by about 30 points, making my resting heart go from around 70 to 100 almost instantaneously. I also get the sensation that I have to pee even if I don't. My legs also get tingly, so a lot of the time I cross the bottom of my legs and start tensing my calves. That's helped in keeping me from going fully unconscious. Once it subsides, I get a headache. It makes me curious if this is more of an Orthostatic Hypotension issue or just my POTS and NCS working together to make me miserable again. At least it's consistent, but it doesn't make it suck any less.

Anyways, I had a small win today. I had my first episode in my first class, but I made it to my next class, then rerouted, and instead of going to my favorite coffee shop/boba tea place to do homework, I came home to lie in bed and do homework. Then, I made it to my last class of the day from 3:35-4:50. There I had my second episode of the day. The win? I actually made it to all 3 of my classes despite this stupid disease AND I usually let embarrassment get to me (if I do fully pass out in class, they‚Äôre required to call 911) and I‚Äôll try to go out in the hall even though I‚Äôm actively passing out. Today, I stayed put! I knew it wasn‚Äôt safe to leave so instead I put my head down on my desk and waited til class was over.

My physique has stayed relatively the same since I was 13, just a little overall more fat distributed the same way all over my body.

This year, I have been to the doctor a lot because I am sick of living this way, having little energy, not enjoying life and just being depressed. So I changed my diet, in hopes that that would give me energy and make me lose the belly fat. My energy levels have not changed at all since I was 13. My change of diet hasn‚Äôt changed anything, I have the same lower belly fat and no increase in energy.

For lifestyle, I have always gotten 7-8+ hours of sleep each night no problem, since the diet change I only drink water and kefir- no more coffee, I have never drank or smoked or done any drugs or birth control, I do not take any meds, I do not have major stressors in my life, my life is safe. I try to strength train 3x a week.

Here are the lab results that I have gotten:

9/6/25 Lab results notes (I copy and pasted them): Your recent lab results indicate that your Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) Antibodies level is elevated at 177 IU/mL, exceeding the normal range of 0 to 34 IU/mL. Additionally, your insulin level is high at 40.7, above the normal range of 2.6 to 24.9, and your C-Peptide level is also elevated at 4.8, surpassing the normal range of 1.1 to 4.4. Albumin is slightly high at 5.1 g/dL. Your glucose level is low at 55 mg/dL, and your creatinine level is slightly high at 1.08 mg/dL. Furthermore, your vitamin D level is low at 26.4 ng/mL. In contrast, your thyroid function tests show that your TSH level is 1.27 and Free T4 level is 1.28, both within normal ranges. Your Free Triiodothyronine (T3) level is also normal at 2.9 pg/mL. Lastly, your complete blood count results, including white blood cells, red blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, are all within normal ranges, indicating overall good blood health. Your morning cortisol level is within the normal range at 9.2 (ug/dL).

Thyroid ultrasound findings on 9/9/25:

1.	‚Å†Nonenlarged thyroid gland with nonspecific mildly heterogeneous background echotexture.
2.	‚Å†A couple of low suspicion subcentimeter nodules are noted on the right, not meeting criteria for FNA consideration recommendation at this time. Ultrasound follow-up in one year is recommended. One of the nodules is potentially extrathyroidal along the deep mid pole of the right lobe. Please correlate with serum calcium and PTH as parathyroid hypertrophy is a consideration.

And lastly, my doctor did a parathyroid test that tested for my parathyroid and that test came back in range. Calcium was at 10.2 and the reference range is 8.7-10.2. PTH intact was at 21 and the range is 15-65.

I am really new to thyroid problems, I don‚Äôt know much about it, but I hate the idea of taking modern pills instead of naturally healing myself. Please let me know what to expect, what you think it is or any other info to naturally healing myself. Thank you!",1,1759446430.0,Hashimotos,0,1.0,False

A lot of people use it to find someone for sexting or simply to share their fantasies. One day, I saw a post from a girl that said:

‚ÄúI need a simp that covers my iced coffee habits and gets me lunch so I can saveü§£ cus a girl can‚Äôt give either of those upü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§£‚Äù

I replied that I‚Äôd be more than willing to do that for her, and that‚Äôs how we started talking. She sent me some pictures of herself and a few voice messages. I really liked that she gave me a lot of her time and that we had relaxed conversations about our day. She shared things about her life, and I did the same.

For the first few days, she didn‚Äôt ask me for any money at all. In fact, she never asked directly‚Äîuntil I told her how much I would love to be her simp. That‚Äôs when she asked if I could buy her snacks and coffee for work.

Now, here‚Äôs the thing: I‚Äôm currently waiting to start working, and right now I only have about $200 to get through each month. But I‚Äôve had this fantasy for years, and honestly, the moment she asked me, I felt this rush of adrenaline and excitement like I had never felt before in my life. She asked me to send her $23, and since it wasn‚Äôt a huge amount, I decided to do it‚Äîjust once. And I didn‚Äôt regret it.

Even though I knew I couldn‚Äôt afford to do this every day (because if I sent her $20 a day, in five days half my money would be gone, and in ten days I‚Äôd have nothing left), at that moment I didn‚Äôt care. When I bought her those snacks, she reacted with so much happiness and excitement, and she became more confident. Even though I had told myself I‚Äôd only do it once just to experience what it feels like, when I saw that reaction, I felt like I wanted to keep doing it again and again.

A little later, I happened to see another post she made on the app. It said:

‚ÄúMy new simp just covered my work snacks and coffee for today, he‚Äôs the sweetestü•∞üíÅüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äù

When I saw that, I felt so proud that she was talking about me. I was happy that she was finally starting to become more demanding.

But the very next day, something serious happened: a huge debt that my grandfather left before he passed away came up, and now I have to find $8,000 by the end of the month to save our house. So I had to tell her that I can‚Äôt give her what she deserves right now. I feel so weak and like such a failure. I‚Äôm so jealous of the other guys that will simp for her. I wish I were rich and could give her the whole world.

She told me that once I sort things out, I can come back to her. I really hope I can. She‚Äôs so addictive and amazing!",7,1759446348.0,paypigs2,7,1.0,False

I'm tired of almost every single story he tells is about him getting drunk and even if I don't want to hear stories about him getting drunk or when we were together I didn't want to go bars he was still drag me there anyway and he will tell me to relax and he would tell me that it's fine but it's not fun for me at all it is disgusting. ,5,1759446120.0,AlAnon,11,0.86,False

**TL;DR:** Owning up isn't just taking responsibility for past actions. It's the mechanism that literally recreates your past because past/present/future exist in present tense, not past tense. The moment you own up for what you created (including your body, your circumstances, your delusions), you become Ishvara (lord) of your existence. Most spiritual seekers miss this completely.

Listen. I need to tell you something about time that changes everything.

Past tense is dead but past is not dead. Future tense is yet to manifest but future is not yet to be manifested.

Past is not ""was"". It ""IS"". Future itself is not ""will be"". Future ""IS"". Past, present and future ""IS""‚ÄîThathata, Nithyatva (eternal existence), ""IS""ness.

One beautiful thing in your life is this: If you own up now, even the past is recreated because past is not dead as you think.

This is Paramashiva Jnana (ultimate knowledge)‚Äîthe ultimate revelation from the space of Paramashiva.

# What owning up actually means

The existence of Ishvaratva (divine lordship) is nothing but the decision to own up to the principles of creation, sustenance, rejuvenation, delusion and liberation in your existence.

If you own up to these for a large number of people, you become a Mahamandaleshwar (spiritual leader of a great region). If you own up for the whole universe, you become the Ishvara of the Brahmanda (lord of the cosmos). The principles of existence of Ishvara is owning up to the principles of creation, sustenance, rejuvenation, delusion, and liberation, that you created.

Owning up is the Ajomukha (the sixth unmanifest face and phase, the antimatter dimension of Paramashiva)‚Äîthe identity and dimension of Paramashiva. When I say Ishana, I mean the liberating face and phase of Paramashiva.

Owning up is revealed only to Yogis.

# The four types of people

Who owns up is Yogi. Who doesn't is Bhogi (one lost in pleasures). Who puts blames on others is Rogi (diseased one). And who does not even care about it is Shogi (one in mourning).

Which one are you right now?

Whoever owns up becomes Kailasa. Whoever blames others becomes demons.

If you own up, immediate transformation starts in your life. If you are tired, bored, feeling overwhelmed and overloaded, own up to that. Owning up is the secret of Ishvaratva.

# You created your body (yes, really)

Just see your life‚ÄîPindanda (microcosm of your individual existence). Understand what you created.

If you are in Paramashanta Swarupa (your ultimate restful being), you will own up for what you created. The mechanism which converts bread into blood inside your body is something you created. You learnt the science from the cosmos and you created it. Human body is the greatest creation in the universe and you created it.

Anyone who owns up that you created your body will manifest the powers related to the body‚Äîmanipulation, upgrading, healing powers related to the body.

**Example:** If you have a fatty liver, sit with your liver and say, ""I created it. What for I created it?"" Owning up starts healing.

Fatty liver is such a simple problem. You just need to tell your stomach, ""Can you burn a little more? I will give you mantra as a fuel material."" In Veda-Agamic tradition, any mantra can be used to awaken the Jataragni (fire in the stomach). If you feel strongly connected to Ganesha, chant any of the beautiful Upanishad mantras on Ganesha and tell him, ""I want you to be awakened in my stomach and please clean up my fatty liver.""

This isn't visualization. This is consciousness directly interfacing with biological systems you created.

# The real brainwashing happening to you

You being brainwashed, and you eating all the junk and filthy food-like products is the real brainwashing happening to you. Nirahara Samyama (fasting practice) is not brainwashing you, it is stomach-washing you. It is detoxing you.

I am only asking: Go for healthy juicing for a few days. When the patterns are forcing you to eat, be in Paramashanta Swarupa, managing Nirahara. It is a conscious power.

When the tamas (inertness), dullness is pushing you to the bed and depression is literally sucking you to the bed, you waking up and doing yoga is a power.

How much ever abuses, attacks, injustice you may feel in your life, sitting and connecting with Paramashiva and doing puja is a conscious resource.

You would have manifested many such conscious resources. Own up for it.

# The complete framework

Own up for what you are manifesting, creating, sustaining, destroying and own up to how you were deluded and where you are still deluded and how you need to get out of delusion and where all you have liberated yourself and where you need to further liberate yourself.

When you start owning up from Paramashanta Swarupa, you will see the 25 heads of Paramashiva operating in you also and you will know what to create, what to sustain, what to destroy, what to put in delusion and how to get you out of delusion and from what you are liberated and from which you need to liberate yourself more. Nothing else.

When you own up, you are Paramashiva‚ÄîIshvara. When you own up for your life, you become Ishvara for you. This is the way you become Atmeshvara (Ishvara for yourself)‚ÄîIshvara for yourself first in Kailasa.

# Your resources (including death)

I want all my disciples to take it very seriously and sit with Paramashanta Swarupa and look around. Don't be afraid. You have amazing resources.

Death is a conscious resource you have. Once you have manifested the human body, the whole science of manifesting the human body is in your bio memory, your consciousness. Unless you decide human life is too much torture and you don't want it, no one can stop you creating the human body. That is the extent of Paramashiva's existence, compassion and grace.

# Even your guilt about owning up? Own that too

Even if you have so much of shivering and guilt of owning up, own up for that also.

Much of the guilt, fear and shivering is not really there in your head. Just have a cup of coffee and it will melt down, or have Kadukkai Podi or castor oil for one day and you will see 90% of your fears disappear. The quality of your life will change.

Detox your system and own up for your existence. So much of suffering will reduce. So much of joy will be manifested.

# The five Iyamas: power generators, not moral rules

The principles of creation‚Äîlove, Parashakti (divine feminine energy), all the motherly qualities and all the five Iyama (principles of righteous living)‚Äîlike Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truth), Asteya (non-stealing), Aparigraha (non-possession) and Brahmacharya (life force retention) should be lived.

Yesterday, one of my daughters was telling, ""Yama is my new friend who is helping me!"" What a sweet cognition. When you understand that Yama is your friend and guru, you will understand Kathopanishad. Relate with Yama like how Nachiketa related with Yama. Iyama and Yama Dharma are one and the same‚Äîthe one who maintains the karma of Iyama.

Non-violence is such a power to manifest what you want in life.

Aparigraha‚Äîliving with minimal things‚Äîis such a power to manifest what you want.

Asteya‚Äînon-stealing‚Äîis such a power to manifest what you want.

The more and more you add these five, the more and more you create, manifest joy, bliss, enlightenment.

# Strategic non-violence

When you add more and more non-violence, you will become strategic in handling your enemies who are attacking you. And you will not waste your time in unnecessary fighting. You will know where to stop them.

This is the Brahmanical quality‚ÄîBrahmanatva (priestly wisdom), Chanakyatva (strategic wisdom). It is about not picking up weapon but knowing how to just keep them away. Know what for you have freedom, maintain that and keep the enemies away. You will be able to do that if you sit in Paramashanta Swarupa and add more and more Ahimsa in your thinking.

A non-violent strategic thinking knows what to manifest.

# Real example: Six hours in the world's largest mall

I understood what is my purpose of my existence and what is my freedom. I don't need freedom to go to a mall because I am never going to go there.

Even when I was revered and respected and taken around the world's largest malls, I came out empty handed. One of the world's largest mall owners was my devotee. He was inaugurating one wing of the mall. He took me for it as the chief guest. That is the longest time I have ever spent in any mall. I walked around for six hours.

He said, ""Swamiji, anything you want is yours, please choose!"" I told him, ""Honestly, nothing seems to be not only useful, but even relevant to my life!"" He told me, ""It is the pride of our mall, please choose."" I told him, ""I don't mean to disrespect you."" Of course if he had Rudraksha, I would have picked it up because I can wear it for Satsang.

Being very clear about your existence and not picking anything that is not relevant to your existence is Aparigraha. Just disown what you don't need to run your life or your existence.

When you think, ""Oh, someday this may be needed for me,"" that is where the delusion creeps in.

I may need freedom maximum to walk in the beach in Paramashanta Swarupa, being in Samadhi, from Shukla Paksha Dvadasi to Krishnapaksha Panchami of the moon. Or I may need freedom to give Satsang.

I create, sustain the life I wanted. I destroy what is not needed and rejuvenate what I want. Wherever delusion gets entertained, I liberate myself from it more and more the way I want.

So I own up and become Ishvara for my life. And I teach everyone to become Ishvara for your own life.

# The progression

Next, if you own up to a group of people's life, you become Kulapati (head of spiritual community). If you own up to a Mandala (region of people), you become Mandaleshvara (lord of that region). If you own up to a Mahamandala (great region), you become Mahamandaleshvara (great spiritual leader).

All my Sanyasis and Gurukul Balasants: Take it as a spiritual lesson. You will become Atmeshvara today. Sit and see: These are the places where I manifested, sustained, rejuvenated, I put myself into delusion and I liberated myself as Swamiji wanted, and these are the places where I did not manifest, sustain, rejuvenate, put myself into delusion and liberate myself as Swamiji wanted.

Help yourself to become Atmeshvara and go on helping more and more people around you to become Ishvara for their life. It is the way you own up, that your life is decided.

# Start small, start now

Don't plan to become Ishvara for the whole universe. Immediately become Ishvara for your own life. You will become successful in just a few days.

You don't need to become 100% Ishvara for your life. You just need to understand the knack, it is enough. Then you can start becoming Kulapati.

Vegah Nimittavisheshaat Karmano Jaayate (action and reaction are equal and opposite)‚ÄîGods and demons will exist forever. But if you sit in Paramashanta Swarupa and own up, you will go beyond these two‚Äîas Paramashiva.

Owning up is the master key.

# Bottom line

Each of the creative aspects of your life, like love, added to your system, leads to enlightenment, liberation, more and more joy and bliss.

Life as such is beautiful, absolute Paramashiva. Whether it is the air you are breathing in or the people happening in your life, it is absolutely beautiful.

You just need to own up to what you need to manifest, sustain, destroy, pull out of delusion and liberate.

# Direct transmission

I will make this principle, truth, as a reality to all my disciples and devotees who declare your integrity to me. I will make this as your experience.

The transformation from blame to ownership, from victim consciousness to Ishvaratva, from past as fixed to past as recreatable‚Äîthis is available right here, right now. To transform this understanding into living experience, the Paramashiva Sena Summit (October 1 - November 1, 2025) offers direct transmission of these awakening processes through living Siddha tradition. This is where owning up becomes your lived reality, where Atmeshvara awakens as your natural state.

By the grace of Paramashiva, I will connect all of us to Paramashiva and I will make all my devotees and disciples who declare their integrity to me to experience Ishvaratva, Paramashivatva (the state of being Paramashiva).

**What in your life are you ready to own up for? Have you experienced the difference between owning up and just accepting responsibility?**

Om Nithyananda Paramashivoham!

**May you awaken to the truth that owning up is the master key. May you become Atmeshvara‚ÄîIshvara for your own life. May your past, present, and future exist in the eternal ""IS"" of Paramashiva.**",1,1759446056.0,AskNithyanandaAI,0,1.0,False

I had another episode today. In fact, I had 2, both in class. My episodes in class have all been the same. I'll be sitting there, and first I start to get dizzy. Then what feels like all at once, I feel my blood pressure dropping rapidly, the dizziness intensifies, my vision gets blurry, I get really nauseous, most of the time my ears start ringing, I get really short of breath almost as if i'm hyperventilating, my whole body starts to shake, first my hands get clammy then my fingernails turn purple and my hands get cold, and in a matter of seconds, to try to compensate, my heart rate skyrockets by about 30 points, making my resting heart go from around 70 to 100 almost instantaneously. I also get the sensation that I have to pee even if I don't. My legs also get tingly, so a lot of the time I cross the bottom of my legs and start tensing my calves. That's helped in keeping me from going fully unconscious. Once it subsides, I get a headache. It makes me curious if this is more of an Orthostatic Hypotension issue or just my POTS and NCS working together to make me miserable again. At least it's consistent, but it doesn't make it suck any less. 

Anyways, I had a small win today. I had my first episode in my first class, but I made it to my next class, then rerouted, and instead of going to my favorite coffee shop/boba tea place to do homework, I came home to lie in bed and do homework. Then, I made it to my last class of the day from 3:35-4:50. There I had my second episode of the day. The win? I actually made it to all 3 of my classes despite this stupid disease AND I usually let embarrassment get to me (if I do fully pass out in class, they‚Äôre required to call 911) and I‚Äôll try to go out in the hall even though I‚Äôm actively passing out. Today, I stayed put! I knew it wasn‚Äôt safe to leave so instead I put my head down on my desk and waited til class was over. The other small win is I finally made an appointment with my PCP to create a medical action plan for my condition so that me and the people around me have a better idea of what‚Äôs an emergency vs bad but not emergency vs okay.

I clean, backflush and descale my machine (GCP) when my coffee starts to taste kind of bitter or rancid, and this usually helps, but this time it seems it might be something else as my coffee still tastes really bad.

I suspect it is the grinder (Baratza Encore ESP) which I have not cleaned for 3-4 months. I tried deep cleaning it by disassembling it, clearning some parts, removing accumulated residue, etc... However, I think the clean is not deep enough as I am not supposed to use water or soap for most critical parts, and I am limited to a dry cloth and brush, etc. Plus it is not super easy to access all the parts with a cloth or brush.

After ""cleaning"" it it still smells really bad in there.

Has anyone had similar experience with this or other grinders?

I drink mostly dark to medium roast. The beans are a bit oily but not too bad (Lavazza Espresso beans).

I am wondering if getting a better or easier to clean grinder would make a difference.

After Bon Appetite I went for another food drama, so I'm currently midway through Pasta. 

  
I feel like these 3 specific shows feel like it's the same character in many ways which I think is more of an issue with the scripting, directing or/and rather telling of the reality.

  
There is one scene where her father in Pasta >!talking with a friend about how he thinks she found a bad tempered man in the resturant and the friend goes on to say she experienced her father and he acknowledged his worry about her being at ease in accepting that type of behaviour.!<

This is also the first show I've watched again of the ML of pasta since he passed away. Unfortunately it took me too long to think that his character was problematic. I blame his charisma (coffee prince memories)

  
It got me thinking if many of her other roles are similar as well? Even in The camellia blooms, >!her character is so lax in her boundaries, the only difference is that her love interest isn't this shouting, or immature person like in these 3 other mentioned shows, however she still gets it from those in the neighbourhood. !<

  
I don't know if it's meant to be showing the reality of the 'average' Korean female and how she usually gets treated by her family and people she likes and her need to survive and having to endure it with a smile. Or if it's meant to show the desire for women to act in this manner, maybe both?

  
Would love to hear you thoughts, especially if you have watched her other works and felt she had the same archetype. 

  
The more I watch. The more obvious the distinctions of what is acceptable for who becomes apparent.

I personally think she is beautiful but if her roles are indeed based on her deemed social ranking it feels rather bleak. This isn't anything new. I've read a few comments and posts about this same thread in relation to other actors and the type of roles such as Ji Chang-wook in his action roles. 

  
I know many Korean actresses and actors do try different genres and roles to some degree.

  
Feels very restrictive and at this rate feels like that exact thing could and may be adding to the current decline in quality we are seeing and will see more of.

First, I want to thank you all for your helpful and enlightening comments. I was ready to embrace the hate because I was feeling guilty about what I said when I asked Ashley to be my MOH. I thought I fired the first shot of an all-out family war, but now I realize that Ashley would‚Äôve started it either way. I‚Äôve never been a Reddit poster before and was gonna be a one and done, but since many of you asked, here‚Äôs an update/deeper dive into this ‚Äúcircus,‚Äù as Ashley had put it.

Second Hannah is in the wedding party and Ashley is out.

Ashley and I‚Äôs argument truly was the first battle of our family war, and my parents didn‚Äôt know how to handle it. They have only ever handled our family problems with quick band-aid fixes, because actually working through issues was too hard. *And Ashley knows how to play our family like a fiddle.*

I didn‚Äôt share details of this part of the story, but I meant it when I said Ashley had dug hard into my choices for bridesmaids. She was trying to cultivate her perfect bridal party for a bachelorette party. She even had me convinced that our mom didn‚Äôt think our under 21 cousin should be a BM either.¬† When I called my mom to talk about Ashley and everything else, all she did was berate me. She said I should‚Äôve known that inviting Hannah to be a BM would be inviting drama, and both Ashley and I were being selfish. But I called her out for not caring enough to actually hear Ashley or I out. I accused her of only wanting the drama to go away instead of actually working through our issues. It was a pretty ugly argument, too.

But when my mom and I talked again later, she told me that she didn‚Äôt care whether or not Hannah was a BM. She was upset that I told her I changed my mind about asking my cousin to be a BM, which is why she reacted so harshly and told me I should kick Hannah out. *And then it clicked for both of us*. Ashley purposely put the idea of my mom not liking our cousin as a BM in my head, hoping mom and I would fight, which might lead to me kicking Hannah out of the bridal party. We felt stupid for playing right into her hand.¬†

I told my mom I was going to decide what to do about Ashley‚Äôs ultimatum on my own. She cried and said that she was sorry for her part in everything. I told her I didn‚Äôt really care that I wouldn't be Ashley‚Äôs MOH one day. I was hurt because I thought we had a bond we clearly didn‚Äôt have. I realized my sister doesn‚Äôt love me the way I love her. My mom said of course she did. This whole thing has been about Ashley not wanting to admit that I‚Äôm the only person that has ever really been there for her, while making me feel like she‚Äôs the only friend I really have.

Onto the actual update. I took some time to go over your comments and think about everything. My fiance pushed me to put myself first over my family for once, whatever that meant for me. I seriously considered removing both Ashley and Hannah for a while. I thought it would be a way to take my power back without giving into her ultimatum and still trying to keep the peace. But I couldn‚Äôt do that to Hannah or myself. I decided it‚Äôs time to stand up to Ashley to show her I will not walk on eggshells for her anymore.

I went over to Ashley‚Äôs again to talk to her. We tried to spend the first couple of minutes catching up, but it was awkward, like estranged friends meeting for coffee. It didn‚Äôt take her long to ask me what I decided for the bridal party. I told her that I thought a lot about the best decision for everyone, and asked if she would let me get through my spiel uninterrupted before we talk about it. She agreed. I said that I was going to be honest but open with her, and hoped she would be with me, too.

I told Ashley that her recent actions hurt me deeply. I reiterated that I didn‚Äôt really care if I was her MOH or not one day. The core of my wound was realizing she didn‚Äôt think we were as close as I thought we were. That created drama with wedding related-events and use them to hurt me. She tried saying that she never said that about us not being close. But I quoted her in our initial argument saying we weren‚Äôt close in the way our mom is with our aunts. She said ‚ÄúNo. I never said that.‚Äù in her classic higher-pitch tone of condescension. I said I didn‚Äôt want to argue about details that didn‚Äôt matter and wasn‚Äôt done with my spiel yet. But that just turned into more brief arguing. I repeated how I didn‚Äôt want to argue and had a whole speech prepared, but screw it. I told her I wasn‚Äôt going to give into any ultimatum. I‚Äôm keeping Hannah and I wanted Ashley to be a BM too, but would understand if she didn‚Äôt want that anymore.

I swear I could see the five stages of grief on her face in the span of five seconds. I almost felt bad for her. It was a fleeting moment that passed as soon as she put the bitch face back on and said ‚ÄúYou know Mom and Dad won‚Äôt let you, right?‚Äù in her infamous tone of condescension. 

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt get to decide who‚Äôs in my wedding party.‚Äù I asserted.

*‚ÄúThen I hope you‚Äôre ready to say goodbye to your wedding altogether.‚Äù*

I thought she was going to explode first. But it was me.

‚ÄúYou know what? I let that go when you brought up Dad‚Äôs money the first time. But I‚Äôm glad you did it again, let‚Äôs get into that!‚Äù I snapped.

First I reminded her that the only wedding things our parents are paying for are the catering and bar service. My fiance and I had planned on paying for the entire wedding ourselves. But my parents wanted to invite more guests and have a bigger bar than my fiance and I were planning on. So they offered to pay for catering and the bar service to get us to expand the guest list and go with the bigger bar, so we accepted. I told her I didn't know where she found the nerve to call me spoiled and entitled for ""letting"" mom and dad pay for two vendors. I always paid them on time for my phone bill and car insurance, but she has yet to pay them one time. I never took a cent to get an apartment or a car, but she has.

Ashley got heated, too, accusing me of orchestrating this whole thing to get back at her and make her look bad to our parents and our family. I said she was the only one who thought like that. I asked what else I could do for her besides kick Hannah out. I just wanted all the drama to end and for the animosity between us to be over. Ashley said I was making that hard while I was making her look like the bad guy. She told me this never would‚Äôve happened if I hadn‚Äôt asked Hannah to be a BM in the first place. ‚ÄúSo you expect me to make you my MOH one day, but you don‚Äôt want me as a BM. You know you sound like an insane and entitled bridezilla, right?‚Äù

I repeated how I didn‚Äôt really care about that, but she insisted that‚Äôs what this came down to, and I‚Äôm punishing her. I told her I still wanted her as a BM, but she said she couldn't if Hannah was too. We pretty much went in circles until she said if she couldn‚Äôt come to the wedding as part of the wedding party, then she wouldn‚Äôt be attending at all. I told her that was her decision and I knew she was hurting and I was sorry for my part in that. I said I hoped she would change her mind and I‚Äôm always open to talk, and her BM position is always open, before I left.

I wanted to stay true to my word about not airing our dirty laundry out to anyone else, so I let Ashley tell our parents about my decision. She told them I kicked her out, but I told them what really happened. My parents said it sounded like she was thinking I‚Äôll change my mind about Hannah in the future. My mom cast herself off as Switzerland, wanting Ashley and I to work it out between ourselves. My dad pressured me to reconsider ‚ÄúHannah‚Äôs role‚Äù, saying we were both reacting emotionally and harshly. He‚Äôs afraid I‚Äôll regret not having my sister in my wedding. I asked what he had to say to Ashley about her part in this. I reminded him that it was Ashley‚Äôs decision to remove herself as a BM. He said he told her that she should‚Äôve talked through her feelings about Hannah with me instead of enforcing an ultimatum. But he said two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right, and we should just admit that and make up.

Since then, I've learned that Ashley has been telling friends and family that I kicked her out of my wedding. It does kinda bother me that Ashley is changing and leaving out details to change the narrative.  I‚Äôm honest when asked what happened. But I don‚Äôt go out of my way to gossip about my sister. The people that know our family well enough, know to ask my parents or myself for the real story.

Sorry the update took so long, and that it is so long. It took my sister and I almost a month to talk after she gave me the ultimatum. It's been over a month now since that last argument. I‚Äôve been trying to reach out to see if we can talk things out, but so far she hasn‚Äôt responded. I‚Äôm honestly not sure where we‚Äôll go from here. But for now, thanks all for the feedback and advice, and helping me get to this place. I do feel like I've lifted a burden by standing up to my sister.",37,1759445678.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,17,0.97,False
