Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

By the way i am dropping first chapter of it .","The jungle was watching.

Kenji knew it. He could feel it the weight of a thousand silent stares from the trees themselves. His breath came in ragged gasps as he sprinted, feet slipping on damp earth. He shouldn’t have come here. Not at night. Not after the stories.

Just a legend, he’d told himself. Just a ghost story.

But now the air grew colder. The shadows between the trees seemed to shift. He glanced over his shoulder, his heart hammering against his ribs.

Nothing.

He spun back around and froze.

 From his left, a soft, mechanical sound cut through the silence.

CLICK..

A figure stood there, pale and still. A girl. Where her face should have been, there was only smooth, blank skin. In her hands, an old camera.

Time seemed to slow. Kenji’s eyes widened in understanding, in pure terror. He opened his mouth to scream

A massive, splintered branch from the ancient tree beside him shot forward like a spear, piercing clean through his chest.

He looked down, stunned, at the wood protruding from his torso a bloody, brutal donut.

The Faceless Girl tilted her head. A voice, soft and hollow, echoed not from a mouth, but from the air itself.

“Not… twelve days.”

The blank skin where her mouth should be seemed to curve upwards. A smile without a face.

Then, nothing.





The room was thick with the smell of stale coffee and defeat.

Around a scuffed conference table, the Special Paranormal Unit of the Osaka Prefectural Police sat in heavy silence. Case files for ""The Faceless Girl"" were stacked high, a monument to nine years of failure.

Head Officer Kaito ""Kei"" Tanaka finally slammed his fist on the table. The sound echoed like a gunshot.

""Again! It happened again! A college student, Kenji Sato found impaled in the jungle. Just like the others. She took his photo, and he was dead in minutes."" His voice was raw, strained. ""What are you all doing?! We need a backstory, a weakness, a motive Something! The Commissioner is breathing down my neck. If I lose my job over this, I'm taking every one of you down with me!""

He stormed out, leaving the room in a deeper silence.

After a long moment, Senior Detective Makio Yamazaki stood up, his chair scraping loudly. His face was a mask of exhaustion.

""I'm done,"" he announced to the silent room. ""Tell Kei I'm done. Nine years. I've wasted nine years of my life on this. My marriage is gone. My sanity is hanging by a thread. And what do we have? Nothing. She's a ghost. A rumor that kills. I can't do it anymore.""

He didn't wait for a reply. He walked out, and a piece of the unit's hope walked out with him.





The next morning, the Commissioner's office was icy with disapproval.

Commander Isao Sato, the old man who ran every police station in Osaka with an iron will, stood by the window, blowing a cloud of cigar smoke into the hazy sky. Head Officer Kei stood rigidly before the desk.

""Nine years, Tanaka,"" the old man's voice was low, dangerous. ""Nine years, and this... thing... has killed over one hundred people on our watch. The public is terrified. The press is having a field day. This is your last chance. Solve this, or you are not only fired you will be the disgrace of the entire Osaka PD. Am I clear?""

""Crystal, sir,"" Kei replied, his voice tight.

He left the office, his future hanging by a thread thinner than a camera's shutter string.

Alone, Commander Sato stared out at the city he was sworn to protect.

""Faceless Girl..."" he muttered to the smoky air. ""What are you?""




That night, a middle-aged man named Ryo, a self-proclaimed paranormal investigator, stepped into the edge of the jungle. A camera of his own hung around his neck. He was there to debunk the myth, to get the truth.

""See? Nothing,"" he whispered to himself, scanning the dark, quiet trees with his flashlight. ""Just a story for fools.""

He took another step.

From directly behind him, a soft, mechanical sound broke the silence.

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

But I ask if she wants a receipt and before I can hear her answer me I see her husband walking out if the store and I said oh wait a moment it didn't go through! Can you try again? This happens sometimes when they pull their card out too soon. And there is no wag for me to double charge them, unless I rescan the items. It just showed the payment method screen and that's how I knew it didn't go through, so she dud it again then it printed tge receipt.. 
They left but then they came back about 5 mins later with a print out from their bank showing it twice but the print out didn't say pending or approved just a total so I'm assuming it was just a pending charge since she pulled to early, bec on my screen it didn't go through. I pulled up my log and only saw one charge. Bec if only shows approved transactions. Only one with her total tge wine + coffee. They said okay well we'll just refund it and give it back. I said that's fine... Refunded it and then took tge wine and put it on the back counter... Then she says something in another language and nothing to me and storms out then they try on my coworker claiming they will talk to the manager who's not even there on weekends.. My coworker basically said the same thing and to just wait to talk to a manager on monday... 

If it gad actually charged her twice I'd of given the wine back but I o Ly had one on my till and I refunded it so. I don't think I'm in tge wrong.. I also printed tge receipts and refund receipt fir my manager but dear God lady stop yelling at me... I can only do so much I'm also new so I don't know too much how to deal with this sort of thing..

1pgawp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1pgawp8/i_cant_get_along_with_other_arabs_in_my_club/,I can’t get along with other Arabs in my club,"I (20f) am a junior in college and I’m Arab. Pretty much I grew up as the only Arab in my community and when I started college, I met so many of them.

I joined a club my freshman year that I’m still apart of that are mostly made up of Arabs/desi/muslims. I expected to make some friends but I have no luck.

I feel like I don’t fit in at all. My parents are Arab American and I’m Christian, but all of them are children of immigrants and are Muslim. I’ve been told I’m white washed by boy in the club and he made fun of my name because it’s a white name.

Now, I notice the girls in the club kinda ignored me. I was always the one to come up to them and say hi. Whenever I’m with them in a group, it’s almost impossible for me to get a word in and when I do, I feel like they aren’t listening. They are so nice though, they are happy to get me join them when I’m a group, but I never feel apart of it.

I thought, maybe I’m just shy. I am a shy person and I know people can perceive shyness as coldness. So when I realized this, I tried breaking out of my shell even more. I definitely get along better with them, but I still feel like an outcast.

One club meeting, a girl came up to me and asked me why I don’t join everyone in the library. I was confused. Turns out, the women members meet up at the library around 3 pm and hang out together. I didn’t even know about this. I have class everyday at 3 pm, so I asked if they meet later. She laughed and said no.

I don’t understand what I’m doing wrong. I get I’m not as Arab as them and I can be shy, but I feel like I try so hard to talk to them. I go out of my way, but when I’m on there group, I feel like I just so out of place. A lot of them were friends before I joined the club, so maybe that’s why.

Another time, there was a club field trip to another state and me and a bunch of the other girls decided to get a hotel room together. Five of us in one room. One morning, I woke up and saw everyone drink coffee and eating pastries. They told me they all woke up early to watch the sunset and then got coffee. I asked why they didn’t wake me up and they said because it looked like I was sleeping too good.

The only people that really include me in the club are the men. They say hi to me without me having to do it first. They seem so much more inviting. I’ve had some good conversation with them while I feel like I have shallow conversations with the women. There are some men I don’t talk to, but I get along with them more. I like to talk to the guys, but I really just want some girl friends. 

They are always nice, but I feel like I’m not Arab enough to be friends with them. 

What should I do? I feel like I’ve been trying for so long and nothing to working.

I then got in contact with Keurig and they sent a replacement over.  Worked perfectly for the first week and then it was dead in the water.  Would no longer power on.

They are now sending over a K-Café Special Edition.  Hopefully, it'll be a good experience.  A bit disappointed by the loss of the SMART Wi-Fi since I thought it was pretty cool, but I've never had so many problems with a coffee maker of all things.  ",1,1765086959.0,keurig,0,1.0,False

1pgavxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1pgavxj/im_at_my_wits_end_with_my_cat_ripping_my_curtains/,I’m at my wits end with my cat ripping my curtains,"(I am so sorry this is so long but I could really use the help!) 

I have two cats whom I love deeply. My older guy is 5 (Merlin) years old and my little one is about 8 months old (Arthur) I’d say. A year ago I moved out of an abusive situation with my older cat just after a few weeks after another of my cats passed.

I raised Merlin from when he was abandoned at about two or three days of age and he is quite literally my child. When we moved into our new apartment and it was just the two of us I could tell he was lonely as he always had a playmate. I’m disabled from several chronic illnesses so I can’t necessarily keep up with playing as much as he’d like me too.

So, about 6 months ago a friend of a friend had kittens and I agreed to adopt one from her thinking it would help Merlin feel happier having a play buddy and it absolutely has. He’s far more active and even has lost some weight which is great! Arthur is very sweet and playful and full of energy kittens are. He had a few normal behavior things like scratching the couch or trying to get to my dream catchers I have hanging on the wall but nothing crazy. The two cats love playing together and sleeping with me on the bed. Merlin isn’t jealous and Arthur respects the feline hierarchy in the house.

Here’s where I need help. this is definitely not my first rodeo I had fostered baby tiny kittens my entire life and rehomed them. I wouldn’t say I’m a complete expert on cats but I’m fairly confident in my knowledge of feline behavior and how to train and correct.  However I’m completely at my wits end on what to do now.

I have chronic severe migraines almost daily and in my bedroom I have black out curtains over my windows that I have pinned to the wall to keep as absolute much light out as possible. Arthur has always been obsessed with trying to get in the windows of my bedroom though he’s never actually seen them uncovered before.

he started bitting the push pins and pulling them out of the wall to crawl onto the window sill, so, I switched to flat thumb tacks so he couldn’t bite them and pull them out of the wall. That worked for a while but then he figured out he can still grab them with his claws and pull them out. So, I’ve taken strapping tape and taped over the thumb tacks so he can’t grab them anymore and added more thumb tacks so they’re about an inch apart from each other. He now grabs the curtain where its over the window and not taped or thumb tacked as there’s nothing to adhere that to and pulls the curtain towards himself and pops the tape loose and rips the curtain free and gets in the window. Finally, I got some natures miracle cat replant and re-tacked and tapped the curtains down and  sprayed them with the repellent which has worked for a few days. But. Then I was woken from a nap by hearing rustling of the tape and him crying because he again ripped through my curtain and got into the window and stuck in the blinds.

I’ve done everything I can fricken think of an I cannot keep this cat from ripping my curtains to get into the window. In my living room I have two windows that do not have curtains on them for the cats to perch in. I can lock the boys out at night when I sleep but I feel like that punishes Merlin who has literally slept in my bed with me since I rescued him. I’ve tried sleeping with Merlin with me and Arthur in the living room but Arthur sits at the bedroom door and yowls all night.

Arthur has also taken to peeing on my blankets or dirty clothes if they’re on the floor if I’m not giving him attention. I caught him doing it about a week ago when a friend was over and we were having coffee at the kitchen table. Then a few days ago I was in my room on the phone and when I grabbed my comforter there was fresh pee on it.

I know cats who pee out of the litter box probably have uti or other infection but as far as I can tell Arthur is not sick he’s not lethargic, he’s very playful, he’s not anxious or stressed as he runs up to me and Merlin and immediately lays down and shows us his tummy he’s eating and drinking normally and his pee smells and looks absolutely normal. I’ve also talked to a vets office about this and told them everything that’s going on and they agree it’s unlikely he’s sick (I have very little income and am unable to actually take Arthur in right now for a urine analysis)

The boys are beyond spoiled. They have multiple scratching posts and cat towers literally dozens and dozens of different types of toys. I have 3 water dishes for them in different places of the apartment they each have a bed and pet heating pad that stays on 24/7 on a low temperature. I’m home all day everyday because of my disabilities so they’re showered with attention and love. I play cat tv for them anytime I have to leave the house too. They eat quality food and plenty of treats and wet foods too. As of now I only have one litter box but it’s a huge one 24x36 that gets scooped daily and emptied every week then deep cleaned every month. I use natural litter too so it doesn’t hurt their delicate paws.

So, I beg of you if you made it this far what to recommend next beside getting the urine analysis (I know that needs to be done it’s just not an option right now) can anyone please provide any insight because I’m losing my damn mind!",1,1765086914.0,cats,0,1.0,False
1pgavqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeckDeutschland/comments/1pgavqf/ultimate_perfection_of_life/,ultimate perfection of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

He was a 12 year old chihuahua terrier mix. He'd been with me since I was 8, and I just turned 20 in September- we grew up together. 

He had a growth coming off of his heart and more in his lungs. I know that his quality of life would've been awful if I'd chosen to put him through chemo and surgery, which the vet told me would only give him a couple more months anyway. I couldnt do that to him, especially not after watching him get worse over the course of 13 days (I found out about the growths on Nov 20th and said goodbye on Dec 2nd). I know I made the right decision for him and guilt isn't why I'm making this post. 

I miss him so much. I miss waking up with him snuggled against mt chest. I miss taking him outside to go potty while I started my car for work. I miss taking him to my moms for the day and having him run to me when I walk through the door after work. I miss his personality and how I could have literal conversations with him and the way he'd look at me with understanding in his eyes. I miss taking him on walks around the neighborhood.

Its still hard to comprehend the fact that hes gone and I'll never get to see him again in my lifetime. On the top of his head there was always this comforting scent, I cant really describe it but it reminded me somewhat of coffee. The last of that scent is gone from my blanket now. I keep going through my camera roll to see him in photos and videos. The only way I can ease the tightness in my chest is to distract myself, and I know that's the best advice anyone can really give me but it doesnt feel right. Because when im distracted, it feels like a normal day where ill look over my shoulder and see Ringo napping on my bed. But I dont see him anymore, and the feelings crash into me twice as hard as before.

I've always had issues with shortness of breath but its worse now. I cant sleep without him next to me. Without fail, I wake up at 2am and its a gamble on whether I can go back to sleep. My appetite was never great but now its almost nonexistent. Eating is just another distraction for me. My cats have noticed and been more clingy than usual and I appreciate them but its not the same. 

I guess I'm posting because I'm looking for guidance and comfort. I've never liked to ask for help but I need it. This is the one event in my life that I cant handle alone. ",5,1765086780.0,Petloss,2,1.0,False

I saw a post on it by Kismai and one person recommended it. Then it went on sale so I figured why not! I had several wool and cashmere sweaters I had thrifted (see: strong scents, certain smells or stains, etc) that I needed to wash.

I was skeptical of it initially because there had been some spillage in the bag it shipped in… the smell was so strong I almost gagged.

Well, it’s hella concentrated. I used the barest amount to hand wash in my sink and tbh it reminded me of a Spa Day™️. The cream sweater I bought with a coffee stain on it became brighter, softer, and stainless. The water became gross. After a few rinses (no citric acid, I forgot) the smell was very faint. My clothes are very soft and feel very clean. The overwhelming scent of Tide is gone from certain sweaters and a pleasant odor remains even after several wears.

Highly recommend IF strong scents are not harmful to you or your household. If you wash a lot of wool a lot of the time it may not be economical, but for someone like me a bottle will easily last me… possibly forever lol. The detergent itself is extremely concentrated and smells like it. My clothes smell very faint after (hand) washing & rinsing though. I am a little bummed to have washed all my sweaters already lol.

(This is far from sponsored, I even had to pay shipping for my order 😭)

After two years of putting in effort to meet someone, I’ve reached the point where I’m just done and I never thought I’d find myself feeling this way.  

During my time on Hinge, I dealt with:  

* A guy who led me on while hiding the fact that he was living with a long-term partner  
* Another who ghosted me to go and marry the fiancé he was hiding 
* Coffee dates where I wonder why he even bothered to show up  
* Messaging so lazy it’s basically one word or an emoji   
* Guys who put in the bare minimum and still expect something to come out of it   

It’s exhausting, demoralizing, and honestly feels absolutely pointless.   

So I deleted Hinge and decided to stop actively looking for a relationship. I’m shifting my energy back into myself, my career, my goals, my routines, my hobbies, the parts of my life I can actually control and that actually give something back.   

I’m questioning if after all this time, I’m completely done with dating. I feel completely done with putting effort into a system that just doesn’t seem to work for me no matter how hard I try.   

I’m curious: has anyone else reached this point? Did stepping away from dating apps or dating in general make life better, worse, or just different? How did things unfold for you once you stopped trying?",4,1765086296.0,datingoverforty,12,1.0,False

1pgao73,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pgao73,Rosacea/Acne,"Hi everyone,

I'm hoping for some insight because l've been confused for a long time.

Originally I thought I had hormonal acne since I used to get severe breakouts across my cheeks and jawline, left with scarring and PlE. I cleaned up my diet and lifestyle, and those deep cystic breakouts stopped (thank gosh!).

Hormone tests also came back normal, so I think a lot of it was actually stress or environment-induced.
It's been about a year since I had a major cystic breakout, and my skin routine/diet are extremely clean and gentle.

But I'm still getting red inflamed bumps mainly on my cheeks, with constant redness and sensitivity. I feel my skin never gets a proper break from inflammation aka no time to truly heal the PlE.

I've just come home from 7 weeks of travelling and my skin flared up quite badly so it looks a bit worse than usual.

• Cheeks get very hot and red, almost flushed after heat, sun, or humidity
• Breakouts triggered by warmth, sweat, or sun exposure
• Diffuse cheek redness with small red bumps
• Gentle routine + clean diet (no dairy, sugar, gluten) | quit coffee and cigs a few weeks ago bc I know they are very heating.
• Never used acne or rosacea meds before

Now I'm starting to wonder if this might actually be rosacea or a rosacea-acne combo.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

He’s 26, quiet, culinary grad, and he’s currently trying to open a café. In person, he gives so much boyfriend energy that it actually surprised me. The first time I visited, he gave me cookies he baked himself. The next day, he made me matcha and iced coffee while we sat together on his couch. He was soft, warm, and easy to talk to. He even invited me to go to a party with his friends that same night, like he was comfortable enough to bring me into his circle almost immediately. He shared about his past relationships, his work setup, even the trauma from his last ex. It all felt very intimate and natural.

But the moment we’re not physically together, he becomes a completely different person. Dry replies. Hours or even a day of silence. Sometimes he doesn’t reply at all, even though he’s active on Ig. Recently, he left me on seen. And it hurts more than I want to admit because when we’re together, it feels like something real could grow. But online, it feels like I don’t matter.

I was even planning to bring him pastries from a bakery in my hometown this weekend, not as a clingy move, just something thoughtful because he’s into pastries. But now I’m second-guessing everything because I don’t want to seem desperate or cross boundaries if he’s clearly pulling away.

I know I’m young, but I’m tired of hoping for something real only to feel disposable in the end.

1pgailu,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1pgailu/year_in_review_with_the_mazzer_philos/,Year in review with the Mazzer Philos,"I was one of the first people in the US to get the Mazzer Philos and I have used it basically everyday since the first day I got it.

I was coming from a Niche Zero when I purchased this grinder. What I wanted was a grinder that had a similar work flow to the niche zero, had a wider net of flavors/clarity and had little to no retention 

I think overall it achieved two of those things, I will say the work flow is a bit more tedious with having to open/ close the hatch so it is not as smooth of a work flow. I’d probably had better luck with the Lagom P64 in terms of the work flow, but I was able to get in at the limited run price of $995 instead of the $1400 price it is at now so for the price I can’t really complain about it. As for retention, it can hold up to .5 grams even after using the knocker. If you’re switching back and forth with brew methods constantly, the dose finisher is almost mandatory to use. I have seen other people not complain about the retention so I’m assuming the wipers in the grinder might have some inconsistencies. If you stay with a grind setting you’ll start to see the retention issues decrease with time and will then get to .1-.2 with just using the knocker.

For burrs, I went with the i200d’s as I wanted to have a better time sensing the tasting notes and overall I think they did a pretty decent job. I  purchased a comadante c40 a few months ago and have done a side by side tasting and I’d say the Philos is almost 1:1 taste wise with it in comparison. Bright and Juicy cups that had some clarity to it.

One of the things with the burrs for me personally was that I wanted to be able to go between pour overs and espresso, but in terms of pour overs I found that it was making too many fines for my liking and resulting in a lot of muddy beds. Mazzer recommended around the 80 marker for pour overs but I found that I had to get up to 100+ (600ish microns)which felt pretty frustrating to me as I had to go pretty coarse to get a brew that didn’t stall on me.

So about 5-6 months in, I decided to purchase some SSP MP’s and installed them. If you’re looking to swap burrs in the Mazzer Philos, be warned as the burr carrier is very specific to the shape of its own burrs and there is some play involved when installing the SSP MP’s and took a couple hours of getting them to the right spot. So being able to “play” with burrs will be a challenge if you don’t know what you’re doing (I sure as hell didn’t).

After getting the new burrs in, the Philos turned into the grinder that I was wanting. I had more room to play with grind settings with pour overs, and I still have ample amount of room for espresso and being able to hit 9 bar using light roast.


As for the cleanliness of this grinder, it can be pretty messy. You’ll sometimes get clumps of excess coffee grounds that drop out of the shoot even after using the knocker and it usually happens after I get my grounds in the portafilter and I tap the portafilter on the counter. 

For how the grinder is built,I think it’ll probably live longer than me. For the most part, it is heavy duty. For the plastic bits on the stand it’s pretty disappointing as everything else is basically metal. I love the low hum of the grinder it is not annoying to listen to as to how the Zerno Z1 is a whiner. It is incredibly easy to access the burrs and clean everything out and with its built you don’t have to zero in your grinder every time you’re cleaning it which is a huge plus for me. 

Would I buy this grinder again? Well it depends. If I was getting into this grinder at the sub $1000 price I wouldn’t hesitate. If I’m forking up $1400 for it, I might look elsewhere. Such as the Lagom P80

1pgahl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1pgahl1/torn_about_quitting_my_barista_job/,torn about quitting my “ barista “ job,"hi , first time posting here , but i’m looking for advice regarding my current work situation .

i go to college in a small town , im in my first semester and landed a job at a local coffee shop . its very popular , i see a lot of my classmates and professors so its helped establish some connections with my peers outside of school . i have a year of previous experience in coffee and just finished up my gap year where i was an assistant manager at a ice cream shop . 
when i started , the owner had me train at their smaller location in the next town over for about a month . she seemed to like me enough , even if she wasn’t there too often . she’s very touchy about who’s allowed to run the espresso bar , and promised to train me faster than others due to my experience . however we had some staffing issues and i wasn’t able to get a training shift under my belt before switching to the closer , busier location . this location had a larger menu and i had to learn how they do things differently at this store before i got trained . for 2 months in a row i was told over and over again “ we’ll train you next week “ and it never came . 
now , here’s where the real problems start . something odd about this workplace is instead of the owner letting everyone know about a change during a meeting or in the groupchat , she’ll tell one person and ask them to tell others and hope it travels , like a telephone game . this carries on in how the employees communicate , which creates a very gossip and rumor oriented environment . one of my republican coworkers found out i was gender fluid and started to not like me . knowing she would come off as a bigot gossiping about this , she decided to create rumors and tell people that im a terrible worker and rude . this got back to the owner , who began to yell at me and blame me for things going wrong in the store , even if i am not on the station the mistake happens on . she tends to be intense with everyone , but despite being excommunicated from the group , my coworkers have pointed this out to each other and recognize im being treated unfairly . apparently today after the owner had chewed out one of my coworkers , he remarked he wished i was there so i could take the heat because the owner dislikes me the most .

i have started to struggle in school due to the anxiety surrounding this job . i have anxiety attacks before , after , and sometimes during my shifts . it’s odd to be in a position like this , as one year ago i was in a higher position and respected across locations at my last company . and now im not allowed to operate the espresso machine at a coffee shop job despite a year of experience and 5 months at this job .

the reason im torn is my coworker who is my friend is insistent that i shouldn’t quit , and it’ll get better . even if it does , i don’t know if i can hold out until then . my other coworker is encouraging me to quit and says i even have a right to no call no show tomorrow because of how ive been treated . 

i’ve always been a “ two weeks notice because its the right thing to do “ kind of worker , but im considering telling my manager i’m not working past what’s currently on the schedule .

i think i have my mind made up , but im looking for advice or understanding otherwise . thank you for reading !

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

- Call was scheduled for 9am. The interviewer (who also happens to be the CEO) eventually called at 9:30. Just said he lost track of time. 

- He clearly didn’t read my resume. He said something to the effect of “obviously you’re still working…”, to which I replied no… I got laid off in June. He asked if I would be open to a casual interview and to show me the work space over coffee and asked my availability. I provided my availability for the following week, and he immediately says “ok, so tomorrow at…”.

- He asked if I was married/had kids citing that if you’re not happy in your personal life you’re not going to be happy at work. He later said “pretty sure I shouldn’t talk about this, but we’re a young company. We are all 27-38. We love fresh ideas”

- The job posting said they have a new office in my city. I asked where this office was since I didn’t find it on their website. Turns out they have not secured an office site and are operating out of a shared co-working space. 

- There is only 1 other employee that has been hired so far at the location I would work at

I’ve had 5 interviews since June but no offers. I’m not desperate yet, but I feel like the longer I wait, the worse it looks on my resume.

Been making moves, dream journal, mindfulness, shadow work, the whole nine yards. At this point I feel well initiated.   
Let's begin with the recent encounter while it's still fresh in my mind. I suffer from a minor substance abuse issue, I believe that's relevant since such factors can have powerful sway over the unconscious. Woke up early, got crawings, after a while (a little less than an hour), I decided to leave and get coffee from town.  
Now, it's before the crack of dawn. To silence my complaining nerves, two very specific people would have to be in a very specific place, at the exact right time.  
And so they were.  
The chances of this are practically nonexistant. These types are not exactly known to be early risers, and they had little to no reason to be there. I did inquire about it, and it turns out they were woken up by crawings of their own. Non-related, but timely.

  
Now, let's get to the implications. Personally, I operate on ""Mind over Matter"" basis. Reality can at least be affected, if not created, by strong forces of concentrated Will. The very foundation of occult practices for instance. At least that's how I see it. This is uncharted territory, who knows for sure?  
So, ironically my lack od self-control leads to this concentration of will. Time had probably effect as well. I had that hour to marinade. 

Mostly I'm just thinking aloud. Perhaps this could be directed. Our species has a lot of rituals, most symbolic in nature. In my framework, these practices would be for concentrating the unconscious will. Telling your mind in symbols, that stuff is about to go down, and so it does.

That's about all I got for now. Thank you for your time.

One day she tell me she wants to have a baby, I of course object since we still had no relative means to support ourselves let alone a child we had no jobs no car and barely a place to stay since my friends father who owned the house we were living it didn’t know we were there I told her how I don’t see myself as a good father since I barely had my own in my life I even bought her a pet turtle to satiate her paternal wants, nothing worked. Then one day she hit me with an ultimatum “either you have a baby with me or I’m going to leave you and have one with someone else” i felt like I had no choice so I broke and we had kids. Fast forward to the present I decide to do the right thing and marry her on the beach in Florida. Soon after we start living together on our own I get a job at a grocery store for minimum wage didn’t care so long as I could provide for my family I had to ride a bike given to me by my father in law because I still had no car and had to cross a highway just to get to work. We end up leaving that apartment due to complications and move into another, I quit my job and get a better one at a home department store but I don’t let that stop my duties at home I did all the cleaning made sure to  help with the kids when she felt overwhelmed and made meals for the kids and even her sometimes. But when it came to her contributing, nothing. I could barely get her to clean up behind herself on a good day if ever, the fights still happen, the disrespect of me as a person and my boundaries still present. One day I get laid off from my job but fortunately the same week my wife starts working at a coffee shop I continue business as usual but full time always with the youngest two since one was in school, cleaned when I could and cooked meals. Her however most days when she’d get off work she goes straight upstairs and stays in our bedroom all day either to sleep or just lay there.  I’m still cleaning all the messes making the meals being there for her while she ignores me and how I feel. The fights get worse Then one day she drops a bomb on me “I don’t think I want to be married to you anymore” my heart sank, panic sets in she tells me it’s because I failed to provide certain criteria she’s asked for the past few years. I feel like I’m in the twilight zone, this is the same woman who pulled my firearm on me during one of our fights in front of our youngest child and yet still I try to find every solution to make her feel better and more secure in our relationship. One day we have a fight because she wouldn’t wash her dirty dishes when she finally decided to cook for the family I asked her too on one occasion, days go by it’s been so long flies start to circle I get fed up and tell her to just get some more dish liquid so I can do it for her, more days go by then finally I had enough I explode we have a hug fight and she moves out. 8 months go by I get my old job back with higher pay, i get my drivers license and am now saving for another car since I get one before but it broke down but nothing changes. One day we finally have a real conversation about why she wants the divorce says it’s not really because of me rather her. She realizes she never got to live on her own never got to be her own person and then claims she still wants the divorce but that she still likes me and wants to be with me. The problem is I’m at the point where I’m convinced she’s lying. She’s still divorcing me, moved out, says she doesn’t even want to have sex with me claiming she’s not ready for that and has on record told me to my face that she doesn’t respect me or trust me. I’m convinced she’s just keeping me around so she doesn’t feel guilty for everything she’s done. I’m at a point where I just want to run away and go, leave all this behind me and never look back for any reason am I the asshole for feeling like that?

Consciously seeking kindred spirits. Perhaps even my forever and always. But hey, even that kind of solid connection is best founded on the grounds of *pakka* friendship, don't you think? Forever is a long time, might as-well spend it with your best friend for life.

I just want someone to call my own. To talk about anything and everything with, to chat the day away, watch movies / binge on shows with each other, explore the city and cute cafés together, A genuine connection of mind, body and soul. My person, us against the world.

I’m 29, fit body with a sharp mind and a creative soul. A lover of all things nature, food, and animals. I’ve got messy hair, a dimple on my left cheek, and eyes that see deeper than most.

Witty banter, endless memes, and conversations that go far beyond the surface. I don’t want just passion, I want emotion. I want romance. I want chemistry that sets us both on fire.

I want to be your favorite notification and your go to distraction. I want to make your heart skip a beat when you see my name pop up on your screen, make you smile from cheek to cheek and bite your lips at the same time.

For unless it's mad, passionate, extraordinary love, it's a waste of time. There are many mediocre things in life, love should not be one of them.

So how do we do this? Coffee in a cute café filled with gingerbread smells? A day spent talking till the lights come on? A Christmas movie marathon with fuzzy socks? Let’s connect. Let me get to know you.

**AITA for blaming my fiancé for Thanksgiving being a disaster?**

**Editor’s note: made small edits for ease of readability**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/pFB7ATLSfG): **November 27, 2025**

I'm sitting in my pajamas, fuming about this whole thing, and my fiancé is acting like he holds no equal footing here. I need to know I'm not crazy.

When I was about 4 years old, my parents introduced me to their friend ""Rose"". She started spending a lot of time with us and eventually, moved in. They were always very close friends and she was very good to me but I didn't think anything weird of it. A lot of people I knew lived with family, so I thought it was like that. When I was a pre-teen, they explained to me that they were all together. Not polygamy or a sister wives situation, but Rose was in love with and dating both my parents. It was a little jarring but I accepted it and honestly, it didn't change much. Rose was still one of the people who helped me with homework, pitched in with dinner, taught me how to ride a bike, etc. She was there for every big moment, even the sad ones. The only thing that changed is they started kissing one another in front of me, but nothing gross, just the typical parent pecks or whatever.

I knew this wasn't the norm for every family. My friends were fine with it when they found out. Not all of their parents were as understanding or accepting, but we were old enough that we could see each other outside of our homes and it didn't impact me a whole lot socially. Twice, I had a boyfriend who found it weird, but it was revealed early on in our relationship, so it wasn't a huge heartbreak.

I've been with my fiancé for the past 3 years, we've been engaged for 1. When we started dating, I explained my parents and he was cool with it. He's hung out with them and spent holidays with us. His family lives across the country and they haven't been able to fly out to visit much, we've only afforded one trip there since I started dating. The first time I was meeting them, I asked my boyfriend to tell his parents about my parents and Rose, and let me know what they said. He told me they were completely fine with it. Every time we saw each other, it never came up specifically, but I would mention Rose in passing and no one batted an eye. So, I figured all was fine.

This year, his parents were able to fly out for Thanksgiving. My fiancé and I were hosting. My parents and Rose were coming too. Again, I think not much of it. Everyone's under roof, everything's nice and merry. Then, at some point I go to check on food and when I come out, things are noticeably awkward. Fiancé’s parents, my parents and Rose all look uncomfortable. Fiancé looks annoyed. I ask what's wrong, but no one will tell me. I awkwardly announce it's time to eat, and the meal is quiet, outside my parents and Rose engaging with me. Fiancé’s parents leave for their hotel as soon as we're done eating, and don't bother to stay for dessert. I'm even more confused.

My mom eventually pulls me into the other room and explains that while I was checking on the food, she, my father and Rose were talking about a trip they're taking. Fiancé’s parents looked confused and fiancé’s mom asked ""Rose is going with you?"" My mom had said ""of course"", which seemed to disturb them. My mom then said she explained they were all in a relationship together, and that even further disturbed them. She told me she was hurt I lied that his parents were okay with them. It wouldn't have changed that they came, but they would've been more careful to not make it awkward. I told them I didn't lie at all, my fiancé told me they were okay with it. She apologized for accusing me, and I apologized she went through that. She, my dad and Rose left not long after that.

My fiancé and I got into a huge argument after this. He said he didn't know how to tell them, so he just didn't. I told him he's been lying to me for 2.5 years, and put everyone in an uncomfortable position. I asked what his parents thought, and he had told them Rose was my ""aunt"" who lived with them to save on rent. I asked him what he expected to happen. My parents and Rose aren't making out and in people's faces, but when they're in what they assume are safe spaces, they act like they're in a relationship. He claims it's all on his parents for being weirded out and making it awkward. I said no, this is on him. He lied to everyone and made it terrible for everyone. Sure, his parents could've acted normally and they are at fault for not recovering and trying to have a nice meal...but he's still moreso at fault. He just doubled down and said he didn't do anything wrong.

He is now mad at me and says that I shouldn't be blaming him for this, and instead should just be mad at his parents. I am just so confused and lost, and wondering if I'm going crazy by being mad at him.

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP received mixed reactions, but mostly leaning toward NTA**

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Your fiancé is so obviously in the wrong here, for exactly the reasons you identified. There's not even any evidence his parents were embarrassed about the polyamory. They could have just as easily been embarrassed that **their son had lied to them.**

> **OOP:** Yeah, I haven't spoken to them so I obviously don't know their thoughts. If it was just a lot to deal with at once, or if they felt embarrassed for initially being nasty about being confused over Rose attending the vacation.

**Commenter 2:** OP, I’d text or email and tell them you’re sorry they didn’t know, that you asked fiancé to tell them your family dynamics several years ago when you first started dating, and he told you he had and that you had no questions or issues. You didn’t find out until Thanksgiving that he’d lied, and as a result there was confusion and awkwardness. You’re sorry they weren’t made aware of the unusual relationship before coming face to face with your parents and Rose and being embarrassed by not knowing the facts, and for the ensuing uncomfortable and awkward atmosphere. That way you’re not apologizing for your parents and their choices, because it’s not your responsibility and there’s nothing to apologize for, and you’re putting the blame squarely where it belongs, on the guy that was too embarrassed to discuss a throuple with his parents and lied for years to cover that up. NTA

> **OOP:** This is a good idea. I'll reach out to them in the morning.

**Commenter 3:** NTA.. your fiancé is at fault for lying . I won’t blame his parents on their reaction. You are going to see similar reactions in future if you decide to move on .. your normal won’t be other people’s normal. So be prepared to wait longer for the special one where him/family will be comfortable with this situation. Hoping you are able to resolve this with him and he accepts who you/your family are.

> **OOP:** I won't be surprised if they're uncomfortable. As I said, I've dealt with this before with other people, so it's not the end of the world. My family and I have learned to navigate that. It's just the fact that he lied and put us all in a situation that made it awkward.

**Commenter 4:** NTA-Is he usually adverse to having difficult discussions? I would not say this is 100% a dealbreaker, but it would raise questions about his ability to face tough things/conversations. He dropped the ball in not having the conversation with his parents, lying to you about it, and how he reacted after.

> **OOP:** This is the first time I've caught him lying about something, but he does tend to avoid conflict. He is one to usually just agree with something, just to end the conversation. We've been working on it and I've told him it's okay if we don't agree on something. He doesn't have to bend to what I (or someone else) wants. He can have opinions too. But in general, he just says ""I'm not bothered one way or another"" when it comes to most things, which can be frustrating, especially here.

**OOP clarifies the relationship between her parents and Rose** 

> **OOP:** I said it's not polygamy, which is when they are there to serve the man. They're also not claiming to all be married to one another. It is polyamory.

*(editor's note: polygamy is the practice of being married to multiple spouses (man with multiple wives). polyamory is a form of consensual non-monogamy that involves having multiple romantic and/or sexual relationships at the same time, with the full knowledge and consent of everyone involved)*

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/7jOBtILI8Y): **November 28, 2025 (next day)**

UPDATE ""AITA for blaming my fiancé for Thanksgiving being a disaster?""

Hey everyone, so I’m here with an update. Before I got into how the talk with my fiancé’s parents went, I want to answer some questions that a lot of people kept asking:

1) Why didn’t I tell his parents myself about my parents and Rose? This was a deceent point. While I still don’t believe it is my fault for what occurred, I did understand the POV that this was MY situation, MY family, and it’s something at minimum we should’ve done together. I guess when it comes to situations like this, people’s parents finding out about my own, usually friends, they just do it for me. It’s not something I ask them to do, they usually ask me permission before our families meet and I say yes. I thought it’d be easier if my fiancé told them before our arrival so it wasn’t just me word vomiting “Hi, nice to finally meet you! By the way, my parents are in a polycule.” But, looking back, yes, I can acknowledge, I should’ve offered to tell them as a couple. That being said, if he felt that uncomfortable doing it alone, I wish he would have told me.

2) Do his parents think my parents and Rose are related? I feel really stupid for not thinking about this at the time. In my family, “aunt” is a term used loosely. It doesn’t mean “parent’s sister”. I have a lot of “aunts” and “uncles” that aren’t related to my parents biologically but were close, influential figures in my life, thus the titles. So, when I found out they assumed Rose was an “aunt”, my mind just went to “family friend”, but Jesus Christ…realizing they probably thought this was a Flowers In The Attic type situation, no shit they freaked out! I feel dumb for not even considering this.

3) Some have said that this situation is unusual and even if they don’t assume this is a Folger’s coffee holiday commercial, it’s natural that they may need a minute to process, or that they may never accept it at all. Many asked about religious or cultural reasons. His family isn’t religious nor do they come from a conservative culture. That being said, I can understand why this is odd to people, and why they may need a minute or have a hard time accepting it, even without those things. I think I just got protective of my parents and Rose in the moment, especially seeing how hurt my mom was in that moment. Yes, she’s “used to it”, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t sting when you are rejected. We’re all human. At the end of the day, everyone is entitled to their own opinions. I am also entitled to my feelings. I totally understand not everyone will accept my family. That doesn’t mean I’m not allowed to be hurt by it. If I can’t police anyone else’s feelings, that goes two-fold.

4) Someone asked “What if you never found a partner who accepted this? Or what if you never found a partner who’s family did?” And the truth is, I don’t need their family to accept it. Just be respectful. A for a partner, I thought I had found one who was, and even if I never did…well, I’d rather have my family any day.  

Anyway, onto the update. As per point #2, I realized the context they were lacking may be playing a part. So, early this morning, I texted and asked if we could meet up and talk. They were all for it. I went without my fiancé, as we still weren’t really talking. We met for breakfast and the first thing I asked was for them to give their side. As most of you expected, the weirdness and judgement they were giving was because they assumed Rose was my mom’s sister. They actually seemed relieved when I explained the whole story and are supportive. They want to properly re-meet my family, which I said was sweet. I didn’t want to get into the whole “I don’t know where your son and I stand” as that wasn’t their problem.

 However, his mom did clarify “So, (fiancé’s name) knew the real story this whole time and lied?” I was honest and said yes. I said maybe I should’ve made sure he actually told them, but his dad actually interrupted and said if he promised to tell them, then it was on \*him\* to say it. They were both very disappointed in him. They actually said what a lot of you did, even if he lied for all this time, he should’ve spoken up when things got awkward and smoothed out the situation. Or even grabbed me to. They felt even worse, but I told them it wasn’t their fault. Given the context of the situation, I don’t blame them for acting weir. The meeting ended on a positive note. We were all supposed to have lunch later on, but given everything with my fiancé, I didn’t feel great about going, so I had him go alone. I told his parents ahead of time, and they understood.

When fiancé came back from the lunch, he apologized. He said he wasn’t sure how to tell them and kept meaning to. He also kept hoping it would “naturally come up”. I pointed out it wasn’t that he just didn’t tell them, he actively lied. Of course they never suspected Rose was anything more than an aunt in my stories, because that’s the lie he planted. He was sincere in his apology. But then he mentioned he got a tongue thrashing from his parents, and I wonder if he would’ve apologized had they not told him what a jerk he was.

I said I understood if he felt weird about telling them, but he should’ve told me. We could’ve navigated shit together. Instead, he let it explode, then did 0 to help clean it up nor did he take accountability until mommy and daddy scolded him. He made my parents and Rose look bad, made me look even worse, and most importantly: he lied to me and his parents for 2.5 years. How am I supposed to trust him again about anything? I listed some of the examples you guys gave. He got quiet and said he understood, but he wanted to rebuild the trust. I asked if he was really okay with my family dynamic and he insisted he is. He says he loves my family and really has no issues, he just didn’t know how to tell them. I said I want to believe him, but you can never fully trust a liar again. He asked what we could do to fix this. I said I needed time. He offered counseling and I said I’d consider it.

We had started planning our wedding a few weeks ago, but that has been put on hold indefinitely. I had been living with him since the engagement but I’m back with my parents and Rose for now. I have to decide if this is something I can live with going forward. It’s only been a few hours, so I genuinely have no idea if I can forgive him for this and move on. One person said “Hopefully this’ll be a funny story one day, remember the Thanksgiving where your parents didn’t know who Rose was?” And I don’t even know if I could ever get there. I love him. I thought he was my person. I don’t want to throw it all away, but I need space. If we move forward with the relationship, we will absolutely be going to counseling. I told him even if we break up and I don’t go, he needs to enter therapy for his conflict avoidance. He didn’t disagree. He also called my parents and Rose to apologize. They were civil, but I know they are not happy. Fiancé’s parents, however, have invited them out to a do-over dinner before they head back to the west coast, and with my blessing, they’re going. It’ll be nice if they can be friends after all this.

That’s where we are. Everything is so fresh and I still don’t know what I want yet. Going to take the holidays to reset and rethink about a lot. Thanks for all the advice.

**Relevant Comments** 

**Commenter 1:** I'm glad you're hitting the brakes on things and taking time to process and work on mending rather than either a; going scorched Earth and break up or b; rug sweep. 

The taking a step back and working on rebuilding is a very healthy route and hopefully will lead to a healthier relationship down the road.

> **OOP:** Thank you. It's eye roll inducing how some are like ""You're throwing everything away!"" I'm taking a breath to think. It's only been 24 hours. It's rational to need a minute.

**Commenter 2:** 

> He also kept hoping it would “naturally come up”.

He’s lying about that too. He knew it would never “naturally come up”, because people just don’t ask if their child’s partner’s parents are in a polycule, especially with someone they think is a relative.

> **OOP:** Exactly this. When did he think it would ever come up??

**Commenter 3:** You know what's really wild is that his parents are being perfectly lovely about the polycule, which means your fiancé didn't even have the tiniest little excuse for not telling them the goddamn truth in the first place! He just didn't wanna!

So he lied for 2.5 years, set everyone up for a disastrous meeting, and then sat on his hands and let everyone twist in the wind!

I can't imagine trusting this guy ever again. I'd  say you'd always have to worry about him crumpling when the going gets tough, but he actually crumples when the going gets...mildly inconvenient. Life is too long and too full of ups and downs to have a partner who doesnt even try. 

> **OOP:** This is what drives me crazy. He knew they would likely be cool with it, and instead, he lied for no reason. I'd have more sympathy if he had very conservative or religious parents. I'd get it. But they are the exact opposite.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/s/OwPfBep5ys): **November 4, 2025**

My (24F) and my husband (24M) have been together for nearly 4 years and have 1 child together (2F). We decided around a year ago that we needed to sort out our will to ensure our daughter had a stable life, should something happen to us. The wills that we had written, states that our daughter would go to my Father (50M), however he’s got various health conditions which could mean he might not still be around if something like that were to happen. As a backup plan, we’ve stated that my husband’s parents (51F & 60M) would get her.

Over the course of the last few years, MIL’s behaviour has been steadily declining, she’s been acting like she’s in her 20s, going out partying every weekend, doing illegal drųgs, instigating arguments with husbands siblings, etc. I believe she’s developed a bit of empty nest syndrome which has lead to these situations, although my husband said she was an alcoholic when he was growing up.

About a year ago, she had been out partying on the Friday night and did some illegal stuff, then the next morning she was watching our daughter for us. She hadn’t told us that she wasn’t sober when we dropped daughter off and we only found out at pickup because she said to husband “Oh yeah I had a fun time last night, I got to do ‘Coca-Cola’”

To say we were angry was an understatement. My husband was the one to pick up daughter so he explained to her that we would’ve rather she’d told us, we wouldn’t have gone out but there would’ve been someone sober watching daughter. He told her that if she ever watched our daughter while under the influence again that she wouldn’t be able to have her alone anymore.

I didn’t realise until daughter got home that MIL had also given her first haircut without permission and threw away all the hair because “her hair was bothering her”. Husband didn’t realise the haircut would be an issue until they got home and I saw her hair. I was livid but MIL feigned ignorance, saying she “didn’t realise first haircuts were a thing” and that she “didn’t take off much” (daughter went from having nose-length hair to micro-bangs).

Taking into account that she had been doing ‘Coca-Cola’ the night before, she’d been drinking ‘adult sodas’ during the day, and she had scissors so close to daughter’s eyes pushed me over the edge and I lost it. It turned into a huge argument between me and husband, mostly because he originally tried to say it was him that cut her hair. When I was said that I KNEW it was MIL that did it, he started trying to defend MIL, he wouldn’t stand up to her. It’s now something that gets frequently brought up in a mocking way by MIL with a smirk on her face.

Fast forward to last weekend, MIL had organised a family get together for FIL for his 60th birthday and had also invited some of his friends and work colleagues as well (MIL and FIL both work in the medical industry). We arrive on time but we weren’t the first there, Husband’s younger brother (20M) was first to arrive with his partner (20F).

YBIL *(editor's note: younger BIL)* went to the bathroom while SIL sat on the couch which looks into the kitchen. MIL was in there, pressuring FIL into taking something to which he gave in and she saw them take some ‘LakeSideDrive’ each. Shortly after, we arrived and said hello, then Husband’s older brother (25M) and his partner (30M) arrived. Last we talked to them there was a bit of a fallout so we went into the back garden to give them some space to say hello to MIL.

While we were outside SIL told us what she’d seen and was saying that she was upset that they’d do something like that for a family gathering and asked what we thought (we were the only ones there with kids).

OBIL *(editor's note: older BIL)* and partner came out and after eating we asked them if they already knew to which they said they did. When we asked how they knew, they changed the subject but after a little while longer of talking, they revealed that MIL had specifically told them what her and FIL did, and that OBIL and partner were told not to tell me and husband that MIL and FIL weren’t sober.

We were so angry that we just wanted to leave but we also didn’t want to upset FIL at his birthday celebration. After people started leaving, we made an excuse to leave with them. It did take a while as the combination of the ‘LakeSideDrive’ plus ‘adult sodas’ caused MIL to have a bit of a break down and start crying about how she never sees us.

Husband and I have had a chat and at this point we’re not comfortable with MIL and FIL having daughter alone. We don’t know if they’re frequently taking drųgs outside of party situations, but we overall think it’s disrespectful that they wouldn’t want to be lucid for when they see their granddaughter (they don’t see her much as we try to make plans but they always have something else to do). On top of this, they knew we’d have an issue with them doing what they did to the extent that they told people not to tell us specifically. Additionally, MIL knew we’d had a falling out with OBIL so might’ve been banking on us not talking or OBIL wanting to keep it to himself out of spite.

Now husband and I are assessing whether we still want them as our backup in our wills as, clearly, they’ve broken our trust. Husband hasn’t talked to them about the weekend incident yet, he is still so angry and upset as he’s been the one defending MIL to his siblings and me the last few years.

I’m trying to get some unbiased opinions as MIL has done quite a few things in the past to make me not like her and my mother doesn’t like her either so I don’t know whether that’s clouding my judgement.

Would we be overreacting by changing our wills to have our backup as my mum instead (she’s not already as she lives overseas)?

Thanks in advance.

**Update:** Thank you everyone for your advice. We saw our lawyer on Monday and discussed with her what we wanted to be changed.

It was really hard for husband and he was quite depressed. He knew it had to be done for daughter’s safety, but it’s just shitty that it was even something we had to consider doing.

We’ve had our wills changed to name my mother and stepfather as daughter’s guardians if we’re not around. The main thing the lawyer needed to confirm for that was whether we wanted daughter to move to them, or them to move to here. We’d already discussed them doing the latter so that’s what will be put in.

Someone suggested we specifically exclude MIL and FIL from being potential guardians, which we suggested to our lawyer. She said that she wouldn’t advise us including that in our will, as wills become publicly available after a person’s death. She instead suggested that we leave sealed letters for our executors, outlining that we wish for MIL and FIL not to be her guardians and why. In that instance, the information would only become public knowledge if they tried to ignore our wishes and get custody of daughter, as the letter could be used as evidence in court.

Husband also changed his executor from MIL to a close friend. We see friend every week for games night, and he was husband’s best man at our wedding. He’s got a good connection with daughter, she was born the same day his mother passed, and he’s said that her birth gave him hope in a very dark time. Because of this connection, we know he would ensure our wishes are taken into account and she’s in a safe and stable home.

MIL and FIL still have not contacted us. Normally MIL would ring husband every few days to check in, but it’s been over a week now and still nothing.

OBIL stayed when we left, so we’re thinking that he probably mentioned to them that we knew about the “LakeSideDrive” and that we were pissed. If that is the case, they’re probably trying to wait out husband’s anger and hope that it blows over and he forgets about it.

I know that some of you were saying that what we were asking was a no-brainer, but I honestly think this steady decline has somewhat desensitised us to the sųbstance use. We were gaslighting ourselves into thinking that maybe it was a harmless thing and that we were overreacting, so having our thoughts validated has been a weight off our shoulders.

Thanks again to everyone who commented. Your help has been HUGELY appreciated!

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** The obvious answer is no. This is YOUR child and it’s YOUR responsibility to ensure your child’s well being. If you know your in laws are irresponsible substance users, why is it even a question for them to get your kid should something happen to you? Your kids well being and safety will always trump family feelings.

> **OOP:** Thank you, I think Husband and I might be gaslighting ourselves into worrying that it’s less of an issue than we’re making it out to be. Also as I said, she’s done some unsavoury things towards me previously so I wanted to make sure the decision was made with an unbiased intent. 

**Commenter 2:** Holy crap, the way I would cut these people out and never trust them again! I’d make them do a piss test before and after watching my kids, IF ever let them see their grandkid(s) again, and it would be at my house with cameras and not until my kid was old enough to call me. Your kid could get into their substances, I’d never trust my kid at their house!

> **OOP:** We’re of course hesitant to cut them out completely as MIL didn’t technically go against what husband said, she wasn’t responsible for daughter at that time, but at the same time, she knew we wouldn’t like the situation. We’re definitely not going to be leaving daughter with her anytime soon but we just weren’t sure whether changing our will over 1 incident over the past year would be an overreaction. Thank you for your input. 

**Commenter 3:** Think of this scenario I'd like you to imagine. You will pass away your fil and mil are taking care of your child, they leave stuff around your child finds a baggy coca cola and decides to try it. Because when a person is high, they don't pay attention where they put their stuff down .can you imagine your child taking these drugs and dying also, because that's what will happen. If you leave your kids with a drug user. You need to cut them off a hundred percent until they can be sober and take dope tests to be around your child. They made a choice knowing you didn't want your child around it. That tells you they don't need to be around your child.And they know they're doing wrong by getting high and lying.

> **OOP:** I definitely hadn’t thought of it that way! My mind was more on the ‘high person wouldn’t notice her if she climbed into the oven’ sort of mindset, but of course the stuff being left around would be an issue too! Thank you for your input. 

**Commenter 4:** How are any of the siblings yours or your husband’s with kids? If your concern is that your father is getting old, a back up could be someone more your age?

> **OOP:** Our concern is less about his age and more about medical problems. He’s got a heart condition and has already had multiple heart attacks but he’s first choice because we live with him and it wouldn’t be a huge change in that she’d stay living in this house and with the family she’s grown up with. He’s happy to take care of her and thinks he’s capable of it but it’s more of a peace of mind thing to make sure that if he’s not around that there’s another good option too. Thanks for your ideas. 

**Commenter 5:** Is there a reason why you aren’t considering siblings as possible guardians? With bad health on one side and safety issues on the other, neither side’s grandparents are a good fit. Plus they will be in their 70s when your daughter reaches 20.

I have a cousin who was raised by our grandmother. No matter how much you love a child, at such an advanced age there are a lot of things that are simply harder or not possible. I filled in when I could but it wasn’t the same as being present at all times.

> **OOP:** His siblings don’t want kids and I’m not that close with my older siblings. Of my younger siblings, the oldest is 17 and the youngest is 11 so they’re not exactly options at this stage. Thank you for your input though, that’s a perspective we’ll have to consider.

[AITA for losing it at my MIL because she tried to gaslight my husband into thinking he was overreacting?](https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/s/nLqlh48FY7): **November 20, 2025 (2.5 weeks later)**

This is a follow up to a previous post where I (24F) explained about my husband (24M) and I wanting to change our wills due to in-laws’ drųg use.

We finally received the dreaded call from MIL (51F), after only 3 weeks of no contact 🥴. She called to ask if she could have daughter (2F) next week, as it’s her friend’s son’s birthday. We were in the middle of dinner so husband said he’d call her back later.

We finished up and my father (50M) watched daughter while we went to a separate room to talk to MIL. The conversation started with husband saying that he wouldn’t be comfortable with her having daughter unsupervised, to which she responded that she understood, no questions asked.

He started explaining to her that we didn’t appreciate the drųg use when we were over for FIL (60M) birthday and that we knew that she said specifically not to tell us.

She tried to explain away saying “oh well it’s not something we wanted broadcast to all the guests” and that she figured we “wouldn’t care because she wasn’t responsible for daughter” to which we were able to respond with “why mention us by name then rather than just saying ‘don’t tell anyone’”

She eventually confessed, saying that she didn’t want us to know because “we’d judge them” and that they didn’t want any “big reactions from us”.

She continued on talking in loops, making out that husband was being selfish because what did we expect when going to a party, that clearly we had the problem because we were invited to their house, they could do what they wanted in their house and they were able to make “adult decisions” such as using drųgs.

Yes, we have no issue with them doing what they wanted in their house. The issue is that they did it then tried to hide it when they knew other people wouldn’t be okay with it. We don’t want to be around it and we don’t want our daughter around it, and she knew that. They also didn’t portray it as a “party” it was advertised as a “Sunday lunch celebration” otherwise we might’ve been more skeptical going in.

She started talking about my grandmother who’s an alcoholic, saying that we’re fine with daughter being around her (which we’re actually not, I’ve seen her maybe 3 times since Christmas 2023 for this reason but that’s a whole other problem).

She then went on to say that we shouldn’t worry about it, if we’re such prudes, she’ll steer clear of anything questionable or addictive, she started by mentioning wine but then doubled down saying “oh wait, coffee has caffeine, caffeine is addictive, better steer clear of that too”

I could see she was really starting to upset husband and make him second guess as to whether we were overreacting so this might be the part where I’m an AH. If I feel like someone is threatening me or someone in my family I can really loose my sh\*t, and that’s exactly what happened.

I started with “WTF is wrong with you? WTAF is wrong with you that you think this is okay? This is disgusting behaviour and you know it. You would never let any of your kids at 2 years old around someone who was high, you would’ve lost your sh\*t, so why would you do that to your granddaughter and then expect us to be fine with it?”

I was beyond furious at this point so I was screaming in to the phone. I think she was a little taken aback by my presence because she thought husband was alone.

She responded with, “I’m not gonna respond to yelling”. I went to another room to cool off for a bit before I went back to listen again.

She was saying about how FIL wanted to do the drųgs as a 60th birthday present to himself and that “it may be hard to hear when you’re in your 20s, but it’s not about you”. Cool, we don’t care what they do in their own time, again, we don’t want our daughter around it, and she knew that. If that’s what he wanted to do, by all means, go ahead, we’d see him another time.

She then started to go on about how she loves daughter and that she wished she could see her more (we’re always the ones trying, she’s always busy partying), and then proceeded to talk about paying for daughter’s swim classes. At that point I butted in again to say, “Okay thanks, you no longer need to worry about that as it’s not going to be a point you can manipulate.” She then tried to backtrack after I said that, and said she was just meaning that she cares.

The call continued with her trying to make excuses and manipulate husband into thinking that we were wrong for our reaction. When I’d jump in, she’d make comments about my being too involved, what did she actually expect? This is my family we were talking about, my very conflicted husband and my 2 year old daughter! She tried talking about how upsetting it was that we’d reacted like this but “oh don’t feel guilty” which I think was an attempt at reverse psychology. I just reiterated that we didn’t feel guilty, we were acting in the best interest of our daughter.

She finished by saying that what we want to do is our decision, and that what she does won’t affect anything of what we think of her. She was effectively trying to say that we’re the ones with the problem, not her, to try to make us feel guilty. She’s obviously never heard the expression “Actions speak louder than words”.

I called her out, saying that her behaviour on the call had been manipulative and absolutely disgusting and husband said something to the tune of him not recognising her anymore, said goodbye and hung up.

Husband was understandably distraught afterwards, he’s a very passive person and he was waiting until she called to say something to her about the drųg use. I was telling him how to word his responses to her while they were talking but he’d just let her cut him off which is probably another reason I jumped in, cause she just kept talking over him and not letting him speak.

This has been kind of playing on my mind as I’m not a really an angry person, I try to be kind and considerate, so when I do lose my sh\*t, it tends to stick with me. I did talk with husband and apologised for butting in but he thanked me for backing him up. So AITA for calling out MIL on her bull?

**Editor's note: OOP has posted the same update onto another subreddit, I am adding relevant comments from that subreddit for more context** 

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I would be very anxious that my child would eat “a candy” at the grandparents’ house. With them being high as kites they probably wouldn’t even notice and the child might get really sick or even worse (don’t even want to type it here). I wouldn’t forgive myself as a parent if I could’ve prevented it by not letting someone who takes drugs frequently watch my child. 

> **OOP:** Honestly this was one of the biggest things on our mind at FIL’s birthday, we were seeing MIL walking in and out of the house, grabbing random stuff from different bedrooms like lollipops (don’t THINK they were drug ones though), cigarettes, etc. We just had no idea if they had stuff throughout the house that daughter might find, so it ended up with us locking every room in the house and watching her like a hawk. 

**Commenter 2:** NTA but I’m curious why you even think another answer is possible. Your mother is entitled to her second or third teenage party years if she wants - or maybe this is the first one and she never rebelled before - but she isn’t entitled to endanger anyone else while doing so, most especially a child.

She can go to hell in her own. I’d limit contact and say no not only to her being alone with your child but anyone in the family who takes her side in this, because they can’t be trusted not to hand your kid off.

> **OOP:** To be completely honest, I’ve never thought it was normal but the way this has been going we’ve gotten so used to it that it almost feels like the norm. Husband and I are both quite passive people and we’ve been quite the people pleasers most of our lives. Like I said, I’m not an angry person, but if you make me angry, I tend to go into a rage. I’ve tried to be respectful of husbands family dynamics and not meddle in their family drama so in 4 years I’ve never really called MIL out on anything. I’m honestly just in such foreign waters and MIL is an avid manipulator that I was just really unsure as to whether I was genuinely being an a-hole. 

**OOP on her husband's behaviors toward his parents' issues**

> **OOP:** He’s optimistic and sees the best in everyone. It’s a quality I love about him but unfortunately people take advantage of. I definitely don’t blame him for the way things are. I know it’s an incredibly difficult situation for him to be in and he’s been having a very hard time. I think he’s at the stage where he’s grieving the idea he had for his mother because now he sees her for who she is. 
> 
> He’s not that great at reading people so he didn’t even realise that what she was saying was intentionally trying to make him feel guilty, he started picking up on it when I started calling it out and he was starting to call her out on it by the end too, which I’m proud of him for.  Thanks for your input.

[AITA for losing it at my MIL because she tried to gaslight my husband into thinking he was overreacting?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pah46x/aita_for_losing_it_at_my_mil_because_she_tried_to/): **November 30, 2025 (10 days later)**

Thanks everyone for the advice and opinions on my previous post. Updating as a few asked.

TLDR for Part 1: In-laws (52F & 60M) took drugs at family get together for FIL’s 60th birthday. My husband (24M) and I (24F) have 2 year old daughter who was also present at the lunch. There’s previously been issues so MIL told people not to tell us they were high. We’re not comfortable with her having daughter now.

FIL called my husband on Friday to say he wanted to catch up to have a chat on Sunday about the current situation. We went in skeptical but eventually agreed to get a coffee with him on Sunday Morning.

On Friday, MIL transferred us money for daughter’s swim classes. We promptly returned it as that was one of the leverage points she tried using in our phone conversation with her. This lead to her to add herself, FIL, husband, and I to a group chat to berate us about not accepting the money. Husband explained that we didn’t want to accept any more money from her but she wasn’t satisfied with the response and was asking FIL to back her up. FIL didn’t say anything in the chat as we were going to be talking to him on the Sunday.

This morning (Sunday) we received a passive aggressive message from MIL with a picture of the invitation for the birthday party she wanted to take daughter to, trying to make out that we should feel guilty that daughter is missing out.

The conversation with FIL was interesting, to say the least. For the first approximately 10-20 minutes, he was talking to us as if there was no problem at all. After our food had arrived at the cafe, he abruptly changed the topic by saying “Okay, we need to talk about your mum.”

We started by asking how much she had actually told him, and unsurprisingly, it was just information that she had skewed to make herself seem like the victim. We have previously had extensive conversations with MIL about not wanting daughter around drugs, this was not information that had been passed on to FIL (not that it should really matter because surely that’s a no-brainer).

FIL also hadn’t been made aware of the fact that OBIL was told not to tell us specifically by name.

FIL mentioned that he didn’t think MIL was using the money as leverage so we started going in to details of the phone call (he works night shifts so wasn’t home at the time of the call).

Finally, we mentioned to him about a message that MIL sent to all husband’s siblings. The message outlined that MIL couldn’t trust any of them to keep secrets to themselves and that now none of them can trust what she says because she’s never going to be truely honest again (definitely not the way to regain the trust of your grandkid’s parents 🥴).

We told him that the biggest issue wasn’t even the drug use, it’s the lack of respect for our wishes and the consistent lying and lack of remorse for the whole situation.

He started trying to come up with excuses for her behaviour, saying that she’s had a hard life and that she’s got an addictive personality, etc. but as we kept telling him how she’d been acting, he slowing started to agree that her behaviour has been completely inexcusable.

Eventually FIL was asking what it would take for us to let MIL have daughter again and he was trying to ask us to “build a bridge” for his sake, as he’s the one that has to put up with her persistent whinging.

We told him that she’s broken our trust and she can’t even admit that she’s got a problem and that until there is some kind of breakthrough in her life, she won’t be having daughter. We told them that they can still see her with us present, at a neutral location.

FIL continued pushing by asking whether they’d be able to have her without us if he was around to keep an eye on MIL. We explained that it wouldn’t be an option as he is too close to MIL, and knowing her, she would be able to convince him to leave for an hour or two. We said to him that it wouldn’t be a fair situation as that would be asking him to choose between the wishes of his kid and his wife.

He then was trying to say “well what if you get assurances from her that she’ll be sober for the 24 hours before watching daughter” to which we told him that she’s broken our trust so her assurances hold no weight for us.

He then steered the conversation in a very strange direction, asking if we knew about MIL’s sexuality. We’d previously talked to husband’s sister, who said, during one of MIL’s drunken rants, MIL was talking about previous sexual conquests, and her best girl friend’s (BGF, 60?F) name had come up. We mentioned this and said that we didn’t think much of it at the time as Sister and MIL don’t have the best relationship, so we thought she was just making up gossip (that and we really don’t care what MIL wants to do in consensual situations). We mentioned what sister had said to which he nodded as if he was confirming what we were saying, and went on to say that MIL had been unfaithful to him, so he no longer wore his wedding band.

I’m not exactly sure the reason he even brought up the infidelity to begin with, but on further reflection, I think that was his way of saying “well I don’t trust her, but I still put up with her, and you should too.”

We explained to him that although she’s been unfaithful to us in a different way, we still have a similar feeling to what he explained, there will always be a sense of doubt as to whether she’s actually being honest, or just saying what we want to hear.

By the end of our conversation, he seemed like he fully understood the situation, what we are upset about, and what MIL had been doing. We were pleasantly surprised to have him on our side, although realised later that he never actually apologised for his part in the situation, he mostly came up with excuses for it. As we were leaving, he gave us a hug and told us to be safe and keep daughter safe.

We had told them both our piece and given them the opportunity to explain, so we believed all conversation regarding the situation had concluded.

We were wrong.

FIL called us while we were eating dinner and seemed quite detached and squirrelly. He was saying that he’d talked to sister and that she hadn’t recalled talking to us about MIL and BGF *(editor's note: MIL's best girl friend)* and he was asking where we’d really heard that, as it was untrue. We reiterated that it was something we heard from sister and we’d only brought it up because he’d asked. It wasn’t something we had spread around, let alone even mentioned to anyone else and at the time we mentioned it, he was acting as if it was something he was confirming and knew about.

This line of conversation lead to “Well clearly there’s been a lack of open honest communication and we just need to bridge the issue and get back to normal.”

Husband and I were both confused because he’d offered that information just today, without prompt, and it seemed like he was trying to relay as if that was the main problem for the current situation.

Husband told FIL that he was confused as to how that had anything to do with the current situation and why we’re upset.

He didn’t really have a good response for that, and started going on a tangent about how it was unfair that we would judge them for what they’d do, when we don’t judge my parents for the decisions they make.

When Husband and I first found out I was pregnant, we weren’t married yet and our families hadn’t met so MIL and FIL invited my dad and step-mother over for drinks and lunch so they could get to know each other. Dad and S-Mum were there most of the day, right up until after dinner, so they did go through a bit of wine but they were also eating and dad didn’t have as much as S-Mum as he knew he had to drive. This was one of the things FIL brought up as being something we should judge my dad for, as he’d been drinking and drove home. He doesn’t actually know what our reaction was at the time and that was over 3 years ago! My dad is the most loving and playful grandad you’d ever meet now.

The point FIL said we should judge my mum on was that she didn’t get the COVID Vaccine. This argument point honestly just puzzled me as, not only has it been proven to not work and cause different issues, I wouldn’t have gotten it if it wasn’t so severely mandated in the country I live in. (We’re not anti-vaxxers btw and I don’t need opinions of vaccines in the comments)

After FIL came up with these examples, I stepped in and explained to him that he was “completely missing our point” (likely intentionally). We explained that we’re not judging them for what they want to do in their own time, we’re upset about the betrayal of trust and blatant disrespect for our wishes.

After I finished speaking, FIL said “Well, just to let you know, we’ve changed all the locks on the house and only your mum and I will have the key, and since we’re no longer going to be looking after our granddaughter we don’t need any of her things at our house so you can organise a time with us for you to come retrieve them.”

Husband said to them that that’s fine and that we could do that if they wanted us to and the conversation ended quite promptly after that.

The entire phone call we could hear MIL in the background, we couldn’t hear exactly what she was saying but we think she was just telling him what to say. Also, the entire time, it sounded as if he was on something but we weren’t sure whether he was quite drunk or had taken more drugs. The way he was acting made us think it was drugs rather than drinks, just as he was being about as comprehensible as he was when he’d taken LSD at his birthday party.

If any further drama happens when we go to pick up daughter's things, I’ll update again, but honestly we’re just hoping that we can sort it without issues because we’re so beyond wanting to worry about this.

If you’re still reading, thanks for making it to the end.

Edit: My friend is not from Ukriane but from a country that had a brutal war.


He is a really nice guy and we talk every week.

This week though he was different when I asked him what happened he told me he got sent a booklet on how to prep in case there is a war.

Now him being a refugee becaz of a war this really really freaked him out a lot.

I told him not to worry and that the potential to have a war with Russia isn’t so high but he must be prepared and that’s why the booklet helps.

Yet this hasn’t calmed his fears at all and now all we talk about is news and Russia and the war situation in Ukraine and the possibility of war.

He thinks I’m way downplaying the issue saying the government in the Netherlands doesn’t lie and won’t make stuff up. I told him sure it won’t it just wants you to be prepared that’s all…

Any ideas on how to try to help him be more calm? ( seriousness aside I even told him go visit a coffee shop!).

Is it really that worrying of a situation do you guys think there might be an upcoming war ?

- Dots honey mustard pretzels, apples, nuts
Hobbies and/or Interests
- Hiking, spending time with my pointer cross, gardening/growing edible plants
 
This is what a coworker said that works a little closer to her : she talks about her dog a lot! I do believe she drinks coffee. She talks about her needing coffee from time to time 😊.  She just came out here and was showing me her new socks and canvas shoes, she got this weekend. Said she likes to wear “fun and funky” socks! Which she has shown me on several times the socks she is wearing that day 😊.


Ideas??? I’d like it to be a nice gift she will enjoy and not feel like I didn’t put thought into it. I’ve put a lot of thought in but can’t decide.

I have got rid of my POIS symptoms 100% naturally in just a couple of months. 

I have nothing to sell to you. I am sharing this because it is thanks to this community that I have figured out how to alleviate my symptoms. 

I will try to make it short.

# Context 

Around a year ago I started having POIS symptoms. It started with GI issues for me. 

Then a couple of months ago, it’s got really bad. I could not function for 3 to 4 days after an O and I would be in serious pain. These are some of the symptoms I had:

- GI issues: very bad constipation, mucus in stool, bloating, reflux, etc.
- Pain: Terrible aura migraine for 2 to 3 nights after an O and Muscle aches. 
- Cognitive issues: inability to focus, memory issues, difficulty to find words, etc. 
- Sensory issues: sensitivity to light, feeling too hot or too cold, etc 
- Mental health issues: depression, mood swings, etc.

I am not going to list all the symptoms, but you get the idea, I had it pretty bad, and I was even scared. 

# The information that helped me 

I was initially leaning toward the opioids theory, which states that pois is similar to withdrawal, etc. 

I then read a Reddit post where someone mentioned a link between leaky gut and POIS. And it’s made sense to me. Because for me, it started with GI symptoms. So I did some research in this direction.

I learned about SIBO (bacterial overgrowth), how it can cause leaky gut, diet to heal leaky gut, reduce intestinal/colon inflammation, and improve gut microbiome. 

# What has helped me 

I first did 30 days abstinence. I then tried to O and did not feel sick the first day. I tried again the second day, and got really sick. And it even lasted longer than usual. 

This is when I decided to focus on gut health. I followed a strict diet for 3 weeks. This diet eliminates most high FODMAP foods, all grains starch and legumes, dairy products, refined sugar, processed foods, and even eggs.

The aim of this diet is to feed the good bacteria and avoid feeding the bad bacteria, and allow the gut to heal but avoiding inflammatory foods, etc. 

For 3 weeks, here is what my diet looked like:

- 7 fresh dates and black coffee for breakfast 
- Wait 4 hours no food 
- Chicken and vegetables for lunch 
- More dates and coffee 
- Chicken and vegetables for dinner 
- Some fruits as a dessert or roasted almonds with maple syrup 

In terms of vegetables, here is everything I could have: carrots, courgette, fennel, aubergine, green bell pepper. I would just steam cook them, add some virgin oil.

In terms of fruits: dates, bananas, oranges.

In terms of meat: mainly chicken, I tried red meat a couple of times, and it did not feel safe. I think just stick to chicken for 3 weeks TBH. 

Forget about grains and legumes. No rice. No bread. No oats. No beans. Nothing. Not even pseudo grains like quinoa. This is critical. You don’t want to touch this stuff with a leaky gut. This is the hardest part. Most of us love pasta and bread, etc. And grain makes most of our foods. But trust me, it’s worth it. Just 3 weeks. For your health and healing.

No dairy as well. That should not be a big deal. 

You should avoid any vegetables and fruits I did not mention in the allowed list above. And stay far away from onions and garlic. 

Avoid eggs as well. I know, it sucks. 

IMPORTANT:

- My instinct is telling me that the morning dates played a huge role in my healing. You need fresh ones and not the dried ones. They replace the carbs and sugar intake, give you energy, all the nutrients you need, feed the good bacteria, and help restore the gut lining. I eat anywhere between 7 to 13 a day! Read about dates and don’t skip them…

- The 4 hours no food after breakfast is non negotiable. This allows your MMC (Migrating Motor Complex) to activate. This thing cleans up your GI, and help remove bad bacteria where they should not be, etc. Critical. At least once a day. You should do twice a day sometimes (don’t eat before bed). 
-  Sleep: don’t expect to heal anything without good sleep. 8 hours needed. And sleep after 3 AM is NOT sleep. 

# The results 

I stress tested this lol. 2 Os a day for 3 days. Almost no symptoms at all. No GI issues, which is my number 1 signal. No pain or migraines. No cognitive issue or lack of energy. Nothing. I barely got a bit sweaty and overexcited in day 4. Could be light symptoms. Not sure. 

# What’s unclear 

Is it the diet? Or is the abstinence that helped? There is no way to prove. 

But as the participant of this experience, and judging by my symptoms and how I feel, it’s 100% the diet that healed me, and my gut was the issue. 

# My plan for the future 

I am now slowly reintroducing some foods. I eat white rice (fresh, not reheated), I can also have some bread, some wheat based cookies and cakes, or even pasta etc.

However, grain now makes 20% of my diet. Like a treat. Once every other day. And never in the morning. I mean priority to healing foods. 

Now the next step is to figure out how to treat the SIBO properly. This is another battle that will take time I think. I am already seeing progress thanks to the changes in diet, but there is so much into it. So I have to take some tests, and find a good doctor, etc.

Unfortunately I cannot share everything as it’s getting too long now. But I will definitely write more in the future if I have more helpful info.

In terms of abstinence, I plan to keep doing it. The benefits are great. 

# Last tips 

- Preps is critical for this type of diet. Otherwise you will find nothing to eat and will turn to bad foods 

- It’s ok to fail once or twice. I have failed a couple of days. But you need to take it seriously. 

- Duration depends on the damage level, so try 3 weeks and see how you feel… 


# Conclusion 

Please try the protocol exactly as explained above. And please make sure you come back here and let us know if it worked for you or not. Hopefully we can help each others and all get better.

Also, stop treating your body like a pharmacy box. Supplements are not even regulated. And medicine can cause even more issues. Be careful with that. Always try the natural way first. 

And finally, you are an adult, you are responsible for your health. Don’t follow this protocol if you have health issues, etc. Maybe speak to a doctor if necessary. 

Good luck, fam.

1pg9jfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1pg9jfe/aita_for_wanting_to_get_myself_some_sleep_and_not/,AITA For wanting to get myself some sleep and not do the morning routine with our nearly 3 month old son.,"So to put this into context here me and my girlfriend have been getting into a lot of heated arguments as of late. Our sone will be 3 months old in a couple of weeks and he is my whole world.

So she is a stay at home mother which is fine I have no issue whatsoever with that that is her own choice. I work and I work night shift work.

So our current schedule really is because I work nights anyway I find it easier to look after our son the entire night while she sleeps, I tend to stay awake as I am a very heavy sleeper so for efficiency sake I choose to stay awake, she may get up for a couple minutes to help soothe him if I have to run downstairs to make a bottle for a feed but then I take over let her go back to sleep. But on the whole she gets a full nights sleep of anywhere from 6-8 hours with 1-2 times of consoling for a couple minutes as I said while I’m making up a bottle.

So come 6-7am I am really hanging in there, eyes are heavy and by then she’s getting up to start her day she’ll go downstairs get the heating on in the living room make herself a coffee etc and I even will come down stairs change our son, and then feed him then let him settle but as it’s the morning he will be a lot more demanding and a lot more fussy but I tend to try and get him placid to put him in his Moses basket which I will then take myself up to bed for me to get some sleep and it’s around 9-10am at this point of the day and I have my alarm set for 2:30 and 3pm.

So here comes the friction, she says she’s struggling and screaming up to me for help because our son is crying and screaming and generally being a fuss which I tried to explain to her I’m in a different room and floor of the house it’s not gonna wake me up and then berates me for sleeping in all the time while she struggles in the morning she can’t have anything to eat or drink or do anything but just give him attention and soothing while I sleep away.

I tried not to be petty but I sort of was when I pointed out to her of the 24 hours of the day I’m usually doing 14-16 hours of it with him while she’s free to sleep and do what she wants in the day “usually she just reads books on the couch” and of his 8 bottle feeds I am doing around 5-6 of them and doing more than half his nappy changes.

I’ve kept a lid on it for my sons sake but the berating and saying I’m lazy is constant when I’m the one who’s works and I said to her she is acting like our son is burden on her and I don’t understand why she finds it so hard when I’m doing the exact same thing on some days and I don’t find it hard at all. Then I get told I’m a horrible lazy person and f you this and that. All while my son is in the same room by the way which I know he’s 2 and half months old but still I really will not stand for that.

I’ve even secretly recorded her when she is shouting at me and it is VERY nasty. I know it’s kind of deceptive but I had to show my sister what I was dealing with and ask her am I crazy to think I am doing something wrong here.

I get it a lot to when I say something like “I’m tired” or “My head/back is hurting” it’s usually met with yeah so what so am I which again comes across as just dismissive.

I’ve come VERY close to packing all her stuff up and asking for my house key back and kicking her out. She isn’t on the tenancy and we are not married so I know wherever she goes my son would have to follow but I’m more than prepared mentally at this point to be done with her have my son 4-5 days a week on rotation for equal time and just solo it. That part however I’ve only internalised and never made it a point because there’s a part of me hopes it can get better.

I’m at a loss and don’t know if I am being a a hole in this scenario as any attempt to confront her on almost anything it’s met with tears and self pity and being belittled and dismissed.",7,1765082464.0,AITA_Relationships,5,0.89,False
1pg9jds,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1pg9jds/obd_code_diagnostic_assistance/,OBD Code Diagnostic Assistance,"My car is already booked for a service (unrelated to this) so I will end up getting this looked at in about 7 days, but I still wanted to seek advice as I will need to continue driving it for the next week, and want to make sure it is safe to do so.

I have a 2016 Mustang with some mods and a tune, (E85 and 93, but currently running the 93 tune). I went for a good 3hr spirit drive today with some friends, and at some point in the second half, I started feeling some sluggishness (weak acceleration + a noticeable feel and sound to it). We stopped for a coffee for a bit then kept going, and the sluggishness was gone. But right when I was on the way home, that same sluggishness/feel/noise returned.

I read the DTC codes, and they returned P0325, 0330 (both knock sensor related) and 0355 (ignition coil on Cyl 5). I thought the problem was with the 0355 code, so I swapped that coil around with one next to it, and took it for a drive again. The 0355 error did not return nor did I feel the sluggishness, but the 0325/0330 ones remained. I did fill up earlier today, but am 99% sure I used 93 and not some lower octane.

Is it possible my car is actually knocking? or is it more likely just bad knock sensors? Am I safe to keep driving (carefully) for the next week until I can get it looked at professionally?

Edit: Looking into the codes more, I think I misunderstood the 0325/0330 codes, and it does not necessarily mean my engine is knocking, just that the sensors themselves are bad. These codes may have been there for a while as I haven't read the DTC codes for months, and no check engine light came on for any 3 of the codes, and I guess the sluggishness is related to the 0355 code (that seems to come and go? would that be heat related, since I drove spiritedly for a long time?). Is my best course of action to just replace the knock sensors and harness and see if the codes go away?",1,1765082460.0,MechanicAdvice,2,1.0,False
1pg9iep,https://www.reddit.com/r/RetatrutideWomen/comments/1pg9iep/my_accidental_reta_od/,My accidental Reta od,"So I finally got some Reta 10mg. I did all my homework, got my supplies, reconstituted it, and was ready to go. I drew up the entire 1.0 mL syringe and injected it. I didn’t think anything of it until a few seconds later when I realised I was absolutely not meant to do that. My dyscalculia was so focused on the reconstitution that I completely tunnel-visioned the dose and thought, “Yep, same as the recon.” Yes, I know — what a DUMBASS move.

Almost immediately I panicked. I knew it was wrong. I Googled again and realised I’d really messed up. My heart was racing, my head felt weird and delayed, and everything felt slow. To make it worse, I was at work at 10am and had to raw-dog it until 2pm when someone could cover me.

The first three days were horrific. For the first two days, I was throwing up every hour. My body was aching, I couldn’t stand for very long, and the smell of food made me gag. I could only tolerate drinking cold water. I felt sunburnt on steroids. I was weak and couldn’t sleep — for the first three days I was only sleeping in 30-minute intervals and constantly restless from the aches.

On day 4, I finally managed some toast. I literally hadn’t eaten for three days. By day 4 I was still extremely weak, with aching from my hips down. My skin was so sensitive that being touched felt painfully weird. I took 7 days off work in total as I literally could not stand for long periods I was thinking how the hell am I going to operate?? my brain feels dead my body is dead ☠️ 

Every day after day 7 I got a little less achy. Today is day 12. I’m eating one or two small meals a day, but since yesterday I’ve been having this morning vomiting reflex where I can’t stop gagging. I tried going to the gym but felt weak. My knees down still feel sunburnt, but it’s not as noticeable.

Some of my habits have completely changed. My morning coffee doesn’t taste the same — whether I make it at home or buy it. I don’t crave the foods I used to eat. I was heavily counting macros and super invested in the gym, but now I feel like I don’t want the foods I used to prep, and all my healthy habits feel like too much effort. I don’t want chicken, I don’t want to weigh things… I just feel lazy across the board.

I’ve lost 5kg — down from 60 to 55. I can still go without eating, but I am eating. And yeah… this mistake hammered me into my soul. Jesus Christ, have I learned my lesson.

I’m grateful for the signs, but I’m trying to manifest several thousand, not coffee money.

Do tiny wins mean I’m close and just stabilizing the vibration? Or is there still a belief that big money is harder?

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

    Such a hothead.
    I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
    I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
    That's why we don't need vacations.
    Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
    Well, Adam, today we are men.
    We are!
    Bee-men.
    Amen!
    Hallelujah!
    Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
    please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
    Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.
    That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!
    Will we pick our job today?
    I heard it's just orientation.
    Heads up! Here we go.
    Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
    Wonder what it'll be like?
    A little scary.
    Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
    This is it!
    Wow.
    Wow.
    We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
    Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.
    Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!
    That girl was hot.
    She's my cousin!
    She is?
    Yes, we're all cousins.
    Right. You're right.
    At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
    These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
    What do you think he makes?
    Not enough.
    Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
    What does that do?
    Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.
    Saves us millions.
    Can anyone work on the Krelman?
    Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.
    But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
    But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
    The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
    What's the difference?
    You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
    So you'll just work us to death?
    We'll sure try.
    Wow! That blew my mind!
    ""What's the difference?""
    How can you say that?
    One job forever?
    That's an insane choice to have to make.
    I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
    But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
    Why would you question anything? We're bees.
    We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
    You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
    Like what? Give me one example.
    I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
    Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
    Wait a second. Check it out.
    Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
    Wow.
    I've never seen them this close.
    They know what it's like outside The Hive.
    Yeah, but some don't come back.
    Hey, Jocks!
    Hi, Jocks!
    You guys did great!
    You're monsters!
    You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
    I wonder where they were.
    I don't know.
    Their day's not planned.
    Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.
    You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
    Right.
    Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
    It's just a status symbol.
    Bees make too much of it.
    Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
    Those ladies?
    Aren't they our cousins too?
    Distant. Distant.
    Look at these two.
    Couple of Hive Harrys.
    Let's have fun with them.
    It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
    Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!
    He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!
    Oh, my!
    I never thought I'd knock him out.
    What were you doing during this?
    Trying to alert the authorities.
    I can autograph that.
    A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
    Yeah. Gusty.
    We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
    Six miles, huh?
    Barry!
    A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
    Maybe I am.
    You are not!
    We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
    What do you think, buzzy-boy?
    Are you bee enough?
    I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
    Hey, Honex!
    Dad, you surprised me.
    You decide what you're interested in?
    Well, there's a lot of choices.
    But you only get one.
    Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
    Son, let me tell you about stirring.
    You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.
    You get yourself into a rhythm.
    It's a beautiful thing.
    You know, Dad, the more I think about it,
    maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
    You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
    That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
    Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
    Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
    I'm not trying to be funny.
    You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
    You're gonna be a stirrer?
    No one's listening to me!
    Wait till you see the sticks I have.
    I could say anything right now.
    I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
    Let's open some honey and celebrate!
    Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!
    I'm so proud.
    We're starting work today!
    Today's the day.
    Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
    Yeah, right.
    Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
    Is it still available?
    Hang on. Two left!
    One of them's yours! Congratulations!
    Step to the side.
    What'd you get?
    Picking crud out. Stellar!
    Wow!
    Couple of newbies?
    Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
    Make your choice.
    You want to go first?
    No, you go.
    Oh, my. What's available?
    Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
    Any chance of getting the Krelman?
    Sure, you're on.
    I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
    Wax monkey's always open.
    The Krelman opened up again.
    What happened?
    A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
    Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
    Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
    Oh, this is so hard!
    Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.
    Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
    Barry!
    All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
    What happened to you?
    Where are you?
    I'm going out.
    Out? Out where?
    Out there.
    Oh, no!
    I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
    You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
    Another call coming in.
    If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.
    Hey, guys.
    Look at that.
    Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
    Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
    It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
    Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
    Sign here, here. Just initial that.
    Thank you.
    OK.
    You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.
    So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.
    Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.
    Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
    That's awful.
    And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!
     All right, launch positions!
    Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
    Black and yellow!
    Hello!
    You ready for this, hot shot?
    Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
    Wind, check.
    Antennae, check.
    Nectar pack, check.
    Wings, check.
    Stinger, check.
    Scared out of my shorts, check.
    OK, ladies,
    let's move it out!
    Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!
    All of you, drain those flowers!
    Wow! I'm out!
    I can't believe I'm out!
    So blue.
    I feel so fast and free!
    Box kite!
    Wow!
    Flowers!
    This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.
    Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
    Roses!
    30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
    Stand to the side, kid.
    It's got a bit of a kick.
    That is one nectar collector!
    Ever see pollination up close?
    No, sir.
    I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.
    See that? It's a little bit of magic.
    That's amazing. Why do we do that?
    That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
    Cool.
    I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?
    Copy that visual.
    Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.
    Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?
    Affirmative.
    That was on the line!
    This is the coolest. What is it?
    I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
    It smells good.
    Not like a flower, but I like it.
    Yeah, fuzzy.
    Chemical-y.
    Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
    My sweet lord of bees!
    Candy-brain, get off there!
    Problem!
    Guys!
    This could be bad.
    Affirmative.
    Very close.
    Gonna hurt.
    Mama's little boy.
    You are way out of position, rookie!
    Coming in at you like a missile!
    Help me!
    I don't think these are flowers.
    Should we tell him?
    I think he knows.
    What is this?!
    Match point!
    You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!
    Yowser!
    Gross.
    There's a bee in the car!
    Do something!
    I'm driving!
    Hi, bee.
    He's back here!
    He's going to sting me!
    Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!
    He blinked!
    Spray him, Granny!
    What are you doing?!
    Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.
    I gotta get home.
    Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.
    Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
    Ken, could you close the window please?
    Ken, could you close the window please?
    Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out.
    Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
    What was that?
    Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!
    That is diabolical.
    It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
    What's number one? Star Wars?
    Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.
    No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.
    When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
    There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
    I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.
    I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.
    Wait! Stop! Bee!
    Stand back. These are winter boots.
    Wait!
    Don't kill him!
    You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!
    Why does his life have less value than yours?
    Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?
    I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.
    My brochure!
    There you go, little guy.
    I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.
     Put that on your resume brochure.
    My whole face could puff up.
    Make it one of your special skills.
    Knocking someone out is also a special skill.
    Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
    Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
    Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
    You could put carob chips on there.
    Bye.
    Supposed to be less calories.
    Bye.
    I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something.
    All right, here it goes.
    Nah.
    What would I say?
    I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.
    I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to.
    Oh, I can't do it. Come on!
    No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.
    How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good.
    Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
    Hi!
    I'm sorry. You're talking.
    Yes, I know.
    You're talking!
    I'm so sorry.
    No, it's OK. It's fine.
    I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed.
    Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.
    This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!
    I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me.
    And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.
    That was a little weird. I'm talking with a bee.
    Yeah.
    I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!
    I just want to say I'm grateful.
    I'll leave now.
    Wait! How did you learn to do that?
    What?
    The talking thing.
    Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up.
    That's very funny.
    Yeah.
    Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
    Anyway... Can I... get you something?
    Like what?
    I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?
    I don't want to put you out.
    It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
    It's just coffee.
    I hate to impose.
    Don't be ridiculous!
    Actually, I would love a cup.
    Hey, you want rum cake?
    I shouldn't.
    Have some.
    No, I can't.
    Come on!
    I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
    Where?
    These stripes don't help.
    You look great!
    I don't know if you know anything about fashion.
    Are you all right?
    No.
    He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.
    He finally gets there.
    He runs up the steps into the church.
    The wedding is on.
    And he says, ""Watermelon?
    I thought you said Guatemalan.
    Why would I marry a watermelon?""
    Is that a bee joke?
    That's the kind of stuff we do.
    Yeah, different.
    So, what are you gonna do, Barry?
    About work? I don't know.
    I want to do my part for The Hive, but I can't do it the way they want.
    I know how you feel.
    You do?
    Sure.
    My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.
    Really?
    My only interest is flowers.
    Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.
    Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it?
    You're in Sheep Meadow!
    Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
    No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.
    Why do girls put rings on their toes?
    Why not?
    It's like putting a hat on your knee.
    Maybe I'll try that.
    You all right, ma'am?
    Oh, yeah. Fine.
    Just having two cups of coffee!
    Anyway, this has been great.
    Thanks for the coffee.
    Yeah, it's no trouble.
    Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.
    Are you...?
    Can I take a piece of this with me?
    Sure! Here, have a crumb.
    Thanks!
    Yeah.
    All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not.
    OK, Barry.
    And thank you so much again... for before.
    Oh, that? That was nothing.
    Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...
    This can't possibly work.
    He's all set to go.
    We may as well try it.
    OK, Dave, pull the chute.
    Sounds amazing.
    It was amazing!
    It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.
    Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!
    Giant, scary humans!
    What were they like?
    Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.
    They eat crazy giant things.
    They drive crazy.
    Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
    Some of them. But some of them don't.
    How'd you get back?
    Poodle.
    You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.
    You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.
    Well...
    Well?
    Well, I met someone.
    You did? Was she Bee-ish?
    A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
    No, no, no, not a wasp.
    Spider?
    I'm not attracted to spiders.
    I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face.
    So who is she?
    She's... human.
    No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.
    Her name's Vanessa.
    Oh, boy.
    She's so nice. And she's a florist!
    Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!
    We're not dating.
    You're flying outside The Hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!
    She saved my life! And she understands me.
    This is over!
    Eat this.
    This is not over! What was that?
    They call it a crumb.
    It was so stingin' stripey!
    And that's not what they eat.
    That's what falls off what they eat!
    You know what a Cinnabon is?
    No.
    It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...
    Sit down!
    ...really hot!
    Listen to me!
    We are not them! We're us.
    There's us and there's them!
    Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?
    There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!
    You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!
    Thinking bee.
    Thinking bee.
    Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
    There he is. He's in the pool.
    You know what your problem is, Barry?
    I gotta start thinking bee?
    How much longer will this go on?
    It's been three days! Why aren't you working?
    I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.
    What life? You have no life!
    You have no job. You're barely a bee!
    Would it kill you to make a little honey?
    Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.
    Martin, would you talk to him?
    Barry, I'm talking to you!
    You coming?
    Got everything?
    All set!
    Go ahead. I'll catch up.
    Don't be too long.
    Watch this!
    Vanessa!
    We're still here.
    I told you not to yell at him.
    He doesn't respond to yelling!
    Then why yell at me?
    Because you don't listen!
    I'm not listening to this.
    Sorry, I've gotta go.
    Where are you going?
    I'm meeting a friend.
    A girl? Is this why you can't decide?
    Bye.
    I just hope she's Bee-ish.
    They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?
    To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!
    Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.
    A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?
    No. All right, I've got one.
    How come you don't fly everywhere?
    It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.
    Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
    All right, your turn.
    TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!
    You don't have that?
    We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.
    Oh, my.
    Dumb bees!
    You must want to sting all those jerks.
    We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.
    So you have to watch your temper.
    Very carefully.
    You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust.
    Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?
    Yeah.
    What is wrong with you?!
    It's a bug.
    He's not bothering anybody.
    Get out of here, you creep!
    What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?
    Yeah, it was. How did you know?
    It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.
    You've really got that down to a science.
    I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
    I'll bet.
    What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?
    How did this get here? cute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select?
    Is he that actor?
    I never heard of him.
    Why is this here?
    For people. We eat it.
    You don't have enough food of your own?
    Well, yes.
    How do you get it?
    Bees make it.
    I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it!
    There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!
    It's organic.
    It's our-ganic!
    It's just honey, Barry.
    Just what?!
    Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!
    You've taken our homes, schools,hospitals! This is all we have!
    And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this.
    I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!
    Hey, Hector. You almost done?
    Almost.
    He is here. I sense it.
    Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.
    You're busted, box boy!
    I knew I heard something.
    So you can talk!
    I can talk. And now you'll start talking!
    Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier?
    I don't understand.
    I thought we were friends.
    The last thing we want to do is upset bees!
    You're too late! It's ours now!
    You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!
    You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio!
    Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where!
    Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!
    Crazy person!
    What horrible thing has happened here?
    These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now
    they're on the road to nowhere!
    Just keep still.

1pg9dw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/hockeyrefs/comments/1pg9dw0/advice_for_a_true_beginner/,Advice for a True Beginner,"I'm 30yo, live in the Midwest, good hockey country. I have been a baseball umpire for basically my entire life, started at 13 and quickly became very good, had a cup of coffee in the Minor League system. I have also been a football official since I was 17 and am getting to be even better at that than I am baseball. These days I work college ball for both, but my heart is more in football. I'm in a D3 conference full-time and recently applied to D2. But anyway.

Throughout the last 5-10 years, plenty of people have encouraged me to add basketball as a third sport in the winter. No interest. Others have encouraged me to add lacrosse. Even less interest. I've always said that if I was to add a third sport, it would be hockey. I've always loved hockey since I was a little kid.

Problem is, I can't skate. We grew up pretty poor and hockey was a little too beyond our means. I had a cousin who played hockey and we would go watch his games in high school, and my older brother has gotten into it with his son (my nephew) in the last ten years or so. So I've had some exposure to the game at the youth and high school levels, and am pretty confident I would enjoy it.

I recently graduated from law school and there's no time better than the present to make the plunge if I'm going to do it. But I want to do it right. That starts with being a sponge and learning as much as possible.

I've signed up for an adult ""Learn to Skate"" program. But that's it. It's a once-a-week hour-long program for about three months, and I'm hoping to go to an open skate at least once a week in addition to that. What advice do you have beyond that? Is there use in learning how to play hockey as well? What skates should I be looking at? What rule set should I start with? How long of learning skating will it take before I am ready for youth games?

I'm all ears. Thanks in advance!",4,1765081977.0,hockeyrefs,3,0.84,False
1pg9dsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Pasbeu43/comments/1pg9dsk/a_totally_euphoric_story_trans/,A Totally Euphoric Story (Trans),"Heya, thank you for reading this! Lately, I’ve been super into the idea of exploring moments of euphoria in the life of a recently transitioned transwoman. Whether the moment is as mundane as having their name shouted out on a coffee order, or as vain as admiring how amazing they look before a night out, I think it could be a super interesting framework to follow a storyline.

I think there’s so many directions the story could take. Whether the character is in college or exploring the world of work, I would love to brainstorm with you and experiment with some ideas! One particularly interesting way of looking at it is if our heroine does not originally consider themselves trans, but has transitioned for some ulterior motive. Watching them come to terms, and even enjoy, their new life could be fascinating! 

I’m really quite flexible with a lot of the story but I do have a very strong preference for realistic slice of life. Similarly I’m open to either play a single character or GM for you, and I love OOC to flesh out the story and plan what’s next. 

I’m a pretty experienced roleplayer in the GMT timezone and tend to start my stories with quite a bit of background discussion to really flesh out characters. This can range from how they look, to what their job is, to their birthday, to what country or time period this is set - I love getting into the details. Once the story begins I tend to write third person and a few paragraphs per response, but I’m very flexible as long as the story is good!

**Game Context:**  
Melbourne United (home) vs. S.E. Melbourne Phoenix (away) kicks off at 3:35 AM ET on Dec 7, 2025. The date discrepancy in the JSON (2025-12-07 vs. your note’s “2025-12-06 22”) suggests someone’s sleep-deprived and needs coffee—or a nap.

**Relevant Stats (What We *****Do***** Know):**

* Both teams are Melbourne-based, but they’ve apparently never met in a rivalry so fierce, it’s like the NBA’s Pelicans vs. Nets \[Doc 2\]… but with more kangaroos.
* No player props are listed in the provided data, so we can’t speculate on whether Phoenix’s star shooter will hit a three-pointer or if United’s point guard will commit more turnovers than a TSA agent at Christmas.

1pg987y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pg987y,Another Enagic Flex Fail: Team Rise Up's 2.8 Milly in Commissions,"TeamRiseUp members are bragging about doing **$2.8M in commissions** this year.  


**LET’S MATH, SHALL WE? (\*insert a sip of tea and a hot-sip-wince)**

YouTuber *thisismallory* estimated around **400 reps** on this team. TeamRiseUp’s own page claims **“500+ Health-Conscious Entrepreneurs.”** Hard to know how many of those are actual Enagic distributors vs. Coffee-Enema ButtholeBaristas or whatever other side schemes they’ve folded in — but let’s be generous and use the **lower number: 400**.

**$2.8M ÷ 400 = $7,000 salary per person per year.**  
 And because MLMs funnel money straight upward, (duh), the **median** income is almost certainly just a few *hundred* dollars **after** expenses.

To pay every rep even the **2025 U.S. poverty line ($15,650/yr)**, that $2.8M pool could only support **178 people**.

So either:

* They have **400–500 reps** and virtually **no one makes a living wage**, or  
* They have **178 reps** and they **lied about their team size**.  

Pick one. . . <3 HUN.

And how much of that $2.8M commish is just reps **buying their own machines**, their funnels, their quotas, and “earning” commissions off themselves? Be sure to subtract that. The Trifecta/Quad Strategy — where you’re buying your own crap so you can pretend you’re making money — isn’t entrepreneurship. It’s **self-cannibalizing revenue**, the MLM equivalent of eating your own arm to stay alive.

If Enagic were a movie, it would be **127 Hours. Or legit something with Gremlins.**

They mock “traditional jobs” for funneling money to the top 1%…  
while building a **mini-1%** of their own, where a handful get rich and hundreds work as unpaid marketers who can’t even scrape a living wage.

The difference?

**Real companies** are legally required to pay their workers a living wage.  

**Enagic isn’t.** And they’re *so very* proud of that.

Hope you’re all easing into the week with a clear head and a full cup of coffee. Precious metals have been putting on quite a show lately — gold flirting with new highs, silver waking up with real momentum, and the global outlook doing what it does best: keeping everyone on their toes. Between central banks stacking metal like it’s going out of style, supply tightening, and geopolitical “surprises” popping up like holiday lights, the long-term trend still feels strong and steady.

If you ask me, these are the moments where stacking smart — especially below spot — puts you ahead of the curve. Nothing wrong with staying prepared while the world sorts itself out.

Since one of us has limited mobility we decided to try the restaurant on the lower level, Prelude. The menu is limited, but we enjoyed cocktails and coffee and the whole group tried the buffet.  Even our celiac member had very nice choices.  Salads were very good, as was the salmon and beef.  The desserts were also appreciated, although the opera cake was a modified version of what we expected.

90g of ice

15g of coffee

150ml of hot water

And 3 drops of 20% saline water

I pour 150ml of hot water and pour coffee in, lightly stir, let it run until 3:30, then flip the switch.

All three beans are medium–light roast, roasted on 20/11/2025.
