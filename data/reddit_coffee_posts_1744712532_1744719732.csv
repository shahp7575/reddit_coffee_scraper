## What is Spot Relpax AI?

Spot Relpax AI is a **trading platform powered by artificial intelligence**. It claims to help users trade cryptocurrencies and other assets with minimal manual input. At its core, it's designed to analyze market trends, identify profitable opportunities, and execute trades automatically or with your approval.

While the concept isn’t new, what sets Spot Relpax AI apart is its **promise of real-time data processing**, faster reaction times, and a slick user interface that doesn’t require you to be a Wall Street genius to understand it. It’s a tool for both beginners looking for simplicity and seasoned traders wanting to automate their strategies.

## Who Created Spot Relpax AI?

Spot Relpax AI doesn’t have a well-known founder like Elon or Vitalik behind it. The team appears to be a group of **fintech developers and data scientists**, many of whom previously worked on similar platforms like Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge.

While I wish they were more transparent about the team’s credentials, this anonymity isn’t too unusual in the world of trading software. What matters more is how well the platform performs and how it handles user funds and data security—which, fortunately, it seems to do fairly well.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Spot Relpax AI Today](https://tinyurl.com/58ycs4z4)
## How Does Spot Relpax AI Work?

Spot Relpax AI uses **machine learning algorithms** to monitor and analyze financial markets 24/7. It pulls data from multiple exchanges and news sources, then uses that intel to predict short-term price movements.

Here’s what goes on behind the scenes:

- **Data Collection**: Pulls live market data from major exchanges.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies trends and trading signals.
- **Trade Execution**: Places trades based on predefined rules or AI signals, either automatically or with user confirmation.
- **Custom Settings**: Lets users adjust risk levels, trading pairs, and more.

The goal is to reduce the emotional guesswork and give users a smarter, faster way to trade. It doesn’t guarantee profits (no platform can), but it does aim to improve your odds.

## Spot Relpax AI Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real—no platform is perfect. Here’s what I found:

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Easy to use**, even for beginners

- ✅ **Supports multiple asset types** (crypto, stocks, forex)
- ✅ Low entry barrier with a $250 minimum deposit

## What is Omanetrix Trade?

Omanetrix Trade is an **automated trading platform** designed to simplify the process of investing in cryptocurrencies and other financial markets. Rather than manually reading charts and trying to time the market, Omanetrix uses **AI-driven algorithms** to execute trades on your behalf. 

It’s part of a new wave of platforms aiming to make trading more accessible to everyday people. Think of it like having a robo-advisor, except this one’s focused on short-term trades using high-volatility assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even traditional forex pairs.

## Who Created Omanetrix Trade?

Details about the exact team behind Omanetrix Trade are a bit murky—something that’s fairly common with platforms in this space. While there’s no public founder like Brian Armstrong with Coinbase, the platform claims to be built by a group of **financial analysts, software engineers, and crypto enthusiasts** with experience in AI and high-frequency trading.

This anonymity might raise eyebrows, but it’s actually par for the course with many algorithm-based trading platforms. Still, I'd prefer a bit more transparency here.

That said, always approach trading with caution. Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose, and definitely do your own research.

1jzqb3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalintelligence/comments/1jzqb3u/people_come_and_go/,People come and go ...,"Life, to me, often feels like drifting through outer space. Not the cold vacuum we read about in science books, but a symbolic space—vast, infinite, filled with endless possibility. Each star is a moment I might live. Each galaxy, a version of myself I might become.

And somewhere in that quiet infinity, there’s a diner. A Denny’s in outer space. Maybe an IHOP. It doesn’t matter the name—it matters that it exists outside of time. A liminal space where souls pause for coffee, for pancakes, for presence.

That’s how I see relationships.

We’re all just drifters, voyaging solo through this infinite cosmic mystery. And sometimes, two paths intersect. Two travelers—nothing in common but the booth they share—choose, even if only for a moment, to sit down together.

They laugh.
They argue.
They fall in love.
They ache.
They forgive.
They share stories from their galaxies, their scars, their dreams.

In the grand scheme of things, it’s seconds.
But in that moment, it feels like forever.

And when the check comes—when it's time to go—they leave.
Not always together.
But always changed.

Because the only real constant in this whole celestial drift is the relationship I have with myself.
And the presence of God within me.
Everything else is a beautiful, temporary collision.
A sacred pause.

The tail end of the ’90s was the era of Clinton sex scandals and Jerry Springer and the launch of a neat new drug called Viagra, a period when sex saturated mainstream culture. In the Spears profile, the interviewer, Steven Daly, alternates between lust—the logo on her Baby Phat T‐shirt, he notes, is “distended by her ample chest”—and detached observation that the sexuality of teen idols is just a “carefully baited” trap to sell records to suckers. Being a teen myself, I found it hard to discern the irony. What was obvious to my friends and to me was that power, for women, was sexual in nature. There was no other kind, or none worth having. I attended an all-girls school run by stern second-wave feminists, who told us that we could succeed in any field or industry we chose. But that messaging was obliterated by the entertainment we absorbed all day long, which had been thoroughly shaped by the one defining art form of the late 20th century: porn.

But that messaging was obliterated by the entertainment we absorbed all day long, which had been thoroughly shaped by the one defining art form of the late 20th century: porn.


By this point in history, pornography, as Frank Rich argued in a New York Times Magazine story in 2001, was American culture, even if no one wanted to admit it. Porn was a multibillion-dollar industry in the United States—worth more money, Rich suggested, than consumers in the U.S. spent on movie tickets in a year, and purportedly “a bigger business than professional football, basketball and baseball put together.” It was a cultural product few people bragged about consuming, but it was infiltrating our collective imagination nevertheless, in ways no one could fully assess at the time. And things were just getting started. Porn helped define the structure and mores of the internet. It dominated popular music, as the biggest hip-hop stars of the era released hard-core films and the teenage stars of my generation redefined themselves for adulthood with fetish-tweaking music videos. In 2003, Snoop Dogg arrived at the MTV Video Music Awards with two women wearing dog collars attached to leashes that he held in each hand, to minimal protest. In 2004, the esteemed fashion photographer Terry Richardson released a coffee-table book that predominantly featured pictures of his own erect penis, and the models he’d cajoled into posing with it.

This period of porno chic arrived with an asterisk that insisted it was all a game, a postmodern, sex-positive appropriation of porn’s tropes and aesthetics. But for women, particularly those of us just entering adulthood, the rules of that game were clear: We were the ultimate Millennial commodity, our bodies cheerfully co-opted and replicated as media content within the public domain. If we complained, we were vilified as prudes or scolds. This kind of sexualization was “empowering,” everyone kept insisting. But the form of power we were being allotted wasn’t the sort you accrue over a lifetime, in the manner of education or money or professional experience. It was all about youth, attention, and a willingness to be in on the joke, even when we were the punch line.

Hoping to get some advice on a work situation I'm currently facing here in Metro Manila. I'm a Real Time Analyst and recently accepted a new job offer, but I've been having serious second thoughts for over a month now.

My Previous Job:

Workload: Honestly, it was quite heavy. Lots of tasks and pressure.
Incentives: Had one main incentive scheme. The criteria were tough, but I was confident I could meet them.
The Perks (Big Ones): Free breakfast & lunch daily, free coffee from a vendo machine (multiple flavors!), free wifi, free locker.
Commute: Relatively easy – just 2 rides (jeep/bus/etc.) taking around 50 minutes from my home.
My Current (New) Job:

Workload: Significantly lighter, less stressful tasks day-to-day.
Incentives: Has the same incentive as the old job, plus additional quarterly ones.
The Downsides: No free food or coffee (feeling the pinch on my budget!).
Commute: This is the killer. It's now almost 2 hours each way, involving 3 different rides. I often end up using Grab/ride-hailing just to get to work on time, then commute normally going home. It's draining and expensive.
The Dilemma:

I've been contemplating trying to go back to my previous company for more than a month. While the workload at the new job is lighter, the loss of perks (especially free meals) and the absolutely brutal commute are making me question my decision. At my old job, despite the heavier tasks, I saved a lot more money (food, transpo) and time.

I'm torn between the easier workload here and the better overall quality of life (commute, savings) at the old place.",1,1744719079.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

1jzq6qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1jzq6qo/musings_success_stories/,Musings - success stories,"Musings –Stories of Success -Modern Avatar

How many times we read (more hear) heartrending  and motivational stories from business leaders and celebrities about their journey to success, the trial and turbulations and the immense challenges that they had to overcome to reach the current position. I have noticed that most of these stories are peppered with some “Modern-Day Idioms or Phrases” which try to define the beginning or the lowest point of that journey. A start from the Nadir and then reaching the Zenith seems to be main theme on which the stories are centered around, and they are really fascinating and inspiring to read and hear. 

 

 I intentionally call these phrases “Modern” as these are nothing like the ancient wisdom or tales that our ancestors used to tell us and nor are they so dated that due to efflux of time we must take them as Gospel.  These are more of a modern version of dramatizing and putting out a story which appeals to people. 

 

Some of the most often used ones in the modern lingo are:

 

·      Came with Hundred / thousand rupees in Pocket.

·      Slept on Railway station.

·      Shared room with 5 friends.

·      Survived on Vadapav.

·      Business plan was written on handkerchief or finalized in a Coffee shop.

·      We started the company with 2 lacs capital.

·      Our first office was a garage.  

 

Interestingly these phrases are also associated with a certain type of individuals. The ones relating to survival ones are used most often by people in the media world (celluloid)  while the ones on financial /business  are as the name suggest by Businessmen.

 

While I am not a doubting Thomas or a pessimist, but I often wonder, if the back stories that are usually associated with these phrases are completely true. How many of them really succeeded basis those facts and was there an element of economizing of truth.  Also do they tell the whole story, and should we be inspired and motivated and move forward on the same path?  

 

Happy and successful endings littered with challenges and the protagonist willpower to overcome them all and succeed are good and important for building positive energy but many times they lead to misplaced notions about modern day challenges and ground realties.  

 

I would acknowledge that a healthy percentage (15-20%) of these “phrases” would be meeting all the points and are truly inspiring, but in this modern age of social media and instant broadcasting there is also a great deal of competition to share one’s experiences which brings not only recognition and appreciation but also a horde of followers.

 

Also, majority or rather all these people have created immense wealth and goodwill over a period of them and the fact that they are being followed and quoted is testament to the fact that people are inspired by them.  The end part of the journey is clear for all of them “Success “. **I am focusing on the starting point and whether that is the baseline at which everybody started**.

 

Before the Unicorn founders and other successful people come heavily down on me and take umbrage, let me state in my defense that I am not undermining the struggle and the success of any of them. I am inspired and proud of what all of them have achieved. I am just reflecting on the in-between noise and that some of these journeys may not be capturing the facts to a full extent. 

 

Since these are my musings and not a fact-finding exercise, rather than doing a diligence and focusing on what these stories tell, I would try to reflect on what these stories “ **may not or do-not tell.**

 

**Business Related Ones**



·      “Business plan written on handkerchief or in Coffee shop”

·      “We started the company with 2 lacs capital “

·      “First office was a garage” 

 

I am not attempting to delve into the context of each one but generally as part of messaging they do not tell that: 

 

·      The ideation of business idea had been going on for a reasonably long time – “There was no Eureka Moment”.

·      A lot of rough feasibility calculations and what if scenarios had been prepared before the idea was launched. 

·      Majority of time they were working in another company and were reasonably well placed. 

·      The coffee meeting was part of a series of meetings between the founders or it may have been a first meeting, and the actual business plan got finalized over series of meetings and /or in more formal settings.

·      The Paper napkins in the coffee shops are not very conducive to scribbling notes. 

·      Majority of Companies are incorporated with limited capital and the larger funding structure comes in much later. There is nothing unusual about Rs 1-2 lacs starting capital of a company.

·      The initial capital of Rs 1 -2 lacs is the statutory requirement and larger capital infusions are made in form of loans and convertible structures. 

·      The basic requirement of savings for a reasonable living have been taken care off – spouse settled and earning, family wealth or business, ESOPs and savings from Current jobs etc. 

·      The Garage was most possibly part of a Bungalow of one of the founders (In modern times who can afford a “garage anyways” and that too which can be used as an Office. Must be garage for parking 2-3 Cars)

 

**Media -Stardom Related Ones** 

 

·      “Came with hundred / thousand rupees in Pocket”

·      “Slept on Railway station”

·      “Shared room with 5 friends”

·      “Survived on Vadapav”

 

Again, the messaging and the tone of all these stories is the same. The invidual has come this far on their own strength and despite all the hardships and circumstances.   

I respect all of that, but in keeping with the theme of this article, I will focus on what these stories are generally not telling:

 

·      While thousand rupees were in pocket, a big fat balance was there in a personal or other easily tapable bank accounts.

·       The train was probably missed due to an extended evening out with friends.  and it was approaching dawn, so no point in booking hotel for 3-4 hours.

(I wonder if they were ever hauled up by railway police -like other mere mortals) 

·       Number of such nights which were spent on bus tops and railways stations in a month or a year. 

·       The room sharing part I can understand as rentals in Metro cities can be quite a drain, but I am curious to know which are those housing societies which allowed 5-6 to stay in one room. 

·       Favorite is the Vada Pav One - Was that the only meal of the day or part of the evening snack. 

o   Did they build up those bulging biceps and endless energy from the Humble Vadpav. No wonder that Vada Pav has become such a hit amongst the masses.

## What is UPSILON NEXIFY?

UPSILON NEXIFY is an **automated trading platform** that uses advanced algorithms to analyze financial markets and help users make better trades. It’s designed for people who want to start trading but don’t necessarily have the time or skills to do all the heavy lifting themselves.

The platform supports multiple asset classes like **cryptocurrencies**, **forex**, **stocks**, and **commodities**. It offers both manual and automated trading options, which means you can either set your own strategy or let the system handle trades based on real-time market analysis.

I’d compare it to platforms like **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge**—but with a slightly more modern interface and smoother UX. Think of it as your smart trading assistant that doesn’t sleep.

## Who Created UPSILON NEXIFY?

The creators of UPSILON NEXIFY are a team of **fintech developers and data scientists** who’ve remained mostly under the radar. That’s not super uncommon in the automated trading world. While there’s no single public figure associated with the platform, the company claims to have years of experience in algorithmic trading and financial modeling.

That said, I always recommend approaching anonymous teams with a bit of caution. While the platform itself functions well, some transparency around leadership would definitely boost trust.

UPSILON NEXIFY’s real-time market scanner is probably its best feature. It processes **massive amounts of data** in seconds to identify trends and opportunities. This is what powers the automated trading engine.

It’s kinda like having a team of Wall Street analysts in your pocket… but without the coffee addiction.

### User-Friendly Interface

The UI is clean, modern, and intuitive. Even if you’ve never traded before, you’ll find it easy to navigate. Charts update in real-time, and the dashboard gives you a clear overview of your portfolio and current trades.

This is a big win, especially when compared to some clunky platforms I’ve tried in the past.

No app = slight bummer. But the browser version works well on mobile. I was able to monitor and even execute trades from my phone while waiting in line for coffee.

For a platform that’s still gaining traction, that’s impressive.

Also, while there are some anonymous elements (like the dev team), that’s not unusual in this space. Just be smart and do your own research.

Their support team is **surprisingly responsive**. I tested the live chat and got a reply within 2 minutes. You can also reach them by email, and there’s a help center with FAQs and tutorials.

Real World Location: The Starfield Library in Seoul, Korea, stands in for the fictional one in the story. It's a really cool library and gathering space that I would absolutely see these characters enjoying.

Here is Part 4 of Our Reality, which is written from Natsuki's perspective. The members of the Literature Club explore the tower's underground library, and Natsuki visits a nearby bookstore looking for some new manga to read. She meets a fellow manga fan, but does she handle the conversation well?

[Custom Image - Our Library](https://i.imgur.com/IfbRtC8.png)

**Part 4: Our Library (Natsuki)**

After Sayori had returned to the 60^(th) floor after stopping downstairs to get her credit card, the members of the Literature Club stepped into the express elevator that would take them to the underground levels of the tower. It was now around lunchtime and the transportation systems of Legacy Tower were busy with office workers and residents heading to lunch. Monika, Sayori, Yuri, Natsuki, and Sayuri all crowded into an elevator with several other people and descended towards floor B2. None of the other occupants of the elevator car, most of whom had their eyes fixed on their phones, gave the members of the Literature Club a second glance despite their unusual hair and eye colors.

“Everybody excited to check out the library?” Natsuki asked.

“Definitely,” Monika agreed, “I’m hoping that in addition to an excellent collection of books, the library will also be a great place to relax.”

“I did some research on my phone to ascertain more information about this library,” Yuri explained, “Based on what I read, it is at the center of the underground mall that this building is built above, has a well-regarded collection of literature, and is a popular location for visitors to take photographs.”

Natsuki smiled eagerly. *If I’m lucky they’ll have a decent manga section. But I shouldn’t get my hopes up.*

“In addition, if we wish to purchase books it appears that there is a bookstore a few steps away from the library,” Yuri continued.

“That sounds great,” Sayuri said with a smile, “Thank you for looking that up, Yuri.”

“Do you think the library would be a good place for club meetings?” Sayori suggested, “Now that we don’t have the classroom anymore, we need to find a new place to get together.”

“That’s a good thought, Sayori,” Monika replied, “We’ll have to see if there are any good spots for us to hold meetings.”

The elevator chimed and announced that it had arrived on floor B2, and the group stepped out and into the underground mall. The mall was bustling with activity and the conversations of shoppers reverberated off the polished floors. Numerous shops and restaurants lined the corridors stretching off in multiple directions.

“The library is this way,” Yuri said, gesturing to the left at a sign.

The group walked down the corridor to the library. As they entered the large, two-story open space, the members of the Literature Club audibly gasped in unison.

“Oh. My. Goodness,” Sayori said quietly.

The library featured a transparent ceiling with a view up to the tower above, four large floor-to-ceiling book stacks, one in each corner, and a large open area in the center which for the season featured a tall Christmas tree covered in warm-toned lights. From the ceiling hung numerous stars with lighting that matched the tree, and soft jazz renditions of popular Christmas songs played through the sound system. At this hour the library was filled with students studying and office workers having a coffee and reading during their lunch breaks.

“I’ve never seen anything like this. I never imagined…,” Monika trailed off as she looked around the space, a tear of happiness slowly forming in one of her emerald-colored eyes and rolling down her cheek, “I never thought I’d get to see a place like this.”

Yuri nodded her agreement. “While I knew this library to be impressive from what I had read about it, now having experienced it for myself I can say it exceeds my expectations.”

“I love all the decorations,” Sayuri added, “This is wonderful.”

“Now if they have a good manga section, that will just be the icing on the cake,” Natsuki said as she looked toward the stacks of books.

“Well, let’s check it out,” Monika said, “Judging by the size of the stacks they should have a good variety.”

The group split up, and Natsuki walked to a public access computer that served as a directory for the library. She clicked on the library map icon, and a listing of the locations of various genres of literature appeared on the screen in alphabetical order.

*Okay…let’s see here. M. Music, no but Monika might like that, Mystery, no, but Yuri might enjoy that. No manga? Boo.*

Natsuki sighed in frustration and prepared to walk away when a librarian approached her.

“Can I help you find something?”

“Oh, hi. My name’s Natsuki, it’s nice to meet you,” Natsuki said, surprised at first but quickly regaining her composure, “I was looking for…um…manga books.”

“Yes, we do have a section where you can find them,” the librarian confirmed, tapping a few keys on the computer’s keyboard, “They’re under the ‘comic books and manga’ category over here.”

The librarian pointed Natsuki to the stack that contained the comic books section. Natsuki thanked her and turned to walk to the indicated area of the library.

*Comic books and manga,* Natsuki thought with frustration, *I should have known. I’m sure it’s going to just be a bunch of silly superhero whatever*.

Her frown was quickly erased when she saw the shelves, which contained both American comics and many rows of manga books. *This makes my manga collection look tiny!*

She excitedly looked over the shelves. *So many titles here I’ve never heard of. This is going to be great! Maybe I can even find something that Yuri, MC, and I can all read together. But now the big test. Do they have Parfait Girls?*

She browsed the titles, starting with the “popular new releases” section which were organized alphabetically.

*If they have it, it will be here. Let’s see. ‘L’, ‘M,’ ‘N’, ‘O,’ ‘P...’They don’t seem to have it. That’s a bummer. But these are all in English…maybe they don’t have ‘Parfait Girls’ because it’s only in Japanese. I’ll try the bookstore.*

Leaving the library, Natsuki walked down the corridor to the bookstore, looking at the shop windows as she walked by them. She passed by a popular Korean cosmetics store and several clothing stores which had the latest fashions displayed on mannequins in their windows.

*Some really nice outfits in these clothing stores. I wonder if they’d look good on me.*

She stepped into the bookstore and looked around, visibly impressed by the number of volumes on display. The bookstore’s shelves were finished with dark wood paneling and were organized by genre. Tables at the front of the store contained the latest releases and digital e-reader tablets. Behind the counter stood a young man about her age who was finishing a transaction for another customer. He was tall, had black hair and blue eyes and wore a shirt with the bookstore’s logo on it.

*Should I ask him for help?* Natsuki wondered. *No, he’d probably think I was some kind of weirdo. I’ll find the manga myself.*

She wandered the shelves for several minutes, passing by several genres of books including cookbooks and travel guides. As she strolled through the thriller novel section, she was startled by a voice behind her.

“Can I help you find anything?”

Natsuki turned around in surprise to see the young man from the counter. She looked at his nametag, which provided both his first name and his title of manager.

“Um…hi,” she began cautiously, “I'm Natsuki. Nice to meet you. So you’re the manager here? Is this your bookstore?”

The young man smiled. “Sort of. It belongs to my family, but I run the place day to day. Is there anything in particular you’re looking for?”

Natsuki paused and looked away before answering quietly. “Manga,” she muttered with embarrassment.

“Oh, cool,” the bookstore manager replied, seemingly unfazed, “We just got in a bunch of new volumes. I’ve been trying to bring in more younger customers by adding some new selections like expanding our manga section. Let me show you what we’ve got.”

The bookstore manager led Natsuki to a shelf which contained numerous manga volumes.

“So are you a big fan of manga?” he asked, “Any favorites?”

Natsuki struggled internally before deciding on a response. *I can at least find out if they have Parfait Girls.*

“Yes, I enjoy manga. My favorite is a series called ‘Parfait Girls.’ Do you have it?”

The bookstore manager thought for a moment. “The name doesn’t ring a bell. We carry most of the popular manga series that have been translated into English.”

Natsuki shook her head. “I’m not sure if it has an English version.”

The bookstore manager nodded. “We don’t carry a ton of manga in Japanese, but we can get it. I can look it up on the computer for you. Can you read Japanese?”

Natsuki nodded. “Fluent…I grew up in Osaka.”

“That’s really cool,” the bookstore manager said with admiration, “I’ve tried to learn but it’s tough. I can look up ‘Parfait Girls’ on the computer when you check out, but while we’re here are there any particular genres you like? I can suggest a few series for you to check out.”

Natsuki looked at him suspiciously. *Is he genuinely being helpful, or is he just going to end up teasing me about what I enjoy like so many others have? Maybe I’ll start by asking him for something that MC and I can read together.*

“Sure. I often read with a friend. He usually thinks ‘Parfait Girls’ is too girly and tells me he likes manga with more action. I don’t want something that’s just one long fight though. Any suggestions?”

“I think I can come up with something.” The bookstore manager thought for a moment before stepping over to the shelf and pulling out a book. He handed it to Natsuki.

“‘My Superhero School,’” she read aloud as she looked it over.

“It’s very popular right now,” the bookstore manager explained, “It’s about a high school that trains young people with supernatural abilities to be heroes. Lots of action, but it also has high school slice of life storylines as well.

*That definitely sounds like something that MC and I could read together,* Natsuki thought happily, *But anyone can recommend a popular manga. Let’s see what else he comes up with.*

“Here’s another one that’s a bit more obscure,” the bookstore manager continued, handing her another book, ‘Innocent Bullet: The False World.’

The cover of the volume showed three young women and a young man. They wore school uniforms not dissimilar to her own, but over them they wore tactical gear. But what caught Natsuki’s eye the most was the designs of two of the characters.

*One of them could be Sayori’s twin if you add a red hair bow. And the guy looks like he could be MC’s brother.* She stifled a laugh and felt her defensive mood starting to dissipate.

“Sorry, I’m not laughing at your recommendation. It’s just that two of these characters look just like manga versions of two of my best friends including the guy I like to read with. What’s the story of this series?”

The bookstore manager smiled. “No offense taken. It’s a story of a group of high school students who are also part of a special forces unit fighting monsters in Japan. It’s got a lot of action, but it also has some romance elements. I think it would be something that would fit what you're looking for.”

*Not bad*, Natsuki thought*, MC would definitely go for this, particularly since the male lead looks like him. And if there’s some romance in there too, I think I could enjoy it as well.*

The bookstore owner continued to explain both series for several minutes until Natsuki was satisfied that they would be enjoyable.

“Thanks, I appreciate the recommendations,” Natsuki picked up a few volumes of both series and followed the bookstore manager to the checkout counter.

The bookstore manager scanned Natsuki’s books and tapped a few keys on his computer.

“I’m not coming up with anything for ‘Parfait Girls’ unfortunately,” he explained apologetically, “Could it be under another name in Japan?”

Natsuki looked disappointed as an unpleasant thought came to her mind.

*Is it something that only existed in the simulation? Darn. It may not even exist here.*

The bookstore manager saw the disappointment on her face. “Sorry about that. I think you’ll enjoy these though, and if you want a more traditional slice of life story I’m sure we can find something for you.”

He put the books in a bag as Natsuki paid for them with her credit card.

“Thanks. I appreciate the recommendations.”

“Any time,” he replied, “You made it easy to make good recommendations. You clearly know what you like in manga.”

Natsuki grinned. “I like to think I’m pretty knowledgeable. I’ve even thought about writing my own at some point or collaborating with friends to write one. I’m just glad I was able to find a good source for books. I just moved into this building, and I was afraid it might be hard to find them here.”

“I’m glad I could help you in your search for some good reads,” the bookstore manager said, returning her grin, “What do you think you would write about?”

Natsuki waved her hand. “It’s still just an idea in my head.”

The bookstore manager nodded. “Well, best of luck with that. It was great to meet you and talk manga for a bit…I had hoped you were a fan when I saw you walk into the store. To be honest you kind of look like you just stepped out of a manga.”

Natsuki frowned, her defensiveness returning. “What’s that supposed to mean?”

The bookstore manager held up a hand. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you. I just meant that I think your style is really neat. Your hair and outfit almost make you look like a manga character.”

*If only you knew how close to the truth that is*, Natsuki thought, calming down.

“Oh. Umm…no offense taken. I don’t always dress like this, but yes, my style is inspired a bit by some of my favorite manga characters.”

“That’s cool,” he replied, “Well, if you ever want to talk manga more, it would be great to meet up sometime and-.”

Natsuki cut him off. “I like talking about manga, but it’s not like I’m looking for a date or anything.”

The bookstore manager looked apologetic. “I’m sorry. I should have clarified…I was going to say that there’s a group of us that meet up every Friday after work and discuss manga that we’ve been reading or writing.”

*Oops. Am I being too defensive?* “So sort of like a manga club?” Natsuki asked.

The bookstore manager nodded. “Yeah…as I’m sure you know, a lot of manga and anime series center around high school clubs, and so a group of us thought it would be fun to create something similar and meet here at the bookstore on Friday evenings after work to relax and share our hobby.”

Natsuki smiled. “Yeah, I know what you mean. I was part of a literature club at my high school in Osaka.”

“Oh, then it would definitely be great to have you as part of our group,” the bookstore manager said, “You seem like a really cool person and…”

He trailed off, clearly wanting to say more. Natsuki raised an eyebrow expectantly.

“I know you said you’re not looking for a date,” he continued nervously, “But if I’m honest I think you’re cute and it would be great to grab coffee or tea sometime.”

Natsuki’s face twisted into a scowl. *Really? Cute? Of all the things he could say, that’s what he went for? I probably would have said yes to him had he not done that.*

“I’m not cute,” Natsuki said emphatically, not providing a response to the coffee invitation as she picked up the bag of books and walked out of the bookstore without saying another word.

She walked back to the library to meet up with her friends, her expression still unhappy.

*Cute. Why do people always call me that?*

Sayori, Yuri, Monika, and Sayuri all sat around one of the library’s tables looking content and focused on the books in their hands.

Sayori frowned as she saw Natsuki approach in her peripheral vision. “Are you okay? Did you find any good shops?”

Natsuki shook her head. “Not only did the bookstore not carry ‘Parfait Girls’, but the store manager tried to ask me out for coffee and called me cute.”

Sayori looked confused. “That’s too bad about the manga, but the second part doesn’t sound so bad. Was he rude or something?”

Natsuki shook her head again. “No, he actually seems to be a big fan of manga, and I enjoyed talking to him. He even invited me to join his manga club.”

Sayori raised an eyebrow. “So…what’s the problem? Other than the fact that you can’t join the manga club because you’d never turn your back on the Literature Club.”

“He called me cute,” Natsuki reiterated, folding her arms across her chest, “You know I hate that. It made it feel like he was looking down on me.”

Sayori and Yuri exchanged a confused glance.

“While I was not present for this interaction, I believe you may have misinterpreted it,” Yuri suggested thoughtfully, “You are a physically attractive young woman who shares his interest in manga, and by asking you to join him for coffee he is clearly indicating that he finds you interesting. In this case it would appear that by calling you cute he was trying to complement you, though it appears that he may have been a bit awkward in doing so.”

Sayori nodded her head in agreement. “Yeah, that. If he was a nice guy and you were having a good conversation, why would he insult you?”

“He…wouldn’t,” Natsuki said slowly, struggling internally, “But it’s just…I…no. I just can’t help but react negatively when someone calls me cute. You all know my story and how before I joined the Literature Club I never felt like I belonged anywhere. I always got teased about my writing and drawing and when classmates would make fun of me, they’d always say I was too into cute things as if it made me childish.”

“I didn’t know that,” Sayuri chimed in, putting her book down, “I can see why that would bring up some unpleasant memories for you. It’s great that you found the Literature Club though.”

“Yeah,” Sayori concurred, “The Literature Club has really been a social home for all of us. We’ve all learned from and helped each other in so many ways.”

Monika smiled. “That was my goal when I started the club…to have a place for friendship and literature. I never imagined the places it would take us.”

“Me either,” Natsuki agreed, “If you told me that we’d end up…moving…to a place like this I’d never have believed it. You guys may be right about that guy. Maybe I’ll chat with him again the next time I stop by the bookstore. But for now, I think I’ll join you guys for some reading time.”

*As much as I don’t want to admit it, they may right. I probably was too harsh back there. But why would he ask out someone like me? It doesn’t matter. It’s not like I wanted to get to know him better anyway. But do I really believe that?*

“Pull up a chair and join in,” Monika said, gesturing to an empty seat, “What did you pick up at the bookstore?”

“A few books that I thought MC and I could share…and of course anyone else who wanted to join us for manga time. They’ve got action which will make MC happy, and slice of life and romance elements for those of us who think that there’s more to a good story than just a series of explosions.”

Sayori giggled. “That reminds me, I should send him a text and tell him to join us when he’s done with the FXI guys.”

She pulled out her phone and typed a quick message to the group text. *Hey MC we’re down in the library if you want to join us. Natsuki found some manga with explosions for you.*

MC quickly typed back. *Cool! Tell her thanks for me and that I’m looking forward to reading them during our next manga time. I’m still getting everything set up here but I’ll let you know when I’m done.*

Natsuki shook her head. “MC being responsible…never would have expected that from him when you first dragged him to the club.”

“You know we’re all going to have to do that before too long,” Monika reminded the group, “We’ll need to figure out what we’re going to do with our lives now.”

“Yeah, I know,” Sayori said with a hint of wistfulness in her voice, “But can we not think about that until after the holidays?”

“I’m with Sayori on this one,” Sayuri agreed, “Let’s enjoy our new lives here for now and figure out what we want to do with them as we get more familiar with this place.”

Monika nodded. “Sounds like a plan. With that in mind, let’s enjoy this great library and have some club reading time for the next few hours, and then go grab some dinner together to celebrate our first night here.”

Natsuki smiled as she looked around the table at her friends. *What would I do without this group?*

Her reverie was interrupted by Yuri, who slid a book across the table to her.

“What’s this?” Natsuki asked, looking at the title, “Is this a manga? ‘A Certain Magical Railgun?’”

Yuri shook her head. “This is a light novel. While it has some similarities to manga including illustrations, it primarily tells its story through text rather than images. I came across it while looking for fantasy books, and I felt it would be both a good midpoint between manga and traditional literature as well as a story about individuals with magical powers that you and I could both enjoy.”

“That sounds great,” Natsuki said appreciatively, “Thanks for finding that.”

“It was fortunate that the library has multiple copies as well so we can both read it at the same time,” Yuri continued, “I look forward to reading it and discussing it with you.

As the title suggests I have shortlisted a couple of SASE vendors for our company and will go through why.

Our requirements are the following:

Coffee shop scenario where we protect remote users wherever they are and connect to private resources whether SaaS or Public Cloud. We are serverless meaning no servers or dependancy on any of our physical sites, everything needed is in public cloud or SaaS. 800+ users, multi-OS environment, predominately EU based.

Only 5-6 managed sites with the idea would be eventually SD-WAN (we have no MPLS just DIA with Tier 1 ISPs) if not implemented already (We have some sites for Fortigate SD-WAN), for now the simple use case is protecting our user's managed devices and eventually moving to IoT and what not. So you could say our priority is SSE with scope to introduce SD-WAN.

FortiSASE - We have some FortiGates and introducing more so it seemed the natural next step to see if we can adopt it but had loads of issues with 3rd party integrations and performance.  
Netskope - Great product like CASB & DLP but quite expensive  
Cato - Very simple to understand and use, best UI experience and can see easiest to deploy but the whole 3-5 minute deployments to all POPs kind of annoys me.  
Zscaler - Great product very feature rich with quick policy deployments but very enterprise focuses and clunky dashboard with multiple panes of glass resulting in steeper learning curve (Of course the new experience centre is yet to be seen)

I have narrowed it down to CATO & ZScaler based on our needs but wanted to user's opinions on anyone that has done a POV or deployed it. Would greatly appreciate if anyone can let me know of anything they have experienced/kinks seen and why they went for either vendor.

I’m proud of everything I achieved—but the way it ended just confirmed I was making the right decision. I love the company, but not the local leadership.

Shortly after I resigned, my boomer manager gave the team one day’s notice that end-of-quarter drinks would also be my farewell. No real effort—just tacked on to an event (that I had organized) It was an afterthought. Stark contrast to all the effort I've put in for others! 

He’d been in town for three weeks during my notice period, never said hey let's go for coffee or I'll take you out for lunch. Then, from the airport before heading overseas, he emailed senior leaders (including me) asking them to take me to lunch on a date he picked—without even checking if that time was available for me. It felt careless and performative. It was a strategic move to conveniently think of that as he's boarding a flight out of the country. Even ChatGPT said it was rude when I read it out. You know it’s bad when the robot agrees.

This same manager spent the past year nitpicking me—saying I “come across as anxious” and “say um too much.” It wasn’t feedback—it was micromanaging. He literally had nothing he could use about my performance so he went personal. He kept saying he was surprised I was leaving. Honestly? I wasn’t. I never challenged him or disagreed (even if I did internally!) went above and beyond, worked long hours, did what I was asked at speed. I've got such a good relationship with our team and always go out of my way to go the extra mile. I'd absolutely love to give him feedback on what I think of the affair he's been having for the past 6+ years with a woman who lives in another state that he travels to fortnightly on company time and money. Yet has no business or customer meetings scheduled. 

He’s known for ghosting people when they resign—blocking them in person, never saying goodbye. I knew he wouldn’t reach out as he's on leave, so I chose to be the bigger person. I messaged him a thank you, and he called me. The call lasted less than two minutes. If I hadn’t texted, I’m sure I never would’ve heard from him again. My previous managers would get me birthday and Christmas gifts and take me out for lunch, celebrate my work anniversaries. I got nothing over the years from him. He doesn't know when my birthday is and never bothered to say merry Christmas and thank you for your hard work this year. 

It’s weird—but it’s over. And I’m finally moving on 🙏🥳

I start a new role soon where my (gen x!!) manager offered me the top of the salary range plus more, without me asking. I’m getting a 25% increase and a bonus (my first ever). I was meant to be in the office 3 days a week—but he told me I can mostly work remotely if I prefer. He allows me to speak and doesn't talk over me to make me feel small. He listens to my ideas and shares the same values. I feel like it's going to be a great match. 

I feel like myself again. I’m excited for what’s next—and finally feeling valued. I thought I'd share my story for anyone stuck in this situation. It took me two years of looking and I've been very selective but I found something. ",10,1744718708.0,ExecutiveAssistants,1,1.0,False

1jzq1lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1jzq1lg/constant_fatigue_how_to_increase_my_energy/,Constant fatigue. How to increase my energy?,"Hi,

I’ve been struggling with a strange, persistent fatigue for the past 4 years, and I’m hoping someone here might relate or have insights.

It all started after my weight loss journey. I went from 89kg to 74kg (I’m 178cm tall), and soon after, I began feeling constantly low on energy—not exactly sleepy, just drained and fatigued. This feeling isn’t every single day, but I’d say it hits me at least 5 times a week.

I’ve done comprehensive blood tests, including hormone panels, and everything seems to be within normal ranges. One thing that stood out was my WBC count—it’s usually around 4 but increases to over 5.5 after breakfast. A hematologist told me that’s normal and not a concern since it rises after eating.

I work out 3–4 times a week (gym sessions), average about 13,000 steps a day, and follow intermittent fasting. Typically, I hit the gym around 6 AM, get home around 9, and then start eating at 1 PM. After my 9–5 job, I often want to do more—like cycling or other activities—but I just don’t have the energy. I feel fatigued, lightheaded (sometimes even a bit of vertigo), and drowsy. But oddly, if I try to nap or sleep early, I can’t fall asleep.

I’ve now got an appointment with an endocrinologist who ordered tests for cortisol, testosterone, and other hormones. I drink about two coffees a day, and occasionally an energy drink, but it doesn’t seem to help much.

Has anyone experienced something similar—post weight loss fatigue, possibly linked to fasting or workout timing? Any tips or similar stories would really help.",0,1744718374.0,AskMen,2,0.5,False

## What is Arbionis?

Arbionis is a **trading platform** designed to help users make smarter decisions when buying and selling crypto, stocks, and other assets. It combines **automated trading tools** with **real-time market analysis**, which makes it useful whether you're a total beginner or a seasoned trader.

It’s part of a new wave of trading platforms that try to eliminate guesswork by giving you data-backed insights and alerts. Think of it like having a trading assistant that doesn’t sleep or get emotional. It’s not trying to reinvent the wheel—it’s just making the wheel smarter and faster.

## Who Created Arbionis?

There’s not a ton of public information about the exact team behind Arbionis, which is something I noticed right away. However, it appears to be built by a group of developers and financial analysts who previously worked on similar platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge**.

While the anonymity might sound sketchy, it’s actually pretty common in the crypto space. That said, I’d be more comfortable if the company gave a bit more background on their team. Transparency matters, especially when money is involved.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Arbionis Today](https://tinyurl.com/ykk8rnks)
## How Does Arbionis Work?

Arbionis uses a combination of **AI-driven algorithms** and **market analytics** to provide trade suggestions and automation. You can manually trade or allow the system to execute trades based on parameters you set. It scans thousands of market signals per second to identify opportunities across multiple assets.

Once your account is funded, the system starts monitoring market activity in real time. You can set alerts, use auto-trade functions, or just analyze the data and make your own calls. It’s kind of like having a Bloomberg Terminal with training wheels.

## Arbionis Pros and Cons

- ✅ Real-time market scanning helps spot opportunities faster.
- ✅ User-friendly interface, even for beginners.
- ✅ You can trade multiple asset classes, not just crypto.

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Arbionis?

You can access Arbionis on just about any device:

- **Desktop:** Works great on both Windows and macOS.

Arbionis claims to be available in **most countries**, including:

- USA
- UK
- Canada
- Australia
- New Zealand
- Most of Europe
- Some parts of Asia and South America

It’s **not available** in countries with strict financial trading regulations like North Korea, Iran, and a few others. If you’re unsure, just try signing up. It’ll tell you pretty quickly if your country is supported.

## Arbionis – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is where Arbionis shines. Its algorithm scans thousands of data points to provide **real-time trading signals** and market trends. It doesn’t just give you raw data—it gives you insights that actually make sense.

This can be a major edge, especially in fast-moving markets where timing is everything.

### User-Friendly Interface

The UI is surprisingly clean. You don’t need to be a Wall Street veteran to understand what’s happening. All the major tools are easy to find, and the dashboard is customizable to your preferences.

There’s no clutter, no weird jargon, and no unnecessary pop-ups. It’s just smooth.

### Mobile Accessibility

I was able to check trades and alerts while waiting in line for coffee. That’s a win.

- ETFs

It’s great if you want to diversify without juggling multiple accounts across different platforms.

## Is Arbionis a Scam?

Based on my experience and the research I did, **Arbionis is not a scam**. It’s similar in structure to platforms like Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge, which have been around for a while and used by thousands of traders.

However, as with any trading platform, especially one that uses automation, there’s always risk involved. No platform can guarantee profits. So while Arbionis is a legit tool, **don't go all in without understanding the basics of trading**.

Just remember, this isn’t a fee—it’s money you actually use to trade.

Customer support is available **24/7 via live chat and email**. I tested the chat and got a response in under 5 minutes. Not bad.

There’s no phone support, which might be a downside for some users. But overall, the support team is responsive and helpful.

## How do you start trading on Arbionis?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the Arbionis homepage and fill out the registration form. It only asks for basic info like your name, email, and phone number. No long forms or unnecessary questions.

For example: I have one with a kitten dressed as a fairy, one with a dachshund dressed like a hotdog, one with a hamster drinking coffee…. That sort of stuff. 
Absolutely nothing inappropriate about them.

The family is now complaining that I need to dress more “professional”.

Part of me thinks that they have it out for me since their last complaint. Management got involved again and nothing will come of it.

1jzpxhs,https://i.redd.it/on8dtcwemzue1.png,Why Is Ethereum (ETH) Struggling Right Now?,"Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has seen a noticeable dip in price lately. While crypto markets are always volatile, several specific factors are contributing to ETH’s recent underperformance.

# 📉 1. Macroeconomic Pressures

Global economic uncertainty is affecting riskier assets like crypto. Concerns over inflation, interest rates, and potential recessions are pushing investors toward more stable assets. This flight to safety tends to put downward pressure on cryptocurrencies like Ethereum.

# 💥 2. Massive Long Liquidations

A surge in leveraged trading has led to waves of long liquidations. When Ethereum's price drops, those betting on a rise with borrowed funds are forced to sell, creating a cascading effect that accelerates the decline.

# 🪙 3. Rising Ethereum Supply

Ethereum’s supply had briefly turned deflationary after the Merge and EIP-1559, but it has since shifted back toward inflation. An increase in supply without corresponding demand tends to soften the price of ETH in the market.

# 🧠 4. Underperformance Compared to Bitcoin

Bitcoin has been outperforming ETH, partly thanks to increased institutional interest and the successful launch of Bitcoin ETFs. In contrast, Ethereum has seen less hype and slower growth in investment activity, causing the ETH/BTC ratio to dip.

# 🔧 5. Technical Challenges and Network Usage

Ethereum is still facing issues like high gas fees and reduced on-chain activity. Slower innovation, delays in scaling solutions, and reduced DApp usage have contributed to weaker fundamentals in the short term.

# 🇪🇺 Is Ethereum Allowed in the EU?

Yes—**Ethereum is fully legal and allowed in the European Union**. Under the EU's **MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets)** regulation, Ethereum and other digital assets can be used and traded, provided the platforms offering them are compliant. This regulatory clarity gives users in Europe confidence to invest and spend ETH safely.

I’ve been struggling with a strange, persistent fatigue for the past 4 years, and I’m hoping someone here might relate or have insights.

It all started after my weight loss journey. I went from 89kg to 74kg (I’m 178cm tall), and soon after, I began feeling constantly low on energy—not exactly sleepy, just drained and fatigued. This feeling isn’t every single day, but I’d say it hits me at least 5 times a week.

I’ve done comprehensive blood tests, including hormone panels, and everything seems to be within normal ranges. One thing that stood out was my WBC count—it’s usually around 4 but increases to over 5.5 after breakfast. A hematologist told me that’s normal and not a concern since it rises after eating.

I work out 3–4 times a week (gym sessions), average about 13,000 steps a day, and follow intermittent fasting. Typically, I hit the gym around 6 AM, get home around 9, and then start eating at 1 PM. After my 9–5 job, I often want to do more—like cycling or other activities—but I just don’t have the energy. I feel fatigued, lightheaded (sometimes even a bit of vertigo), and drowsy. But oddly, if I try to nap or sleep early, I can’t fall asleep.

I’ve now got an appointment with an endocrinologist who ordered tests for cortisol, testosterone, and other hormones. I drink about two coffees a day, and occasionally an energy drink, but it doesn’t seem to help much.

Has anyone experienced something similar—post weight loss fatigue, possibly linked to fasting or workout timing? Any tips or similar stories would really help.",1,1744717916.0,chronicfatigue,0,1.0,False

I accept donated ingredients, but it's not necessary to pick up something.  If you donate expired/rotting food I will block you.

I do not do special requests, bake sales, and non profits, so don't ask.  If you see something posted you want to pick up to give to a charity that would be great.  

But do not try to arrange something for me to make things for a specific reason.  My anxiety cannot handle it.

Please do not come here and suggest I take a class, or sell baked goods. That is ablist, unsupportive, and upsetting.

I think this would go without saying, but you need to tell me if you cannot make it.  After I wait an hour no call no show, I will move onto the next person.  If this happens repeatedly I will block you.  No exceptions.

I feel this goes without saying as well but I need to say it.  if you send me a message asking to borrow money I will block you.  No exceptions.

I am autistic/ADHD, and am the only one doing this, so please be kind.

Today, I have chocolate malt Robin egg cupcakes to give away.

I doubled the batch, and made a lot of cupcakes this time.

3 dozen, plus 5 cupcakes in a smaller pan.

The cake part is a moist chocolate cake, with a little bit of coffee in it.

The frosting is buttercream, one batch I ground up Robin eggs to put in the frosting, one I didn't.

I put vanilla malt powder in both batches of frosting, and the frosting all tastes the same.

And then I scooped it onto the cupcakes, and put Robin eggs as garnish on top.

These are perfect for Easter, for any malt Robin egg lover.

I have a small pan of 5, I will put with the pan of a dozen if someone has kids.

And I have cupcakes for 3 households.

This age is super exciting—your baby is probably sitting, crawling, teething, and maybe even trying to stand. So your shopping list will change a lot from the newborn days.

Here’s what really helped us:

1. Feeding Essentials

High Chair: Game changer. We got one from LuvLap and it made meal times way easier. Go for one that’s easy to clean—trust me, it WILL get messy.

Sippy Cups & Training Utensils: Straw sippy cups worked better than spout ones for us. Also, start giving soft spoons and silicone plates to encourage self-feeding.

Snack Containers: Those spill-proof snack cups are SO helpful once your baby starts snacking on the go.


2. Clothing & Accessories

Bibs: I bought cute cotton ones at first, then quickly switched to silicone bibs with a pocket—much easier to clean.

Sleep Sacks: Especially helpful if your baby kicks off the blanket every night.

Shoes (Optional): Not necessary for pre-walkers, but we did buy soft sole ones when our baby started cruising.


3. Toys That Actually Get Used

Stacking toys, shape sorters, and soft balls were hits.

Musical toys can be fun but also annoying. Get just one or two.

Board books are great—look for ones with textures and flaps. We found a few nice ones on Amazon and at local book fairs.


4. Mobility & Safety

Baby Gates: Once the crawling starts, you’ll want to block off certain areas.

Corner guards & outlet covers: I didn’t think we needed them until my baby banged into the coffee table.

Walker? Mixed opinions. We skipped it and just encouraged cruising along furniture.


5. Bath & Skincare

Bath Seat or Mat: Made bathing safer and more fun.

Mild Shampoo and Moisturizer: We stuck with Mamaearth and Cetaphil Baby—both worked well for sensitive skin.

Toothbrush & Toothpaste: Once the first tooth popped, we started brushing with a silicone finger brush and baby-safe toothpaste.


6. Pro Tips (from someone who's been there)

Don’t go overboard with clothes—babies outgrow them fast.

Buy in stages. What works at 6 months won’t be useful at 10 months.

Look for combo packs during sales on FirstCry, Hopscotch, or Amazon (especially during Big Billion Days or Great Indian Festival).

Second-hand stuff (like walkers or toys) can be a huge money-saver if you're open to it.


This phase is full of trial and error, but it’s also SO rewarding.

I’d like to share my current situation with you. I’m Peruvian and based in South America. Peru is one of the largest exporters of agro-industrial products in the region — meaning that many of the fruits, vegetables, coffee, or teas you consume in your country might actually come from here.

As an entrepreneur, I currently have access to very attractive pricing on coffee and tea — ideal for anyone with a distribution network or looking to build their own private label brand (white label) online. I also offer established brands of both coffee and tea.

Let me share a bit of information about these ventures. I usually don’t use social media much, but I’m now looking for ways to bring high-quality Peruvian products to more parts of the world. These products are truly premium — pure flavor, guaranteed quality.

Additionally, I can help source other Peruvian agro-industrial products such as **cacao, pisco** (a strong traditional Peruvian spirit), **blueberries**, or **asparagus**, depending on your needs.

👉 **My main question is simple**:  
Is there anyone here with a distribution network or interest in developing a private label for high-quality agro-industrial products?

- Ate a banana and had a lot of coffee
- Showered and did some pushups 
- Listened to hip hop music (specifically pop smoke) as I've failed in the past for going slow and hesitation. This helped with being more confident while driving (and giving less of a fuck).

During the lesson before the test, almost hit a bin man- so be extra careful when it comes to hazards.

Some people say think about the test as if you're driving a VIP. I'd say think about it more like you're driving a friend or family member- you need to look confident not just being safe. Being too safe might make you go too slow.

Might feel like you're never going to pass- but all it takes is one good drive and you're sorted for decades.

I decided to concentrate on the south and Osa Peninsula.

**Drake Bay**

* Flight from San Jose to Drake Bay, then picked up a rental car and went to Drake Bay town. Stayed at an Airbnb called Mango St Casita — not luxury, but quite a nice experience. Saw a lot of animals at the property (toucans, agoutis, iguanas).
* Absolutely loved Cocalito beach — the hike there from Drake Bay town is such an experience. We saw a tapir walking so close to us on our way there, white-faced monkeys in the forest nearby, and macaws directly on the beach.
* The town is also quite cute, though I can’t say that I’d recommend the snorkelling/diving tour to Cano Island — water wasn’t very transparent and we couldn’t see a lot, needed to move in a rush to barely see anything. But maybe it’s just me not being lucky.
* Best coffee we had in Costa Rica was probably at Café del Mar Drake Bay — it’s on the beach with a big sign saying Coffee Shop on the way to Cocalito.
* Munchies Stop is a cute local snack spot, opens early, and has empanadas and coffee.
* nigh guided tour with Picolina tours was an adventure! also The bug lady was recommended to us but she was not in town

**Dominical & Uvita**

* Then we drove to Dominical — the road from Drake Bay to the Dominical area is really bumpy and I’m not sure we’d make it without a Toyota Fortuner.
* Dominical is a chill American vibe town with a nice beach.
* Fruitas Frescas — a nice fruit shop.
* Made a short trip to Uvita and its beach, had breakfast on our way at Kunjani Cafe Dominicalito — beautiful view and nice food.
* Be aware of the low/high tide when you’re at Uvita beach — we walked fine through a tiny water level, but on our way back just 1 hour later, the water level was much higher and all of our trousers were soaked.

**Puerto Jimenez (El Remanso)**

* Stayed in El Remanso. Best service experience and the best food.
* The hotel offers a lot of activities and tours included in the price — they promise at least one activity per day, which is great for planning.
* Matapalo safari trip was amazing.
* They also organized our trip to Sirena station and it went very well — as we had to wake up very early, they prepared coffee and sandwiches to go, and the guide was with us for the entire trip, which was really helpful.
* Also, try their massage — it was unbelievable.
* We saw a lot of animals right near our bungalow — a tribe of squirrel monkeys, lots of coatis, and birds.
* There is no AC though our bungalow was quite well ventilated with 2 large fans 

**A few random tips**

* San Jose airport terminal duty-free is rather ridiculous — more expensive food than in London and very pricey souvenirs. If you don’t want to pay 20 dollars for socks with toucans, think about gifts before you get there.
* there are not so many mosquitos and insects as we expected and we barely used insect repellent 
* dollars are ok, but local colones are better, especially if youre planning to go to markets and fruit shops etc

Costa Rica is such an amazing country — full of animals, fulfilling food, friendly smiley people. I noticed no one ever asked me the quite common small talk question “what do you do for a living?” during our entire trip. You can just live and feel there with no expectations or judgments — something that I do miss being in a big bustling city.

1jzpo2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1jzpo2h/is_this_chronic_fatigue/,Is this Chronic Fatigue?,"Hi. I'm 21F, Black African, 65kg/143.3lbs, 165cm with diagnosed ADHD and I live in Ireland. I've never consumed drugs or alcohol and I've never smoked. I tried to seperate this into subsections but I'm not sure how well I've done that.

TLDR; I have what I think is chronic fatigue, I want to find out how to fix it.

\--Medication

I've been on ADHD meds since last year August. Initially it was Ritalin (which I stopped because it caused me depression) but I'm now on Tyvense 40mg. I started taking Vitamin D about 2 weeks ago somewhat consistently and in the past I took Benfotiamine for maybe 3 weeks.

\--Health history:

I'm not sure how relevant this is but my mom has low blood pressure and low iron, my dad's side of the family is diabetic but he's not. My dad snores a lot so my mom doesn't share a room with him. My mom doesn't sleep well (she says she mostly sleeps in the morning before work). I think I sleep relatively okay. I usually wake up once or twice during the night. I'm usually very sensitive to noise so any sound will wake me up(I sleep listening to white noise so if my headphones die, I will also wake up). My sister says I snore sometimes but that's rarely I'd say. I've always been someone who walks. Especially between 2022-2024 but recently I don't have time.

\---Backstory:

This all started in summer 2021 so its been almost four years now. I had what I think was covid but I'm not really sure as I never took a test, but I remember not being able to stand for more than 5 or so seconds without feeling short of breath and very tired. I also had a cough. This same summer I lost 14kg by intermittent fasting and cardio btw(79kg to 65kg). I was eating 1800 at first but then I reduced it to1200 after I started eating once at the end of the day. After summer, I went back to uni and underwent a huge lifestyle change: I was working for the first time ever in fast food, going to the gym and also studying a lot. This was when I started noticing that after working out, I'd feel very tired and I'd try to drink coffee+monster but it would only make it worse, so I stopped going to the gym. I'm not sure how relevant this is but my split was upper body and lower body with 8 exercises 3 sets. My diet was bad at the time. I was eating a lot of McDonalds and a lot of protein shakes and processed foods e.g. Rice cakes. I was eating 1500 still at this time. At the time I also noticed shortness of breath. I still have this (I think).

This carried on up until 2022 where I thought I had low Iron so I went to get blood tested at the GP but everything seemed normal. He told me to take Zenflore which helped after a few days and I felt much better but the tiredness would come back if I stopped. I took Zenflore for 2 years. It was while taking this that I got diagnosed with ADHD (2024)because I realized that while I \*was\* less tired, I just could not pay attention to anything and it took a lot of effort to study and if I was tired, half of my study session would be me \*trying\* to get myself to concentrate.

\---Trying to fix the issue:

I'm Muslim so during Ramadan we have to fast. Depending on the season, it can be anywhere from 12-16 (or more) hours. In any case, whenever I fast i've noticed my symptoms get way better(ketosis?) i.e., more energy, a bit more calm (but my ability to concentrate and no get distracted is still there) but this is not a long term solution for the fatigue because I need to eat to take my meds etc. Also when I do end up eating, I feel very tired and have to rest. I googled this and apparently its because of high carb consumption?.

I started strength training in January this year and I was doing it consistently up until March when Ramadan came and I stopped because I just couldn't find the energy. Prior to Ramadan though, I felt way better, I was stronger, my meds felt very smooth but now that I haven't been working out, it's the exact opposite.

What triggered me to write this post is this: I went for a walk today on an empty stomach then came home to eat breakfast (high protein + fiber) and take my meds then leave to the library to study. I'm now at the library feeling immensely tired and I feel this tension on the upper left and right side of my head. It feels like my meds aren't working. I'm reminded of how I used to feel constantly a year ago and I just want to be healthy again.

\--Conclusion:

My medication really helps when it's active but when I don't take it, it's still the same issue. So medication is clearly not much of a long-term solution. This issue has caused me so much stress and I'm very sad because I'm young and these are meant to be the best years of my life but it feels like I'm wasting away feeling tired all the time with no idea what the cure is. I've spent money I dont have on GP visits to take blood tests that show I'm completely fine.",1,1744717164.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1jzpmnj,https://i.redd.it/ofom4zjhjzue1.png,Using Bitcoin in Cyprus: A Practical Guide to Everyday Crypto,"Cyprus has steadily evolved into one of Europe’s crypto-friendly hotspots. With a tech-savvy population, supportive regulation, and an increasing number of businesses accepting digital assets, Bitcoin usage in Cyprus is growing far beyond investment—people are beginning to use it in everyday life.

Here’s what you need to know about using Bitcoin in Cyprus, from regulations to real-world spending opportunities.

# 🇨🇾 Bitcoin: Legal and Accessible

In Cyprus, Bitcoin is fully legal to own, trade, and use. Individuals are free to buy, hold, and spend Bitcoin, while businesses operating in the crypto space follow a clear licensing and compliance framework. This regulatory clarity encourages broader public adoption and creates a safer environment for both consumers and providers.

# 🏦 How People Use Bitcoin in Cyprus

# 1. Everyday Purchases

More Cypriots are using Bitcoin to make day-to-day purchases. Whether it’s grabbing coffee in Nicosia, buying electronics in Limassol, or shopping online, Bitcoin is becoming part of the mainstream conversation.

Some businesses have integrated crypto payment solutions, while others accept crypto manually by QR code. More commonly, people use crypto-linked debit cards that allow instant conversion of Bitcoin into euros for use at any retailer that accepts standard card payments.

# 2. Education

The University of Nicosia famously accepts Bitcoin for tuition payments, and has been a pioneer in crypto education. This forward-thinking approach has positioned Cyprus as a notable destination for both academic and practical blockchain adoption.

# 3. Freelancing & Remote Income

Cyprus is home to a growing community of digital nomads and freelancers. Many of them accept Bitcoin for freelance work, enabling fast international payments without traditional bank fees or delays.

# 4. Peer-to-Peer Transactions

Bitcoin is also commonly used for peer-to-peer payments between friends, business partners, and family—both locally and abroad. It offers a quick, secure, and transparent way to send money without relying on traditional intermediaries.

# 🛒 Where Can You Spend Bitcoin in Cyprus?

Bitcoin-friendly businesses can increasingly be found across major cities. These include:

* Retail outlets and tech stores

Greeting Citizens of the Settled Systems and Beyond the Starfield...

Today I have just started my SECOND proper full playthrough of Starfield and I'm going to use this sub to record my thoughts, opinions, analysis and observations as I go through the game\*. Please feel free to comment and contribute and agree or disagree with anything written. Or if you have your own thoughts, options and observations on anything discussed please do comment as comments and input are most welcome. 

I  am playing on Xbox Series X with the Shattered Space DLC and no modifications. I'm playing with 'Normal' settings across the board. I often play games on easy because quite simply I'm not very good. 

My character is called Xeo and they are an introverted and hero-worshipped Neon street rat from a Ronin background. Picture to follow. Xeo is not unwilling to operate outside the law or by bending the rules but they will never act outright evil. Xeo will try and avoid collateral damage and will operate in as moral a manner as possible. Xeo will not steal and values politeness. But they also have an edge and will never outright exclude operating on the darker side of the moral spectrum. That's how I will approach my playthrough.

**SESSION 1**

Opens on Vectara and the evocative music immediately made my spine tingle (I'm using the official Xbox headphones for this playthrough). I've just finished playing Assassin's Creed: Valhalla on the Series X and immediately in comparison I'm seeing the impressive graphical credentials of Starfield. I'm seeing much greater detail in the uniforms, more realistic movement animations and better lighting effects in the opening mining sequence. I'm far from a technical expert in these things, very much a layman in fact, but I'm modestly impressed. 

I'm really glad to be back in the Settled Systems. I converse with Heller and Lin and I'm reminded that I will run back into both later on. I grab my first artefact and have my first gunfight and space battle. 

I'm reminded how underwhelming I find Vasco (they got 'robot companion' right with Kaiser later in the game) and along comes Barrett who I've never quite enjoy as a character. I quickly dispatch the spacer ships and make short work of their captain on the moon of Kreet. Even after exploring only this first/second location and I'm already encumbered primarily with weapons that I plan to sell at the Trade Authority when landing in New Atlantis spaceport. 

It's great to be back in New Atlantis! This city is such an accomplishment. I look up at the skyscrapers, and I'm reminded that New Atlantis has good verticality, and while it may not be that wide and big there is a lot to do, lots of places to visit and people to interact with. It is a spectacular cityscape. I listen to various conversations that I encounter and speak with some French guy. All this helps world build but no missions yet.  Then I'm invited to investigate some 'brownouts' and I fetch a coffee for the janitor Donna in the NAT station on my way to the Lodge for my meeting with Constellation.

And there they are; Walter makes some slightly insulting remark about my trustworthiness, while Matteo defends me and Sarah and Noel introduce me to the interstellar scenario which they are experiencing. Matteo and Noel have very calming dispositions and welcoming vibes. I'm wary of both Sarah and Walter. I agree to help and now I’m considering what to do prior to jetting off to ‘the old Neighbourhood’ with Sarah. 

I may neglect the Constellation quest for the time being and if possible I might jump right into what was my least enjoyable questline previously; Ryujin. Let's see where the mood takes me tomorrow....

1jzpj2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1jzpj2y/the_synergy_between_idebenone_and_carnosic_acid/,"The synergy between Idebenone and Carnosic acid, two powerful antioxidants (Repost)","[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4487815/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4487815/)

This study explicitly stated a synergy between Carnosic Acid and Idebenone, both of which I had planned to upload. (Carnosic acid is already uploaded).      [*this is a repost*](https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/z404cd/the_synergy_between_idebenone_and_carnosic_acid)

https://preview.redd.it/xwlw8i70izue1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a814d8cb4fcbd71c4c59a6531e063cd35ee24343

Idebenone activates the electron transport chain, complex 3, to generate ATP and reduce oxidative stress.

Unfortunately, due to its lower lipophilicity, it can accidentally inhibit complex 1, which in an isolated environment can generate oxidative stress. However, in healthy cells, the existence of NQO1 naturally counters this, which is why Idebenone is not toxic, and generally beneficial.

But NQO1's production is limited by Nrf2, which just so happens to be what Carnosic acid stimulates.

From section: Idebenone and combination therapy: wave of the future?

""Therefore, idebenone and an Nrf2-inducing agent may be a strongly synergistic drug combination that is far more effective than either drug alone

https://preview.redd.it/suvxkau0izue1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=308aaecc8c4dc35b445c4145f8f385bb9308ea26

Carnosic acid was described by the same group to activate the Nrf2 pathway in both neurons and astrocytes and exhibit protection against focal ischemia/reperfusion brain injury \[81\].""

Something similar was found with chlorogenic acid, which is naturally found in coffee (caffeinated or not). But by comparison, Carnosic acid is far more potent.

""Carnosic Acid (CA) is a pro-electrophilic compound that, in response to oxidation, is converted to its electrophilic form. This can interact and activate the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE transcription pathway, triggering the synthesis of endogenous antioxidant “phase 2” enzymes. However, given the nature of its chemical structure, CA also exhibits direct antioxidant effects.""

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3859717/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3859717/)

Despite being a direct antioxidant, these indirect mechanisms relate to Idebenone in their specificity:

""Overall, the current data strongly suggest that, instead of being a direct antioxidant, idebenone increases the ability of cells to counteract oxidative stress by upregulating their physiological defence mechanisms and decreasing the production of oxidative radicals. However, there is significant doubt that protection against ROS-induced damage is the only molecular activity of idebenone that confers cytoprotection.""

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7708875/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7708875/)

Idebenone directly activates the electron transport chain complex 3, irrespective of any upstream damage. This is important because it means it directly facilitates the production of cellular energy (ATP) and reduction of oxidative stress, keeping cells impervious to damage and maintaining their excitation. As noted before, in unhealthy patients the only perceived weakness of Idebenone can be reversed with Carnosic Acid.

The increased ATP from Idebenone prolongs excitatory currents from AMPA, which makes it function similarly to ampakine style AMPA PAMs: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7511959/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7511959/)

This also probably explains how electric monitoring predict a nootropic effect in healthy people subjected to an experimental cerebral deficit model: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9706371/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9706371/)

Notably Idebenone appears to increase the release of noradrenaline and serotonin, with no effect on dopamine: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2987589/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2987589/)

And Carnosic Acid mimicks the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines without any GABAergic function by increasing serotonin and decreasing noradrenaline (I find it sedating, use it to go to bed sometimes): [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260165234\_Key\_role\_of\_carnosic\_acid\_in\_the\_anxiolytic-like\_activity\_of\_Rosmarinus\_officinalis\_linn\_in\_rodents](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260165234_Key_role_of_carnosic_acid_in_the_anxiolytic-like_activity_of_Rosmarinus_officinalis_linn_in_rodents)

Carnosic Acid is known to be perhaps the strongest antioxidant found in nature. I have Idebenone coming soon I'm going to try out, but I have no idea what to expect from it. It will be a neat n=1 experiment.

Fun fact about Carnosic Acid before I end the post, it seems to increase neurotrophic growth factors too. Initially I tried it because I read it upregulates tyrosine hydroxylase, this was a while back when I thought that meant something, but instead got super sleepy from it. Come to find out it's not at all stimulating.

Anyways, that's all for now. Will probably make a post on Istradefylline soon.

[The Consequences of China’s New Rare Earths Export Restrictions](https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions)

[Photo: Matt Cardy\/Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/s5h4se0mfzue1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=c13f09fc56e7252d28710db7fcb5272d5d726af2)

On April 4, China’s Ministry of Commerce imposed export restrictions on seven rare earth elements (REEs) and magnets used in the defense, energy, and automotive sectors in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff increases on Chinese products. The new restrictions apply to 7 of 17 REEs—samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium—and requires companies to secure special export licenses to export the minerals and magnets.

**Q1: To what extent will the most recent export restrictions on rare earths impact U.S. sourcing of these critical minerals for defense technologies?**

**A1:** There are various types of export restrictions: non-automatic licensing, tariffs, quotas, and an outright ban. The new restrictions are not a ban; rather, they require firms to apply for a license to export rare earths. This development has three implications: first, there will likely be a pause in exports as the Chinese government establishes this licensing system. Second, there is also likely to be disruptions in supply to some U.S. firms given that the announcement also placed 16 U.S. entities on its export control list, limiting them from receiving dual-use goods. All but one of the firms on the list are in the defense and aerospace industries. It is unclear how China will implement the new licensing system. And third, the licensing system may be dynamic and could incentivize countries across the world to cooperate with China to prevent disruptions in their rare earths supply.

**Q2: What is the significance of the focus on heavy rare earths given U.S. supply chain vulnerabilities?**

**A2:** The restrictions apply to seven medium and heavy rare earths: samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium. The United States is particularly vulnerable for these supply chains. Until 2023, China accounted for [99 percent](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/business/china-rare-earths-exports.html) of global heavy REEs processing, with only minimal output from a refinery in Vietnam. However, that facility has been shut down for the past year due to a tax dispute, effectively giving China a monopoly over supply. China did not impose restrictions on light rare earths, for which a more diverse set of countries undertake processing.

**Q3: Why are rare earths significant to U.S. national security?**

**A3:** REEs are crucial for a range of [defense technologies](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3700059/dod-looks-to-establish-mine-to-magnet-supply-chain-for-rare-earth-materials/#:~:text=The%20F%2D35%2C%20for%20instance,class%20submarine%20needs%209%2C200%20pounds.), including F-35 fighter jets, Virginia- and Columbia-class submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, Predator unmanned aerial vehicles, and the Joint Direct Attack Munition series of smart bombs. For example, the F-35 fighter jet contains over 900 pounds of REEs. An Arleigh Burke-class DDG-51 destroyer requires approximately 5,200 pounds, while a Virginia-class submarine uses around 9,200 pounds.

The United States is already on the back foot when it comes to manufacturing these defense technologies. China is rapidly expanding its munitions production and acquiring advanced weapons systems and equipment at a pace [five to six times faster](https://features.csis.org/preparing-the-US-industrial-base-to-deter-conflict-with-China/) than the United States. While China is preparing with a wartime mindset, the United States continues to operate under peacetime conditions. Even before the latest restrictions, the U.S. defense industrial base struggled with limited capacity and lacked the ability to scale up production to meet defense technology demands. Further bans on critical minerals inputs will only widen the gap, enabling China to strengthen its military capabilities more quickly than the United States.

**Q4: Is the U.S. rare earths industry ready to fill the gap in the event of a shortfall?**

**A4:** No. There is no heavy rare earths separation happening in the United States at present. The development of these capabilities is currently underway. In its [2024 National Defense Industrial Strategy](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3700059/dod-looks-to-establish-mine-to-magnet-supply-chain-for-rare-earth-materials/), the Department of Defense (DOD) set a goal to develop a complete mine-to-magnet REE supply chain that can meet all U.S. defense needs by 2027. Since 2020, the DOD has committed over $439 million toward building domestic supply chains. In 2020, the Pentagon awarded MP Materials [$9.6 million](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/release/article/2418542/dod-announces-rare-earth-element-awards-to-strengthen-domestic-industrial-base/) through the DPA Title III program for a light rare earths separation facility at Mountain Pass, California. In 2022, the Pentagon awarded an additional [$35 million](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2941793/dod-awards-35-million-to-mp-materials-to-build-us-heavy-rare-earth-separation-c/) for a heavy rare earths processing facility. These facilities would be the first of their kind in the United States, fully integrating the rare earths supply chain from mining, separating, and leaching in Mountain Pass to refining and magnet production in Fort Worth, Texas. But even when these facilities are fully operational, MP Materials will only be producing [1,000 tons](https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2023/2/10/us-begins-forging-rare-earth-supply-chain#:~:text=To%20fully%20domesticate%20the%20magnet,facilities%2C%20according%20to%20the%20company.) of neodymium-boron-iron (NdFeB) magnets by the end of 2025—less than 1 percent of the [138,000 tons](https://www.stanfordmagnets.com/the-demand-for-neodymium-has-significantly-increased.html#:~:text=Thanks%20to%20rare%20earth%20reserves,the%20world&apos;s%20second%2Dlargest%20producer) of NdFeB magnets China produced in 2018. In 2024, MP Materials announced record production of [1,300 tons](https://www.mining.com/mp-materials-produces-rare-earth-metal-in-texas/) of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide. In the same year, China produced an estimated [300,000](https://www.mining.com/mp-materials-produces-rare-earth-metal-in-texas/) tons of NdFeB magnets.

The DOD has thrown its support behind Lynas Rare Earth’s U.S. subsidiary, Lynas USA, as well. The company was awarded a [$30.4 million](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2488672/dod-announces-rare-earth-element-award-to-strengthen-domestic-industrial-base/#:~:text=Lynas%20Rare%20Earths%20Ltd%2C%20the,rare%20earth%20elements%20(LREE).) DPA Title III grant in 2021 for a U.S. separation facility for light REEs and another [$120 million](https://www.businessdefense.gov/news/2022/DoD-Awards-Key-Contract-for-Domestic-Heavy-Rare-Earth-Separation-Capability.html#:~:text=The%20Department%20of%20Defense%20(DoD,Rare%20Earth%20Elements%20(HREE).) in 2022 for a heavy REE processing facility. These DPA investments are an important step in building completely independent supply chains for REE magnets.  

Even with recent investments, the United States is a long way off from meeting the DOD’s goal for a mine-to-magnet REE supply chain independent of China, and it is even further from rivaling foreign adversaries in this strategic industry. U.S. capabilities are largely early-stage. For example, in January 2025, USA Rare Earths produced its first [sample](https://www.mining.com/usa-rare-earth-produces-dysprosium-oxide-at-texas-round-top-mine/#:~:text=The%20only%20active%20rare%20earths%20mine%20in,including%20praseodymium%2Dneodymium%20(NdPr)%20oxide%2C%20cerium%20and%20lanthanum.&text=Dysprosium%20is%20a%20key%20component%20in%20technologies,in%20many%20neodymium%20(NdFeB)%20rare%20earth%20magnets.) of dysprosium oxide purified to 99.1 percent. Produced using ore from the Round Top deposit in Texas and processed at a research facility in Wheat Ridge Colorado, the company has called the development a breakthrough for the domestic rare earths industry. However, significant work remains to turn production of samples in a laboratory into full scale commercial production capable of reducing reliance on China. Developing mining and processing capabilities requires a long-term effort, meaning the United States will be on the back foot for the foreseeable future.

**Q5: Could the United States have seen this coming?**

**A5:** Yes. A number of policies have foreshadowed that REE export restrictions were on the horizon. China first weaponized rare earths in 2010 when it [banned exports](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/business/global/23rare.html) to Japan over a fishing trawler dispute. Between 2023 and 2025, China began imposing export restrictions of strategic materials to the United States, including gallium, germanium, antimony, graphite, and tungsten.

In 2023, the Select Committee on the Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party published a report titled [*Reset, Prevent, Build: A Strategy to Win America's Economic Competition with the Chinese Communist Party*](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/reset-prevent-build-scc-report.pdf). It recommended that “Congress should incentivize the production of rare earth element magnets, which are the principal end-use for rare earth elements and used in electric vehicles, wind turbines, wireless technology, and countless other products.” Specifically, it advocated for Congress to establish tax incentives to promote U.S. manufacturing.

In December 2023, China imposed a [ban of REE extraction and separation technologies](https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-chinas-ban-rare-earths-processing-technology-exports-means). It had a notable impact on developing REE supply chain capabilities outside of China due to two main factors. First, China possesses specialized technical expertise in this field that other countries do not. For instance, it has an absolute advantage in solvent extraction processing techniques for rare earths, an area where Western companies have faced challenges both in implementing advanced technological operations and in addressing environmental concerns. Second, while multiple facilities for separation, processing, and manufacturing are currently being built, completing construction and bringing them fully online will take several years.

**Q6: Are there any international partners from which the United States could alternatively source heavy rare earths and fill the supply gap?**

**A6:** While several countries are working to develop their light and heavy rare earths deposits, China maintains a monopoly on refined heavy rare earths for the time being. Australia, Brazil, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Japan, and Vietnam all have initiatives and investments underway to bolster key REE mining, processing, and research and development (R&D) as well as magnet manufacturing. For the United States to build alternative sourcing partners for long-term supply chain security, it is important to continue to provide financial and diplomatic support to ensure the success of these initiatives.

Australia is working to develop its Browns Range to become the [first significant](https://northernminerals.com.au/rare-earths/) dysprosium producer outside of China. The deposit has estimated dysprosium reserves of [2,294 tons](https://www.mining-technology.com/projects/browns-range-rare-earths-project/?cf-view), to be unlocked in a multistage process resulting in [279,000 kg](https://www.mining-technology.com/projects/browns-range-rare-earths-project/?cf-view) of dysprosium per year. However, much work remains to be done to build processing and refining capacity outside of China. Australia’s Lynas Rare Earths is the largest producer of separated rare earths outside of China, but still [sends oxides to China](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/breaking-chinas-near-monopoly-on-rare-earths-will-be-easier-said-than-done/) for refining. Australia is expected to be reliant on China for REE refining until [at least 2026](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/lynas-rare-earths-signs-updated-contract-with-us-govt-texas-facility-2023-07-31/#:~:text=Lynas&apos;%20Texas%20facility%20will%20serve,in%20the%20financial%20year%202026.).

Working with international partners can also help to overcome gaps in technological know-how when it comes to REE separation and processing. A few countries lead the way in developing critical minerals and REE-specific R&D initiatives to support the development of the strategic sector. The [Australian Critical Minerals Research and Development Hub](https://research.csiro.au/critical-minerals-hub/about-us/the-hub/) is working to boost international R&D cooperation on critical minerals. The hub includes rare earth and downstream processing [initiatives](https://research.csiro.au/critical-minerals-hub/research-projects/) lead by government agencies working in [partnership](https://www.csiro.au/en/news/all/articles/2024/march/critical-minerals-hub-update) with industry and universities to boost technical capacity. Japan has the [Center for Rare Earths Research](https://u.muroran-it.ac.jp/kidorui/muroran-materia/en/overview.html) within its Muroran Institute of Technology as well as a [joint initiative](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2012.11009#:~:text=Concentration%20challenge,Elements%2C%20also%20based%20in%20Hanoi.) with Vietnam to improve REE extraction and processing at the Rare Earth Research and Technology Transfer Centre in Hanoi. The initiative was launched in 2012 as Japan looked to strengthen and diversify its REE supply chains in response to China’s REE export ban in 2010.

# APRIL 14TH, 2025 ~ China’s Halt of Critical Minerals Poses Risk for U.S. Military Programs

[China’s Halt of Critical Minerals Poses Risk for U.S. Military Programs – DNyuz](https://dnyuz.com/2025/04/14/chinas-halt-of-critical-minerals-poses-risk-for-u-s-military-programs/)

https://preview.redd.it/w6i5asprezue1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=49c12fc4611d94f2c4e169241b6bb1390d37bf26

On Air Force fighter jets, magnets made of rare earth minerals that are mined or processed in China are needed to start the engines and provide emergency power.

On precision-guided ballistic missiles favored by the Army, magnets containing Chinese rare earth materials rotate the tail fins that allow missiles to home in on small or moving targets. And on new electric and battery-powered drones being adapted by Marines, rare earth magnets are irreplaceable in the compact electric motors.

China’s decision to retaliate against President Trump’s sharp increase in tariffs by ordering restrictions on the exports of a wide range of critical minerals and magnets is a warning shot across the bow of American national security, industry and defense experts said.

***In announcing that it will now require special export licenses for six heavy rare earth metals, which are refined entirely in China, as well as rare earth magnets, 90 percent of which are produced in China, Beijing has reminded the Pentagon — if, indeed, it needed reminding — that a wide swath of American weaponry is dependent on China.***

“This decision is hugely consequential for our national security,” said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Beijing, by beginning with what one Air Force official called a “heads-up” shot meant to signal how much more harm it could inflict should it choose, has left itself plenty of room to escalate. Beijing could also move on from the licensing restrictions to impose tariffs, quotas or even an all-out ban.

Rare earths are a group of 17 elements, including neodymium, yttrium, scandium and dysprosium, that are difficult to separate into usable forms. They are not actually rare at all but can be difficult to extract from the earth, and the process of mining and refining them into usable form carries substantial environmental costs.

They are present in almost every form of American defense technology. They can form very powerful magnets, for use in fighter jets, warships, missiles, tanks and lasers. Yttrium is required for high-temperature jet engine coatings; it allows thermal barrier coatings on turbine blades to stop aircraft engines from melting midflight.

According to the Defense Department, every F-35 fighter contains around 900 pounds of rare earth materials. Some submarines need more than 9,200 pounds of the materials.

***Across the American defense industry, aerospace and weapons companies have small stockpiles of the rare earths — the industry term for the 17 elements. That is enough, defense industry analysts say, to meet their needs for months rather than years.***

The Pentagon also has stockpiles of some rare earths, but those reserves are not enough to sustain defense companies indefinitely, one official said.

“China mines and refines most of the world’s rare earths, and dominates the downstream supply chain,” said Aaron Jerome, a trader at Lipmann Walton and Co., a metals trading company based in Britain. That supply-chain dominance allows Beijing some say over just how much weaponry that is dependent on the rare earths will cost, giving it enormous power over America’s defense industrial base.

Mr. Jerome pointed to what he called “the F-35 magnet debacle.” Back in 2022, the Pentagon temporarily stopped deliveries of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 after the manufacturer acknowledged that an alloy made in China was in a component of the stealth fighter jet, violating federal defense acquisition rules.

At the time, the Pentagon said a magnet containing the alloy used in part of the integrated power package posed no security problem.

But just one month later, the Pentagon allowed the deliveries to continue while it looked for another source for the magnets. Wherever the magnets are coming from now, some component of it is controlled by Beijing’s lock on the supply chain, Mr. Jerome said.

With Beijing now requiring that its exporters of rare earths first receive express permission from the government before sending the material to the United States, American defense companies may see prices shoot up soon, industry experts said.

As recently as the 1980s, the United States was a leader in rare earth production, through the Mountain Pass mine in California. But by 2002, Mountain Pass had shut down, with China dominating the market. Mountain Pass is now owned by MP Materials and is operating again, but it does not come close to Chinese production, industry experts said.

The Aerospace Industries Association, representing defense contractors, two years ago called again for the United States to shore up its minerals supply chain to better secure access for the industry.

“U.S. global leadership in aerospace and defense hinges on a secure and resilient supply chain — particularly for the critical minerals used in the production of cutting-edge aircraft technology,” Eric Fanning, the organization’s president, said at the time.

China has flexed its muscle over the rare earth supply chain in the past. In 2010, Beijing halted rare earths trade with Japan following Japan’s detention of a Chinese fishing trawler captain. The Chinese move caught the attention of the United States, alerting it to the threat posed by China’s control over the minerals’ supply chain.

In 2017, during his first term, Mr. Trump signed an executive order aimed at boosting U.S. domestic production, and President Joseph R. Biden Jr. followed suit during his administration, allocating even more money for rare earth extraction and refinement facilities.

The Pentagon has been adding to its stockpile since the 2010 episode involving Japan, and “we have more of a stockpile than we did 15 years ago,” said Dan Blumenthal, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. But, he added, “that will not last long enough.” American defense companies, he said, “should be very worried.”

There is historical precedent for the United States’ finding alternatives to crucial elements and minerals during wartime. In World War II, German U-boats sank many Allied cargo ships carrying bauxite from Suriname. “We would potentially have lost the war if we did not get alternative sources for bauxite,” said Seth G. Jones, author of the upcoming book “The American Edge: The Military Tech Nexus and the Sources of Great Power Dominance.”

The United States turned to Arkansas and built a large stockpile of bauxite, used to build airplanes, from mines there.

MP Materials (MP), The Metals Company (TMC), and USA Rare Earth (USAR) stocks garnered significant retail attention on Monday following news that China is halting the exports of critical minerals in the ongoing trade war with the United States.

USA Rare Earth and MP Materials were among the top trending symbols on Stocktwits as of 3:00 am ET on Tuesday.

MP Materials rose 7% in extended trading after jumping more than 21% on Monday, while USA Rare Earth surged 41.4% during the regular trading hours.

Rare earth minerals and magnets are used in various industries, from electronic vehicles to mobile phones.

According to a report by The New York Times, Beijing ordered restrictions on exporting six heavy rare earth metals, which are refined entirely in China, on April 4. The government also put curbs on rare earth magnets, 90% of which are produced in China.

The [report ](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/business/china-rare-earths-exports.html)said that the shipments have been halted as China is drafting a new system to regulate the exports of critical minerals, and it could prevent supplies from reaching certain companies, including American military contractors.

The Donald Trump administration is reportedly looking to counter this by preparing an executive order to stockpile rare earth minerals from the deep sea.

MP Materials, which produces cerium, lanthanum, and neodymium, also has refining operations in China. However, the top rare earth minerals-producing U.S. company is rapidly expanding its domestic refining operations.

USA Rare Earth is currently building a rare earth magnet-making facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma, and has mining rights at several places in the U.S.

Retail sentiment on Stocktwits about USA Rare Earth remained ‘extremely bullish’ (95/100), while retail chatter was ‘extremely high.’

One retail investor said there is a growing speculation that The Metals Company, which has permits for deep sea mining, could partner with MP Materials to process the minerals.

Another trader asked others not to sell the stocks, as China will likely continue using rare earth metals in the trade war with the U.S.

1jzph36,https://i.redd.it/1osk7f4yhzue1.png,"Bitcoin Usage in Germany: Trends, Adoption, and Everyday Use","As cryptocurrency continues to gain global traction, Germany stands out as one of the most progressive countries when it comes to embracing Bitcoin. From legal clarity to growing merchant adoption, Bitcoin usage in Germany has moved well beyond speculation—it's now being used for real-world transactions, investments, and even everyday spending.

In this article, we explore how Bitcoin is used in Germany, who’s using it, where it’s accepted, and what the future might hold for crypto in one of Europe’s most influential economies.

# Germany’s Progressive Stance on Bitcoin

Germany has taken a forward-thinking approach to cryptocurrency regulation. In 2013, it became the first country to recognize Bitcoin as **""private money""**, allowing it to be used for payments and trading under existing financial regulations.

Later, in 2020, Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) took it a step further by defining **crypto assets as financial instruments**, paving the way for banks and fintech companies to offer crypto-related services legally and securely.

# Key Legal Highlights:

* Bitcoin is **not illegal** and can be used for **buying goods and services**.
* Individuals can hold, trade, and use Bitcoin without requiring a license (unless they offer custodial services).
* Profits from Bitcoin held over **one year** are **tax-free** for individuals—a major incentive for long-term investors.

# How Bitcoin Is Being Used in Germany

# 1. Investment and Trading

Many Germans are investing in Bitcoin as a long-term asset or trading it for short-term gains. Platforms like **Bitpanda**, **Binance**, and **Coinbase** are widely used, and there’s growing interest in **Bitcoin ETFs** and other crypto investment vehicles.

# 2. Spending and Payments

A growing number of businesses in Germany accept Bitcoin as a form of payment, especially in larger cities like Berlin and Munich. These include:

* Cafés, restaurants, and bars
* Online retailers
* Tech and creative agencies
* Co-working spaces

Additionally, crypto payment processors like **BitPay**, **CoinGate**, and [**Spendo.com**](http://Spendo.com) enable merchants to accept Bitcoin and convert it to euros instantly.

# 3. Remittances and Cross-Border Transfers

Bitcoin is also being used by people in Germany to send money internationally, bypassing traditional banking fees and delays. This is particularly useful for freelancers, remote workers, and small business owners.

# Where Can You Spend Bitcoin in Germany?

Bitcoin acceptance is still growing, but some hotspots and industries stand out:

So today I thought it was Monday and on Monday I thought Sunday. So on Tuesday, thinking it was Monday, I sat down to prepare my case for court the following day, 15.04 (this is importance for later).  This case is an extensive, multi front case for my bankruptcy, in which I am self representing vs 9 suits, packed into ½ an hour in court. I needed to be prepared. 
That morning, I spent half an hour interviewing a caregiver for my mother and we spent time discussing how Tuesdays would be optimal and that she could start today. Tuesday! Today ding ding. Nope. 
We finish the interview, she started her job and I go back to prepping my case. 
I diligently stack all my papers in piles, make a cup of coffee, take an extra half a dose of my Adderall and begin working. 
Suddenly I look at my phone, see a notification from my Google calendar that I am late for court. Now, my Google Calendar has sent me false notifications in the past as if it was a day earlier, so I thought it was one of those. I then double check the calendar and realize my mistake…
Frantically, I stuff everything from my desk into my bag, my eyes swelling up into tears. I quickly get dressed and hail a cab, while fumbling to find my court invitation to find the address. 
I can’t find it, so I just google the address of the court and jump in a cab. I cry the whole way there, pay an exorbitant amount of money and reach the courthouse with my mind full of explanations for the judge.
The door in the courthouse is locked, I was already late so I think that they closed. I see a security guard, so I knock on the glass. He opens the door and asks me what I need. I tell him I’m late for court court. He says, “ma’am today’s a holiday. To Which I respond, “Yes, I know, they (in my mind-those bastards) scheduled me in for today. I have an invitation.”  He asks me to pull it up. I finally find it, show it to him and say “you see, 15.04”
He looks at it with me and says, just as I realize what he’s about to say; “No ma’am, it says 14.05. Next month.”
…
Silver lining; I’m not late to court!

It’s one thing if it was just messing up the days, I could make sense of that because there was a holiday on Sunday so that week started on Monday and I was with my kids and my grandkids and my daughter came from overseas with my grandson. Fine. But I’ve seen the court invitation several times, people told me that it doesn’t make sense that it’s on the holiday and I was just like yeah yeah those bastards. I don’t understand how I don’t understand. Because in a lot of ways I am brilliant and then I’m just an idiot. I don’t understand the disconnect in my own brain. I do have ADHD. I do have CPTSD but this isn’t anything new. I’m 45 female, if that’s relevant.  It’s just my life and it’s sooooo frustrating.  My nickname in high school was Astro, as in astronaut. Which is spot on because to be an astronaut you have to be very smart, but you’re also always floating in the air.
Can anyone advise me if I should look into anything or has similar experiences I’d love to hear. Thank you.

Ive had helicobacter, clostridium from the treatment of said helicobacter bcs i forgot to take my probiotics. 
Now, I cant say that I have the best diet, pretty far from it, though i have given up on a lot of junk, i still indulge often. Coffee, milk, choclate occasinal junk food, but its way better than before. 
I first thought that maybe God was trying to help me learn a lesson in body health, fearing less(my problems sometimes give me so much qnxiety it creates them), or just generally trusting Him. But at the same time, I find it extra hard to understand why do I have to go through this. I can't go on trips bcs the fear of a stomach problem is pretty big.
I thought that maybe it has to do with some info I learned recently that might be ""too hard to digest""(personal stuff), but idk.

In hopes of keeping up the good spirit and reaching my goal I am going to do a weekly report, showing my progress (or stagnation) with OMAD.

My main goal with OMAD is loosing some weight, an to remove the temptation of candy, junk food and sodas throughout the day, due to the simplicity of only eating once per day. Getting rid of my sugar addiction will surely be a wonderful thing!  
Other than that I stick to only water and black coffee both while fasting and during my meal.  
I am choosing not to calorie count, but most days I will just eat a large, homecooked meal with my wife and kids. As I am the one who does most of the cooking at home, I have made sure to increase the size of our dinner Meal a little, to make up for the fact that I now eat a bit more at dinnertime than I used to. Probably about once a week, we order takeout, and I assume that will not be a problem either.

**Overall Stats:**  
**Gender:** Male  
**Starting weight:** 110,0 kg  
**Current weight as of this morning:** 97,8 kg  
**Height:** 193 cm  
**Goal:** 90 kg  
**Weeks on OMAD:**  7

**Week 7:**

**End weight:** 97,2 kg  
**Weight loss week 6:**  3, KG

**Monday:** 100,2 kg - 40 minutes of cardio

**Friday:** 98,5 kg - - 40 minutes of cardio  
**Saturday:** ?? kg  
**Sunday:** 97,3 kg  
**Monday:** 97,8 kg

Once again i manage to forget my morning weigh in, saturday morning.

Todays progress report is a day late, as i were on the road most of yesterday picking up a new bike.

Trend is still going down, and i am really starting to see the physical results of my weight loss, both face and body fat has been reduces a lot.

Still feeling amazing with this.

Stay safe out there and hail the one meal god!

But Emma (F24) begged me (M26). Said it would “spice things up,” that we were “too young to be tied down.” I loved her—stupidly, blindly—so I swallowed my pride and agreed. Fine. If it makes you happy.

For months, she went on dates. Came home with smudged lipstick, smelling like someone else’s cologne. I pretended it didn’t gut me. This is what she needs, I told myself. Love means sacrifice.

Then I met Sarah.

It wasn’t even a date. Just coffee with a coworker after a late shift. But we talked for hours—really talked, the way Emma and I hadn’t in years. Sarah laughed at my dumb jokes. Remembered how I took my coffee. Looked at me like I was something precious.

I didn’t mean to fall. But when Emma came home that night, buzzing from some guy’s apartment, I realized: I don’t ache for her anymore.

That’s when Emma noticed.

Suddenly, my phone was “suspicious.” My late nights were “a problem.” She cried when I mentioned Sarah’s name—“You’re supposed to love ME!”—like she hadn’t spent months rubbing her flings in my face.

Last night, she dropped the bomb: “Let’s close the relationship.”

I laughed. I actually laughed. “You don’t get to pull the plug now that I’m the one happy.”

Her face crumpled. “So you’re choosing her?”

I should’ve said yes. But the truth? I’m not choosing Sarah. I’m choosing me. For the first time in years, I’m not begging for scraps of love.

And Emma? She finally understands what it feels like to watch someone walk away

Gave my gf an open relationship to keep her. She played the field; I fell in love. Now she wants to close it, but I’m done.

1jzp07t,https://www.reddit.com/r/brainrot/comments/1jzp07t/whats_wrong_with_my_brain/,What’s wrong with my brain?,"
What’s wrong with my brain? I mixed up the days today. I thought it was Monday and on Monday I thought Sunday. So on Tuesday, thinking it was Monday, I sat down to prepare my case for court the following day, 15.04 (this is importance for later).  This case is an extensive, multi fronted case for my bankruptcy, in which I was self representing vs 9 suits, packed into ½ an hour in court. I needed to be prepared. 
That morning, I spent half an hour interviewing a caregiver for my mother and we spent time discussing how Tuesdays would be optimal and that she could start today. Tuesday! 
We finished the interview, she started her job and I went back to prepping my case. 
I diligently stacked all my papers in piles, made a cup of coffee, took an extra half a dose of my Adderall and began working. 
Silently I look at my phone see a notification from my Google calendar that I am late for a meeting. Now, my Google Calendar has sent me false notifications in the past as if it was a day earlier, so I thought it was one of those. I then double checked the calendar and realized my mistake…
Frantically, I stuff everything from my desk into my bag, my eyes swelling up into tears. I quickly get dressed and hail a cab, while fumbling to find my court invitation to find the address. 
I couldn’t find it, so I just googled the address of the court jumped in a cab. I cried the whole way there, paid an exorbitant amount of money and reach the courthouse with my mind full of explanations to the judge.
The door in the courthouse was locked, I was late for my case and thought maybe they closed. I saw a security guard so I knock on the glass. He opens the door and asks me what I need. I told him I’m late for court court. He says, “ma’am today’s a holiday. To Which I responded, “Yes, I know, they (in my mind-those bastards) scheduled me in for today. I have an invitation.”  He asks me to pull it up. I finally find it, show it to him and say “you see, 15.04”
He looks at it with me and says, just as I realize what he’s about to say; “No ma’am, it says 14.05. Next month.”
…
Silver lining; I’m not late to court!

It’s one thing if it was just messing up the days I could make sense of that because there was a holiday on Sunday so that week started on Monday and I was with my kids and my grandkids and my daughter came from overseas with my grandson. Fine. But I’ve seen the court invitation several times, people told me that it doesn’t make sense that it’s on the holiday and I was just like yeah yeah those bastards. I don’t understand how I don’t understand. Because in a lot of ways I am brilliant and then I’m just an idiot. I don’t understand the disconnect of my own brain. I do have ADHD. I do have CPTSD but this isn’t anything new. I’m 45 female if that’s relevant.  It’s just my life and it’s sooooo frustrating.  My nickname in high school was Astro, as an astronaut. Which is spot on because to be an astronaut you have to be very smart, but you’re also always floating in the air.
Can anyone advise me of I should look into anything of has similar experiences I’d love to hear. Thank you.

He nicknames her freckles because after the wedding when she takes the makeup off, he finds that she has freckles.

He goes away on a business trip and when he comes back, he sees her in a coffee shop with one of her colleagues, and he gets jealous.

She leaves him (don’t remember why). He goes to look for her, in her hometown. She’s hanging out with her two best friends, one girl and one guy the guys in love with her and at one point her guy best friend wasn’t speaking to her because she left without telling them what was going on if I’m not mistaken.

She finds out that the ring he gave her belongs to the other woman. He buys her a ring for every day of the month. She also spends her own money to buy him a custom ring, her grandfather dies, and while grieving he leaves because he finds out his grandfather, has cancer, but because his grandmother was helping her deal with her grandfather‘s death, the grandfather didn’t want the grandmother to know. She misunderstand the situation thinking that he’s with the other woman who schemes to make it look like they were together again she disappears, finds out she’s pregnant and goes through pregnancy without him.

Finally, she uses the card that he gave her to pay for her medical bills after having the twins. This is how he finds her again.

I am asking this question because I just want to know how others are splitting bills and then to also take a look at myself I suppose. 
I make 25k working as a receptionist and struggling to get a better job that pays well. My partner makes 37k and his salary will be going up, he has a stable career. He works a lot of overtime to make more money as well. 
My husband pays for all the bills, I moved into his flat. He pays for most of the groceries. I pay for some groceries and pay for electricity..he pays for electricity as well here and there. Im taking driving lessons weekly and pay 51£ for half and half. Also I'm studying accounting which im paying 60£ monthly for. I pay for my other personal expenses as well. I seem to run out of money as well. I save away money for both of us towards our first home. I put away 400£ and set aside 100£ for electric.  My husband told me that he sends his mom money every month. She lives in the uk as well and has a working son living with her who pays for all the groceries and her partner pays for all the bills. Her asking for money from my husband seems to make us struggle but he said its fine since his pay will be going up. This bothered me quite a bit because yh fair enough he can send her money if she really needs it...but sometimes when she runs out of money she asks my husband. My husband has an older brother and he's also married with 2 kids and never sends my mil money and never has either. Idk if I should be bothered or is this actually my fault because I need to contribute more or something. My partner works a lot aswell. We don't go on weekly dates or anything either. We've been married for slightly over a year now and I might be pregnant as well need to test after next week. Husband said he's OK paying all the bills when I first moved in with him. I guess it's a cultural thing to pay for everything as man. I don't make enough though and it's such a struggle finding a good job. I've been trying and failing.  I mostly do the cooking at home. 
I want to know everyone else's opinion. 
I asked my husband out for a meal today which I'll pay for on Thursday. My husband also mentioned last time that he never really spends.on himself when i asked about the situation with him sending his mum money. Before we got married he would send her 150 a month.not sure how.much right now..he sent her 40 this week for her knee pain acupuncture..he seemed abit hesitant but sent it anyway and that day we went out for a coffee instead rather than for a meal. He told me the night.before we should save.and might need the money. I was ok with it and then next day he sends.his mom 40 for her knee issue.

I know alot of people will probably tell me to create a joint account with partner...i mentioned joint account in the past and his credit score is bad and also i think i spend more and earning less so if im honest..i.dont really wanna do that. I understand being married its together. I also do save away money for myself just incase in the future if anything happens. ",3,1744714212.0,Marriage,26,1.0,False

Edit: 
Question: what legal defence do I have in this situation

What legal allegations could I have from the sister in law and brother.

What has the sister in law done illegally

If I go down so does my brother, that’s the nature of his abuse. Followed by, I don’t want the sister in law too get away with nothing after she ignores continual demands for the land owner.


The first incident of the day:

The land owner/mum moved a coffee machine. 
Sister in law and brother came home, verbally abused mum.

 
Mum had carried a coffee machine downstairs into the garage, my brother carried it back up while the sister in law was verbally abusing my mother.
Sis in-law and brother leave
They told not to come back


The second incident of the day: brother bashed on the door near 5-6pm, mum answered. Mum was then strangled against a wall then released by my brother, they made their way upstairs where they kicked over a low sitting coffee table, as-well as threw a rice cooker hard enough against carpet to break and bend the metal inside.

Mum then called for me telling me “he strangled me stop him” where my brother and I wrestled untill my brother did not continue to break things and it continued to last in a verbal argument between my brother and mother. 


Sister in law then came upstairs to remove my brother. After a short while they were out the door. Realising they had dropped a phone, my mother found it and went to give back the phone, while recording with her own.

For Speculation reasons i don’t know what was in the video recording I won’t say anything was on it, however when my mother pened the door person they had realised that she was recording and burst through the door and demanded her phone to delete the video, this was when mum was on the stairs with them below. They had deleted what was in the phone and proceeded to attempt, to verbally abuse and physically make their way upstairs where mum said if you don’t leave I will kick you down the stairs, they continued, i then got up from another room and forced, pushed, rugby scrum style (pushed with biceps) down the stairs away from my mother. This was about 3-4 steps so about 30 centimetres in high.

Sister in law suffered an abrasion on the knuckle and a bruise on the neck 

(Don’t know how to bruise got their same as the knuckle)

2nd day:

They came to the house, after the events have unfolded, entered the house without permission approached mum while they were sleeping and told mum to leave. Mum left, went to the police station to check for statements and left.
My brother/the sister in law not sure who, followed my brother before returning 


They are now, with evidence proving they are doing this, with them verbally admitting in the act, that they are holding an assault charge over me and attempting to blackmail and extort my mother and I. Their is video evidence from i, when i was inside of my own bedroom.
What do they want, who knows. Some form of gratification. 


Day 4: 
They return, verbally Abuse mum, and leave
They come back later in the afternoon, abuse mum and leave.


The relations

Person 1 mother
Person 2 sister in law
Person 3 older brother (married)
Person 4 younger son


Notes to add.
My brother has a long previous history with abuse against his partner
My mother has previously been put under duress and as of today signed that she had done so by the couple 


(This has been happening since the dawn of time)


The couple both have this tendency where if they can’t yell at you in the phone they will ether call it (I say this literally) 20-30 times followed or in combination with 10-15 messages.


This has been my Ted talk
Sorry I think this is a bit more of a letting out what happened because it’s unfair on my mother, I am sorry that the sister in law got hurt but, had no intentions of doing so. I was just trying to protect my mother.


I’ll be back to edit and read any advice
I hate hurting women I always have hated the act if i did hurt her, I will try to do better in the future.

The NCLEX was supposed to be my victory lap after years of nursing school, but when I saw ""fail"" on my results after my first attempt in mid 2024, it felt like the ground crumbled beneath me. I’d studied hard, sacrificed sleep, and aced practice tests, yet I fell short. The disappointment stung, but I refused to let it define me. 

After failing, I spent a few days wallowing, questioning if nursing was even for me. The Next Gen NCLEX’s case studies and tricky select-all-that-apply questions had thrown me off. My confidence was shaken, but I knew giving up wasn’t an option. I decided to treat failure as feedback. I requested my Candidate Performance Report and saw my weak spots;
pharmacology and priority-setting questions. That was my starting point.

Step 1: Reframing My Mindset
The first hurdle was mental. I stopped seeing the NCLEX as a monster to slay and started viewing it as a puzzle to solve. I journaled my fears,imposter syndrome, time pressure, and countered them with affirmations like, “I’ve handled tough clinicals; I can handle this.” I also connected with a study group in nursing,  where others shared their own NCLEX struggles. Knowing I wasn’t alone fueled my motivation.

Step 2: A Smarter Study Plan
My first attempt relied on cramming and endless flashcards, which didn’t stick. This time, I built a structured 8-week plan. I used a mix of resources:  
Naxlex for realistic practice questions, focusing on my weak areas. I read every rationale, even for correct answers.  
Simple Nursing videos for pharmacology; those catchy mnemonics helped me finally remember drug classes.

I studied 3–4 hours daily, breaking it into chunks: morning for content review, afternoon for practice questions (50–85 per session), and evening for analyzing mistakes. I prioritized active learning, teaching concepts to my study buddy or quizzing myself during walks. To tackle priority setting, I practiced the ABCs (airway, breathing, circulation) and Maslow’s hierarchy until they were second nature.

Step 3: Adapting to Next Gen NCLEX
The Next Gen NCLEX’s case studies had tripped me up before. This time, I leaned into them. I practiced unfolding scenarios; learning to spot key data in patient charts and anticipate what the question was really asking. I used online resources like Naxlex Review’s case study bank, which helped me get comfortable with formats like drag-and-drop and highlight questions. I also timed myself to build stamina for the 5-hour exam.

Step 4: Self-Care and Simulation
Burnout was a risk, so I scheduled downtime yoga, sleep, or coffee with friends to recharge. I also simulated test day: I took full-length practice exams in a quiet library, with earplugs and a timer, to mimic the Pearson VUE environment. This reduced my anxiety about the real thing. A week before the test, I reviewed my “cheat sheet” of must-knows (lab values, delegation rules) and then trusted my preparation.

The Triumph: Passing with Flying Colors
On test day in early  2025 I walked into the testing center nervous but prepared. The exam felt tough—150 questions, with lots of case studies—but I stayed calm, using strategies like eliminating wrong answers and pacing myself. When it shut off, I was cautiously hopeful. Two days later, I checked the Quick Results: PASS. I cried tears of joy, knowing I’d not only passed but mastered content I once struggled with.

Failing the NCLEX taught me resilience. It forced me to confront my weaknesses, refine my approach, and trust my ability to grow. My biggest takeaways? Failure isn’t final—it’s a detour. Study smarter, not just harder. Now, as a licensed RN, I’m proud not just of passing, but of the grit it took to get here.",22,1744714030.0,NCLEXsuccessStories,21,1.0,False

1jzooan,https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/1jzooan/first_road_bike_advice/,First road bike advice,"M(42) I’ve been riding off road for many years. Mostly 2 stroke enduro machines.

I recently got my first licence and as part of this I had to do some rider training which I really enjoyed as it was mostly country roads and an instructor doing an appraisal of ability to ride the bike. The bikes were unrestricted 700c naked uprights.

I had initially thought that I might get an adventure bike of some sort, I wasn’t too excited on getting a bike for the street. After the training I realised how much I enjoyed road biking on a sunny day. I’ve never wanted a sports bike up to now. I don’t have the use for one. Litre bikes are just too fast, I had never intended to get one and ride one to its limits that was until I did my rider training. I’m now wondering should I just buy a Panigale and be done. I’ve always lusted after a red Ducati as an ornament. Now I think I could have one to ride on the odd sunny day and to look at while drinking coffee the other days.

I have many many hours of off road riding done but I have a fear of powerful litre bikes in my head.

I’m not afraid of speed per se. I have several cars ranging from 300 to 500hp and regularly use all of that power. 

I am afraid however of the consequences of having a wreck on a motorbike. Death, life changing injuries etc.

Is a panigale a terrible idea, should I forget about it and look at a comfortable upright option adventure bike, dual sport, cruiser/hog style machine which will have all the power and handling capabilities that I need for my use case or is the Panigale a good fit for the odd spin where I do not intend to ride fast? Is the panigale too peaky a bike for relaxed riding? Should I just look for a torquey machine?

After riding a 700cc I’m no longer afraid of my abilities or of sudden whiskey throttle incidents, not that I’m an expert but I feel competent enough. But are there other things that I’m missing, will a panigale be miserable for a relaxed ride in the countryside? Note I’m not interested in a gixxer, cbr, vfr etc.

Poor honey was saying he slept really poorly, which I hate for him, but I still feel happy he messaged me :) and I got a smiley face! Even if it was a sad one. My poor baby. 

I slept okay. I woke up a lot and was awake from around 7 and *once again* I did not learn my lesson and just get up then, I thought hey I know let’s forget my regret from the other day and do it again! WHY AM I SO FRUSTRATING? Anyway. 

I know I still have the bruising on my elbow crook but because I saw it in the corner of my eye but I can’t look at it, I was literally sick with anxiety when I took the bandaid off of it last night like my anxiety just FLOODED me I was shaking and bent over the bathroom sink and just feeling panicked. It’s hard to explain the immediate shift. Anyway it’s kind of pinky red which is why I am freaked but okay I’mWriting this and tensing the f up so I med to stop. 

I made a coffee in my machine and it was yum :) 

MY UPGRADE WORKED! No issues! (Thus far). WHAT A RELIEF. Phewf. I have to google how to turn my iPhone on and off but I managed and authorised a whole system upgrade in our IT platform - hell yeah babyyyyy. And I did the whole thing, I had two guys from work “helping” and they’re big senior IT guys and they didn’t even do anything it was alllllll me. Well me and the external provider woman who was a godsend and answered all my questions, I thanked her and her team member profusely. Anyway, yay. 

I’ve noticed if I quietly hum to myself it helps me feel less anxy. I did that yesterday, I was walking to the GP and I just felt so unbelievably unwell with everything and so I was just humming a random little tune under my breath - no one was around other than noisy cars so i didn’t sound crazy - and it helped. It’s like the writhing ankle/foot thing, it focuses my attention on something even just a fraction and comes with a physical feeling so it helps to redirect my internal panic. I would never self harm but for I understand why people do I think, like when the depression physically aches and is so inescapable and you just need to redirect the feeling elsewhere? Like I get it. I won’t ever do it and never really have but I get it. I don’t condone it but I get it, yknow? Anyway. Humming helped a bit. 

My blood test and swab results came back already. As expected, no STI - I mean I could have bet my life on that outcome but guess it’s now scientifically confirmed too. All my blood levels are good and within range, though my ferritin and iron are decidedly low - surprise surprise. But still within range! So I’m still doing well to keep them up. I also then got them all translated with comments by chat gpt because why not and it said I was very good! I realise it’s a lil robot not a doctor so I take it with a teeny tiny incy wincy grain of salt, but yay all the same. 

That whole space tourist trip those women just did seems so… stupid? Disappointing? But expected? I mean the comment about protecting “Mother Earth” and realising how important earth is? As if you couldn’t work that out while being on earth? I mean.. like lady you just went on a trip that spewed idk how many tonnes of air pollution but okay. It just feels gross. The amount of money that would have gone into it… and all the issues it could have helped address. Like seriously how many resources went into putting them all up there for what, ten minutes. It’s so… well I mean it’s exactly what you expect of celebrities and just people nowadays, isn’t it? I’m not some sort of saint so I don’t mean to compare and that’s not what I’m doing, I’m evidently just rambling on and on but I just read an article or two about the trip and it yucked me out. I just don’t get how any of it is worthwhile? It just seems so disconnected from reality. 

Idk where it came from because I didn’t listen to it but that bop bop bop bop to the top song from
HSM won’t get out of my head. 

I listened to it, it’s just made it worse. 

I hate how unwell he’s feeling. My poor sweet honeybunny. I wish it would just go away so he could feel better. On a selfish level, his little emoji faces make me feel less… idk. It’s weird, it’s such a TINY nothing thing but the fact he includes a ‘:(‘ somehow makes him feel less distant? Is that ridiculous? Obviously. In all honesty though, I’d rather he feel okay and me worry about his distance, I just want him to be okay. I want it so much. I feel so much frustration that I can’t do anything. 

I ended up working til around 7:30-ish. Kinda making up for feeling/being slack yesterday. 

I really want to try go to the office this week. I am aiming for Thursday. You can do ittttttttttt. 

It’s kind of cool how English and just words in all languages I suppose but how they derive from Latin or Greek etc. Like to see the influence I mean. I was in the shower just not for example and was reading the ingredients of my cleanser and for example sunflower seed oil is helianthus and Helios was the sun god and also Greek for sun, and then anthos is Greek for flower! SUN-FLOWER. Well it’s helianthus annus, but then I thought annus was Latin so idk. I say all this - I know nothing about linguistics but just when you see little common known things like that is fun, no? I feel like the old dad in my big fat Greek wedding. BUT HES ON TO SOMETHING. And then how there’s a myth! I only just learned it now, twenty million trillion dollars I forget it by tomorrow as I just find it so hard to remember the stories or more rather the names etc anyway of Clytie who fell in love with Helios and he turned her into a sunflower and sunflowers always follow the direction of the sun because she loved him :) but then I read it was APOLLO not Helios and then that it was Zeus and I mean this is another reason why I find it hard to learn, there’s so many variations! But tbh it’s just fun reading about them and the stories and then if I forget I forget, I’m not studying it for a test now am I? I just love Greek mythology. Well all mythology, but Greek is typically the gateway and I’m still at gateway level. I remember going to a museum/place in Bali and listening to a story about (I had to google to remember their names) Garuda and Vishnu and even then part of the story was about these creatures called nagas and I read a book/series where they were a monster of sorts in it! It’s so fun catching all the links and things to myths and whatnot. I’m wording this so badly but anyway. I wish I was smarter so I could properly learn and understand linguistics, I find it so interesting. Maybe I should find a book about it… a kids book about it, let’s be for real. Buuuuut we all have to start somewhere. 

I miss him. My honey. My baby. My man ❤️ it’s his birthday soonish… idk if I should make him a card and things or not? I mean I will but what if he ends things with me?? I won’t do proper presents or anything, just something little like a gesture. And that liquorice seeing as he always wants it. A little parcel. Hm. 

Sometimes I wish I would think before I tell him things. Well actually I did, but AFTER I told him I was playing jigsaw puzzle games on my phone. However I stopped myself telling him I was playing it while watching videos of cross country train tours so I mean, a small win… but seriously, these are the things you share when you can counteract that with a bj or something to make it less.. yknow. I mean you don’t associate puzzles with girls you fancy, do you? I mean I’m not a hot girl, that’s a fact of life, but yknow what I mean. 

I get to babysit puppy tomorrow afternoon. I’m so excited. I love my little darling boy so much. Sweet baby angel.

I’ve been trying to build a solid study routine that actually sticks — not just a burst of motivation that fades in a few days. So I thought it’d be great if we could all share some tips, small habits, or tricks that help us stay focused and consistent.
Here are a few things that have helped me so far:

 Simple to-do list (night before): Keeps my brain from starting the day in chaos mode.

Lo-fi beats or rain sounds: Instant focus zone — seriously, they work like magic.

Phone on airplane mode: The fewer pings, the fewer distractions.

 And now a little bit weird hacks for you:

 Low-Energy Menu: I keep a list of tiny, low-effort tasks (like organizing notes or reviewing flashcards) for days when I’ve got zero energy. Still feels productive.

Environmental anchors: I use the same scented candle or hoodie only when studying — it tricks my brain into study mode.

Special drink ritual: I treat myself to one specific drink (hello, iced coffee) only during study sessions. It gives me something to look forward to.

 Study = Reset Button: Before I sit down, I do a tiny physical reset — wash my face, stretch, or change clothes. It helps signal that I’m shifting into focus mode.

 The 3-Task Rule: I limit each study session to just 3 tasks. It keeps things doable and prevents overwhelm from those never-ending to-do lists.


That’s what’s been working for me — but I’m always on the lookout for new ideas!

This is probably the greatest time of year to visit the National Park and see tigers and other wildlife. The intense heat of these months pushes animals toward sources of water, making them easier to locate close to them. The safari can see clearly because the sky are clear during these months.

I’m super excited (and mildly panicking) to share that I’ve been accepted into King’s for the MA in Public Policy starting this September! 

Would love to connect with:

-> Current students in the program (Would genuinely appreciate any honest takes, from coursework to coffee recommendations)

-> Fellow offer-holders (Let’s be overwhelmed together. 


Also, I’d love some help navigating accommodation. King’s has quite a few options and I have no idea what’s good vs what’ll make me question life choices. So if anyone can share where they’re staying / stayed, I’d really appreciate it.

Is there a WhatsApp group (or any group chat) for incoming students in this program? Would be great to join and start connecting before term begins.

Any advice, survival hacks, or even small things I should know about being at King’s / living in London, hit me up. Open to everything!

Thanks in advance!
Khushal

\*\*Stick a prompt in it.\*\*







\---



I tried to find this.  



But instead, I got a hundred productivity startups doing spiritual cosplay with the copy/paste workflow — for $29/month.



""Is there a way to organize my own thoughts without signing up for a kombucha brand?"" I wondered.



I came to paste a sentence, not unpack my \*inner creative blocks\*.  

(What the hell \*is\* an inner creative block?)



So here it is:  

\*\*Buttonhole.\*\*  

A button.  

That holds a prompt.



No cloud. No login. No telemetry.  

No integrations with tools I don't use.  

No onboarding video narrated by a guy named Lucas in a recycled sweater.



Just a side panel in VS Code.  

Click a prompt → it copies.  

Paste it where you need it. 

That's the whole feature set.



\---



\## What it does



\- Shows a panel of buttons for your prompts

\- Click = copied

\- Add/edit/remove prompts in the UI

\- Toggle them on/off

\- Share your full deck with one click (you've done this before...)

\- Stores everything in 1998 \`prompts.json\`



\---



\## What it doesn't do



\- Sync to the cloud  

\- Inspire you  

\- Send a monthly usage digest  

\- Recommend a new GPT for ""enhanced synergy""  

\- Ask you to pick a color palette for your ""creativity zone""

\- Oh dam, i did add that



\---



\## How to know it's not for you



\- You're still pretending Notion is a dev tool  

\- You've ever described yourself as a ""Prompt Strategist""  

\- You'd pay a SaaS to manage your other SaaS



\---



\##  Price  

\*\*$5. One time. That's it.\*\*



There's no DRM. No checkout flow.  

No data server calling home.  

If it helps, throw five bucks at \[Buy Me a Coffee\](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nullprompt).



If you don't? Hey I get it. Times are weird.  

But if you steal it and use it every day?



I'll know.

You'll know.

And you will feel it.



\> \*\*In your buttonhole.\*\*



\---



\## How to use it



1. \`Ctrl+Alt+P\` or run ""Buttonhole: Open Prompt Panel""

2. Click a prompt

3. Paste it

4. Go back to doing actual work



\*\*To install:\*\*



\- Download \`buttonhole-1.0.0.vsix\`  

\- In VS Code: \`Ctrl+Shift+P\` → Install from VSIX → Done



\---



\## Final thought



No growth strategy.  

No Discord. No roadmap. No promises.  

No dreams.



Change the name.  

Swap the colors.  

Share it with a friend.



Just don't build a startup on top of it.

Because there isn't one there.  

\*\*We've all suffered enough.\*\*

cuffed behind her back. Her hair is out of place. 

Her olive tank top is only half tucked into her black 

jeans now after the scuffle we had when **I** finally

put–together she still looks after the scuffle we had. 

I finally found her. 

I don’t say anything, though. Ijust smile softly. I

applauding officers, whistling and throwing scathing 

remarks at the arrested woman.

evening?” Jim asks me.

ok?”

a big conference in the city, and all of the police 

force are required to go, even me. 

But sometimes, work comes first. Like tonight. 

It smells like… old coffee and dust in here. The

sense of barely contained chaos in the stacks of 

paperwork on the desks and the overflowing garbage

I was at a used bookstore earlier and I was in an aisle looking at some books and a nice looking girl was about 10 feet away from me, then she walked like literally RIGHT next to me and started looking at the same books I was, and in my head I was yelling at myself to start a conversation with her (we exchanged smiles a little earlier) but then she just walked away after a little bit.

Then, later in the day, I had the perfect opportunity to talk to my gym crush who I’ve been wanting to talk to for about a month or so. We’ve been catching each other look at each other for a while and I was hyping myself up all weekend saying the next time I see her I’m gonna go up to her and introduce myself, then ask if she’s interested in lunch or coffee. And I had the perfect opportunity because she got on the stairmaster near mine and we got off around the same time. We were leaving the gym around the same time, that was the perfect opportunity. Instead I acted like a scared little sissy and just walked to my car without saying a word.

I’m not gonna sugarcoat it, I fucking hate myself right now. I have mild social anxiety, and I’ve been reading a self help book with managing social anxiety. I was doing much better in terms of walking confidently and feeling confident, but approaching and talking to girls has always been my weakest point. I thought with the extra confidence I was giving myself, it was finally time to overcome it. 

But of course not. I’m still acting like a scared little sissy in the same way I’ve been since high school. It’s so frustrating to know the perfect opportunity to talk and start a conversation, but your body just pulls away and refuses to let it happen. I feel like all the progress I’ve made in terms of feeling confident has just gone down the drain. I haven’t felt this defeated or low in a long time, and it sucks.
