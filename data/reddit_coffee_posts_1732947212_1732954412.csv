1h37vha,https://www.reddit.com/r/HairTransplants/comments/1h37vha/hair_transplant_at_dht_clinic_bangkok_with_dr/,Hair Transplant at DHT Clinic Bangkok with Dr. Pathomvanich (Dr. Path) My Journey & AMA,"I just had a hair transplant at DHT Clinic in Bangkok with Dr. Path on November 29. 2024

I booked the surgery 8 months in advance because I knew I would be coming to Thailand for a few months around this time.

A little bit about myself. I'm a 34-year-old caucasian male with average hair genetics.

There are 2 areas that I wanted to address:- hairline (mainly filling out the corners and also, my hairline was a little bit higher on the right side and lower on the left side, so I wanted to balance it out).

My hairline has been the same as far as I can remember. Probably since my early 20s or even late teens. Not great, but not horrible.- a crown (this is what bothered me the most and made me start considering a hair transplant).

My crown started thinning in my late 20s (classic scenario), and I lost a lot of ground around the age of 27-29. 

When I started noticing the crown thinning, I started doing PRP (twice a year). That was probably around 2018, and then in 2020, I added topical Minoxidil (Rogaine foam - 2x a day).

That helped a lot and my hair loss stopped and I even saw some regrowth (probably 10-15% improvement).

But it didn't change the fact that my hair was not getting any better. My biggest regret was not starting finasteride in my late 20s when I started noticing the thinning crown. 

But I just had no idea that something like that existed, and I was trying to convince myself to start using Minoxidil at that time. 

Anyway, HT was something that I decided to do a year ago, but I didn't book it in advance, and the surgeons that I talked to were not available during my time in SE Asia.

**So book your HT in advance!**

I contacted 4 different HT surgeons before deciding to go with Dr. Path, and I'm extremely happy that I went with him.

**Here are the clinics that I consulted:**

* DHT Clinic Bangkok - Dr. Path
* Absolute Hair Clinic - Dr. Laorwong
* HairTran Clinic - Dr. Patty
* Hasson & Wong

**DHT Clinic Bangkok - Dr. Path**

Great communication from the get-go. Dr. Path was very specific in his emails, and he would almost always get back to me within 24 hours.

We discussed different strategies for my case because I needed a larger amount of grafts to address the hairline and crown during one surgery, and he didn't want to deplete the donor area to cause diffusing thinning and leave some for potential future transplants.

He also asked me to send him pictures of wet hair and combed a certain way to give me a better assessment.

My crown looks not so bad with dry hair and very bad with wet hair.

He offered me 3 options: FUE, FUT and a FUE + FUT combo.

I was only interested in FUE, so he mentioned that we can use my beard as a secondary donor area if my donor density is not high enough.

He charges 123 THB per graft. (FUE)

FUT is a bit cheaper. He estimated 1800 for the hairline and 2500 for the crown.

**Absolute Hair Clinic - Dr. Laorwong**

I was strongly considering Dr. Laorwon because I've read lots of great things about him on Reddit, HairTransplantNetworks and YouTube.

I sent him an email, and he replied within a couple of days. He gave me a brief reply with not as many specifics as Dr. Path.

He estimated 1200-1400 grafts for the hairline and 1800-2000 grafts for the crown.

And quoted me 80 BTH per graft (this was October 2023).

I know he is one of the best HT surgeons in the world and I think he's an excellent choice and you can't go wrong with them.

I also like how much aftercare they provide at their clinic. Top notch!

He's super popular these days and you need to book well in advance.

He was also trained under Dr. Path, so the quality will be excellent.

The only detergent for me was the lack of communication.

He's very to the point, but I'm kind of a person who has lots of questions, cannot shut my head, and I just like personal approach and being able to get specific options for my case in advance.

That's ultimately why I decided to go with Dr. Path, but it was between Dr. P and Dr. L.I

Also, I liked Dr. Path's plan B, which was to use my beard as a secondary donor area in case my hair density wasn't high enough in my donor area.

**HairTrain - Dr. Patty**

Very fast and detailed email response. However, it was not a good fit for my case as Dr. Patty wanted to do the hairline first and then she advised me to start taking Finestride to see how it can improve the crown and come back in a year for a second HT.

This is actually a very smart approach, but we are trying to have a baby, and I cannot/don't want to be on Finestride around this time. Once we get pregnant, I will start taking Fin (more on this later). But it wasn't a good fit for my case.

I also preferred Dr. Path's hairline and since I needed a high number of grafts I wanted to go with the most experience surgeon I could find.

If it was only hairline and if budget is your concern, it's probably;t hard to beat Dr. Patty.

This is her quote: *The price for a shave FUE hair transplant (scalp donor) 3500 grafts is 134,000 THB. For any extra grafts, the price will be 35 THB/graft (1500-2000 grafts = 88,000THB/ 2000-2500 grafts = 99,000THB)*

She estimated 1500 for the headline and 2500 for the crown. 

**Hasson & Wong**

I contacted this clinic because I live in Vancouver, BC - that's where they are located.

They estimated 1500 grafts for the hairline and 2000-2500 for the crown.

They wanted to do 2 surgeries a few weeks apart. (prices are in CAD, not USD)

Pricing: 

*Our fee schedule is $8.00 per graft for the first 2000 grafts and $6.00 for each graft above 2,000 plus a 5% tax. (These are from September 2023).*

I was contacted by their consultant, Chris, and he answered my question, it was to the point, but I had a feeling that I was just another number for them.

They were not very companioned. Dismissed the use of Minoxidil even though it's something that's been helping me a ton. Misspelled my first name in the very first email. And pushed their product XYON.

I didn't like the vibe and the fact that lots of healthcare in North America is primarily about money.

I work for a healthcare digital marketing agency (for over 10 years) and I deal with dentists and plastic surgeons on a daily basis so I have a fair share of experience with how some of them are. Most of them are great people and care about patients more than anything, like my physio or RMT in Canada (I couldn't ask for better people).

But some are very business oriented and you won't get the same level of care and attention as you will get in Asia for example.

**Now to the Surgery**

I had a pre-op consultation one day prior to surgery. It took around 1hr a 15 mins.

One of the doctors who work with Dr. Path went through my hair loss history, medical history, medications that I'm on and all that kind of stuff. She was super kind and knowledgeable and spoke excellent English.

She then measured hair density in my donor area, which was quite high (above average). I think it was 92 or 94 per sq cm (one of those numbers), and Dr. Path later told me that his patients have the average hair density around 75 per sq cm.

After that I met with Dr. Path and the rest of the team and he started drawing the hairline with feedback from me, my wife, and the rest of his team.

Once we were settled on the hairline they started counting the number of grafts I'm gonna need. 

**1850 for the hairline**

**2100 for the crown**

Because the estimated number of grafts required was lower than initially anticipated and the donor zone density was higher than we thought it would be, we decided not to use beard grafts for the crown and only scalp grafts.

They also took my blood to test for HIV and Hep C (900 THB).

They gave me a small bottle of antiseptic shampoo to wash my hair with when I got home.

I was a bit scared of erasing the hairline that Dr. Path drew but did a decent job washing my hair and not erasing it.

I slept pretty well, and I wasn't very nervous because I had a very good feeling after the pre-op consultation.

On the day of the surgery, I had a light breakfast and a few sips of coffee. The pre-op instructions mention not drinking coffee or tea, but the doctor told me it's more of people who get hyped on coffee.

If you're a regular coffee drinker, you can have a cup. I usually have 3 cups a day and 2 scoops of pre-workout, so I have a high caffeine tolerance and can literally fall asleep after drinking coffee at night, lol. (trying to cut back on this!).

I arrived at the clinic at 9 am. I'm staying at a Craftsman hotel, which is only 700m away (10 min walk) from the clinic. I checked in at the reception, and they asked me what I wanted for the launch.

When I asked what the options were, they told me anything I wanted, they would get for me. Burger, sandwich, wrap, Pad Thai or any other Thai food.

I went with chicken Pad Thai because I wanted something not so heavy and because it's one of my al time favourite Thai food.

Then I went to the pre-op room, where they measured my blood pressure; we revised the hairline once again because one of the nurses mentioned that the right side was a tiny bit lower, and we all agreed.

Then came the fun part, which was shaving my head. I was somewhat curious about how I would look bold, haha.

One more thing. I have (well had) 3 smaller moles on my head. Dr. Path said that they usually shave them off during the surgery and only send them to the lab if they look suspicious. Being an overthinker and wanting to be on the safer side, I asked to send all 3 of them to the lab for testing, which they said was not a problem and would do it for me. They also gave me antibiotics and 4 sleeping pills. I started feeling pretty sleepy after 30 mins.

They then took me to the operating room, where the whole team was already waiting for me.

**Just a quick note to the pain level.**

And I am not a super tough guide by any means, but I have a somewhat higher pain threshold. But the pain level during the surgery was 1/10 like, seriously.

At any point, I didn't feel any pain. If you guys have ever done PRP, these injections hurt more.

What was killing me was lying flat on my belly for 4 hours. That's the toughest part of the hair transplant. I fell asleep, woke up and started freeing out because I had a dream that I was still at home and overslept the surgery (I had the same dream before, haha).

And then my arm was going numb from lying on it but then I figured out an angle at which it srtaed feeling better.

You can ask for a break anytime you want, but I didn't want to disrupt Dr. Path from the rhythm.

As far as I know, he was doing all of the extractions by himself.I don't remember exactly what time the surgery itself started, but I took a quick bathroom break around 2 pm (I was sleeping most of the time before that because of the 4 sleeping pills that I took).

They have a fridge filled with drinks that you can grab anything from, and even though it's a small thing, drinking a pomegranate juice and Coke Zero felt like heaven and brought life back into me.

Then back to the table!

The graft extraction probably took the longest time, and it felt like a slight pulling. 0 pain.

4:15 pm and lunch break time. I was so excited about finally taking a longer break, eating my first meal after breakfast, and chilling for a bit. The Pad Thai tasted out of this world. They also asked me if I wanted any fruits and brought me some pineapple and bananas.

After the lunch break, back to the table. Dr. Path started making the incisions. I remember him working on the hairline but not on the crown because I fell asleep for a couple of hours.

Oh, I forgot to mention I did bring my earbuds and phone and I was planning on listening to some podcasts and stuff but I was just too sleepy to focus on that so the earbuds functioned more as earplugs until I had to lie down on my side and they started falling out of my ears haha.

After the incisions were done, I took another bathroom break and had another juice or coke (I don't remember), but the whole team was super cool, and they even let me use the microscope and look at my grafts and everything. They even took pictures of my using the microscope. The last phase was inserting the grafts into the sites.

This was done mostly by the assistants, but Dr. Path was there most of the time supervising, checking, and talking to them. I took my last break around 9:30 pm, and they told me that there were only 800 grafts left to be put in place. I was somewhat relieved but hungry and thirsty.

I attacked another banana, and when one of the nurses saw me, she asked me if I wanted to get an iced coffee.

Hell yeah! She brought me a fresh iced coffee, which made me feel amazing.

I knew I was close, and I could do one more hours.

You can tell that even though Dr. Path has already made a name for himself and has probably nothing to prove to anyone, he still genuinely cares about his patients and coworkers, and the whole team is having fun. They were cracking jokes here are there and laughing which I really appreciated because I was there until 10:30 pm from 9 am!

I am not the best at taking pictures but did my best.

The Reddit community and stories helped me a ton when learning about hair restoration, choosing a surgeon, learning questions to ask etc. and I just want to give back.

If you have any questions, post them below, and I will do my best to answer all of them.

I'm in BKK for the next week and gotta take it easy for the next few days.

If you have any personal questions that you don't wanna share here, send me a DM, and I will do my best to help.

**For people who want more specifics:**

* 1 hair = 374
* 1 & 1/2 hair = 310
* 2 hairs = 2121
* 3 hairs = 1153
* 4 hairs = 142 (one of the doctors told me that's the highest his year)

**Total: 4125 grafts**

**Total: 8953 hairs**

**Front 1910 grafts**

**Crown: 2215 grafts**

They even showed me how many of each hair is on which side of the hairline and crown and a very detailed breakdown (I took a picture). But that's probably an overkill to share.

*\*Edit: I just returned from my first check-up, hair wash, and LLLT. Dr. Path inspected the transplanted area, and the nurse removed the dressing, gave me a surgical cap, washed my hair, showed me how to do it at home and told me to come back on Monday (they are closed on Sunday) for another round of hair wash and LLLT.*

*Disclaimer: This is just my personal story. I am not a doctor, and I am not telling you to do something or not to do something. Do your research, talk to your healthcare professional, consult a few hair transplant surgeons and make the best decision for yourself.  We all have different stories and personal goals.*

Much love,

Tomas

1h37qo8,https://www.reddit.com/r/clickfunnels_ai/comments/1h37qo8/clickfunnels_meets_kiyosaki_transform_your_side/,ClickFunnels Meets Kiyosaki: Transform Your Side Hustle into a Business Asset,"In Robert Kiyosaki’s [Cashflow Quadrant](https://amzn.to/4f27qwo), the ultimate goal is to transition from being an Employee (E) or Self-Employed (S) to becoming a Business Owner (B) or an Investor (I). A ClickFunnels sales funnel is a tool that can help you make this transition, turning your business into a scalable and automated system. But how can a digital tool like ClickFunnels fit into Kiyosaki’s framework and help you build a robust asset?

Let’s dive into the practical aspects of building your sales funnel as a long-term asset, enriched with real-world examples and insights from experts like Dan Kennedy, Alex Hormozi, and Russell Brunson.

# Step 1: Reframe Your Perspective—A Funnel is a Business System

In Kiyosaki’s terms, a sales funnel represents the core of a *Business Quadrant* asset. It doesn’t just generate leads; it creates a replicable system for acquiring customers. Unlike an employee who works for wages or a self-employed professional who trades hours for dollars, a funnel works around the clock, freeing up your time to focus on strategy or other ventures.

# Real-Life Analogy:

Think of a coffee shop. Without systems for sourcing beans, making coffee, and attracting customers, the owner is stuck doing everything themselves. A sales funnel automates the digital equivalent: attracting customers (traffic), converting them into buyers, and encouraging repeat purchases, just like a well-run coffee shop automates service through processes and workflows.

# Step 2: Craft a Value Ladder That Elevates Revenue

Russell Brunson emphasizes the importance of the *Value Ladder*. This structure maximizes revenue by offering ascending levels of value and price:

* **Free Lead Magnets**: eBooks or guides to draw in customers.
* **Low-Ticket Offers**: Affordable products that build trust.
* **Core Offers**: Mid-priced products or services.
* **Premium Offers**: High-ticket services or coaching programs.

# Practical Example:

A fitness coach might start with a free nutrition guide, then offer a $27 workout program, followed by a $97 monthly coaching subscription, and finally a $2,000 personalized fitness retreat.

👉 **Learn more about crafting your Value Ladder with the DotCom Secrets book (**[Free](https://dotcomsecrets.com?cf_affiliate_id=3705058&affiliate_id=3705058)**)**

# Step 3: Build the Funnel Using Proven Strategies

ClickFunnels provides pre-designed templates for funnels, but success lies in how you use them:

* **Front-End Funnels**: Use a Free Plus Shipping offer or a self-liquidating funnel to capture leads and recover ad costs.
* **Middle Funnels**: Host webinars or sell bundled courses to build trust and upsell.
* **High-Ticket Funnels**: Create application-based funnels to sell premium services.

# Actionable Tip:

Incorporate elements of scarcity and urgency to boost conversions. For example, Alex Hormozi highlights how naming and limited-time bonuses enhance an offer’s appeal.

👉 **Master high-converting webinars with Perfect Webinar Secrets (**[Free](https://www.perfectwebinarsecrets.com?cf_affiliate_id=3705058&affiliate_id=3705058)**):**

# Step 4: Automate Lead Generation and Nurturing

Kiyosaki argues that scalability is key to building a business that can operate without constant oversight. Automation is the backbone of a scalable sales funnel:

* **Email Sequences**: Use autoresponders to nurture leads, as Jim Edwards suggests in *Copywriting Secrets*.
* **Retargeting Ads**: Bring back visitors who didn’t convert initially.

# Example in Action:

An online course creator might use a lead magnet to capture emails and then send a sequence of emails sharing testimonials, case studies, and discount offers, ultimately converting warm leads into paying students.

👉 **Get advanced email marketing strategies with Ryan Deiss’** [Invisible Selling Machine](https://amzn.to/3uO0QZ4)**:**

# Step 5: Leverage Traffic Strategies to Scale

Scaling your funnel requires consistent traffic. Russell Brunson’s *Traffic Secrets* breaks down three types of traffic:

1. **Owned Traffic**: Your email list or followers.
2. **Paid Traffic**: Ads on Google, Facebook, or Instagram.
3. **Earned Traffic**: Organic traffic through SEO or social shares.

# Case Study:

A health supplement company drove $1M in annual sales by running paid ads targeting health-conscious individuals and funneling them into a free trial offer, followed by a monthly subscription plan.

👉 **Drive traffic to your funnels with Traffic Secrets (**[Free](https://bit.ly/3RYEko2)**)**

# Step 6: Reinvent and Reinvest Like an Investor

Once your funnel generates predictable income, treat it like an investment:

* Test new offers or pricing strategies (as outlined by Alex Hormozi in *$100M Offers*).
* Build additional funnels targeting other customer segments or product lines.
* Use profits to invest in physical assets, stocks, or other passive income streams, aligning with Kiyosaki’s Investor Quadrant philosophy.

👉 **Learn how to create irresistible offers with Alex Hormozi’s** [$100M Offers book](https://amzn.to/3RYEko2)**:**  
The Bigger Picture: Your Funnel is a Financial Asset

By systemizing your sales process through ClickFunnels, you’re not just creating a sales pipeline—you’re building a scalable asset. This aligns perfectly with Kiyosaki’s emphasis on creating income streams that don’t depend on your direct involvement.

Just as Kiyosaki’s quadrant encourages the transition from earning income actively to earning passively, your ClickFunnels funnel empowers you to generate revenue, even while you sleep.

1h37q94,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductivityPals/comments/1h37q94/how_to_improve_time_management/,How To Improve Time Management?,"Hey there! I wanted to share something that completely changed my life - my journey with time management. Trust me, I used to be that person who was always rushing, always late, and constantly stressed about deadlines.

Let me break down what actually works, based on my experience and countless hours of research and testing:

1. The Two-Minute Rule
If something takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. This simple rule has saved me from the dreaded task buildup that used to overwhelm me daily. Those quick emails? Send them now. Dirty coffee mug? Wash it right away.

2. Time Blocking
This was a game-changer for me. Instead of a endless to-do list, I now block specific times for specific tasks. For example, I do all my deep work between 9-11 AM when my energy is highest. It's like giving each task its own special appointment in your day.

3. The Power of No
Learning to say no was tough, but necessary. Every time you say yes to something, you're saying no to something else. I had to learn this the hard way, but it's made such a difference in managing my schedule effectively.

4. Strategic Breaks
I used to think working non-stop was productive. Spoiler alert: it's not. Taking regular breaks actually improves focus and productivity. I use the Pomodoro Technique - 25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute break.

Here's something that really helped me track these habits: I created a habit tracker spreadsheet that I'm happy to share with you for free. You can grab it when you subscribe to my weekly newsletter at https://theexcellenceeffect.com/. I share practical tips like these every week, focusing on personal growth and productivity hacks that actually work.

5. Digital Detox Periods
Social media and constant notifications are time vampires. I set specific times to check emails and messages, and keep my phone on silent during focused work periods. The difference in my productivity is night and day.

6. Weekly Planning Sessions
Every Sunday evening, I spend 30 minutes planning my week. This simple habit helps me start each week with clarity and purpose, rather than feeling overwhelmed on Monday morning.

7. Energy Management
This is often overlooked, but it's crucial. I schedule my most important tasks during my peak energy hours (morning for me). Understanding your energy patterns is just as important as managing your time.

8. The 1-3-5 Rule
Plan to accomplish one big thing, three medium things, and five small things each day. This has helped me set realistic expectations and actually finish what I plan to do.

Remember, time management isn't about squeezing more tasks into your day - it's about making the most of the time you have. Start small, be consistent, and adjust as needed. What works for others might not work for you, and that's okay.

I'd love to hear what techniques work for you and continue sharing more practical tips through my weekly newsletter. The habit tracker I mentioned earlier has been a game-changer for many of my subscribers - it's simple but effective.

Skylar 

  

Fall of 8th grade 

  

“Come back here you little b*tch.” A brunette goes flying by me with Barbie number 2, Jeanie, stomping after her awkwardly in her wedges and skirt so short and tight I wonder how she managed to keep all her bits covered making the smallest of movements, let alone attempted running. She looks livid and I can see the other two Barbies coming up behind her, strutting, since running or normal walking is not possible in the sky high shoes they are wearing. 

  

I don’t know what happened, but these three came back from their summer trip abroad and decided they were the queens of the school and normal rules of decency didn’t apply to them.  They were never what anyone would call nice, but they didn’t outwardly harass people either.   

  

As the beta’s daughter it was my job to make sure all pack members were protected, even from our own.  My father may not want me or take me seriously, my older brother was the true beta, but I took my rank and status seriously anyway since that is the one thing he beat into our heads since birth. We were not to embarrass him in any way as the Beta, the image was the most important thing to him. 

  

I step in front of Jeanie, hands up hopefully in a sign of peace.  “Why are you chasing her? What did she do, Jeanie?” 

  

Jeanie almost falls over trying to stop her momentum in her sl*tty getup. 

  

“She got me a D on my paper! That little b*tch was supposed to make me sound smart and get me an easy grade. She purposely got me a bad grade to embarrass me in front of the new teacher. Get out of my way, Skylar.” She snarls at me and tries to push me out of the way looking at me like I am some piece of trash under her designer shoe. 

  

“Did you pay her to do a good job, or did you just pick a smart kid in your class and tell them they were doing your work?” 

  

“What does that matter?  I am a warrior and she is just an omega.  She is beneath me and should be glad I was talking to her in the first place.” 

  

“Her rank and yours have nothing to do with your school work, and last I checked you are no warrior.  You are lazy, and don’t make time to train, let alone be considered competent. That’s your fault, do your own work.  Leave her alone. She didn’t volunteer and you didn’t pay her, she owes you nothing.” I refuse to move from her path. I don’t have my beta aura yet, but I figure fake it until you make it right.  I stand up as tall as I can, which is not much at my five foot nothing height, and keep stepping in her path as she tries to step around me, to keep her away from the girl. As a ‘warrior’ she should be more agile and be able to easily step around me, but training isn’t on this ‘warrior's’ agenda. 

  

“You need to watch what you say to your betters, you murderer. You are not worth sharing breathing room with.  Your dad thinks so, your brother thinks so.  No one wants you around, so move.” Kaley sneers as she walks up and steps around Jeanie. Marnie, hot on her heels like the good little minion she is, forms the triangle they have decided makes them the most intimidating. I think they have seen Mean Girls too many times. “No one cares about you or your worthless opinions. No one in this pack humiliates us and gets away with it.” 

  

With that she shoves past me and heads straight for my brother and his friends.  I know they heard what she said to me, werewolves have above average hearing, but as the Future Alphas, Beta, Gamma and Delta, they all have extraordinary hearing.  They don’t even flinch at her hateful words. They believe if you can’t take a little criticism, you’re too weak to deal with in the first place.  It’s not the first time she’s said those words to me, but they don’t hurt any less the longer I hear them.  I blink back the tears burning my eyes, take a deep breath and head home.  I hope the girl got away at least.  I hope she can avoid those three, but I might have just prolonged the inevitable.  I have a feeling this year is going to be a long one.  I just need to keep my head down, keep my grades up and stay out of their way.  Just a few more years and I can leave this hell hole. 

  

Fall of 9th Grade 

  

SLAM.  

  

Well, that hurt more than it normally does. A groan slips out of my mouth. I don’t remember the lockers biting back so hard. That’s what I’m thinking as I slide down to the floor with my eyes closed and feel the back of my head where it hit the locker, awaiting the next blow. 

  

“Happy Monday to you too.” I mutter to no one in particular. 

  

“You fat cow, stop getting in my way.” Kaley hisses at me before she slaps me.  I can feel a little bit of blood trickle from the side of my mouth, she doesn’t hit that hard, but her fake nails are as sharp as cat claws.  I can hear a couple chuckles and one is a little deeper than the others, that would explain the hard blow into the locker.  She had one of the boys throw me this time. I don’t look around though, Kaley may skip all of our fight training, but she has proven she can provide torture in many other ways and there are plenty of people who want to be in her circle so bad that they will do anything to anyone to gain approval. 

  

“What did I do this time, your highness?”  I ask sarcastically, risking a look up at her.  I’m hoping to keep her attention long enough for the kid she was screaming at to run away. Kaley doesn’t get her hands dirty anymore, she found out quickly when you are popular or just plain evil, people will do just about anything to stay on your good side, in the hopes of vicarious status or to not be the next victim. Having her father on the school board helps too.  None of her actions have ever been caught on camera, so there isn’t proof of anything she does, except the marks all over me, and she has everyone believing I am a weak nobody, that can’t take a hit or heal very quickly. A few kids have been suspended because of her.  She harassed one so badly he moved away from our pack to go to school in a neighboring pack where his grandparents live.  All because he wouldn’t break up with his girlfriend for her. We were in the fifth grade. Who is thinking about that in the fifth grade? No one talks about that though. The line the pack members believe or at least spread about is he needed extra guidance that the other school provides. 

  

“You do not stop me from disciplining a pup.  That little toe rag purposely ruined my brand new designer shoes in front of the whole school. She deserves to be punished.”  Kaley tosses her platinum bleached hair over her shoulder and rolls her crystal blue eyes at me like I am the dumbest person in the world for not understanding that.  It wasn’t the ‘whole school’ it was my brother, the future beta, along with the future alphas, gamma and delta.  Those five boys are rarely separated.  She was trying to gain the attention of Dakota and Cameron, our future alphas, like most of the girls in our school.  Her little minions were focused on the other three, they didn’t really care which one gave them attention as long as they were noticed. As Marnie and Jeanie were ogling the guys, Marnie tripped over this little fourth grader and dumped whatever frufru iced coffee drink all down Kaley’s legs. Kaley will never admit when she and her friends are in the wrong though.   

  

The guys walk off chuckling, not even noticing the red tinge to Kaley’s eyes, showing she’s about to blow a gasket.  Although, I don’t think she has ever shown them that side of her.  She’s not dumb enough to show them her true colors.  Her and her friends want to stay in the ranked circle.  These boys rule the school like they think our parents rule this pack.  They have no idea what they are actually doing, but they like the adoration, you can see it in their eyes.  Acting tough and ‘leading by example,’ as they call it.  If you want to be the best, act like it, until someone makes you prove it, then don’t lose.

I get to the the bar,  order a glass of dry red and setup at a coner table outside near the water feature... Quiet night and motivation is vibing. The perfect self celebration is in effect.

45 minutes pass by and well that feeling wears off and the alcohol kicks in. Time to order a coffee and go home. Enjoying the views of the lobby, there's a table of rowdy men who sound like they been on the bottle for a bit. Thinking nothing of it, I order for the car to be brought around, pay my bill and about to head out.
Literally a few steps in, someone from the rowdy table gets up and slips, trips and falls .... at my feet.
Me 😶🫥
His friend gets to him and asks if he's OK. Fallen man mumbles. Me... 😶

Can Skylar get past her past and live the life she wants? 

****************** 

Skylar 

6th grade: 

I’m walking into school behind my brother and Oliver, one of his best friends.  They really don’t pay any attention to me and only let me follow them to school because Mary makes them bring me. Mary is my nanny, she has been with me as long as I can remember.  My dad is the beta of the pack and really busy, so Mary was brought on to teach me how to ‘behave like a lady,’ which basically means teach me to be silent unless spoken to and out of the way of the men. She does nothing of the sort, but my dad doesn’t know that, as long as I make a good show when he’s around. 

  

My brother spends most of his time with the future Alphas, Cameron and Dakota, the future Delta, Sam and the future Gamma Oliver.  They travel in a group wherever they go, they are almost worse than some of the girls here.   

  

Mary told him to make sure I got to and from school safely after I came home last week with a bruise under my eye and scrapes up my arm.  I tried to tell her it was an accident and that I tripped, it was not a big deal, but she didn’t believe me.  She knows I have been having trouble with kids at the school.  I live in a werewolf pack that feeds on hierarchy and dominance, of course at some point we are all going to start trying to showcase our dominance, we’re middle schoolers. 

  

What I have seen though is it’s more the non-ranked kids who are trying to show off for the ranked kids.  They are trying to gain status by being noticed.  It’s funny to think that some kids are popular, just for the rank they were born into, not what they have actually done.  Obviously, everybody wants to be the Alpha’s kids friends.  That’s the height of all popularity.  My brother, Sam and Oliver aren’t far behind being rank born.  I, however, don't matter, even though I am the Beta’s daughter and have Beta blood.  I am the reason that my mother is dead, and that is reason enough to shun me to lower than an Omega.  That is why Mary fears for me, she has seen how kids openly treat me and no adult does a thing to stop it, not even my father. 

  

“Move it fatty. You’re taking up the whole hallway and walking slower than a turtle.  Are you sure you’re a wolf?” Kaley sneers behind me.  I just move to the side to try and get out of her way.  She sticks her foot between my legs and I trip sideways head first into a locker not being able to catch myself with my armful of books. 

  

The crash brings everyone to a halt.  All eyes are on me, but the only ones I care about are my brother’s.  He turned to look at the sound and when I made eye contact he just shook his head, rolled his eyes and turned to walk away, Oliver and Kaley following him.  The rest of the kids in the hallway disperse too, some laughing quietly, others not so quietly, but no one stops to help me up. 

  

7th Grade: 

  

“Don’t you ever question my authority in front of another student again!” Kaley shoulder checks me into a door leading out to the courtyard in the middle of the school. 

  

“I didn’t question your authority, I told you that you can’t hit kids just because they are in your way. If you were late, that is not their fault.” I shouldn’t snap back at her, it only fuels her fire, but she’s starting to get on my nerves.  She was late because she skipped second period to go get coffee with her friends and was late getting back to third period, who happens to be a teacher that will report her to her father.  Although nothing ever seems to happen when she is reported. 

  

I right myself, set my focus down the hallway and move to walk away from the door that was holding me up, but before I can get two steps, Marnie, one of Kaley’s little minions steps out to trip me, then proceeds to dump her iced latte on my head.  I hear cackles of laughter then others join in, meaning we attracted a crowd. 

  

I look up to see my brother and his friends joining in with the laughter.  “Maybe if you trained a little harder and lost some of that baby fat, you wouldn’t be so clumsy.” Kaley says not-so quietly to me then, “Hey boys, are we up for hanging out at the  fire pit tonight?” To my brother and his friends.

My husband works hard & is our only income since March. I love him so much, but I have felt invincible the last several months. And like he’s bored of me. I’m also so burnt out.

Since he works early I get up with the baby multiple times a night myself, I do every feeding, changing, putting to bed, bathing, I do the cooking & all of cleaning. I felt that was fair since he works. But, I’m so burnt out!!!  I don’t get more than 5hrs a night anymore, when she naps I usually have to use that time to get things done. 

I’m home alone all day with my baby, and miss hanging out with people! I’m very social but am now at home for days at a time. Once a week I do go to Marshall’s or a Thrift store for a few hours by myself just to get out of the house! I also try to go on walks with my baby in our apartment. But I’d like to be able to talk to people. To be social.

So this is my point. 
Today in the car ride to the store I might’ve gotten too excited & started chatting too much to my husband. I didn’t mean to talk the entire time but I annoyed him. He doesn’t know that I saw him but he started shaking angrily with his hands on the steering wheel and rolling his eyes. He looked so upset & his veins actually popped out. I just stopped talking & tried to pretend I didn’t see it. But when we got to the store I went to the bathroom to cry. This isn’t the first time he’s gotten upset from me talking. I guess I can be annoying. But I just don’t have anyone to talk to.

When he comes home from work he immediately gets on his computer to game with his friends. He talks more to them than he ever does with me. He’s currently on right now at 2am. I have no problem with gaming, I’m just kind of sad that it’s his priority.

I ask to go on coffee dates with him once every week or two. We go, but it’s so rushed & he’s quiet the whole time. I try to ask him questions to get him talking but he doesn’t seem interested or ignores my question. He finishes his coffee in a few sips & asks if I’m ready to go home. 

It use to not be like this. He use to talk to me & take me on dates to talk for hours. Even a few months before we had our baby he was noticeably distant. 

I don’t know if it’s the postpartum talking, but I want to leave. I want to pack a bag & leave. I guess this is just a rant. Since I really have no one to talk to about this. ",1,1732952370.0,Marriage,2,1.0,False

Opening a cafe had always been my dream—a cozy space where people could escape the hustle of Kolkata and enjoy good food, great coffee, and warm conversations. But while the dream was clear, the path to bringing it to life was anything but easy.

# The Overwhelming Start

The first challenge was choosing the perfect location. I wanted a spot that was not just accessible but unique enough to attract a loyal customer base. After weeks of visiting different locations, I either faced exorbitant rent or found spaces that didn’t fit my vision.

Then came the licensing process, which was an absolute maze. There were so many permits to apply for, and navigating through the bureaucratic processes left me feeling lost. I had no idea where to begin or what steps I needed to follow to comply with the regulations.

Designing the space was another major hurdle. I had a vision in mind, but translating it into a functional and visually appealing cafe was far more complicated than I had anticipated. Every time I thought I was on the right track, I hit a roadblock—whether it was budget constraints or realizing certain design choices wouldn’t work.

And then there were the vendors, equipment, and staffing. Sourcing everything I needed while ensuring quality and reliability was a nightmare. The complexity of hiring the right team and managing their training made me realize just how much more was involved than I had initially thought.

# When Help Arrived: S4 Consultants

Just when I was on the verge of giving up, a friend introduced me to **S4 Consultants**, professional [**cafe consultants in Kolkata**](https://s4consultants.co.in/industries/cafe/) who specialize in the hospitality industry. At first, I was hesitant. I wasn’t sure about the costs or if they would truly understand my vision. However, after a few meetings, I realized this was exactly what I needed.

The team at S4 Consultants didn’t just give me advice—they listened to my vision and pain points. They understood my goals and challenges, and they helped me see a clear path forward. With their expertise, I was able to overcome the obstacles I had been facing.

# Tackling Challenges Head-On with S4 Consultants

**1. Location and Licensing**Finding the perfect location is a crucial part of opening a successful cafe, and S4 Consultants took care of this. They provided me with a list of potential locations that were aligned with my target audience and budget. They also handled all the licensing requirements—from FSSAI permits to fire safety compliance—taking the entire burden off my shoulders.

**2. Design and Layout**This was where I needed the most guidance. The S4 Consultants team brought in expert designers who transformed my vision into reality. They proposed functional yet stylish layouts that maximized the available space while creating a warm, inviting atmosphere. They even suggested lighting, furniture, and seating arrangements that enhanced the customer experience.

**3. Vendor Sourcing and Equipment Setup**Sourcing the right equipment and finding reliable vendors can be a daunting task, but S4 Consultants made it seamless. They introduced me to trusted suppliers and negotiated favorable deals on everything from coffee machines to kitchen equipment. They even sourced locally-produced ingredients that aligned with my vision of offering fresh, high-quality food.

**4. Staff Recruitment and Training**One of my biggest concerns was assembling a competent and cohesive team. S4 Consultants took charge of recruiting staff and ensuring that they fit the culture of my cafe. They didn’t just hire staff; they trained them thoroughly, ensuring everyone understood the service standards I wanted to uphold.

# The Grand Opening

After months of meticulous planning, the cafe finally opened its doors. The grand opening was an exciting, nerve-wracking experience, but thanks to the guidance of S4 Consultants, everything went smoothly. The space looked exactly as I envisioned, the team was ready, and the menu was a hit. Guests raved about the cozy ambiance, the food, and the service.

# Looking Back

Reflecting on the journey, I realize how much S4 Consultants played a pivotal role in turning my dream into a reality. The support they provided was invaluable—not just in the initial planning stages but throughout the process. They helped me navigate the complexities of the hospitality industry and set my cafe up for long-term success.

As expert cafe consultants in Kolkata, they bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the table. Their guidance helped me overcome every obstacle, from location scouting and licensing to staffing and operations, ensuring that my cafe started on the right foot.

If you’re looking to bring your own cafe dream to life, S4 Consultants is the perfect partner to help you achieve success.",1,1732952304.0,u_Sampark_Welfare,0,1.0,False

Ever since about week 6 I have had pretty extreme food/scent aversions. I’m talking can’t even handle the smell of bread (uncooked!!) even saltine crackers are absolutely repulsive to me. Who knew rice could have an extremely rotten taste. I can’t handle the smell of coffee or any food cooking. Can’t even bypass this with eating out as fast/restaurant food is also a no go. I can’t even sit in restaurant. I will find something like a muffin or some fruit I can handle for a few days but it will inevitably become repulsive as well. Before pregnancy I would eat pretty much anything. 

Side note to my rant.. work is a special kind of torture. EVERYONE drinks coffee, microwaves all sorts or horrors next to my desk, and how do I pack a lunch when I have no idea what I’ll like in a few minutes let alone hours. 

I’m getting very frustrated by this and worried I’m not getting proper nutrition. I’m hoping someone else has had this and it’s gone away later in pregnancy. Any success stories/tips and tricks/or even other women who struggled with this would be so appreciated. I can’t find anyone I know who has had this problem.

Sorry for my poor English it's not my native language, I decided to fight my addiction to fun and dopamine,Last year I was in the worst psychological state ever. I suffered from severe depression for half my life. The situation worsened and I decided to end my life. I bought two grams, put them in a row, and it was my first experience with cocaine. I inhaled two grams in one line Luckily I wanted to buy heroin but didn't know where to find it. I found cocaine and decided to buy two grams because it was enough to end my life, What happened? Profuse sweating, high blood pressure and heart rate, feeling faint and at the same time feeling powerful and crazy and that I could save the world, I called an ambulance, that was the last thing I remember until I found myself in intensive care.Thank God I miraculously survived. After leaving the hospital a week later, I quickly went to buy half a gram, but this time to live. Since then, I have been drowning in his love and it has not left me until today, which will be the last time I used it  If god wants. . first thing I will do is dopamine detox, I will spend my full day on work , drink coffee with friends afternoon, I'm a business owned I spend in one year between cocaine and parties 🎉 and Alcohol about 90000€ My business is going bankrupt, I no longer care about money, work or success, all the feelings I want to get, cocaine gives me. From Monday to yesterday I was  sober from cocaine In a moment of anger last night I brought a gram and decided to use it just to see what it adds to me, I found the sexual desire intense,  ،  masturbation. My life changed for the worse, financially, health-wise, mentally, in all aspects. 

My desire to use drugs is very strong, even when I am not thinking about quitting. I have a large quantity. If I could, I would use it all before bed. I have started using cocaine all day long. Every half hour, I sniff a bigger line.

I remember in my childhood I was happy without any substances, why now I see my happiness only as cocaine? ",1,1732952203.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1h37gq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1h37gq1/aio_she_responds_quickly_to_my_texts_but_hasnt/,AIO? She responds quickly to my texts but hasn't been the first to text in 3 weeks.,"Both F and 30+ 

We used to work together 3-4 yrs back. Had a small thing but parted ways. We told our feelings for each other but due to various reasons, drifted and went NC for about 2 years.

I recently reached out about 2 months ago and reconnected...and she was RLY flirty just I was, but I found out she was still with her bf. I was shocked as she didn't mention him and was acting very strongly into us, but I said we shouldn't even be flirting if she has a bf. However, I told her I want to stay friends as I want her in my life. She agreed, so that was that. New friendship with slight fling history underneath. I was disappointed, but there was no exclusive or even serious talk or anything, so I just let all that go in terms of her ""leading me on"" or whatever.

Still, afterwards, she used to text a lot, send small gifts, hearts,  pics of her life throughout the day, squeeze in any time to meet up and I did the same, but no lovey dovey talk or anything. I mean, I text and send small gifts to other female friends, and we agreed to be friends, so why not, right?

A few weeks ago, I got sick and had to watch what I eat (digestion issues) for a week or so (nothing fun, greasy, fatty), so I cancelled us meeting up as it overlapped and going out to eat or coffee is what we did a lot. She said okay and texted me a lot during that week asking if I was okay, sending me pics throughout her day, etc. Looking back, I guess I also lacked texting as I didn't want to send useless stuff about being sick so I didn't text at all that week while she did. 

Anyway, during my sick week, she told me  that the upcoming 2 weeks (end of Nov) will be crazy busy so we'll have to meet afterwards (she's basically running a business and I knew about these 2 weeks even before getting sick, so no lies) as she'll be at work from morning to late. She even screenshot her calendar etc. We live kinda LD and both work, her until very late, so early mornings are all we had so no can do till she's done. 


Well, during those 2 almost 3 weeks, no texts from her. I texted her a couple things (3 small things in total gapped out within those weeks) which she responded to within 15 - 20 minutes, but it's been 2 weeks since she sent anything first, which she very typically did. I know she's busy and I don't want to sound like a baby, but not even a pic of her walk to work or something quick? As she always used to send those throughout the week (even after our new platonic rule)


The 2 busy weeks are coming to an end but not new set up to meet up. I messaged her within those radio silence weeks that I'm finally better, and she says that when she's done with all this work, we'll meet up, which to me, meant she'll have to be the one to text for the next available time. In that moment, I felt fine bc it was still within that busy time frame, but as it's ending with no update, it's making me have this anxiety.


Now, I can't even bring this up as her being weird or pulling away bc we're technically just friends...but still, should this be a sign that things are ending? Would you guys be nervous in this situation with just friends? Having a reaction like this is dating is also not really right as we're not. She has no obligation to my feelings or go anything as I'm not her SO, so she has nothing to really explain either.

Being offended over this and blocking her right now with no explanation from me would also be RLY weird and mad SO-esque which would cancel our initial promise to be friends.

So, AIO or should I just move on from this person, even as friends regarding these actions? I'm not texting first, but if she texts first again saying she was busy etc etc,, would it be overreacting to say ""You can't just show up after 3 weeks and expect things to be the same"" as she's not my SO or even a fling as we agreed, and she didn't technically disappear as she does reply to my texts fairly quickly, just hasn't sent one first for awhile.

Again, I'm not texting first ever again (as I already did a couple times within these 3 weeks) till she does first this time. But two, if she does ""come back"" would showing frustration be OR? 

I do want to keep her in my life, but I don't like ppl who disrespect me, and I can't tell if this is it between friends. ",1,1732952040.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

The feeling I get is just a numb or dull pain and a very obvious lack of any strength. I’ve resulted in using a jump rope attached to either my bed post or the coffee table to use and pull myself up. The only other option is waiting out the pain and applying pressure to the area to help lift me up. 
If I didn’t use a makeshift assistance to help pull me up it would take about 5 minutes for me to get up on my own.

1h374yh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXPreppers/comments/1h374yh/what_i_did_and_how_i_prepped/,What I did and how I prepped,"I am a very anxious person. My OCD makes sure of that. Prepping (to me) feels like having control over a very anxious situation, and I will admit I do feel like a wizard when my family needs something specific and I can pull it out of thin air like magic. I (29f) have been prepping for years. I was in my element for all of covid. We had masks. We had toilet paper. We had food. It was touch and go for a little while on some stuff but honestly I had it LOCKED down for the most part. 

I have tons of stuff ""left over"" from covid, and I'm back to stocking up before January. Here's what I did. 

First, I bought 3 large, 5 shelf wire racks. They're dense and heavy, and can hold a large tote or box on each shelf. I then bought 7 totes and labeled them Food, Hygiene, Cleaning, Medical, Household, Light/Electric, and Other. I bought two VERY large medical bags on Amazon, one for a self made first aid kit, and the second one for OTC medications. I crammed that sucker full of every bit of first aid I could find. Thermometers, bandages, wraps, a blood pressure kit, antibiotic ointment, hydrocortisone cream, poison ivy wipes, sting eze, allergy meds, cough medicine, cough drops, pain relief, fever reducer, gauze, tape, face masks, etc. If if was available I probably had it coming out the wazoo. 

Hygiene got stuff like soap, hand soap and bar soap, shampoo, conditioner, hand sanitizer, razors, toothbrushes, toothpaste, washcloths, no rinse needed wipes, tampons, pads, etc. 

Food (in this particular part of the house) got the long term stuff. Shorter expiration date stuff goes in the kitchen. But I have 5 gallon buckets of rice and oats, with more coming.  

Medical gets all the stuff left over after kitting out the medical bag. 

Household gets stuff like trash bags, disposable cups, bowls, spoons, forks, knives, plates, coffee filters, tarps, rope, clothes pins, rain ponchos, duct tape, camp stove and fuel (and a tiny pan kit that works with it), a large camp stove to hold a propane tank, water purification tabs, water filter, etc. 

Light gets matches, flashlights, batteries, lighters, portable chargers for phones (charged), a Jackery, and a generic solar generator like a Jackery that I got on sale. 

Other is for everything else. I bought a 5 gallon bucket opener cause they're a big pain in the booty to open without them. I also bought a GOOD manual can opener that can accommodate #10 cans. A frick ton of books that include things like foraging and medical (Where there is no doctor, where there is no midwife, where there is no dentist, + all sorts of others). Canning jars. Way too much pickling salt because 4 years ago Amazon had a sale where it came in like a pack of 9 so now I have 9 canning salt boxes. Borax. A good plunger. 5 gallon buckets (empty). More tape than you think you need. 

Another box holds Things To Do. It has cards, crayons, coloring books, board games, puzzles, etc. 

Yet another box holds pads and tampons. Yes yes I know, I also have the cup and I know reusable pads exist, I just can't get the cup to work right on me yet so I got the other stuff for now. We got 4 ladies in the house so we need a lot of them. 

As for ordering stuff NOW? I tend to try and stay a little head on my prescription medications even if I don't need them. I have promethazine and ondansetron I take for migraines so I am for sure getting that filled as many times as I possibly can while I still can. My inhaler, birth control, anything else I take. More food, but I might wait a little bit before stocking up on that. I need to make room for it first. My kitchen can only hold so much. 

Picked up 4 boxes of Plan B for the first time (Walmart had it online in a 4 pack for like $20 or so). More general stuff like soap and toothpaste, and odds and end stuff. I recently bought a new laptop and a new phone to replace a dead laptop and a super old phone in need of an upgrade. Paid for it completely so no worries about a new monthly payment. 

I have a grocery list that looks like I'm packing an Oregon Trail wagon, it's wild.  

And that's basically where I'm at. I always feel like I'm missing something but at this point I'm just going to roll with the punches. My family isn't worried about anything at all, but when they need something? Whoo boy, they're sure glad I pull all that stuff out of ""thin air"". ",16,1732950638.0,TwoXPreppers,1,1.0,False

Black coffee and colon cleansing are often discussed in wellness circles due to coffee's natural stimulant properties, especially its effect on the digestive system. Here's a breakdown of how black coffee relates to colon cleansing and digestive health: Natural Laxative Effect: Coffee, especially black coffee, contains caffeine, which is a natural stimulant for the colon. Many people find that drinking coffee can promote regular bowel movements, which may give a gentle ""cleansing"" effect without needing other interventions. Antioxidant Boost: Black coffee is rich in antioxidants, which help combat free radicals and support overall gut health. This can be beneficial for the lining of the colon and for maintaining a healthy digestive tract. Temporary Cleansing, Not Deep Detox: While black coffee may help with regularity, it doesn’t offer a deep colon cleanse like specific cleansing practices (e.g., colon hydrotherapy). However, it can be a natural, gentle option for supporting the digestive process. Potential Side Effects: Overconsumption of coffee, especially on an empty stomach, can irritate the gut lining or lead to acid reflux, which could counter the benefits of a gentle [cleanse.In](http://cleanse.In) short, black coffee might give a mild colon-cleansing effect due to its stimulant and antioxidant properties, but it's not a substitute for targeted colon-cleansing methods used in naturopathy or traditional practices. For a deeper cleanse, practices like colon hydrotherapy or specific dietary adjustments are more effective and for that you can contact us at Ace Wellness![hashtag#AceUpYourHealth](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=aceupyourhealth&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7259512975311392768) [hashtag#ColonCleansing](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=coloncleansing&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7259512975311392768) [hashtag#BlackCoffee](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=blackcoffee&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7259512975311392768) [hashtag#Coffee](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=coffee&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7259512975311392768)",1,1732949465.0,u_Ace_Wellness_,0,1.0,False

The cool night air brushed her skin as she dipped her feet into the moonlit pond, and it felt blessedly comforting. It was a wonder that she remembered to hike up her bridesmaid’s dress as she sat down keeping it clean and dry, or she would have to face the wrath of her sister if she ever decided to join the crowd once again.    

In the distance, a tune of a slow love song drifted, and the urge to join the party was tempting. But a quiet moment away from everyone was what her soul yearned for. She swayed solely to the tune, a hum escaped her lips as she sipped from the champagne flute. 


She wasn’t drunk, just tipsy enough to remember a moment in the past, tipsy enough to want to be in that moment again. She wanted a life. Not wallow in self-pity for a ruined relationship that happened five months ago. She wanted to be happy. Not to go back to a monotonous life of coffee, work and microwaved dinner. 

Someone coughed, and Iris was startled out of her reverie, sloshing the bubbly champagne and almost ruining her dress. Annoyed at being disturbed in her quiet moment, she turned around her lips pulling down to offer some harsh words, only to be struck dumb by the newcomer’s presence.

Hello there! 
I am Myth, 21+ female with nearly nine years of roleplaying. 

Today I am looking for anyone who can play advanced literate male roles who writes in 3rd person POV, and who would like to work on a simple wholesome slice-of-life roleplay that flows from the above starter. 

Who will you be playing as? 

It’s your choice. Are you the Bestman or one of the groomsmen who accidentally stumbled onto her moment of solitude? A guest at the party? Someone she knows very well, like a best friend who has gone in search of her? Or are you a total stranger, who accidentally saw her wallowing in self-pity and decided to approach?

And what comes next? Let’s decide together.

My preferred writing platform is Discord, but I do not mind working on Google docs as well.

Please send me a reddit message if you are interested. 

Cheers!

First off I cannot figure out why but I deal with my anger like a child. Whenever I’m angry at home I’ll storm into my room and jump onto my bed and kick my feet and I want to scream and cry but obviously I can’t. I don’t know why but it seems to root from my family 99% of the time. I don’t have a bad relationship with my family in any sort of way. I wasn’t neglected as a child, as a matter of fact I have a very caring and loving family which makes this even more confusing. I often get mad at my dad quickly for no reason at all. I also seem to easily get angry when I don’t get things my way which is so childish. 
Today my family decided to go to a coffee shop (I am very picky) and my family began ordering immediately and gave me no time to look at the menu. They also told me that they wouldn’t have food at the shop but when we got there, there was food. The food thing kind of sparked a little bit of anger. But then when we sat down my dad goes “You didn’t want anything!?” And I very much did want something but for some reason I said in response “no” and he didn’t hear so he asked me to repeat it so again I said no and he once again didn’t here and so he asked what I said one more time and I snapped and said in a very rude tone “NO DAD, I DO NOT WANT ANYTHING”. I had no reason to get so angry he was offering to help.
Later in the day my family decided to play a game my sister suggested. I agreed to play and we ended up playing several rounds. When we were all done I suggested a game to play but my sister said “No I don’t wanna play that game” (she is 16) which upset me but I figured we could all play without her. But for whatever reason since she didn’t want to play my family refused to play the game at all. Then my family decided to play a game that my sister did want to play (I despise the game) but when I said I didn’t want to play nobody even thought twice. They just told me tough luck and began playing without me. So I went to a private room and kicked my legs and tried not to scream. It feels like nobody has any sort of regard for my input or what I think
I feel like I can’t process my anger like a normal person. People say take deep breaths, but I’m already too angry to be able to take deep breath. Some people say to count but it’s the same, I’m too angry to. 
It seems like there isn’t anything that can help me and I feel like I’m stuck just getting overly angry at tiny things. If anyone can help it would be much appreciated.

Today was my little brother's birthday.  Over the past few years they've all pressured us to go above and beyond on their birthdays.  We take each of them out to dinner, he makes them something, etc, etc. 

He checks in on them and always returns their texts/calls.  Often takes them out for coffee (they are unmarried, no kids) or shopping.  

Welp. Today none of them sent him a note wishing him happy birthday. They're on facebook & instagram 24/7.  I even reached out last week to see if they wanted to do anything on his birthday and they ghosted me. 

Because I've been through this my entire life I know that they did this so he or I would make some comment about it and in return they'd lash out about what is really bothering them deep down - thus the ignoring side of it all. 

I just want them to be alone and not deal with their BS every again. They haven't brought joy to our lives in years. I don't like changing myself to avoid walking on eggshells that will cause their illness to get worse. ",1,1732948621.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

I’ve been working on putting together a home theater setup and wanted to share what I’ve ordered so far to see if I made solid choices or if there’s anything I should reconsider. My living room is approximately 20x13 feet with a mix of open spaces and furniture. Below is a breakdown of what I’ve purchased:

Speakers:
	•	KEF Q350 Bookshelf Speakers (Pair, Walnut): $499.99
	•	KEF Q150 Bookshelf Speakers (Pair, Walnut): $349.99
	•	KEF Q250c Center Channel Speaker (Walnut): $479.99
	•	C34E MKII Edgeless In-Ceiling Speakers (Pair): $298.00

Subwoofer:
	•	RSL Speedwoofer 10S MKII: $449.00

Receiver:
	•	Denon AVR-X1700H 7.2ch 8K AV Receiver: $399.99 (with a $100 discount from Costco!)

Other Accessories:
	•	GearIT 14/2 Speaker Wire (200 feet): $57.98
	•	Fosmon HD8006 3-Gang 7.1 Surround Distribution Wall Plate (Gold): $20.79

Total Cost So Far:
Just over $2,500, including taxes and discounts.

My living room has the following setup:
	•	Ceiling speakers installed for surround sound immersion.
	•	A large wall-mounted TV as the centerpiece.
	•	Furniture like a couch and coffee table in the middle of the room.
	•	Open space leading to adjacent rooms and windows on one side.

I’m planning to use this setup for movies, music, and gaming. My main goal is a balanced mix of clarity, power, and immersive sound.

Questions:
	1.	Did I pair the right speakers with the Denon AVR-X1700H receiver for this room size?
	2.	Are there better value alternatives to any of the items I purchased?
	3.	Will the RSL Speedwoofer 10S MKII provide sufficient bass for this setup, or should I consider upgrading to a dual subwoofer setup in the future?
	4.	Any advice on speaker placement or additional accessories I might need to maximize the sound quality?
