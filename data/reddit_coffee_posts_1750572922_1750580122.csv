1lhit3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1lhit3b/aita_for_dating_a_guy_in_a_friend_group_that_his/,AITA for dating a guy in a friend group that his ex girlfriend was in.,"So back in November, I (F20) met a guy (M23) through Instagram and we hung out for a while as friends. He would invite me over to hangout, go to parties, clubs, etc. Over time I met a bunch of people. I became close with a couple of them and acquaintances with others. 

In December, he hosted a Christmas party and I was introduced to my now boyfriend (M20) to which I barely remember him being there because he had a girlfriend (F21) so I didn‚Äôt pay him any mind. I also was introduced to a couple of girls who seemed nice (ranging from 21-24). 

Then in late January, a friend group formed around this group, guys and girls, and they would mostly go out to local bars or shows and sometimes hangout at each other‚Äôs apartments and drink. At first, I wasn‚Äôt even being invited to these small events, only big parties, even though we had all become friends at the same time. Of course I felt a little left out, but it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. 

Eventually, one of the girls (F22), we will call her R, invited me out to the bar with them and I went. We all started hanging out pretty consistently but they all felt much closer to each other than they did to me. 

My boyfriend and the girl he was dating at the time, we will call her A, were apart of this friend group, but he wouldn‚Äôt come around every time because he had work and whenever he was around he was just very quiet and kept to himself mostly. 

There were a few instances where I would go to pick her up because she lived close to me, but we were very different and it felt like one of those friendships where you guys are really only friends because of a friend group. I had really only felt close to one of the girls because we had hung out outside of the friend group. 

In February, he broke up with his girlfriend because he felt as if they weren‚Äôt compatible (his words). They were together exactly 3 months. Keep this in mind. 

I hope this is all making sense , but to make things even more complicated, R actually had feelings for me and had asked to hangout with me, to which I agreed. The entire hangout felt strictly friendly, even to the point where she was trying to set me up with two of her guy friends. So I shut that down really fast. 

Anyways, the more we hung out, the more my boyfriend and I seemed to get closer. It was all very friendly at first, but he seemed to come out of his shell a lot. During this time, A stopped coming around because the break up wasn‚Äôt mutual and she was getting over her feelings for him. So in turn, I never saw her but the other girls would because they had already been close before the friend group was established. 

I moved into a new apartment and the night I moved in a couple of friends came over to celebrate, my boyfriend being one of them. From that night on I had them over every night and not everyone would be able to join every time, but if there was one person who was there like clockwork, it was him. He started coming early, we started texting outside the friend group, he would stay later and fall asleep on my couch. 

The tension between us quickly grew and one night half of the friend group went to the fair and later that night the rest of the friend group joined at my apartment for a small party. I thought everyone would be too drunk to drive home but by the end of the night, everyone had left and it was just my boyfriend left. Nothing happened that night, but the next morning things happened between us. 

We spent the next 2 days together, and we decided that we would tell the friend group. 

To make a very long story short, we went over to R‚Äôs apartment to talk about it and the only people there were 3 girls from the friend group (not even his ex girlfriend). They were PISSED to say the least. They called me every name in the book you could possibly think of, whore, skank, even a combination of the two. Threatened to beat my ass (mind you these girls are about 23-23), threatened me. R was extremely mad, she had thought the feelings she had for me were reciprocated, but the only time she would talk about her feelings with me was when she was drunk and I already struggle with accepting or even knowing my sexuality so I didn‚Äôt want to get tangled up in that. At one point, one of the girls had grabbed something off of the coffee table and threw it at me as my boyfriend and I walked out the door. 

They had viewed what we did as ‚Äúimpulse‚Äù and kept claiming that we could‚Äôve ‚Äúfucked any random person‚Äù, meanwhile we were trying to explain it was more than that, but they refused to believe it. 

Oh on top of that, these girls were absolutely ruthless to me, but excused my boyfriends actions saying that ‚Äúthey understand why he did it‚Äù but that i‚Äôm the most fucked up person ever for what I did. WE DID THE SAME THING??? They were acting as if I seduced him into bed with me that night lmfao. 

The ex girlfriend never said anything to me, she did text my boyfriend a paragraph though. Now all those girls are blocked. Some people from the friend group removed me on social media, others didn‚Äôt. 

With all this to say, I have a really bad sense of self and this is one of those situations where I really beat myself up. I have a lot of long time best friends so I know I‚Äôm not a terrible friend, I didn‚Äôt even really consider myself ‚Äúclose‚Äù with these people as we had only hung out for about a month and a half. But still, I tend to care about what other people think of me and a lot of those girls know people that I know. 
There was even an instance where we all saw each other out at the same rave in different groups and they were harassing me, yelling at me, calling me names, in a public environment. 

Two of the girls and most of the boys from the friend group still talk to me and interact with me so it‚Äôs like, was it really that bad??

Hey psychos üíä
Just checking in to drop my soul on the table and maybe find someone equally damaged in the comments


üß† Diagnosis: depression. Classic, persistent.

What I wanted from meds? Not peace. Not sedation. Just enough serotonin to stop googling ‚Äúhow many floors is too high to jump.‚Äù
Also:

energy
motivation
social openness
and preferably, the ability to flirt like I used to without sounding like an alien trying to roleplay confidence.



üíä Antidepressants I‚Äôve tried:

üßä Brintellix (10mg)

Felt like a Scandinavian poet trapped in a void.
No sadness. But no joy. Just me, overanalyzing the meaning of door handles while slowly decaying inside.
Emotionally? I was a ghost haunting my own body.

ü™ûEscitalopram (12.5mg)

Immediate brain fog and a personality wipe.
Couldn‚Äôt feel my own jokes. Couldn‚Äôt care about anything. Felt like watching my life with the sound off.

ü•± Paroxetine (15mg)

Like Escitalopram but now with constipation and zero sex drive. Thanks.

‚ö° Wellbutrin SR (150mg occasionally)

Dopamine in a bottle. Feels like mainlining hustle culture.
I become smart, focused, productive‚Ä¶ and emotionally useless. Great if I wanted to be a machine.
Terrible for dates, empathy, or enjoying music.



üü¢ Currently on Sertraline ‚Äì Zoloft 50mg (Day 4):

Tried this before for 2 weeks and it was actually great.
Not euphoric, but alive. Confident. Social. I felt like myself again ‚Äî the version of me that books hotel rooms with women and doesn‚Äôt text back.

So I restarted:
	‚Ä¢	Day 1‚Äì2: 25mg ‚Äì Nothing happened.
	‚Ä¢	Day 3: Jumped to 50mg ‚Äì felt a spark. Started talking. Brain lit up like an old car that finally turned over.
	‚Ä¢	Day 4 (now): Took 50mg. Coffee is a non-factor (I drink it daily anyway).
Still waiting for the same ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a god again‚Äù moment


‚ùìSo what I need from you:
	‚Ä¢	Anyone else felt this early ‚Äútalkative / confident / not-dead‚Äù wave with Sertraline?
	‚Ä¢	Did it last or vanish after week 2 like all the other fake hope pills?
	‚Ä¢	Or am I just placebo-tripping like a clown with a prescription?



I‚Äôm not looking to ‚Äúcope.‚Äù I want to win.
I want meds that help me flirt, dominate, build, destroy, and maybe cry just once a month like a healthy bastard.
If you‚Äôve found that cocktail, I‚Äôll sell my soul for it.

1lhisib,https://www.reddit.com/r/resinprinting/comments/1lhisib/my_unexpected_recovery_results_ipa_vs_denatured/,My Unexpected Recovery Results: IPA vs. Denatured Alcohol,"When I first dove into resin printing, a friend handed me a bottle of IPA they had kicking around. I used it for a quick pre-wash in a little container to knock off most of the excess resin. Then, for the main wash step in my wash station, I grabbed some denatured alcohol at the hardware store (the stuff you use to light a grill), because it was about half the price of the cheapest IPA I could find.

Both solvents cleaned my prints like champs, but after about fifteen prints each they both turned really cloudy. The IPA in the pre-wash bucket was especially murky. I hated the idea of throwing out that much alcohol, so I searched for ways to reclaim it. I split the used IPA and denatured alcohol into clear plastic bottles and tried to cure it.

First I put the bottles into my UV cure station and gave them a twenty-minute spin under the lights. There was some precipitation, but not nearly enough for me to call it a win. I didn't expect much, just wanted to try it. Next, I set the bottles out in direct sunlight on my balcony for a couple of days. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt have high hopes for the IPA because it looked so grimy compared to the denatured alcohol. Over the course of those sun-soaked days, more resin cured and either sank to the bottom or clung to the sides. The IPA‚Äôs cloudy grey got a yellow tinge while the denatured alcohol got a bit clearer.

Finally, I poured both solvents through coffee filters to catch the cured resin chunks. The denatured alcohol lost some of its murk but was still too cloudy to trust for a full wash step. I‚Äôll probably just discard it. The IPA on the other hand was a big surprise. Even though it had looked like a total lost cause while baking in the sun, once it was filtered it looked way clearer than the denatured alcohol. It might not be spotless enough for my wash station and it‚Äôs still kind of yellow-ish, but for that initial pre-wash it‚Äôs more than good enough.

An unexpected outcome from my little balcony experiment. Did anyone get similiar results?",1,1750579915.0,resinprinting,0,1.0,False

I have done both intermittent and extended fasting before. I want to try rolling 120s for a few weeks not only for weight loss, but to see if the longer period of autophagy helps my psoriasis improve which has gotten worse over time. I just finished my first 5 day fast without any issues and I'm almost on day 2 of my next one, but I have a few questions regarding it.

What would be the ideal refeed window that gives me the nutrients I need for another 5 day fast without sacrificing the weight I lost? With my last fast I just broke it with something light and had one big meal a few hours later as my refeed, but I don't know if that will cause too much of a nutrient deficit eventually. I've seen rolling 120s posts on here which are giving themselves a 2 day feeding window, but I wonder if that's too much for me. In case it matters, my big meal is a large egg omelet with chicken sausage and veggies like peppers, onions, mushrooms and spinach cooked in olive oil with a bit of chia and flax seeds sprinkled in. Also I have been taking two unsweetened LMNT packets with apple cider vinegar diluted water every day for my electrolytes.

I'm also worried about gallbladder issues potentially arising, so I'm debating having bulletproof coffee daily. I'm in such a caloric deficit so I don't think it'll matter for weight loss purposes, but will this severely hinder autophagy by consuming it daily? Also since I'd be consuming fat from the butter in the coffee, would a multivitamin, fish oil capsules, a psyllium husk capsules be too much to take with it? I know it is on a strict water fast.

My Dad told me to come live with him and to focus on ‚ú®getting better‚ú®....for more clarity my divorce was because he cheated on me, and when I found out he said it was nothing and he loved me, he just had made a huge mistake and then he did it AGAIN and when I confronted him (his best friend told me) he choked me until I passed out, and I woke up to his friend and him going back and forth and him crying and screaming saying he was sorry, he blacked out.

The early morning the next day like 7am, I made him tea and took it to his room and he looked bad and I said Dad please go to the hospital, he got up fast and went outside to try and breathe and couldn't and panicked and then asked my Aunt to take him to Urgent Care (My Dad hates hospitals so I knew it was bad) I gave him a hug and said let me get my purse and he said in a scratchy barely breathing voice, NO, no stay, I gave him a hug and gave him the tea in a coffee to go mug and he didn't even put on the shoes I brought to him (I found them in the car later). According to my Aunt....at fucking 9pm without ANY WORD BEFORE (she turned her phone off, and my Dad left his in his room)....They got to urgent care and as SOON as they got there they took him back and stuck a breathing tube down his throat and he died. üíîüò≠ She came home after 9pm all strict like....as soon as I heard the door *I ran* and said omg is Dad okay????? Wait, where is Dad? I've been calling you, your phone's been off?! She said GET YOUR BROTHER.

It was BAD for me I felt SAFE with him.

&#x200B;

Java Burn's primary claim is to enhance weight loss, and it delivers on this promise with impressive results. After incorporating it into my daily routine, I experienced a noticeable increase in my metabolism. This translated into more effective fat burning, especially when combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise. The pounds started melting away, and I felt more energetic throughout the day.

&#x200B;

\*\*Sustained Energy: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (5/5)\*\*

&#x200B;

One of the most remarkable aspects of Java Burn is its ability to provide sustained energy without the typical jitters associated with some weight loss supplements. Instead of experiencing crashes, I felt a steady and consistent stream of energy, which was instrumental in maintaining an active lifestyle. It helped me power through workouts and stay alert throughout my day, making it easier to make healthier choices.

&#x200B;

\*\*Enhanced Mental Clarity: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (5/5)\*\*

&#x200B;

Java Burn doesn't just target physical weight loss; it also supports mental clarity and focus. The blend of natural ingredients, including nootropics, contributed to improved cognitive function. This mental boost helped me stay on track with my weight loss goals by reducing cravings and emotional eating.

&#x200B;

\*\*Natural Ingredients: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (5/5)\*\*

&#x200B;

Java Burn's use of natural ingredients is commendable. It contains a blend of powerful compounds like green tea extract, green coffee bean extract, and more, which are backed by scientific research for their weight management benefits. Knowing that I was consuming a product with safe and natural ingredients gave me confidence in its effectiveness and safety.

&#x200B;

\*\*Conclusion:\*\*

&#x200B;

Java Burn is a game-changer in the world of weight management supplements. It doesn't promise overnight miracles but offers a holistic approach to sustainable weight loss. I've experienced firsthand how it can boost metabolism, provide lasting energy, enhance mental clarity, and support a healthier lifestyle. If you're on a weight loss journey and want a reliable partner, Java Burn is worth a try.

Need ko talaga gumawa ng essay. I decided to post here because I don‚Äôt know how to express my true opinion about the movie to my officemate.

Disclaimer lang, I encourage discussion kaya okay lang talaga sa akin na ikalat ang post ko sa ibang platform. All I ask for is to censor my username as per the presumed online etiquette.

Before my actual commentary, I want to share my personal experiences that relate greatly to the movie. Para di naman masabi na manhid ako.

**Story 1**: My Dad was an OFW for more than 10 years. His goal was to save enough show money to migrate the whole family to Canada. This was the late 80s. He worked in the Middle East and Vietnam. And his story is like every other OFW story we have heard of. Worked hard in his job, did odd jobs in between, spent as little as possible so he could send money as big as possible. When he came home, there was nothing. No savings. No life improvement. My mother was drowning in debt, stuck in poverty, and having an affair with a different man. When he asked what happened to the money, my mom couldn‚Äôt answer. Business na nalugi daw. 5-6 daw. Repair sa bahay daw. The usual OFW story.

My parents tried to make it work for the sake of us children, and according sa Family Code Law, the custody of the children is automatically given to the mother. So if he leaves my mom, he leaves us children behind too. Pero minsan may mga bagay talaga na di kaya ipaglaban. So he left physically. He still sends child support nonetheless. We reconnected rin naman after years of physical absence.

My Dad did his best to de-influence me from my mother‚Äôs lifestyle. He taught me financial literacy. I learned economics, sales and marketing, chain logistics, production, etc. all from him. He made sure I was financially responsible sa life ko. That‚Äôs why as an adult, I have a savings portfolio and am very very strict with my spending habits. When I buy I make sure na quality ang product in alignment sa market value. I don‚Äôt even have a Shopee and Shein account to prevent impulsive shopping. My friends hate it nga when we shop kasi binabasa ko lahat ng ingredients sa grocery and lahat ng tags sa damit. I live below my means. May occasional self-care spending, pero not too much na maiipit ako. For the most part, I abide by an essentialist-minimalist lifestyle. No makeup, no salons, no nail art, no trending fashion, no expensive gadgets. I try to live simply. Ang bisyo ko lang ay libro at pagkain.

**Story 2**: My ex-fiance was a breadwinner. His family didn‚Äôt have much, just renting a small apartment 2-3 hours away from the city center. His mother is a widow. He didn‚Äôt finish college. He had a younger brother who was still in school. Pero sya pinili ko among sa mga nanligaw sa akin na may generational wealth, may assets, may higher education. Pinili ko sya for his heart; his kindness, his work ethic, his sense of responsibility, and drive sa buhay. Tanggap ko na if you date a breadwinner, he won't have any left for himself or you. Ako ang gumagastos sa relationship namin kasi halos lahat ng sweldo nya, inaabot nya sa nanay nya.

Ang prinsipyo ko noon sa relationship, your problems are my problems. Ride or Die. Sickness and Health. We share one life. OA na romantiko kasi ako noon. Na√Øve pa. So I also give a bit to his family. Paid the bills. Helped with the groceries. Sometimes when ipit na talaga, nagbibigay ambag din ako sa pang-tuition ng kapatid nya. Minimum wage ako noon as a Job Order, sya call center kasi yung lang tumatanggap ng non-college graduate. Mas malaki pa sweldo nya kaysa sa akin. I taught him more complicated English so he can apply for higher supervisory position sa call center. Inisip ko, ang angat nya, angat ko rin. Tiis sa pagiging JO para if ma-plantilla man, secured na kaming dalawa.

He told me he wants to finish college. He doesn‚Äôt want to work in a call center his whole life. He doesn‚Äôt want a night shift job anymore. So I said sige, susuportahan kita pero patapusin muna natin kapatid nya para di masakit sa bulsa. I secretly kept a savings account na hinuhulugan ko monthly for his future college fund. I wanted to surprise him when that day comes. Kasi nga ‚Äúang angat nya ay angat ko rin.‚Äù

So when we broke up ang dami kong pera HAHAHAHAHA I deposited his secret college fund sa MP2 ko HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA kumuha ako ng konti pang-gala sa Batanes for healing journey HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ayun po, natauhan rin naman sa pagka-martyr ko syet mga girlaloo sorry pero di ko na ata kaya mag-date ulit ng breadwinner

**Film Review**: Honestly, all I was waiting for was the characters to say sorry. Binantayan ko especially dun sa height na ng conflict. Di talaga dumating. Either that or nasama dun sa na skip skip ko na part.

Apology isn‚Äôt power play. Hindi porket nag sorry ka ibig sahibin nun, talo ka or mali ka. It‚Äôs an acknowledgement na nasaktan mo yung tao regardless kung sino ang tama.

Everyone‚Äôs faults were obvious. But each time na nag-express ng hurt ang isang character, tinitira ng kabila bakit justified ang ginawa nila. Mas lamang ang hurt nila kaysa sa hurt ng iba. Nag competensya sila kung sinong mas kawawa.

Instead everytime there is a confrontation, they just drop hints or mga parinig to the other person and continue on their merry way like nothing happened. Kaya napasabi ko ng ‚Äúso typically Filipino.‚Äù Yung attitude na sweep under the rug lahat. Patahimik ang problems. Patay mali sa nagawa nila sa other person. Above all, walang accountability despite sa obvious wrongdoings.

‚ÄúBe the bigger person‚Äù is enabling behavior. ‚ÄúLet it go‚Äù is still an open wound. ‚ÄúIkaw nalang umintindi‚Äù is being a doormat. Hilig nating Pinoy ang magpaka-martyr, kaya the people who hurt us either never learned they have hurt you or get to continue hurting you without remorse. ‚ÄúNagkikimkim ka ng galit sa loob,‚Äù so we just continue mistreating each other, ganun ba talaga dapat? What you‚Äôre doing is invalidating the hurt person and facilitating the bad actions of others. Walang makikimkim na galit if binigyan ng closure yung galit. Ganun lang naman yun ka simple.

‚ÄúKasi pamilya‚Äù Eh all the more iba? Ok lang yan if sa opisina kasi you need to kiss-ass pero if family, dapat mas open and understanding kayo. Oo may mga specific conflicts na di talaga ma reresolve and ikaw nalang ang mag-adjust, pero sa storyline ng movie, grabe naman ka immature ang conflict resolution.

Inantay pa nila may mawala/mamatay before they understood the gravity of the hurt they have caused. If that didn‚Äôt happen, they would never acknowledge what they did, kasi nga for them, justified ang hurt na ginawa nila sa ibang tao.

How to reconcile and manage conflict ba? Sa marriage counseling, may steps na pina-practice ng professional, wherein meron talagang mangyayari na closure sa both parties, **wherein walang winner or loser.**

One, obviously let the other person express **what** hurt them and **how much** it hurted them.

Two, the other should **acknowledge** sa ginawa nilang hurt (hurt, hindi mali. It‚Äôs not about being the correct one.) The acknowledgement is expressed in their own words. Usually ang therapist ginagawa is letting the other party paraphrase what the other person said. If tanggap ng isa yung paraphrased problem, that means na pick up nya yung gustong message na ipadala, hindi na misinterpret or miscommunicate. This goes both ways. Ito yung wala sa movie. Never nilang tinanggap na may ginawa silang pagkakamali sa pamilya nila. They always justify.

Three, what now. Anong gusto nilang mangyari or how to they want to move on after the hurt. The couple needs to discuss how to want to move forward para di maulit. Wala to sa movie. Pinatay lang nila. Malay ba natin if dadadayin parin ba nila ang pamilya afterwards kasi wala namang lessons learned na pinakita. Basta nag bonding lang sila sa last moments.

Isa talaga sa mga top measurements ko of maturity is the ability to apologize. Sa working staff, sa children, and sa situations wherein they have to give way lang talaga. You‚Äôd be surprised how many adults are uncomfortable apologizing to children, especially to teens.

If you guys are interested in couple therapy strategies, ang suggestions ko is the case studies of licensed professionals na si Ester Perel and Jonathan Decker. They use well-tested psychology theories like the Gottman method and how to apply these in real life.

Honestly, I don‚Äôt watch local films. Not because I‚Äôm a snooty high-brow film connoisseur, but because most blockbuster local films highlight Filipino traits that I find uncomfortable that I end up not enjoying the movie. Yung obsession ng Pinoy na martyr ang babae. Yung misogynist undertones sa relationship scenes. Pakialamera na wala sa lugar. Yung walang spatial awareness basta magka-moment lang ang character. Normalizing group bullying. Normalizing insensitivity (Kasalanan pa ng other person for reacting. Di ba pwede reaction is a consequence of your action. Di naman magrereact ang tao if wala ka naman talagang ginawa). Normalizing lack of accountability.

I watch local indie films naman, di ko lang talaga stomach ang local blockbuster films.

1lhiftm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1lhiftm/interesting_reaction_to_suntheanine/,Interesting reaction to Suntheanine?,"I recently posted that I purchase some L-theanine in the Suntheanine form. 

I‚Äôve been taking GABA for anxiety and was looking for something to compliment it. 

My first time taking it was of the afternoon after work, and it took just over an hour to kick in and I felt quite relaxed and sleepy. 

Second time I took it at night before bed and woke up fine. 

3rd time was the morning after taking it. I had 200mg with a coffee. About an hour later I started to feel anxious, slightly upset in my stomach and really spaced out. It was like a mild anxiety attack. I kept calm as I was at work, and focused on what I needed to do, which helped me get through it. 

I‚Äôm trying to pin down what went wrong. 

Points to make are - 

- I stopped taking gaba whilst introducing the Suntheanine

- I took Suntheanine the night before (200mg) and then again first thing the next morning. Could it have been to close together and possible took too much?

- I had a coffee the morning of anxiety. I‚Äôm thinking maybe the caffeine mixed with Suntheanine caused a bad reaction? I drink coffee everyday with GABA and feel great, so this was out of character. ",1,1750578471.0,Biohackers,1,1.0,False

Shortly- I have 3 cats that mainly require cuddles and some play time. The feeder, water fountain and litter boxes are automatic (of course those need to be checked and filled/emptied). But generally low maintenance. Big apartment in a capital city in the heart of the historical center. 

I put in the welcome guide that the sitter is welcome to use coffee and tea makers etc kitchen appliances but to bring their own supplies. I did say they can freely use all the spices and condiments plus ofc all laundry detergents etc as I think it‚Äôs it would be wasteful to expect people to buy their own every time for short trips. I also had a professional cleaner come before I left, put clean sheets in the bed and towels out, and left a nice bottle of cava in the fridge as a welcome.

My sitter is questioning the coffee/tea situation, as well as some other things in the welcome guide. She says that of course she respects the house rules, but finds it strange that there is no coffee, tea and other basic supplies provided. She also found it strange that the key was at a hostel 250m away from my place, and said it‚Äôs better to be left with the neighbor and that it‚Äôs what everybody does to save time and effort from the sitter. As he had also talked to the neighbor and told me, that the neighbor is ok to store the key and that she would rather leave the keys there and not take them to the pick up location when she leaves. 
I also put in the welcome guide that they can use the work station but will need to bring their own keyboard and mouse (I took the mouse with me and I have a particular setup with the station). She wasn‚Äôt happy with that either and said it‚Äôs very unusual that not everything is in ready to use state. 

To be honest I didn‚Äôt even think about specifically mentioning these things when we had our pre-sitting call. Also she didn‚Äôt mention any of it but maybe that‚Äôs because this stuff should be standard? If I knew I could‚Äôve gotten some tea and coffee ready for the sitter, but tbh I‚Äôm not comfortable to let her dig in to my mushroom blend coffee or to start explaining what is what (I don‚Äôt have ‚Äòregular‚Äô coffee or tea). And I don‚Äôt know my neighbors at all, I‚Äôve recently moved in and absolutely wouldn‚Äôt bother them with keys. 
Anyhow, how I arranged the place for the sitter felt ‚Äònormal‚Äô and reasonable, but maybe I‚Äôm assuming too much and not familiar with the ‚Äòunspoken etiquette‚Äô of arranging the sits? 

I think it should also be good value for the sitter, as a basic hotel rate start from 200euros per night and similar airbnb for 10days would be over 3000 euros.

They are diagnosed (UK). Registered disabled, lives alone and been really struggling.

For a long while (10+ years)  i, unfortunately, have been misunderstanding the illness. They have been trying to explain, but the illness has been shifting. Their coping techniques have also been shifting. One day they seem to be fine and will push themselves to do things that everyone is advising them not to do.. The next minute they are 'not willing to even try' (unfair interpretation). When I inquire why this seems to happen, B says that they don't know when they are going to feel good, so when they do they want to not lose out. I must admit, this led to skepticism from the family. 

Given the length of time, and the fact that B is now in retirement age, B had retreated from a social life and leant in to online life. (this now makes complete sense when there is so much support and acceptance online, with no risk of letting people down by being ill). The negative impact is a real loss of the skills needed for social engagement, and a radicalisation of thought (lots of misinformation and conspiracy talking points). 

The cognitive fog (B experiences it particularly in the evenings. Having a period of relative clarity in the morning after a coffee) means they are  unable to have any thoughtful  conversation or make any decision after 2pm, unable to drive or have social engagements. Alongside this B has suffered large unresolved instances of trauma (they are unwilling to get support due to a fear of psychologists/counsellors). 

My particular family unit have always been gently skeptical (in our ignorance) alongside giving the benefit of the doubt and trying to always offer support and adapting regardless. Members of our wider family have been more skeptical and suggest it's all in her head and she just needs to try harder. This displays as disappointment and /or frustration which has really damaged the relationship (obviously). 

----

So.. I would really love to help other members of my family understand more about fibro, Obviously also help ourselves to understand more, and help B live a great life, as far as we can.

B has started to give up on other members of the family and lean in to us, as the only people giving real support. 

It would be really helpful to hear if parts of B's story sound familiar? Do people have any sources I can use to understand more and share?

On my rides I like to mark out stops for a toilet break etc. I only have the free edition, so I can only do custom waypoints and not custom POIs. In the latest version of RWG it looks like some places are being shared publicly, so those waypoints turn into coffee or food for example. What would like to see is these places marked out on the head unit so I know when to stop. 

When I sync a ride from RideWithGPS to my Bolt I will get turn by turn instructions (I'm guessing the head unit itself is calculating these on the fly since the default sync will be a GPX) but I do not get my custom waypoints - they don't show up in the cue sheet on the device. After doing some digging around it appears that if I export as TCX or FIT these custom waypoints should show up as a custom cue in the cuesheet. I have tried exporting to TCX on the RWG website (and double checking the TCX by opening it in a third party website to see if my custom waypoints are preserved), and then importing them manually with the ELEMNT app and sending them over to the Bolt - but they STILL don't show up?

What am I doing wrong? Why is it so hard to get custom waypoints on a Bolt?",1,1750577868.0,wahoofitness,0,1.0,False

Bathroom

Step 1: Declutter

First, declutter the space. Remove any items that have landed on the countertops, put them away, and remove the towels, bath mats, and shower curtains. ‚ÄúPop them in the washing machine, so they can be washed while you clean,‚Äù suggests Stein.

Step 2: Work From Top To Bottom

Start from top to bottom and dust everything in your bathroom, or use a handheld vacuum and brush attachment to remove all debris and hair from the surfaces. ‚ÄúRemember, it's crucial to remove all dust before applying any cleaning products to your surfaces, so you aren‚Äôt just pushing wet debris around,‚Äù warns Stein.

Step 3: Disinfect Shower, Tubs, And Toilet

Spray the shower and tubs with cleaner and let it sit for 15 minutes while you disinfect the toilet seats, handles, backs, base, and more. Clean the base of the toilet that is on the floor and all the knobs, too. After that, scrub the inside of the bowl before moving on.

Step 4: Clean Mirrors

Clean the mirrors with glass cleaner or rubbing alcohol and a lint-free rag, paper towel, or even newspaper.

Step 5: Clean The Sink

‚ÄúSpray the sinks and countertops with disinfectant‚Äîlet the disinfectant/cleaner sit on the surface of the countertops for a few minutes while you wipe down any of those cotton ball jars, cotton swab containers, soap dispensers, or other items you put aside,‚Äù says Stein. ‚ÄúScrub the inside of the sink with a good scrub brush, faucet included, and then wipe down the countertops after for a fresh start.‚Äù

Step 6: Scrub The Shower

Use a good scrub brush or scrub mop to clean the walls, floor, corners, door, water guard on door, and grout between tiles in the bathtub/shower. Use a soft sponge or brush to clean the fixtures (shower head, handles, and tub spout), so as not to scratch them. Rinse the shower well. If you have hard water remaining on your glass shower doors, Stein suggests spraying vinegar on them and letting them sit for 15 minutes to 12 hours, before scrubbing with a sponge and rinsing clean.

Once you‚Äôre done cleaning the shower, you can squeegee the entire shower and dry all fixtures and any water remaining on walls, floors, doors, etc. ‚ÄúA dry shower is the best way to avoid water spots, mold and bacteria,‚Äù explains Stein.

Step 7: Dust Window Treatments

Clean the windows and window treatments by dusting or washing blinds or curtains, according to their care instructions. Then, use a glass cleaner and a lint-free cloth to clean the windows.

Step 8: Wipe Out The Cabinets

Wipe the cabinet and drawer doors (inside and out) and take the time to remove all bins or items in the cabinets and wipe the inside down. ‚ÄúYou can also do some light decluttering if you are up for the task,‚Äù suggests Stein. ‚ÄúRemember to empty the trash and disinfect the wastebasket bin too.‚Äù

Step 9: Vacuum And Mop Floors

Vacuum the floors and mop them for a perfectly clean room. If time allows, scrub the grout with a tough scrub brush and some cleaner before you mop those floors to remove any deep-set-in stains. Stein suggests replacing towels, shower curtains, shower liners, and bath mats before exiting the room.

Kitchen

Step 1: Declutter

Start by removing any items that do not belong in the kitchen, as well as any small appliances, utensils, or dishes that are cluttering your countertops. ‚ÄúTake everything off the countertops, including small appliances, cutting boards, and other items, and store them in their proper place,‚Äù suggests Stein.

Step 2: Get Rid Of Crumbs And Dust

Dust the entire room first, and take out any kitchen towels, floor mats, or other linens and launder them at this time.

Step 3: Clean The Stove

Remove the stove burners and grates and soak them in hot, soapy water in the sink. ‚ÄúWhile they soak, wipe down the stovetop with a degreaser, making sure to clean any spills or residue that has accumulated,‚Äù suggests Stein. ‚ÄúYou can also use a handheld vacuum to suck up any crumbs on the stovetop, before wiping it with cleaner.‚Äù After you‚Äôve fully cleaned the stovetop, use a little bit of rubbing alcohol or glass cleaner over it to make it shine.


Remove racks from the oven and soak them in the sink or put them in the dishwasher. Spray the inside of the oven and let sit for 30+ minutes before scrubbing it down. ‚ÄúWhile the cleaner sits inside, wipe the outside of the oven down with a mild cleaner and then go over with a specialty cleaner,‚Äù suggests Stein.

Step 4: Wipe Down The Microwave

Microwave a bowl of water and lemon for two to five minutes. Remove the bowl with oven mitts and wipe the debris from the inside of the microwave. ‚ÄúYou can wipe the exterior, following the same rules as the oven exterior,‚Äù says Stein. ‚ÄúIf your microwave is above the stovetop, remove the air vent filters and soak in the sink with the stovetop grates.‚Äù

Step 5: Refresh The Refrigerator

Toss any expired food and wipe the shelves down in your refrigerator. Move on to wiping down the exterior of your refrigerator and freezer (following the same rules as the oven exterior), and vacuum the coils. Don‚Äôt forget to clean the refrigerator‚Äôs water and ice dispenser.

Step 6: Wipe Down Small Appliances

Wipe down small appliances, such as the air fryer, toaster, and coffee maker.

Step 7: Wash Appliance Parts

Return to the sink, and scrub and rinse all of the grates, filters, and racks sitting in the sink. ‚ÄúDry them well and return them to their appropriate appliance,‚Äù advises Stein. ‚ÄúIf any dishes, pots, or pans have also accumulated in the sink, wash them now or load the dishwasher and run it.‚Äù

Step 8: Scrub The Sink

Start scrubbing the sink by removing all the gunk first‚Äîpull out any goop in the garbage disposal and scrub it. Then coat your sink in dish soap and lightly scrub with a sponge to remove all food particles, stuck-on-gunk, and more. Rinse well, and follow up with the appropriate sink cleaner for the material you have (for example, if you have a stainless-steel sink, Stein recommends using Bar Keepers Friend). Spray generously on the sink and scrub it in with a cleaning sponge.

Make sure to scrub the sink faucet, handles, and any other metal fixtures with a soft brush or sponge to remove any buildup or stains. ‚ÄúLet the cleaner sit for 10 minutes while you clean the cabinets,‚Äù suggests Stein. ‚ÄúReturn to the sink, rinse it well, and dry it out fully to avoid water spots.‚Äù

Step 9: Wipe Down Cabinets

While your sink cleaner is sitting, clean the exterior of your cabinets. If you have wood cabinets, a mixture of warm water and a tablespoon of dish soap in a bucket is a great cleaning solution, according to Stein. ‚ÄúUse a microfiber cloth, dip it in, and wring it out very well‚Äîthe rag should be barely damp,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWipe the exterior of the cabinets and drawers, drying immediately as you clean.‚Äù

If time allows, remove all items from the cabinets and drawers, and wipe down the interior with a damp cloth. Remove any liners and replace them with new ones, if necessary. Organize the contents of the cabinets and drawers and throw away any expired or unused items.

Step 10: Clean The Countertops

Using a disinfectant cleaner, wipe down the countertops. ‚ÄúClean the backsplash tiles with a gentle cleaner and wipe down the grout with a toothbrush or scrub brush,‚Äù says Stein. ‚ÄúIf you have granite, I would recommend going back in with a granite cleaner to clean up the countertops.‚Äù

Step 11: Scrub Trash Bins

Empty the trash, recycling, and compost bins as necessary, and scrub them with soap and a scrub brush.

Step 12: Clean The Dishwasher Interior

Once the dishwasher is empty, use a soft scrub brush to remove any gunk in the corners, empty the filter, and run a cleaning cycle with a dishwasher cleaner.

Step 13: Vacuum And Mop The Floor

Sweep or vacuum the kitchen floor to remove any loose dirt or debris, and then mop the floor with a heavy-duty cleaner, making sure to clean any spills or stains. ‚ÄúPay special attention to the areas around the stove and sink, as they tend to accumulate the most dirt and grime,‚Äù says Stein. ‚ÄúReplace all towels and floor mats with clean ones and your kitchen is done.‚Äù

Bedroom

Step 1: Remove Clutter

The first thing you want to do is remove any clutter in your bedroom‚Äîthink clothes, books, and any other items that should be put away into their respective spots. Use a damp microfiber cloth and a dusting brush or a vacuum with a brush attachment, and dust everything from the top of the ceiling fan or light fixtures to the baseboards. ‚ÄúRemove any dust from the ceiling, walls, fans, light fixtures, window sills, and corners of the room before moving on to dusting the night stands, dresser, shelves, picture frames, lamps, and other decorations,‚Äù suggests Stein.

Step 2: Dust And Wipe Down Windows

Clean your bedroom windows. Dust or wash blinds or curtains according to their care instructions. Then, use a glass cleaner and a lint-free cloth to clean the windows.

Step 3: Wash The Bedding

Strip off all of your bedding, including your sheets, pillowcases, comforter or duvet, and mattress topper/cover. ‚ÄúWash them according to the manufacturer's instructions, and don‚Äôt forget to clean any decorative throw blankets and pillows, too,‚Äù says Stein. ‚ÄúClean them now so they will be washed and ready to return to the room by the time you are done.‚Äù

Step 4: Vacuum The Mattress

While your sheets are off the bed, this is a great time to clean your mattress. Dust mites can be in your mattress, so make sure you are vacuuming the mattress first and steam cleaning with a handheld steamer after. Let the mattress dry completely. To remove odors, Stein suggests sprinkling some baking soda on it and letting it sit for about 30 minutes. Vacuum it up using your vacuum cleaner's upholstery attachment.

Step 5: Dust The Furniture

If you have an upholstered bed frame, you‚Äôll want to ensure you are vacuuming it now to remove dust and debris that gets stuck in it. While your mattress airs out, or the baking soda is sitting on the mattress, move on to wiping the surfaces. ‚ÄúUse the appropriate cleaner for the material of your dressers and nightstands, and wipe all furniture to clean it,‚Äù says Stein. ‚ÄúThis includes the front of the drawers and handles.‚Äù

Step 6: Put Things In Their Place

While deep cleaning the bedroom, this is a great time to hang up any clothes that are on the floor, reorganize drawers, or go through your closet and donate items that you no longer need. When in your closet, make sure to vacuum or dust the shelves and wipe them down for a clean room. ‚ÄúReplace all bedding, pillows, or other linens you laundered,‚Äù suggests Stein.

Step 7: Clean The Floor

Stein suggests wiping down the door knobs, lamp cords, doors, and light switches. Then vacuum the floors, including under the bed, and any carpets or area rugs in the room. Don't forget to vacuum any upholstery or curtains, if you haven‚Äôt already done so.

Living Room

Step 1: Declutter

‚ÄúStart by removing any items that don't belong in the living room and find a proper place for them,‚Äù suggests Stein. ‚ÄúThen, organize any items that are left in the room, such as books, magazines, or remotes.‚Äù

Step 2: Dust From Top To Bottom

Using a damp microfiber cloth, a dusting brush, or a vacuum with a brush attachment, dust the entire room starting from top to bottom. Remove any dust and cobwebs from the ceiling, walls, fans, and corners of the room before moving on to dusting the shelves, picture frames, lamps, and other decorations.

‚ÄúTake this time to clean any knickknacks and d√©cor items before moving on to the big stuff,‚Äù says Stein. ‚ÄúI like to use dusting gloves to clean small items first, then I move on to lint roll the lamp shades, wipe coasters down, and wipe fake plant leaves.‚Äù Don‚Äôt forget to dust and wipe any electronics like the TV screen, game console, remote control, and more with a microfiber cloth.

Step 3: Launder The Linens

Toss all throw blankets, pillow covers, couch covers, curtains, rugs (that can be washed), and any other fabric linen into the washing machine and launder before returning to the room.

Step 4: Wipe Down Furniture

‚ÄúWipe down all hard surface furniture such as tables, chairs, shelves, and more,‚Äù suggests Stein. ‚ÄúWiping with the appropriate cleaner for the item, don‚Äôt forget to clean the legs and under sides of the tables and chairs, too.‚Äù

For fabric furniture, start by vacuuming it first, then, if needed, use an upholstery cleaning machine or spot clean any stains.

Step 5: Clean The Windows

Clean the windows and window treatments. Dust or wash blinds or curtains, according to their care instructions. Then, use a glass cleaner and a lint-free cloth to clean the windows.

Step 6: Clean The Floors

Vacuum or sweep the floors thoroughly to remove any dirt, dust, or debris. Make sure to do any spot cleaning on rugs at this time, too. Then, wet mop or steam mop the floors to remove any stains or marks.

Laundry Room

Step 1: Declutter

Declutter any items that shouldn‚Äôt be in the laundry room.

Step 2: Dust

‚ÄúDust the room or vacuum with a handheld vacuum and brush attachment,‚Äù suggests Stein. ‚ÄúDust the shelves, cabinets, tops of the washer/dryer, and any utility items in there.‚Äù

Step 3: Clean The Washer And Dryer

Clean the washing machine first. Stein suggests running the cleaning cycle, or if you don‚Äôt have one of those, run the hottest and longest cycle with a cleaning tablet in it. While this is cleaning, head to the dryer and remove all lint in the lint trap. ‚ÄúTake out the lint holder and use a lint brush to clean deep down inside the dryer‚Äôs lint trap,‚Äù says Stein. ‚ÄúOr, use a long vacuum attachment and clean out any trapped lint.‚Äù

Wipe down the inside of the dryer with a damp rag and clean the door, too. Then, clean the exterior of the dryer. Returning to the washing machine, once the cleaning cycle has completed, open the machine to let it air out. ‚ÄúPro tip: always leave the washing machine door open after a load to let it dry completely so that your clothes do not smell like mold and mildew,‚Äù suggests Stein.

Wipe out the inside of the machine, cleaning the drawers/compartments that hold the detergent, and drum around the washing machine. If you have a front-facing washer, Stein suggests making sure to spray some cleaner into the drum and let it sit for a few minutes to remove any mildew and gunk. Then, dry the inside completely with a clean rag, including drying the drawers and any compartments for the detergents, and then wipe down the exterior.

Step 4: Refill Laundry Products

Clean the exterior and the interior of any cabinets, after removing any items. ‚ÄúAt this time, refill any products that need to be filled or add it to your grocery list, reorganize cabinets, and make sure they are all wiped clean,‚Äù says Stein.

Step 5: Clean Off Surfaces

Wipe any countertops or folding tables, including the underside and the legs. Making sure you are also checking on any utility items in this room like water filters, water heaters, and other items to ensure they are all in safe and working condition.

Step 6: Vacuum And Mop

Vacuum the floors and mop for a clean laundry room.

How To Deep Clean Your Garage

Step 1: Declutter

Declutter and put items away, moving the cars or any vehicles so you can fully clean. Use this time to reorganize or put boxes away that may have been left out. ‚ÄúDonate anything that is not being used or put the donations into your car to drop off,‚Äù suggests Stein. ‚ÄúMake sure to put all tools away, [place] ladders in the correct location, and charge any lawn mowers, weed whackers, or other lawn equipment that requires it.‚Äù

Step 2: Get Rid Of Cobwebs

Dust the ceiling in the garage and make sure to remove cobwebs and other particles that are on the shelves or walls.

Step 3: Wash Doormats And Rugs

Wash and clean doormats and rugs or any fabric item that lives in these outdoor spaces.

Step 4: Wipe Surfaces

‚ÄúWipe any hard furniture, gym equipment, shelves, or tables that are in the space,‚Äù says Stein. ‚ÄúSweep up any debris on the floor and then hose down or power wash the floors if needed.‚Äù 

Tips To Keep Your Home Clean Longer

To keep your home clean for longer, get rid of clutter before it accumulates. Set aside a few minutes each day to put things back where they belong. Stick to a regular cleaning schedule each week to prevent buildup of dust, grime, and dirt. Focus on areas of the home that get heavy traffic. They may need more frequent cleaning than less-used rooms. Tasks like taking out the trash, tossing expired items from the fridge and pantry, making the bed, and wiping down surfaces often will help maintain a clean house.

1lhi6g5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeachingUK/comments/1lhi6g5/bullied_by_hod/,Bullied by HOD,"My school is currently under a lot of pressure with staff redundancies and cuts going on and it doesn't help that my HOD has always been on the lookout for ways to exploit resources and maximise people's timetable within the department (e.g. proactively telling SLT we'd do internal cover for colleagues going off sick so the school could save money on supply, etc). On the other hand my line manager is a miserable person and well known for bullying other staff in the past. Due to the fact they've been there for 20+ years and are friends with all the right people at school, they've got away with it multiple times, and this has been written off as 'strong character', so people targeted by them in the past have just had to leave. My current HOD is a pushover and in order to avoid confrontations with my line manager, they've ended up teaming against me. I can't give details of the bullying I've suffered by my line manager in the past but I can say my HOD went through a phase too before being promoted in the department. I've recently been told by both I'm going to be put on a support plan for ineffective behaviour management (been teaching here for a decade now), so that when classes are being difficult they will just pop into my room if not teaching and manage behaviour themselves. I've struggled with behaviour management in the past and still do at times, but undermining my authority by storming into the room and shouting at kids isn't the right way to support me. A month ago my line manager started popping into my lessons unannounced and stood there for about 15 minutes staring at me and the kids, then walked out. The times they popped in I kept asking if there'd been any complaints and they said no, they just wanted to see the class in action; they never got to see any misbehaviour. I genuinely think they're pushing me to hand in my notice. Every year for the last 3 they've come up with meetings between the three of us where they'd raise concerns about my teaching or lack of cooperation within the department (not coming to coffee break and staff socials), and I just feel like they want me to leave to save the department some money. Any ideas what I could or should do would be most welcome. Thank you.",4,1750577417.0,TeachingUK,3,1.0,False

1lhi4yv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1lhi4yv/insights_on_a_birthday_party_after_almost_a_week/,Insights on a birthday party after almost a week sober,"My best mate celebrated his birthday yesterday. He is extremely social, so I expected a lot of people visiting. Quite the opposite of me, because I'm on the autistic spectrum and tend to avoid overstimulation. Which is the reason where my problems with alcohol come from, I guess.

Since I'm coming up on my first the only one sober, I was a bit nervous. Can't skip your best mate's party. 

Then it finally hit me, that I should take a different approach. 

The party was right around the corner at walking distance. We were invited after 7pm. Where I live, it isn't weird for someone to visit a larger party even two hours later.

Normally, I would come in about one and a half hours later. The reason for it is obviously to pour myself some drinks to take the edge off and encourage myself to deal with all those people. You already know how that story ends.

So I thought the best way to deal with this, is to get there early on. I visited them almost at 7 sharp. I got to catch up with the party boy and his wife, their family. I got to welcome new guests and have some conversations about how the party was going.

That went on until about 11pm. Most guests then reached this ""threshold"" (give them another two rounds, and they'll go over the edge). They get louder, the music gets worse and the drinking tempo increases.

I thanked everyone for their time and called it a night. Walked home, got a decent night of sleep and genuinely had this ""after-enjoyment"" of a great evening. 

Just wanted to share. I'm writing this whilst sitting in my garden, sipping my morning coffee and read through the messages about last night and the complaints about hangovers.",7,1750577246.0,stopdrinking,3,1.0,False

‚ÄúNo, no, no, it was the Faragins, that‚Äôs why we wiped them out. That horned bastard was even worse than us.‚Äù Sor Hynam said, ‚ÄúWe might have been crazy enough to make bioweapons to kill off a whole population and enslave the survivors. But those guys made us look like saints. I honestly don‚Äôt know why you guys didn‚Äôt wipe them out before us? We enslave a couple of thousand species, most of which we ourselves made.¬† They made species that were monsters and just let them loose.‚Äù He looked at Machile as he was reading a book, he lowered the book and looked back at Sor.

‚ÄúBecause of that last factor, they made monsters and then let them loose. They didn‚Äôt help them reach the stars. They would never reach the stars after all, it‚Äôs a cruel experiment, but they didn‚Äôt aim it at anybody.‚Äù

Sor eyes went wide, then looked at the third man at the table who was watching a movie on a pad while drinking a glass of wine.

‚ÄúDid you hear that? They didn‚Äôt help them reach the stars?‚Äù

‚ÄúI heard you, and yes, technically they didn‚Äôt, they just manipulated some of your advanced species to visit their planets. They were always better than you at manipulation.‚Äù Elp N‚Äôsert said, and Machile looked at him.

‚ÄúWhat are you saying? Did they reach space? How many?‚Äù He was now a little more curious, and Sor shook his head.¬†

‚ÄúIn the north, seventeen reached space, and we wiped them out. We didn‚Äôt play nice, it almost used up our resources, and that‚Äôs how we lost everything. We were easy pickings for our rebellious children. ¬†After we wiped the Faragins and their ilk out here in the north, we barely had enough tech and resources left to temporarily block off the main hyperlanes. All gates had to be destroyed. We did it to give rest a fighting chance. Why did you think we created the Haran and Tufons?‚Äù

Machile looked at them, then at the fourth person in the room. ‚ÄúIs this true?‚Äù

She looked at the oldest man she knew in the universe, who had almost moved into the reading room of the royal library permanently.¬† Adam showed up about once a week to chat with them, but she had to deal with these three idiots every day. ‚ÄúYes, it's well documented. In the south, they ate themselves a pretty big piece of the galaxy. It wasn‚Äôt until the humans were discovered that they were wiped out, all sixteen of them.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll sixteen of them?‚Äù they said in unison, all looking shocked at her.

‚ÄúYes, humanity calls it the Butcher war. They allied with a few species and fought them to a standstill, then nuked their government and used planet-busting bombs to crack the planets. Most planets are recovering, but it‚Äôs a planetary extinction event.‚Äù She said as she pulled up the details on the screen.¬† She saw them all look at each other, then Sor seemed very confused.

‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt make, we made some giant reptilians there, so who made the humans? I only know that we just took a few thousand to experiment on. They are great templates after all.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot us, we never made people, we just guided,‚Äù Elp said, and then they looked at Machile.

‚ÄúWhat? We only visited, nothing more than that.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you taught them tech?‚Äù Sor said.

‚ÄúNo, we taught them morals and ethics. I see those lessons were ignored. They nuked themselves.‚Äù He was scanning the human files, and Elp laughed.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt study Earth's and human history?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to study Adam and Dirt, what does humanity and Earth have to do with that?‚Äù Machile replied, and Monori sighed and shook her head. Machile looked at her slightly confused.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're pretty dense for being so old. Adam is a human; if you want to understand Adam, you need to understand his people.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut he said he doesn‚Äôt even celebrate their holidays,‚Äù  Machilie replied. Monorie laughed in response.

‚ÄúBut Evelyn does, and just wait for the human Christmas. Take a walk in New Macao or New Bergen. Actually, just go to ¬†New Bergen now, it's wintertime there, and we are getting close to what humans call Christmas, it‚Äôs in about five weeks. It‚Äôs a good time to visit them. Stay for three months and study them.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚Äú You need to learn about the people who raised him. Don‚Äôt worry, it will be lots of food, gifts, and fireworks. Lots of traditions. You will love it, you even get three right after each other. They are going to celebrate ¬†Christmas, New Year, and the Second New Year in one go. Besides, I want you three out of my library for a few weeks. I need a break from your eternal debate about the ethical morality of the Kunitas, They are a hive-minded society. The ethics of their culture and species are decided by the queen, and since they are hive-minded, her words are always morally correct.¬† And yes, from the outside, you can disagree, but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it‚Äôs her world, her people, and they are drones, not sentient beings. So off you go. Try the mulled wine, go skiing, and then go after-skiing and get a date. But do not come back for at least three months. OUT!‚Äù ¬†She stared at them, and they took one look, then grabbed their pads and bowed out of respect.

‚ÄúAs Sisu commands,‚Äù Elp said and glared at him, as they all quickly made their way out, already debating something about why some humans had decided to make a city so far north, tucked between mountains and fjords, ¬†Monori had an answer for that, too. Humans are just that crazy, and for some reason, they like snow, mountains, and the sea.¬† She called a droid to clean up after the three, then went to her room and sat down.¬† She took a minute to rest when a message came through from Sarah Nam, requesting a cross-check of their intel against publicly available information, including maps of areas on several different planets, as well as the historical lineage of a noble Wossir house and their resources. ¬†As well as the public knows about the banks that were involved with, along with the sources.¬† She looked at the request and sighed. She was up to something and needed to make it believable that Adam had not been involved. ¬†She gathered the intel quickly and sent it to her.

Then she contacted Sig-San and told him that his crew should do their own homework. He said it wasn‚Äôt him; those guys belonged to Roks.

Roks was surprised and said he had not approved anything, but he would tell them.

She got up and went to the kitchen for a cup of coffee.

‚ÄúBad day?‚Äù¬† Adams' voice surprised her; she was sure he should be home now. She turned and saw him leaning on a counter, drinking a cup.

She nodded and looked into his eyes just to confirm it was truly him.  
‚ÄúI thought you would be home?‚Äù

‚ÄúHad a meeting with a young noble, he wanted to hide from his father and live as a commoner. Something about his father wanting to marry him away to a princess he had never met.‚Äù

She looked at him and chuckled. ‚ÄúAnd if I recall, then you had a runaway princess asking the same last week.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I have granted both of them their wishes.‚Äù He smiled, and she knew where this was going.

‚ÄúYou have placed them together, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúMmhmm, they are working in a sanitation department, both have piloting skills, so they are going to be on the same hauler. I told them that nobody would believe a noble would be working there, so nobody would look there. They don‚Äôt know about each other either. Let‚Äôs see how that will go. It‚Äôs a four-crew ship, the others are the captain and his husband. They are both friends of my wife, old Navy guys. Evelyn thought it would be funny.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt happen to be Signana‚Äôs, the princes and princesses?‚Äù

‚Äúfuck.. another one?‚Äù He sighed.

‚ÄúGalios joke, The mended heart. ‚ÄúShe said, and Adam looked at her.

‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs a story about two plants and a broken heart that turned into a tree.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Signana‚Äôs are what a human would call a plant-based humanoid. The green skin wasn‚Äôt a big enough hint?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I was more fascinated by the insanely colorful hair. Besides, how are they going to make their people so powerful? It‚Äôs a three-colonial society.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook who‚Äôs talking. ¬†Stop trying to argue your way out of it, besides, it‚Äôs a pretty cool prank.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, it is, I‚Äôm glad you didn‚Äôt tell her friends who they are. Oh well. Nobody will find out I was behind it anyway.¬† So what are you doing in four weeks' time?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôm at your house celebrating Christmas because Evelyn demands it?‚Äù Sahe replied with a smile, and he just chuckled.

‚ÄúYes, she did. Christmas party. It's mostly for the kids. I don‚Äôt know why they won‚Äôt understand it, I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs for her as well, but I don‚Äôt mind a party.‚Äù  
‚ÄúJust give me a date and time, and I will be there. ‚Äú

‚ÄúGood, I would say bring a date, but Arus is also coming.‚Äù

She blushed as he winked, ‚ÄúI got eyes, you know. I‚Äôm just happy for you guys.‚Äù

His watch buzzed, and he looked at it.

‚ÄúI got to go, wife needs a break, and that means I‚Äôm on diaper duty.‚Äù He finished the cup and winked as he left. She watched him leave, and the room felt a little emptier than it should. She got her cup and walked back to the library. She looked up 'Human' and 'Christmas party', remembering she was going onto a human internet, and added a safe-for-work filter. She then started to read.

‚ÄúHow long have you been working?‚Äù His soft, magical voice awoke her from the screen, and she turned to Arus. He was all dressed up, and it took her a second before she remembered. ‚ÄúDinner date. Today! Oh shit. I forgot. I will go change now. How much time do I have?‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo hours, I knew you would be stuck in some research. I even had some dresses picked out for you.‚Äù He replied, and she looked at him.

‚ÄúTwo hours? I got enough time, just let me finish‚Ä¶‚Äù He turned off the screen.

‚ÄúNo, my dear, go get yourself ready first.‚Äù She looked up at him, sulked, and walked to her quarters. His droid followed with a small rolling cabinet.‚Äù He just smiled as he looked after her. She decided to walk out extra stiffly, but she was smiling from ear to ear, not that he could see.

Three hours and one hour too late, she stepped out of the shuttle feeling like a queen with her king at her side.¬† The first atmospheric village on Pele, Janivo, opened two weeks ago, and she had mentioned that she wanted to try out the Buskar restaurant that had opened there. Of course, the fool had reserved the whole place for just them.¬† He guided her inside, and they got a table near the great panoramic view of the planet's reddish clouds. ¬†¬†

‚ÄúI hope you like it, we have the night for ourselves. They say the Ginisat is superb.‚Äù Arus said.

¬†‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little too spicy for me, I prefer the Misinda.‚Äù She replied as she studied him. The more time she spent with him, the more whole she felt.

‚ÄúMisinda, it is then, if you don‚Äôt mind, then I will try the Ginisat.‚Äù He smiled and poured her a glass of red liquid. She looked at him. ‚ÄúWine? You know I quit.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, and no, it's not wine. ¬†It‚Äôs a non-alcoholic drink by the Buskar called Sash. It's great for food.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou thought about everything.‚Äù She smiled as she pretended to know nothing about Sash, how it was made, and what dishes it was known to be paired with.

‚ÄúI try to, I can't impress you with knowledge, so I just have to surprise you with stories and surprises.‚Äù He said as a waiter came over with a tray that had a single scroll on it. She looked at it, then at Arus, and back at the scroll.

‚ÄúI thought about flowers, but I think you would prefer this instead.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Scisya scroll of Hyndas,‚Äù

‚ÄúKing Hyndas diary? How did you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know people, and when I told them who it was for and where it would be placed, they willingly gave it up. ¬†They wanted you to have it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWanted me? No threats or looming doom?‚Äù She said as she picked it up and opened the scroll, the screen immediately sprang to life, and she could see the kind of speech. She closed it. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs the real one, not a copy?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's his second copy, the backup, the original is, of course, in the memorial. However, this one is the copy he made before the editing was done.‚Äù

She started at it and backed at him. ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

She nodded then smiled. She finally understood why Adam played these funny mind games on his friends, and she almost laughed.

‚ÄúYes, what?‚Äù He asked, and she took his hand, stroking her finger along his palm, and said yes. She could see him shiver as she did, and then she winked. Arus just smiled.

She looked out the window at the clouds. ‚ÄúDo you know what Janivo is named after?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúThe mountain of pleasure? In Haran mythology,‚Äù He replied, and she smiled.

‚ÄúGet your mind out of the gutter for a few more hours. No, it‚Äôs the Haran god's house of rejuvenation. It was also where many of the gods made their children, hence the misunderstanding of the gods' house of pleasure.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, are we here for rejuvenation or ?‚Äù he replied with a sly smile, and she laughed.

‚ÄúWe are here to enjoy ourselves and our company.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is the plan.‚Äù He replied as the dinner was served.

1lhi22l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lhi22l/aita_for_telling_my_friend_he_made_me_feel/,AITA for telling my friend he made me feel uncomfortable?,"I went out to breakfast with an old friend from HS (in our 40's now). We aren't close...maybe actually meet up in person every few years. He seems to have a recollection that we would have been a ""thing"" in high-school if he wasn't so shy. We chat now and again on FB. He is much more vocal that I am about how we need to hang out, he needs a good friend hug, and even has called me his best friend....which makes me feel strange since we are definitely NOT that close) 

Anyways, I don't actively avoid him but I just don't have alot of time. We had a decent time at breakfast, just went to a coffee shop. After about an hour I said I needed to leave. I pulled out of the shop before him and decided to run into the Walmart across the street before I went home. (important info: he saw me go straight instead of turn, so knew I was going there).

I go in, browse the isles. It's not a long visit. 15-20min. Head to checkout, then grab my bag and start to leave. Suddenly I hear my name being called out behind me. Lo and behold, it's him coming out of the men's room with the biggest grin on his face.

I immediately said ""Oh hey there, are you shopping also or are you just stalking me?"" It was a lighthearted tone of voice but I felt quite taken aback. He laughed and said ""No, I just had to use the bathroom."" So I said ""there were bathrooms at the coffee house."" His logic was ""well I had already walked out."" I kind of cocked an eyebrow at him and said ""And you just happened to be done right at the second I was leaving?"" He chuckles again ""I know right, let me walk you out.""

So he walks with me to the parking lot where \*SUPRISE\* he is parked exactly next to me. Stands there while I load my bag into the car. Insists on another LONG tight hug, then finally gets in his car. The whole time he is maintaining that he only went in there to go to the bathroom and everything else was just random....he had no idea I was going there, he had no idea I was checking out, no idea he happened to park right next to me...yadda yadda.

I felt pretty ick about the whole thing. After we left he messages me the following, ""Ok, you caught me. But you know I haven't seen you in months so I wasn't gonna pass up the opportunity to get one more hug or you know at least be able to talk to you for a few more moments."" Made me feel even ickier about the situation and I just left it on read until I could decide how I wanted to handle it.  Tonight he messages again. ""Thanks for seeing me, this morning made my day."" I replied ""Yea, lets not do the weird Walmart thing again, it made me feel icky and uncomfortable. I don't know when I'll be interested in meeting up again.""

He's now blasting me in the HS group on fb (ironic...HS behavior in a HS group) and over messenger. Saying that I'm totally off base and overreacting and being a bitch to someone who just wanted to catch up with a friend. Some people are telling me that is ""just how he is"" and I need to say sorry for offending him.

I live between M√ºnchen and Starnberg and would love to meet someone nearby who‚Äôs ready for something real. Life feels more meaningful when it's shared with the right person. And, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping to find.

I‚Äôm tall (187 cm), with dark hair and blue eyes. I‚Äôve got a strong build with a bit of softness in the middle. I‚Äôm also on the hairier side, just being honest right from the start. :)

I enjoy the simple things: quiet walks in nature, slow mornings, good food, and spending time with people who make me feel at ease. I speak English, German, and Turkish. I‚Äôm into anime, manga, and board games. So yes, you could say that I‚Äôm a bit nerdy.

What matters most to me is connection, both emotional and physical. I usually feel that spark more with women who are naturally slim, fit, or have an average build. That‚Äôs just me being honest about what I‚Äôm drawn to, not trying to be selective.

There‚Äôs one thing I want to be upfront about: I‚Äôd love to have a child of my own one day. I know that‚Äôs a big thing to share early, but I think it‚Äôs important to speak from the heart.

I‚Äôm not looking for endless texting or something long-distance. I‚Äôd much rather meet in person, have a coffee or tea, take a walk, and see how we vibe.

There‚Äôs a photo on my profile if you'd like to put a face to the words. And if something here speaks to you, I‚Äôd genuinely love to hear from you. :)",1,1750576908.0,MeetPeople,0,1.0,False

1lhi1fj,https://i.redd.it/tqrmve7qjf8f1.jpeg,Honest Experiences with the Sage Oracle Touch (Refurb),"Just wanted to share my experience with the Sage Oracle Touch after two years of ownership. This was my first ‚Äúserious‚Äù coffee machine, which I bought used/refurbished when it was already two years old.

As a complete beginner at the time, I was genuinely impressed at how easy it was to start producing caf√©-quality espresso and milk drinks straight out of the box. With minimal reading or training, the machine delivered great results, and the built-in automation meant very little dialing in was required. The only real variable I had to adjust was grind size, which is cleverly linked to shot timing, so you don‚Äôt need to become a barista to get solid results. We drink 2-3 flat whites a day and the quality has always been at least as good if not better than most coffee shops in town. 

Unfortunately, about a year in, the internal grinder motor disengaged. I tried to repair it myself but quickly realised the internals were far too complex due to the level of automation. I spoke to a couple of local espresso repair specialists, but none of them were willing to touch it- most felt it was too complicated and had too much that could go wrong. There are a couple of centres in the UK that will repair it, but quoted prices started at ¬£350-500.

After doing some research, I decided to buy a Niche Zero grinder. While it‚Äôs undeniably more manual than the Oracle Touch‚Äôs built-in grind/dose/tamp system, I‚Äôm actually enjoying the process more now and the espresso I‚Äôm making is more consistent and easier to fine tune. At the moment, I‚Äôm still using the Niche Zero alongside the Oracle Touch, and it‚Äôs working well. That said, I‚Äôm considering upgrading to something like the Profitec Pro 400 or Ride in the next year (open to suggestions in the ¬£1-2k range!).

Summary:
The Oracle Touch is a great machine for anyone who wants to make high-quality coffee at home without spending hours learning the ins and outs of espresso. If you‚Äôre happy with a more hands-off approach and want 4‚Äì6 caf√©-level espressos or milk drinks a day, it‚Äôs ideal. However, if you suspect you‚Äôll want to dive deeper into espresso technique, or enjoy the tinkering and control, it might not be the best long-term fit. Also, buying refurbished means you don‚Äôt get the two-year manufacturer warranty which, combined with its complexity and ¬£2,000+ price tag, raises some concerns about long-term reliability.",2,1750576845.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Hi all. I‚Äôm 27F with low ovarian reserve. My husband (30M) is paralyzed from the chest down (wheelchair user for 20+ years) and can‚Äôt ejaculate due to his spinal injury. We‚Äôre trying IVF with support from Maven + a fertility clinic.

It‚Äôs been over 6 months, and we haven‚Äôt even started injections yet. A lot of time was lost because male fertility care was under different insurance, which took about a month to approve. Sperm retrieval still hasn‚Äôt happened.

I was told I should have ~15 follicles at my age, but only had 7. That hit hard. I also have high cholesterol, I‚Äôm prediabetic, and I used to have PCOS, but was recently told I don‚Äôt anymore.

I recently stopped taking Duloxetine because of chest pains, dizziness, and head spins.

My health issues caused me to miss work regularly, and I was eventually let go. Now that I‚Äôm not working, I‚Äôm trying to focus fully on fixing these health and fertility issues.

I‚Äôve made major lifestyle changes ‚Äî quit smoking, vaping, coffee, and even rice ‚Äî It‚Äôs so frustrating to do so much and still feel stuck.

Has anyone else:

Had delays with Maven?
Gone through IVF with a paralyzed partner?
Faced insurance hold-ups for male fertility?
Had low follicle count at a young age?
Found a good urologist for spinal cord injury?
Reversed PCOS but still had low egg count?
Any advice or support would mean the world. Feeling frustrated, anxious, and emotionally worn out.

Im in the 3rd world. Lots of people are very VERY bad at using phones and any tech. 

The people i find for working at a coffee shop (that dont steal, which is common here) are illiterate (meaning can't read other than numbers and some common words)

So I'd appreciate it if the software is as easy to use as possible.

I'm genuinely not trying to mock or belittle people, but people are illiterate here, and that's just reality.

I dont mind if it requires some complicated setting up from me for the workers as im a nerd and often dive into discovering janky stuff.

Hope your doing well and constantly battling with your problems as a Queen does. I wish and pray to the Almighty that you smile no matter where you are and he gives you good health and prosperity. 

So yesterday loneliness was at peak and i after finishing my exam was watching ""Jerry Maguire"" it was an incredibly good movie, it also might have triggered the emotions but I'd take it. I decided to take a walk beside the sea, the breeze wasn't cold but good enough to stand and hear the soothing sound of waves. I walked for an hour or so and then decided to visit the Scientific Center beside it. Seeing kids play, people enjoying their coffees at the cafes, couples hanging around for movies or dates etc. kinda went beyond the threshold, im happy for all of them who have found love or their half who complete them. 

A quote by Margaret Atwood kept swirling around my mind the entire time"" The desire to be loved is the last illusion. Give it up and you will be free.""

 It sounds easy  to give up but will there be someone who will acknowledge my love or will it just exist and fade away. Either way i shall perish with it when the grim reaper comes for me.

The feeling when you have your other half, who is your best friend, who understands you in every situation and you have the freedom to talk to them just like you talk to yourself. I'd stare into her eyes and be lost. I'd write poems about you in my journal and take it away when i shall lie in my grave. I'd engrave a tattoo of loyalty in our hands, a bond till death parts us and in the hereafter.

I won't let anyone comes between us, no racism, no caste difference and no other difference which creates a disbalance between us. 

Nevertheless you might not even exist for me but if you do, i hope these find you.

She faked an allergic reaction, and my three brothers‚Äîmy own flesh and blood‚Äîlocked me in the pitch-black cellar, sealing the door with chains as if I were some dangerous criminal.  
  
I slammed my fists against the heavy door, my strength already fading. ""Please! Let me out! I didn't do anything!""  
  
Alexander, my eldest brother‚Äîthe ruthless business tycoon‚Äîstood just beyond the door, his voice sharp as ice.  
  
""Save the dramatics, Evelyn. It's bad enough you torment Sophia constantly, but deliberately feeding her seafood when you knew she was allergic? What kind of monster does that? Stay there and reflect on your actions.""  
  
Nathaniel, the rising music sensation with that ever-present smirk, scoffed. ""Still playing innocent? Pathetic. No one's buying it.""  
  
Benjamin, the so-called artistic prodigy, sneered. ""Vile as always. Maybe a few days in the dark will finally knock some sense into you.""  
  
They didn‚Äôt wait for my response. Instead, they carried Sophia‚Äîpale, trembling, the perfect picture of fragility‚Äîto the car and sped off to the hospital.  
  
Three days passed before they returned.  
  
I was still there‚Äîor at least, what was left of me. A ghost, watching silently as they walked back into the house, Sophia cradled between them like a delicate porcelain doll.  
  
Alexander smiled down at her, his voice softer than I‚Äôd ever heard it. ""You're so strong, Sophia. I'm just glad we got you to the hospital in time.""  
  
Nathaniel nodded, his usual arrogance replaced with rare tenderness. ""You're recovering so fast. It's a relief.""  
  
Benjamin, ever the devoted one, handed her a tray of food. ""The doctor said you need to eat well. This will help you regain your strength.""  
  
Meanwhile, a maid hovered nervously at the edge of the room, twisting her apron in her hands. Finally, she spoke up.  
  
""Um‚Ä¶ Young Masters, Miss Evelyn hasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ made a sound from the cellar in three days.""  
  
Alexander barely spared her a glance. ""And?"" He waved a dismissive hand. ""Today is a happy day. Sophia‚Äôs home. Don‚Äôt ruin it by bringing up Evelyn.""  
  
The maid hesitated but didn‚Äôt push further. Nathaniel shot her a sharp glare. ""Don‚Äôt waste our time. Evelyn‚Äôs probably just throwing another tantrum.""  
  
Benjamin scoffed. ""She‚Äôs just mad she got caught. Serves her right.""  
  
Nathaniel smirked. ""Seriously, who plans an entire seafood feast knowing someone‚Äôs allergic? That‚Äôs pure evil.""  
  
""And here I thought she was finally trying to make peace with Sophia,"" Benjamin added with a bitter laugh. ""Guess I gave her too much credit.""  
  
Sophia, ever the saint, clutched Alexander‚Äôs sleeve with trembling fingers, her voice soft and hesitant.  
  
""Evelyn‚Äôs been locked up for so long‚Ä¶ because of me. What if she‚Äôs angry when she gets out?""  
  
Alexander immediately turned to her, his expression hardening. ""Don‚Äôt worry about her, Sophia. Evelyn‚Äôs gotten away with too much for too long. She needed this. Maybe now she‚Äôll learn to treat you with respect.""  
  
As he spoke, he pulled out his phone, scrolling through our last messages. His jaw tightened. ""Not one call. Not one text. She hasn‚Äôt even asked about you.""  
  
Sophia sniffled, tears glistening in her wide, innocent eyes. ""I never wanted to cause trouble. I just wanted to spend time with her. I didn‚Äôt mean to take anything from her‚Ä¶""  
  
Alexander sighed, stroking her hair like a doting father. ""You‚Äôre too good for her, Sophia. She doesn‚Äôt deserve your kindness.""  
  
Nathaniel sneered, his voice dripping with disdain. ""She‚Äôs the type who‚Äôd betray her own family just for attention. Disgusting.""  
  
Benjamin crossed his arms, his expression dark. ""If she doesn‚Äôt come crawling out begging for forgiveness, I‚Äôll throw her out myself.""  
  
I stood there, unseen, unheard, listening with a bitter smile.  
  
My brothers had no idea.  
  
Evelyn wasn‚Äôt sulking in that cellar.  
  
She was already gone.  
  
Chapter 2Ever since our parents died, my three older brothers had made me their entire universe. I was their everything.  
  
One afternoon, I casually mentioned wanting a friend my own age. By sunset the next day, they had gone to an orphanage and returned with Sophia, introducing her as my stepsister.  
  
At first, I welcomed Sophia with open arms, thrilled to finally have someone to share my life with. But that joy twisted into something darker. In front of my brothers, she played the perfect, innocent angel‚Äîwhile behind their backs, she spun lies, framing me for things I never did. Slowly, their love for me turned to suspicion, then to cold disdain.  
  
And now, here I was‚Äîlocked inside a cramped, airless cellar, accused of triggering Sophia‚Äôs allergic reaction.  
  
I slammed my fists against the heavy door until my knuckles throbbed, screaming until my voice cracked. ""Let me out! I didn‚Äôt do anything!""  
  
But the only replies were their icy, merciless voices from the other side.  
  
""Enough, Evelyn,"" Alexander, the eldest, snapped. ""You‚Äôve caused enough damage. Do you even realize what could‚Äôve happened to Sophia? You could‚Äôve killed her!""  
  
Nathaniel‚Äôs voice, usually so composed, was sharp with fury. ""We‚Äôve been too lenient with you. That‚Äôs why you think you can keep pulling these stunts. Maybe a few days in there will finally teach you some discipline.""  
  
Benjamin‚Äôs words cut like a knife. ""You always play the victim, Evelyn. But this time, you‚Äôve crossed a line.""  
  
The metallic clink of chains echoed as Nathaniel secured the door, followed by the scrape of heavy furniture being shoved against it. My stomach dropped.  
  
The air in the cellar grew thinner with every passing minute. My vision blurred, and I collapsed onto the cold floor, gasping for breath.  
  
Then‚Äîdarkness swallowed me whole.  
  
When I opened my eyes again, I wasn‚Äôt inside my body anymore. I was‚Ä¶ floating. Watching.  
  
I found myself in the living room of our mansion. My brothers were gathered around Sophia, doting on her as if she were made of glass.  
  
Alexander sat beside her, his voice dripping with affection. ""You‚Äôre incredible, Sophia. You‚Äôve recovered so quickly.""  
  
Nathaniel nodded, his worry etched across his face. ""You had us terrified. It‚Äôs a relief to see you looking better.""  
  
Benjamin handed her a steaming cup of tea, his tone gentle. ""The doctor said rest and proper nutrition are key. You need to regain your strength.""  
  
Sophia, ever the picture of fragile innocence, tugged on Alexander‚Äôs sleeve and gazed up at him with watery eyes. ""Alexander, please don‚Äôt be angry with Evelyn. It‚Äôs my fault. I‚Äôm too weak. I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure she didn‚Äôt mean to hurt me.""  
  
Alexander‚Äôs expression hardened instantly. ""Don‚Äôt defend her, Sophia. She‚Äôs selfish and reckless. We‚Äôve indulged her for far too long.""  
  
Nathaniel‚Äôs jaw clenched, his anger barely contained. ""She‚Äôs always been jealous and spiteful. And now? Now she‚Äôs crossed a dangerous line.""  
  
Sophia lowered her head, letting her hair curtain her face as if hiding tears. ""I don‚Äôt want to cause trouble, but‚Ä¶"" She hesitated, then lifted her sleeve, revealing faint red marks on her skin. ""I‚Äôm fine, really. It doesn‚Äôt even hurt anymore.""  
  
Benjamin‚Äôs eyes darkened as he traced the marks with his fingers. ""Does it still sting?""  
  
""No,"" Sophia whispered, shaking her head, her voice trembling just enough to sound convincing. ""I‚Äôll be okay.""  
  
Nathaniel exploded. ""Okay? She could‚Äôve killed you, Sophia! And Evelyn hasn‚Äôt even tried to check on you‚Äîno call, no message. She doesn‚Äôt care at all!""  
  
Alexander slammed his phone onto the coffee table. ""Bring her here. Now. Drag her out if you have to‚ÄîI want her on her knees, begging for Sophia‚Äôs forgiveness.""  
  
Benjamin crossed his arms, his tone glacial. ""She‚Äôs been pampered for too long. It‚Äôs time she learned actions have consequences.""  
  
The servants exchanged uneasy glances but didn‚Äôt dare disobey.  
  
""Move!"" Alexander barked. ""And bring the cane. If Evelyn won‚Äôt show remorse, maybe pain will teach her a lesson.""  
  
""She poisoned Sophia!"" Nathaniel roared. ""It‚Äôs time someone put her in her place.""  
  
I hovered there, invisible, as the servants scrambled to obey. My chest burned with a bitterness I couldn‚Äôt voice.  
  
My brothers had condemned me without a shred of evidence. They hadn‚Äôt even tried to uncover the truth.  
  
The sister they claimed to love was gone‚Äîdestroyed by their blind devotion to Sophia.

My partner and I will be moving to Phuket for 6 months.  
We intend on staying at home to work and going to the condo gym (or my partner goes to an external gym). We won't be drinking, smoking, partying aside from the occasional cafe coffee date.

I eat roughly 1900 calories and he eats 2,500 calories.  
Our meals are likely going to be:

* protein: chicken breasts, chicken thighs from makro (frozen, i heard they are the cheapest in bulk)
* protein: eggs (trays from market)
* carbs: sweet potato, normal potato, pumpkin (market)
* veg: cabbage, red cabbage (make saukraut) carrot, onion, tomato, other vegetables (market)
* fruits: papaya, banana, any kind of fruit (market)
* fats: not sure... nuts are likely to be expensive
* other things we might need from supermarkets: salt, spices, oil, miso paste and greek yoghurt (for me, if possible, depending on price), coffee powder (if we can find a moka pot or something that is not expensive)

  
rough meal plan:

* morning: tea, coffee
* HIS lunch: 5-6 eggs, chicken maybe, veggies
* HER lunch: 2-3 eggs, saukraut, yoghurt, miso soup
* snack: fruits
* dinner: chicken (or fish/beef depending), veggies, starchy veggie (stir fry everything together with spices)

questions:

1. what is the rough food costs per month?

I'm giving this another go looking for a genuine long-term connection so you may have seen this before. Looking for that person to spend time with, that person to say good morning and good night to, that person to send dumb silly messages to throughout the day just because. I'm a bit of a hopeless romantic on top of all this so it makes for quite a combo. Now a bit about me with a mix of...what I'm sort of looking for too?

* I'm 26 and will turn 27 this year. Genetics has given me some gray hair though...not sure how I feel about it totally yet.
* I stand at a very tall, very impressive 5'5. That means I am the perfect height for sinks or something...I don't know exactly, but I'm sure it is perfect for something! Either way, you can wear heels and be taller if you like, I have no qualms about this.
* Hobby-wise been doing more hiking lately, trying to hit the gym more, and debating whether or not greek yogurt is actually worth it!
* I also love going on random drives so someone that enjoys being a passenger princess late at night to get ice cream or boba or even coffee and bread is a bonus. I'm a mix of outdoorsy and indoors. Occasionally down to club, more down to bar hop or wine taste or breweries. Also down to stay home and read or watch a show and try and figure out why we thought it might be good when it disappoints us!
* I'm everything from serious to sweet to goofy to sassy and sarcastic. I match energies more than anything and choose my attitude towards things appropriately. I definitely enjoy sharing my day a little bit with updates through it too, but that's just part of my love language I think.
* I'm single, monogamous, no children yet (definitely lean towards wanting them), and unless busy with work, reply fast. You do not need to reply quick, I just do because my work has a lot of busy for 20 and not busy for 5 while things test and such.
* If you do game a bit, always a bonus since I do wish I had someone to play It Takes Two with or even Portal 2! Little game night dates are always fun in my book!

If you think we might be a match or want to learn more and explore to see how things go, definitely drop a line and introduce yourself. It is starting to come up to the time I usually sleep here so I might not reply till morning so...good night <3 I hope to talk to you in the morning if I don't see your message!

My wife is the weekday opener, all 5 days. She works a bartending job Saturdays till close. She doesn‚Äôt clock out till 4am. 
The coworker often goes to the bar where my wife works and gets piss drunk during the week. She also had a 10yr old kid. 
The coworker recently told their coffee shop manager that she can‚Äôt open Sundays anymore because she wants to spend time with her daughter. 

HERE‚ÄôS THE INFURIATING PART. My wife and I speculated she only said that because she wants to get drunk Saturday nights. And we were right. The coffee shop boss had no one to cover the Sunday morning so she asked my wife. My wife is a sweet angel and said yes, but this meant she wouldn‚Äôt be able to come home after closing at the bar. She would have to sleep in her car outside of the coffee shop to start opening by 5:30am. 
 THE COWORKER SHOWED UP THE BAR TODAY TO  DRINK AND HAD THE AUDACITY TO ASK MY WIFE IF SHE COULD SLEEP OVER AT OUR HOUSE TONIGHT. My wife being the sweet angel she is called me to let me know about it and gave the coworker my number to call me later. 
I PUT MY PHONE ON DO NOT DISTURB. I knew the thing about spending time with her daughter was bullshit and I refuse to let her pull this shit. She should go home piss drunk to the daughter she‚Äôs suppose to spend time with.

Im in the 3rd world. Lots of people are very VERY bad at using phones and any tech. 

The people i find for working at a coffee shop (that dont steal, which is common here) are illiterate (meaning can't read other than numbers and some common words)

So I'd appreciate it if the software is as easy to use as possible.

I'm genuinely not trying to mock or belittle people, but people are illiterate here, and that's just reality.

I dont mind if it requires some complicated setting up from me for the workers as im a nerd and often dive into discovering janky stuff.

Example:
	‚Ä¢	Expression: [üë§(ü§ùüë§)]‚û°Ô∏è[üè†(üçΩÔ∏è)]
	‚Ä¢	Interpretation: ""People together go to a house for a meal.""
Design Considerations:
	‚Ä¢	Clarity: Helps in parsing complex statements by visually separating components.

Rule: Modifiers are placed before or after the core symbol depending on their function and emphasis.
Placement Guidelines:
	‚Ä¢	Temporal Modifiers: Before the action or event symbol.
	‚Ä¢	Intensity Modifiers: Directly preceding the emotion or descriptive symbol.
	‚Ä¢	Contextual Modifiers: Surrounding or enclosing the core symbols.
	‚Ä¢	Quantity Modifiers: Immediately before the object symbol.
Example:
	‚Ä¢	Expression: ‚è≥üë§üî•üò†‚û°Ô∏è2Ô∏è‚É£üë•
	‚Ä¢	Interpretation: ""Previously, the person was very angry at two people.""
Design Considerations:
	‚Ä¢	Standardization: Consistent placement aids in quick comprehension.
	‚Ä¢	Flexibility: Allows rearrangement for emphasis where necessary.

5.5 Contextual Adaptation
Rule: Symbols can adapt their meaning based on surrounding symbols and established context within the conversation.
Example:
	‚Ä¢	Context: Discussing environmental issues.
	‚Ä¢	Expression: üå≥üìà
	‚Ä¢	Interpretation: ""Increase in forests/reforestation.""
Design Considerations:
	‚Ä¢	Dynamic Meaning: Enables symbols to be versatile and context-sensitive.

I‚Äôve been planning an Episode story and I‚Äôd love to know if it‚Äôs something readers here would actually be into before I start directing! Here‚Äôs the vision:

MC: You play Sophie (or whatever you want to name her),¬† the first person in your entire family to go to university. It‚Äôs supposed to be this big moment: your mum is crying happy tears, your sister‚Äôs filming everything, and you‚Äôre meant to be excited... but it feels off.

Context: You‚Äôre studying Politics & Law - a choice your late father would‚Äôve been proud of - but deep down, all you‚Äôve ever wanted to do is be an author. Creative writing is your dream, but you switched your major last minute to please your family.¬†

LI 1: You also have this hometown crush, Mason, who doubles as a close, childhood friend. You text every night, he encourages your dreams. You feel fiercely protective of his love life, even if you‚Äôve never officially dated.

LI 2: And then you meet Hunter, a campus barista-slash-dorm RA who‚Äôs smart, thoughtful, and a lot more emotionally supportive than Mason ever was. He doesn‚Äôt flirt right away because he‚Äôs scared of being friend-zoned‚Ä¶ but your slow-burn friendship may lead to something more.

It‚Äôs basically:

* A slow-burn campus romance
* A girl torn between expectations and her true self
* Loyalty vs. temptation
* Coffee, comfort, and quiet emotional drama
* Bonus: a bubbly, supportive best friend (Tilly!) who‚Äôs secretly going through her own identity crisis too
* And, of course, all the choices you make really matter: you will be able to choose between the two at the end or you may only be able to get one depending on how you act  

I'm aiming for more grounded drama and subtle romantic tension - not insta-love or clich√© makeovers. Think Normal People meets Gilmore Girls. Would you read something like this? Is there anything you‚Äôd want to see more of in a story like this? Open to feedback, questions, or even collab ideas!

# Best custom Growlers 2025: Find Your Perfect Beer Carrier

The custom growler: more then just a container for beer, it‚Äôs a statement piece, a conversation starter, and a personalized way to enjoy your favorite craft brews. In 2025, the market is brimming with options, ranging from sleek stainless steel designs to rustic ceramic masterpieces. This guide will help you navigate the landscape and find the perfect custom growler to suit your needs and style, whether you're heading to a tailgate, a picnic, or simply stocking up on beer to enjoy at home.

## Key Features Analysis

The modern custom growler boasts a range of features designed to keep your beer fresh, secure, and stylish. Understanding these key specifications will help you make an informed decision.

**Material:** The most common materials are stainless steel, glass, and ceramic.

Stainless steel growlers are favored for their durability and ability to maintain beer temperature. High-quality stainless steel, like 18/8 food-grade stainless steel, is rust-resistant and won't impart any unwanted flavors to your beer. Many stainless steel growlers are also vacuum-insulated, further enhancing their ability to keep beer cold for extended periods, often up to 24 hours or more.

Glass growlers offer a classic aesthetic and allow you to see the level of beer remaining. They are generally less expensive than stainless steel options but are also more prone to breakage and don't insulate as well. Dark glass can help protect beer from light exposure, which can lead to skunking.

Ceramic growlers blend style and functionality, often featuring intricate designs and unique glazes. While they can help maintain temperature to some extent, they are also susceptible to breakage and may require more careful handling. The thick walls of ceramic can help block out light, preserving the beer's flavor.**Closure Type:** The closure system is critical for maintaining carbonation and preventing leaks.

Swing-top closures, also known as flip-top or Grolsch-style closures, are a popular choice for their ease of use and reliable seal. These closures feature a rubber gasket that presses against the growler's neck, creating an airtight seal. The quality of the gasket is crucial for preventing leaks and maintaining carbonation.

Screw-top closures, typically made of stainless steel or plastic, offer a secure and leak-proof seal, especially when paired with a rubber or silicone gasket. These closures often feature a thread design that ensures a tight fit, minimizing the risk of beer going flat.

Cap-style closures,similar to those found on beer bottles,provide a conventional look and feel. These closures require a bottle opener and offer a reliable seal when properly applied. However, they are not reusable in the same way as swing-top or screw-top closures.

**Size and capacity:** Growlers come in various sizes, with the standard being 64 ounces (half-gallon) and 32 ounces (half-growler or howler).

64-ounce growlers are the most common size, offering a generous amount of beer for sharing or enjoying over a few days. This size is ideal for those who frequently refill their growlers and want to maximize their beer supply.

32-ounce growlers, or howlers, are a smaller, more portable option perfect for single servings or for sampling multiple beers from different breweries. Their compact size makes them easy to carry in a backpack or cooler.Smaller growlers, such as 16-ounce or even pint-sized options, are also available for individual servings or as novelty items. These sizes are less common but can be convenient for specific situations.

**Customization Options:** The ability to personalize a growler is a major draw for many buyers.

Engraving, either laser or rotary, allows for precise and permanent designs, including names, logos, and custom artwork. Laser engraving is particularly well-suited for stainless steel growlers, creating a sleek and modern look.

Screen printing is a cost-effective option for adding logos or designs in bulk, often used for brewery merchandise or promotional items. The ink is applied directly to the growler's surface, creating a durable and vibrant print.Full-wrap printing allows for complete customization of the growler's exterior, enabling intricate and eye-catching designs. This method is typically used on stainless steel growlers and offers virtually unlimited design possibilities.

**Insulation:** Insulation technology is meaningful for keeping beer at the optimal consumption temperature.

Vacuum insulation is a common method used with double-walled stainless steel growlers. This creates a thermal barrier that prevents heat transfer, keeping beer cold for extended periods.

Foam insulation, often found in plastic or some stainless steel growlers, provides a basic level of insulation. While not as effective as vacuum insulation, it can definitely help maintain beer temperature for a shorter duration.

No insulation is standard in glass and ceramic growlers. It does not provide additional temperature contol and the beer is more susceptible to temperature fluctuation based on the ambient temperature.

## Core Benefits

A custom growler offers various benefits beyond simply transporting beer. It's a way to support local breweries, reduce waste, and enjoy fresh beer in style.

**Supporting Local Breweries:** Filling a growler directly from a brewery allows you to enjoy their freshest offerings and directly support their business.This promotes the local craft beer scene and helps breweries thrive. Many breweries offer growler fill discounts,making it an economical way to enjoy their beer.

**Reducing waste:** Growlers are a reusable alternative to cans and bottles,significantly reducing waste and promoting environmental sustainability.By refilling your growler, you contribute to a circular economy and minimize your carbon footprint. Over time, the environmental impact of using a growler far outweighs the production impact.

**Enjoying Fresh Beer:** Growlers allow you to take home draft beer, which is often fresher and has a better flavor profile than packaged beer. Refilling your growler directly from the tap ensures that you are getting the beer at its peak flavor and aroma. This is particularly important for hoppy beers, which can lose their aroma over time.

**Personal Expression:** Custom growlers allow you to showcase your personality and style. Whether you choose a sleek stainless steel design with a laser-engraved logo or a rustic ceramic growler with a hand-painted design, your growler becomes a unique statement piece.

**Convenience and portability:** Growlers provide a convenient way to transport beer to parties, picnics, or other gatherings. Their sturdy construction and secure closures prevent leaks,ensuring that your beer arrives safely at its destination. The handle makes it easy to carry.

## FAQs Section

**How long will beer stay fresh in a growler?**
Generally, beer will stay fresh in a properly sealed growler for 1-3 days after filling. The key to maintaining freshness is minimizing air exposure and keeping the growler cold. For optimal results, drink the beer within 24 hours of filling.

**How do I clean my growler?**
Rinse the growler thoroughly with warm water promptly after use. Avoid using harsh soaps or detergents, as they can leave a residue that affects the beer's flavor. For a deeper clean,use a growler cleaning tablet or a mixture of baking soda and water. Be sure to rinse thoroughly and allow the growler to air dry entirely upside down before storing.

**Can I fill my growler with any type of beverage?**
While growlers are primarily intended for beer, they can also be used to transport other beverages like kombucha, cider, or even cold-brewed coffee. However, it's essential to clean the growler thoroughly between different beverages to prevent flavor contamination. Certain beverages may also leave a residue or stain.

**Are there any restrictions on where I can take a filled growler?**
Regulations regarding open containers vary by jurisdiction. It's crucial to check local laws and regulations before transporting a filled growler in your car or bringing it to a public event. Some areas may require the growler to be sealed and transported in the trunk of your vehicle.

A quick check of the internet has not yielded great solutions for me. My journey: I went the Moka pot route, then switched to Venus 2-cup, tried a couple different beans. I recently got a Cafelat Robot with mittens and knock box and a Kingrinder 2 for espresso. I have an old blade grinder from when they were considered good that I use for ""whatever"" beans to try out new beans in the Venus to decide if I want to make espresso with them. I have a French press and pour over equipment for my guests who may want to make their own; some bring their own coffee. I also use a Capresso burr grinder which works great for pour overs and the medium roast Arabica I use for that. I didn't expect this to start becoming such a thing but now that it has I need to better organize. I turned to James Hoffman and sent in an idea for him to design a home barista station that could accommodate all of this on a countertop (including a bean station so I can try out new selections) but then I saw his video which I have linked to here: [https://youtu.be/epIgulaBryA?si=rOXN66xFPKyrZNDt](https://youtu.be/epIgulaBryA?si=rOXN66xFPKyrZNDt) It is hilarious but made me think he probably will not do a video on making a home barista station so I'm reaching out looking for ideas.",0,1750573248.0,CafelatRobot,0,0.5,False

They're of the type that find it cute that the cat bought them a present üò° (Its had 2 so far) 

I set the dog after it but it hasn't learnt and returns

My crow family and ducks all use the front garden and now the nights are lighter they're coming earlier and I can't always be there 

Has anyone had any luck with ultrasonic cat scarers? I can't use the organic repellant (coffee/citrus/curry) as we have hedgehogs that visit and they dislike it too

TL/DR need a cat repeller that's safe for hedgehogs and birds
