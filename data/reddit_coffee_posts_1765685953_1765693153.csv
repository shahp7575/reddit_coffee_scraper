Consolidation is the name of the game today, with a massive mining merger getting the green light and Intel making a billion-dollar play to catch up in the AI race.

**Teck Resources (TECK)** has received final court approval to merge with Anglo American, creating the new **Anglo Teck Group**, where Anglo shareholders will hold the majority stake (62.4%). Meanwhile, **Intel (INTC)** is reportedly in late-stage talks to acquire AI chip innovator SambaNova Systems for roughly **$1.6 billion**. In aerospace, **Boeing (BA)** is showing resilience, securing 164 gross orders in November valued at $17 billion, driven largely by wide-body demand. Conversely, **Coca-Cola (KO)** faces a write-down reality check, nearing a deal to sell Costa Coffee for £2 billion—significantly less than the £3.9 billion it paid.

The formation of Anglo Teck Group creates a new heavyweight in the materials sector, likely aimed at optimizing global supply chains. For Intel, the SambaNova acquisition signals an aggressive push to capture AI market share and diversify beyond legacy architecture, though execution risks remain. Boeing's strong November numbers suggest airline confidence is returning to the wide-body market despite broader industry supply chain constraints.

Elsewhere, the energy sector remains robust as **Diamond Offshore (DNOW)** posted record Q3 revenue of $634 million (+4.6% YoY). On the regulatory front, **Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)** secured FDA approval for its prostate cancer drug AKEEGA, while **Synopsys (SNPS)** and **James Hardie (JHX)** face headwinds from new securities fraud lawsuits.

Do you think Intel's $1.6B bet on SambaNova is enough to make them a contender against current AI chip leaders, or is it too little too late?

Konsolidierung ist heute das Stichwort: Eine riesige Fusion im Bergbausektor erhält grünes Licht und Intel geht mit einem Milliardendeal ins Rennen, um im KI-Markt aufzuholen.

**Teck Resources (TECK)** hat die endgültige gerichtliche Genehmigung zur Fusion mit Anglo American erhalten. Daraus entsteht die neue **Anglo Teck Group**, bei der die Aktionäre von Anglo den Mehrheitsanteil (62,4%) halten werden. Unterdessen befindet sich **Intel (INTC)** Berichten zufolge in fortgeschrittenen Gesprächen über die Übernahme des KI-Chip-Innovators SambaNova Systems für rund **1,6 Milliarden US-Dollar**. In der Luftfahrtbranche zeigt sich **Boeing (BA)** widerstandsfähig: Im November wurden 164 Bruttobestellungen im Wert von $17 Milliarden verbucht, angetrieben vor allem durch die starke Nachfrage nach Großraumflugzeugen. Im Gegensatz dazu steht **Coca-Cola (KO)** vor einer schmerzhaften Abschreibung und steht kurz davor, Costa Coffee für £2 Milliarden zu verkaufen—deutlich weniger als die £3,9 Milliarden, die ursprünglich gezahlt wurden.

Die Gründung der Anglo Teck Group schafft einen neuen Schwergewichtigen im Materialsektor, offenbar mit dem Ziel, globale Lieferketten zu optimieren. Für Intel signalisiert die Übernahme von SambaNova eine aggressive Expansion im KI-Markt und eine Diversifizierung über traditionelle Architekturen hinaus, auch wenn erhebliche Umsetzungsrisiken bestehen. Die starken Novemberzahlen von Boeing deuten darauf hin, dass das Vertrauen der Fluggesellschaften in den Markt für Großraumflugzeuge zurückkehrt, trotz anhaltender Probleme in den Lieferketten der Branche.

Auch der Energiesektor bleibt robust: **Diamond Offshore (DNOW)** meldet einen Rekordumsatz im 3. Quartal von 634 Millionen Dollar (+4,6% im Jahresvergleich). Auf regulatorischer Seite hat **Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)** die FDA-Zulassung für sein Prostatakrebsmedikament AKEEGA erhalten. Gleichzeitig sehen sich **Synopsys (SNPS)** und **James Hardie (JHX)** mit neuen Wertpapierklagen wegen Betrugs konfrontiert.

Glaubt ihr, dass Intels Wette von $1,6 Mrd. auf SambaNova ausreicht, um im KI-Chip-Markt wirklich mitzuspielen, oder kommt der Schritt zu spät?

I want to use the effect where you apply the echo, fade out, then fade in:out quickly 3-4 times before releasing the effects and letting the song play.

Every time I try this my fading in/out always sounds distorted and never sounds as clean as when I see these pro DJs do it. Are there any considerations that need to be made before applying echo and timing the fade in/out. I keep all the EQs on during my echos btw.

For context I’m working on a FLX 400

====================



*I blinked and looked around, confused. My mouth felt strangely hollow and empty. I was in an old wooden house, and I was knelt upon an old kneeler that stung my legs and forced me to straighten my back. The incoherent voice of the man next to me became drowned out by the incessant buzzing of flies. I turned to see him, exhausted, my heart pounding. There, eyes red from sleep deprivation with dark heavy bags beneath them, was a broken man. He wore disgusting white clothes, stained brown and red. His hair was knotted and crusted with dirt, his fingernails long and cracked. His lips were dried and white. His entire figure could have been compared to a sheet of paper—through his thin shirt I could see his entire rib cage, and protruding from his loose pants were his hip bones. His hands were folded hopefully on the top of the kneeler, his eyes gazing up at the hand-made crucifix of the Lord, hung crookedly from a rusted nail.*

*“Oh Lord God,” the man said, his voice hoarse and dried. “Hear my prayer. Save my wife from the plague that has fallen upon her! Remember your promise to us, oh gracious Lord! You promise deliverance, safety, and security in this new land! I have done everything you have asked of me! I have given you what you want! Is my soul not enough? What more could you want, oh gracious God? Please! Hear my cry, and save my wife. May you make her strong again!”*

*That was all the man said, repeatedly, without pause. The longer I stayed next to him, the more my stomach burned. My mind followed. Tempted by the buzzing of the flies around us, I took a look around the room. It was a cabin, one that was divided in half by a wall. Uncleaned cast-iron pans and cooking pots lined with rotting food were piled in a grimy tub. The windows were frosted over from the raging blizzard outside, the log walls creaking as the flames in the lanterns swayed back and forth, pulsating with the draft leaking through the foundation. And then, of course, was that horrible depiction of Christ on the cross. Unlike the art done by professional sculptors and craftsmen, this render of the agonizing scene was a monstrosity. The arms were elongated and stretched far out, farther than they should have been. The legs were perfectly straight, and His back arched forward, as if to cry out in eternal pain. On His mangled head, was a crude recreation of the crown of thrones. The thrones were large, like swords piercing his forehead as He gazed down, not up, at the man and I, those soulless eyes never ceasing their stare.*

*At some point I had begun to drift back asleep, but I was awoken by the strong grip of a man grabbing hold of the back of my neck. His cold hand sent waves of chills rushing down my spine. He grabbed my chin and corked my head to face him, a burning rage blazing in his sunken orbs. “What do you think you’re doing?” he asked, almost shocked by my fatigue. “Do you think you can get rest? That you can sleep? NO! You’re going to kneel with me and you’re going to pray to God that He doesn’t take your mother away, you hear? Do you want her to die? Do you want her to be taken away from us? After all our praying? No! I will not allow her to die! She will live! So, pray with me for once in your miserable life! Pray with me!”*

*“Damn you, Westley, can you just let the Lord take me?” The desperate voice came from the room down the hall, where the flies seemed to be most prominent. It was followed by a series of strangled wheezes and moans of agony, then a silence that was more horrifying than the old man’s response.*

*“You shut your mouth you ungrateful bitch!” he boomed, a coughing fit ensuing. “I am saving your life, and your soul! You wouldn’t still be alive if it weren’t for me! You ought to show me the respect I deserve!” He turned back to me. “And you, you unfaithful Satan-spawn… I will keep you hear until your mother rises from that bed and proclaims the name of Jesus Christ, you hear? You are not going anywhere.”*

 *In an act of desperation, I saw the door directly behind us, jumped to my feet, and began to run. My feet felt like they were shackled to balls of heavy stones, and the more I moved with child-like fever, I felt my consciousness slipping. The old man, screaming my name as he could not physically stand in his condition, ordered me to return to my kneeler, but I did not obey. I threw the door open and rushed outside into the blizzard with only my coat and moccasins. The wind pounded against my pale skin, and soon, I disappeared into the storm, the old man’s cries echoing in the desolate valley. While I walked, I heard the voices of thousands crying out to me in the blizzard, like a horde of souls drifting around in a whirlwind of snow and ice as sharp as blades that cut my skin and forced me to my knees. The wind was as strong as tidal waves, and I pushed forward until I was on the brink of collapse. At my weakest moment, my heart slowing, my tiny legs folding under the weight of my upper body, I looked through the white vortex and saw someone approaching me. It was a black shadow that stepped through the snow as if there were no blizzard at all. His form was long, narrow, and the closer he stepped the larger he grew until he towered over me, a thin veil of wind and snow still separating us. I looked up through blurry and thick vision and saw him looking down at me, a cloak covering his entire body. I blinked in desperation to identify him, but could not. Seeing my attempt to move closer, he extended his boney hand to help me out of the snow. I grasped it and smiled while feeling its warmth and the perfection of his hygiene. My awe was short-lived, however, as my brief smile of relief was cast away upon looking up in horror at the eyes of the man no longer obscured by the snow.*

*The storm consumed my tears.*

 

\* \* \*

 

I awoke back in my bed at the Huntington Inn, sweat running down my forehead, my long, black hair damp and tangled. I clutched the sheets tightly, feeling my legs and my arms to make sure I was still not stuck in a dream. One of my worst fears was never knowing if I was awake or still dreaming, which was why I hated nightmares. Though, in this instance, it felt like something more than a dream. I could never recall dreams in their entirety—nightmares were the same. But there were always bits and pieces that lingered. This had felt less like a dream and more like a *memory*. Still, I was awake. There was no cabin, no thin old man, no flies, no shadow. It was just a dream.

I stayed in my hotel room for a few hours to prepare my route for the rest of the day. I planned to get food in downtown North Platte, then return to Route 30 and ride west to Laramie. From Laramie, I would take Wyoming 230 south to Willow. Hopefully I would arrive before sunset, as I did not plan on staying on the road at night—I had a hotel reservation at the only hotel in Willow, also, which is why it was of the utmost importance that I arrive in a timely matter. While dressing that morning, I examined myself in the mirror and saw that the skin around my hands and arms were red. As a man who experienced dozens of winters in Chicago, I knew instantly that it was from exposure to extreme cold, which confused me. My windows had been shut all night, and there had been no breeze—in fact, I had woke up sweating from my nightmare. My nightmare… I had been in a blizzard in my mind… could that have affected my reality? I laughed at my idiocy and continued to get dressed, passing it as a result of a draft from somewhere in the room. After I finished hanging my suspenders over my shoulders, I repacked my belongings and went downstairs to leave my key at the front desk with a tip for the cleaning maid.

The diner I found myself in around eight in the morning was Jesse’s Platter, a bustling brick building with a colorful palette of exterior and interior colors. It was an eyesore in the middle of a dull town, but a good one. The waitress who attended to me was named Laura, a chirpy woman with big blue eyes and hair as red as fire. She struck up a conversation with me as the chef behind the tiled wall fried my egg and sausage. She asked where I was going, where I was coming from, the normal sort of questions you’d ask a stranger. Delightfully, she didn’t stop talking to me, even as she served others. Now, I never considered myself good with talking to women nor did I even consider myself remotely attractive by any modern means. The only one I had truly cared for in this ever-changing world is... *was* Eloisa. But she was gone now. Every time I talked to someone new I would be reminded of Eloisa standing there, watching me speak to them, her saddened, tired eyes searching me for a reason why I was doing what I do, why I would try to move on. She had grabbed a hold of my heart before I lost her and forever branded her spirit into me so that I may never forget her, not even if I tried to cut my own heart out. She would forever wander the earth with me, in life and in death.

 Eloisa, beyond her beauty, had also been a woman of God—it may have been the reason I feel in love with her. She did not associate with the Catholic Church or any denomination for that matter; instead, she focused on maintaining a personal connection with the Lord, one not even a priest could try and replicate. When I met her, she had formed such a deep relationship with God that it brought out all of her natural aspects. Every sin seemed to depart from her. She radiated a light that was pure, white, like fresh linen. Her skin was smooth, clean, soft, like her eyes as she would lay with me, as she would hold my hand, as she would bite her lip as I brushed her hair behind her ear. Our love, unbreakable, our bond, chains forged by heat and time.

But fate had the chain breaker.

I remember the words she said to me from behind the glass of the train’s dirty windows. I was there, on the platform, being shoved by people marching left and right past me. It was a Bible verse. And after, the doors closed, and I found myself staring into the apartment, the rags on the floor, the light of the neon billboard flooding in from the outside, illuminating every single—

“Sir?” Laura asked, snapping me out of my trance. I shook my head, and she giggled. “Well you can’t end a story as good as that without sayin’ what happened! Go on then.”

I rubbed my eyes. Why did my head suddenly feel so loose? It was like someone had taken my anxiety and just lifted it from my body. I felt a hundred pounds lighter, too light. I thought I would be sick. “I uh…” I struggled to get my words out. What had I been talking about? Oh, yeah, some random case I used as a conversation starter from the earlier years of my practice. “I just… I can’t seem to remember.”

“Are you feeling alright?” she asked, snapping me out of my trance and bringing me back to the diner. The weight returned, but my tongue was left feeling bitter, like there were traces of minerals or blood sticking to my taste buds. She gave me a sudden look of concern as I looked around blankly. Yep, she thought I was insane. I took another long, hard drink from my cup. The coffee was strangely sweet. I saw the clear packets of sugar she had mixed in and wondered what brand they were. “You look pale as a sheet, Mr. Ibarra. Are you feeling alright?”

I had never told her my name.

I instantly released my coffee cup, my breath leaving my body. “Yes,” I said, rubbing my forehead. It was time to leave. “Thank you for the talk, Ms. Laura, you have been most kind.” I left her a four-dollar tip on top of what I owed and left prematurely. She watched me leave, her lone expression telling it all. When the door shut, she returned to her normal business and stuffed the empty packet into her pocket.

I drove as fast as I could from North Platte in silence, my tears dried by the fresh air pouring through my open windows. There was construction on an overpass blocking traffic on Route 30 that morning, a mile or so from the town. The workers were redirecting cars on a half-paved road to a series of backroads eventually leading back to the highway, but it would add another half an hour onto my drive. I thanked the worker for his direction, grumbled, then pulled off south bound to follow the other trucks being diverted. The backroads of Nebraska were not as pretty as I had previously imagined they would be. They were rough on my Crown, and some of the gravel dug up from the trucks ahead of me was flung straight at my windshield. It was a miracle I made it back without a scratch in the paint or a crack in the glass.

The remainder of my drive on Route 30 was uneventful. I made one more stop in Laramie after crossing the Wyoming boarder to fill my tank, thankfully this time without any incidents. It was about noon when I noticed two men in similarly colored suits walking quickly down a sidewalk in Laramie to the police station, a brief case in both their hands. I didn’t think much of it until I looked down the street at where they had come from and saw a Hudson Hornet. I stood there terrified, glued to the ground, recognizing the car from my encounter at Don’s Gas’n’Go. It sat on the side of the road, idling with its driver still inside. I wanted to drive away, but the scene was playing out right in front of me, and I needed more information on who wanted me dead. So, against my better judgement, I tapped my holster to ensure my Colt was still in it and made my way across the street to the police station.

The two men were waiting by the receptionist’s desk for someone. They were having a conversation with each other, waving their hands around, bored by the blandness of the office and trying to come up with something smart to say to one of the ladies walking by. I took a seat on a bench near the door and watched their failed attempts at flirting. Tired of their comments, the receptionist left her seat and went into the back to find someone. A man in uniform stepped out in her place and greeted them properly.

It was *you*. The first man said as much when you walked out. I told them apart from their heights; the first was shorter and had more hair. “I hope we aren’t intruding on any important business. We’re here for this week’s collection.”

“You’re a day early,” you said, sternly. “I don’t appreciate that. You know we usually do collections on Wednesdays for a specific reason.”

“Boss wants them early this week, Chief” the second, much taller one, said. “If that isn’t a problem.”

“It’s just out of the ordinary, is all.”

“Well, the boss ain’t exactly what you would call *ordinary*, is he?”

You pondered. “I suppose not.” You grumbled something directly to them in a low voice; I couldn’t make it out. When you finished, you sniffled, wiped you nose, and then turned your back to them. “Give me a minute to get in order. I’ll have my assistant bring it out to you.”

Ten minutes passed before a woman in a blue dress came out, handed the two men one black briefcase identical to theirs. The taller man took it and gave her his. As they walked out of the station, I noticed them constantly switching the cases without a word passed between them. It got to the point where I could not remember which contained their “collection” and which was empty. I trailed them as close as I could before the Hornet came into eyeshot. I pretended to be a happy customer at a local convenience mart examining the fruits on display outside the front windows while they continued their conversation with the driver.

“—matter as long as I still get the boss his money,” I heard the driver one say as I became close enough to hear. “I’ve seen the boss mad about a late collection before. Thank God he gave us our firearms, because if I had to go into one of those again unarmed, I think I’d just about jump off the Bend.”

“Oh quit your complaining,” the driver said, his hat still tipped over his eyes. “All that matters right now is getting him that money. He’s got good use for it, you know.”

“Like what, paying you?”

“Good a use as any.”

They drove away shortly after. I returned to my Crown and slowly crept behind them. They just happened to be going in the same direction out of Laramie. Wyoming Highway 230 was very much unlike the other highways I had taken. It was fairly developed, flat, and it had a beautiful contrast of the black concrete and yellow stripes. Each side of the road had only one lane, but the overpasses over other dirt and some paved roads were newer. Cruising through the rolling hills of Wyoming, I smelled the fresh air from my window, smiled, and stuck my hand out to feel the cool summer wind brushing against my fingertips. My Crown pushed onward up and around bends, through areas of forest and others of vast plains, still far behind the Hornet. Eventually, upon making it to the highest point of the road, I saw it: the sign for Willow, Wyoming.

It was an old sign. Stone lined the base in three rows stacked on top of one another, the top a large frame of old logs that contained seven rows of wooden planks, all painted with the cursive words ‘Welcome to Willow, Wyoming,’ and below that, ‘The Town Without Sin.’ My heart skipped a beat after seeing it. My smile turned into a smug grin. My stalkers had not prevented me from reaching Willow, and as my Crown began its descent down into the Land of the Confluence, I finally saw it.

 *Paradise on earth*.

The view from the top of the hill was absolutely stunning. Nestled between the rolling hills of the prairie was the Land of the Confluence. It was a long triangular strip of land that housed the entire town of Willow. The Blood River of the east and the Golden River of the west both conjoined at the confluence to form the Willow River, a large and beautiful stream of water that flowed south. With only two hours from sundown, the western waters glittered, illuminating the town and revealing its full-blossomed beauty. I was shaking with anxious uncertainty as I continued down the highway. My fate lay before me, disguised as a pretty little prairie town. The perfect place to live. The Town Without Sin.

As I held the wheel of my Crown with one hand amid my arrival, I felt a chill go down my spine. The Hornet had disappeared. I searched left and right, even behind me for it, but it was gone. And the road, the black and yellow road, seemed to continue to stretch on and on, never reaching the town or finishing its curve over the hill. The trees I thought I had passed a few miles back repeated in a loop that made the road feel endless. Twice I thought I passed the Remington Factory—a factory seated atop Elder’s Bend, the tallest elevated landmass in the east valleys of the Rockies—or had it been four? I kept nervously glancing at it as it seemed to reappear behind the same red barn every single time. I managed to keep my composure long enough to realize that something was wrong, and it wasn’t until I looked beside me that I saw the source of my panic. It was an awful angel of death that sat beside me. Around its neck was a golden crucifix, and on its head a flat-brimmed hat. Its face was mangled and twisted into a horrifying expression of pain and joy—I could not tell which because it was constantly twitching and morphing. Its blue lips were parted into a disgusting smile, its rotted teeth shaking as the car bumped down the highway. And then, its boney hand reached up and tilted its hat back so that I may finally see his eyes. They were dark, hollow pits of fire, and somewhere buried deep inside were the irises that once made this thing human. With a croaked laugh, the corpse met my gaze and spoke to me.

“***Welcome to Willow, Mr. Ibarra***.”

The blaring horn of an oncoming truck snapped me back to reality. Seeing those round, yellow headlights barreling towards me, I yanked my wheel back into the other lane just as it shot past. I slammed on the breaks, jerking my Crown off to the side of the road. Breathing unsteadily, my heart still pounding in my chest, I threw my door open and fell out onto my back, the hot pavement stinging my back. I looked back inside my car for the abomination, but it had vanished, leaving me alone and panicking on the side of the road like a madman.

Another series of friendly honks nearly scared the life out of me. A rusted red Ford was rolling down the road behind me. It stopped just behind my Crown. From the driver’s seat outstepped a man in a dirtied mechanic’s uniform, his uniform stained with oil and grease. Scratching his beard and moving his long, wavy brown hair out of his face, he approached me and offered a hand to help me up. “You alright, stranger?” he asked as I steadied myself on my feet. “You look like you might pass out. Can I get you some water or something cold?”

I rubbed my forehead and nodded. “If you don’t mind, and if you have one, then please.”

He went and came back with a cold bottle of water. I cracked it open and drank profusely, trying to regain my grip on reality. “You are real, aren’t you?”

He laughed. “About as real as I can be,” he said, smiling. “I suppose the heat is damn strong today. Causing all sorts of hallucinations and such. My father called them ‘sun strokes.’”

“That explains it,” I laughed, unsure of what to think. “Thank you again Mr.…”

“Mr. Michael Houston, sir, but most people call me Texaco Mike.”

“Marcus Ibarra, private investigator. It's a pleasure to meet you.”

“Anytime, friend,” he said, noticing my car half-off the road. “I saw your little save back there. It would have been a damn shame to see a piece of machinery as fine as this to just go to waste.” I gave him a look. He put his hands up defensively. “But I’m glad you’re all right, too. You can replace a car, but not a life.”

I changed the subject. “Are you a mechanic?”

He looked down at his uniform, then grinned. “Oh, this? It was just my father’s uniform. Worked as a vehicle repairman during the War. Passed it down to me when he couldn’t walk any more. Now I’m just an attendant at the Texaco Gas Station, six miles or so down Old Sunrise Lane. It’s a nice little place, used to be an auto shop and fill station before Texaco bought it out. Said they wanted to ‘Expand themselves to smaller places’ to ‘promote a travel-friendly brand.’ It’s bullshit if I’ve ever heard it. They just saw how well my uncle and father were doing and came in to take it all over. I’ll say, Texaco is *not* a company you wanna mess with. Damn near took most of my uncle’s money in the court case. But yet, here I am, working for them all the same.”

 “Court case?”

“Yep. *Thomas Houston Family v. Texaco Incorporated*. It was a huge battle in the state court that lasted about a month. Of course, Texaco won in the end, but not fairly. Probably paid off those damn jury people. Sick sons a bitches.” Mike shook his head then sighed. “It is awful hot outside today. It gets worse just before golden hour. I suggest we get out of the middle of the road, maybe go to the gas station. We could finish our conversation there. Gas is only twenty-eight cents here if you’d like a fill-up. It’ll be on the house.”

“I appreciate the offer, but I just filled up in Laramie.” I checked my watch. “I really ought to get to my hotel. Again, thank you for your help, Mr. Houston.”

“Alright, stranger. You have yourself a nice night now.”

 “You as well, sir. You as well.”

I made it to my hotel just after sunset. Contrary to the kindness Michael Houston showed me in my moment of panic, my arrival at the Clarington Hotel filled me with nothing but unease. If irritation could have been manifested as a person, it would be the woman standing behind the front desk. The soft lull of the lobby’s music directly collided with the harsh and brutal attitude she gave me as I tried to explain that I did, in fact, have a reservation. I even pulled out the paperwork proving it, but she just would not accept it because my name was “not on my list of arrivals.” With a low sigh, she asked me once again to step aside so that she could help the next guest. I took my paper away and moved to the benches just outside the front door.

The nighttime sky was painted purple and black. The Clarington Hotel stood at the base of Elder’s Bend. It was just a walk away from the banks of the Blood River and the road that provided a route to the scenic view of Willow from an overlook. The hotel itself was massive. It had five floors and, from what I could tell, held about thirty rooms per floor. The main entrance was shaded by a large terrace, one I sat under to consider what I would do when, down the road, speeding towards the entrance road to the Clarington, was the Hudson Hornet I had lost in my pursuit earlier. It roared as it made its way to the terrace. Once he arrived at the terrace over the front doors, he honked his horn several times to alert the man who came out to greet him of his arrival. I put my head down and pretended to be reading my reservation papers while they briefly conversed with one another.

“Hello, sir,” I heard the man say to the driver. “Everything is in order.”

“Well, Damien, if it’s not set up, that wouldn’t exactly be my fault, would it? I put your boss in charge for a reason, and if he’s just gonna throw that away... you know what happens.”

“Of course, sir. He appreciates the responsibility in which you entrusted him. He promises to ensure everything goes smoothly.”

“The dog can’t promise a goddamn thing he can’t give,” the driver said with annoyance in his voice. “Anything he has was given to him. What comes next will happen because it is *allowed* to happen. Am I clear?”

“Yes, sir, you are.”

Revving the engine as a signal that the conversation ended, the man in the suit back off. The driver quickly shifted his Hornet into drive and raced out of the parking lot and back onto the road leading to downtown Willow.

“You heard that, right?” the man named Damien asked, the dust clearing around his pale face.

I looked up from my paper, shocked and suddenly terrified. “What?” I stammered.

He was staring at me now, his eyes wide and bloodshot, his face scarred from little talons that had hooked his skin and left scratches all up and down his cheeks and neck. There were small piercings underneath his eyelids and burn marks on the nape of his neck. He smiled widely and chuckled. “Just remember that you chose this, you good-for-nothing loner,” he said, waving me away with his hand and moving back inside. He kept muttering “*No going back*” over and over until he was out of earshot, somewhere inside of the hotel.

“Wait...” I whimpered, still glued to my seat, watching as the front doors shut behind him. My hands let go of the paper and instead gripped the metal armrest of the bench. I heaved deeply and tried to maintain my composure, but I failed miserably. I could feel my heart beating in my throat, and my stomach churned sickly. What did he mean by that? Was something bad about to happen to me? To someone else? Had I done something? I held my chest and began to race through the possibilities of my mind, of my entire day, of every single conversation I had had from the waitress in North Platte to Michael Houston on the side of the road. Nothing, no comment I had made or interaction I engaged in could have resulted in something as severe as this. Had someone already recognized me? Was I being watched? Was I even safe?

With lowered confidence and an unsteady walk, I gulped and went inside.

The receptionist at once saw me and flagged me down, explaining that she had made a mistake. Nervously glancing around the room, she apologized multiple times and slide my key across the counter. I thanked her, suspicious of what she was looking for, but not wanting to meet anyone else who might want to do me harm. So, my heart still racing from the interaction, I went up to my room. Most think that the best views come from the rooms facing the same direction as the front of the hotel, but in the case of the Clarington, the best view was from the back, where I could see for miles in all directions. Though, the one thing I did not appreciate seeing were the flashes of lightning far off on the horizon. I could feel the wind changing as I stood on the balcony. An intense storm was coming. I figured I had better get inside before it started to downpour.

Just as I shut the balcony door, the phone rang. I was quick to answer. “Hello?” I asked.

“Is this the famed Mr. Ibarra I’ve heard so much about?” a deep male voice asked with enthusiasm in his tone.

“Who is this?” I questioned.

“Not one for pleasantries, I see,” the man continued. “Nonetheless, I must welcome you to Willow, Mr. Ibarra. So how do you like the town so far? Have you been able to get around, see some of the sights, or take in the beauty of this perfect town?”

“I’m afraid I haven’t, no. I just arrived this morning.”

“Well that is a damn shame,” he said, almost shocked. “I must say I am rather shocked. A man like yourself should see everything Willow has to offer.” He paused. “You know, I think it would be best if we met in person. How about you come to downtown Willow, come to my office at the Riverside Club, and we can talk some more.”

“I’d prefer to—”

“Great! Then I’ll see you soon! *Welcome to Willow, Wyoming*, Mr. Ibarra. Welcome!”

The man hung up. I stood in my room, the phone next to my ear, the endless hum of a dead line ringing in my ears.

“The Riverside Club,” I said, checking my gun and grabbing my keys. “Fine. I’ll play along with your games.”

to illustrate my current hurdles, I describe two examples from the last two days:

day before yesterday: i woke up in the morning, felt quit good, no bad cravings, meditated a bit, got some good progress in meditation and suddenly the thought ""great, you make progress, you can get a coffee"" came into my mind, no way to get rid of this idea and so I ended up buying my morning coffee 

today: at the moment I have no car, as I had an accident (no people unvolved) but car is crashed, so I ride bicycle, today in the morning I woke up at 5 a.m. and really bad cravings, I searched for a bakery or a gas station that is open already and ended up riding my bike on a sunday morning at 5 am to a gas station to buy a coffee, this is so ridiculous, but it is a real addiction

I have no idea how I should come out of this cycle, sometimes I think maybe I should just let it go and drink coffee and not worry about it but I know that I am lying to myself

just wanted to share this with you, maybe you have some tips or even similar experiences 

thank you all for being here and helping each other in this sub

1pm6ziu,https://www.reddit.com/r/HallmarkMovies/comments/1pm6ziu/holiday_touchdown_a_bills_love_story/,Holiday Touchdown: A Bills Love Story,"The Positives:

1. Cute enough love story and I liked how the main Love Story was connected in its way to the revealed 

2, I find Holland Roden ridiculously appealing. Love her voice. I liked how they had Five Gold Rings on the marquee at the movie theater. Twice too in case you missed it the first time.

3. It was quite the good supporting casts too. However, I was a little confused as to who was who and their various relationships. A whole bunch of familiar faces among the cast. However, I didn't recognize Santa though. I see that he was in the Chiefs film which I avoided last year although I suppose after February 9th I could have watched with quiet satisfaction. At first I thought the guy who played Santa was the one Gabe called ""Coach"" but I guess I won't be a member of the Bills Mafia anytime soon. Hmm. ""Bills Mafia."" I wonder if any of them know coffee importer Sonny Cortnthos. I liked how they mentioned Beef on Weck. I saw a movie that took place in Rochester and they had this too. 

4. Love the cameos. I recognized some of the Bills but others I didn't. It would have been great if they had Marv Levy but at least his quotes are in there. He recently turned 100. Bravo. Anyway, I recognized that bartender. Two scenes with him. Tyler and Hunter showing up so soon after the first scene threw me for a loop. Then I realized the connection.

5. Yeah, love that date at the beginning. That guy was totally wrong for her. He was little too much. His reminded me of Paul Lynde and that's not good for any lady especially a passionate one like Morgan. 

The Negatives:

1. White I appreciate the the Bills connections for the film, after awhile it did seem like they had very else to talk about except for the Bills. Also it was like product placement on steroids. This probably annoyed me more than most since I don't normally catch the product placements in these films. 

2. The overall story was relatively thin. Also they were extremely lucky to find that receipt. I guess that was a little bit of the Christmas magic that Santa and Mr.s Claus were talking about. Also I was going to say ""Ford? Really? That is probably a very popular name in any big city in the Northeast."" Also I think of BC when someone says Abbotsford which I feel was a nice touch by the Canadians. 

3. Okay. I know they were are tough people in Buffalo but I've seen this in way too many Hallmark movies; the lack of gloves in December. Well, here in the northern part of the Western hemisphere. I guess if they in Australia in December it would have been good. But nope, we have to keep it real, people. You are not filming in December but you still need the gloves on. Okay. Got that out of my system. 

4. I thought when they threw the tailgate at the party at the end they were already in the stadium? So Morgan and her mom? went back to the house to get more food. They were allowed to come back? I guess you are since they are not in the stadium itself. 

5. Why didn't Cathy didn't just get a Cesarean? I know there are risks but surely eating a ton of very hot foods is no way to go either. In the words of Prissy, ""I don't know nothing about birthin babies."" So to me it seemed like a whole lot of extra stress involved.  Gosh, I can't believe I wrote to much This was supposed to be not so long. I have a problem. I need help. Ha ha ha. ",2,1765692557.0,HallmarkMovies,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1pm6wd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1pm6wd2/credit_card_experience_in_vietnam/,Credit Card Experience in Vietnam,"I went to Phu Quoc, then Ho Ahn, and finally Hanoi. I had a similar card experience in all three cities.

\- Most local vendors and street shops wouldn’t accept credit cards.

\- The few that did, including restaurants, coffee shops, and other small stores, added a 3% fee on top of the bill to avoid paying any charges.

\- Shops in malls and big department stores like King Kong Mart didn’t impose any extra charges.

\- You can make large purchases like iPhones at electronic stores, and they accept cards without any additional fees. However, I’ve recently heard from family and during my own visit that they’re no longer providing VAT refundable bills, which makes buying in Vietnam less appealing.

\- At Hanoi airport, all prices are displayed in dollars, and it’s ridiculously expensive. The food isn’t great either.

Using cards with forex markup can really be expensive. You might end up paying 3% extra on your coffee shop bills, plus another 3.5% fee from your bank.

I used the AU Ixigo card for my travels. Getting Vietnamese currency in India was pretty pricey, so I figured it was better to use my credit card most of the time, even with the extra 3% fee the shops charged.

A small group of us met through the GR subreddit earlier this year and have turned into a pretty solid friend group. We’re women ages 25–35 in different areas in West Michigan (areas around the Lakeshore, GR, Ionia, and Hastings) and get together about 3 times a month for things like crafts & coffee, trivia nights, markets, thrifting, exploring parts of Michigan, and outdoor activities.

We use Discord as the platform to plan meet ups and keep in touch. We also use it to play video games or watch movies during busy weeks or when the weather is too bad to see each other in person.

This isn’t a big meetup group or event page; it’s more about forming real friendships. We’re all busy, but we make time for each other intentionally. We want to welcome more people who are in search of the same thing in Kzoo!

1pm6vkl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pm6vkl,Starter cases: how “cheap” actually works,"
If you’re new here, start with cases. Patterns matter more than brands.

Some examples we’ll discuss often:

BYD / EV manufacturing
Low prices don’t just come from batteries.
They come from labor intensity, supply-chain pressure, state-backed risk buffering, and long-term costs pushed outward.

Shein / fast fashion
Speed + volume + opacity.
Workers burn out, waste explodes, prices stay fake.

Luckin Coffee/fastfood
Subsidized pricing, aggressive expansion, losses absorbed, habits reshaped.
“Affordable” built on financial and labor pressure.

DeepSeek & AI companies
Engineering efficiency is real.
So is cost externalization — to workers, data privacy, and future regulation.

These aren’t isolated scandals.
They’re the same model repeating.
If you want to understand cheap, stop asking “is this product bad”
and start asking:
What costs are missing from the price tag?
That’s what this subreddit is for.

I’ve watched videos and read a lot (but obviously not enough hence asking questions here).I use a plastic Hario V60 size 02 with cafec abaca filters. I’m only following the Hoffman’s recipe from the Timer.Coffee app and I have a regular water boiler, but I make sure to pour closer and following the instructions, and Wilfa Aroma grider that I usually set to the last S of «aeropress» for a fine-medium grind, sometimes I’ll go toward the last e of the word. Oh and a normal kitchen weight for grams and lm (not a a coffee one)

I make coffee for 2. I’m really looking forward to improving and learning more before I buy/replace equipment as I have the tendency to go all in on hobbies. 

The thing is… I received a very nice advent calendar in the form of coffee beans each day. There’s no info on the roast, so I asked but the coffee company hasn’t provided info. I thought knowing that would help me see if I needed to go coarser or finer. The thing is I only get 45 gr each day of each type and I can’t really test different grind sizes to find the best method for the beans. I thought if I went with a v60 size 1 and try that for the rest of the days? I’ve tried one cup on the 02, but not sure if it was the right process and method that day or if I make one better cup using the size 02… or it the one original left hario paper was the reason. That coffee was good! Can’t reproduce it since I don’t have those beans anymore! 

PS: sometimes I feel dumb because everything kinda feels «salt» like, so that’s where I am.

I tried the mushroom croquettes and mushroom sauce pizza! ❤️They even have mushroom growing rooms that you can see, which is honestly pretty cool and not something you see in cafés often.

Cocktails were another highlight. The menu is inspired by farming processes (soil, seed, sprout, bloom, etc.). Tried a coffee/dessert-style cocktail -amazing! 

The vibe is calm and cozy, good for conversations and slow evenings. Also, there’s a very sweet dog named Bella who just quietly hangs around and completely adds to the charm.

Overall, feels like a place where a lot of thought has gone into what they’re doing. Would definitely recommend and go back.

1pm6s13,https://www.reddit.com/r/HpyloriNaturally/comments/1pm6s13/positive_story/,Positive story,"Hello everyone 
                              If you are feeling hopless from this bad bug. I am here to give some hope. My hpylori story started in july of this year. I used to get acedity when i drank coffee or tea. My doctor teasted me for hpylori and it came back positive. He prescribed me 3 antibiotics and 1 ppi. It made my position worst. I did not have any problem with digestion before treatment but after those antibiotics i was not able to digest anything. I finished that 14days somehow and went to emergency department 2 times in those 14 days maybe those antibiotics were not reacting well in my body but my doctor pushed me to take 14 days. After 4 weeks of treatment i tested again and it came back as nit determined. I tested again after 1 week[5 week] it came back positive. I was almost crying because all those good bacteria were dead which were digesting my food but that hpylori was still there. I was not in position where i can start another treatment because whatever i was eating coming out of my body after few hours. I was soo stressed and i was soo negative because i was searching soo much on reddit where people were saying you can never cure this with natural protocol. Then i came in this group and searched every single post and sent them dm how they treated it and i did few treatments one after one.

First one -  1000mg mastic gum first thing in morning
Craneberry juice
Took breakfast[boiled vegetables and rice or boiled quail eggs, olive oil] 1 capsule of organo oil
After 3 hour 2 or 3 tablets of pepto bismol 
After 2 hours fruits/ probiotic 1 tablet
After 1 hour 1000mg mastic gum
After 1 hour lunch with 1 tbsp of coconut oil and organo oil capsule
After 3 hours 2-3 tablets pepto bismol 
After 2 hours Craneberry juice/ celery juice/ sometimes cabbage juice.
Then after half an hour lunch usually bone broth mixed with boiled vegetables and olive oil 1 tablet of organo oil
Then after two hours 1 tablet of probiotic 
And then after half an hour mastic gum before bed 1000mg

My stools were very black during this treatment my loose motions were on and off. My enery level was little up.

After two weeks i took off pepto and organo and added 1 tbsp of manuka honey every morning and then started taking garlic with honey three times a day i think it made my situation worst i started having diarea. I was soo broken at this moment i was thinking it is not working. I stopped garlic. Continued with mastic gum, Craneberry juice , manuka honey for another week and gave my digestion some rest from supplements.

Here is when things started gets changing. I started doing yoga 40 min every morning and 20-30 min evening. 10 min qigong before bed.This was game changer. I will make detailed video which yoga i started doing one yoga is send air in our body which cleans body. 
And then after a week i added 1/4 tbsp of black seeds 2 time after breakfast and dinner. In 14 days i was 90% cured. Then i stopped taking all of those and rechecked with UBT test after two weeks and it was negative. Then i waited few more weeks and tested for stool test and it was negative. 

The main thing that helped was yoga, qigong , my mind which trusted the process. I would say if you are going through same phase don't be scared trust god and process whatever you are doing. God will heal you. Pray every day. Whatever you are taking tell yourself it will kill hpylori in your mind. Read power of subconsious mind book. People healed from very big diseases with this power. I hope everyone heal from this. I thank god for this healing.

This is an unpopular opinion and not doctrine, just my own opinion, but I feel that we consume too much soda. 

Seriously, I don't think soda is much healthier than coffee. Sure, we follow the Word of Wisdom because it's a commandment. But after taking a health and nutrition class at Ensign College, I just feel bad for those who can't live without it. My grandmother had really bad diabetes toward the end of her life and consumed Coca-Cola like no other. It broke my heart to see her suffer like she did. 

I remember President Nelson's warning to us during his October 2023 General Conference talks entitled ""Think Celestial."" He said, ""Any addiction﻿—be it gaming, gambling, debt, drugs, alcohol, anger, pornography, sex, or even food﻿—offends God. Why? Because your obsession becomes your god."" Now, I don't think the majority of us are obsessed or addicted to soda. But at least being in Utah, I have seen some concerning levels of soda consumption. 

President Holland said, ""We should all be as fit as we can be—that’s good Word of Wisdom doctrine. That means eating right and exercising and helping our bodies function at their optimum strength. We could probably all do better in that regard."" Are we expected to have the perfect body and become athletes? No. But God gave us a body as a gift and to be good stewards of them.

I've been in Bangalore for the better part of a decade now and life has been pretty interesting. I've met a lot of fascinating people, both online and offline. My work is pretty interesting, so thats something I'm grateful for.  I was in a pretty great relationship that lasted quite a bit.  All in all, life has been pretty great.

A few years ago, I was someone who's daily routine was just my work and my apartment where I'd just sit on computer/whatever gaming console I had at the time, watch a whole lot of content,  a few phonecalls to my school buddies once in a while, and a series of very dumb and sometimes serious conversations with myself.  I was someone who decided to just remain single for the rest of my life.  I had become so used to it, and I used to really like spending time with myself.

But life had other plans, and I met someone and things just happend, and we broke up. I was prepared to go back to being single and I assumed it would be just like riding a cycle, and I could  go back to my old ways. But over the last four years, a lot has changed, as it inevitably would.  People would move on with their lives, and phonecalls and meetups with friends are few and far inbetween.  I mean, I don't know why I'm surprised, its only natural. So life is lonliner than it used to be. But it is what it is.

But besides the loneliness, I realized how much I actually missed that connection  I had in the realtionship.  I know it's obvious to most people, but I guess I was dumb for thinking I could get over it.

So, I'm looking for someone to chat with throughout the day. We can talk about anything from the existential dread of a Monday morning to the best places to find good biryani in this city. To  talk about mindless scrolling, a sounding board for bad jokes, and maybe, just maybe, someone to meet up with for a coffee or a beer.  
If it grows into something meaningful and long term, that would be amazing.

A little about me: I'm 33, work in research and also on a startup (I know, shocking), and have a slightly unhealthy obsession with sci-fi movies and shows. I'm also a pretty decent cook and can whip up a mean biriyani/pasta.

# If you're also looking for someone to just chat with, or if you're just looking for someone to break the monotony of your day, send me a message.

Anyway, I started doing the usual  Skyscanner, Google Flights, Hopper. Prices were brutal. Like, “did I accidentally try to book a private jet?” brutal.
Out of desperation, I ended up on a site I’d never used before Travolic. It felt almost… too simple? Like I’d stepped into an alternate internet from 2013 when websites didn’t try to sell you 14 pop-ups and “travel insurance for 19.99.”
Weird thing is... I actually found a cheaper flight there. Same airline. Same route. Legit68 cheaper than what I saw on Google Flights. I thought it was a trap. I double-checked on the airline’s own site and it all matched up. I still don’t get how, but it worked.
Don’t just trust the big names, sometimes these smaller sites like Travolic pull better results. also I  double-check baggage rules. Some aggregators don’t show carry-on limits.
If anyone knows whether pricing algorithms differ by region or time of day… I’m starting to think there’s a time window between 2:00–3:00 AM where flights are magically cheaper in the multiverse.

It looks like Europe and China are similar for standard household voltages, so it might not be as much of an issue, but what about the US?  IE for a common roaster like the Kaleido M6s, would it be limited to the US standard 1500 watts?  In the Chinese specs the M6s runs at 2250W, which would be substantially quicker getting up to temps than 1500W.  

Am I missing something or are the adapted machines a weaker version of the roasters?

Just feeling alone with all these thoughts right now.

Girlfriend (F24) and I (F24) met on a dating app but we new each other through mutual friends as well. We talked/flirted/texted for a few months almost daily but both had really busy lives, until we finally went on a first date. It was over for us both from there. I felt something for her that first day we met in person that I had never felt for people I dated for years. We got to know each other for another month or so before making it official, and dated for three months. 

I know this sounds like a sappy ex, but truthfully we were made for each other. All of our friends saw how happy we were, how safe and healthy our relationship was, and loved us together. We talked frequently about communication, how we wanted to keep the relationship going, talking about our future in a way neither of us ever had before. 100% the most confident, safe, comfortable, enjoyable relationship either of us had every been through. But alas,

She has struggled with depression her entire life and is very resistant to treatment, trying many medications and therapy in her time. When we met she also had just upheaved her life across the country back to her hometown and to live with her parents because her living situation fell apart. She explained to me how this+her diagnosed autism that she's never thought affected her that much has made her realize how poorly she was taking care of herself and putting everything aside for our relationship. She was VERY attentive, caring, and invested in my emotions and how I was doing and making me happy, but was hesitant to let me do the same. She said she's realized how she doesn't know how to separate her love and focus on me from other things she needs to focus on like therapy, finding a career, bettering herself, etc., and was putting all her happiness into the relationship. 

Our breakup was four hours long, very tearful, loving, kissing, etc., where she kept saying how much she loved me and it wasn't my fault and she tried so hard to figure out a way to get better while staying with me, but she knows she couldn't. We talked about going no contact, but both knew we couldn't have each other out of our lives, and she said she has no idea how long she'll need to be alone for and doesn't want me to change anything about my life for her or wait for her in a way that hurts me because she has no idea of a timeline, but also said over and over that I am the only one she would ever want to marry, I'm the only person she's ever wanted kids with, planned a future with, met her family., etc. We made a lot of jokes about ""If you date someone else I'll be really mad and not happy for you,"" and she assured she wasn't going to. We also ended the night by agreeing to meet up for coffee to check in with each other, upon her request and we picked a date for five weeks from now. 

I am just so lost. I don't want to be waiting around for her, but she was my dream, you know? Having a life with her was more important to me than anything else I really had in mind, and that was mutual. How do I do what I need to do for myself without closing the door on us completely? It's been two weeks, but it still doesn't feel real. Do you think there's any chance we could be together again?

I’m a college kid (19F) and I’ve been outgoing my whole life. I love parties, getting to know new people, and have been described by others as extroverted, but I hang out around a lot of introverts and like all kinds of people/don’t care if interactions are awkward sometimes

Now for context: Recently I’ve been getting about 4 hours (or less) of sleep a night because I’m an art student and it’s finals week. During this time I’ve been away from my apartment so I keep forgetting to take my (albeit low dose of) Lexapro. Up until yesterday it had been about six days.

Anyway let’s get to the meat now. I went to a party last night with a few people I know somewhat well from class and had a great time, no social anxiety issues, but this morning when I was invited to my best friend’s apartment for pancakes and pulp fiction I felt like I was being annoying the whole time. Every word that came out of my mouth felt stupid and like I didn’t want to say it. I was apologizing a shit ton and was constantly checking my friend’s facial expressions for a sign that they wanted me to leave, but they never told me to go and actually made me coffee. I felt so weird.

I’ve noticed that this has happened to me before, where I’ll get these random bouts of social anxiety like once every couple of months around people I know very well and have been comfortable around for years. Also the people I associate myself with aren’t even judgy— they’re wholesome nerdy art kids that are all very smart and sweet and exactly who I want to be around.

Anyways, I’m just wondering if anybody else has this same issue or if it’s just me.

Here’s what I’m thinking the potential reasons are:

Med withdrawal, anxiety might be higher (but I’ve felt this even without med withdrawal)

Fear of rejection with people that are close to me—I care about them so I’m more worried about irritating them because I don’t want to lose the people I love

Hangover-I’ve heard if you’re on Lexapro alcohol worsens depression so probably worsens anxiety too

ADHD: I don’t know if my adhd affects social interaction even in sporadic bits but I feel like a lot of weird shit is explained by my adhd so maybe that’s why

The End

1pm6giv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pm6giv,"Updated custom home floor plan (Sacramento, CA) – incorporated your feedback. Round 2 critique welcome!","Hi r/floorplan,

A few weeks ago I posted our early draft and asked for feedback. My wife and I are designing the home we hope to raise our kids in (Sacramento, CA) and eventually age in place.

Original feedback thread:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/floorplan/comments/1ow77w3/early\_custom\_home\_floorplan\_feedback\_5br/](https://www.reddit.com/r/floorplan/comments/1ow77w3/early_custom_home_floorplan_feedback_5br/)

Family / timeline context:  
We have a 2-year-old daughter and twin boys who are 3 months old. By the time we get through design, permitting, build, and move-in, we’re guessing the kids will be roughly 4 and 2.

First off: **thank you**. The feedback on the first post was insanely helpful (and very candid 😅). We went through the comments with our architect in detail, and we made a bunch of changes based directly on what you all called out. Especially around long walking paths / “sprawling linear plan” distance issues, the primary suite circulation (walking through mudroom/butler pantry), and the kids wing being far from the primary.

**Changes we made based on your feedback**

We incorporated a lot, including:

* Primary bath / WIC / primary laundry reshuffle
* Better flow and access from the primary area (no more “why am I walking through the mudroom/butler pantry to get to my bedroom?” energy)
* Removed pool access from Bath 4
* Closed off the kids’ rec area so it’s not a messy pass-through hallway zone
* Revised Laundry 2 access (closer/more logical to the kids bedrooms)
* Added a coat closet off the entry (several of you were absolutely right)
* Moved the sauna and cold plunge into a new workout / wellness area that better integrates with the pool and spa
* Added an open terrace off the primary bedroom (love this idea for morning coffee / sanity breaks)

**The big issue you all hammered: primary vs kids distance**

A lot of the strongest feedback revolved around the distance between the primary suite and the kids’ bedrooms, especially with little kids + safety/emergencies + pool concerns.

We agree. Our current assumption is that while the kids are young, we’ll use one of the bedrooms closer to the kids’ wing (or build in flexibility for that), and eventually transition into the primary suite as they get older.

**What we’d love help on in Round 2**

I’m attaching the latest plans in this post. Would love any feedback, big or small, on:

1. Any remaining friction points in circulation / daily flow
2. Whether the current solution to “parents near kids when young” feels workable
3. Kitchen / island / pantry/back-kitchen functionality (we heard loud and clear that weird/deep islands can become a maintenance nightmare)
4. Any “you’ll regret this later” items you still see (roof complexity, driveway/site circulation, ADU access/feel, etc.)

Again, thank you. The first round was fantastic and genuinely improved the design!

PS – A few clarifying design notes based on questions from the last round:

* On the site plan, we’re constrained to build within the base flood elevation line (not “floor” - typo on the drawing). The lot’s topography creates some non-obvious constraints that drive the footprint and orientation.
* Garage 2 isn’t actually a garage in practice - it will function as my home office / workshop space. No vehicles planned there.
* The driveway wrapping behind the house is a remnant of the prior structure and must remain in place due to permitting requirements, even though it looks odd at first glance.
* Pool safety is the #1 priority.

1pm6e0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerickcity/comments/1pm6e0e/new_to_limerick/,New to Limerick,"I (34F)recently moved to Limerick for my dream job (kind of) as mid-career professional back in September. I'm not Irish and I dont belong to any major ethnic or racial groups residing here. I was living in Athlone (Co. Westmeath) for the past three years. I studied a level 9 course at TUS Athlone Campus and was starting to develop some friendships and a social circle. I worked in Dublin for 1.5 year while still living in Athlone and eventually started working in Athlone. This is just a rant/observations about my move to Limerick and the 304.

I moved to Ireland mostly for my career (and my love for gingers jk) so I thought I can make friends and develop a social circle in Limerick too. My initial thoughts were that Limerick was just a much bigger Athlone. I lived in a very small country that was also an island growing up so everything is bigger for me in comparison.

For those who dont know, Athlone is smack in the middle of Ireland, and has the river Shannon flowing through it too. I lived in the city center and loved it so so much. I enjoyed the cafés, the river, shopping centers, Athlone Little Theater, Luan Art Gallery, the arcade, all sorts of café's, speciality coffee shops (with the best matcha ever), boba tea, good takeaways and restaurants near me, Sean's Bar (Ireland's oldest bar/pub), some questionable night clubs but it was good craic. Point to note is that all of these things were at a walkable distance. Lets say within a 3km radius and that included where I worked, which was a 20 to 30 minute bus ride away and WFH twice a week. I don't own a car due to personal reasons and I didnt need to before I moved to Limerick.

I moved to a suburb somewhere between Dooradoyle and Raheen. Ever since I've been here it's been very isolating since I don't own a car (everything fun is in the city) and I'm new here. Im mostly an introvert but I like having a social life, not the biggest fan of drinking but I do on occasion (cause its Ireland lol). I dont even have issues making friends, I'm actually quite good at it. I've made some friends at my new workplace too (initial stages). I usually take the 304 bus to go to work or city to do my weekly shop. It's so unpredictable and has the most annoying route. I try and keep in touch with my friends from Athlone but its tough. The commute using public transport is so tiresome. There's just one bus that takes 2 hours each way. The train takes more than 3 hours each way, so that's not an option.

Limerick is great as well, I've explored the city center since I work in town. Love that charity shop with the piano, all the shops are great, the quays are alright. I really liked the Milk Market and the Crescent Shopping Center. Explored a few pubs in the city too, Rashers was nice. I even visited Stonehall Farm which is outside the city and saw an ostrich (upclose) for the first time in my life, it was great! I like the newly renovated train station too, havent seen how it looked before but it's cute regardless. I've still got lots of places to explore like the Hunt Museum, King John's Castle and some social scenes I came across online. Food is okayish and a bit expensive compared to Athlone (on par with Dublin tho). Viko Viko is my fav so far. Sunflower Bakery is AMAZING. Haven't found a decent matcha so far tho. Taxi's cost so much here for some reason, I might be wrong. It's definitely the inflation. Dont get me started on the rent (I know, I know). 

I know getting a car would solve a lot of my problems but I have a personal loan that I want to pay off first. I relied a lot on on my BF's car, who I only see on weekends as he lives in Galway. But the cars engine died recently and he will be waiting a while before buying a new one. That has affected me too as I dont see him as often. And we resort to spending time with each other virtually. I'll be making an effort to have a hobby and hitting the gym more in the new year. Maybe join a social group that requires very minimal commitment as it's so annoying to take the 304. And I feel like I've been spending so much money on Taxis because I feel lazy to take the bus.

Moving to town is also not an option because I refuse to live in a matchbox of a room without a personal bathroom sharing with a gazillion other housemates (on my 1000/month budget). I'm too old for that. I also don't want to live in owner occupied places with a million rules as I have my BF over most weekends. My living arrangement is okay so far, I live with two other professionals (even tho one of them is a gross pig). It's mostly a matter of getting used to the place and expanding my social circle (I hope so lol). And eventually getting a car in the long run. 

Any suggestions/recommendations welcome.

P.s. So excited for Christmas Holidays as I will get a chance to visit Athlone and see my friends for the first time since moved here! Also excited to vist the Christmas Market and do other festive activities in Limerick.",2,1765690487.0,limerickcity,0,1.0,False

problems arise often in my house. even though i’m the primary caregiver, i have no authority. i take care of my siblings, myself, and my parents, but the main authority is still my parents. their decision is final no matter what. it’s unfair and counterproductive. i can’t raise my kids if i can’t discipline them.

anyway, today’s problem was pants. my youngest brother KI (7M) has been wearing nothing but underwear for three days. he has not changed his underwear, cleaned his underwear, or bathed whatsoever. when i first saw him on Wednesday after school, i asked why he was home. “i’m sick, mom said i can stay home” he said. i took his temperature the night before and gave him vitamins just in case. he’s not sick. no fever, no cough, no stomach or digestive problems.

i went upstairs and asked my mom “why is KI home?” “he’s sick” she said. i asked “did you take his temperature this morning?” “no” she said. “i checked last night, he’s not sick” i said.

“then why won’t he put his clothes on? he’s obviously warm” she said. i took his temperature again. 98.5 Fahrenheit. perfect temperature. i told him to go out pants on. he asked why, and i said he may actually get sick if he doesn’t. it’s winter where we live. he said no. i grabbed his hand and started to walk with him up the stairs. i wasn’t dragging him, carrying him, or hitting him. i was literally just holding his hand and walking him up the stairs to be sure he didn’t run away to avoid getting dressed. my mom came out of the room, yelled at me, and KI remained in his underwear.

the same thing went on for the past few days. i try to get him dressed, my mom says no, and i get in trouble. it’s important to note that my mom doesn’t leave her bed unless she’s going to work or yelling at me. i bring her food, drinks, and brush her hair all while she’s in bed. she wakes up, uses the restroom, i bring her coffee and she **never leaves her bed.**

today was truly my breaking point. KI was awake at midnight, watching what i can only describe as brain melting AI slop, in the same pair of underwear he’s had on since Wednesday. today is Saturday. i tell him to turn the TV off. he says no. i do it myself. i tell him to put pants on. he says no. i pick him up and carry him to the stairs. once again, **i am not hitting him or dragging him,** i am literally cradling him like a baby because that’s what he’s acting like. then i hold his hand **NOT FUCKING HARMING HIM IN ANY WAY** and we walk halfway up the stairs. i’m getting a bit loud, saying “i’ve told you not to watch that on the TV. as soon as you get dressed, no more TV, you’re going straight to bed.”

i think that’s perfectly reasonable because KI is in his underwear at midnight, but here comes my mom. “**OMG LET GO OF HIMMMMM HE’S FINEEEE LEAVE HIM ALONEEEE”**

he’s not fine, i’m not fine, she’s not fine. why is it so bad that i tried to get my brother to wear pants? i literally had not seen my mom out of bed all day and i’ve been awake since 8:00 this morning. i give up.",1,1765690405.0,Parents,1,1.0,False

I’ve (26M) been interested in getting to know this girl (26F) for a while now, and so about a month ago I messaged her and asked if she’d be keen to grab a coffee because I’d love to get to know her. She said yes.

We started texting more between that conversation and hanging out which was about a week after, and the hangout went really well. I really enjoyed getting to know her, she’s really cool. When I walked her to her car, I asked her if I could take her out on a date and she said yes, “I’d love to”.

I started getting excited about the fact that this could go somewhere. I’ve only had a girlfriend once before and I reckon I’m ready to look at settling down.

So I planned the date to be about a week and a half after I asked her. We kept texting but I could see myself starting to get consumed by this person, getting nervous about every interaction, overthinking my messages to her, like really becoming consumed to the point I started becoming a bit anxious and not eating normally. Typing this out, I can see how much this whole thing is messing with me. (Can I just add I’m so happy being single, but I think because we get along well and share the same values and faith).

Anyway I was trying to be calm and collected and I wouldn’t over text or text her “yo why aren’t you answering” if she took ages, so I felt like I was doing okay.

So the day came for the date and we went out, had a really good time but here’s where I feel like I jumped the gun. I was driving her home and we were talking about random stuff, relationships, work, life etc. So I thought it was a good time to bring up my intentions and I said “hey I have a crush on you, and I want to get to know you more. I’m just letting you know my intentions, that I would like to pursue you”. She didn’t really say much, but when I dropped her off I asked if I can take her out again and she said “let me think about it and I’ll text you”.

She texted me and said she doesn’t know how she feels and she doesn’t want to play with fire because she can tell I love hard and I’m a lover boy. She said she is down to hangout again but she’s worried about hurting me if nothing ends up happening. I ended up telling her that this is the risk of getting to know someone and that from what I’ve learnt about her, I feel like she’s worth pursuing. I told her I didnt mean to come off too strong or pressure her into anything and that I was just trying to make intentions clear that I’m serious about this.

She ended up replying and said she’s thankful for the message and that she appreciated that I could be open and honest. We’ve been talking a little bit on and off but I feel like I’ve botched it and I’m annoyed with myself for moving with my heart a lot quicker than my head.

I’m going away for 3 weeks to visit family and I don’t know what to do, I feel like I’m forcing conversation to keep flowing but I hate feeling like this.

I was told by friends just hang back but stay consistent in getting to know her, to keep being around without bringing any of this up again for a while.

Any advice? What’s everyone’s experiences with this stuff, is there a “right” way/time to convey intentions?

I love my apartment, and so far all the other students here are nice.

I'm on the 3rd floor and there are 5 apartments on this floor. The apartment to the left of me is open, as the last student moved out after finishing his degree. So yesterday, a new student who started his studies this semester moved here from his old place.

He was here to look at the apartment and pick up the keys. I met him outside on the hallway. As a good neighbour, i wanted to introduce myself. So I did, and even offered him a cup of coffee (I need to fight my antisocial life and make more friends lmao). 

This dude... looks at me... up and down... UP AND DOWN... and scoffs at me, just to say ""Don't talk to me woman. I will talk to you, you don't talk to me. Better go back to your 3rd world country"". This dumbass, SERIOUSLY!

I am the general manager of a corporate coffee shop, similar to Starbucks, and he's a barista. I've always thought of him as attractive but not my type. Also worth noting that we have some mutual friends, so I knew of him before we worked together (I transfered to his store in my promotion) and still occasionally see him at parties, but we havent chatted much, mostly on my part to keep work separate. Anyways, we had our store holiday party last weekend, and I dont often see him without the uniform and the hat (his hair 😍). And we were all playing games and letting loose. No alcohol but it went late into the night, and I got to see a side of him that he doesnt show much at work. And he also got new glasses around the same time that really work for him. And all of a sudden I'm thinking of him in a new way.

I enjoy a mild work crush from time to time, something to look forward to at work, but this is different. We share a lot of hobbies and interests too. And he broke up with his girlfriend a month ago and is weirdly okay with it. I can't act on this, I know. It'd be one thing if I was a supervisor one step above him. I also dont know if its just my skewed perspective but I feel like he's been acting kinda different towards me since the holiday party and part of me wonders if he also likes me. I do think I fall into the same ""type"" as his ex, to a degree. Either way, I have to keep from acting like a stereotypical crushing school girl lately when we work together.

Been living in my Prius for about four months now. Everyone talks about the big stuff:where to park, how to stay safe, where to shower. But maybe the small comforts that make this actually sustainable long-term. share mine here:

My heated blanket. Got a 12v one from Walmart for $30. On cold nights, it uses less power than running the car but keeps me perfectly warm. Total game-changer for staying cozy.
The 12v mini humidifier. Didn't expect to need this, but sleeping in a dry car was killing my sinuses. This little $25 thing makes mornings so much better.

My travel kettle. Being able to make proper tea or instant coffee without needing to stop somewhere has been huge for my mood. I use it with my Anker Solix C2000 Gen2 that sits behind the passenger seat - way better than relying on gas station coffee.

What surprised me most was how these small things added up. The first month was all about survival, but these comforts made it start feeling like an actual lifestyle. The power station handles all my little electronics without me having to hunt for outlets constantly, which honestly reduces my daily stress more than I expected.

a few months ago, my derm told me to simplify. now my daily routine is:

gentle cleanser (AM + PM)

moisturizer (AM + PM)

broad-spectrum sunscreen (AM)

occasional / as needed stuff my derm recommends:

brimonidine (Mirvaso) or oxymetazoline (Rhofade) for intense redness

topical meds like azelaic acid, metronidazole, or ivermectin for bumps

low-dose oral doxycycline if inflammation spikes

laser/IPL treatments for veins or persistent redness

to actually figure out what triggers me, i track everything in a notes app and a simple skincare tracking app, coffee, stress, sun, wine, sleep, just small notes to see patterns instead of guessing. it's shocking how much clarity that gives.

it actually worked. redness isn't gone, bumps aren't perfect, but my flares are shorter, my skin heals faster, and my face feels calmer. small wins, but it feels like progress for the first time in forever.

This has been stuck in my head for a long time and I’m trying to sort out if I’m reading too much into it.

There was a girl I used to see all the time at my gym. We’d talk pretty often—not just surface level stuff. She’d tell me about her life, school, and places she liked. It felt natural, not forced.

Right before the semester ended, I finally asked her out for coffee. She said she was really busy with exams and packing to leave. When I asked, her face turned red and she got visibly flustered. I gave her my number and she said she’d text me later. She never did.

Here’s the part that keeps looping in my head.

A couple weeks later, I was walking down the street and didn’t even notice her walking past me. I was looking down. She and her friend passed me. Then, after we were already well past each other, she turned around.

She didn’t just look back.

She bit her finger and smiled.

Her friend turned around and looked back too.

That one small moment has lived in my head ever since.

Years later, I found out she dated a guy who looks oddly similar to me in some ways—not identical—just enough that it made me stop and think.

And more recently, she popped up under “people you may know” on Snapchat even though I don’t have her contact.

I’m not trying to make this into something it wasn’t. I’m genuinely asking: did I miss something real, or does your brain build meaning out of unresolved moments?

1pm5w9n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pm5w9n,I Just Launched a Lifetime Deal: AI Voice Notes With Real Privacy ($39.99),"Building an app that respects privacy is harder than it sounds.

Most voice note apps? They upload everything. Not SpeakSummarize.

**Here's how it works:**

* You record. Everything stays on YOUR device.
* We never see your audio. Ever.
* Cloud only stores anonymized vectors (can't be reversed to audio)
* App is tiny (6MB) because the heavy lifting happens in the cloud, not your phone

**What you get:**

* Instant transcription + AI summaries
* Searchable notes across months
* Ask Echo: ""What did Sarah say about the deadline?"" (finds it instantly)
* Auto-extracted action items
* Works in 28 transcription languages

**The catch?** There isn't one. But there is a **lifetime deal: $39.99** (was going to be $99.99).

Pay once. No subscriptions. No recurring charges. Lifetime access.

(Monthly is $4.99 if you prefer flexibility.)

**Why I built this:** Recording voice notes is easy. Finding them later? Impossible. I got tired of having 100 voice memos and no way to search them.

**Privacy is the feature:**

* No account required
* No tracking
* No data selling
* All encryption happens locally
* Delete anytime, everything's gone

What are your cozy games recs when you want something a bit more stimulating than a sim/farming game?
I dislike fighting & combat but I do occasionally need something a bit more challenging than a work at your own pace farming game.
The challenge can come from time management, organization/optimization, grinding for a skill tree, or just the sheer # of tasks that need completing.
Similar games I would classify as cozy chaos would be overcooked, plateup, coffee caravan (these examples are mostly tine management focused but I'm definitely open to other options).

I hope someone might have experience or tips to share; whenever I do my PT’s I’m not sure why but I zone out or just get brain fog. I’m not really sure how to explain it but I guess my mind wanders off and it could potentially be fatigue or maybe I have ADHD I have no clue. I’ve done the LSAT once so far and I don’t drink coffee or energy drinks but during the the LSAT I did drink coffee with a shot of espresso in it and on the first section I was just regular like doing a PT but second section I felt like I just went into autopilot mode and blinked and the time was done and I filled everything in with full confidence. Idk what the word is for that feeling lol someone please let me know, but is there anything that would get me to that level of focus again? Should I take those energy drinks like monster or Celsius?

1pm5odo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TugboatMacAbernathey/comments/1pm5odo/the_foam_sees/,The Foam Sees,"We were already in Manila by the time the frog started to sweat. Jimmy Funk held the capsule in his lap, wiping condensation from its lid with the hem of his tropical fruit-themed bowler shirt.

“Is it supposed to be glowing yet?” he asked, peering at me above his foggy, horn-rimmed glasses, and under the brim of a straw farmer’s hat.

“Not unless we’re being followed,” I said, checking the rearview mirror of the taxi. The driver was asleep but somehow navigated through the crowded street.

Our goal was simple, supposedly: deliver the frog to the hotel near the Mall of Asia. No further details. Well, maybe a few, but we hardly understood:

“If it sings, run. If it winks, stay still. And don’t drink the chocolate beer.”

Jimmy Funk and I had laughed, then. We weren’t laughing now.

The taxi stopped in front of a building that hadn’t been there ten seconds ago. An old mid-rise with no name, just an engraving of an upside-down question mark over the door.

“This it?” Jimmy Funk asked.

We hurried out of the cab. The driver woke up and started cursing at us in my grandmother’s voice, but in a language she never knew existed.

Jimmy Funk put the frog capsule in his pocket. I had asked him not to, but he insisted it “made his sternum feel complete.”

Well-dressed agents of the Republic of Korea’s National Intelligence Service swarmed us from multiple, but not all, directions as we walked into the hotel lobby.

“Geh-goo-ree! Geh-goo-ree!” they quietly said to one another as they approached.

I only know about four words in Korean. “Frog” is one of them. Don’t ask why. You don’t want to know.

Jimmy Funk, yes, THAT Jimmy Funk, world-famous thespian, was taking a selfie with a fan when the agents surrounded us. The teenage fan disappeared. Literally. They were a ghost, probably.

The agents bowed with respect, to the frog, not us. Though they dared not touch it.

They formed a protective human wall around us, and we were ushered to a secret escalator. They hit no buttons, but it began to move without direction.

We stopped on the fourth floor. The NIS agents held their breath. They were tetraphobic.

Jimmy Funk knew cues better than anyone. I followed him out of the elevator, he had the frog, after all.

The elevator door closed and we were quickly alone. Jimmy Funk, me, and the frog.

Luckily, we needed no further cues. The elevator opened to a penthouse. No room guessing games for us.

I had a mean case of swamp ass from the tropical heat, so I went to clean up in the waterfall shower overlooking the Mall of Asia. I think it was a one-way view. I hope so, anyhow.

When I came out of the bathroom, the frog capsule was on a banana-shaped coffee table… but Jimmy Funk was gone.

I found him hours later on the balcony, dazed, his ridiculous moustache sticky with something brown.

“There’s a place downstairs,” he said, breathing heavily. “Chocolate beer. No tap. It just… appears. You think a mood, and it bubbles up.”

“You drank it?”

“Twice.”

“Jimmy Funk…”

“I know what they said. But listen… it’s not a drink. It’s a memory. You taste things that never happened.”

The frog glowed in its capsule, atop a shelf made from the plank of a haunted Chinese pirate ship (well, a replica).

The second day, Jimmy Funk vanished again. This time for a lot longer.

Become a member
The frog began glowing while looking at itself in a mirror that once belonged to Ferdinand Magellan.

I studied the oddly rhythmic blinking.
“Morse toad… I mean code.”

The frog did not laugh, but the parrot did.

I took the laminated Morse code card from my pocket. Good thing I always carried at least one.

THEY HAVE HIM. STOP DRINKING. THE FOAM SEES.

That night, I left the frog in the care of the penthouse tailor and secretly followed Jimmy Funk on his mysterious journey.

He walked through a hallway that hadn’t existed when we checked in. The air grew cooler the deeper I went, the walls narrowing until it felt like I was walking inside a hamster tube.

He passed through a door marked only with a chalk symbol , a backwards ampersand that looked like melting wax.

I followed.
Well, I tried… but I walked into the wall.

The hallway collapsed behind me.

I returned to the room. The tailor was gone. The cobbler was gone. The frog was gone.

In its place: a single napkin, chocolate-stained, folded neatly.

“Funk has been resettled. You’ll forget soon.”

Frogless, I left the hotel at dawn.

A jeepney somehow dropped me at the airport, even though I never told the driver where I was going.

On the plane, not sure where it was bound, the in-seat menu had only three options:

Chocolate Beer (Warm)
Chocolate Beer (Cold)
Chocolate Beer (Mood-Based)

I declined.
I was still whole then.

Three years later, at the foot of Mount Fuji, I was selling vintage padlocks to tourists (without a license, sshh).

One rainy afternoon, I saw Jimmy Funk again. Or a version of him. He was carrying the cutest frog umbrella.

“You found me” he declared stoically upon approaching me.

“Is it really you?”

“I’m one of them,” he replied. “Maybe the original. Maybe not.”

“What happened to the frog?”

“The real one or the decoy?”

“Which one did we have?”

Jimmy Funk smiled.
“It’s not really chocolate beer. It’s the memory of who you could’ve been, fermented. Every time you drink it, you make a choice. And every choice leaves something behind.”

“I never drank it,” I said.

He tipped his top hat to me.
“Then you’re probably still whole.”

A pause.
The wind shifted.
His spectacles shimmered like a mirror.
Jimmy stood on his tip-toes and vanished for a split second.

“One more thing,” he added.
“You never actually left the hotel.”

I opened my mouth to speak…

1pm5ils,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1pm5ils/am_i_just_overreacting/,Am I just overreacting?,"So, for context, me and my step dad get along.. alright? I'm not sure. Like, we can go and get Christmas presents for my mom and it'll be alright! But other times, he will hit my hand with a pencil for my shadow getting too close to his drawing in a board game. He has made jokes about abuse before as well. I don't know if I'm just paranoid, but I just feel.. worried. There are some speech patterns I say frequently, but he ended up just telling me not to say them at all when I was talking to some family members. I have tried to just state my thoughts or my honest opinion, but then he would just tell me to stop talking back. Or, one time, me and him went to get some food. He had planned to get a drink for him and my mom at a coffee place. I saw they had sugar cookies so I asked if I could get one. Its a bit foggy looking back on that memory now, but I remember him calling me selfish. I couldn't find anywhere else to talk about it, so I just wanted to say it here. 

I'm alright with him having flaws, but some of it just upsets me. The examples of those are in the first paragraph. I have had some negative people in my life a few times, but for one I was close with, I did not see the signs, at all. Which, just makes me feel worried. **Is it alright to feel like he's been being a jerk, or am I just overreacting?**",2,1765687607.0,teenagers,2,1.0,False

Looked around and went around the back where nobody passes by and my golly! A Fuji Royal R220 just sitting on a rusty shelf! Took it out and asked the attendant to test it out and it doesnt wind up, was thinking in my mind maybe theres just stuck old beans or a faulty motor. Asked for its priced and just gave it for 8.50$! (Converted from 500php) Didnt think twice and paid for it and had kit packed. Went home and disassembled and whole beans where just dropping everywhere, internals are in a really bad form with some rust and old bean residue. Cleaned the internals with citric acid, assembled it again, tested it and it worked! Calibrated the burrs to zero and seasoned it with stale beans. This morning, finally tested it, compared it to my trusty C3 Pro with the same settings and the difference is night and day! The R220 is really bright and clear, you can taste everything on its own, the separation of the beans’ flavor is insane! Dont get me wrong, the C3 Pro is tasteful but its profile compared to the R220 is kinda cloudy/muddy. Ghost burr grinders are really worth it! ",40,1765687549.0,pourover,13,0.98,False

We’re taking a family trip in Jan and I am a little apprehensive. We did the same cruise for a shorter duration about 10 years ago. 

My type of fun is chilling, reading, coffee, walking, being in the *woods* - I genuinely don’t like the beach, and really the pool for that matter. All I remember from last time is people being drunk at the pool, and no space to lounge. 

I know I sound like a MAJOR party pooper and there is probably so much more to a cruise than I know. I am just thinking about the last cruise I went on. 

I was seasick, I didn’t want to wear “church clothes” every night to dinner (for me this was a dress). 

I really have a normal routine at home and the thought of being trapped on a boat is stressing me out. 

I really want to have fun and be pleasant on this trip and not complain, because my dad is especially excited. I’m coming prepared with plenty of prescribed zofran to combat the seasickness. It is my goal to be an enjoyable and appreciative family member. 

Do you guys have any tips for someone who is more of a homebody and not really a beach loving person? ",2,1765686964.0,celebritycruises,11,0.63,False

1pm54up,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1pm54up/dealing_with_a_wife_that_is_always_sick_but_not/,Dealing with a wife that is always sick but not diagnosed,"Genuinely asking this question of other 30-something dads in the messy middle. I’m hoping I’m not a lunatic and there is atleast another relationship dynamic out there that mirrors ours:

Is your spouse perpetually sick? I’m not talking disabilities, medically diagnosed lingering issues or mental disorders (hate the word). I’m talking about a perfectly healthy 25yr old who is now a 35yr old and has never, not once, been diagnosed with anything other than contagious infections. That’s a lie. She was “diagnosed” by her primary doctor for mild anxiety and depression but getting low dose sertraline prescribed in my experience only requires ticking off some eval questions with no fuss.

Ever since I moved in with her, I can’t recall a single month in a decade where she wasn’t sick. Headache, migraine, flu, COVID, lymph nodes, PPD, severe periods you name it. We’ve even had our fair share of mystery illnesses like when she felt she couldn’t breath but the lung screening came back like that of a career sprinter.

I know we love our wives in sickness and in health but I can’t recall any health at all. I spent the latter part of my 20s and now early 30s diagnosing stream upon stream of illnesses. She has even stopped using the “low immunity” explanation herself cause all her bloodwork always come out sparkly clean (no vitamin D or iron deficiency even!). This isn’t a big deal on the surface but overtime these bouts of sickness have had 3 lasting effects:

1. She doesn’t have any plans for life. With I met her she didn’t have a lot going on either (wanted to own a coffee shop but had never googled how to do it) and worked as a part time teller part time retail store helper. She had no plans for motherhood either but put what was of her career aside for the past 2 years to raise our kids. Complains and hates it but still doesn’t have a plan on how to make enough to cover the cost of ONE daycare tuition. Being sick keeps her firmly in survival mode most of the week so any future planning is mostly hopeful dreaming. 
2. I’ve changed as a person. I moved to the States for her, but we hardly ever travel or do outdoorsy things like I’d always hoped we would. Over time I’ve dropped my ambitions too and gone from a total socialite to a weekend at home guy. My own friends don’t recognize me anymore but I only see them once a year when I make the trip back. Our social life is near zero.
3. It’s easy to show up for your partner on a sick day with nice warm soup and some pampering to show how much you care. It’s near impossible (for me) to prove I’m a loving husband 7 days a week when I myself am waking up dreading the new ailments at our door today. Overtime I’ve grown distant from her sick needs because she refuses to treat them seriously enough to visit ER but seriously enough to complain if I’m not constantly worrying about her or prioritizing her.


I know I sound like a douche. But having spent a decade living with someone who may as well be on long term disability without a diagnosis is killing me bit by bit.

What do I do? If I continue the path I’m on we’ll be divorced in 5 years and I’ll be the emotionless heartless man stereotype. If I commit to managing her health I’ll become a father figure for her instead of a husband (she hates when I ask her if she takes meds but she misses antibiotics and antidepressants all the time). If I fake concern I’ll be caught eventually.

1pm54pt,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1pm54pt/how_to_choose_coffee_beans_that_actually_match/,How to Choose Coffee Beans That Actually Match Your Taste and Brewing Style,"When coffee tastes sour, bitter, flat, or just wrong, the problem usually isn’t the brewer—it’s the beans. One of the most common mistakes is buying coffee arbitrarily, assuming any bag will work with any setup. **When the beans don’t match your taste preferences or brewing method**, you end up trying to fix the problem with grind changes and brew tweaks, wasting time and coffee without ever fixing the core issue.

Freshness is another frequent trap. Many people unknowingly buy coffee that’s already past its peak because the bag only shows an expiry date. Brewing stale beans often leads to cups that taste hollow, papery, or aggressively bitter, which people then mistake for poor technique. No adjustment can bring back sweetness and aroma once the coffee has gone flat.

Misunderstanding labels causes even more frustration. Words like **single origin**, **washed**, **natural**, or **honey processed** are often ignored or misunderstood, leading to flavor mismatches. Someone expecting a *smooth*, *chocolatey cup* might end up with a *sharp*, *acidic coffee* and assume it’s low quality, when in reality it’s just the wrong style for their palate. The same happens with **origin** and **roast level**—bright African coffees or lightly roasted beans are often blamed for tasting “sour” when they’re simply being brewed by someone who prefers darker, heavier profiles.

Brewing method mistakes compound the problem. Light roasts can taste thin or sour when forced into espresso without adjustment, while dark roasts can taste harsh and bitter when brewed as pour-over or filter. Even high-quality beans will disappoint if they’re used in a way they weren’t intended for, leading many people to write off entire origins or roast levels unnecessarily.

The fix is **choosing beans with intention**. *Look for a clear roast date*, *use processing methods and origin as clues to flavor*, and *match the roast level to how you brew*. When the beans, your taste, and your brewing method line up, most of the common problems disappear—and coffee becomes far more **consistent**, **enjoyable**, and **waste-free**.

If you would like to know more about **freshness**, **coffee variety**, **origin**, **processing methods**, and **how to match beans to your brewing method,** you can read this blog post 👉[How to Choose the Right Coffee Beans for Your Brew](https://betterhomecoffee.computingexplained.org/coffee-beans/how-to-choose-the-right-coffee-beans-for-your-brew)",0,1765686316.0,IndiaCoffee,0,0.43,False
