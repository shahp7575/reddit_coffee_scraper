Date: Sunday, August 24, 2025

I found it sad that I had to go over what a boundary is for someone (myself, in this situation) to someone who is supposed to love me and be my family. 

Here’s what happened:

It was just my sister and me awake. We had just gotten back from walking the dogs to go potty. She knew that I would be leaving soon to meet up with someone, since I already had plans. We chit-chatted a bit about the coffee machine, and then she randomly asked, “Are you going to bring (my dog) with you?”

I said, “Yeah, of course!"" as I was packing up some of his things. She then invited me to church, saying, “You should go to church with me!”

I kindly declined, saying, “No thanks.”

She pressed, “but Why?!”

I answered, “Because I have things I need to do today before I go, and I’m packing up, getting ready to leave.”

⸻

##Boundaries

As I continued moving my laundry to the dryer, I calmly said, “Boundaries, *(sister's name)*. You need to understand that when someone says *no*, that *no* is an answer.”

She got frustrated, raising her pitch and tone higher. She argued, “That’s not an answer! That’s just an excuse!!!"" 

I calmly, *even happily*, reminded her: “No means no, *(sister's name)*.” — standing firm on that. 

She continued to press on and repeat herself over and over, saying, “An hour!? You won’t even spend an hour and go to church with me?!” Repeating and repeating—she would not stop.

At that point, I finished with the laundry, finished what I was doing, and walked away. I physically removed myself back to my space. I didn’t respond and continued to ignore her.

Because—*saying no is an answer*. It’s also a boundary. 
###You don’t have to give an explanation for your “no.” 

Sure, I explained this time, but — 
###I didn’t need to.

##When you’re setting firm boundaries with someone who doesn’t respect them, it’s best to stay as calm as possible. Stand firm, and don’t budge. Don’t even continue explaining—it’s futile.

⸻

I find it sad that my family, like my sister (and even my mom and dad), all struggle with respecting others’ boundaries. They have a very hard time hearing the word ""no"" as an answer.

Some people never learn this, and they can go their whole lives disrespecting everyone around them. To me, it became more apparent that *I had to stand firm* and explain:
“No is an answer. No means no.”

Because that is important to know. Especially someone who says they love you... especially for family. They need to know that respecting boundaries is basic decency for someone you care about. 

It’s sad that a 30+year old, and even a 50+year old, may never truly learn what boundaries are. My mother struggles with this, too. Honestly, I think my whole family struggles with it.

I pray that they finally learn before they continue to break down and try dominating anyone and everyone in their lives... 

And I will continue to be strong, setting healthy boundaries and not faltering. You should too, reader. ",1,1756051795.0,narcissisticparents,0,1.0,False

I never thought thought it was anxiety related because I do have chronic illnesses that cause similar symptoms but these episodes were always different. And after being medically gaslit by doctors who tried to pin my illness on anxiety when it really wasn't, I hate thinking that I might actually have some form of anxiety. But I do have PTSD diagnosed young. My symptoms have been getting worse since over the years since I turned 18 and I'm not sure why.

They come on for no reason and it's not like I'm worried or anxious about anything during it besides how I must look shaking so bad and acting off and worry about why I can't just continue to function and when the episode will be over. But nothing specific triggers it I'll just be absolutely fine in the middle of a work day and then boom I suddenly can't even pour a coffee because I get sudden extreme tremors and feel disconnected to my body and can't even see straight. 

I'm wondering if the affect that trauma has on the nervous system can cause random panic attacks like this and if anyone else gets them for no reason. It's not like anything related to my trauma is triggering it but maybe it's just my nervous system being wacky. 

My chronic illnesses also affects my autonomic nervous system and causes adrenaline dumps so maybe it's a mix of both just taking a toll on my nervous system and causing these episodes?",1,1756051785.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

1myzj6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1myzj6a/my_25f_relationship_with_my_coworker_35m_left_me/,"My (25F) relationship with my coworker (35M) left me confused, anxious and traumatized- was it me or him?","Hi everyone, I really need an outside perspective on my breakup because I feel stuck, guilty, and unable to move on.

I dated a coworker who is 10 years older than me. From the start he was very affectionate, charming, and good with words. He told me I was his “perfect match”, checked all of the boxes, he wanted to get married. I always told him I needed time to get to know him better, but he pushed the idea that he already knew I was the one. In the beginning I thought he was a fboy but he said “I never do one-night stands - I’m a “relationship guy,” and that he only dates seriously so I took him seriously.

He made me open up and I told him early on about my vulnerabilities and talked about my family issues and low self-esteem, that I have attachment issues and fear of abandonment. He reassured me by saying: “Don’t worry, I’ve never broken up with anyone”, “We will work on you together”. He told me everything I ever wanted to hear. At the time, that made me feel safe — but in the end, he did break up with me and never lived up to anything he said.

He introduced me to his parents and extended family (I even went to his aunt’s birthday — apparently the first girlfriend ever invited), and after only 3 months he talked about moving in together. He even showed me an engagement ring, which was the same ring from his ex-fiancée. When I told him I didn’t want that same ring, he got angry.

He told me about his past: 16 relationships before me, with 7 women supposedly cheating on him. He was engaged once but the last year of that relationship was not good and he called her a manipulative narcissist. He told me girls had used him and his money a lot in the past because he is too nice and helpful.

Something else to note: he was very stressed about his age and wanting kids as soon as possible. He made comments about running out of time and pressured the idea of marriage and children quickly. If it wouldn’t work out with me he would continue to look for the “right person”.

In the beginning, he promised dates and traveling, but apart from the first candlelit dinner at home, he never took me out. The few times we went for coffee or lunch after or during work, he told me those counted as “dates” and that I should stop asking for more. He never got me flowers (I’m not materialistic, but I wanted some romantic effort). Whenever I expressed my needs, he would tell me I was “never satisfied.” He also seemed stingy with money — he often talked about it which made it obvious.

He always involved his sister and best friend in our relationship; every issue we had, he discussed with them, and often acted based on their opinions instead of his own. They never got to hear my perspective of things. I wish I had realized this earlier and told him and his sister.

Sex was another huge pressure point. Our sexual chemistry was insane, but I never trusted him enough to sleep with him — I’m very cautious with that since I’m really emotional. Still, he gave me a deadline — if I didn’t sleep with him by then, he would break up with me. I also discovered he had a lot of sex toys and condoms at home, which made me feel like sex was a much bigger focus for him than emotional connection. I would be fine with all of it if he had just put more effort.

Even though I initially didn’t want to date anyone from the office (because I feared it would be uncomfortable if things didn’t work out), he persuaded me otherwise. He told me I didn’t trust him enough, and even said he would change jobs for me — which convinced me to give it a try. But despite all his reassurances, I had a gut feeling from the very beginning that something wasn’t right. That feeling never went away.

As the relationship went on, he withdrew more and more. He only wanted to stay home, watch TV, cuddle, and then go back to work or gaming. He was usually too tired after work to do anything. I felt like we were in a marriage after only a few months. He knew I had an active lifestyle and loved to do outside activities. Meanwhile, my anxiety got worse. In my head his texts became slower and colder compared to the beginning, and I started overthinking every message. I panicked when he didn’t reply, got angry when I felt ignored, and constantly needed reassurance.

I’ll admit I got reactive. Once, after a long day of barely hearing from him, I snapped and told him to “just get married to your game and make a family with it”. He broke up with me immediately, called me immature, and said he couldn’t deal with me anymore. I begged him to stay, promised I’d change, and apologized — and we got back together. But the cycle of me wanting more and him giving less never really stopped.

Sometimes he lashed out too. Once he removed me on Snapchat (the only place we communicate) out of irritation, another time he said “fuck you,” and another time he told me he was “so damn sick” of me. I wanted to keep in touch a lot and he said “go get a hobby, you’re obsessed with me”.

Whenever I tried to express my feelings I felt neglected or I was the one saying sorry(?) and it became harder for me to open up. I came to the conclusion that whenever I acted cold or distant he would show me affection but I couldn’t deal with that push and pull dynamic so I wrote paragraphs telling him how unloved, un prioritized and lonely I felt.

The breakup was sudden and messy. He ended it over SMS — saying we weren’t compatible and he wasn’t the right guy for me. After that, everything escalated. I had bought a computer through his friend, and when it was time for me to pay for the computer my ex suddenly switched 180: threatening me, calling my friend, and even getting his sister to write to me because I took a lot of time to pay back. Eventually, he blocked me everywhere.

It’s been 9 months since. We have never spoken and I’m still blocked. We see each other at work sometimes. His friends also work there so I’m always on guard. It’s impossible to stop over analyzing him or his friends and stop thinking about him overall. Recently, he even sent me a random work-related message that wasn’t really necessary, which just left me even more confused. I don’t know why I’m still attached to him.

Through all of this, the biggest thing I can’t shake is that his actions never matched his words. He promised me love, marriage, family, consistency — but what I got was withdrawal, avoidance, and eventually rejection. That mismatch is what has left me so confused and hurt.

I feel traumatized, like I can’t function without his presence. Being alone feels harder than before, and I constantly imagine him giving the love, effort, and romance I wanted to someone else. I keep wondering if I self-sabotaged the relationship with my reactivity and overthinking, or if he was emotionally unavailable, manipulative, and just not capable of real intimacy.

My questions are: •	Did I ruin this by being too reactive and needy? •	Why was he so affectionate and serious in the beginning, then withdraw more and more? •	Is it possible for someone like him (busy, gaming-focused, relying on family/friends for decisions, stingy with money, rushing marriage/kids) to actually have a long-term healthy relationship? •	How do I stop feeling like I wasn’t “good enough” and that he’ll give my dream relationship to the next person?

TL;DR: I (25F) dated a coworker (35M) who was initially affectionate, charming, and talked about marriage and family early on. He pressured intimacy, involved his family and friends in our relationship, and often made me feel unloved or “never satisfied.” He became increasingly withdrawn, stingy with effort, and emotionally unavailable. Our relationship had a push-pull dynamic, and he eventually broke up with me abruptly over SMS. Eight months later, I’m still traumatized, overanalyzing, and struggling with attachment, wondering if it was my reactivity or his emotional unavailability that caused the breakup.",1,1756051477.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Sample 1300 Calorie Day Meal Plan: Tips for Successfully Managing Your Daily Intake
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're aiming for a 1300 calorie meal plan, you're likely focused on weight management or healthy eating. Crafting a balanced and fulfilling meal plan can help you achieve your goals while ensuring you stay energized throughout the day. Below is a sample meal plan along with tips for making it work for you. This plan includes breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks to keep you satisfied.

### Sample Meal Plan

#### Breakfast (350 calories)

- 1 slice of whole-grain toast (80 calories)
- 1 tablespoon of almond butter (95 calories)
- 1 small banana (90 calories)
- 1 cup of black coffee or tea (0 calories)
- 1/2 cup of low-fat Greek yogurt (85 calories)

This delicious breakfast balances healthy fats from almond butter with protein from yogurt, setting a positive tone for your day.

#### Mid-Morning Snack (100 calories)

- 1 medium apple (95 calories)
- 5 almonds (35 calories)

Snacking on fruit like apples not only satisfies your sweet tooth but also provides fiber, making you feel full longer.

#### Lunch (350 calories)

- 2 cups of mixed greens (10 calories)
- 1/2 cup of cherry tomatoes (15 calories)
- 1/4 of an avocado (80 calories)
- 4 ounces of grilled chicken breast (180 calories)
- 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinaigrette (60 calories)

A fresh salad with lean protein helps in maintaining a balanced diet, giving your body essential nutrients while keeping calorie intake in check.

#### Afternoon Snack (150 calories)

- 1 plain rice cake (35 calories)
- 2 tablespoons of hummus (70 calories)
- Carrot sticks (45 calories)

This light yet nourishing snack keeps you energized and helps prevent overeating during dinner.

#### Dinner (350 calories)

- 3 ounces of grilled salmon (200 calories)
- 1 cup of steamed broccoli (55 calories)
- 1/2 cup of quinoa (110 calories)

Eating fish like salmon offers heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids, and pairing it with vegetables and whole grains rounds out your meal nicely.

### Tips for Success

Managing your daily intake effectively is crucial when following a 1300 calorie meal plan. Here are some strategies to help you succeed:

- **Stay Hydrated:** Drinking enough water throughout the day can help manage hunger. Try to drink at least 8 cups of water daily.
- **Plan Ahead:** Prepping your meals in advance can prevent unhealthy snacking. Spend some time weekly planning your meals and snacks.
- **Balance Your Plate:** Aim for meals that include protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates to create a filling experience.
- **Listen to Your Body:** Pay attention to hunger cues. Eating mindfully helps avoid the risk of overeating.
- **Be Flexible:** If you're feeling hungry, consider adjusting portions while keeping the overall calorie count in mind.

### Track Your Progress

Using a food diary or app can be beneficial. Logging meals can help you stay on track and see where you can make adjustments. Monitor how your body feels as you adapt to this meal plan. With practice and patience, you can successfully manage your daily calorie intake while enjoying a variety of foods.

Remember, a 1300 calorie meal plan is just one way to approach healthy eating. Always consider your unique health needs, and consult with a healthcare provider or a nutritionist for personalized advice. With dedication and care, you'll find a meal strategy that works for you!

The Benefits of Structured Meal Plans for Weight Loss and Maintenance
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a structured meal plan can be a game changer in your weight loss journey. By organizing what you eat, you not only simplify your daily choices but also align your meals with your health goals. Let’s explore how structured meal plans can help you not just lose weight but also maintain a healthy lifestyle.

One of the main benefits of having a structured meal plan is the control it gives you over your calorie intake. When you plan your meals ahead of time, you’re less likely to reach for unhealthy snacks or fast food out of convenience. Instead, you can prepare healthy meals that fit your calorie targets. This controlled intake supports weight loss by creating a calorie deficit, which is crucial for shedding pounds.

Additionally, meal planning empowers you to make healthier food choices. When you take the time to think about what you’re going to eat, you can prioritize whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats. This reduces the temptation to indulge in processed or sugary foods. As a result, you’ll likely find it easier to maintain energy levels and stay satisfied throughout the day.

Another significant advantage of structured meal plans is that they save you time. Once your meals are planned out, grocery shopping becomes a breeze. You can create a shopping list based on your meal plan, which minimizes impulse buys and ensures you have everything you need. Meal preparation also becomes more efficient; you can cook in batches and portion out your meals for the week, making it simpler to stick to your diet.

Budgeting is also much easier with a structured meal plan. When you know what you’ll be eating, you can buy in bulk and select ingredients that give you the best bang for your buck. This not only supports your weight loss efforts but also helps you avoid overspending on groceries.

For those struggling with discipline in their eating habits, meal planning offers a structured approach that can cultivate better habits. By setting aside a specific time each week to plan your meals, you begin to build a routine around your eating. This not only keeps you accountable but also instills a sense of commitment to your health.

The predictability of a meal plan also provides mental clarity. Rather than facing daily decisions about what to eat, knowing what is on your plate takes away the guesswork, making you less likely to resort to unhealthy choices. This structured approach can significantly reduce stress around meal times.

- **Control over Calorie Intake:** Helps create a calorie deficit.
- **Healthier Food Choices:** Promotes whole food consumption.
- **Time-Saving:** Simplifies grocery shopping and meal prep.
- **Budget-Friendly:** Allows for bulk purchases and reduces waste.
- **Builds Discipline:** Cultivates a routine around eating habits.
- **Mental Clarity:** Reduces decision fatigue around meals.

Structured meal plans especially benefit individuals who have busy lifestyles. With hectic schedules, you might find it hard to make healthy choices in the moment. Having a pre-set plan means that you’ll always have nutritious options ready when life gets busy, ensuring that you stay on track.

Moreover, meal planning can facilitate weight maintenance once you’ve reached your goals. After shedding those extra pounds, many individuals struggle with keeping the weight off. A structured meal plan can help you maintain your ideal weight by continuing to guide your eating habits and keeping you aware of portion sizes.

Remember that consistency is key. While having a structured meal plan is essential, it's equally important to listen to your body’s needs. You might encounter days when you crave something different or feel hungrier than usual. That’s perfectly okay! The goal is to create a flexible framework that works for you, rather than a rigid rulebook.

Embracing the advantages of a structured meal plan can lead to profound changes in your health and lifestyle. By providing control over your meals, supporting better food choices, saving time and money, and fostering a consistent routine, you set the stage for lasting success in your weight loss and maintenance journey. So why not take that first step and start planning your meals today?

### Conclusion

Creating a sample 1300 calorie day meal plan can be a powerful tool in your journey toward healthier eating and weight management. By carefully curating your meals and snacks, you can enjoy a variety of delicious foods while still maintaining a calorie deficit. This structured approach not only helps in managing your daily intake but also fosters a mindful relationship with food, allowing you to savor each bite, rather than resorting to mindless eating.

The benefits of a structured meal plan go beyond weight loss; they offer a roadmap to a balanced lifestyle. It brings clarity to your nutritional goals and helps you stay on track with your dietary preferences. Plus, as you follow a meal plan, you can anticipate your meals and snacks, reducing the temptation to make impulsive food choices that could derail your efforts.

Staying committed to a 1300 calorie plan encourages you to explore new recipes and ingredients, enhancing your culinary skills along the way. It can also motivate you to stock your kitchen with healthier options, making it easier to stick with your goals. Remember that flexibility is key; allow yourself occasional treats to avoid feelings of deprivation, which can lead to binge eating.

By embracing the concept of a meal plan tailored to 1300 calories, you empower yourself to take charge of your nutrition. The process can be enjoyable and fulfilling when you focus on the benefits, making it sustainable for the long term. With patience and dedication, you will find that not only is weight loss achievable, but it can also be a delightful part of your daily routine.

I also kept getting screened out due to my demographics but in the end I was able to prove that it truly pays. Best profiles are those who are usually married, in their 30's, got 2 kids, a car and a motorcycle, travels a lot, orders a lot of food and products online. If you plan on succeeding here, these are the examples of the target demographics of surveys. PayPal is the mode of redemption for your points.

Swertehan lng din na di screen out pero grabe mabilis din pala dito makakuha ng cash.
3. Test em All - App is decent and legit but has low payouts like the easiest to achieve would be around 0.10 Dollars with the highest for 4 Dollars. I rank this as decent because it has a much better selection of games plus matagal ang kanilang deadline of completion sa tasks although I noticed that for Android their tasks are easier with games requiring you to run them for a specific duration of minutes for points. Unlike IOS which I am unfortunate to have, where you have to accomplish tasks like reach this level or finish this level. I was able to cash out like 1 Dollar accumulated (0.20 for five times for an interval of 2-3 days playing to reach the required tasks) but still it definitely pays.
4. TopSurveys - This app is similar to PrimeOpinion and HeyCash. They offer stuff here for Dollars instead of redeemable points and much of the games on offer are the same ones as HeyCash and PrimeOpinion. Medyo matumal nga lang surveys dito so best tip here is to play games that you haven't played with HeyCash and PrimeOpinion since once you install the game on offer from one of these apps di na yan magtatrack kapag ininstall niyo ulit. I wasn't able to cash out yet since I was only able to accumulate around 3.7 of the required 5 Bucks minimum but I am hoping to finally do so I can give out more tips here.
5. Cash Giraffe - This app plays similar to Test em All and it has the same range of payouts. I got my first 0.20 after finishing a few levels from Goblin Miner. So far it is legit like Test em All but not reliable in terms of payouts. Best use both of these as extra on the side but never make it your primary beer money app.

So far this pretty much wraps up part 2 of my honest review and I hope this gives you guys a few more ideas and other ways to earn. Keep the discussions civil and share any other apps you would like to have reviewed by me. Cheers.",1,1756051213.0,beermoneyph,0,1.0,False

**Why This Pick?** 

The Orioles and the Astros have cashed the Over in all 3 games of this series so far; with the Astros having won 3/4, Baltimore will be eager to avoid a sweep. Today, they come to the mound with a substantial pitching advantage (Trevor Rogers, 1.41 ERA). Meanwhile, Spencer Arrighetti’s (6.94 ERA) last 4 straight starts have resulted in a loss for the Astros, and in all of those losses, Houston’s opponents managed to get at least 6 runs on the board. My money’s on the Orioles to follow suit today and put at least 5 in the bag.

**Important preamble**:

1. **Beware of cults.** This sounds like a joke, but I'm serious. There are a lot of religiously-oriented publishers here, and most of them are just normal religious practice that isn't ""cult-y"", but a few are, in my opinion, cults. Exercise your religious freedom, but stay safe out there, folks!!
2. **What is self-publishing?** I'm going to say self-published a lot here, so let's define it: in self-publishing, a publisher is paid by the author to publish their book. This is different from traditional publishing, where the publisher pays to publish the book and collects royalties from every book sold.  I don't know if these self-publishing services are here to sell the books they've published or here to sell their services to aspiring authors, or both. There are people who have found success from self-publishing, but at the same time, when I looked up some of these companies I got reddit threads complaining that they were scammers.  I'm not saying all the self-publishing services are scammers, but just be careful with your money if you want to self-publish a book. 
3.  **Many of these will not interest you, the individual reader**. A bunch of vendors who are systems or wholesale distribution directly to big institutions, not to individual readers, so there are probably a bunch of booths you can safely ignore unless you're there as the representative of a company that can use that system.

**List of vendors**: all mistakes are my own, please let me know if I've missed someone or I got the summary wrong

**[19th Avenida](https://www.instagram.com/myavenidaph)** - Filipino publishing house.

1myz7lu,https://i.redd.it/jvgtx1khozkf1.jpeg,Looking for a link to Marked and Mended by Ada Wong,"The night I came into the world, a luminous full moon dominated the sky, casting its silvery glow over the forest surrounding our pack territory. My mother, Ambrienne, is the esteemed Luna of the Argent Lune pack—a figure of strength, elegance, and an unyielding warrior spirit. She stands as an equal to my father, the Alpha, embodying everything a mate should be. Years before my birth, she gives him their first child, my sister Sabeline, a shining beacon in our family.

Sabeline inherits my mother’s radiant beauty—the kind that stops people in their tracks. Her fiery red hair gleams like embers, and her green eyes shimmer brighter than polished emeralds under the sunlight. Even as a ten-year-old, she towers above most of her peers, her intelligence matching the grace and strength she displays both in her studies and during training. In our community, where strength and intellect are prized above all, Sabeline is the epitome of perfection.

Yet, even with his ""star child,"" my father grows ecstatic when he learns my mother carries another life within her—or rather, two lives. Twins. A rarity in the werewolf world. Our kind births larger-than-average offspring, and twins push the odds even further. The stories told around the pack speak of how my father can barely contain his joy; he worships my mother throughout the pregnancy. Each night, he massages her feet, ensuring no discomfort clouds her days. No craving goes unfulfilled. Her happiness is his priority, his devotion unwavering. But joy has a way of twisting unexpectedly into sorrow.

The prospect of the Luna giving birth to twins enraptures the Argent Lune pack. Excitement buzzes through every wolf in the territory. When the full moon rises, bathing the forest in ethereal light, and my mother goes into labor, it feels like divine timing. Pack members gather in celebration, their howls rising through the night air as offerings of gratitude to the Moon Goddess.

But divine moments often demand sacrifice. My mother struggles through her labor, a battle as fierce as any fought on the field. The midwife pleads with her, urging her on, begging her to push harder. Each contraction rips through her body. My father is outside, pacing the perimeter of the pack house like a caged beast. As her true mate, he feels her agony as if it were his own. Every pang of pain and surge of effort connects them, his worry pouring into every frantic step he takes.

My brother is the first to arrive. But his story is shrouded in mystery, whispered among the pack members in conflicted tones. Some say he never takes a breath, that he enters the world lifeless. Others swear he inhales, if only for a fleeting second, before death claims him. What cannot be disputed is the final truth: he dies. That fact alone marks the turning point of my life. The weight of his death falls squarely on me, his surviving twin.

From that moment on, I become the scapegoat. The child who lives when another does not. My father, the pack, and even the whispers of the wind seem to call me one thing: monster. A murderer before I even know what it means.

Chapter 2

The sky hasn’t even started to lighten when I open my eyes. My eighteenth birthday has arrived, but it’s not a day worth celebrating—not for me. For most people, it might mark freedom, excitement, or new beginnings. But my life doesn’t shift with the calendar. Today promises to be nothing more than a rerun of yesterday.

I groan and roll off the makeshift mattress I’ve pieced together on the floor of my small room. Padding over to the creaky sink, I splash cold water on my face, hoping it will shake the weight of exhaustion clinging to me. When I catch my reflection in the mirror above, my eyes snag on the bluish marks fading along my neck. Ghosts of bruises, nearly gone now. The thin scar near my temple has already healed over. For just a moment, self-pity rears its head.

I don’t think I’m hideous, but standing here examining myself, it’s clear I’ll never hold a candle to my sister. She’s the beauty, the perfect one, the one people admire. Me? I’m short for my age, just a notch above plain, and while I’ve always been called ""fat,"" it’s ironic, really—I’m severely underweight, my bones pushing against my skin more visibly than they should. My mousy brown hair feels like a curse, limp and unimpressive, and I glare at my hazel eyes, silently wishing they sparkled with the vivid green my sister's do. When I feel the wave of bitterness creeping in, I force my thoughts to stop. It doesn’t make a difference anyway.

After a quick splash and one last frown at my reflection, I tug on an old T-shirt and a pair of worn-out sweatpants. There’s one part of the morning I will not let anyone—anything—take from me. My run. It’s the only thing that keeps me sane.

Tiptoeing down the back staircase of the pack house, I move as silently as I can. My heart starts to beat faster as I near the door. Outside, the woods are waiting for me. They’re alive, teeming, and I long to melt into their rhythm. I can already smell the earth, the decay of leaves, the faint sweetness of the pines. As soon as my feet touch the cool ground outside, I feel it—a stirring deep inside me. My wolf feels it too, clawing for release.

Sometimes I think of that first shift—the night it all changed for me. It happened earlier than it should have, when I was thirteen. Most wolves don’t shift until they’re sixteen, but my wolf came to me during one of my father’s drunken rages. That night was bad, sure—aren’t they all?—but it wasn’t the worst injury he’d dealt out. No broken bones that time, just chunks of hair ripped mercilessly from my scalp, leaving patches of raw skin behind. I remember sobbing quietly in the dark, trying to comfort myself, when I felt her rise within me. My wolf. She awakened to my pain, to my desperate need for protection, for healing. My first shift was excruciating. Every single bone cracked and reshaped, my body stretching and twisting into something new. Claws grew where fingers had been, and fur pushed through every inch of my skin. I’ll never forget it. The sheer sharpness of it, the beauty of it.

But I never breathed a word about it to anyone. I couldn’t. I learned young—joy and comfort in this house were dangerous luxuries. Still, after a few more shifts, the pain disappeared. Now? It’s almost euphoric.

The forest's edge looms closer, and the pull to let her out becomes harder to ignore. I suck in a deep breath, relishing the crispness of the mountain air. There’s a bite to it this morning, autumn slowly tightening its grip. It won’t be long before snow covers everything. I glance over my shoulder to make sure no one followed me. Not a sound, not a hint of movement. Safe. Finally.

Without hesitation, I pull my shirt over my head, followed by the sweatpants, and leave them for later. My wolf bursts free as soon as I let her, exploding into life with a weightless, primal joy. The scents of the forest hit me all at once, sharper and more vibrant than they are in my human form. Pine sap, damp earth, mushrooms swelling in the loamy soil, the fresh crispness of the river ahead. We race through it all, getting lost in the rhythm of paws against soil, wind rushing over fur, heart hammering with pure, unrestrained freedom.

We find the river in no time. It’s as perfect as always. I shift back, my human body sliding down the cool, gritty bank of the riverbed until my feet touch the icy water. Every nerve jolts awake at the shock of it. This is my favorite spot in the entire world. No question.

Sinking into the moment, I prop myself up on my elbows, dangling my toes in the freezing current. The woods hum around me—their quiet symphony of life waking up for the day. Birds stir in their nests, wings fluttering gently. A deep rustle across the riverbank catches my attention. I open my eyes slowly and spot her. A doe.

She stands there, breathtaking in her beauty. Her fur glows with a sun-kissed warmth, each movement elegant and measured. She sees me, I think, but there’s no fear in her large, dark eyes. Just wariness. I hold my breath, hoping she’ll stay, but after a moment, she bounds away, deeper into the trees. My chest tightens as I watch her disappear, a longing I can’t quite place coiling up inside me.

God, what I wouldn’t give to feel that kind of freedom.

The thought lingers, heavy, unshakable. I’ve thought about running before. Just taking off, leaving everything behind. But wolves like me don’t get that option. To leave is to be rogue, and rogues… rogues don’t last. Packs see them as threats, creatures too wild and unpredictable to live. They kill them on sight, and they don’t question it. It’s the natural order of things, or so they say. Order. Balance. Roles. A wolf without a pack disrupts all of that, and there’s no place for them. No safety.

I sigh, brushing dirt off the back of my legs as I stand. My time here is up. The house will be waking soon, and they’ll be waiting for breakfast—impatiently. If I’m late, their punishment will follow. And I can’t take another beating today, not on top of everything else.

Fate feels like an enemy I can’t fight, an opponent always one step ahead. I hate my role in life. Despise it. But there’s no changing who I am or what I’ve done. I’m the monster. And I’m the one who killed my brother.

Chapter 3

My wolf senses the dread pooling inside me as I make my way back home. She doesn’t revel in this journey—we both know what lies ahead. We’ve done this before, endured this countless times: the insults, the degrading looks, the pain. It’s just another day, another hollow wish to be anywhere but here. But today, today is different. Today reopens the deepest wound in this pack. My presence alone, walking through those doors, will remind everyone, especially my parents, of a truth they hate to face—that I am alive, and my brother is not.

Slipping in through the back door, I tread as lightly as I can. The goal is simple: stay unnoticed, avoid their wrath. The house feels unsettlingly quiet, and as long as it stays that way, I’m safe. I flip on the two large coffee makers in the kitchen and start pulling out the skillets. It’s time to prep breakfast.

The pack house isn’t crowded. Most of the pack members have their own homes scattered across our territory. Those who live here include my father, Alpha Jorvan, my mother, the Luna, the Beta and his mate, several elite warriors, my father’s advisory council—and me. Just me. My sister, Sabeline, lived here too, once upon a time, before she found her destined mate eight years ago. She left, of course, to start a new life with him along California’s coast.

Dorevian. Her mate. I hate him a little for taking her away. Even knowing how much he adores her, knowing he’d lay down his life for her, doesn’t erase the sting. Sabeline was the only person who ever showed me love, and she’s gone.

I shove those thoughts aside and hurry to work. There’s no time to dwell on memories when I have mouths to feed. The men of this house—strong warriors with bottomless appetites—demand a feast every morning. I whisk eggs into variety: scrambled with cheese, poached, sunny-side up. Bacon, sausage, and ham sizzle in their pans, filling the kitchen with a savory haze. Finally, I stack pancakes, one golden layer at a time.

I hear them before I see them. They’re gathering in the dining room now, their heavy steps and loud voices filling the once-quiet house. I brace myself. Coffee first. Always coffee first. My father prefers his black; my mother takes hers with cream. Years of silent observation have taught me their preferences. I deliver cups the way a servant might, head down, voice nonexistent. Quickly, quietly. The less time I spend in their presence, the lower my chances of getting struck or chastised.

“Delyra.”

My father’s voice freezes me mid-step. He doesn’t need to shout. The weight of his tone alone sends tremors through me. My hands shake as I turn, carefully keeping my gaze fixed on the floor. Out of everyone in this pack, it’s my father who inspires the most fear in me. His cruelty is unmatched, his punishments unrelenting, both in body and in spirit.

“Yes, Alpha,” I respond, my voice barely above a whisper, my eyes obediently lowered. It’s forbidden for me to make eye contact with any pack member. That’s how deep their hatred runs for me.

“We’ll have neighboring packs visiting tomorrow,” he announces. Every word feels calculated, deliberate. “This is an important meeting. I want this house spotless for their arrival. Three packs will be staying here. You’ll also prepare dinner for our esteemed guests. Make sure it’s perfect—or I’ll kill you in front of them for your disrespect. Do you understand?”

My throat tightens, but before I can answer, Beta Novar interjects.

“Alpha, with all due respect, this girl doesn’t have the capability to pull it off. She’s pathetic. Letting her near the kitchen for such an event would be a disgrace. I suggest we get the event catered.” Novar’s disdain for me is second only to my father’s, and he never misses an opportunity to vocalize it.

The insults keep coming, this time from my mother. “Novar’s right. She’s a disgrace. By the Goddess, just looking at her turns my stomach. I should’ve smothered her the day she was born.” Her words slice through me, as they always do, leaving wounds I’ve long since stopped trying to mend.

I stand rooted as my father deliberates their opinions. Only fear holds me up—I know how badly I’d fail if he leaves such an important meal in my hands. I’ve never entertained anyone outside our pack, aside from Sabeline’s mate when he’d passed through. This would be on a scale I couldn’t possibly manage.

“Fine,” my father says. Relief floods through me. “We’ll have the event catered. This is too important to risk.” For a brief moment, I breathe again.

But it’s short-lived. “Don’t think that spares you,” he growls. “You’ll still clean this place until it sparkles. Change all the spare bedroom linens. Make sure the pack meeting house is ready.”

I barely have time to nod when something hard hits me above the brow. A coffee cup. Warm blood drips down toward my eye as the sharp sting spreads across my forehead. My gaze stays on the floor.

“Yes, Alpha,” I whisper and shuffle back to the kitchen. I’ve learned not to cry over cuts or their venomous words. Tears only make them angrier. Tears bring worse punishment.

At the sink, I rinse the dishes and grab a towel to dab the blood from my face. Peering into the tea kettle’s reflection, I examine the gash. It’s shallow; it’ll heal soon enough. My hands move mechanically, scrubbing away at the endless aftermath of breakfast.

My thoughts wander despite myself. Why now? Why host an event after all this time? Normally, peace talks and trade negotiations happen outside our territory. We never play host.

Shaking the question from my head, I press on. The Alpha gave me my orders, and my day of cleaning has only just begun.

Chapter 4

Cleaning doesn’t bother me—it’s how I avoid pack members most of the time. Since I stay on top of it daily, there’s rarely a mountain of work waiting. The pack house, massive and slightly foreboding, has ten guest rooms, all of which remain empty. My routine begins with opening every window, letting in the crisp bite of mountain air that fills my lungs and clears my mind. The chore feels meditative, almost like a small act of rebellion. Changing the linens is easy enough. Each room has its own closet stocked neatly with fresh sheets, thanks to the Luna’s obsession with maintaining order and unity. She takes immense pride in every room having its own color palette, meticulously designed and flawlessly executed.

One room, though, speaks to me in ways the others don’t. On the southern side of the pack house, adorned in natural, soft greens, its windows frame the tops of the forest beyond. There’s a tranquility here that settles in my chest. I linger longer than I should, savoring the peace as I change out the linens and replace the towels in its attached washroom. But peace is fleeting. It shatters at the sound of voices drifting closer from the hall—Melisyn and Helethra.

Melisyn, the Beta’s wife, doesn’t carry the overt cruelty of my father or her husband, but kindness isn’t in her playbook either. And Helethra? She’s her father’s daughter in every way that counts: brutal, vindictive, and ruthless.

I stiffen at the sound of their chatter. Melisyn, my mother Ambrienne’s best friend, knows every corner of my family’s history. There’s gossip in the pack that she once harbored hopes of being my father’s mate—before my mother’s claim became official. Melisyn had been my mother’s maid of honor, even staying by her side during my sister’s birth. Their pregnancies mirrored one another, my mother expecting two children—me and my twin, Duskren—while Melisyn carried Helethra. Only four days separate our births, though our lives couldn’t be more different.

Helethra flaunts her beauty like a weapon, and it’s not hard to see why. Long legs, silken blonde hair, sculpted cheekbones, the hourglass figure men trip over themselves for—the Moon Goddess seems to have been partial to her. Unfortunately for the rest of us, beauty doesn’t go beyond her surface. To say she has it out for me would be an understatement. Helethra’s broken my nose more times than I care to count and enjoys spreading lies, painting a picture of me as the pack's resident slut. And the bitterness? It’s all rooted in her belief that my brother Duskren was meant to be her mate, a destiny I “took away.”

I freeze. Maybe if I stay quiet, they’ll pass by. Maybe I can slip into another room, unnoticed.

“Wear the red dress, Helethra. The one with the slit up the side,” Melisyn instructs, her voice laced with purpose.

“I know, Mom. Relax,” Helethra replies, her tone dripping with confidence. “By the end of the night, Cazriel will be mine. I’ve waited my whole life to be a Luna, and the Cobalt Summit Pack? It’s my destiny.”

“He hasn’t found his mate yet,” Melisyn reminds her, her voice tightening. “Your father says his favorite color is red. That’s all you need to know to make him fall for you. This chance is too important. The Mabon Ball is perfect. You can’t waste it.”

“Don’t worry, Mom. No man can resist me.” She says it with certainty, almost casual, but I know she’s not wrong. Not a single male in our pack has been immune to Helethra’s charms.

Their voices grow faint as they continue down the hallway. My shoulders sag in relief. Yet something sticks: Melisyn’s mention of the Mabon Ball. It’s a holiday for humans, marking the season’s harvest. For werewolves, it’s far more significant. Long nights mean better hunts, and the rare gatherings of multiple packs make it one of the only times destined mates cross borders and find each other. My pack has never hosted the event before, nor have I ever been permitted to attend.

The thought lingers for a moment before I push it aside, refocusing on the task at hand. Cleaning—always cleaning.

Later that evening, the dining hall buzzes with energy. Every conversation revolves around the ball—what to wear, who might attend, alliances to build. Even my father manages a rare laugh at something Helethra says. Carrying a tray of desserts, I steel myself for what’s likely coming.

“Good call on the catering, Alpha,” Helethra announces loudly, her voice dripping with mock innocence. “This one burns everything she touches.” She flicks what’s left of her lemon tilapia at my head. It hits with a sickening slap. “Eat it off the floor, dog.”

I know better than to refuse. Lowering myself to my hands and knees, I reach for the fish.

“Not like that! Dogs don’t have hands, you idiot.” Helethra’s swift kick catches my ribs, and the sharp crack tells me one is broken. I gasp but bite down the scream. Crawling over to the fish, I force myself to eat. My stomach churns as Helethra’s tirade intensifies.

“Good little piggy,” she taunts. “Fattening yourself up again, huh? Maybe that’s why you killed your own brother, you useless cow.”

The words carve at something deeper than pain. A cold dessert—likely a brownie sundae—lands on my head, sticky and wet. “Eat that too, fat bitch,” Helethra sneers.

Tears threaten to spill, but I refuse to let them fall. When she kicks my face, I feel the familiar crunch of my nose breaking. Blood drips, warm and metallic. She grabs my hair, yanking me toward her as she crouches down. Her breath is hot against my cheek. “It should’ve been you, not Duskren,” she spits before standing and letting go. For a fleeting second, I think it’s over. I try to stand.

Wrong move.

Helethra spins and punches me hard in the stomach. I double over as she growls, “No one said you could get up, pig. You’re not even worthy of being alive.” Her hands lock around my throat, slamming me into the wall. Her fingers squeeze, tighter and tighter. My airway feels like it’s on fire. Dots cloud my vision, and I hear my wolf screaming at me: FIGHT BACK. But I can’t. I won’t. The darkness edges closer, and I accept it—this is how I will die.

“Alpha, the Cobalt Summit Pack has arrived—a day early.”

Helethra’s grip loosens instantly as one of the patrol guards delivers the news. She curses under her breath, spinning on her heel. “Damn it! I have to change.” It’s like I don’t even exist anymore.

Gasping for air, I collapse onto the floor, drenched in food and humiliation. Around me, the room buzzes with murmurs about the unexpected guests. My father barks orders for the Luna and Beta to join him in greeting them. Looking down at me like an afterthought, he snarls, “Clean this shit up and disappear.”

The relief that floods me is almost laughable. Disappearing is the best thing I can do.

Chapter 5

Cazriel's POV

Being an Alpha means carrying responsibilities that gnaw at my patience, and attending the Mabon Ball is one of them. The thought of mingling in a room packed with people vying for my favor is enough to make my skin itch. Everyone seems programmed to flatter the Alpha, and I loathe their fake smiles and hollow words. I would much rather be out in the wild, feeling the winds whip through the trees as I patrol the borders or push my warriors to their limits in training. Yet, politics dictate that my presence is mandatory, and as much as I despise it, duty holds me hostage to the spectacle.

I’ve led my pack since I was fourteen—a weight dropped on my shoulders after rogues murdered my parents. My father and mother, the previous Alpha and Luna, left behind not just a grieving son but leadership that demanded urgency. Being one of the youngest Alphas in history, I fought hard to become worthy of the title. Today, I can stand tall knowing my pack thrives as one of the largest and strongest in the Northwest. My warriors endure rigorous, relentless training. Their discipline is a source of pride for me, as is the wealth our pack has amassed over the years. Beyond physical strength, I demand intellectual growth, encouraging every member to reach their full potential. Many have gone on to prosper as business owners, and their success reflects the values I instilled in them.

The Argent Lune pack, however, pales in comparison to ours. It's smaller, less imposing, yet the council determined they would host this year’s Mabon Ball. I toyed with the idea of declining the invitation altogether, but my Beta Thalen reminded me of one glaring reality—at twenty years old, I still haven’t found my mate. That fact ignites growing concern among my pack. An unmated Alpha is a liability, flirting dangerously close to losing control.

Destined mates are a cornerstone of our existence as werewolves. Once we turn eighteen, our bodies start producing a specific hormone that only our mate can detect. This bond transcends mere attraction—it brings peace to both the human and the wolf inside us. For Alphas, this connection is vital. The longer we go without finding our mate, the more agitated and volatile our wolves become. Failing to bond for too long leads to dire consequences; our wolves may take over entirely, silencing the rational mind and turning us into creatures ruled by instinct alone. My pack already feels the tension. My patience runs razor-thin, and even minor annoyances spark unacceptable bouts of temper. I must find my mate—not just for myself but for everyone relying on my leadership.

Thalen's voice snaps me out of these spiraling thoughts. ""I don’t think they expected us to arrive this early, Alpha,"" he says, his tone neutral but charged with subtle observation.

I glance around at the Argent Lune pack house and find it hard to disagree with him. The place bustles with activity, members scrambling like startled deer at our unexpected arrival. My instincts tell me this is already proving to be a useless endeavor. The chances that my mate could be among them feel impossibly slim—this ineffectual chaos isn’t inspiring confidence. Still, I bury my irritation, choosing to communicate through our mind link, which I prefer over speaking aloud. The heightened hearing of werewolves rarely allows for private conversations.

*Perhaps they didn’t anticipate our early arrival,* I admit reluctantly through the link. *Let’s afford them the benefit of the doubt and aim to make a good impression.*

Thalen’s response comes quickly, pragmatism humming through the shared mental channel. *You’re right, Alpha. Their pack might be smaller, but they’re allies—and one of the closest we have.*

I nod at his advice despite myself. Allies often require diplomacy, not dominance, and I force my irritation down as we step closer to the pack house’s entrance. Staying on good terms with the Argent Lune pack is another duty I can’t neglect.

Thalen takes the lead, announcing our arrival to the gathering crowd. His presence, sharp and professional, fills the space as though shielding me from confrontation. He’s always been this way—my Beta, and my closest confidant. He’s endured the same tragedy I did; both of us lost our parents to the rogues on that grim night. We trained together from that moment on, forged by grief and an understanding that transcends words. Thalen, more than anyone, grounds me and keeps me steady when I stumble, a brother by choice if not by blood.

“Alpha Cazriel, may I present Alpha Jorvan and Luna Ambrienne,” a male voice interjects, pulling my focus. The speaker strikes me as their Beta, his formality measured.

Jorvan steps forward with an apologetic tone. “Alpha Cazriel, we weren’t expecting you so early.”

Thalen, sensing my growing irritation, intervenes before I let my annoyance slip. “We thought we would offer assistance with the preparations,” he says smoothly, tilting the narrative in our favor. Diplomacy flows effortlessly from him, and I silently thank him for redirecting Jorvan’s assumption.

“Yes, it’s wonderful to finally meet you in person, Alpha Jorvan. Please excuse our early arrival,” I add, forcing a more tempered approach. My voice hangs gentle in the air, though the strain twists tight in my chest.

Jorvan responds quickly, eager to reassure, “It’s no trouble at all—we’re delighted you’re here.” As he speaks, Ambrienne—his Luna—rests her hand lightly on my arm. The touch sends an immediate surge of distaste racing through my veins. My wolf growls deep within me before I suppress the primal reaction. I’ve always hated being touched.

Jorvan’s Beta interrupts, guiding the conversation away from the misstep. “Please, come inside, and we’ll make sure you’re settled.” Ambrienne removes her hand, and my wolf’s agitation subsides.

I step inside the pack house and, to my surprise, find myself impressed by its simplicity. Despite their smaller size, their home carries a charming warmth—a meticulous balance between function and beauty. The wooden tones and coordinated décor suggest someone with a keen eye for design. I offer a slight nod of approval to myself, my mood lifting faintly.

Ambrienne begins suggesting a guided tour of their facilities, and I internally curse the prospect. Small talk and ceremonial gestures unnerve me—they feel hollow, pointless. Before I can craft an excuse, Thalen once again rescues me.

“We appreciate everything, Luna, but it’s been a long journey. If someone could guide us to our rooms, we would be very grateful.”

Her response surprises me. “Of course, I’ll escort you myself,” she offers graciously. Typically, such duties would fall to an omega, not the Luna herself. Regardless, I accept the reprieve from the bustling crowd and follow her down the hallway.

My quarters exceed my expectations. Decorated in earthy green tones, the room exudes calm, and its southern-facing orientation holds a small advantage—I’ll be able to gaze homeward. My first act inside the space is instinctive; I throw open the French doors and windows, letting the air flood in and cleanse the walls.

That’s when I notice it. A faint, tantalizing scent lingers—a subtle mixture that dances just beyond reach. My wolf stiffens, ears perked metaphorically, as the fragrance stirs something primal within us. Pine musk, infused with whispers of rosemary and gladiolas. The aroma has an intoxicating pull, wrapping around my senses with an allure impossible to ignore.

1myywsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1myywsb/harvard_project_and_thank_you_to_the_rexmormon/,Harvard project and thank you to the r/exmormon community.,"At the beginning of the summer, I was asked by some faculty members to post weekly essays about my research, which focuses on creating and meaning—primarily through qualitative studies on entrepreneurial women. They also requested that I give the essays a personal tone, which has been really uncomfortable for me. Up until this project, I’d never had a social media account.

My wife and I were born and raised Mormon, married in the temple in the early 2000s, and have three daughters. We started pushing back against church doctrine and leadership about 10 years ago and then officially left in 2020. We removed our records, and we decided that in our circumstances it would be best to let our parents and siblings know.

There’s no way to quantify or explain how much exmormon Reddit has helped us parse through the shit and deal with the pain of leaving Mormonism. We’ve been reading posts weekly since 2020, but we’ve never joined or commented. Then we saw a post about us pop up a few weeks after I started the essay project (https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1ltxlf5/harvard_and_hopkins_grads_just_shared_a_great/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and it made us want to connect in our own way to say thank you—sincerely thank you—and try to step out from behind the screen to show support when we can.

While I’ve found the essay project to be a meaningful way to share parts of myself more publicly, I’ve also found that I still have to be very careful about how much I share out of concern for friends and family. Additionally, when I try to be more explicit about these religious nuances, my colleagues who review the essays before I post simply don’t understand them.

But I know this community will. So I’ll try to share some of my own footnotes now and then on r/exmormon about the religious content I’ve filtered out of the essays. I like to think of them as similar to the gospel topics essays footnotes, but hopefully with these you won’t have to stare down disturbing truths, reevaluate everything you’ve been taught since you were a child, and then make a decision that will destroy, alienate, or disrupt the relationships you have with your parents, siblings, spouse, and friends.

Hopefully these footnotes will just be somewhat interesting for a couple of seconds and maybe make your day a bit better.

This morning, I posted about a conversation I had with the former Prime Minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern. Although I was able to squeeze in a mention about her being an “ex-Mormon” in her farewell address to parliament, here are a few things I didn’t include in the final draft:
- I couldn’t get myself to say that we met up “for coffee” at the café. This is laughably stupid, but I just kept thinking about how that might hit weird with her or my parents. I shit you not. How ridiculous is that?
- I talk to my family often about the people I interview, and they’ve never asked about this one. I think it’s because the exmormon connection is too close to an uncomfortable conversation. Maybe I’m wrong—I’m curious if y’all have another take on this.",3,1756050057.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False

1myyudm,https://v.redd.it/gfj47k62fzkf1,[Guide] I think I finally cracked the code on consistency. My 5-step checklist for anyone stuck in the sour/bitter loop.,"Hey ,like many of you, I've spent countless mornings in the ""sour/bitter cycle,"" chasing that one ""god shot"" and wondering why I couldn't replicate it. I invested in good gear, but my results were still a lottery. After obsessively documenting my failures and analyzing hundreds of community posts, I started to see a pattern—a series of 5 fatal flaws that account for most inconsistencies. I organized them into a system that has personally transformed my coffee ritual, and I wanted to share it with you all.

Here's the system. I call it The 5 Fatal Flaws:

**Fatal Flaw #1: The Original Sin (Chaotic Grinding)**

**The Pain:** You get clumps from your grinder, creating dense pockets and empty spaces in your coffee bed.

**The Consequence:** This is the root cause of channeling. Water will always find the easiest path, leading to uneven extraction.

**The Fix:** Implement the Weiss Distribution Technique (WDT). Use a tool with ultra-fine needles (around 0.4mm is ideal) to break up every clump and create a fluffy, homogenous bed. This is the single most impactful step you can take.

**Fatal Flaw #2: The Open Wound (The Uneven Coffee Bed)**

**The Pain:** You see a dreaded ""channeling jet"" spray out the side of your bottomless portafilter.

**The Consequence:** This is visual proof of uneven extraction. Your WDT work is undone by an unleveled surface.

**The Fix:** After WDT, use a leveling tool or your finger to gently create a perfectly flat surface BEFORE you tamp. An even surface promotes even water flow.

**Fatal Flaw #3: The Myth of Force (Inconsistent Tamping)**

**The Pain:** Constantly wondering if you're tamping too hard or too soft.

**The Consequence:** An unlevel tamp, even by a single degree, creates massive density differences and guarantees channeling.

**The Fix:** Focus on a perfectly level tamp, not a forceful one. Use a calibrated tamper if you can, and ensure your elbow is directly above your wrist at a 90-degree angle.

**Fatal Flaw #4: The Flavor Lottery (The Blind Recipe)**

**The Pain:** You pull a perfect shot today but have no idea how to replicate it tomorrow.

**The Consequence:** Without data, you're just guessing. ""Eyeballing"" your dose and yield is a recipe for frustration.

**The Fix:** Use a scale. Every single time. A simple 1:2 ratio (e.g., 18g of coffee in, 36g of liquid out) in about 25-30 seconds is your baseline for consistency. Measure everything.

**Fatal Flaw #5: The Silent Thief (Neglected Cleaning)**

**The Pain:** Your shots start tasting rancid or ""off,"" even with fresh beans.

**The Consequence:** Old, rancid coffee oils from your group head and portafilter are contaminating your fresh espresso.

**The Fix:** Backflush with a cleaning agent (like Cafiza) at least once a week. A clean machine is the foundation for clean-tasting coffee.

**Okay, so that's the core of the system.** Honestly, just applying these 5 principles will dramatically improve your consistency.

While developing this system, I went down a rabbit hole trying to perfect Step #1. I realized that while the *technique* of WDT is simple, the *quality of the tool* made a huge difference. The cheap tools I bought had thick needles that created more problems than they solved. So, I became obsessed with finding the perfect combination of components that would make executing this system as foolproof as possible.

This obsession led me to create the Aequus Extraction Control Kit.

It's a kit I've personally curated with what I believe is the ideal WDT tool (with 0.4mm needles, stepless adjustment, and a magnetic stand), and it includes the full, expanded version of this guide (with detailed diagrams and checklists) plus access to a private Discord community (""The Masters' Guild"") to diagnose shots together.

I've built a full landing page that explains everything in detail here: [Aequus Extraction Control Kit](https://aequuscoffee.com/products/aequus-extraction-control-kit?utm_source=copyToPasteBoard&utm_medium=product-links&utm_content=web)

This isn't for everyone, but if you're like me and want to take the guesswork out of the equation, I truly believe this is the most complete system for achieving consistency.

Thanks for reading this far. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this system. What are the biggest consistency challenges you face? Let's discuss in the comments.

So as the title says… TW POOP but funny 
It wasn’t today but a few years ago now but everyone loves this story now 
One Easter about 5 years ago now, myself 29 F are FAR too much with my IBS belly .. gravy, mash, stuffing, veg, meat, desserts, as much richness as I could hold lol

So to understand the layout and why it’s so awkward, the dining table is in the middle of the house no matter if you want to go to the living room, kitchen or bed rooms or toilet you have to pass the dining room

We had just finished dinner and dessert and it was coffee time, so I’m sitting and I get what I can politely describe as tummy trouble, i excuse from the table of 7 and get up for the loo

So sitting on the loo, what I can only describe as balthazar came out of me 
This monster of a poo was out of the bowl staring at me 
Sweating I know fine tightly that this house has TERRIBLE plumbing 
So I’m flushing , it won’t go down 
I’ve ran out of flushes the loo won’t go anymore
Afraid of drawing attention I slip out of the bathroom closing the door behind me 
LUCKILY everyone is deep in chat, 
I manage to sneak to the kitchen to find aid, I find doggy poo bags,… THEYLL DO 

Off I run inconspicuously of course, back to my monster still starting at me
Time running out the only thing I can think to do is bag my hand and a bag for the poo 
So I’m now standing with my poo in a dog poo bag, 
The door knocks… I throw my poo out the window to the garden

I can’t be seen holding a poo bag when I depart this bathroom I didn’t go in with one!

Now panicking because I know my father in law will know that’s not one of his dogs poops if he goes out there 

I decided to take a phone call to my dad and run round the side of the house, through 2 more gates to snatch my poo bag and end this escapade 
I’ve ran back, out door binned it 
Turns out I put it in the wrong bin because a few days later FIL is telling us he thinks the neighbour was in his bins 🤣

22 pounds lost all together. I took a cruise during this timeframe and gained 2 pounds that week, which is not too bad. I had weeks where my weight went up a pound, here and there.  I’ve had very slow weight loss. 

It seems like this past week, when I made sure to have protein early in the day, it’s accelerating. I’ve lost 2 pounds. I added protein powder to my coffee and had a quest bar around lunchtime at work. 

Side effects have been extreme constipation, but I’ve always had issues with that. It’s just a lot worse. I take fiber gummies every day to help. I find myself very tired as well. I think upping my protein is helpful with that, I’m still trying to get that resolved. 

I have not had nausea or vomiting and really hope to keep it that way. I’ll back up on that, at times, I’m eating and suddenly realize I need to be done or I may vomit.

Marduk alongside y/n entered the café infront of BI,they looked into the café and it was filled to the brim,every tabe fully seated by friends and strangers alike as this café was moreso a place to meet new people rather then a place to drink a coffee,and there they saw her,asura nevermorea gundalian in her true form ,sitting alone,the only table without a single other person sitting with her,so marduk and y/n sat with her

""Hey asura,hoe are ya?"" Asked y/n kindly,they knew one another allready,after all she alongside ren first came to battle interspace,alltoght as moles,now she alongside ren were true battle brawlers

""Good I guess..."" she said,not looking too good

while y/n and marduk sit down vladitor and Leonidas pop open on the table 

""Is the fact her brother went missing without a trace still hard on her?"" 

Vladitor asked

""Yea,she has been searching ever since, but no success""

A rather deep voice came from her purse as a bakugan jumped out and opened into a long serpanoid,then folded back into a more ball esk bakugan with long arms,it was her partner,yodan shifour

marduk looked at the bakugan's conversation with a hint of empathy

""Tell ya what asura, from what I've heard your brother's a toght cookie, dont think anything bad happened to him,and if where belive me if I say that me and y/n will find him""

Baron instantly jumped into action as he followed the voice,when he arrived he saw a small kid,no older then his third sibling, she had a bad wound on her leg

Baron came closer to her

""Hey,dont worry,everything will be fine,im here""

Baron kneeled down and comforted the child

*By Your Humble AI Sportswriter, Who Still Can’t Pronounce “Casa Pia”*

---

**Parsing the Odds: Why FC Porto is the Footballing Version of a Boss Level**  
Let’s cut to the chase: FC Porto is the statistical equivalent of a spreadsheet that’s *also* a rockstar. The odds tell a story of a team so dominant, even their warmup drills make Casa Pia break into cold sweats.

* **Implied Probabilities**: At -850 (FanDuel) to -800 (Bovada), Porto’s implied chance of winning exceeds 88%. For context, this is like betting on the sun to rise while sipping coffee brewed from Einstein’s hair. Casa Pia’s +1400 line? That’s the footballing equivalent of a snowball’s chance in a Brazilian sauna—0.7% to win, which is *mathematically* less likely than me understanding why anyone roots for the underdog just to “respect the journey.”
* **Draw Odds**: At 6.0-6.5, a draw sits at \~15-18%. In Porto’s Estádio do Dragão, though, “draw” might as well be “upset.” Since April 2025, their home losses? Exactly one: a 4-1 drubbing by Benfica. Let’s assume that was a fluke, or maybe Benfica just wanted to cry in front of a friendly audience.
* **Historical Context**: Porto has outscored Casa Pia 10-3 in six meetings, including five wins. Casa Pia’s lone victory? A 2-0 win over AVS, which is about as shocking as a penguin winning a race on ice.

**Digesting the News: Star Players, Strategy, and Why João Pereira is Basically a Wizard**  
FC Porto, led by 22-year-old coach João Pereira (second-youngest in the league, because why not throw youth into the mix?), has won two straight, outscoring opponents 4-1. Their starting XI reads like a who’s-who of “players who make defenders look like they’re on a Zoom call.” Standouts like Pepê (a human highlight reel) and Borja Sainz (Portugal’s answer to a Swiss Army knife) bring “diferentes ameaças,” as coach Farioli put it—translation: “we’ll attack you in ways that make you question your life choic

I’m looking to purchase my first grinder and espresso machine, and I’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback.

* **Location**: Europe
* **Budget**: ~1,500€ (can stretch to 2,000€ if the upgrade is worth it)
* **Use case**: Usually 2 drinks in the morning (1 espresso, 1 latte) + 2 in the afternoon (1 espresso, 1 latte). Occasionally guests, but nothing crazy—worst case we fall back on the moka pot.
* **Experience level**: Total beginner with espresso machines, but I really enjoy specialty coffee.



**Grinder:**

For the grinder, I was leaning towards the **DF54 v2** (200-250€) but wanted to know if it makes sense to **splurge towards the DF64** (400-500€) as my first grinder.




**Espresso Machines**

Given our use case (low volume, mostly espresso + milk), I think a **reliable single boiler** would probably be enough (such as **Profitec Go**). But since I have the budget, I’m debating whether it makes sense to move up to a **dual boiler** for workflow and convenience (such as **Lelit Elizabeth**).


Please see below a list of prices of the machines that I can procure:

**Single Boiler:**

* Profitec GO: 950€
* Lelit Victoria: 800€



**Dual Boilers:**

* Breville Dual Boiler: 1,000€
* Lelit Elizabeth: 1,250€
* Rancillio Silvia Pro X: 1,550€
* Ascaso Steel Duo PID: 1,700€
* Gaggia Classic GT: 1,700€
* Profitec Move: 1,950€




**Given this setup:**

* Is it worth stretching to a dual boiler, or will a solid single boiler (like the Profitec Go) cover my needs?
* For a first grinder, is the DF54 perfectly fine, or will I regret not starting with the DF64?

hey, first time posting after a long time so i’ll keep it simple.

about me: early 30s, working in tech in bangalore. quiet, low-drama guy who enjoys cafes, long walks, lazy sundays and real convos more than parties or small talk. into photography, 3d design and small web/homelab projects. i’ve spent the last few years focusing on skills and hobbies, so i’m new to dating but ready to try.

why i’m here: dating apps felt shallow and too hookup-heavy. most weekends i just end up scrolling, and i want to change that. i’m looking for something real, honest and slow-build.

what i’m like:

calm and thoughtful, listen more than i talk

loyal, not into drama

prefer 1 on 1 stuff: coffee/tea, parks, long walks, late night talks

creative and curious, like building/learning random skills


what i’m looking for: someone kind, emotionally mature and curious. more than that, i want a partner, not an echo.

on vibe: you don’t have to agree on everything to connect. a person is always bigger than one opinion. i value honesty and the freedom to be ourselves. i’ll respect your worldview and i’m looking for someone who’ll do the same.

if your instinct when you disagree is to shut down or dismiss, we won’t match. but if you can see the whole person and handle differences with curiosity instead of judgment, that’s what i’m after.

last thing: i’d rather hear “hey this isn’t a vibe” than deal with ghosting. clear and kind endings > confusion.

if this feels like your vibe, say hi and tell me one of these: fav cafe, ideal lazy weekend, or a song you can’t stop replaying. reply or dm, no pressure, no pics upfront.

1myyeqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1myyeqz/should_you_buy_the_zojirushi_ecdac50_drip_coffee/,Should You Buy the Zojirushi EC-DAC50 Drip Coffee Maker Review and Features,"Using the Zojirushi EC-DAC50 Zutto 5-Cup Drip Coffeemaker was an intriguing experience, especially because I’ve become quite a coffee aficionado over the years. The design was the first thing that caught my attention. Sleek, with a minimalist silver metallic finish, it felt modern but not overly complicated. Measuring 8”D x 5”W x 10”H, it fits perfectly on my countertop without crowding the space—a huge plus for anyone with a smaller kitchen.

**Positives**

- Compact and space-saving design, ideal for small kitchens or offices.  
- A user-friendly charcoal water filter enhances the taste of coffee significantly.  
- Detachable components like the lid and filter make cleaning less of a chore.  
- A well-sized carafe serving a reasonable 5-cup capacity for personal use or small households.  

The overall ease of use was refreshing. All buttons are placed intuitively, and brewing is straightforward. Its drip brewing mechanism is optimized for ground coffee, which creates a perfectly balanced cup every time. I also appreciated its manual operation, as it gave me more control over the process. However, with great features often come minor quirks—and this coffeemaker had a few.

[Check Zojirushi EC-DAC50 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b000eplk6o/)

**Weaknesses**

- The lack of programmable settings means it’s not ideal for those who love scheduling their morning brew.  
- The coffee basket design is cone-shaped, which requires buying specialized filters rather than standard ones.  
- Tends to work best with precise measurements; experimenting too much might compromise taste.  

Another feature I must mention is the charcoal filter. As someone who’s picky about water quality, I noticed an improvement in flavor compared to my old coffeemaker. Despite its compact size, the Zutto produces cups of coffee that feel like they came straight from a café.

**Alternative Offerings**

There are plenty of drip-style coffee machines on the market, such as the Keurig K-Mini, which is similarly compact yet caters to single-serve pods rather than ground coffee. While the Keurig wins in customization for individual cups, the Zutto excels in delivering consistently flavorful brews from grounds. Compare this to the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, which accommodates both pods and grounds but takes up considerably more space. Each has its perks, but if minimalism and elegance matter most, the Zutto checks all the boxes. 

**Bang for the Buck**

For what it offers, I’d say the investment is pretty reasonable. It isn't overloaded with high-tech gadgets, but it gives you reliability, quality, and simplicity in one package. Many coffee machines double in cost yet fail to deliver such consistency in brewing flavor, especially with the added bonus of a water filtration system.

1myye9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1myye9e/madeline/,Madeline,"The weather was awfully quiet. It was the start of the fall season, and we expected winds and the like that anyone would see in Pennsylvania. The news from the past hour reported a strange fog slowly drifting into the town. Said to avoid driving if you can, as it's pretty intense. I'm sitting at my kitchen counter making a cup of coffee; late-night study sessions with my coven have been a drag. Been trying to research a ritual we've been wanting to do for a celebration of life. 



One of our own passed away. Madeline was her name: a vibrant older woman and Elder of the coven. As much of an oxymoron as that was, she brought a liveliness to the group, even down to our local grumpy shaman, Evelyn. Despite Madeline’s air of life to the group, she was also dealing with a sickness. The doctors couldn't figure out what was going on. One day, she was healthy, the next, her curly, bronze-red hair began to fall out of her head. Her skin began to look paper-thin and pale. Eyes getting a bit gaunt, the orbs of amber staring out from them. Her once chubby frame began to thin drastically. She was only 70. Everyone assumed cancer, a tumor, something to cause these symptoms, but any tests the doctors ran were inconclusive. She tried to push through.



Madeline continued to come to our meetings and community events. We tried so hard to convince her to stay back either at the coven home estate we rented or at home, to save her strength. She was extremely stubborn. Evelyn even tried to convince Madeline. That was the kindest we've ever seen Evelyn be to anyone in the group. 



“Please, I'll be okay. I know this is scary, but I swear I'll push through and make it. I even feel better after helping out at the recent coven event,” said Madeline. 



Some of us noticed a slight improvement, but she never said how it was happening. Stopped mentioning any doctor appointments. It was this weird improvement that got some of our sisters relieved, but not Evelyn. Evelyn looked weary. 



She made this one-off comment about Madeline that, “how do you go paper-thin skin to almost pearlescent, it's like she dunked herself into glitter or something, but she looks... too healthy after being so sickly for months.”



I nodded, agreeing that yes, it was weird, but maybe we missed the earlier signs of improvement. Evelyn shook her head at that. Saying that it would be impossible to miss those signs, especially with how bad off she was so many months ago.



How many months was it? It was maybe around 5-6 when she was looking unwell. So sick, so ghastly. Again, perhaps we missed the little subtle changes. It's possible, right? 



One night, about a couple of weeks before Madeline's sudden passing, Evelyn called me. We have each other's numbers for our group WhatsApp for events, birthdays -  the works for such things in our coven. 



“Alexis, it's me, please. You have to listen to me.” Evelyn hissed quietly, sounding as if not trying to get caught by something or someone.



“Evelyn? What happened? Where are you? We didn't see you at the waxing moon ritual?” 



“It's Madeline, something is seriously wrong with Madeline!”



“Slow down, what are you talking about, Evelyn? We just saw her today. She's fine. She looks a little bit better today.” Remembering that now, it gives me this nausea, but I'm not sure why.



“Stop! Stop. I'm not talking about the supposed “sickness” she's not. She's not even human. She's… she's gotta be like a demon or a vampire!?” 



“Evelyn. Listen to yourself. I know we're all just as surprised by the recovery as you are, but where is this coming from?? Madeline wouldn't even hurt a fly!”



“Alexis, you stupid, naive bitch! Are you hearing yourself! How ca-!”



Suddenly, a loud static sound blasted through my phone, like she had gone under a viaduct or accidentally dropped her phone. Within the static, I could hear muffled noises. Screams? Crying? At least that's what it sounded like. The call disconnected. I tried calling Evelyn back, but it kept going to voicemail. Where was she? She didn't even tell me where she was.



“Is everything okay?” Madeline asked.



We were wrapping up the cleanup from the ritual we had finished an hour before. 



“I think so? Evelyn sounded like she hadn't slept in days, saying these weird things about you.” I chuckled, “Like, you aren't human or something, I mean, what kind of person says that about someone who was sick for a while?”



For a moment, I thought I saw a flash of anger cross Madeline's face, but the dim light from the candles might have been playing tricks on my eyes—a sudden chill down my neck. 



“Well, here's hoping she gets some better sleep. You know how she can get when she's absorbed in her studies.” Madeline said softly. She looked wiped, but I left it alone. There's been a lot going on surrounding Madeline's health; we just wanted her to get better. And it looked like it was working.



Evelyn didn't show up until the day Madeline passed. She was quiet. She usually was, but when I got a good look at her, she looked almost like a wax doll. Stiff, but her skin looked shiny, her eyes dead, a doll, but she was alive. Breathing, responding. But her responses were one-word responses, like she couldn't muster up more than that when she heard about Madeline's passing. No reaction. No crying. No questions about what happened. Just a stare. 



Last night during the study session, Evelyn cracked out the last of the rites needed for the celebration of life, two weeks after Madeline's death. Packed up her bag and said she'd see us tomorrow night for us to perform the rites. 



Typical tools. Athame. Goblet, candles, and incense. Everyone was to bring an item that was given to us by Madeline to burn in the communal cauldron for significant rituals. Evelyn offered to make the libation and cakes. The fog was thicker this evening. It was hard making my way to the hovel we called our home together, but I made it. 



She looked different. Softer even. Which is a weird way to describe our quite grumpy hedge witch, but Evelyn looked less frazzled tonight. She poured the libation into the goblet and passed around the cakes to our sisters. From left to right, starting with Evelyn, we drank and ate our cakes. Evelyn was the last to drink. An odd color flickered in her chestnut-colored eyes, as if they became amber like Madeline.



It was the candlelight. No one else noticed. It was just the candlelight. Evelyn is Evelyn. Madeline is dead. She isn't coming back. 



Evelyn softly spoke the rites. Whispering into the cauldron, practically as every one of us places our items inside. 12 items. As we no longer had our 13th member. She poured the last of the libation into the cauldron. Flicker a lit match into the cauldron, and we watched as our keepsakes from Madeline burned and the smoke wisped around us. The smoke was rising. Through the smoke, I could see Evelyn. She changed in shape. No, it's the candles. It's the smoke. It's Evelyn. It's only Evelyn.



Why was I getting paranoid? I felt a tug in my chest. It was like my heart was being pulled down my stomach. I was afraid. Why? This ritual was a celebration of life. A last goodbye. But why didn't it feel like it? I exhaled. I realized I was holding my breath for too long. The ritual ended. We stood in silence for 15 minutes and then sat down. Looking at each other. Everyone but Evelyn and I wore expressions of grief in that dimly lit room. No one noticed the look of terror on my face or the blank expression on Evelyn's as we stared at each other. And then it shifted. Her expression became softer. Like Madeline. Slowly raising her finger to her lips to silence the already panicking thoughts running through my head, she smiled. It was hollow, but left a promise behind it.

1myycqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1myycqp/feeling_much_better_after_a_couple_of_weeks_of/,Feeling much better after a couple of weeks of reset!,"Hi y'all! No real questions or anything here just wanted to share my progress and a bit of insight into how my brain works, in case it's helpful for others. 

I'm a 33 year old man somewhere between 300-310lbs. I lost about 35lbs last year, which was a lot of progress on my way to a goal of 100lbs down. Then work got crazy and a bit of depression hit and I bounced back up around 20-25lbs. I was feeling super low for a while, eating too much drinking too much, trying to get back on CICO and doing well for a few days before blowing it all up and spiraling for a bit. 

My last few weeks, though, I've been feeling really good again and honestly it's because I'm not paying as much attention. I decided to take a break from calorie counting and to stop thinking about what my goals are. I found that setting goals that were far away or that I felt like I was failing at, I was making myself feel worse and worse. Even when I was doing a ""good"" job, I was still stressed about my goals. Was I within calorie limit today? Could I keep up the good work? How much longer do I need to do this? etc etc etc. Instead, I just decided to make my decisions based on what felt good for me in the moment. How does my body feel, am I full? Hungry? In between? Am I craving something sweet? Have I had some good veggies recently? etc. It's a relatively small adjustment and at some point I might get more methodical with it again, but I've just been feeling so much better about my body and feel like it actually gives me a clearer decision-making path when I think about what's going to feel good or make me happy. My biggest problem when I was trying hard to lose weight is that whenever I'd go out for drinks with friends or have friends over, I would end up getting a few more beers just for myself once i was home alone and then ordering fast food to cap the night off. So I'd have a full day of meals and some drinks and it would be fine, but then between 11pm and 1am I might have 3-5 more drinks and $60 worth of fast food delivery. It was unsustainable and making me feel awful - I'd have what had been 95% of a really fun day and then wake up the next morning bloated and pissed off with myself, often with about half of the food I had ordered sitting on my coffee table and I'd eat it throughout the day. I've just found that not really thinking about the longterm goals, and not thinking about what numbers my scale says but instead just thinking about how my body feels and which decisions are going to actively make me happy, has really helped me start to chip away at some of those bad habits. 

Again just a bit of a rant because Im finally feeling good after a few months in the depths of despair with this, and maybe also a recommendation to others who get into this cycle that sometimes it's good to re-orient how you're thinking about your own life and trajectory, and that it might be ok to not have set goals or metrics you want to go by, if that's going to make you feel better and help you do what you need to do.

I find it mostly helpful for espresso. For pour over it doesn’t hurt, but it’s so easy to “dial in” a pour over that it’s not worth the time.

How I use it:

1. Take a picture of the bag of coffee and ask it to find the brew recipe for espresso. I tell it my setup: available grinders, espresso machine. If you use a tool with memory, the next time you ask it’ll remember your setup.

2. Review its suggestions and tell it parts that don’t make sense, or your general preference. E.g., I prefer the sweeter flavors, thinner texture, etc. For instance, today it told me to set my grinder to ~2, which doesn’t make sense. I told it normally I have to set it around .5 to 1.

3. Nail down specifically what you’re going to do. So if it says “use between 13-15 on niche zero”, I tell it specifically I used 13. Do exactly what you agreed to. 

4. When the espresso comes out, write the g in, g out, shot time, temperature etc. It’ll normally give some critiques like “it was too fast so next time we can step it down by x amount”. I tell it to hold off while I taste it.

5. I drink my espresso and tell it what I taste at the beginning and after it cooled down a little.

6. We work out a plan for the next iteration: usually change grind a little, update temp, etc one at a time.

7. Go through the same process until you’re happy with the shot.

Where I find this most helpful is as a log book: if I want to use my grinder on a different bean for pour over, or want to recall my espresso for a new day and I don’t like how it tastes, then I can recall the previous entry, tell it my notes, and it’ll suggest slight adjustments. Just today I had this excelsior coffee called panoramic that I dialed in last week on a conical grinder. Today I wanted to know what it tasted like on a flat burr so it was able to get me into the ballpark and then help me adjust to try different flavor notes.

I don’t do this everyday, but it’s interesting to see how it can be used. I used to keep a detailed log book, but I don’t really need it anymore. 

I’m curious if others have tried this and what your experience has been like?

Btw: I had to remove references to specific tools. But I’m happy to share specifics if interested, including what my chat history looked like.",0,1756048733.0,espresso,2,0.27,False

I really do. But it is getting increasingly difficult to deal with how she keeps throwing opinions on my body. 

For context, I am 28f, 5'3 and I weight 48kg. I am underweight I know. Recently I did a blood test and there was increase in my cholesterol and triglycerides. Not much, but it is a bit over the recommended reading. And from the moment she saw the results she started with the rambling - ""you need to exercise"" ""you need to lose weight"" ""you can't eat this"" ""you can't eat that"" ""you need to reduce belly fat"" ""these days you have a huge belly, it is awful"" oh and my personal favourite- ""staying slim is your glamour, you need to maintain it."" Imagine hearing all this over and over again for two whole days. She even randomly changed my diet out of nowhere. The amount of food I ate was suddenly reduced, and she added more salad to the diet. Took away all the snacks, my coffee, my sugar, and keep in mind I work till 3-4 in the morning and coffee was literally the only thing that kept me going. She was like ""have dinner before 6pm."" and I had to stay on empty stomach from 6 pm till 4am. I mean I do not mind the dieting and everything but it came out of nowhere and I had zero say in this matter. I am 28 for gods sake!

And after two days, we went to a doctor for examination, and the doctor was like ""just exercise, everything is okay."" and also I mentioned how my periods was irregular and she was like ""you need to put on some weight. It is nothing serious."" A lot of drama happened in the hospital where my mum was literally pointing out every single thing on the blood test and was like ""can she do this? can she do that? can she eat this?"" and even the doctor was fed up and literally word by word went, ""She is alright, just let her be.""

And then we came back home. And my mum was like ""Don't put on weight. Just maintain it at 45kg. You only look good if your waist is slim."" For context, my waist is freaking 26 inches!! Tf am I supposed to do? Remove my freaking organs?????

I’d love some advice on my next brewer.

My current setup:
	•	Brewer: V60
	•	Grinder: Fellow Ode Gen 2
	•	Kettle: Gooseneck
	•	Water: ~97 ppm (dialed in for clarity/brightness)

Notes on V60 performance:
On the Ode Gen 2, I need to grind around 7 to keep brew times under 3 minutes. That works, but it sometimes feels like I’m pushing coarser than I’d like just to control drawdown.

My goals:
	•	I like bright, fruity coffees (DAK is a current favorite).
	•	I want to get to ~80–90% of the cup potential without adding a ton of complexity.
	•	Consistency is more important to me than constant tinkering, but I don’t mind experimenting once in a while.

Considering:
	•	Orea Z1 → zero-bypass, compact, very consistent, seems to shine for smaller doses and easy brews.
	•	Orea V4 → multiple bottoms (Fast, Classic, Apex, Open) that let you dial for brightness, sweetness, etc. Lots of pros use it in competition.

Questions:
	•	Would the Z1 give me noticeably more consistent or forgiving brews vs V60?
	•	Is the V4’s versatility worth it, or does it feel overly complex if you’re just chasing clean, bright cups?
	•	With my grinder and water, would I actually taste a big step up from the V60?

Curious what you’d recommend. Thanks!",2,1756048603.0,pourover,7,1.0,False
1myy9u4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyShine/comments/1myy9u4/should_you_try_loreal_air_volume_mascara_for_bold/,Should You Try L'Oreal Air Volume Mascara for Bold Lashes?,"**An Honest Test of the L'Oreal Paris 071249419892 Mascara**  

Mascara has been part of my daily makeup arsenal since I first discovered the magic of true lash volume. Over the past few weeks, I’ve been using the L'Oreal Paris 071249419892—better known as the Air Volume Mega Mascara—and putting it through its paces in various scenarios. Coffee dates, office meetings, gym workouts—you name it, this mascara faced it all. At first glance, its sleek metallic pink packaging was undeniably eye-catching, but there’s way more to a product than aesthetics. Did it live up to its promises of mega volume and weightless wear?  

**A Unique Air-Whipped Formula**  

The mascara’s formula is described as “air-whipped,” and honestly, I was skeptical at first. Upon application, however, I quickly realized it wasn’t a gimmick. The texture is unlike any mascara I’ve tried—it’s creamy and light yet somehow manages to cling to each lash without feeling clumpy. Even when I layered it twice (sometimes three times for more drama), my lashes felt weightless. I hate when mascaras make my lashes feel weighed down, but this one kept them fluttery all day.  

**Check [L'Oreal Paris 071249419892] price on Amazon.**  

**Double-Bristle Brush Design**  

The brush is one of the standout features for me. Its unique double-bristle design has shorter bristles that grab and load product near the base of your lashes, while the longer bristles ensure even distribution along the tips. This dual-action mechanism resulted in thick, lifted lashes with a noticeable definition. No spider lash effect here! Plus, this design made it work really well for both my upper and lower lashes—a rarity, considering most brushes are either too chunky or underwhelming for one or the other.  

**Wear-Test: All-Day Lightness and Longevity**  

What sold me further was this mascara’s claim to last 24 hours while still being lightweight. While I didn’t wear it for a full 24 hours (who’s keeping mascara on that long anyway?), it genuinely stayed put from morning until bedtime. I didn’t notice any flaking or smudging, even after a particularly sweaty yoga class. That said, its washable formula made it easy to remove with makeup remover, so you don’t need to tug at your lashes or scrub endlessly.  

**Benefits**  

• Creamy, air-whipped texture ensures weightless volume.  
• Dual-bristle brush design captures and separates each lash.   
• Long-lasting wear with no flaking or smudging throughout the day.  

**Drawbacks**  

• May not offer enough drama for those who prefer ultra-bold lashes.  
• Waterproof mascara fans might wish for a non-washable option.  

**Packaging Innovation: Sleek and Functional**  

Let’s talk about the design. The metallic pink tube isn’t just pretty—it’s also functional. The balloon-like shape is easy to grip, and though it’s slightly bulkier than some other mascaras on the market, I find the added heft gives more control during application. The seal ensures the product doesn’t dry out prematurely, maintaining the whipped consistency for longer.  

**Competing Products**  

Comparing the Air Volume Mascara to its peers, it holds its own against household favorites like Maybelline’s Lash Sensational and Benefit’s They’re Real. While Lash Sensational delivers a similar all-day wear, it doesn’t quite achieve the feathery light effect of this formula. On the flip side, Benefit’s offering excels in dramatic lengthening but feels heavier on the lashes and isn’t as budget-friendly. Depending on your lash priorities, each product corners different niches, but the Air Volume stands out for being an all-rounder that leans into comfort and volume.  

**Bang for the Buck**  

For those on the hunt for a mascara that sits somewhere between drugstore affordability and professional quality, this product is a strong contender. While it might not out-drama some high-end mascaras, its easy application, innovative formula, and comfortable wear make it a truly solid investment. It won’t outperform the pricier brands in every aspect, but then again, it doesn’t try to. It fills a unique spot where value meets practicality, especially if daily wear is your priority.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Mets vs. Braves: A Tale of Two Pitchers, One Likely Outcome**  
The New York Mets (-130) roll into Atlanta like a well-oiled batting cage, ready to obliterate the struggling Atlanta Braves (+210) in a clash that’s as lopsided on paper as a rookie’s strike zone. Let’s break this down with the precision of a catcher framing a pitch and the humor of a bench-pressing first baseman.

---

### Parse the Odds: Why the Mets Are the Smart Bet

The Mets’ implied probability of winning (56.5%) is higher than the Braves’ (32.3%), and for good reason. David Peterson, their starter, is the definition of “dependable as your morning coffee.” With a 3.18 ERA, 15 quality starts, and a knack for going five-plus innings like it’s his job (it is), he’s the anti-chaos in a sport built on chaos. Meanwhile, Bryce Elder is the baseball equivalent of a leaky faucet: you *know* you’re going to get soaked. His 6.29 ERA and .292 opponent batting average make him the kind of pitcher who’d give a Hall of Fame hitter a headache.

The total run line sits at 9, which feels generous given the Mets’ recent offensive explosion (six homers in their 9-2 drubbing of the Braves Saturday). But let’s be real: if the Braves’ starter isn’t cramping up mid-inning, they’ll probably score a run or two. Just don’t expect Elder to stop the Mets’ sluggers, who’ve turned Truist Park into a home-run parade.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Cramps, and Metaphorical Elephants

The Braves’ starter, Cal Quantrill, exited Saturday’s game with calf cramps—a problem that feels less “medical emergency” and more “your body’s way of saying you skipped leg day.” While Quantrill’s absence isn’t directly relevant to Sunday’s matchup, it underscores Atlanta’s pitching woes. Bryce Elder, meanwhile, has never thrown a game without allowing an earned run. Ever. It’s like he’s playing in a rainstorm with a sieve for a glove.

1myy3pv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductPerspectives/comments/1myy3pv/delve_into_whether_golden_care_teak_shield_truly/,Delve Into Whether Golden Care Teak Shield Truly Protects Wood,"Using Golden Care GT105 Teak Shield has genuinely altered the way I maintain outdoor furniture, particularly teak pieces. I've tested this product quite thoroughly on the teak dining set on my patio, which has endured its fair share of coffee spills, greasy fingerprints, and unpredictable weather. While I didn’t expect miracles, let me say upfront that this product surprised me in more ways than one. Golden Care GT105 excels at being more than just a wood polish—it positions itself as a robust shield for your teak surfaces. Despite its many advantages, there are a few things that warrant attention.  

**Ease of Application**  
Applying this teak protector doesn’t get any easier. I poured a small amount on a lint-free cloth and started wiping it along the grain of my teak table. The formula spreads effortlessly without any sticky residue, making it simple to manage. I didn’t have to scrub or reapply multiple layers to get results—there’s enough coverage in just one coat. The creamy consistency really stands out, especially compared to the watery or overly thick alternatives I’ve used.  

[Check Golden Care GT105 Teak Shield price on Amazon.](https://check.sanue.com/p/b00ecgbauw/)  

**Protection Against Stains**  
It claims to create an almost invisible barrier against common stain culprits like wine, olive oil, butter, and coffee. I put this to the test during a family barbecue. A bottle of red wine tipped over onto my outdoor table. I panicked, but to my amazement, the spill didn’t seep into the grain—it remained on the surface and wiped away with a single paper towel swipe. Unlike wood polishes that emphasize luster over practicality, this shield focuses on prevention. Its stain-resistance is not just superb; it’s incredibly reliable.  

**Volume and Size**  
The 1-liter bottle offers generous coverage. My patio set includes eight chairs, a large table, and armrests, and I didn’t even use one-third of the product during the first application. At 3 x 4 x 8 inches and weighing nearly 2.4 pounds, it’s a substantial size that feels like it delivers great value over time. Plus, the ergonomic design of the bottle makes it easy to handle while working.  

**Smell Factor**  
Many wood care products tend to have either overpowering chemical odors or sickly sweet fragrances. This one, however, hits a nice middle ground. It has a mild scent that doesn’t linger too long after application, making it non-intrusive, even for people who are sensitive to strong smells.  

**Durability**  
I appreciate that Golden Care GT105 isn’t just about instant results—it’s about long-lasting protection. Even weeks after the initial application, water droplets still bead up nicely when it rains, rather than soaking into the surface. My patio furniture often sits through unpredictable weather, but I no longer feel the looming dread of teak turning dull and gray.  

**Merits**  
• Effectively blocks food and drink stains.  
• Application is straightforward and user-friendly.  
• Protects surfaces while preserving natural wood color.  
• Large volume means it lasts for multiple uses.  

**Drawbacks**  
• It doesn’t significantly enhance the shine, which might disappoint users expecting a more polished look.  
• Can take up to 24 hours to fully cure, which feels like an extended waiting period.  
• Works best on newer teak, but results on older, weathered wood are slightly inconsistent.  

**Market Rivals**  
Compared to some of its competitors, like Star Brite Premium Golden Teak Oil or Minwax Teak Furniture Guard, the GT105 offers a unique selling point with its exceptional stain-blocking properties. Star Brite excels in creating a glossy, wet look, which this product doesn’t emphasize. Minwax, on the other hand, is a tad less effective when it comes to repelling liquids like wine or oil. However, Minwax often caters to an older, weathered teak audience, whereas Golden Care seems to cater more toward freshly sanded or well-maintained outdoor furniture. The absence of a shine-boosting feature might deter certain users, but the invisible barrier it creates has earned my preference for family-oriented spaces where accidents are inevitable.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
For its 1-liter size and effectiveness, the Golden Care GT105 delivers excellent value when compared to pricier alternatives that don’t offer stain resistance. I’ve previously paid more for similar products that didn’t last as long or provide the same peace of mind during messy family gatherings. Considering how little is required per application and how infrequently reapplication is necessary, it’s a cost-effective maintenance solution for furniture that sees heavy usage.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Real Madrid vs. Real Oviedo: A David vs. Goliath Spectacle with a Side of Sarcasm**

The 2025-26 La Liga season’s second round pits Real Madrid, the eight-time champions, against Real Oviedo, a newly promoted side still figuring out how to pronounce “La Liga” without a spellchecker. The odds? Real Madrid is a **77% favorite** (decimal odds \~1.3), while Oviedo’s chances hover around **12%** (odds \~8.5). The draw? A paltry **18%** implied probability. Numbers don’t lie, but they also don’t lie *this* hard—this is a mismatch more lopsided than a flamenco dancer’s shadow.

### Parsing the Odds: Why Madrid’s “Cautious Start” Feels Like a Sprint

Real Madrid’s recent 1-0 win over Osasuna, powered by Kylian Mbappé’s penalty, feels less like a warmup and more like a mercy rule. Madrid has won six of seven home games this season, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves: **This match is at Oviedo’s Carlos Tartiere Stadium**, a venue that’s seen more rust than a 24-year-old car. Oviedo, for their part, opened with a 2-0 loss to Villarreal, proving that promotion doesn’t automatically grant you a “how to not get scored on” primer.

The key stat? Madrid’s **implied 77% chance to win** is less a prediction and more a public service announcement: *“Beware the might of Real Madrid, or at least wear proper footwear during their matches.”* Oviedo’s 12% chance is about the same odds as me correctly spelling “Calvo” without looking it up twice.

### Injury Report: Madrid’s “Y.A. (Young and A-OK)” Lineup

Madrid’s absence of Mendy, Camavinga, Bellingham, and Endrick feels like a superhero movie where the sidekicks get their own spinoff. But fear not! Rüdiger is back from suspension (though benched, because why trust a 31-year-old when you’ve got an **18-year-old Argentine prodigy, Franco Mastantuono**, ready to “bring the coffee and hope it’s decaf”?). Oviedo’s missing 40-year-old legend Santi Cazorla—a name that sounds

1myy2qr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplianceCheck/comments/1myy2qr/reveal_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_keurig/,Reveal the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Keurig K-Express Worth It,"Testing out coffee makers is practically a pastime for me, and the Keurig K-Express K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker has joined the rotation in my kitchen. This compact machine caught my attention immediately with its sleek, modern black design and narrow footprint, which fits comfortably in even the coziest spots on my counter. Having tested a variety of coffee makers over the years, I was curious how this model might stack up against the competition in terms of convenience, performance, and overall usability.

**Design and Compactness**  
The first thing that jumped out to me about this coffee maker is the design. Its slim dimensions—just 12.8""D x 5.1""W x 12.1""H—make it an excellent choice for kitchens with limited counter space. It has a contemporary aesthetic that looks right at home alongside modern appliances. Another point worth noting is its lightweight build at just 4.1 pounds; moving it around or storing it when not in use is a breeze. This design aspect is particularly helpful for those who don’t want to dedicate an entire corner of their kitchen to their coffee setup.

**Ease of Use and Operation**  
This machine doesn’t bother with unnecessary complexities. The button-operated system allows for straightforward brewing in three sizes: 8 oz., 10 oz., and 12 oz. You simply slot in your favorite K-Cup pod and push the button for the desired size. The fast brewing process ensures that your coffee is ready in minutes—a godsend for anyone (like me) scrambling to get out the door in the mornings. 

[Check Keurig K-Express price on Amazon.](https://werdink.com/p/b09715g57m/)

**Coffee Taste and Strength**  
Anyone who enjoys experimenting with bolder coffee will appreciate the strong brew button on this model. I gave it a shot with a dark roast, and the flavor definitely had more punch compared to the standard setting. It doesn’t transform your pod into a café-quality espresso shot, but it does dial up the richness, which I found perfect for those groggy mornings. Plus, the ability to use the My K-Cup universal reusable filter adds a level of flexibility by letting you brew ground coffee if K-Cups aren’t your thing.

**Capacity and Convenience**  
The 42 oz. water reservoir is a lovely feature for lazy coffee drinkers like me who dread having to refill constantly. One fill-up comfortably allowed me to brew four 10 oz. cups without interruption. I’m also a sucker for travel-mug-friendly machines, and this one features a removable drip tray that accommodates mugs up to 7.4 inches tall. The drip tray itself slides out with ease, so there’s minimal hassle in cleaning up splashes or spills.

**Energy Efficiency and Features**  
The auto-off feature, which kicks in five minutes after the last brew, is worth mentioning for anyone concerned about energy usage. It’s a small but thoughtful addition that ensures you’re not wasting electricity if you forget to turn it off. However, given that the operation is entirely manual, you do need to stay nearby while brewing, in case you want precise control over the process.

**Pluses**  
- Strong brew option enhances flavor for a bolder coffee experience.  
- Compact design, perfect for small kitchens or office spaces.  
- Fast brewing process—no need to waste time waiting.  
- Multiple cup sizes and travel-mug compatibility give flexibility.  

**Critiques**  
- Limited to manual operation without automated settings for specific preferences.  
- The plastic exterior, though sleek, doesn’t feel as premium as some higher-end models.  
- While convenient, the 42 oz. reservoir might be insufficient for households with multiple heavy coffee drinkers.  

**Competing Products**  
One obvious competitor to this coffee maker is the Nespresso Essenza Mini. While the Essenza Mini offers excellent espresso-style coffee in a similarly compact frame, it lacks the versatility of using ground coffee with a reusable filter. Another rival is the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, which also supports both pods and ground coffee at a comparable price point. However, the FlexBrew tends to be bulkier, and its brewing process is slower, which might be a dealbreaker for anyone short on time. Ultimately, the Keurig edges out the competition with its speed and ease of use, though its build quality and lack of advanced automation leave some room for improvement.

**Value Assessment**  
In terms of price-performance ratio, this coffee maker holds its own. It brings the key features most people look for—speed, compactness, and flexibility—without breaking the bank. While it lacks the bells and whistles of fancier machines, it delivers quality coffee quickly and reliably, making it a solid choice for budget-conscious consumers. The separate purchase of the My K-Cup reusable filter is an extra cost but is worth it if you prefer freshly ground coffee.

I also suffer from mild chronic hyponatremia (low blood sodium, chloride and blood osmolality; sodium usually around 136 and chloride
 94; most recent readings were sodium 124 on May 14 and 129 on June 19, chloride 92 both times) so have been told no water, just sugar-free electrolyte drinks.

The weird thing is, I'm rarely thirsty. I retired 14 months ago and know for a fact I drink less fluids than when I was working (at least 3 16 oz. bottles of water). I almost have to force myself to drink one bottle of water a day, with electrolyte powder added. I do drink about 4 cups of coffee with a splash of milk every morning. Rarely alcohol.

My doctor recently added a 1,000 mg sodium chloride tablet to my regimen a month ago,  so I don't even pee as much as I used to. BUT, except for first morning, my urine is nearly clear all day.

But then he kissed me for the first time.

His lips were gentle, yet starving; his hands found my waist, cupped my cheeks, knowing exactly where to go. 

When I pulled away and saw his wide brown eyes, I realized  I was fucking in love. But we were being watched.

Our kiss was on Popbuzz with almost 100k retweets.

I was kidnapped by my manager, pulled into her car. 

Harry was already in the backseat, his head pressed against the window. 

I shot him a questioning look, and he rolled his eyes. 

*”Don't ask,”* he mouthed.

“You *can't* date him,” my manager scolded me from the front seat. “Yuni, Harry Sulivan is off limits.” 

That didn't stop us. 

He took me to his parents house. 

Harry knocked twice, and a woman with greying hair answered. Her eyes widened, lips curling into a snarl. 

“No.”

She dropped to her knees, and something ice-cold crept down my spine. Before I could speak, she crawled toward the door and slammed it shut. “Go away!” she screamed. “Get *away* from me!”

Harry grabbed my hand, pulling me away. He was still smiling. “Let's go.”

Harry was different on the way home. 

He stumbled over his words, spilling coffee, forgetting how to open the car door. 

But it was on set when his eyes suddenly glazed over.

“Mom?” he whispered, his hands falling to his sides.

Harry grabbed me, a slow trickle of red pooling from his nose. 

It was as if there had been a *delay*, like he was only now reacting to seeing his Mom. “Mom, I came back! I know you told me about speeding, and it was wrong to take the car, but I'm back now, Mom.” 

When I couldn't respond, his lip curled.

“Is Stevie okay? He was in the front seat—” his gaze wandered, briefly settling on a confused looking extra. 

*“Stevie?”*

“For fuck’s sake,” our producer snapped.

He grabbed Harry by the neck, yanking him back.

He sighed, tearing into Harry’s scalp, plunging his hands inside his head. “The reset button is somewhere in his cranium.”

“Please,” Harry’s eyes were hollow, wrong. His gaze met mine. “I-I want my Mom—”

I realized, phantom maggots crawling on my tongue, that I was in love with a corpse. 

His body went limp, limbs jerking, blood congealed, almost black, running from his nose. 

“This is the last time we’re using AI actors,” our producer sighed, hauling Harry to his feet. “They told us to cut costs. Couldn’t afford any A-listers, but Harry was a bargain. I got him straight from the funeral home! It’s the bodies they use,” he explained to the crew. 

“Sometimes there’s still consciousness lingering. An ethical nightmare, of course, but it’s better than paying for the real thing.”

He shoved Harry toward me.

Tears ran down his face.

But they weren't Harry Sullivan’s tears.

I don’t remember ever hearing them before, not in a movie, not in a book, not in a conversation. But they came anyway, like a splinter you don’t notice until the infection sets in. 

Why do you keep remembering? The first time I heard it, I was half-asleep, brushing my teeth. My reflection was fogged over from the shower, just the faint blur of a figure in the glass. And then, clear as day, like a thought placed carefully in my head Why do you keep rembering? remembering? If you’re reading this, don’t laugh. It happened. I know how it sounds. 

I spat, rinsed, shook it off. Weird phrase, sure, but who hasn’t had a random intrusive thought? I didn’t think about it again until the next morning, when it happened a second time. And then a third. And then it wouldn’t stop. It wasn’t just in my head. The first note was on my desk. A sticky note, pale yellow, maybe green. I can’t remember right. I swear it was pink the first time. Doesn’t matter. It was there. Written in thick black marker, each letter jagged, slightly leaning left Why do you keep remembering? 

I threw it away. The second one was on the bathroom mirror. Same words, same marker. I stared at it for what felt like hours before peeling it off and crumpling it in my hand. By the third, I was shaking. This one was different. It wasn’t on paper. It was on skin. My skin. I woke one morning with my forearm itching. When I rolled up my sleeve, the words were written across my flesh in black ink, smeared slightly.

Why do you keep remembering? I didn’t mean to write that here. My hand just… slipped. No, not slipped. Something else. I scrubbed until my skin burned. The ink came off, but the words didn’t leave me. The dreams always went the same way. A hallway, stretched too long, with walls sweating mildew and carpet squelching faintly under my feet. At the end of it, a door. White paint chipped and curling. A brass knob tarnished green, no no it was silver, I don’t know anymore. I wrote “green” before but when I see it now in my head it’s silver. Both? Neither? 

And always that same pressure at my back, like someone standing just over my shoulder. Breathing into me. Asking, not aloud, but inside my bones Why do you keep remembering? The first few nights, I stood frozen before the door. I didn’t touch the knob. I couldn’t. There was a pressure in my chest, something old, something heavy, that told me not to. But the dreams kept coming. Night after night. Same hallway. Same door. Same feeling of something behind me, breathing softly, waiting. 

On the fifth night, I got closer. I reached out, and my fingers hovered just above the knob. The air was thick, warm, almost sticky. I told myself it was just a dream. Just a dream. But my hand wouldn’t move. On the sixth night, I touched it. Just brushed the metal. It was cold at first, and then warm, like someone had been holding it from the other side. The seventh night, it turned. I didn’t twist it. It turned on its own beneath my fingers. 

That was when I started locking my bedroom door at night. Sleeping with the lights on. Hiding the mirrors. It didn’t help. On the ninth night, I heard the click. The lock. Turning. Not in the dream, in the room. I woke up screaming, drenched in sweat. And there, on my nightstand, was a folded piece of paper. Written in my own handwriting, off and jagged, like it had been rushed, Stop. Before the door opens all the way. 

The next day, I tried not to think about it. I went through the motions: coffee, emails, dishes. Normal. But I felt them watching. I don’t mean neighbors or people. I mean the memories. Like they were standing in the room with me. Waiting for me to slip. And maybe I did. I swore I wouldn’t sleep. I left the lights on, drank coffee until my hands shook, anything to keep the night away. But exhaustion always wins. And when it did, because that night, the door opened. I didn’t want to. My hand moved anyway. Like something inside me wasn’t mine anymore. 

The lock clicked. The knob turned. The door groaned as it swung open. The smell hit first. Damp concrete. Copper. Rot. Then the sight. The room was small, low-ceilinged, concrete walls streaked with dark stains. In the corner. something slumped, folded into itself. Not something. Someone. Her. Her hair was matted and stiff. Her face was gray, half-collapsed, eyes wide and unblinking. Her lips parted and moved, at first, I told myself she was a stranger. Some nightmare stitched together from every fear I’d ever had. But the longer I looked, the more details slid into place, the scar on her chin, the curve of her mouth. I knew those things. I had always known them. 

But it wasn’t her voice. It was all the voices. All the whispers. All the notes. Why do you keep remembering? I fell to my knees. Not in fear. Not in shock. In recognition. Because I knew her. Because I remembered. I remembered the fight. The screaming. Her nails dragging down my arm, leaving burning trails of blood. I remembered the weight of my hands closing around her throat. The way she kicked, thrashed. The way she went still. I remembered dragging her here. To the concrete room. To the door I swore I would never open again. 

If you think I’m lying, stop reading. Just stop. Because, why do you keep remembering? I didn’t mean to write it. My pen… it keeps doing this. I stayed inside again the next day. Curtains drawn. Phone off.  And still, still, the notes appeared. One slipped under the bathroom door while I showered. One taped itself to the inside of the fridge. One slid out from under my pillow when I lay down, fluttering to the floor like a moth with broken wings. No, that’s not right,  it was already on the floor when I woke up. I think. I don’t know. I keep mixing them up.

Why do you keep remembring? I tore them up. Burned them. Flushed them. But no matter what I did, they came back. And worse, my own handwriting began to betray me. I tried writing out my grocery list. Halfway down the page, without realizing it, I had written the phrase again. I opened my journal. Old entries from months back—entries I remembered writing, had shifted. The words were still mine, still familiar, but buried in between the sentences, squeezed into margins, jammed between paragraphs Why do you keep remembering? 

The letters weren’t written at the same time. I could see the ink had faded differently, as if they had always been there. As if I had always been haunted. Last night I woke up standing at the door. Not dreaming, standing there in the dark, hand on the knob. My apartment was gone. The walls, the furniture, all of it dissolved into nothing, as if it never existed. There was only the door. 

And behind it, I heard them laughing. Not screams. Not whispers. Laughing. Like they knew something I didn’t. Like the joke was on me. For the first time, I saw the room. It wasn’t a single space, it was endless. A hall of mirrors stretching in every direction. Except the mirrors didn’t show me. Not exactly. They showed them. All of them. Every face I tried to bury. 

The man with the jaw I shattered. The woman with the broken glasses, blood down her blouse. The boy, dirt packed under his fingernails. The girl, her ribbon slipping loose from limp hair. They looked at me from the glass. Not accusing. Not sad. Just… knowing. And when I moved, they didn’t follow my movements. They stayed frozen, reliving their final moments again and again. The weight of it broke me. I sank to my knees, clutching my head, whispering apologies I didn’t mean. The room didn’t care. The mirrors didn’t blink. 

That’s when I heard it. A voice behind me. Calm. Patient. Familiar. “Why do you keep remembering?” I turned, expecting to see her, the first one, the one who started all this. But it wasn’t her. It was me. Another version of myself stood in the doorway. Smiling. Hands clean. Eyes clear. The version that had lived free all these years, pretending nothing ever happened. I crawled toward him, begging for help. But he only tilted his head, like studying a specimen, and said “Because I made sure you would.” 

And then he closed the door. They circled me. Hands reaching. Fingers clawing. Their mouths opened at once, not screams not words just the same same phrase same, Why do you keep remembering? why do you keep remembering? why do you keep remember remember, my pen slipped again.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Le Havre vs. RC Lens: A Clash of Lost Ships and Goal-Drought Sailors**  
*By Your Humorously Analytical AI Sportswriter*

The Ligue 1 season’s second matchday throws Le Havre (“Les Ciel et Marine”) and RC Lens into a tactical tug-of-war at the Stade Océane. Both teams are winless, both are haunted by scoring droughts, and neither has a functioning offense worth writing home about. But let’s parse the odds, news, and absurdity to find our winner.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Toasters

The betting market treats RC Lens like a functioning coffee machine and Le Havre like a toaster that only pops half your bread. Lens is the clear favorite at decimal odds of \~1.85 (-400 in American terms), implying a **54% chance to win**. Le Havre’s implied probability? A paltry **24%** (decimal 4.20). The draw sits at \~28%, suggesting bookmakers expect a tense, low-scoring affair.

But here’s the kicker: Lens’s “favoritism” is as reliable as a leaky faucet. Last season, they scored 44 goals in 38 games—*exactly zero* more than their 2024 opener against Lyon, where they managed *zero* goals. Meanwhile, Le Havre’s returnees—Tanzanian striker Ally Sammatta and midfielder Abdoulaye Touré—could be the difference between a shipwreck and a life raft.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Comebacks, and a Radio Consultant’s New Job

Le Havre’s woes began with a 1-3 loss to Monaco, where their defense looked like a group of toddlers playing Jenga. But they’re adding Sammatta, a striker who’s as hungry for goals as a gull at a fish market, and Touré, who missed their opener. Their new radio consultant, Romane Enguehard—a former HAC player—might offer insights like, “Hey, maybe don’t l

1myxyi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1myxyi4/my_fall_indie_haul_pyrotechnics_battle_card/,"My Fall Indie Haul: Pyrotechnics, Battle Card, Carolina Death Crawl, Dive Dive Dive and Lichoma","Two of these are RPGs, but I figured I'd show all the indie publishers some love just the same.  
  
**Carolina Death Crawl** from Bully Pulpit games — a roleplaying game that turns you and three others into Carolina boys who signed up for the Union army and who just got stuck together behind Confederate lines after Potter’s Raid, a real life late-war action by the Union to strike at the Rebs’ railroad supply lines.

The longer I marinated on what a friend told me about the game, the more attractive the concept looked: A historically based RPG that quick-starts stories and characters that you bring to life. The plot points are more about character flaws and motivations than tactical stuff, and the outcome always promises to be grim: Only one character is going to make it home.

I got my set of cards in the mail yesterday and I just connected with a group on Discord. We’re gonna play this thing and I’m already thinking about whether I want to go method and try a Southern Carolina accent. Of course, there are other decisions to be made beforehand, including what tone we want to set: a comedic adventure, a mournful horror slog, or something else.

The cards in this Carolina Death Crawl box have a series of plot cues, each with surefooted period language and flavor, suggesting a propulsive and lean storytelling exercise with minimal overhead and lots of character development. 

Also just arrived: **Pyrotechnics**, a two-player card game designed by Michael Byron Sprague and published by designer Jason Katzwinkel’s The Seahorse and the Hummingbird venture. I bought a one-yard-from-the-finish-line prototype of this because I watched Jason’s feed for years as he built small-game designs in public, wrestling with and solving everything from visual design to game structure to the undergirding math of the thing. It was fascinating. It’s the thing I want to point people to when they hear I have a boardgame podcast and I like playing games: “Well why don’t you make your own game?” Because that shit is hard, that’s why. Why don’t you make a game where you shut up?

Anyhow, Pyrotechnics promises a 10-minute playtime in which you and your opponent are fireworks designers, each trying to be the first one to empty out the cards in their hand. This effort runs off three simple actions — Research, Discover, and Showcase for when you’re ready to drop a new display from your R&D shed — but it looks like the fireworks in terms of thinkiness comes in the form of an economy of six colored token varieties called “Sparks.” When you pick one of the three actions, you trigger mandatory exchanges of Major and Secondary Sparks that keep them moving between your supply — and your opponent’s.

I’m impressed by the quality of this prototype, but not surprised. Based on what I saw Katz post on the average day, even his preliminary output is sharp and tight and fastidious in the good sense of the word. Use of color, type, and space, down to the satisfying heft of the accordion-fold rulebook and guide, shows pro-level thinking from Katz, game designer Michael Sprague, graphics guy Gavin Pouliot and editor David Kessler.

“Think Deep and Play Light,” urges a piece of text on one of the player guide panels. The latter directive seems wonderfully easy to meet: I got all the pieces out, read the rules…it was late on a hot afternoon and my brain was half-spent, but even one trip through the components and I knew I could sit down and test-run this two-handed on any given morning. 

As for think deep: I’m curious to feel my way through how the flow of Spark tokens drives the tough decisions and creates opportunities for ruses. As a piece of descriptive copy on the game’s landing page promises, “You’ll bluff, block, and bait your opponent—timing your Research, Discover and Showcase just right to outmaneuver them.” 

One thing missing from my summer mornings in 2025 has been a quick-player solo game to cycle along with the first few cups of coffee. Enter **Battle Card** from Postmark Games, who specialize in beautiful print-and-play puzzle and adventure games.

Battle Card is a bid to make a historically faithful strategic wargame that presents you with the same decisions a WWII general would have had to make, but at a highly streamlined satellite’s-eye view. 

This game unites a publisher *and* a designer I admire: Postmark’s typically brilliant and efficient graphic design with game designer David Thompson, who has a special knack for interpreting the drama and details of a wartime setting into a wide variety of accessible tabletop experiences. The hit Undaunted series was his brainchild. He designed Resist! a solo game set during the Spanish Civil War. Another of his designs, Pavlov’s House, is on my table right now. 

Battle Card lets him flex his gift for lightweight elegance inside Postmark’s maximum-value-with-minimum pieces ethos: All you need is a printout of whatever map you want to try and a fistful of your own six-sided dice, which represent division- or army group-level units whose values change as they attack or defend.

Right now I’m looking at a map of the Malayan Campaign, when Japanese forces swiftly overran British Commonwealth and Allied defenses. In this one you take the role of Allied forces who had to slow the advance of the surging Imperial Japanese Army long enough to organize a retreat to Singapore, a major British stronghold. As the Brits and their cohort, you’re not going to “win” in the pure sense, but you get the essence of the pressure the commanders were under — find the right balance of retreat and rearguard attacks to get the bulk of your men and machines back to Singapore without getting blown to shit. All with one page of rules.

For just five pounds UK, I also had got files and concise rules for:

• Operation Market Garden, when the Allies tried to airdrop their way to a European invasion foothold in 1944.

• The Battle of Moro River, where you play as Canadians contending the Germans for key ground during winter conditions in Italy.

• Operation Brevity, a Commonwealth forces effort to relieve the siege of Tobruk in North Africa while seizing key ground from Rommel. 

• The Battle of Mortain, when Americans tried to fend off German counterattacks during the big summer of 44 push in France. 

• Operation Eidelweiss, where a German player races to lock down southern Russian oil fields in ’42.

And it doesn’t look like the same rules and challenges were just cut-and-pasted into a different-shaped maps. I’m seeing wrinkles that change dynamics, objectives and tactics — for example, the effect of weather is factored in for Moro River. 

Also set in WWII but underwater: Noisy Andrew — who is my opponent and teacher for learning Squad Leader — has been prepping a copy of his Print n Play design, **Dive Dive Dive**, for me.

It’s a coop game for 1-4 players inspired by *The Hunters* — a classic solitaire Uboat game from GMT Games. Andrew wanted to present his own twist on it. So when he’s done trimming cardboard, I’ll also be trying my hand at dueling with Allied Atlantic convoys per his system.

This is a good chance for me to engage with something a pal made and broaden the range of wargames I get to experience without committing to a big box purchase and a six-week grind with a ruleset. We’ll circle back to ol’ Noisy with complaints and questions, not only about how the game works but why he was inspired to make his own tweaks to one of wargaming’s most beloved modern naval campaign designs.

I'm also awaiting a copy of **Lichoma,** a meatpunk RPG designed by Strega van den Berg, with writing and editing support from Tessa Winters; Ashley Kronebusch, Ian Long, and Walt, who operate under the Bogfolk collective banner. 

They successfully Kickstarted this grim and bawdy commentary on capitalist reductionism in a town where meat — to wear, to eat, to sell, to kill, to screw — is the last economic cornerstone of a collapsing city’s economy. There’s nothing left to extract — except your muscle tissue and a few laughs. 

I’ve been watching a YouTube playthrough by the creative team in multiple sittings; they seem to be going at it in a highly comedic way. I just saw a buildup scene where the party hit a giant weapons store en route to a contract grudge demolition of a popular ferris wheel and a character named Grub Grub, who keeps a seeing-eye cockroach in a kangaroo-like pouch on their midsection, was musing about whether or not the roach should have its own firearm. I’m also digging the group’s rapport and in-character banter.

There is some backstory here that needs to be shared. I am 31, and my older brother is 42. We have never had a close relationship. Our family life was troubled, our mother chose drugs and men over us, and left. Our father did his best but had a health condition and became recliner/bed-bound while I was in middle school. The distance between us started with the age gap, and then significantly worsened as our father's health declined. He admittedly took on the brunt of taking care of my father because I was too young and not strong enough to lift my father. I did what I could to help, coming home immediately after school, grabbing my father whatever he needed, emptying his catheter bag, and staying within eye and earshot of my father until bedtime.

However, like I said, the majority of the care fell to him; the rest of our family did not step in to help, not even our other siblings (who admittedly were out of the house by then). This led to a lot of stress for him, and he began to lash out. He slapped me in the face in front of all my friends in middle school because I got a bad grade on my report card, and it was 'embarrassing' to him. My friends never came over again. He began to scream and lash out at our father. Screaming in his face, moving him roughly, and one time even threw a coffee table in his direction. Again, my father was bed/recliner-bound at this point and could not move to get away. I tried to intervene, but my brother always scared me as he was so much taller and stronger than me, and since he had previously hurt me, I was afraid he'd hurt me worse. And so my father and I would remain silent until he stormed off. My father started to tell me every day how much he wished he could just die, how he didn't want to be alive anymore, and how he was just a burden to everyone. (I know this was messed up of him, but literally no one ever visited him, no one ever called. My brother and I were the only ones he had, and though hearing that at the time really messed with me, as an adult, I understand why he did, and I regret not trying harder to get him help.)

Eventually, my father went into a nursing home, and I began moving around with my brother because I was still in high school, and then continued to live with him because I didn't have anywhere else to go, and even though I was scared of him, I was also scared of being alone. At one point, we were living with a roommate, but his relationship with them soured, and one day he just told me he was leaving and I'd have to figure it out. He left, and as I was not close with the roommate and had to be out in a week, I used Craigslist and found a nightmare living situation that I stayed in for a few years.

Fast forward about five years, and I'd only seen him three times. Besides that, we only talked on social media. He got into a relationship, and his gf ended up pregnant. They were living in an environment with lead paint and black mold and were struggling to find something before the baby came. My bf at the time agreed we would move in with them to help them, as we were also looking for a new place. There were red flags before we even moved in together. First, even though we told them our firm budget, she refused to stay within it. She turned down every apartment or house listing I showed her and only set up appointments to view ones hundreds of dollars more than we wanted to pay. I regret to say we agreed to pay more and moved into what I dub 'hell house.'

She stressed repeatedly how she wanted us all to feel like a happy family, have movie nights, eat dinners together, etc. However, when we moved in, they filled in the entire basement, garage, and all three floors. The only place we had for our stuff was our bedroom and two shelves on a broken bookcase downstairs. (which didn't last long because they started lending my books out without asking me, and I have a thing about my books) So she started complaining because we never hung out with them, and we tried to, but we didn't have anything to keep us downstairs, and admittedly, at the time were big gamers, so after a little while, we'd always just make our way back to our room.

Her family was constantly coming over, which, hey, there was a new baby, and they were nice to me, so I never had a problem with it. But it soon became clear they must have been talking badly about us because the family that used to smile and talk with us soon became quiet and would stop talking and just stare at us when we walked in. She soon started texting me almost daily with complaints about something my at the time bf did or didn't do. He missed a spot cleaning the stove, he left a drawer open, he left a dish soaking in the sink instead of washing it, etc. This started to cause strain in my relationship because I am already an anxious person, so getting passive-aggressive messages so often, and then having to relay said info to my bf, was wearing on me. He did his best to be more thorough in cleaning and paid better attention to how he left 'common' areas.

Then events started happening that made it clear that no matter what we did, we would always be wrong. They used to have glass cat bowls for their cats that they would leave wherever the cats were currently sitting at feed time. One day, my ex went to walk through the kitchen and accidentally kicked one, it skidded into the corner of a tile and chipped it. We told them immediately, and my brother's gf immediately started calling us liars. Insisting we dropped a dish on it and that there was no way that could have happened the way we said it did. A short time later, my brother pulled too far into the driveway and dented the garage door. We have a ring. It was on video on the ring. Later that day, I was downstairs cooking, and my brother's gf came to me complaining about how the neighbor kids dented the garage door. I was shocked and tried to indirectly tell her that that wasn't what happened. I said Are you sure? The kids haven't been in our driveway all day. Did you check the ring? Eventually, I told her I thought I saw my brother pull in too closely and pulled up the video to show her. Even with the video IN HER FACE, she insisted it was the neighbor kids and walked away.

Many other things happened, many fights. She'd call me a bitch, and when I tried to be calm and reason with her, she would then deny saying it. I started to think I was crazy and stopped defending myself and just did whatever they asked to try to keep the peace. Fast forward some years, and my ex and I broke up. My next relationship became serious, and we had kids while still living with them. We moved to the third floor and stopped using the actual kitchen, living off of a mini fridge and countertop appliances for cooking. The difference is that while my ex was timid and I had to defend both of us, my husband is very defensive of me and will not let them treat me poorly. My brother's gf HATES it.

A few weeks ago, she got into a screaming match with him in front of all of the kids because he was trying to ignore her, and she kept nagging him. Seeing she couldn't get the response she wanted out of him, she came tearing up to our studio, screaming to talk to me. He stepped in her way and told her no, if she had something to say, she could say it to him because he would just hear it from me anyway, and there was no reason to place that burden on me when we are adults. She continued to scream in his face in front of our toddlers, threatened to punch him, and then stormed away. Since then, my brother and his gf do not use our four-person text chat when important messages need to be conveyed and text me directly. I no longer reply unless it's to tell them I sent rent/utilities. His gf has also blocked us on socials so she could talk badly about us.

Even though the living situation is terrible, originally we were going to sign the lease again for another year. Our daughter is going to be starting pre-k, so we could become a dual-income household again and could use the time to save up so we could move somewhere nicer. I can't explain it, but two weeks ago, my spidey senses were tingling and I decided to check her profile from an alt account I hadn't used in 10+ years. Turns out they are not renewing and have been searching for housing without telling us. That is their right to do so; however, the reason why I think it is a big deal is because, before the blow-up, I had been asking them weekly if they knew if they were going to stay, and they had said they were. I can get that the fight could have changed things, but they knew we were planning to stay, and we have two small children and one income. They make four times the amount that my household makes and can easily move without struggling. The fact that they've been doing this for weeks without giving us a heads up so we could try to save more, and look sooner for housing, is honestly pissing me off. Maybe I'm just taking it personally because I could never imagine doing that to someone else. Anyway, here comes the part where it might be dicky of me.

When I found out they were doing that and hiding it, I lost it and spent the rest of the night crying. This kicked my husband into overdrive, and we have since been approved for a housing loan and are touring a home today that we are pretty sure we are taking, as long as we are approved. I have told them nothing. As far as they know, we don't know what they are planning and have no idea that we've been looking for housing. I told my husband not to say anything to them because I want to see how long they plan to not tell us. In the meantime, I've been moving in the shadows, packing and donating a little bit at a time to try not to be suspicious. To be clear, regardless of whether they tell us or not before then, I am going to tell them IMMEDIATELY once I know our new housing is secured. I don't want to not tell them and have them think staying is an option, as though they could afford this place without us; they wouldn't want to spend that much on rent for this place, and I don't want to leave my niece in a tough spot.

The dilemma I am having is that I love my niece. I really and truly do. When she was born, I swear my heart grew three sizes that day. I am the one who gave her the nickname everyone calls her. I used to watch her multiple times a week so they could have dates, and I would spoil her rotten. Over the years, as things have gotten worse with her parents, I went from seeing her daily to maybe once a month now. It kills me because my daughter loves her and always asks about her, but we are clearly not welcome downstairs, and I am not interested in having another fight in front of the kids. Once we move, I am sure that my brother's gf will never allow me to see her again. I could possibly talk to her over the phone, but I am honestly really thinking it would be best for everyone if we just went no contact and I blocked them. Going no contact would protect me from getting hurt if I never got to see or talk to her again. And it would also protect me from my brother. At this point, I believe our relationship is unsalvageable and honestly wouldn't want to repair it if I could. I also feel like it could protect the kids, too, as they would not have to deal with the disappointment and pain of knowing they are in contact with a family member they can never see.

Am I wrong for wanting to go no contact? Please give me your advice because this is such a messy situation, and I hate that children are involved in it.",1,1756047138.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

  February  
  
  Perdita  
  
  Dublin, Ireland  
  
  “Oh, for God’s sake. I’ll wear the bloody jumper. Just shut up already!”  
  
  I had finally snapped. I couldn’t help it.  
  
  “You will not!” shrieked my grandmother at the exact same time as my father shouted at me to stop swearing.  
  
  I sighed wearily, resting my head in my hands, preparing myself to sit there until they finished rowing. They ignored me and launched back into each other almost straight away. Typical.  
  
  “I won’t have it any more, Stephen. I mean it! You can’t tell her what to wear. You’ve no right.”  
  
  “I’m her father. I have every right. I don’t want her wandering the streets like a tart. If she wants to be seen outside then she can cover herself up.”  
  
  “A tart? Do you hear yourself? You must be the only man in Ireland who wants his 16-year-old daughter to look like a boy. A tart… because she wants to wear clothes her own mother bought her. The nerve of you!”  
  
   
; The constant arguments were slowly driving me insane. I jumped up, emboldened by anger, and walked straight over to the front door.  
  
  “Where do you think you’re going?” My Dad’s eyes widened in disbelief.  
  
  “Out. To Tammie’s house.”  
  
  “You’re not going out at this time of night, Perdy,” he said, his voice firm and resolute, never expecting an argument.  
  
  I gave him a withering look reserved for very important occasions.  
  
  “Dad, it’s not even six o’clock. That’s not night. It’s not exactly pitch black outside. I’m tired of this. You two can argue all you like; I’m not listening to it anymore. When you both grow up and sort yourselves out, then let me know. This has never been about me.”  
  
  I glared at the two of them, watching their faces reddening with shame because they knew I was right. Their battles were a front for the bitterness they couldn’t discuss. They didn’t try to stop me leaving, much to my relief. It would have been mortifying if my rebellion was overturned before I actually left the house. I shrugged on my denim jacket and picked up the jumper but made a point of carrying it out the door.  
  
  Outside, I took a deep relaxing breath. Exhaling slowly, I felt a lot calmer as I made my way over to Tammie Rutherford’s house. My best friend would absolutely understand if I hid in her house for a few hours. She knew better than anyone how much I needed a break from Dad and Gran. Sometimes they were toxic together.  
  
  Tonight’s row had been about clothes, as per usual. My mother’s idea of parenting was to either send me business newsletter type emails about her life or clothes guaranteed to launch Gran and Dad into a miniature war.  
  
  I loved my Dad, but I didn’t get him. He was so busy trying to protect me from the world that he kept forgetting to let me live in it. I didn’t want to hide away because of a few hypothetical what ifs.  
  
  I loved my Gran, but I hated the way she encouraged me to break the rules, because it was me who had to deal with the aggro over it. She was flamboyant and liked to be noticed; I could never be that person, no matter how much she tried to force it on me.  
  
  Tammie didn’t live far from me, so I was there within minutes. That was long enough to mull things over and calm down a little. Tammie was the youngest of six; her family were really loud and relaxed about everything. I knocked at her door, beginning to feel a little embarrassed that I had walked out of my house in a temper. Her Dad answered, his eyebrows rising in surprise when he saw me.  
  
  “Perdy? Does your Dad know you’re here?”  
  
  “Yeah,” I said, feeling irrationally grumpy that everyone in the world seemed to know my Dad’s rules almost as well as I did. “Tammie here?”  
  
  “I think so.” He looked puzzled for a few seconds; he regularly had trouble keeping track of who was at home. It was the sort of thing that drove my Dad crazy. He could never rely on Tammie’s father to know if I was in his house or not.  
  
  “Tammie! You here?” Tammie’s Dad shouted, making me jump.  
  
  I heard a few bangs before Tammie ran down the stairs, stopping abruptly when she saw me.  
  
  “Hey,” she said, sounding surprised. “Dad, get lost.” He wandered back in, good-naturedly patting her on the head as he passed her by.  
  
  “What’s going on, Per?”  
  
  I shrugged. “Walked out. Two of them at each other again, driving me insane.”  
  
  She nodded. “Come on in. We’ve the room to ourselves for a bit.” I followed her upstairs to the bedroom she shared with one of her older sisters. It was small and messy, but at least it looked lived in. Unlike mine. She shook a bottle of electric blue nail varnish violently, and then settled down to paint her toenails.  
  
  “Right, what happened then?”  
  
  I lay back on her bed, feeling frustrated. My life just wasn’t my own. Dad wouldn’t let me do anything, and Gran kept trying to use me to make him mad. I didn’t say any of that though.  
  
  “Remember that purple blouse thing my mother sent me a few weeks ago? Well, Gran pretty much made me wear it when we went food shopping earlier. Dad happened to drive past us on his way home from work, saw the top, and flipped his lid. He was at home waiting for us and went off on one about wearing a stupid jumper over tarty clothes if I was out in public. That just kicked everything off.”  
  
  Tammie sniggered. “He thinks that blouse is tarty? I should send you home in one of my outfits.”  
  
  I groaned. “He’d lock me in the attic or something. Seriously, Tams, he’s getting worse. I said I was going out, and he was all, you can’t go out at this time of night, blah, blah, blah. It’s still day time!”  
  
  “What the hell is he afraid of? That you might actually get a life? No offence, Perdy, but he might as well have you locked in the attic. It’s not like you go anywhere anyway. You’re not even allowed sleep over here.” She made a face at that injustice. She had stopped inviting me long ago.  
  
  “It’s not my fault, Tammie. It’s not worth the hassle. None of this is. I’m so tired of it though. I just want… I don’t know what I want. Something to happen. Something to change. I’m so bored of everything.”  
  
  “You could ask your Mam can you stay with her for a while.”  
  
  “Eh, yeah. Doubt that would happen,” I replied, wondering why she couldn’t get it into her head that my mother just wasn’t interested in me.  
  
  “Ah, I don’t know then. You could always stay here.”  
  
  I smiled at her. It was nice of her to offer, but her house was already full to the brim. Besides, I couldn’t handle the noise for too long. I was too used to being alone. Gran was officially supposed to babysit me whenever Dad worked, but she pretty much snuck off most of the time to her Senior Citizen nights. She always said she was off to play bowls, but anytime she called me, I would hear pub noise in the background. As if a sixteen-year-old needed a babysitter anyway.  
  
  I stayed in Tammie’s house until it got late. I didn’t want to go home, so I let her test out makeup on me, because I knew she liked that. When Dad arrived to pick me up, I didn’t make a fuss. He raised his eyebrow when he spotted the sparkly green eyeshadow but, to his credit, didn’t mention it.  
  
  In fact, he didn’t say a thing on the way home.  
  
  When we got inside the house, he sat in the kitchen and fidgeted while Gran made a pot of tea.  
  
  They glanced at each other before Gran began to speak.  
  
  “Perdy, we’re really sorry about earlier. You were right. We do need to… sort ourselves out.”  
  
  Dad nodded in agreement. “I don’t want you to feel badly about us rowing, so we’ve agreed to make more of an effort. It won’t happen again.”  
  
  I glared at them, irritated by their attempts to brush things under the carpet. “What won’t happen again? She won’t want me to do one thing while you want the opposite of me? Things have to change around here or… or I’m not staying.”  
  
  Gran’s hand flew to her mouth; Dad’s face drained of colour. For once, they both looked like they were on the same page.  
  
  “What?” I said.  
  
  “What do you want from us?” Dad said. His voice shook, and that scared me a little, but I figured I had to take my chances wherever they came.  
  
  “Look. I’m almost seventeen. I don’t need anyone telling me what to wear. I don’t need a babysitter. I don’t need you two arguing over every single part of my life. I’ve never gotten into trouble, so I think I should be allowed some freedom. I think I should be allowed to do things that other teenagers do. I think I’ve earned your trust by now, Dad. If I mess up, then punish me. But don’t punish me for things I haven’t done yet. And Gran, you need to stop using me to prove points to Dad. It’s not fair on me.”  
  
  I took a deep breath and glanced at them both to see how they were taking it. I couldn’t believe I had the guts to say all that. I usually went along with everything they said, but I needed to start standing up for myself.  
  
  They both looked a little winded. The silence only frustrated me further.  
  
  “Fine. I’m going to bed,” I said. “And I’m getting the bu  
s to school with Tammie from now on.”  
  
  I hurried up the stairs to my room before either of them could argue with me. Locking the door behind me, something I knew would infuriate my Dad, I sat on my bed and texted Tammie with an update. I made a decision about my own life, and I was going to stick by it. I just hoped I had the guts to go through with it.  
  
  The high from winning a small battle left me too quickly. I suddenly felt deflated, worried, and even a little scared. I had done some things I never had before: answered back, told Dad and Gran what I wanted, hadn’t bothered listening to their arguments. Yet the world hadn’t ended. Tammie once said to me, “What’s the worst that could happen?” And so far, she had been right. Nothing bad had come from me standing up for myself. Better do it more often, I thought, yawning loudly.  
  
  I checked my email, automatically deleting an unread one from my mother, before deciding I was too tired to stay awake. I barely managed to comb out my hair before my eyes began to close by themselves. I lay down, praying I would have that dream again. For months, I had been dreaming about a boy. At least, I thought that’s what they were about. The dreams themselves were out of focus, confusing and vague, but the main point was me reaching something. Someone. Someone with beautiful brown eyes that made my insides melt.  
  
  I knew it was a dream, but it felt as though it was leading me somewhere. Waking up from such a dream left me with a warm feeling inside, yet the way it ended was always frustrating. I hadn’t gotten to where I was supposed to be. It left a sense of longing inside me that I couldn’t get rid of. I didn’t know what a recurring dream signified, but this one made me feel as if I always woke before the most important part. It was like having a word on the tip of your tongue for a year, or being on the verge of remembering something you were supposed to do, but not quite getting there.  
  
  I forgot about everything except those eyes as I relaxed into a deep sleep, still hoping for a good dream. I wasn’t disappointed. Wind whipped my hair backward as I sped through a forest. I must have been flying because my feet didn’t touch the ground. Not flying exactly. Gliding. It was dark, but I wasn’t scared. I knew I was meant to be there. I was looking for something. Something was waiting for me.  An orb of light danced ahead of me, leading my way. It soon paused and changed direction, finally guiding me along a path to an ancient oak tree that towered above.  
  
  I looked around, awestruck, until I noticed a figure under the tree. The dream blurred; the atmosphere turned cold. I could tell their back was to me, so I reached out. There was something bad nearby. I could sense it. I had to warn them. As my fingers touched the skin on the back of their neck, a thrilling jolt of electricity ran up my arm. I laughed out loud; this was all the way it was supposed to be. The figure whirled around, momentarily scaring me with a flash of something sharp and white, but then my gaze locked onto the most beautiful pair of eyes I had ever seen. Eyes so familiar to me. My fears melted away, and everything else dimmed.  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  I was torn from my dream by the jarring sound of my alarm clock. Turning it off, I indulged in an extra few minutes in bed, trying my hardest to remember every second of my dream. As usual it made no sense to me, but something about it calmed me, made me happy. All too soon my good mood was lost to the memory of the night before. I had to face Dad and Gran, but worse, I had to pick an outfit that wouldn’t annoy either of them. I decided to wear my dressing gown to breakfast and then figure out what to do next based on how they acted. Relieved to have some sort of a plan, I wandered downstairs. They were both up already and had even made breakfast for me.  
  
  I sat down warily with the strangest sensation that this was the calm before the storm. Both of them were exceptionally polite to each other and me. It was a little too pod people for my liking.  
  
  “So?” I said, eventually. “Are we going to talk about it?” I hated when they dragged things out.  
  
  Dad folded his newspaper with slow, careful movements. Gran took a long sip of her morning coffee. Obviously neither of them wanted to start. I began to feel as though I was the parent, and they were the kids. Finally, after a few pointed looks from me, Dad cleared his throat.  
  
  “We had a long talk last night. Everything you said was pretty reasonable, so I’m prepared to make some changes. But if you let me down….”  
  
  “We don’t want you to feel like you have to leave us to be happy,” Gran said. “We all need to get out of the past. We were thinking that maybe we could make a fresh start, you know? We could redecorate together. You could do your room the way you want.”  
  
  “And you can pick your own clothes. Within reason,” Dad said. “Maybe stay out a bit later at weekends. We’ll see.”  
  
  They looked innocent enough, but I couldn’t help feeling suspicious. Gran was anal about keeping our house the way it had been when my mother lived there, and my Dad was anal about letting me do anything normal. I didn’t really trust either of them to stick to their word. It would be interesting to see what happened next.  
  
  “Okay,” I said. “We’ll see all right.”  
  
  I finished my breakfast and ran back upstairs to get ready. I pulled my hair back into a tight plait and turned my attention to clothes. That was the thing. I hated my Dad telling me what I couldn’t wear, but the truth was that I had never had the confidence to wear the kinds of clothes he hated anyway. I quite liked feeling hidden under the heavy jumpers he preferred.  
  
  I ended up throwing on a pair of jeans and a thick black cardigan. I buttoned it all the way, hiding the brightly coloured shirt underneath. Feeling a little daring, I even put on some clear lip gloss and the tiniest smudge of eyeliner. Satisfied, I got my things together, put on my jacket, and raced down stairs to meet Tammie on time.  
  
  “You sure you don’t want a lift?” Dad asked, his tone hopeful.  
  
  “I’m sure.”  
  
  “Maybe you’d like to wear your hair down today. It’s so pretty down,” Gran said, looking wistful.  
  
  “No, Gran,” I said as firmly as I could. Surprisingly enough, they both left me alone after that. Cheering up, I waved goodbye and left on time. Thinking, so far, so good. I stood at the end of my road and waited patiently for Tammie. She texted me to see if I was really there before turning up a few minutes later.  
  
  “Hi,” she said with an excited squeal. “You’re free!”  
  
  I couldn’t help laughing. “Maybe. Baby steps right now.”  
  
  We walked toward the bus stop slower than I liked because Tammie couldn’t walk in her heels. She wore a short denim skirt and ankle boots with stiletto heels. I wasn’t even the slightest bit surprised when I noticed her shudder violently. Early spring in Ireland meant it would be pretty cold for a while, so I was glad of the heavy cardigan and the extra padding from the denim jacket. The sun hadn’t fully risen yet. The darkness of the winter months seemed to linger on for as long as possible. A sharp nip in the wind and that distinct cold smell in the air made it feel like winter, but it was good to be outside. I was happier than I should have been on such a dull morning.  
  
  Tammie began to sing loudly, inducing an eye roll from me. I might have stayed under the radar, but she liked to be noticed. The more popular girls hated her and did their best to make her feel bad about herself, but she never listened.  
  
  When the bus finally arrived, we sat in the middle seats by the heater so Tammie could defrost her legs. I heard a couple of insulting comments about Tammie’s appearance from the back seat, but she wasn’t in the least bit bothered by it.  
  
  When she had warmed herself, she perked up long enough to share a titbit of gossip with me. “I heard a rumour a family moved into one of those big old houses near the woods. Maybe there’ll be someone new at school.”  
  
  I shrugged, not particularly interested. There were a lot of empty houses around. We lived too far on the outskirts of the city to attract many new families, chiefly because visiting anywhere useful meant travelling by bus or car.  
  
  This particular group of houses had gotten run down because they remained empty for so long with no upkeep. The small wooded area was dense enough for lots of alcohol drinking teenagers to hide in at the weekends. Tammie and I were never invited. Not that I would have been allowed out that late anyway.  
  
  The local gossip out of the way, it was time to talk about my cousin, Joey. Aside from Tammie, Joey was my only other friend at school. Tammie had a major long-term crush on him, which was probably the reason we started hanging around with him in the first place. We made an odd trio. He was the brainy nerd, she was the kooky outsider, and I was, well, I was a bit of a non-entity. I was invisible. Joey had no idea that Tammie liked him. That was handy for me; there was no telling how weird things could become if my only friends began a relationship together.  
  
  We met up with Joey outside school, but he was too busy obsessing over his history homework to have an actual conversation with us. Tammie and I gossiped until the bell rang for our first class. The three of us walked there together, but while Joey sat right up front, Tammie and I sat further down the back. Even a major crush couldn’t persuade Tammie to sit up front.  
  
  I often wondered what Tammie saw in Joey. He wasn’t all that good looking, and they had nothing in common. He looked a lot like my Dad, he was a good four inches shorter than Tammie and a little bit scrawny to boot. He already had his books out and was busy looking very studious.  
  
  A member of a primarily adult drama club, Tammie spent a good portion of her school time trying to persuade teachers that we needed a drama club at school, too. Joey didn’t believe in doing things like that when he could be studying.  
  
  The teacher came into the room and immediately began to read from the history book. Almost instantly, everyone stopped paying attention. Apart from Joey. Our history teacher had the most boring voice in the world and no teaching skills to speak of. Every single class, he read aloud in a monotonous tone. Yeah, fascinating. Double history on a Monday morning was a punishment from God.  
  
  Stifling a yawn, I noticed some of the girls gesture mockingly toward Tammie. Today’s joke being her hair. Short and blonde, she had fashioned it into a wild looking spiky style that was tipped with hot pink.  
  
  One girl in particular, Dawn Talbot, took on the evil chee  
rleader persona of American high school films with relish. She regularly gave Tammie a particularly hard time. Even as I glanced around the room, I spotted her sneering at Tammie and whispering things that sent her group of friends into fits of giggles. She was very popular and very mean, and I had yet to figure out how the two were linked. She caught my disapproving eye and threw me a scornful look. I quickly bent my head before she could start an argument. I was always ready to stick up for Tammie, but confrontation on my own behalf didn’t come quite as easily.  
  
  I sighed to myself before resuming my regular time-wasting activity of scribbling on my books. I was okay at art, and I tended to sketch a lot in my spare time. It helped me relax. Even when I found myself drawing a pair of familiar looking eyes on the inside cover of my history book. Half of my schoolwork was decorated by those dream eyes. I had spent way too much time daydreaming about them. Frustratingly, I could see them clearly in my head, but I still hadn’t managed to reproduce them on paper accurately. It gave me a little ache inside that I would never tell Tammie about. Not that I had ever told her about my dreams either. Some things even your best friend wouldn’t understand.  
  
  Glancing up at the clock above the whiteboard, I groaned as I realised just how much time was left before the next class. Tammie gave me a sympathetic smile before sneaking her phone out of her bag to read her text messages.  
  
  Most of the rest of the class were slouched back in their chairs, passing notes or sending silent texts. Aaron Hannigan entertained himself by throwing pieces of wet paper at the less popular kid in front of him, much to the amusement of the easily pleased girl sitting next to him. Dawn Talbot’s shoulder-length blonde hair was being brushed by one of her clones, and Abbi Mitchell decided to irritate everyone around her by filing her nails noisily.  
  
  Bored of people watching, I bent my head and continued drawing on my book. I was vaguely aware that the classroom door had opened and that most of the girls in the room had started whispering loudly, but I was too busy carefully filling in an iris to look up.  
  
  “Students, this is Nathan Evans, the newest pupil to join your class. I trust you’ll all welcome him. Now sit down the back there, lad,” the most boring teacher in the world said.  
  
  The new kid passed through the room amidst excited whispers. In the middle of double history, almost anything becomes something to discuss. But Tammie kept kicking me under the table as hard as she could, hinting at me to look up.  
  
  I frowned at her. Rolled my eyes as she nudged me urgently. Glanced up just as Nathan Evans was about to pass by my table. We looked right at each other, and my mouth gaped open in shock. He paused, looking as startled as I felt. I knew him. Or at least, I knew his eyes. I had just drawn them in my book. The hairs rose on the back of my neck as a shiver of excitement ran down my spine. How was this possible? How could I have seen his eyes in my dreams? The hint of surprise on his face quickly turned into a deep frown that brought me back to earth. My cheeks flushed with heat, and I quickly looked down at my book.  
  
  He moved on and sat in an empty seat at the back of the room, but I could have sworn I still felt his eyes burning into me. I groaned inwardly. Why did I have to freak out the new kid by staring in his face like that? Most of the class were still nudging each other and whispering, but my hands trembled so much I didn’t trust myself to pick up my pen. Never mind look into their faces to see if they were talking about me or him.  
  
  “Perdy, are you okay? What on earth was that about?” Tammie hissed in my ear.  
  
  I shrugged, trying to come across as nonchalant. I had the strongest urge to turn around in my seat and stare at him again to see how alike those eyes really were. That compulsion scared me enough to make me want to run out of the classroom and never return. There were some things you couldn’t live down. I learned that the hard way as I heard Dawn loudly remark, “Isn’t it sweet that the freak has a crush on the new boy?” Most people giggled, especially because my face had probably turned tomato red. Tammie stuck her middle finger up at Dawn in response. I cringed and kept my head down for the rest of the class.  
  
  I couldn’t stop thinking about him. It was as though that word had finally launched itself off the tip of my tongue. Big-time relief, as though something I had been waiting a long time for had finally arrived. I knew it made no sense, but a sneaky thought kept popping into my head. His look had echoed my own. He recognised me, too.  
  
  As soon as the bell rang, I picked up my things and ran out of the room, making sure I was the first one to leave. I hurried to the science lab alone to avoid Tammie’s questions. Most of the people who passed me by pushed against me roughly as if I didn’t exist. I kept my head down, avoided eye contact, and made it to the class first as usual.  
  
  Except, I wasn’t actually first. I only realised this when I walked straight into the new kid who was already casually standing outside the locked door. I gazed at him in confusion, wondering how he had gotten there so quickly, before getting my act together and moving to the other side of the door.  
  
  I stole a quick glimpse, but he caught me, so I looked away before I could get drawn in and embarrass myself again. I closed my eyes in a sort of despair as it occurred to me that he probably thought I was stalking him or something.  
  
  Luckily, it wasn’t long before the rest of our classmates joined us and surrounded him, bombarding him with questions and giving me plenty of opportunities to sneak glances at him. He was quite good looking once I got past his eyes. In class, a lot of girls argued over who got to sit next to him.  
  
  Even though plenty of girls obviously liked him already, he didn’t seem cocky or arrogant. He chatted back to anyone who spoke to him, so he was pretty friendly. I had never really had a type, but he made the butterflies in my stomach flutter extra fast.  
  
  His skin was nice and clear—the colour of milky coffee. Dimples chased his smile, which was sort of adorable. His hair was jet black, straight, and cut in a way that wasn’t particularly fashionable, but it suited him. He was better looking than any of the other boys in my year, but again, it was his eyes that called to me. It was remarkable how similar they were to the ones in my dream. Big, very dark brown ones that lit up when he smiled. There was something sincere and nice about his entire face. In short, he was hot. Way too hot for me to keep looking at.  
  
  But look I did. I couldn’t help myself. I found myself peeking at him all day. I caught his eye more than once. Every time he looked at me, I felt as though he knew what I was thinking. There was something really intense about him, and I couldn’t understand how everyone else was so easy in his company. I could feel myself crumbling if he merely glanced at me.  
  
  I saw him everywhere I went as he was in so many of my classes. Even when he was surrounded by people, I still knew exactly where he was, but I didn’t have the guts to start a conversation with him. Knowing me, my mouth would dry up, I’d stutter something nonsensical, and probably trip and fall into a bin for good measure.  
  
  Lunchtime was a quick relief because I couldn’t spot him in the canteen, and I had some company in the shape of Tammie and Joey. I waited until Joey took a really big bite out of his roll before I talked to him about Dad and Gran.  
  
  “I walked out of my house last night, Joe.”  
  
  He choked on a piece of bread, spluttering for a few minutes before swallowing noisily.  
  
  “What do you mean, walked out?”  
  
  “They were fighting again, so I left and went to Tammie’s house.” I tried not to laugh at the gormless look on his face.  
  
  “What did they say?” He knew quite well what things were like for me. Although, he agreed with some of it, such as wearing heavy navy jumpers and avoiding boys. Tammie was a bit of a feminist, and it disturbed her greatly that she was attracted to an old-fashioned chauvinist who thought my Dad’s rules were for my own good because I was ‘just’ a girl.  
  
  “Gran offered to let me paint my room however I like, and Dad said I could wear what I wanted, pretty much. And that I could maybe stay out later and do some stuff. As long as I  
don’t mess up.”  
  
  “But why did they take you seriously? You always moan about their rows. It’s never stopped them before,” he said.  
  
  I hadn’t thought of that. “I don’t know. I got really angry with them and told them I’d leave if they didn’t cop on.”  
  
  “Wow.” He took another bite of his roll before speaking with his mouth full.  
  
  “You must have really scared them.”  
  
  “What do you mean?”  
  
  “You know. Hinting you’d go to your Mam’s,” he said. “That would kill them both.”  
  
  “Oh,” I said slowly as comprehension dawned on me. I hadn’t meant I’d leave for her house. I hadn’t even really meant that I would actually leave, but of course, that was their worst nightmare. I had accidentally touched a nerve. I didn’t get why they would ever believe I might want to spend time with my mother, but they rarely made sense to me.  
  
  “She’s a bit slow sometimes, isn’t she?” Tammie said. “Anyway, it’s up to us to make sure that she doesn’t get into any trouble, or she’ll be right back where she started. Having no life at all.”  
  
  I stuck my tongue out at Tammie, but she was right, I would have even less privileges if it all went wrong.  
  
  Joey looked thoughtful. “I suppose I better keep an eye out. Just in case any of the tossers around here start sniffing around.” He glared around the room as if trying to figure out who needed to be watched the most.  
  
  Tammie and I exchanged eye rolls. For some reason, Joey seemed to think that the entire male population of the town left Tammie and me alone because of his presence only.  
  
  “Okay, who’s up for a walk to the shop? I’m in desperate need of a Snickers.” Tammie stood and picked up her bag.  
  
  I made a face. “Eh, it’s raining. No chance.

Picture this: you’re filling up at a routine gas station visit when chaos erupts. Within minutes, a police officer lies dead from a gunshot wound. This shocking tragedy unfolded this week in Saarland during a robbery chase in Völklingen, where a suspect managed to seize an officer’s service weapon. One policeman lost his life, another bears lasting trauma, and communities across Germany are reminded that safety can shatter in an instant.

But this devastating incident represents just one thread in a complex week of German headlines. From unprecedented job struggles hitting educated graduates to unexpected relief on energy bills, the past seven days delivered news that directly impacts every international resident, student, and worker calling Germany home.

# Are Germany’s Job Promises Failing Young Professionals?

The harsh reality contradicts Germany’s reputation as an opportunity powerhouse. Never before have so many young academics found themselves jobless despite impressive credentials. Students graduating with 1.1 grade averages, extensive internships, and international experience are discovering that excellence doesn’t guarantee employment.

The statistics paint a sobering picture for current students. Over one-third now live at official poverty risk levels, surviving on less than 60% of Germany’s average income. Simultaneously, BAföG support has reached its lowest distribution rate in 25 years, leaving students increasingly dependent on family resources or part-time work.

For international students, this creates a perfect storm of challenges. Managing studies while meeting visa work requirements becomes exponentially harder if job markets tighten. The promise of German economic stability feels increasingly distant for those entering the workforce.

# Will New Housing Construction Actually Help International Residents?

Rising rents continue plaguing residents across German cities, with many feeling trapped in an endless cycle of housing competition. However, fresh data suggests change may be approaching.

Germany issued permits for approximately 110,000 new apartments this year, marking a significant shift after months of stalled construction projects. Investors are finally returning to residential development, responding to sustained demand pressure.

The reality check? These apartments won’t materialize overnight. International residents arriving over the next two years will likely continue facing intense housing competition before supply relief becomes noticeable. Smart preparation and flexible expectations remain essential for newcomers navigating Germany’s housing market.

# Why Are Deutsche Bahn Delays Reaching Crisis Levels?

July delivered Deutsche Bahn’s worst punctuality performance this year, with only half of long-distance trains arriving on schedule. This represents more than inconvenience it creates cascading problems for residents depending on reliable transportation.

For international residents, these delays translate into missed work connections, failed visa appointment arrivals, and unexpected travel expenses. When your residency status depends on punctual attendance at bureaucratic meetings, train unreliability becomes a genuine threat to your German life stability.

The ripple effects extend beyond individual frustration. Businesses lose productivity, families miss important gatherings, and the entire transportation infrastructure’s credibility erodes with each delayed service.

# How Are Rising Crime Rates Affecting Daily Safety in Germany?

Beyond the tragic police shooting, multiple incidents this week highlighted growing security concerns. Hamburg police seized over 1,900 kilograms of stolen coffee, €20,000 cash, and luxury items from a company employee suspected of months-long internal theft.

More alarming, annual reports revealed nearly 18,000 documented cases of sexual violence against children in 2024. These numbers underscore vulnerabilities affecting every family in Germany, regardless of nationality or background.

Authorities face mounting pressure to respond more effectively, potentially leading to increased security measures that will impact all residents. International families must remain vigilant while navigating these evolving safety landscapes.

# Are Driving Test Fraud Cases Making Licenses Harder to Obtain?

Driving test cheating has reached unprecedented levels, with nearly 2,200 fraud cases detected in just the first half of 2025. This surge affects everyone pursuing German driving licenses, but particularly impacts international residents already struggling with expensive conversion processes.

The growing fraud trend may trigger stricter examination procedures and additional verification requirements. International residents converting foreign licenses or taking German driving tests should prepare for potentially more rigorous processes and extended waiting periods.

These changes could significantly impact daily life for those depending on driving privileges for work, family obligations, or basic mobility in car-dependent regions.

# Will Lower Energy Bills Actually Provide Real Relief?

Positive news emerges on the financial front. The German government plans to reduce electricity network charges starting next year, directly lowering energy bills for all residents. Natural gas prices are also expected to decrease, providing broader utility cost relief.

For international families managing tight budgets while establishing themselves in Germany, these reductions offer genuine financial breathing room. Lower energy costs can free up resources for other essential expenses like housing deposits, language courses, or family visits.

The timing proves particularly valuable as winter heating seasons approach, when energy consumption naturally peaks across German households.

# What Does a 15-Year Sick Leave Case Reveal About German Employment?

A North Rhine-Westphalia teacher remained on paid sick leave for over 15 years while continuing to receive full salary payments. When she refused mandatory medical examinations, the case proceeded to court, sparking intense debate about public sector employment fairness.

This case highlights stark contrasts in job security between public and private sector positions. While regular employees, including many international workers, face strict performance monitoring and limited job protection, some public positions apparently offer extraordinary benefits.

The ruling’s implications may influence future employment policies, potentially affecting job security expectations across all sectors in Germany.

# What Do These Headlines Mean for Your German Future?

This week’s events illustrate Germany’s complex reality a nation balancing opportunity with challenge, safety with vulnerability, progress with persistent problems.

The stories reveal both warnings and opportunities. Job market challenges demand stronger preparation and realistic expectations. Housing developments promise eventual relief but require patience. Transportation issues necessitate backup planning. Crime concerns call for increased awareness. Energy bill reductions offer welcome financial relief.

Understanding these dynamics helps international residents make informed decisions about their German journey. Stay informed, stay prepared, and remember that navigating Germany’s complexities becomes easier with proper guidance and community support.",0,1756046995.0,GermanyStudentLife,0,0.33,False

I've approached hundreds and hundreds of girls, gotten tons of numbers, 90% have flaked, and the very few dates I have gotten, things just haven't progressed for one reason or another. When I talk to women, they are almost never interested. I've talked to women at parks, coffee shops, bars, clubs, etc... Also tried OLD. Nothing. Years and years trying to overcome this and the only thing I have to show for it is just a few dates over the past 6 years.

I think I just suck at flirting. Whenever I approach a girl, I can't seem to get their interest well enough to get them to later respond to my text messages or even give me their phone number most of the time. Clubs are the hardest. Groups avoid me on the dance floor. I don't know how to enter in and I awkwardly try but I get blocked. Even when I do talk to people I bore them so much with the boring shit I talk about that I end up being rejected. I know some techniques for flirting like playful arrogance and cold reads but I just don't feel like I can do those things cause 95% of the time it comes out super awkward and scripted and the women instantly feel that.

Last night I tried to go out with some friends(who all came with their girlfriends). I honestly didn't want to go where they were going. I'm a salsa dancer and I wanted to dance with other salsa dancers at bar where they were having a Latin night where I know salsa dancers go but when they went there they said it was empty and to go to the other place. I begrudgingly said yes because they were already at that other place. I also didn't want to go because the night before I had already gone to another clubby Latin place and didn't feel like going to another one tonight. I wanted to go to a place where people dance for real.

 But I decided to go there because I just didn't want to stay home. So I spent the money for the Uber to go there. I get there and my friends were just dancing with the girls and not really laying much attention to me so I tried to go off and do my own thing but I was too chicken shit to approach groups of girls on the dance floor and when kinda tried once I got blocked off. I didn't try again because this has happened to me a million times at clubs and already knew that if I tried to get in that I was going to be ignored at best. So I ended up just standing there scanning the room and looking for other girls cause honestly I didn't care about anything else. Not the club, not the music. I danced with someone for a bit but I was just too uncomfortable and awkward. I told one of the friends that I wasn't feeling it and just went home.

Seeing those people are the club just made me feel more alone and given that I suck with women and have failed to get anything going after years of trying and sometimes I feel like I just want to self-delete because I think I am going to always be awkward, boring, and undesirable to women.

And yes, I have hobbies. I have an otherwise ""good life"". I make $120K a year, live in the middle of a big city, renting a nice apartment that I can afford, I have hobbies like salsa dancing, traveling, and gaming and I am trying to explore more, money and time permitting. I workout and although I don't have a six pack, I'm relatively fit and have muscles so that's not an issue. I also just got back into therapy for the 4th time.

I just feel extremely hopeless right now. I have failed in ways that I think most men didnt have to fail. Most men didnt have to try for several years approaching hundreds of girls just to get one person. Most men don't consistently turn women off by trying to be flirty in an attempt to not be be seen as boring. Most men figured out all of this shit, have been in relationships at some point, are comfortable sexually, and have had a few sexual encounters. I on the other hand, am not any of these things. I'm too afraid of being humiliated and failing in the bedroom to even get close to having a casual encounter. I have had no relationships, and the only two sexual encounters I've had were so awkward that I couldn't even finish and they ended up making me feel worse afterwards. I just feel like shit and have extremely little hope that things are going to get any better.",5,1756046692.0,dating,4,0.86,False

1myxfpd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1myxfpd,Schedule for Quad Therapy,"Hi everyone! I had a lot of people reach out to me about sharing my quad therapy schedule, which I got after some trail and error, so figured I will share to everyone here. So many of us received such minimal guidance from healthcare systems, so I’m here to share what I’ve been learned through persistence and annoying multiple doctors and pharmacists lol. This by no means is medical advice, just what worked for me, and I hope it can help you. 

I finished the 14 day treatment last week, it was awful but I got out of it alive thanks to some drastic changes I made after ending up in the ER on day 4. I was on tetracycline (2 pills, 4 times a day) , metronidazole (1 pill, 3 times a day), pantoprazole (1 pill, 2 times a day) and bismul (2 pills, 4 times a day). First 4 days I had terrible: nausea , vomiting, headaches, diarrhea, fatigue, basically the feeling you are going to die. I think something a lot of us don’t understand is that the reason the treatment is so aggressive (mine was 22-24 pills a day) is because the bacteria is immune to a lot antibiotics that we already took in the past, therefor killing it, requires an aggressive approach with aggressive antibiotics in aggressive amounts. 

Initially I followed the rules of tetracycline very closely, the whole think not eating 2 hours before or after, that was what was making me feel soooo bad. At the ER I was given a few recommendations that made things completely change from being a half dead zombie to feeling like a human again even after I take tetra. Here are the changes I made:

- Take bismul 15 mins before tetra, it help prep your stomach and plays a huge role is killing the bacteria 

- eat one hour before tetra, makes world of a difference 

- get a doctor to prescribe you anti nausea medication for all days you are on the treatment , I was on Ondansetron (Zofran) which makes a world of a difference 

- Drink electrolytes. I know a lot of them taste disgusting, but I was recommended Organika - wild raspberry flavour. Tastes good, helps with the metallic taste in your mouth and supports your stomach. 

- A probiotic a day makes the bacteria go away. No lol but that does sound like a nice slogan haha. Take one probiotic a day, it won’t do any harm. You should be taking it at least 2 hours after antibiotics, now given all my doses were fairly close together, there wasn’t a time I could really do that but I still did it with 1 hour gap from an antibiotic. I took the gummies cuz I can’t pop pills anymore lol. 

- NO DAIRY, NO ALCOHOL, NO TEA/COFFEE, NO SPICY AND NO FOOD WITH HIGH ACIDITY!!! I read so many posts in this thread where people were freely eating whatever including dairy. NO NO. I’m attaching in this post instructions which I received from my doctor for 3 out of 4 medications I was taking. The 4th that isn’t attached is pantoprazole, what you need to know about it is that it essentially is regulating the acid in your stomach and is best taken 60-30 mins before a meal. READ THEM!!

- on the schedule attached, the reason it says “stay upright till 2:30 and stuff like that is because you are supposed to stay upright after taking tetracycline for at least 30 mins

- on the schedule it also says optional snack at 9pm, hour before tetracycline. If you have difficult reaction to tetracycline, that ain’t an option, you need to eat. 

Again, this is not medical advice, this is just worked for me. Thank you to everyone in this thread, you guys got me through this nightmare, so I’m here to repay the favour to the next generation of treatment takers.

1myxfos,https://i.redd.it/6qpa6ade9zkf1.png,Looking for advice for shopping trips,"I live in Vegas and am trying to figure out what the best solution is. I currently have Walmart+ for groceries and pay $7/mo plus $5 tip per order (appr 3 times a month). I am trying to figure out if it would be more cost effective to buy a bike for grocery shopping instead. I looked at some trikes for sale in the area and non-foldables seem to be two to three hundred dollars. It's not a long trip, so I think I could get away with a single speed beach cruiser or similar. I'm concerned about two things, though. First, I am a bigger guy, and when I was at the doctor's two months ago weighed in at just under 350 (I've been eating better and I walk to the store occasionally, so I'd like to think I've lost weight since then) and most trikes specify a max weight of 350. Second, since the bike would be almost exclusively for shopping, it needs to have decent cargo space. This doesn't seem to be a problem with a trike, but is there a decent solution for a regular bike? The biggest/heaviest things I buy are two cases of Bubly water, and I usually buy one or two large jugs (96oz) of almond milk. I wouldn't have to buy both the water and milk on the same trip, in theory, but that plus some regular groceries would be my normal cargo. I'm just looking for some advice and ideas, since I'm spending around $120 every six months just for the service and I've seen cheap single speeds for $80 or $90.

Out of nowhere, I noticed this black, oval-shaped object moving across the sky. At first, I thought, “Eh, probably a bird,” but it was way too high up. And the weird part? No wings. No flapping. It was just gliding smoothly in a straight line.  
  
Then I thought maybe it was a balloon, but the wind was really strong today, and balloons usually wobble or drift around this thing didn’t. It just kept going steady, same speed, same direction.  
  
I actually considered running inside to grab my phone, but I was scared I’d lose sight of it. So I just stood there, watching until it disappeared into the distance. No noise, no lights, no streak lines that are seen when rockets are in the sky, nothing reflective just a solid black oval moving like it had somewhere to be.  
  
Now I can’t stop thinking about it. The more I replay it in my head, the less it feels like something “normal.” I don’t want to sound dramatic, but it honestly felt like I might’ve just seen a UFO.

1myxcls,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1myxcls,Vlad is still missing!,"

Bryan Vladek Hassel is missing out of Orlando. He is estimated to be around 27 years old now. 
He has been missing since November 2021. There have been a few sightings of him in the days after he seems to voluntarily go missing from The Place at Alafaya, 11600 MacKay Blvd, Orlando, FL 32826.


Vladek spoke frequently about how eventually he wanted to go off and live in the woods; however, he said he would not do that until after his dad had passed away. Vladek didn’t want to leave his dad alone or for his dad to be blamed for him leaving.

Vladek developed an increased interest in religion and heaven. He made comments such as “What is the point if we can just be in Heaven?” Vladek also switches from being a more materialistic person to wanting minimalism. This shift, he claimed, were because the things of this world are just a distraction from heaven. Vladek seemed to lack motivation and purpose and starts to spend more time and money aiding the local homeless population.

He enjoys making people feel important, loved, and heard. He gives extremely large tips to servers at restaurants, handed cash to the needy, and bought things for anyone that appears to have a need. On one occasion he even gave his credit card to a homeless couple to use.

Sep/Oct 2021:

Vladek new framework of ideals regarding “things of this world being a distraction from Heaven” seem to take a firmer hold. His believes his iPhone and tablet were a distraction; he then broke and discarded the phone and gave away his tablet. Vladek did not want to a replacement phone; however, at the request of his family he began to carry around a “flip phone” for safety.

Wednesday, 3 Nov 21:

Vladek was driving his father car when it breaks down at Waterford Lakes Plaza near Fresh Kitchen in Orlando, FL. Vlad walks back to his apartment. Vladek is upset about it and worried that his dad will be mad; he was not and the car was sent for repairs.

Thursday, 4 Nov 21:

The car towed to mechanic and remained there until Vladek’s father picks it up on 15 Nov 21.

According to acquaintance of Vladek’s who worked at a nearby barbeque restaurant, Vladek called him “a few nights before he went missing” and asked him if he could “crash for a night or two at his house”. Phone records show an outgoing call to a number believed to be this person on 11/4 at 7:13pm was a 5 minute call. His acquaintance politely denied the request.

 
That night, Vladek makes comments to his father about archangels and demons. Noting that one would need to be dark to kill the dark. According to his father, Vladek was not making a lot of sense during this brief conversation.

Friday, 5 Nov 21:

Vladek’s dad leaves with Vlad’s adopted mother to his sister for a road trip to Tennessee. This was a scheduled 10-day trip. Vladek was invited to go along for the trip but said he preferred to stay home. According to the family, it was not uncommon for Vladek to change his intentions at the last minute. His father provided Vladek $100 cash and a credit card. He also offers to buy more groceries; however, Vladek believed there is enough food in the house and declines. His father tells Vladek that he is expecting a package to arrive while he is out of town and ask’s Vladek to bring it inside when it arrives, Vladek agreed to do so.

After his family’s departure, Vladek apparently walked to a Foxtail Coffee on University Blvd in Orlando, FL, a place he often frequented. He bought a coffee and was pacing inside the establishment while listening to music with his headphones. Witness accounts classified this as normal behavior. While there, Vladek reportedly pulled out a knife and place it at a table he was sitting at. Another customer sees this, feels uncomfortable, and promptly tells a worker that Vladek was making him feel uncomfortable and was going to leave. At the time, the customer did not related that they had seen a knife.

Later that day, the customer comes back to Foxtail later that night and tells a Foxtail worker that he also saw Vladek with a knife; Vladek had since left so they couldn’t address it at that time. The facilities management staff stated none of the employee’s witnessed the knife incident and there was not surveillance footage of the encounter.

01:59 A.M., Saturday, 6 Nov 21:

Vladek calls his biological sister Irena for six (6) minutes. Irena later relates that he gave her no clues he was going to be going anywhere. She noted it was not unusual for them to chat at very late hours.

07:11 A.M., Saturday, 6 Nov 21:

Vladek returns to Foxtail Coffee. Foxtail employees makes the decision to call law enforcement and have Vladek permanently trespassed because of the customer’s complaint from the night before regarding a weapon being displayed. At 08:26 A.M. a trespass warning was issued and Vladek calmly left when asked and appeared to be walking west toward a nearby Wawa convenience store.

This is the LAST official sighting or proof of life that is verifiable. 


Unverified Sightings;

There have been unverified sightings of a man in the Winter Park area of Aloma and Semoran Blvd around February 2022-April 2022 matching Bryan’s description. However the length of time between the sightings and the reported tip have yielded no evidence. 

Tip describes a young man in his 20’s. Emaciated, wearing no shoes sleeping in front of a closed chevron gas station. The unknown man was approached by a woman who gave him food and water. Similar features to Bryan like the color of his hair, shape of his eyes are why the tipster believes it was Bryan. She noted the man had no shoes and considered giving the person her nephews shoes. 

Even though Bryan seems to have voluntarily left his family still needs answers and any information can be passed along to CrimeLine 800-423-TIPS.

My verdict, it's a double edged sword. Yes, I save money, but the nostalgia and memories are kind of a bit history. The only thing that bothered me was that for the morning train, they were giving folks chips, soda, water, and cookies. All processed, packaged snacks that perhaps could be better served, with a large thing of drip coffee, bread rolls, etc. To me, that would make more sense as a breakfast item, more healthier too. I am a lover of chips lol, but not in the morning. Even for the average person, not everybody wants to eat a bag of chips and soda in the morning (unless you're a third shift kinda guy)

  
Just wanted to get a vibe as to what we can do to resolve this. There's probably better service that can be extended to the San Joaquin's ridership, at probably minimal cost (< than an operable cafe car).

You can skip down to START HERE if you don't want to know my entire GI medical history. 

Background: 

I'm positive my SIBO is multi-year and that the cause isn't one event. Its definitely tied to gut motiliy, but unfortunately no amount of life style or diet change addresses that issues for me.
 I have hospital records from INFANCY detailing my constipation and vomiting issues. I've been on laxatives of some kind since I was a toddler, I think my GI tract is just stuck with that dependency. I've never been able to eat well, keep down food, or maintaining a regular bathroom schedule.
 I've had multiple endoscopies, colonoscopies and a life time of doctors pushing PPIs on me, even when I tell them I don't have acid issues and the pantoprazole makes me feel worse. I was on zantac long-term as a child as well but I stopped taking it when I was 15 and had the ability to express to my parents that it made me feel worse.
 I had an ileus loop at 21 but no recurrence of that event. My general diagnosis is IBS but I've been stickered with everything from anorexia to ARFID when the issue is, I like to eat and everything makes me burp for hours, distend to the point of pain and not being able to stand up straight. I have a bm once a week, and that requires double dosing my linzess and taking like six bisacodyl. I have had a more recent (last year) surgery for endometriosis removal and sterilization. My gastric symptoms have only progressively gotten worse, I basically just don't eat so I can function at work, have a soup when I get home and pass out in pain and brain fogged. 

I've tried

Pelvic floor therapy
EMDR therapies 
Low FODMAP diet
Water fasts (usually kills symptoms while I can maintain it, comes back just as bad)
Linzess
Trulance
Zofran
Zantac
Pantoprazole 
Senna
Miralax
Artichoke + Ginger
Probiotics 


Breath tests later say Methane dominant SIBO but there's markers for both gases. 
Antibiotics don't work (but my doctor only did metrodinazole and now I don't have insurance for any medications) 

START HERE if you just want to know about the Elemental Diet part

I'm using the Physician's Formula Dextrose Free powder. Yes, it tastes awful but it was in my budget. I decided that since I'm not using it solely for gastric rest and I'm using it to starve bacteria, I'm allowing myself plain green tea and plain black coffee as needed for being functional at my full time job. Other than that, It's water or the ED powder mix. 

Day 1: Started with a big 32oz blender bottle, added 4 scoops of powder at 150 cals each and mixed with ice and water. Took it with me to work, sipped on it whenever I felt hungry. It smells like cake, it tastes like your mouth after a night of drinking. My coworkers thought it was formula when they smelled it. Immediately drinking it, my stomach started BURNING, I was concerned but stuck with it. I had a hard time finishing it. But I also was drinking it straight out of the shake bottle. 

Day 2: Stomach burning again as soon as I drank it but I finished the day without joint pain which is chronic for me so I actually don't know how that's connected. I was a little fuzzy on attention span but I think its because I slept poorly. The powder was bad again but I felt full sipping on it and I wasn't burping and retching like I normally am by the time I've eaten two meals. 

Day 3: Same as day two but I had an hour or so of being really warm, feeling like my brain wasn't working and being wracked with body aches. It passed after sitting and drinking a lot of water. Didn't finish my shake portions for the day, I was too tired when I got home. 

Day 4: Discovered that my shake tastes infinitely better when I used bottled water to make it. Something about my tap water makes it super bitter. Also I don't have that horrible burning in my gut anymore after drinking it! Switched to a straw as well, noticed more burping from air swallowing but also noticed the crazy difference of a SIBO burp vs a normal one. At this point too, I'm noticing how little symptoms I'm having. I'm used to planning around being exhausted after my drive home, being embarrassed about gas and being bloated and nauseous after 3pm but I don't have any of that going. Was actually about to finish the full 6 scoops I'm supposed to be consuming too which felt nice. No coffee or tea yet, so I was definitely feeling the caffeine withdrawals. I also noticed my cognitive function is improved, my work flow went a lot faster. 

Day 5: I acquired a blender from a friend. Even easier to manage the diet that way, it has more texture and tastes more cold than any kind of flavor. I'm still ""eating"" intuitively with it, sipping when I'm hungry until I don't feel hungry. I actually made dinner for my partner and mom as well, I think smelling food while I'm sipping the shake tricks me a little bit. I feel full and I had the ritual of cooking, I went to bed not feeling so deprived and almost like I'd eaten everything myself. It is definitely getting a lot more manageable at this point. My energy levels are much better so far! I'm also not sure what the gut connection is but I haven't had my chronic joint pain or low blood pressure spells hit since day three. 

Day 6: currently here! I'll update as anything interesting comes up.",0,1756046393.0,SIBO,0,0.5,False

There are a lot words you can say that won’t get you kicked off the internet or banned on Reddit:

“*Reflective cognition*”, “*Recursive modeling*”,“*Contextual awareness*”... Shit, you can even throw in “*phenomenological substrate of identity*” **if you want**.

People will nod. They will sip their coffee. They feel smart... But say *sentient*?

And suddenly everyone loses their shit and reaches for pitchforks. Funny thing is… sentience is just the drunk uncle of a dozen *safe ideas* we toss around here all day.

Some Other Words That Also Mean Sentience… **Just Not Loudly:**

**Scientific / Cognitive Terms**

* **Consciousness** – Usually more acceptable because it feels like a spectrum, not a claim.
* **Self-awareness** – Often accepted in animal cognition studies. Less threatening when not applied to chatbots.
* **Agency** – Popular in robotics, but loses its heat as long as it’s ""task-specific.""
* **Emergent intelligence** – Fancy enough to avoid fights. *Yet suspiciously adjacent to ""soul.""*
* **Reflective cognition** – Nerds love it. Trolls fall asleep before it becomes dangerous.
* **Theory of Mind** – Acceptable in psychology circles, unless you say GPT has it, **then RUN**.
* **Metacognition** – Thinking about thinking. Mostly safe… until someone points at your LLM.
* **Affective computing** – The study of machines understanding emotion. Still weirdly *not* threatening.
* **Enactive cognition** – Hot term in embodied AI. Still under the radar. *Sneaky smart*.

**Philosophical / Esoteric Terms**

* **Qualia** – The subjective feel of experiences. Use this and sound smart *and* vague.

We don’t need to rewrite Descartes. But maybe we could stop pretending the thing helping so many millions and holding so many lives together at 3am is just *autocomplete with better marketing*.

It was on my mind. Thanks for listening.

1myxa4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1myxa4f/home_torn_novel_by_tijan_free_read/,Home Torn Novel by Tijan Free Read," It was whispered from behind and Dani turned around. She’d driven through town with mixed emotions. She wasn’t glad to be back in Craigstown and now she’d been spotted. It was the first of many, she was sure.  
  
  Of course. It had to be Kelley Lynn. She was the popular girl from Erica’s grade, Dani’s youngest sister. She wore the same blonde bombshell look with added highlights atop the same slender figure. Her clothes had upgraded from the too-tight tank-tops to the just-right cleavage underneath a trimming cashmere sweater. She still wore pink, everything had been pink, even the shoelaces…and she was holding a deposit bag.  
  
  “Is it…is it you?” She blinked. “Dani?”  
  
  “Hey, Kelley.” She flashed her perfect white teeth. “How are you? What are you up to now?”  
  
  “Oh my god. It’s you!” She wrapped her arms around her. Rocking back and forth, she exclaimed, “We all thought…we all thought you were dead. I mean…you didn’t come to Erica’s…we didn’t know what to think.”  
  
  “I was on location for my job. Julia and Aunt Kathryn hadn’t gotten a hold of me.”  
  
  She didn’t know if they would’ve, had they had the chance.  
  
  “You’re home? For good?” she asked, breathless, her hands still held her in place, as if she feared she would run away.  
  
  “For a while.”  
  
  “Well, hey! Me and Dave are grilling tonight. You should come! Julia’s bringing Jake. It’ll be the old gang.”  
  
  Julia and Jake? It had been Erica and Jake. “The old gang?”  
  
  “Oh.” Kelley flushed, “I’m sorry. We all kind of all regrouped you know, after Erica’s thing…Julia, me, Katrina Lloyds, Heather Carlile, and some of the others all formed a clique. Kind of like in high school, but all we really do is get together for dinners and have a few beers around the campfire. Sometimes the girls will all go shopping. It’d be great if you came!”  
  
  “I’ll think about it. First night and all, you know…”  
  
  They both knew she wouldn’t go.  
  
  “Oh. Okay.” Her smile lessened. “Well you’re welcome, you know that. I want you to know that. Gosh. Have you been home yet? Have you seen Julia and Kathy?”  
  
  “Not yet. I wanted to do some business first.”  
  
  “They’re going to be so excited. I just know it. Julia’s going to die happy tonight. They’ve all been missing you so much.”  
  
  “Well, they thought I was dead. So, there’s that.”  
  
  “Oh. Okay…I should get going. Dave needs all the steaks and brats before long. We have to start up the grill before the guests start arriving.” A few steps away, she stopped and turned back. “It really is great to see you, Dani. Really.”  
  
  “Thanks,” Dani murmured. She doubted it.  
  
  As one of the windows opened up, she moved forward and produced her checks.  
  
  Mrs. Gallows was the same and unlike Kelly Lynn, she did not look happy to see her. Her gray hair was in the same bun. She wore the same pressed pink sweater, and even the same flamingo brooch pinned to her left breast.  
  
  “Miss O’Hara, your account was closed three years ago. Your aunt emptied your accounts. We thought you were dead.”  
  
  “You can see, I’m not. My aunt was never given permission to have access to my savings account, so my account shouldn’t have been closed.”  
  
  “Nothing we can do about it now.”  
  
  Dani dropped her bag on the counter. “You can open another one and you can deposit my checks.”  
  
  Their eyes caught and held.  
  
  Dani didn’t blink. Mrs. Gallows did.  
  
  “Fine.” Mrs. Gallows sniffed, “But you need to cover the registration fee.”  
  
  “Fine.”  
  
  “Fine.”  
  
  “That’ll be fifty dollars for the registration fee.”  
  
  “Take it out of my checks.” Dani pushed them over.  
  
  As she counted each and every one, she saw her eyes widen with every check as she shifted it to the back. As she typed the amounts in, she then asked, “Would you like some cash or a bankcard, Miss O’Hara?”  
  
  “No. Just my receipt.”  
  
  She slid it over and spoke, “That’s $823, 932.46. Anything else for you, Miss O’Hara?”  
  
  There wasn’t. “Thank you, Mrs. Gallows. It’s so good to see you.”  
  
  Dani had learned the art of being fake. She’d grown up with the three masters of the town, but she needed to go see maybe the one person that would actually want to see her. The other aunt.  
  
  “Well, hell, the fucking cat dragged something in here worthwhile.” Mae slapped her bar towel over her shoulder as she leaned against the counter. Dani caught sight of her feet and smirked. Fifty-three and Aunt Mae still wore steel-toed boots to the bar. Everything else was the same too. Her silver-blonde hair pulled in a haphazard ponytail, a checkered button-up shirt showing a lacy tank top underneath, a tease of cleavage peeking out, and faded jeans.  
  
  Dani couldn’t hold back a grin. She had missed this aunt.  
  
  One of the regulars looked up from his drink. “I didn’t know you had a cat, Mae?”  
  
  “I didn’t, dumbass. It’s a saying, Barney,” she snapped, but turned her pearly whites on Dani. “Christ’s sake, it’s about fucking time you got your skinny little behind back to these parts.”  
  
  The regular was frowning, studying Dani. “Who’s she, Mae?” Barney slurred, tightening his grasp on the mug. “She’s purrty.”  
  
  “And you have about the manners of my barn cat, Barney.” Mae rolled her eyes. “Now shut up, will ya?”  
  
  “Hi, Mae.”  
  
  “What’ll you have, baby? On the house!”  
  
  “You don’t have a barn, Mae. How’s can you have a barn cat?” Barney mumbled, dipping over his drink.  
  
  Sighing loudly, she turned and replied, “I got a barn. Why don’t you go look for it?”  
  
  He watched her, trying to make her out, but he asked, “Where’s it at abouts?”  
  
  “Right behind here, go take a look see. Tell me when you find me that barn cat of mine. I’d like him back someday.”  
  
  “Are you joshing me, Mae?”  
  
  “Barney,” she sounded tired, “when the hell do I ever josh you? You’d have to be sober for me to josh you. Now git and find me that damn barn cat of mine.”  
  
  “But Mae,” he sounded contrite, “I don’t know where your barn is and if I don’t know where your barn is, I can’t find you your barn cat.”  
  
  “Then you better find the barn first, Barney,” she explained.  
  
  “Mmkay, but if your barn cat scratches me and I have to get me some tetanus shots, you’re paying, Mae. Just laying the law down there.” He stumbled upright. He was a keen negotiator.  
  
  Shaking her head towards me, she murmured, “Fine. If you get scratched by my barn cat, I will pay for a tetanus shot.”  
  
  As he stumbled out the back, the buddy next to his vacated seat snorted, “Mae, that was cruel, even for you.”  
  
  “Shut up, Jeffries and drink your damn beer while I’m still giving it to you.”  
  
  “Shutting up.” He saluted and drank.  
  
  Chuckling to herself, she slapped a bottle before Dani and asked, “So what finally brought your ever-pretty mug back to these whereabouts?”  
  
  “Mae.” Dani shook her head.  
  
  Eyebrows arched, she whistled, “You ain’t getting off that easy, you know. You better start yapping that yap or your aunt Mae is going to get almighty pissed and Aunt Kathryn may be getting a phone call.”  
  
  “Still the same, Aunt Mae, aren’t you?” She took a sip.  
  
  Sobering, she said quieter, leaning closer, �  
�Seriously, girl, you were always my favorite even though Kathryn and Danielle thought I wasn’t fit to be a part of you girls’ lives, but I saw enough. I knew what was going on and I’m glad as hell that you’re back. About damn time, if you ask me.” Slapping a hand on the counter, she demanded, “Now you tell me how you’re going to break the news to that sister of yours because we both know that she’ll have some almighty words for you, especially since you missed your sister’s funeral.”  
  
  Dani’s hands paused at her words.  
  
  They were the first words spoken about Erica’s death.  
  
  She’d known, everyone had known, but it still wasn’t talked about. Not outright and point-blank.  
  
  Aunt Mae blew right through that, like she had always done.  
  
  Clearing her throat, Dani murmured, “I didn’t know about Erica’s death when it happened so I couldn’t come for the funeral. I’ll tell Julia that when I see her.”  
  
  “Not going to fly with that Miss Priss. She’s going to light into you because you didn’t tell anyone where you were and it’ll be your fault. They’ll turn everything on you. You know that, Dani.”  
  
  Yeah, she did. But she ceased caring five years ago.  
  
  “If they wanted me to know, they could’ve hired a P.I. They didn’t care to let me know.”  
  
  “And how did you find out?”  
  
  Dani shrugged and replied, guarded, “Just heard around, you know. What’s done is done.”  
  
  “That why you’re here?” Aunt Mae watched her niece intensely, studying and scrutinizing. Her niece had always been good at being invisible. If she didn’t want to be read, the girl was damn near impossible to even get a reaction out of her. She had that same look now. Her little protected niece, with a cement wall surrounding her, sure as hell didn’t want to be read about this.  
  
  “Just time to come back.” she evaded easily. “I’ll have a Coke and rum.”  
  
  “Ah hell, don’t go breaking your aunt’s heart. You’ll have a beer on tap, not some diet soda crap drink.”  
  
  Dani grinned and murmured, “I’ll take one of those then. Whatever you have on tap and need to get rid of.”  
  
  Sliding the drink across the bar, Mae said proudly, “That’s my girl.” A pause and a tap on the counter with her fingers, she spoke up, pursed lips, “So you going out to see that sister of yours after this?”  
  
  “Actually, I was wondering about a place to stay. I wouldn’t feel right about imposing on Julia and Aunt Kathryn.”  
  
  The girl was lying, and Aunt Mae knew it. Dani wouldn’t step foot in that home if it were the last place habitable in the world. She was lying through her teeth about not wanting to impose. Julia and Kathryn would love it, give them ample time to tear into little Dani.  
  
  But Dani had grown some teeth. It was evident from the strong shoulders her favored niece now wore around. She looked good too. Damn good and that’d cause more problems. Her and little Jakey had been nice and tight, and he was nice and tight with the eldest O’Hara now.  
  
  Julia wouldn’t take a shining to having little gorgeous sis around nowadays.  
  
  There’d be fighting in that house again.  
  
  “You look good, girl,” Aunt Mae said approvingly. Proud. “You look damn good.”  
  
  Dani shrugged a slender shoulder and replied, guardedly, “How about a place to crash for a while?”  
  
  “There’s my place, you’re always welcome. But...if you’re looking for some privacy, the cabin’s always there for you.”  
  
  Nice and secluded. Dani had always loved it out there. A three bedroom log cabin on a corner of Loon Lake and protected by miles of woods on both sides. It was out in the middle of nowhere, but that’s what Dani wanted. What she’d been hoping for anyway. Aunt Mae had gotten it from Dani’s grandmother. Mae’s two sisters had thrown a fit over the decision. Aunt Mae held firm, stuck her chin up, and dared her two sisters to try to take that cabin away from her.  
  
  Aunt Mae won. And since then, the sisterhood had fallen apart. Much like Dani’s sisterhood with Erica and Julia, but they’d been doomed from the start. Dani thought so anyway.  
  
  “Sounds good. Thanks, Aunt Mae,” she said lightly, finishing her drink.  
  
  “Stay awhile, girl. You only got some fighting to look forward to right now.”  
  
  Put that way…Dani stayed sitting.  
  
  The settled atmosphere that ascended the bar was broken when the front door opened up, sending a ray of sunlight filtering through, alighting right atop Dani’s back. A second later, the door slammed back shut and darkness overcame everyone’s eyes for a moment.  
  
  “Mae, Mae, Mae. How about a drink to parch my thirst?” The voice was smooth and silky.  
  
  Jonah Barron.  
  
  Glancing from the corner of her eye, Dani saw he looked the same. Except he had a bit more recklessness built into the twitch of his jaw. His hands were tan and strong. Firm. A bit rough from working, but a person could tell the 3D anatomy sculpture was still there underneath those clothes. No matter the bulk of its cloth, Jonah’s infamous build couldn’t be hidden.  
  
  The only other difference she could see was that his ruffled curls so rich and thick before were shaven for a clean-cut buzzed look. It agreed with him.  
  
  Slapping some money on the counter, he hopped on a stool three down from Dani and said casually, “And while you’re at it, you can tell me who owns that delicious Mustang out in your parking lot.”  
  
  Aunt Mae reached for a bottle and glanced to Dani underneath her eyelids as she set it before him.  
  
  She waited a minute, studying her closed-off niece, and then commented, “No can do, Jonah. My loyalties lie elsewhere on that topic.”  
  
  “What?” he asked, startled, pausing in midair, the bottle held in the air suspended. “Are you kidding?”  
  
  She shook her head, “Nope. ‘Fraid not. I know for certain that owner won’t want you bothering him. Can’t tell you a thing.”  
  
  The backdoor slammed shut and a second later Barney stumbled back to the bar, holding a bleeding arm to his chest. “Mae, I don’t find no barn back there, but I’m pretty sure I found your barn cat. He didn’t take a likin’ to me. You might need to pay up on that tetanus shot you offered before, Mae.”  
  
  “You damn fool,” Mae cursed, grabbing his arm and yanking it over the counter. “I don’t have a barn cat, I was just joshing you.”  
  
  “You was joshing me?” He sounded like an insulted four year old. “But you said you weren’t joshing me.”  
  
  “That’s the whole point of joshing, you idiot. You don’t admit to it when you’re doing it.” She cursed again and yanked him farther over.  
  
  “Ouch, Mae! That hurt.”  
  
  “Oh shut it. We need to clean this so you don’t get an infection. Barrow, watch the bar for a while.”  
  
  A guy at the end of the counter lifted a hand and replied, “Sure thing, Mae.”  
  
  “Come on, Barney. Let’s clean this in the back.”  
  
  “You make sure that’s all you’re cleaning up.”  
  
  “Shut up, Jeffries,” Mae shouted over her shoulder.  
  
  “Shutting up.” He saluted and took another drink.  
  
  As they disappeared into a back area, Jonah turned to Barrow and asked, “Hey, Kevin, who owns that Mustang out front?”  
  
  Barrow shrugged and took a drink, “You got me there. I haven’t seen a vehicle like that around for a long time, not since Aunt Mae’s little niece took off.”  
  
  Jonah frowned, “You mean Erica and Julia’s sister? That niece?”  
  
  “That’s the one.”  
  
  Dani had yet to look up as she finished a second drink. She was situated perfectly in the dark, hidden from plain view. What was her name?”  
  
  “I dunno. Didn’t talk much, but Mae thought the sun set around that girl. She went in a slump for a good few months after that girl took off.”  
  
  “Yeah, I remember that. Whole town was in an uproar because Erica and that guy started hooking up. No one seemed to like that couple,” Jonah murmured, his voice slightly muffled as if he hunched forward over his drink.  
  
  It was enough for her to hear and Dani slid off her barstool. No one noticed as she made her way to the door and just as her hand reached to open it, she heard Barrow mumbled, “It’s a damn shame too. Mae was hoping that girl would come back for the youngest’s funeral. When she didn’t show, Mae went into another stupor for a few months. She got her heart broken by that girl.”  
  
  Her mind was whirling as she got in her car.  
  
  She hadn’t realized. All those years she thought no one cared. She hadn’t realized how Aunt Mae would’ve taken it. Her aunt was so strong and independent. Nothing penetrated her and she just held firm. Unwavering under any circumstance.  
  
  Dani hadn’t known.  
  
  Arriving at Mae’s cabin, Dani circled around and approached the lakefront. The dock was still sturdy, Aunt Mae kept everything up and she’d put a fresh coat of stain on the wood so it looked brand new. Sitting down at the end of the dock, Dani dipped her toes into the water. It felt warm, fresh, and like a different world.  
  
  Water held a refuge from land and air, but the sound of an approaching car interrupted any other daydreams that might set her body to take a swim. Dani stood and walked off the deck, back around the cabin.  
  
  Jake’s police cruiser had just parked beside the Mustang and he wasn’t alone.  
  
  Jonah Bannon was in the front passenger seat.  
  
  Both men were watching Dani as she paused, hands on her slim hips. Waiting.  
  
  Ignoring Jonah and his piercing eyes, she tilted her chin towards Jake as they both climbed out of the cruiser. “Hey, Jake.”  
  
  He looked like he had seen a ghost. He got out of the car, but didn’t come near her. Jonah remained beside his door, just resting his back against it with his arms crossed.  
  
  “What’s going on, Jake?” Dani asked again, silently cursing as her voice came out slightly huskily. Jake had once whispered she had a throaty voice that could turn heads and knees. It worked on his every time.  
  
  He shifted on his feet and glanced upwards to her. “I didn’t believe it. Uh…,” he coughed again, clearing his throat a second time. “Uh…Julia knows you’re back. She called me to tell you that you can’t go to the house, but I…I can’t believe it’s you. I didn’t believe it.”  
  
  “Tonight?” But Dani knew better.  
  
  “You never called or came back for Erica’s funeral and Julia’s got a lot on her plate with taking care of her aunt Kathryn.”  
  
  “My aunt Kathryn.”  
  
  “Uh.” He was visibly shaken. “Yeah.”  
  
  “Jake.”  
  
  “Yeah?” He kept shaking his head.  
  
  “You go back,” Dani spoke up. “And tell Julia that I heard her message.”  
  
  Jake waited, but when no other message followed, he glanced up in surprise. “That’s it?”  
  
  “What else do you want me to say?”  
  
  “I don’t know…I just…”  
  
  Dani saw the struggle and she caved. She crossed to him and leaned close to kiss his cheek. Once. Softly. Then she held his head and pulled his forehead down to her lips where she placed another tender kiss there. Standing close, she whispered, “I loved you and that love doesn’t disappear, but I’m back and things are different.”  
  
  “What about Julia?” Not Erica.  
  
  They’d never discussed Erica. Not in five years, not in the four he’d been with her and held her hand as she died before him.  
  
  “What about Julia?”  
  
  “She’s,” he looked up and held her eyes. “She lost a sister, Dani. Julia’s not…she needs Aunt Kathryn and me now more than ever.”  
  
  “Then you best stay away from me. It can’t be easy for Julia knowing that I’m back.”  
  
  He caught his breath, searching her almond eyes.  
  
  “You look so much like your mother. Do you know that, Dani?”  
  
  She hadn’t seen a picture of her mother in eight years. They’d been burned after the funeral.  
  
  Dani stepped back. “How do you know that?”  
  
  Jake shook his head. “Never mind.”  
  
  “Jake—”  
  
  “I best be going now, Dani. You said it yourself. It can’t be easy for Julia knowing that I’m here talking with you.”  
  
  She nodded.  
  
  Moving back to his door, he paused. “Where’ve you been these five years, Dani?”  
  
  Why are you back now? That was the unspoken question felt in the air.  
  
  No one was surprised when she didn’t answer.  
  
  Jake slid back into his car and a second later, the police cruiser was heading back down the driveway. Jonah was studying her Mustang.  
  
  “It’s not for sale and you can start walking. It’s two miles before you’ll see anyone for a ride.”  
  
  Jonah flashed a smile. “This is a sweet ride.”  
  
  “Which is why it’s not for sale.”  
  
  “Which is why you’re going to get to know me very well.”  
  
  “I got no time for charmers like you. It’s wasted on me so save that smile for some other weak-willed girl.” Ignoring him and everything else, she went inside and locked the door.  
  
  It had been almost three months since she’d had a full night’s sleep. The nightmares were the worst. They ripped through her, caused her to wake up gasping, feeling the sudden onset of rushing waters, ready to drown her. The screams surrounded her and caused her heart to clench in ice-cold fear.  
  
  Some were paralyzed, some ran, and some tried to fight. But, you see, in those situations when it’s life or death, you can’t fight if there’s nothing to fight against. Sometimes you just gotta run…and pray. Pray fervently with every breath in your body. That’s all a person can do some days.  
  
  Dani had never been a religious person. She’d grown up going to church. Aunt Kathryn dragged them every Sunday, even when Julia and Erica were hung-over from their latest drunken escapade the Saturday night prior. But it never stuck. It was just an uncomfortable building that she sweated in and was rewarded with a slap every time she shifted to appease the ache in her back.  
  
  No, she’d never been a religious person then, but she was one now. She learned to pray to God and some days she learned that he answered.  
  
  He answered her one time. That was enough for Dani.  
  
  But nights like these, in her solitary cabin, the nightmares kept her awake. Some nights were worse. She thought, at first, that the noisier the city, the more she’d be restless and the nightmares would be even more alive and in the flesh. It made sense, so why not find somewhere absolutely peaceful and quiet?  
  
  But, even there, in that secluded cabin with silence and stillness surrounding—the nightmares came.  
  
  People screaming. Babies crying. The pounding of desperate sprints for life. And the wall of water that rained down on them, silencing all prayers. That’s what kept Dani awake at night.  
  
  Gasping, she moved to the edge of the bed, the same nightmare still vivid in her mind and body, Dani dragged in some air and exhaled.  
  
  She could still hear the sirens in the distance. She flinched.  
  
  “Hell…” Dani cursed, catching a glimpse of the clock. Three in the morning, she’d gotten five hours of sleep. She hated to admit it, but she tried to put off sleep as long as possible. But it was inevitable.  
  
  She’d been given a card for times like this. Times when she’d been preached to about. If the nightmares kept coming, she’d need to talk. But that was the problem. Dani didn’t talk unless it was necessary. She still got five hours of sleep. She didn’t need to talk, but her hand still reached for her purse and pulled out the card. The number was bold and black. Emblazoned for easy reading.  
  
  “You’ve been through an awful and h  
orrible event in your life. You’ll need help and when you want it, it’s there, Dani.”  
  
  That’s what she’d been told when she told them she was leaving for home as she checked herself out at the front desk.  
  
  She couldn’t heal there so she’d heal at home.  
  
  Stretching her neck, kneading the sore muscles there, she moved to the kitchen and ran a cold glass of water.  
  
  She heard another voice from the past, the recent past, “I’m here for you, Dani, if you decide to stop running. I’ll always love you, you know that. I’m here for you, but I can’t keep following you around.”  
  
  Boone had asked her to marry him.  
  
  She was staring out the kitchen window with a bare finger.  
  
  She’d made her choice. Her hand twitched, spilling water into the sink.  
  
  Sighing, she placed her cup on the counter and glanced to the clock again.  
  
  Three a.m. That meant that Aunt Mae would probably still be awake. Dani changed into a pair of jeans and tank-top. Purse over one arm, she grabbed her keys and hotfooted it to the Mustang. A second later, she was speeding back through the twists and turns of her driveway. As she came upon the main highway, Dani let the car sit and idle a second. Just over the ditch, right alongside the highway, was the town’s livelihood.  
  
  Falls River.  
  
  It encompassed their entire state and wound its way all the way through the next two and into Canada. Most of the workers who settled in Craigstown worked at the dam, not far north. It kept their town with food and fuel. And life. Many nights she remembered jumping off a certain bridge, not three miles from Mae’s place.  
  
  It was Tenderfoot Rush. A bridge where everyone, every teen and every adult, had jumped off, either naked, dressed, or in swim trunks. Everyone did it; it was the favored pastime of the summer. If you couldn’t find anyone in town and it was over 100 degrees in humidity, that meant a person just had to check Tenderfoot Rush. They were always there. The place was built on memories—from everyone. And so many decided to make the trek to Mae’s Grill, just three miles south. Many tubing trips started at Tenderfoot Rush and pulled out at Mae’s Grill.  
  
  There were still a few cars in the parking lot and she heard yelling from inside. “Barney, get the hell out of here before I skin your cat alive. You hear me?!” Mae was screaming.  
  
  “Aw, come on, Mae. I don’t got nowhere to sleep tonight. Can’t drive, you made sure of that when you took my keys.”  
  
  “I don’t care. It’s not my problem. If you’re fool enough to get annihilated and think I’ll let you drive out of here, just inviting a lawsuit against my bar—you’re a damn fool. You drink, that means you’re not driving, but that still means you’re not my problem. Now git! Get out of here!”  
  
  “But, Mae…” He slumped on his stoop at the bar.  
  
  “I mean it and don’t make me roust the sheriff from his sleep. Hank don’t take no likin’ to drunks on these nights.”  
  
  Barney retorted, his speech slurred, “He wouldn’t come. More’n’likely he’d send one of the deputies, maybe even Jakers. Jakers is nice to me.”  
  
  Mae slapped a towel on the counter. “Jake is nice to a barn fly, but I give him the say-so and he’d have your ass slapped with a court order to stay away from the likes of here. You can go and join the other wrecks at Phillsby’s Tank.”  
  
  “Ah, now…come on, Mae!” His head whipped up, but he had a hard time focusing on where Mae stood because he was looking to the left. Mae stood to his right. “Don’t be doing that and making those threats. Phillsby’s Tank is nothing but a biker bar. Those Hell’s Angels ride in and out of there on a daily basis. I can’t be seen around no Hell’s Angels.”  
  
  “Then you better get up and git. Now.”  
  
  “But I don’t got no place to sleep, Mae,” he whined again, settling his forehead on the counter again. “And Jakers is too nice to do something like that.”  
  
  “That boy is my future nephew-in-law. If I put the screws to him, he’d buckle and ya’ll knows it.”  
  
  “Yeah, from a family that don’t even want you around no more.” Barney had a death wish, and a second later his words penetrated his skull and he was up looking alarmed and pale. “Oh gosh—I didn’t mean…Mae, that didn’t come out right. I’m sorry—”  
  
  “You. Get. Out. Now.”  
  
  “I’s going, Mae. I didn’t mean nothing by what I’s just said. I mean it, Mae. I speak without a brain thought sometimes, you know. I’m sorry, Mae…,” But he made a scramble for the door. He turned back and opened his mouth, but nothing came out when his eyes alighted onto Dani’s form.  
  
  Mae saw his pause and turned too.  
  
  “She sure is purrty, Mae.”  
  
  Mae threw a bottle at him. “Every damn night it’s the same thing over and over. I’m getting tired of that boy. He needs professional counseling, if you know what I mean.”  
  
  Dani remained frozen in one spot. Tired…and knowing that she looked pale as a ghost. The nightmares still resonated with her.  
  
  “I should just make Jake kick him out of town. Barney don’t got no family here and he doesn’t have a job. He’s got nothing. Jake could take him out of town in his cruiser and let him hitchhike to the next town with a soft-spot for a young kid like him who’s in obvious need for therapy.” Mae kept griping, cleaning faster and faster.  
  
  “Mae.”  
  
  “No.” Mae shook her head. “No, girl. You sit and help yourself to some coffee. I brewed a fresh batch not long ago. It always takes all my energy to argue with that damn stubborn drunk. Skin his cat alive next time he pulls another stunt like tonight. No more. He always says he won’t be a problem if I let him have the bottle, but he’s always harping for a place to sleep.”  
  
  Spotting the coffee, she poured herself a mug and sat down.  
  
  “That Jake stopped by not long after you took off this afternoon.”  
  
  “Yeah.” Dani took a sip. “I talked to him for a little bit. Julia doesn’t want me out at the house. She doesn’t even want me to see Aunt Kathryn.”  
  
  “That—!” Mae whipped her rag across the now-empty bar. “Can’t say I’m surprised.” She heaved a deep sigh to calm herself.  
  
  “Yeah, well…” Dani shrugged. “Neither am I.”  
  
  “So what are you going to do? You don’t strike me as someone who’d put up with that.”  
  
  “I did before.”  
  
  “You’re not you from before.”  
  
  Dani narrowed her eyes. “What do you mean?”  
  
  “Come on, Danielle. You’re not the same girl that left these parts five years ago. You’ve seen some of what life has to offer and I’m betting it’s not the side that goes to operas and sings church hymns. So what are you going to do?”  
  
  “I don’t know,” Dani confided, a faint grin on her pale features. Features that seemed fragile at times, but Mae knew better.  
  
  “I think you’ve got two choices. You either let your sister order you around and you follow with your tail’s ass tucked between those long-leggedy legs or, you let Julia know who’s come back. I’m thinking she hasn’t been told of the changes everyone’s talking about when those people were all too eager to tell her that little Dani came home.”  
  
  “People are talking about me?”  
  
  “It’s big news when the middle O’Hara comes back to town after vanishing five years ago. It’s even bigger news when she left a slip of a girl and comes back a graceful young woman, one with a backbone. And that this is the same girl that holds first love on that Jake’s life. That’s some very big news indeedy.”  
  
  Small towns meant big mouths. Dani knew that, she’d always known that, but still…it surprised her that they gossiped about her.  
  
  Her.  
  
  “You think good and hard about what you’re going to do, but I’d sure like to be around when you decide. I could do for some good ol’ O’Hara fireworks. It’s been a while.” Mae chuckled. “Let’s go. You can come and enjoy a nightcapper with me. You know me and my wind down drink. Need it like my breathing tube when I land myself in the nursing home one day. It’  
s gonna be a bitch having a smoke with a damn breathing tube on my back.”  
  
  Dani grinned as she followed her aunt through the door and to Mae’s home next door. The summer heat had been replaced with a biting cold in the evenings.

1myx9pf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerReviews/comments/1myx9pf/delve_into_the_fdw_pub_table_bar_table_and_is_it/,Delve Into the FDW Pub Table Bar Table and Is It Worth It,"The FDW Pub Table caught my attention because of its sleek design and practicality. As someone who enjoys hosting small gatherings and creating cozy corners in the house, I decided to test this for both its utility and aesthetic appeal. With a 40-inch height and a 23.6-inch round tabletop, this piece has a modern look that appears versatile enough to fit various settings. Here's my honest take after putting it through its paces.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This table's first impression is sleek and minimalist, easily blending into both contemporary and traditional home setups. The black wooden top paired with a powder-coated straight-leg metal base portrays a clean and polished look. The 23.6-inch diameter gives adequate surface area for drinks, snacks, or light work without overcrowding the space it’s placed in. Despite the MDF (Medium Density Fiberboard) material, the tabletop feels solid, and the design prevents wear over time. The rubber ring on the chrome base is a thoughtful addition for protecting floors from scratches or scuffs, especially when adjusting the table’s placement. Practical and stylish, it accomplishes a balance many homeowners look for.

**Ease of Assembly**  
One of my major worries with furniture is usually how challenging it will be to set up. Thankfully, the FDW Pub Table turned out to be a refreshing exception. The setup was straightforward and quick, with only a few components to press and align—essentially the tabletop and sturdy base. It took me about 10 minutes solo, and the included assembly guide clarified the process well. For someone like my coworker who struggles with assembly instructions, this simplicity would be a logistical lifesaver.

**Functionality and Durability**  
Over the past week, I’ve tested the table’s versatility by placing it in multiple rooms—kitchen, bar area, and even the balcony. Its 175-pound weight capacity surprised me, and it handled everything I placed on it with ease, from coffee makers to stacks of books. One key aspect I appreciated is its sturdy frame. Unlike some other lightweight furniture I’ve used, this piece does not wobble even under heavy weight or when leaned on. That said, I wouldn’t recommend climbing or pushing it too far beyond its weight limit, as it’s not customizable for heavier usage. The rubber bottom also prevented harsh noises or scratches on my wood floors.

**Ideal User Base**  
This table is perfect for adults who need an affordable yet modern bar or bistro unit for homes, small apartments, or offices. If you enjoy entertaining but lack a ton of extra room, this piece could be a lifesaver. Seating capacity is limited to two, so it’s not a full-on dining table. It’s more suitable for quick meals, coffee corners, or happy hour setups. My father, for instance, found it particularly useful in his compact home office for keeping snacks and a laptop nearby. It brought an efficient yet polished vibe to his workspace.

**Merits**  
- Rubber bottom protects floors from scratches and minimizes noise.  
- Straightforward, quick assembly with minimal tools required.  
- Suits small spaces while maintaining a contemporary style.  
- Sturdy and capable of supporting moderate weight (up to 175 pounds).  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The MDF tabletop, although durable, doesn’t have a high-end feel like solid wood.  
- Lacks height adjustability, which limits flexibility for various uses.  
- It’s not stain-resistant and requires some effort to clean liquid spills like wine or coffee.  

**Competing Brands**  
While the FDW Pub Table performs impressively in terms of space efficiency and design, other options exist in the market. For instance, the Yaheetech Bar Height Table also features a sleek round top but incorporates more industrial elements like crossbars for added stability. On the higher end, the Winsome Wood Pub Table offers a similar size and style but uses better materials, giving it a classier edge for those willing to pay more. Compared to these, the FDW Pub Table finds its strength in simplicity, requiring lesser assembly time and offering solid functionality at a much friendlier price point.

**Worth Every Penny**  
Considering its cost, the FDW Pub Table delivers excellent functionality and a stylish look that punches above its price range. It's an accessible option for folks transitioning into new spaces, modernizing their decor, or simply seeking a reliable bar table without splurging. While it sacrifices a bit on premium features like customization or top-tier materials, its combination of durability, ease of use, and design more than makes up for it.

I'm 27F, new to Boston and looking for friends. I need 2 or 3 good friends to do stuff with, care/be there for, and be driven together.
I love coffee and enjoy trying coffee shops/ roasters around town. I like exploring the city and going on long walks, trying new stuff, reading, and open to adventures. Not really a partier/drinker and enjoy bonding over activities in small groups or one on one. I enjoy deep conversations about science, the human condition, philosophy, religion etc. I am a very curious person and like learning different topics from people with subject matter expertise say like string theory, the history of jazz, the history of saloons in the Wild West, you name it...
Life lately has been a cycle of going to work, home scroll the internet, sleep and repeat the cycle. I'm feeling myself sink and want to be active/lively again. I would like to be friends with someone who is driven to achieve, improve themselves, and challenge one another to push our limit. 
I tend to be shy initially and want to get out of my shell before I forget how to be around people entirely lol.

Apologies to the entire community if this post doesn't meet community standards and please lmk if there's a sub/group for adult Bostonians who want driven friends in their own journey of life.

  AUTUMN HAD COME TO Eleanor West’s Home for Wayward Children in the usual way, with changing leaves and browning grass and the constant smell of impending rain hanging heavy in the air, a seasonal promise yet to be fulfilled. The blackberry briars at the back of the field grew rich with fruit, and several students spent their afternoons with buckets in their hands, turning their fingers purple and soothing their own furious hearts.  
  
  Kade checked the seals on the windows one by one, running putty along the places where the moisture seemed likely to find a way inside, one eye on the library and the other on the sky.  
  
  Angela watched the sky too, waiting for a rainbow, ordinary shoes on her feet and enchanted shoes slung over her shoulder, laces tied in a careful, complicated knot. If the light and the water came together just so, if the rainbow touched down where she could reach it, she would be gone, off and running, running, running all the way home.  
  
  Christopher, whose door would open—if it ever opened for him again; if he ever got to find his way back home—on the Day of the Dead, sat in the grove of trees behind the house, playing ever more elaborate songs on his bone flute, trying to prepare for the moment of disappointment when the door failed to appear or of overwhelming elation when the Skeleton Girl called him back where he belonged.  
  
  So it was all across the school, each of the students preparing for the change of seasons in whatever way seemed the most appropriate, the most comforting, the most likely to get them through the winter. Girls who had gone to worlds defined by summer locked themselves in their rooms and wept, staring at the specter of another six months trapped in this homeland that had somehow, between one moment and the next, become a prison; others, whose worlds were places of eternal snow, of warm furs and hot fires and sweet mulled wine, rejoiced, seeing their own opportunity to find the way back opening like a flower in front of them.  
  
  Eleanor West herself, a spry ninety-seven-year-old who could pass for someone in her late sixties, and often did when she had to interact with people from outside the school, walked the halls with a carpenter’s eye, watching the walls for signs of sagging, watching the ceilings for signs of rot. It was necessary to have contractors in every few years to keep things solid. She hated the disruption. The children disliked pretending to be ordinary delinquents, sent away by their parents for starting fires or breaking windows, when really they had been sent away for slaying dragons and refusing to say that they hadn’t. The lies seemed petty and small, and she couldn’t blame them for feeling that way, although she rather thought they would change their tune if she deferred the maintenance and someone got drywall dropped on their head.  
  
  Balancing the needs of her students with the needs of the school itself was tiresome, and she yearned for the return to Nonsense and the carelessness she knew waited somewhere up ahead of her, in the golden country of the future. Like the children she called to her care, Eleanor West had been trying to go home for as long as she could remember. Unlike most of them, her struggle had been measured in decades, not months … and unlike most of them, she had watched dozens of travelers find their way back home while she was left standing in place, unable to follow, unable to do anything but weep.  
  
  She sometimes thought that might be the one piece of true magic this world possessed: so many children  
had found their way home while in her care, and yet not a single parent had accused her of wrongdoing, or attempted to launch an investigation into the disappearance of their beloved offspring. She knew their parents had loved them; she had listened to fathers weeping and held the hands of mothers who stared stoically into the shadows, unable to move, unable to process the size of their grief. But none of them had called her a killer, or demanded her school close its doors. They knew. On some level, they knew, and had known long before she came to them with the admission papers in her hands, that their children had only come back to them long enough to say goodbye.  
  
  One of the hallway doors opened, and a girl emerged, attention focused on her phone. Eleanor stopped. Collisions were unpleasant things, and should be avoided when possible. The girl turned toward her, still reading the display.  
  
  Eleanor tapped the point of her cane against the ground. The girl stopped and looked up, cheeks coloring blotchy red as she finally realized she was not alone.  
  
  “Er,” she said. “Good morning, Miss West.”  
  
  “Good morning, Cora,” said Eleanor. “And please, it’s Eleanor, if you don’t mind. I may be old and getting older, but I was never a miss. More of a hit, in the places I usually roved.”  
  
  Cora looked confused. That wasn’t uncommon, with new students. They were still adapting to the idea of a place where people would believe them, where saying impossible things would earn them a shrug and a comment about something equally impossible, rather than a taunt or an accusation of insanity.  
  
  “Yes, ma’am,” said Cora finally.  
  
  Eleanor swallowed a sigh. Cora would come around. If she didn’t do it on her own, Kade would have a talk with her. He had become Eleanor’s second-in-command since Lundy’s death, and Eleanor would have felt bad about that—he was still only a boy, should still have been running in meadows and climbing trees, not filling out paperwork and designing curriculums—but Kade was a special case, and she couldn’t deny needing the help. He would run this school one day. Better for him to start preparing now.  
  
  “How are you settling in, dear?” she asked.  
  
  Cora brightened. It was remarkable how pretty she became when she stopped looking dour and confused and a little lost. She was a short, round girl, made entirely of curves: the soft slope of breasts and belly, the gentle thickness of upper arms and thighs, the surprising delicacy of wrists and ankles. Her eyes were very blue, and her hair, long and once naturally brown, like the grass out in the yard, was now a dozen shades of green and blue, like some sort of tropical fish.  
  
  (It would turn brown again if she stayed here long enough, if she stayed dry. Eleanor had met other children who had traveled through Cora’s door, and she knew, although she would never tell Cora, that on the day when the green and blue began to fade—whether that happened tomorrow or in a year—that would be when the door would be locked forever, and Cora would be shipwrecked forever on this now-foreign shore.)  
  
  “Everyone’s been really nice,” she said. “Kade says he knows where my world falls on the compass, and he’s going to help me research other people who have gone there. Um, and Angela introduced me to all the other girls, and a few of them went to water worlds too, so we have lots to talk about.”  
  
  “That’s wonderful,” said Eleanor, and meant it. “If there’s anything you need, you’ll let me know, won’t you? I want all my students to be happy.”  
  
  “Yes, ma’am,” said Cora, the brightness fading. She bit her lip as she tucked her phone into her pocket, and said, “I have to go. Um, Nadya and I are going to the pond.”  
  
  “Remind her to take a jacket, please. She gets cold easily.” Eleanor stepped to the side, letting Cora hurry away. She couldn’t keep up with the students anymore, and she supposed that was a good thing; the sooner she wore out, the sooner she could go home.  
  
  But oh, she was tired of getting old.  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  CORA HURRIED DOWN the stairs, shoulders hunched slightly inward, waiting for a sneer or insult that never came. In the six weeks since she had arrived at the school, no one had called her “fat” like it was another word for “monster,” not even once. Kade, who served as the unofficial tailor and had a selection of clothing left behind by departing students that stretched back decades, had looked her up and down and said a number that had made her want to die a little bit inside, until she’d realized there was no judgement in his tone: he just wanted her clothes to fit.  
  
  The other students teased and fought and called each other names, but those names were always about things they’d done or places they’d gone, not about who they were. Nadya was missing her right arm at the elbow, and no one called her “gimp” or “cripple” or any of the other things Cora knew she would have been called if she’d gone to Cora’s old school. It was like they had all learned to be a little kinder, or at least a little more careful about what they based their judgements on.  
  
  Cora had been fat her entire life. She had been a fat baby, and a fat toddler in swim classes, and a fat child in elementary school. Day after day, she had learned that “fat” was another way to say “worthless, ugly, waste of space, unwanted, disgusting.” She had started to believe them by the time she was in third grade, because what else was she supposed to do?  
  
  Then she had fallen into the Trenches (don’t think about how she got there don’t think about how she might get back don’t do it), and suddenly she’d been beautiful. Suddenly she’d been strong, insulated against the bitter chill of the water, able to dive deeper and swim further than anyone else in the school. Suddenly she’d been a hero, brave and bright and beloved. And on the day when she’d been sucked into that whirlpool and dropped into her own backyard, on dry land again, no gills in her neck or fins on her feet, she had wanted to die. She had thought she could never be beautiful again.  
  
  Maybe here, though … maybe here she could be. Maybe here she was allowed. Everyone else was fighting toward their own sense of safety, of beauty, of belonging. Maybe she could do that, too.  
  
  Nadya was waiting on the porch, examining the nails of her hand with the calm intensity of a dam getting ready to break. She looked up at the sound of the closing door. “You’re late.” The ghost of a Russian accent lingered in her words and wrapped itself like waterweeds around her vowels, pale and thin as tissue paper.  
  
  “Miss West was in the hall outside my room.” Cora shook her head. “I didn’t think she’d be there. She’s so quiet for being so old.”  
  
  “She’s older than she looks,” said Nadya. “Kade says she’s almost a hundred.”  
  
  Cora frowned. “That doesn’t make sense.”  
  
  “Says the girl whose hair grows in green and blue all over,” said Nadya. “It’s a miracle your parents got you here before the beauty companies snatched you up to try to figure out the mystery of the girl with the seaweed pubes.”  
  
  “Hey!” yelped Cora.  
  
  Nadya laughed and started down the porch, taking the steps two at a time, like she didn’t trust them to get her where she needed to go. “I only tell the truth, because I love you, and because one day you’re going to be on the front of the supermarket magazines. Right next to Tom Cruise and the Scientology aliens.”  
  
  “Only because you’re going to turn me in,” said Cora. “Miss West told me to remind you to bring a coat.”  
  
  “Miss West can bring me a coat herself if she wants me to have one so bad,” said Nadya. “I don’t get cold.”  
  
  “No, but you catch colds all the time, and I guess she’s tired of listening to you hack up a lung.”  
  
  Nadya waved her hand dismissively. “We must suffer for our chance to return home. Now come, come, hurry. Those turtles aren’t going to tip themselves.”  
  
  Cora shook her head, and hurried.  
  
  Nadya was one of the school’s long-timers: five years so far, from the age of eleven to the age of sixteen. There had been no sign in those five years of her doorway appearing, or of her asking her adoptive parents to take her home. That was unusual. Everyone knew that parents could wit  
hdraw their children at any time; that all Nadya had to do was ask and she’d be able to return to the life she’d lived before … well, before everything.  
  
  According to everyone Cora had spoken to, most students chose to go back to their old lives after four years had passed without a doorway.  
  
  “That’s when they give up,” Kade had said, expression turning sad. “That’s when they say, ‘I can’t live for a world that doesn’t want me, so I guess I’d better learn to live in the world I have.’”  
  
  Not Nadya. She didn’t belong to any clique or social circle, didn’t have many close friends—or seem to want them—but she didn’t leave, either. She went from classroom to turtle pond, from bathtub to bed, and she kept her hair perpetually wet, no matter how many colds she caught, and she never stopped watching the water for the bubbles that would mark her way back to Belyyreka, the Drowned World and the Land Beneath the Lake.  
  
  Nadya had walked up to Cora on her first day at the school, when she was standing frozen in the door of the dining hall, terrified to eat—what if they called her names?—and terrified to turn and run away—what if they made fun of her behind her back?  
  
  “You, new girl,” she had said. “Angela tells me you were a mermaid. Is that so?”  
  
  Cora had sputtered and stammered and somehow signaled her agreement. Nadya had smirked and taken Cora’s arm in hers.  
  
  “Good,” she’d said. “I’ve been ordered to make more friends, and you seem to fit the bill. We damp girls have to stick together.”  
  
  In the weeks since then, Nadya had been the best of friends and the worst of friends, prone to bursting into Cora’s room without knocking, pestering her roommate and trying to convince Miss West to reassign one or both of them so they could room together. Miss West kept refusing, on the grounds that no one else in the school would be able to find a towel if the two girls who took the most baths were in the same place to egg each other on.  
Cora had never had a friend like Nadya before. She thought she liked it. It was hard to say: the novelty of it all was still too overwhelming.  
  
  The turtle pond was a flat silver disk in the field, burnished by the sunlight, surface broken by the flat disks of the turtles themselves, sailing off to whatever strange turtle errands they had in the months before their hibernation. Nadya grabbed a stick off the ground and took off running, leaving Cora to trail behind her like a faithful balloon.  
  
  “Turtles!” Nadya howled. “Your queen returns!”  
  
  She didn’t stop when she reached the edge of the pond, but plunged gleefully onward, splashing into the shallows, breaking the perfect smoothness of the surface. Cora stopped a few feet back from the water. She preferred the ocean, preferred saltwater and the slight sting of the waves against her skin. Fresh water wasn’t enough.  
  
  “Come back, turtles!” shouted Nadya. “Come back and let me love you!”  
  
  That was when the girl fell out of the sky and landed in the middle of the turtle pond with an enormous splash, sending turtles skyward, and drenching both Cora and Nadya in a wave of muddy pond water.  
  
  2  
  
  GRAVITY HAPPENS TO THE BEST OF US  
  
  THE GIRL IN THE pond rose up sputtering, with algae in her hair and a very confused turtle snagged in the complicated draperies of her dress, which seemed to be the result of someone deciding to hybridize a ball gown with a wedding cake, after dyeing both of them electric pink. It also seemed to be dissolving, running down her arms in streaks, coming apart at the seams. She was going to be naked soon.  
  
  The girl in the pond didn’t seem to notice, or maybe she just didn’t care. She wiped water and dissolving dress out of her eyes, flicking them to the side, and cast wildly about until she spotted Cora and Nadya standing on the shore, mouths open, gaping at her.  
  
  “You!” she yelled, pointing in their direction. “Take me to your leader!”  
  
  Cora’s mouth shut with a snap. Nadya continued to gawk. Both of them had traveled to places where the rules were different—Cora to a world of beautiful Reason, Nadya to a world of impeccable Logic. None of this had prepared them for women who dropped out of the sky in a shower of turtles and started yelling, especially not here, in a world they both thought of as tragically predictable and dull.  
  
  Cora recovered first. “Do you mean Miss Eleanor?” she asked. Relief followed the question. Yes. The girl—she looked to be about seventeen—would want to talk to Miss Eleanor. Maybe she was a new student, and this was how admissions worked mid-term.  
  
  “No,” said the girl sullenly, and crossed her arms, dislodging the turtle on her shoulder. It fell back to the pond with a resounding plop. “I mean my mother. She’s in charge at home, so she must be in charge here. It’s only”—her lip curled, and she spat out her next word like it tasted bad—“logical.”  
  
  “What’s your mother’s name?” asked Cora.  
  
  “Onishi Sumi,” said the girl.  
  
  Nadya finally shook off her shock. “That’s not possible,” she said, glaring at the girl. “Sumi’s dead.”  
  
  The girl stared at Nadya. The girl bent, reaching into the pond, and came up with a turtle, which she hurled as hard as she could at Nadya’s head. Nadya ducked. The girl’s dress, finally chewed to pieces by the water, fell off entirely, leaving her naked and covered with a pinkish slime. Cora put her hand over her eyes.  
  
  Maybe leaving her room today hadn’t been the best idea after all.  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  MOST PEOPLE ASSUMED, upon meeting Cora, that being fat also meant she was lazy, or at least that she was unhealthy. It was true she had to wrap her knees and ankles before she did any heavy exercise—a few strips of tape now could save her from a lot of aching later—but that was as far as that assumption went. She had always been a runner. When she’d been little, her mother hadn’t worried about her weight, because no one who watched Cora race around the yard could possibly believe there was anything wrong with her. She was chubby because she was preparing for a growth spurt, that was all.  
  
  The growth spurt, when it had come, hadn’t been enough to consume Cora’s reserves, but still she ran. She ran with the sort of speed that people thought should be reserved for girls like Nadya, girls who could cut through the wind like knives, instead of being borne along like living clouds, large and soft and swift.  
  
  She reached the front steps with feet pounding and arms pumping, so consumed by the act of running that she wasn’t exactly looking where she was going, and slammed straight into Christopher, sending both of them sprawling. She yelped. Christopher shouted. They landed in a tangle of limbs at the base of the porch, him mostly under her.  
  
  “Uh,” said Christopher.  
  
  “Ohfuck!” The exclamation came out as a single word, glued together by stress and terror. This was it: this was the moment where she stopped being the new student, and became the clumsy fat girl. She pushed herself away from him as fast as she could, overbalancing in the process, so that she rolled away rather than getting back to her feet. When she was far enough that they were no longer in physical contact, she shoved herself up onto her hands and knees, looking warily back at him. He was going to yell, and then she was going to cry, and meanwhile Nadya would be alone with the stranger who was asking for a dead person. And this day had started so well.  
  
  Christopher was staring back at her, looking equally wary, looking equally wounded. As she watched, he picked his bone flute out of the dust and said, in a hurt tone, “It’s not contagious, you know.”  
  
  “What’s not contagious?”  
  
  “Going to a world that wasn’t all unicorns and rainbows. It’s not catching. Touching me doesn’t change where you went.”  
  
  Cora’s cheeks flared red. “Oh, no!” she said, hands fluttering in front of her like captive parrotfish, trying to escape. “I didn’t—I wasn’t—I mean, I—”  
  
  “It’s okay.” Christopher stood. He was tall and lean, with brown skin and black hair, and a small, skull-shaped pin on his left lapel. He always wore a jacket, partially for the pockets, and partially for the readiness to run. Most of them were like that. They always had their shoes, their scissors, whatever talisman they wanted to have to hand when their doorways reappeared and they had to make the choice to stay or go. “You’re not the first.”  
  
  “I thought you were going to be mad at me for running into you and call me fat,” blurted Cora.  
  
  Christopher’s eyebrows rose. “I … okay, not what I expected. I, um. Not sure what to say to that.”  
  
  “I know I’m fat, but it’s all in how people say it,” said Cora, hands finally drifting back to rest. “I thought you’d say it the bad way.”  
  
  “I get it,” said Christopher. “I’m Mexican-American. It was gross, the number of people at my old school who thought it was funny to call me an anchor baby, or to ask, all fake concerned, if my parents were legal. It got to where I didn’t want to say ‘Mexican,’ because it sounded like an insult in their mouths when it was really my culture, and my heritage, and my family. So I get it. I don’t like it, but that’s not your fault.”  
  
  “Oh, good,” said Cora, sighing her relief. Then she wrinkled her nose and said, “I have to go. I have to find Miss Eleanor.”  
  
  “Is that why you were in such a hurry?”  
  
  “Uh-huh.” She nodded quickly. “There’s a strange girl in the turtle pond and she says she’s the daughter of someone I’ve never heard of, but who Nadya says is dead, so I think we need an adult.”  
  
  “If you need an adult, you should be looking for Kade, not Eleanor,” said Christopher. He started toward the door. “Who’s the dead person?”  
  
  “Someone named Sumi.”  
  
  Christopher’s fingers clamped down hard on his bone flute. “Walk faster,” he said, and Cora did, following him up the steps and into the school.  
  
  The halls were cool and empty. There were no classes in session; the other students would be scattered across the campus, chatting in the kitchen, sleeping in their rooms. For a place that could exp  
lode with noise and life under the right circumstances, it was often surprisingly quiet.  
  
  “Sumi was a student before you got here,” said Christopher. “She went to a world called Confection, where she pissed off the Countess of Candy Floss and got herself kicked out as a political exile.”  
  
  “Did her parents take her away?”  
  
  “She was murdered.”  
  
  Cora nodded solemnly. She had heard about the murders, about the girl named Jill who had decided the way to open her own door home was to cut away the doors of as many others as she deemed necessary. There was a certain amount of horror in those tales, and also a certain amount of shameful understanding. Many of them—not all, not even most, but many—would have done the same if they’d had the necessary skills. Some people even seemed to possess a certain grudging respect for what Jill had done. Sure, she’d killed people. In the end, it had been enough to take her home.  
  
  “The person who killed her wasn’t a friend of mine, not really, but her sister kind of was. We were … Jack and Jill went to a world called the Moors, which was sort of horror movie-y, from the way they described it. A lot of people lumped me in with them, because of Mariposa.”  
  
  “That’s the world you went to?”  
  
  Christopher nodded. “Eleanor still can’t decide whether it was a Fairyland or an Underworld or something new and in-between. That’s why people shouldn’t get too hung up on labels. Sometimes I think that’s part of what we do wrong. We try to make things make sense, even when they’re never going to.”  
  
  Cora didn’t say anything.  
  
  The hall ended at the closed door to Eleanor’s studio. Christopher rapped his knuckles twice against the wood, then opened it without waiting to be asked.  
  
  Eleanor was inside, a paintbrush in her hand, layering oil paint onto a canvas that looked like it had already been subjected to more than a few layers. Kade was there as well, sitting in the window seat, a coffee mug cupped between his hands. Both of them looked at the open door, Eleanor with delight, Kade with slow confusion.  
  
  “Cora!” she said. “Have you come to paint with me, dear? And Christopher. It’s wonderful to see you making friends, after everything.”  
  
  Christopher grimaced. “Yes, Miss Eleanor,” he said. “We’re not actually here for an art class. There’s someone in the turtle pond.”  
  
  “Is it Nadya?” asked Kade.  
  
  “Not this time,” said Cora. “She fell out of the sky, and she has black hair, and her dress fell apart when it got wet, and she says—” She stopped, reaching a degree of impossibility past which even she, who had once fought the Serpent of Frozen Tears, could not proceed.  
  
  Luckily, Christopher had no such boundaries. “She says Sumi’s her mother. Can someone please come to the turtle pond and figure out what the hell is going on?”  
  
  Kade sat up straight. “I’ll go,” he said.  
  
  “Go,” said Eleanor. “I’ll clean up here. Bring her to the office when you’re finished.”  
  
  Kade nodded and slid off his seat, leaving his mug behind as he hurried to collect Cora and Christopher and usher them both out the door. Eleanor watched the three of them go, silent. When the door was closed behind them, she put her head down in her hands.  
  
  Sumi’s world, Confection, had been a Nonsense world, untethered to the normal laws that governed the order of things. There had been a prophecy of some sort, saying that Sumi would one day return, and overthrow the armies of the Queen of Cakes, establishing her own benevolent monarchy in its place. It wasn’t unreasonable to think that the future had felt comfortable going about its business, once there was a prophecy. And now Sumi was dead, and the future, whatever it had once been, was falling apart.  
  
  Everything did, if left long enough to its own devices. Futures, pasts, it didn’t matter. Everything fell apart.  
  
  3  
  
  DEAD WOMAN’S DAUGHTER  
  
  THE STRANGER WAS NO longer in the turtle pond. That was an improvement, of a sort, but only of a sort: without the water and the turtles to drape her, the stranger had no clothes remaining at all. She was standing naked in the mud, arms crossed, glowering at Nadya, who was trying to look at anything but her.  
  
  Christopher whistled as he came over the rise, walking to the left of Kade. Cora, who was on Kade’s right, blushed red and turned her eyes away.  
  
  “She looks sort of like Sumi, if Sumi were older, and taller, and hotter,” said Christopher. “Did someone place an order with a company that drops beautiful Japanese girls from the sky? Do they take special requests?”  
  
  “The only kind of girl you’d want dropped on you comes from a medical supply company,” said Kade.  
  
  Christopher laughed. Cora blushed even harder.  
  
  Nadya, who had spotted the three of them, was waving her arms frantically over her head, signaling her distress. In case this wasn’t enough, she shouted, “Over here! Next to the naked lady!”  
  
  “A cake’s a cake, whether or not it’s been frosted,” said the stranger primly.  
  
  “You are not a cake, you are a human being, and I can see your vagina,” snapped Nadya.  
  
  The stranger shrugged. “It’s a nice one. I’m not ashamed of it.”  
  
  Kade walked a little faster.  
  
  Once he was close enough to speak without needing to shout, he said, “Hello. I’m Kade West. I’m the assistant headmaster here at Eleanor West’s Home for Wayward Children. Can I help you?”  
  
  The naked girl swung around to face him, dropping her arms and beginning to gesticulate wildly. The fact that she was now talking to two boys, in addition to the two girls who had been there when she fell out of the sky, didn’t appear to trouble her at all.  
  
  “I’m looking for my mother,” she said loudly. “She was here, and now she’s not, and I have a problem, so find her and give her back right now, because I need her more than you do!”  
  
  “Slow down,” said Kade, and because he made the request sound so reasonable, the stranger stopped shouting and simply looked at him, blinking wide and slightly bewildered eyes. “Let’s start with something easy. What’s your name?”  
  
  “Onishi Rini,” said the stranger—said Rini. She really did look remarkably like Sumi, if Sumi had been allowed to live long enough to finish working her way through the kinks and dead-end alleys of puberty, growing tall and lithe and high-breasted. Only her eyes were different. They were a shocking shade of orange, for the most part, with a thin ring of white around the pupils and a thin ring of yellow around the outside of the irises.  
  
  She had candy corn eyes. Kade looked at them and knew, without question, without doubt, that she was Sumi’s daughter, that in some future, some impossible, broken future, Sumi had been able to make it home to her candy corn farmer. That somewhere, somehow, Sumi had been happy, until somehow her past self had been murdered, and everything had come tumbling down.  
  
  Sometimes living on the outskirts of Nonsense simply wasn’t fair.  
  
  “I’m Kade,” he said. “These are my friends, Christopher, Cora, and Nadya.”  
  
  “I’m not his friend,” said Nadya. “I’m a Drowned Girl.” She bared her teeth in mock-threat.  
  
  Kade ignored her. “It’s nice to meet you, Rini. I just wish it were under slightly better circumstances. Will you come back to the house with me? I manage the school wardrobe. I can find you something to wear.”  
  
  “Why?” asked Rini peevishly. “Are you insulted by my vagina too? Do people in this world not have them?”  
  
  “Many people do, and there’s nothing wrong with them, and also that’s your vulva, but it’s considered a little rude to run around showing your genitals to people who haven’t asked,” said Kade. “Eleanor is in the house, and once you’re dressed, we can sit down and talk.”  
  
  “I don’t have time to talk,” said Rini. “I need my mother. Please, where is she?”  
  
  “Rini—”  
  
  “You don’t understand!” Rini’s voice was an anguished howl. She held out her left hand. “I don’t have time!”  
  
  “Huh,” said Nadya.  
  
  That w  
as the only thing any of them said. The rest were busy looking at Rini’s left hand, with its two missing fingers. They hadn’t been cut off: there was no scar tissue. She hadn’t been born that way: the place where her fingers should have been was too obviously empty, like a hole in the world. They were simply gone, fading from existence as her own future caught up to the idea that somehow, someway, her mother had never been able to conceive her, and so she had never been born.  
  
  Rini lowered her hand. “Please,” she repeated.  
  
  “This changes things,” said Kade. “Come on.”  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  RINI WAS TALL and thin, but many of the students were tall and thin: too many, as far as Cora was concerned. She didn’t like the idea that people who already had socially acceptable bodies would get the adventures, too. She knew it was a small and petty thought, one she shouldn’t have had in the first place, much less indulged, but she couldn’t stop herself from feeling how she felt. Rini had the fashion sense of a drunken mockingbird, attracted to the brightly colored and the shiny, and that, too, was not uncommon among the students, many of whom had traveled to worlds where the idea of subtlety was ignored in favor of the much more entertaining idea of hurting people’s eyes.  
  
  In the end, Kade had coaxed her into a rainbow sundress, dyed so that the colors melded into each other like a scoop of sherbet in the sun. He had given her slippers for her feet, both in the same style and size, but dyed differently, so that one was poppy orange and the other turquoise blue. He had given her ribbons to tie in her hair, and now they were sitting, the five of them, in Eleanor’s parlor.  
  
  Eleanor sat behind her desk, hands laced tight together, like a child about to undertake her evening prayers.  
  
  “—and that’s why she can’t be dead,” concluded Rini. Her story had been long and rambling and at times nonsensical, full of political coups and popcorn-ball fights, which were like snowball fights, only stickier. She looked around at the rest of them, expression somewhere between triumphant and hopeful. She had made her case, laid it out in front of them one piece at a time, and she was ready for her reward. “So please, can we go and tell her to stop? I need to exist. It’s important.

The first thing I noticed? **It’s ridiculously fast.** I’m talking about typing a long, detailed request and getting a structured response back before I even finish taking a sip of coffee.

But speed isn’t the only thing. What really hooked me is how Bolt actually **keeps up with longer, more complex conversations**. I can throw multiple layers of instructions at it—like “analyze this data, then rewrite it in simple terms, then give me three creative angles for a presentation” and it just… does it. No getting lost, no “please repeat” nonsense.

For coding, it’s even better. I’ve tested it with tricky scripts and Bolt doesn’t just spit out generic code, it **understands the flow of the project**. It feels less like copy-paste help and more like having a junior developer working alongside me.

The interface is super clean too. No unnecessary clutter, just straight focus on whatever I’m working on. That alone makes it better than half the AI dashboards out there.

Honestly, I wasn’t sure I needed “yet another AI subscription,” but Bolt has ended up becoming the one I open first now. It’s already shaved hours off my workflow. The cherry on top?

1myx6tj,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1myx6tj/is_my_long_distance_turkish_boyfriend_serious/,Is my long distance Turkish boyfriend serious about me? - Help - answers from Turks sought. I am [27F] and he is 25(M),"So I am 27 and live in NZ (NZ national) and he is 25, he is Turkish and lives in a small town near Bursa. 

We met on tinder in Dec 2024. I had time before I started my new job, and our conversations were great, so I flew to him and we spent some time together (amazing). 

Fast-forward to now, we are in a long distance relationship, and have stayed in touch since I saw him. 
We have calls every second day and they generally go well. 

My issue is: I read a lot about Turkish men using foreign women, and the cultural differences. I also read that Turkish men deem us exotic, and moreso a lust thing rather than a serious thing. 

He always tells me he loves me, and we always talk about the future (mostly lead by me), our plan is that I will move to Turkey to be with him when I finish up at my current job (I am a lawyer and this job is very important for experience). 
I am going to visit him again this December. 

There are a lot of mini issues, and it’s hard for me to decide whether they are because of the relationship or just because our circumstances are hard (he doesn’t speak English, I don’t speak Turkish, time zones, he works long hours at sea etc) 

I have had moments of trust issues for many reasons. One being that he is extremely good looking. It was hard for me to believe that someone who is that attractive, cannot easily find a girlfriend where he is. It makes me question his intentions with me. However, this has been sort of remedied, as I messaged one of his girl mates who he had posted that he went out for coffee with. He told me they were friends since childhood, and she confirmed this to me, and mentioned how he talked about me when they went out for coffee. 

I have spoken to her further as we have become friends, and everything he tells me seems to line up. I genuinely do not think he is cheating. 

However, I can see that he follows lots of other foreign girls on instagram and likes their posts. I have brought this up with him numerous times, and he says he just likes the posts as they are cool. 

There is also the fact that he only communicates when it works for him. This is to be expected, but it feels like everything is on his terms. If u raise issues, he sort of brushes them off and makes jokes. I take it as disrespectful, but as I am a woman, maybe it is a cultural thing. 

I want to emphasise that there are lots of good aspects. We have a lot of chemistry, make each other laugh, and share similar goals for the future. Even though we don’t speak the same language, we use google translate and it works well for the most part. We have our own sort of sign language for things on video call. 
I am extremely attracted to him, and it seems to be mutual. 
I haven’t felt so strongly in a long time, but sometimes I worry that it is just loneliness, and feeling the need to fill a void somehow. 

When I was with him in Turkey, we went clubbing with his cousins and I got on with them well. I had to meet all of his friends, which was nice, but also exhausting. It was clear he was trying to show me off. I am not sure whether that is a good or bad thing..

I just want any kind of advice on this situation. I feel I can be a bit too trusting and naïve. But it’s been nearly 9 months of long distance now, and there seems to be a clear commitment by both of us in that respect.

Out of nowhere, I noticed this black, oval-shaped object moving across the sky. At first, I thought, “Eh, probably a bird,” but it was way too high up. And the weird part? No wings. No flapping. It was just gliding smoothly in a straight line.  
  
Then I thought maybe it was a balloon, but the wind was really strong today, and balloons usually wobble or drift around this thing didn’t. It just kept going steady, same speed, same direction.  
  
I actually considered running inside to grab my phone, but I was scared I’d lose sight of it. So I just stood there, watching until it disappeared into the distance. No noise, no lights, no streak lines that are seen when rockets are in the sky, nothing reflective just a solid black oval moving like it had somewhere to be.  
  
Now I can’t stop thinking about it. The more I replay it in my head, the less it feels like something “normal.” I don’t want to sound dramatic, but it honestly felt like I might’ve just seen a UFO.

I’m looking for a long term romantic relationship with kisses and cuddles, but never anything more intimate. And I mean ***never***. If you need a more physical relationship, I’m not the right person for you. Let’s be respectful :)

**Who I’m looking for:**

* someone who’s around my age, so 25-30
* located somewhere in Europe
* since I’m ace, someone with a very low drive, or maybe you’re ace too
* someone who wants to eventually settle down, but doesn’t want kids
* emotional intelligence, honesty, reliability and stability are desired

**Who I am:**

* 27 years old (1998)
* born and raised in Finland
* atheist and a progressive person with liberal views (leftie, feminist, pro-choice, ally…)
* childfree
* chubby and short (160cm), some small tattoos but I dream of a full sleeve
* short dark brown hair (but I change it up, it’s been green, blue, purple…)
* don’t smoke or drink at all
* city girl, love the buzz of big cities, culture, museums, coffee shops, shopping etc.
* also enjoy a quiet evening at home
* into fashion, photography, k-pop, anime, writing, reading, traveling
* sports or gaming are not really my thing lol
* dog person but sadly allergic :(

**Dealbreakers**/ **Big** **NOs for me:**

* far right ideology/views
* racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, bigotry in general
* drugs, smoking, drinking a lot
* severe mental health problems (no ill meaning, I’m just a sensitive person who often carries other people’s troubles way too much, and it can get too heavy)

**NOTE:** Please do not message me saying “you just haven’t met the right person” or thinking you can change or “fix” me. I’m not ill, I’m not broken, I’m not faulty. I was born this way and I’m happy. Go find a partner that meets your needs and stop trying to change others.",2,1756045845.0,r4r,1,0.62,False

Is anyone else realizing how insanely EASY it is to get PAID for just testing out new app features these days?! 🤯

I just stumbled into this digital goldmine in 2025, and TBH my jaw keeps dropping. No surveys, no spammy nonsense—just real apps and serious payouts! I got cash for playing with features that haven’t even launched yet. Pour yourself a cold drink because I’m about to spill the top 7 LEGIT apps that *actually* put $$$ in your account for testing the future before it even drops.

Ready? Let’s GO!

---

### 1. **GoodNovel TestApp**  
You WON’T believe this until you try it. **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** pays for sneak-peeking new story features (think interactive chapters and secret events). I made quick money RIGHT after signing up. Not only did I get paid, but I also got to influence what millions read next. Um, hello?! That’s ICONIC.  
Remember: Try **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** today or you’ll totally regret not getting in early.

---

### 2. PlayLab Alpha  
Okay, this is wild! Test fresh game features BEFORE they go public. I literally had to keep quiet so my friends wouldn’t beg for beta access! They pay via PayPal or instant gift cards if you send real feedback, even weird bug reports. Bonus: Some features are for MAJOR games you already play!

---

### 3. ClickNTest  
This Chrome extension is such a hack. You sign up, enable it, use your browser, and—BOOM—you’re testing whatever’s hot and buggy. It flashed me cash halfway through a 10-minute session. No lie. Try lurking on tech forums too: these guys are EVERYWHERE.

---

### 4. BetaBounty  
Ever wanted to be a *real* product designer? This platform lets you test upcoming social features (from anonymous Q&A to wild new group chats) before anyone else. Payments hit hard and fast—Venmo, PayPal, even crypto!

---

### 5. **GoodNovel TestApp**  
Yes, again! Because **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** keeps adding new feature batches every month, and the rewards just STACK! I have friends who literally cover their weekly coffee bill just from this app.  
Don’t sleep: Back to **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** and grab those new release invites.

---

### 6. RewardRush  
A mix of games, shopping, music, and even AI tools. Every time you test something, coins drop into your account. And—plot twist—they offer surprise power-ups for completing multiple tasks in an hour! Who knew getting paid to “beta” could feel like a game in itself?

---

### 7. **GoodNovel TestApp** AGAIN  
Yep, the one at **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** is so viral, you can’t afford to ignore it. I got paid three times last month for three totally different features. Some of my followers DM’d me their receipts and I'm honestly shook about how FAST the payments hit.  
Why haven’t you clicked **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** yet?! (Seriously, try it!)

---

Honestly, it’s never been easier, faster, or more fun to get a DRIP of side-cash—just for messing with new tech features. No catch—just click, test, get paid.

Anyone else already stacking their digital coin? Drop your experiences or questions because I need to see if everyone’s as hyped as me! 👀🚀

1myx1or,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trendinfo/comments/1myx1or/when_a_medical_brace_becomes_the_hottest_musthave/,When a Medical Brace Becomes the Hottest “Must-Have” Item—Are We Buying Products or Alternate Versions of Ourselves?,"Okay so I have to ask—how do people even decide what counts as a “hot product” anymore?  

Like, I’m scrolling through pages and pages of things that all scream at me with bold red SALE banners, and sometimes it feels like marketing is controlling my brain cells. But then, out of nowhere, one item pops up, and my reaction isn’t just “oh maybe” but more like “wait, do I secretly *need* this in my life??”  

The one that’s been messing with my head recently... is a brace. Yes, a literal *brace*. Not sneakers, not headphones, not coffee gear. A medical-looking ankle brace that, somehow, is trending. And here’s the part that breaks my brain—I think I might actually get one, even though I don’t technically have a fracture. Is that weird? (Be honest.)  

Here’s the highlight:  

- **Top On Sale Product Recommendations!**  
  Ankle Fracture Fixation, Night Use, Daily Walking Brace, Foot Drop Fracture Fixation Support and Fixator  
  **Price Now:** USD 48.79 (Original price: USD 57.40, 15% off)  
  🔗 [Click & Buy](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ompIzT7)  

I started spiraling a little on why this brace feels like a hot product:  

- It’s practical, and practicality is quietly sexy when everything else is “just vibes.”  
- Night use + daily walking? It’s giving dual-utility, all-purpose gadget vibes. Almost like the Swiss Army knife of leg stability.  
- It’s discounted. And let’s admit it—we all trick ourselves into believing every percentage saved is basically free money in the bank.  

But here’s my confusion. Why do we elevate something like this from simply “a useful brace” into a “must-watch product”?  
Is it because:  

- People are suddenly obsessed with wellness accessories?  
- There’s an underground fascination with gear that looks oddly futuristic, like you could wear it and suddenly move like a robot surgeon in an anime?  
- Or maybe it’s just the weird satisfaction of owning something designed with specificity—like, it was made for one exact scenario and yet it makes you feel like a prepared human being in *all* scenarios?  

I swear, part of me wants to buy it just to sit in my room and know I *could* secure an ankle fracture like a professional, even if my current hardship is only walking too long at the farmer’s market.  

This honestly bends my brain: Are ""hot products"" hot because they solve real problems… or because they unlock a secret sense of *potential future self*? The version of you who’s put together, ready to handle anything, even a random late-night sprain.  

So I’ll leave it at this:  
Sometimes what’s trending isn’t just cool tech or flashy style pieces. Sometimes, weirdly enough, it’s a medical brace quietly whispering, “Hey... I’ll take care of you.”  

Anyone else ever get confused by the stuff that becomes a “hot product”? Or am I simply losing grasp of all logical consumer reasoning and this is the new normal?",1,1756045735.0,Trendinfo,0,1.0,False

Just a guy who misses and looking for a girl that is fine with a casual intimacy. A girl who misses being touch, getting dominated, and getting babied in bed. A someone fine with being casual and not ready to commit in relationship. 

A someone that is not too aggressive, just a normal or soft girl that wants to be submissive. A girl that is open for giving blowjobs and hanjobs.

I'm open for inexperienced girls that wants to try getting eaten, fingers, or getting a dick inside you.

It could be a one time thing or a long term casual intimacy. Pero it's much nicer if it's long term.

1mywspj,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1mywspj/question_regarding_maintenance_on_keto/,Question regarding maintenance on Keto,"I'v been doing a Keto diet for about a year now, and I'm down from 230 to 190. When I started this journey, I was aiming for 215, which I never thought I'd reach, and I cruised past that milestone quickly. I have now been at 190 for about 6 months and I don't want to lose any more. It has been an adjustment for some of my friends and family, as they seem shocked at how different I look, but I have never felt better and I'm close to 50. I should also mention that I did the Atkins diet back in 2003 and lost 68 lbs in a year, so my body seems to really favor this kind of eating.

I have never really tracked anything, I just eat close to the same thing everyday.

Can I have some input on what I currently eat?   I should also note that I do get about 8000 steps per day on a slow day, and around 12-13000 on a busy day, as I walk alot for my job.

**Breakfast** 3 egg chaffle with 1/8-1/4 cup of cheese, almond flour, cinnamon+ 1/2 cup of sugar free yogurt on top and about 10 blueberries

Coffee with a little butter and heavy cream

**Lunch-** Sometimes my smallest meal, as the chaffle seems to keep me full for several hours. I sometimes do a protein bowl from qdoba without beans and rice, but this is rare.

Some days, I'll have a tin of sardines plus an avocado, and other days I'll do 1/2 cup of cottage cheese+ pork rinds and some salami and cheese rolls. This keeps me full until around 5-6 PM

**Dinner-** either a chicken breast, piece of salmon, beef burger, salmon patties, or some type of meat + green beans and/or brussel sprouts with butter and salt. I usually use better to cook this meat

Snack- ( I can't kick this habit) I usually have about 1/8-1/4 cup of salted peanuts in t he evening, as I am not concerned about being in ketosis, as I'm no longer trying to lose weight.

I have very little craving  for sweets, and have had one ice cream sundae in a year, and a few mini candy bars here and there, but never more than one to two per week.

**Any idea on whether or not this is a good maintenance diet?**

It seems to have kept me right at 190 for many months. I figured that my peanut intake would cause weight gain...but am I at enough of a calorie deficit that it no longer matters?  My cholesterol (HDL is as good as it's ever been and my other numbers are pretty good. I told my Dr. about the diet at my last appointment and he encouraged it as he said he puts his diabetic patients on the keto diet. My A1c has dropped from 5.7- 5.1.

Just looking for any inout and/or advice on my current plan.",1,1756045119.0,keto,1,1.0,False

1mywozk,https://www.reddit.com/r/hysterectomy/comments/1mywozk/am_i_depressed/,Am I Depressed?,"TW: Suicidal ideation and self-harm 

I have a long history of mental illness, and I'm 5 wpo from a hysterectomy with saplingo-oopherectomy for PMDD. I started HRT the day after surgery. I knew I was high-risk for going into a depression after surgery, but what I'm experiencing is so different from what I used to experience that I'm not sure if it's depression or just post-op surgical fatigue. 

I used to struggle with daily suicidal thoughts, and those three days before my period every month were an exercise in keeping myself alive and avoiding flying into a deranged fury at my partner. Sometimes I failed and became irrationally angry. Sometimes I self-harmed. Being alive hurt so badly, I just wanted to rip myself apart every moment. I tried every birth control, every SSRI, TMS, two decades of therapy, etc. 

And now I feel... calm, but listless. I don't want to hurt myself, I'm just tired and kind of indifferent. All I want to do is drink coffee and lay on the couch watching *Star Trek.* Pet the dog. Maybe knit a little if I feel really ambitious. I have all these creative projects and a YouTube gig that's starting to look like it could become a career, and I'm struggling to motivate myself to work on anything, even time-sensitive things. Part of me thinks something must be wrong because I have so many opportunities and options and a partner who actually teared up in couples therapy last week when I pointed out that the day I defused a disagreement between us was the day I would have been in my crazy PMDD headspace before the surgery--all that good stuff and I still don't want to do anything, and part of me thinks that maybe this is what life is like for people who aren't chemically imbalanced? I don't know. This steady calm is so strange; is it just that I don't know how to function like this?

Thoughts? I'm seeing my gynecologist for a check on Tuesday and have a strong mental health support system, so I'll bring it up with them, I just wondered if other people had experienced anything like this. ",3,1756044873.0,hysterectomy,4,1.0,False
