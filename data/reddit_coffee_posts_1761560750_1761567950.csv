I’m 29M, recently moved to Bengaluru—left my comfort zone for better opportunities (and let’s be honest, good money).

Since I work remotely most days, my social life currently involves talking to my laptop. So I’m hoping to meet folks who also want to get out, explore the city, try new things, or just share some laughs.

I’m into biking, trekking, solo travel, swimming, running, skating, movies, and any kind of fun chaos. I hit the gym when motivation (or testosterone 😄) kicks in, and yes, I do party—though my dance moves look like a confused robot.

Also open to dating (female only) if the vibe clicks. Don’t worry, I’m decent, respectful, and apparently “good-looking” (my ex might back me up).

If you’re bored, adventurous, or just want to grab a coffee and talk nonsense—say hi or drop a DM. Promise I reply faster than most customer support teams 😅",1,1761567849.0,u_Sad_Seaworthiness882,0,1.0,False

1ohcwk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceTalks/comments/1ohcwk1/the_1400yearold_chinese_money_rule_that_can_help/,The 1400-year-old Chinese money rule that can help you save your first $10K,"There’s an ancient money rule that’s been quietly passed down for over 1400 years, and the crazy part is that it still works better than most modern budgeting apps.

It’s called the Four-Column Accounting Method, and it originated during China’s Tang Dynasty. Despite being ancient, it’s surprisingly simple, and powerful enough to help you save your first (or next) $10,000.

**What Is the Four-Column Method?**

It’s exactly what it sounds like, you track your money in four columns each month:

1. Beginning Balance — How much you have at the start of the month.
2. Increases — All income (salary, side hustles, investments, etc.).
3. Decreases — Every expense you make.
4. Ending Balance — What’s left after subtracting your decreases from your total.

That’s it. No fancy software, no complex categories — just pure, honest tracking.  
And that honesty is what makes it work. You can’t hide from your spending when it’s right there in front of you.

**Example**

Let’s say you start the month with **$8,000** in your account.  
You earn **$6,120** (salary + side hustles + dividends),  
and your expenses total **$6,470** (rent, food, transport, loans, etc.).

Your ending balance? **$7,650.**

You’ve actually spent more than you made — and you can *see* it.

That visibility forces accountability. You immediately spot where you’re overspending and can make adjustments for the next month.

**Why This Method Still Works**

It’s not just about math — it’s about behavior. Ancient Chinese money culture emphasized a few timeless principles that make this system effective even today:

* Frugality & self-discipline — Save first, spend later.
* Long-term thinking — Focus on security, not short-term pleasure.
* Family responsibility — Planning ahead and saving for others.
* Education & value-based spending — Spend on things that grow in value (skills, health, assets), not just status symbols.

These aren’t just cultural ideas — they’re habits that quietly build wealth.

**How You Can Use It**

You don’t need to start on the 1st of the month.

Start today. Open a spreadsheet or notebook and make four columns.

Add your numbers for the month so far — or even better, look back at the last three months using your bank or credit card statements.

Yes, it takes effort. But after doing it once, you’ll have a crystal-clear picture of your real financial habits, the good, the bad, and the “I can’t believe I spent that much on coffee.”

If you want to make this ancient rule actually work in modern life, try to adopt these three behaviors:

1. Stay humble – Don’t fall into the trap of showing off your money. Contentment is underrated wealth.
2. Live below your means – Aim to save 30–50% if you can. Even 20% consistently beats most people.
3. Spend based on value – Ask: “Does this purchase genuinely add value to my life?”

The Four-Column Method is old, but that’s why it’s powerful,  it’s built on simplicity, awareness, and self-control. Sometimes the best “new” money strategy is one that’s been around for over a millennium.",1,1761567700.0,PersonalFinanceTalks,0,1.0,False

1ohcuzh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ohcuzh,An Evening in Kolkata (Rate My Brief Visit to Your Quaint City),"I was in Kolkata this weekend for an exam. Knowing that I was all set to tank up the exam, I had no intentions of studying but didn’t know what else to do either.

Reached Howrah Junction around 2:00 p.m. I had booked a dormitory, checked in, and after not being able to take a nap due to the scorching heat, decided to go out. Did some Googling for a while and made a rough itinerary.

Got out of the dormitory around 4:15 p.m. and walked to Jagannath Ghat. Not being able to reach the other side of the bridge due to heavy traffic, I walked upstream on the wrong side of the footpath and went through a flower market that turned into a dark alley towards the end — but fortunately, it did lead me to the ghat. I reached just in time to witness the sunset. It was peaceful, with very few people around at that hour. I watched the sun set behind the Howrah Bridge, and as the bridge lit up, I started towards the only place I truly wanted to visit in the city — The Indian Coffee House. After swimming through a sea of traffic, I finally reached the destination. For me, the very idea that people can just be at a place and hang out where legends like Tagore, Bose, and Ray once had their addas is pretty fascinating. Of course, I found a lot of crowd there — something that I had grown familiar with by then. Fortunately, I managed to get a table upstairs. I ordered my coffee and a chicken cutlet and soaked in the vibe as I waited for my order. The coffee was great. After that, I wanted to explore the bookshops of College Street. I eventually picked up a small souvenir for myself — The Royal Bengal Mystery by Ray (which I read on the train during my return journey) — along with a couple of other books for ₹200 (I know the bargain could have been better, but never mind). After that, I wanted to have some mishti doi, so I just Googled “sweet shops near me,” which led me to a shop called Putiram Sweets. I don’t know if it’s considered a good shop or not, but the mishti doi was a little too mishti for my taste buds. 😃

That’s it — that was my evening. Came back to the dormitory, tanked the exam the next morning, and returned to my city.

So, was this a good visit ?

My wife and I are heading to New Zealand this November for our first wedding anniversary. It’s roughly a 20-day trip covering both the North and South Islands.

Both of us like to take it easy - not ticking every box, just enjoying the place, and the vibe. So our plan is a mix of relaxing days + a few key experiences.

Our main bases are Mount Maunganui and Queenstown, and we’ve splurged a little on nice Airbnbs to make sure we can truly unwind. We know we’ll be skipping a few “must-do” places in NZ, but we’d rather come back refreshed than exhausted.

Would really appreciate it if you could take a look and let us know if this itinerary makes sense, and if there’s anything nearby we should definitely not miss. (We’ve already booked most of our stays, so suggestions near Mount Maunganui and Queenstown would be the most useful!)

Itinerary

Nov 14-15: Auckland

Landing in Auckland in the morning, staying for about a day and a half.

Plan: Art galleries, Sky Tower, Commercial Bay, and Devonport.

Haven’t researched Auckland much, so open to any “easy to do in a day” ideas - food spots, hidden gems, walkable areas, etc.

Nov 17–21: Mount Maunganui

Plan: enjoy the beaches, walk up the Mount, do a couple of hikes, and take it slow.

One day trip to Rotorua - especially to see Whakarewarewa Village.

Heard traffic in Tauranga can get bad… but we’re from India, so we’ve probably seen worse.

Nov 22–24: Tongariro + Taupo

Doing the Tongariro Alpine Crossing on the 23rd.

Heading to Taupo on the 24th to chill for a day before flying to Queenstown on the 25th.

Looking for relaxing stuff in Taupo — lakeside walks, cozy cafés, or anything easygoing.

Nov 25–Dec 2: Queenstown + Around

Exploring Queenstown, plus day trips to Arrowtown, Glenorchy, Wanaka, Central Otago, and Gibbston Valley. Really excited for this part of the trip.

Also have an overnight trip to Mount Cook and Lake Tekapo.

Open to any extra suggestions. Anything we shouldn’t miss in Queenstown?

Dec 3: Flying back home.

---

Bonus Idea

We’d love to do a motorbike day trip - ideally around Mount Maunganui or Queenstown.
Is that realistic? Any routes you’d recommend?

---

What We’d Love Suggestions On

Hidden gems/short day trips near Maunganui or Queenstown.

Great local food, coffee, or craft beer spots, and everything else. Easy nature walks, hikes, gardens, or fun local experiences, anything that might not find on the internet.

Welcome… to Moonside!

Ness drinks the coffee, and finds himself in a spooky inversion of the big city of Fourside. Dodging monsters and wacky townspeople alike, Ness frantically heads closer and closer to the demon statue. Meanwhile, poor Jeff is still stuck in the real world, and it’s up to him to keep Ness’s body safe while his friend’s consciousness wanders around the neon nightmare world. And that’s a tall order in itself, what with Ness stumbling into heavy traffic, a security system full of deadly robots, and ugh, PORKY!!!

Will Jeff save the day at the top of the Monotoli building? Will Ness ever find a man in a Hawaiian t-shirt drinking a Mai-Tai who can successfully teleport him to a man with a unibrow and a gold tooth so he can get in before the melting Dali clocks make him take the math test again and again for the rest of his life? Will, uh… will that last one make a little more sense in context?

We had an amazing connection, but kept it friendly (except some flirting) all 6 times (long and intense meetings) we met, my attraction grew for him during this time but I liked the lack of pressure from meeting in a friendly way and exploring organically.  It was about a 50/50 split in terms of initiating plans, maybe slightly more from my side.

Then the end of the 6th time he kissed me, and I was glad we waited that long.  It was cute and natural and he said how happy he was to have met me.   I returned the feeling.

One thing I noticed is he doesnt seem to be a planner, at all, more a go with the flow type.  He asked me to meet last minute a few days after we kissed, but it didn’t work out from his side and then I got sick.  Then both of us were very busy the next 5 days (although I would have been up to fit in even a brief coffee since he was going away) before he had to go on a week long work trip that he just returned from a few days ago.

Nothing is in the diary.  Yet he enthusiastically talks to me most days.  I don’t want to be the one to initiate right now, as I’m trying to understand if he’s interested or not.  He talks like he is, our connection is wonderful, but without the action of seeing eachother in person I’m left uncertain and tbh quite anxious since we haven’t met since we kissed now almost 3 weeks ago.

She gave me a kiss on the cheek.

Anyways next day I found the DJ's instagram (she followed my friend) and I added her. She was even more gorgeous than I remembered. She added me back. Now I messaged her that it was nice meeting her, congratulating her on her great set, and that I'd love to get a drink or a coffee if she's up for it. And she's left me on read.

1ohcobb,https://youtu.be/6LSKGAEATIw,4 Very Scary TRUE Neighbors from Hell Horror Stories,"# ""Unseen Threats"":

We had called Helper home for most of our married life, my husband Max and I. The little mining town in Utah felt like a safe pocket of the world, with its rows of old houses and neighbors who waved from their porches. Max worked the coal mines until retirement, and we raised our kids there, watching them grow up and move on. By 2019, Max was eighty-five, doing his best with the memory lapses that dementia brings and managing his diabetes. I was seventy-nine, still handling our day-to-day life.

Our neighbor was a man named Rikhard. Early seventies, ex-military like Max, though that was where any common ground ended. At first he seemed like the quiet type. Kept to himself. Harmless. That was what we believed.

It started small. His yard began to fill with junk. Tires stacked like ugly totems. Rusted car parts. Bags of garbage that never seemed tied shut. When the wind blew, the sour smell carried right to our porch.

“Jean, look at that mess,” Max muttered, staring out the window one afternoon. “Soon it’ll be in our yard.”

I tried to reason with our neighbor. “Rikhard, could you clean up a little? The trash is blowing onto our side.”

He glared from his doorway. “Mind your own business. My property.”

Max brushed it off. “Leave him be. He’s not hurting anyone.”

He was wrong.

Soon he shoved his mailbox onto our shared stand without asking, pushing ours aside like we didn’t exist. Max fixed it. Rikhard moved it again. The message was clear. He wanted control. Our peace began to shrink.

Then came the fire. One night his house went up in flames—faulty wiring, the firefighters said. Any other person would have moved somewhere safe. Rikhard stayed. Lived inside the charred shell with no power, no water, no working toilet.

The smell turned unbearable, like sewage mixed with burnt plastic. Flies and bugs spilled into our yard. We would catch him staring at our house from the blackened windows, unmoving, watching.

“He’s at it again,” I whispered.  
Max waved through the window. Rikhard didn’t blink.

His anger crept toward our family. When our grandkids visited, he screamed at them for stepping near his fence.

“Get off my land!” he’d yell, face twisted with rage.

Our granddaughter Amy came inside crying. “He threatened us, Grandma.”

I told her to stay away. Max tried to talk neighbor to neighbor. He returned shaken, and I saw fear in his eyes for the first time.

Nights brought scraping sounds along the fence. Shadows dragging things in his yard. The kind of noises that keep you awake long after they stop.

By summer, he hung signs on his fence. “Trespassers Will Be Dealt With.” He pushed more trash toward us. I couldn’t even hang laundry without gagging.

“We can’t live like this,” I told Max.

We called the city. They shrugged it off. Civil matter.

Somehow Rikhard found out. That evening he pounded on our door.

“You reported me!” he screamed.

Max cracked it open. “We just want clean air.”

“You’ll regret this,” he growled. “I’ll make your life miserable.”

Items went missing from our yard. Tools. Flowerpots. We’d find them broken in his trash pile. Max’s patience thinned. I begged him not to confront the man alone.

The fear became routine. Rikhard followed Max to the store, walking just far enough behind to deny it. Whispering threats. Our phone rang at strange hours. Silence on the other end.

Max’s health was slipping, dementia nipping pieces of him away every week. I watched him try to stay strong, but we were living in dread.

Then came October seventeenth.

Max noticed Rikhard’s mailbox tipping again. “Going to fix it before it falls,” he said, steadying himself with his cane. He set the mailbox on Rikhard’s porch and came back inside. My stomach was tight with worry.

Minutes later, Rikhard charged over.

“You touched my mail?” he shrieked.

Max stepped outside. “It was falling. I helped.”

I hurried to join him, heart pounding. “Rikhard, please calm down.”

He shoved me hard. Pain shot through my knee as I hit the fence. Before I could stand, he was on Max.

He drove his fists into Max’s chest. Kicked his legs out from under him.

“You old fool!”

Max crumpled, gasping. I screamed, trying to pull him off.

Then the kick. Straight to Max’s groin. Max’s face went white with agony.

“That’s what you get,” Rikhard said, walking home like he had only swatted a fly.

Amy showed up minutes later and took charge. Police came. They questioned him. He admitted the attack without blinking. Claimed we started it.

Max’s bruises spread dark and fast. The next day he couldn't form sentences. “Jean… my head…”

Doctors found the blood clot. Trauma-induced. Preventable.

Machines breathed around him while I held his hand and begged him to stay.

On October twenty-fifth, I lost him.

The medical examiner called it homicide. Police upgraded the charges. For a moment, I thought we would see justice.

At trial, his lawyer twisted everything. They blamed Max’s age. His dementia. His diabetes. Said the fight wasn’t the cause.

The jury believed them.

Not guilty on homicide. Time served on the assaults. He walked free.

I stared at our lawyer, stunned. “How can that be?”

“They bought his story.”

Rikhard kept threatening Amy afterward. Another charge. Still no jail. He lived right next door, living his life while mine had been shattered.

I sold the house where we built fifty years of memories. Moved in with family. The home that once felt safe now only reminded me of fear and loss.

Rikhard died a few months later, January 2022. Brain disease. The same body part he used to terrorize my husband is what failed him in the end.

People talk about crime scenes and courtrooms, but the real horror was living beside that man day after day. Ordinary life turning into a slow nightmare. Never knowing when the next threat would become the blow that finally took something precious away.





# ""No One Home"":

I had just turned 28 when I packed up what was left of my life and drove away from the city. My ex had burned through half our savings on the way out and left me in a fog of resentment. I wanted distance from everything familiar. The little suburb I found looked harmless enough. Quiet streets, trimmed lawns, families who gave polite waves before hurrying back indoors. No one prying. Exactly what I thought I needed.

The house I bought was small but had a huge yard with fences tall enough to feel safe. I worked as a graphic designer from home, so most of my days were spent inside staring at screens, convincing myself I was building something new.

The place next door, though, didn’t fit the neighborhood. A full-on mansion with stone walls and curtains sealed tight against the world. Too big. Too private. I kept wondering who would choose an area like this for a house like that.

On my second day, I forced myself to go door to door, introduce myself. Most neighbors smiled quickly and retreated like I’d interrupted something they didn’t want me to see. When I tried the mansion, a guy about my age answered. He had a messy mullet, a jaw that looked clenched even when he smiled.

“Hey, man,” he said and stuck out a hand. “I’m Damon. You the new guy?”

“Alex,” I said, and his handshake was firm enough but his eyes kept flicking past me to the street.

We talked for a few minutes. He joked that he was the only person under 40 for blocks. He pointed out the good Thai place. When I asked what he did, his smile slipped for a moment.

“Finance.” One word, barely formed. Then a quick add-on. “Inherited this place. Family thing.”

He lived alone, which made no sense for the size of the house, but I pretended not to notice. I invited him over for a beer sometime. He nodded. “Text me.”

We exchanged numbers. I walked home thinking maybe I got lucky with at least one friendly neighbor.

Weeks passed and Damon stayed invisible. His black sedan never moved. No grocery bags, no footsteps on the porch, no one stopping by. I texted him a couple times to hang out. He always had a reason to say no. Eventually I stopped reaching out.

Then came that night.

A sudden blast of bass shook me awake at 2 a.m. Voices—shouting, laughing, like a packed house party. It was a Wednesday. My window was cracked open. I could see lights strobing through Damon’s curtains and at least seven cars jammed into the driveway.

I threw on a hoodie and crossed the grass. The music was even louder up close, the kind of noise that should wake the whole street. I pounded on the door. Nothing. I pounded again, harder. Still silence from the other side.

I tried the handle. It turned.

“Damon?” I called.

The foyer was dimly lit. A dozen pairs of shoes sat by the door—heels, boots, sneakers. As if a party had started and everyone just vanished in the middle of it. The living room was empty. No glasses, no spilled drinks, only the pulsing sound of some faceless crowd coming from hidden speakers.

Something in me said leave, but curiosity shoved me forward. The kitchen looked staged. No dishes. No food. Like a model home that no one lived in.

Then I saw a half-open door. A faint industrial glow leaked from a basement below. A grinding noise, mechanical and slow, pushed under the music. A sharp chemical smell curled up the stairs and burned my eyes.

My pulse spiked.

I crouched and peeked through the crack.

Three older men stood on a concrete floor wearing heavy overalls, thick gloves, goggles. They faced something just out of view. One of them wiped his brow with the back of his sleeve. Their mouths moved but their voices were swallowed by the canned party noise overhead.

I backed up, slow as I could.

The lights above flickered and dimmed, like someone had shut a door somewhere deeper in the house.

Every instinct I had finally kicked in.

I ran.

Out the front. Across the yard. Over my fence. Inside. Locked everything. Turned off the lights and hid behind the blinds gasping for air.

Minutes later, eight men poured from Damon’s front door. All older, rough-looking. They scanned the street. One pointed toward my house. Another snapped something and shoved his hand away. Then they filed into the cars and rolled off, headlights dark until they reached the road. The music cut mid-beat.

Damon wasn’t with them.

The rest of the night I sat in my office chair shaking, trying to convince myself it wasn’t what it looked like. I pictured dialing 911, trying to explain that I trespassed and saw a weird basement scene with bleach smells and industrial noise. No screams, no blood. Just wrong.

The shoes bothered me the most. A whole party’s worth of shoes and no people.

The next morning, the street was calm. Birds. Sprinklers. I asked two neighbors casually if they heard a party. Both said no. Mrs. Larson looked genuinely confused. Mr. Patel joked he slept too hard to notice anything.

Either they were lying, or something prevented the sound from traveling past the fence line.

Damon’s car never moved again. Weeks passed. Grass grew wild. Mail stacked up.

A “For Sale” sign went up.

His sedan disappeared the same night.

I searched his name online until my eyes hurt. Nothing. Then I found a news article from a town a couple hours away. A finance worker gone missing after inheriting property. Suspected foul play. Same face. Different last name.

Cold dread settled into my bones.

Those men. The bleach. The grinding. The shoes like props. The fake party noise.

What were they covering?

Months later, the house sold to a cheerful couple with kids. They gutted the basement. Rumors spread that workers found odd stains. Nothing anyone could prove.

Life pretended to go back to normal. Mine didn’t.

I still sleep with every lock checked twice. Sometimes I spot a shape where the yard meets the fence and tell myself it is only shadows. I do not look too long.

I do not knock on neighbors’ doors anymore.

Friendly small talk means nothing. You never know what is sealed behind someone else’s walls. Once you open the wrong door and see something you shouldn’t, you carry the truth alone.

You learn that safety is often just a story you tell yourself to get through the night.





# ""Our Yard, His War"":

I had just stacked the last empty box in the garage when the man next door walked over to introduce himself. My wife, Lisa, and I had spent years saving for this place in Altadena. Good schools, quiet streets, and a yard big enough for the kids to run wild. Our son was thirteen, trying hard to look older than he was, and our daughter had just turned eight and still believed the world was mostly kind.

The neighborhood seemed to agree with her. Neat hedges, friendly waves, kids on scooters. Then there was Jack.

He appeared at the property line with a firm handshake and a smile that never reached his eyes. He said he was a police officer and welcomed us to the street, though he spoke while scanning our yard like he was searching for evidence. I brushed it off. Cops are trained to notice things.

A couple of weeks later, a note was taped to the fence we shared. “Your fence is three inches over my line. Move it or there will be issues.” Lisa laughed at it. “Probably a misunderstanding.” I wanted to believe that, so we ignored it.

The next evening, Jack knocked. Uniform on. Arms folded.

“I measured it myself,” he said. “It’s over.”

I showed him the original survey from the sale. I even suggested a professional measurement so everything stayed friendly. He agreed, then walked away stiffly, jaw set.

The surveyor confirmed what we already knew: the fence was correct. Jack didn’t congratulate us or even acknowledge it. Instead, he filed a complaint with the city. We spent months in small claims court. The judge ruled in our favor. Jack had to pay us a couple thousand for the trouble.

We bought pizza to celebrate. I remember feeling proud that we handled it well.

That pride lasted a week.

Early Saturday morning, a leaf blower roared like a chainsaw. I looked outside and saw Jack blasting piles of leaves from his yard over the fence into ours. When I stepped outside, he turned the blower toward my face, dust and grit stinging my skin.

“My leaves, my choice,” he said.

Lisa told me to let it go. At first, I tried.

It didn’t stop. It evolved.

Slurs about my background yelled over the fence. False accusations that our son stole from his yard. Middle fingers aimed at my daughter when she rode her bike. She stopped going outside. My son started peeking around curtains before stepping onto the patio.

I filed a police report. The response felt like a shrug. He was one of their own.

Eggs hit our front door late one night. Yolk dripping down as I scrubbed, Lisa watching from inside. She whispered, “What if he doesn’t stop?”

I installed security cameras. Within days, cigarette butts littered our driveway. Then a rock shattered our living room window at 2 a.m. The camera caught a shape that walked like Jack. Police said it wasn’t clear enough.

The fear began to seep into everything. We avoided the backyard. We whispered more. Our home didn’t feel like a home.

The moment everything changed happened on a sunny afternoon. I was fixing the sprinkler when Jack stormed toward me. He didn’t speak, just raised a canister and sprayed. My vision exploded in pain. Pepper spray. I dropped to my knees choking. Lisa screamed. He walked away like he was watering his plants.

This time, internal affairs got involved. They discovered other complaints. He was fired.

Losing the badge didn’t calm him. It hardened him.

Scratches across our car. Trash dumped into our bins. Brown patches on the lawn where something toxic had soaked into the soil. The restraining orders multiplied like paperwork only lawyers appreciate.

Every knock on the door made my heart jump. Every creak in the night sent me checking the camera feed. Lisa stopped sleeping. She kept the kids close, as if distance alone could keep them safe.

Then one morning I noticed a for-sale sign staked into his lawn. Weeks later, a moving truck arrived. Jack loaded boxes, slammed the truck doors shut, and drove off without a single look in our direction.

Relief came slowly. The grass grew back. The new neighbors smiled for real. The kids laughed in the yard again.

Still, sometimes the wind rattles the fence and I feel my chest tighten. I look at the camera screens glowing on the wall and remember what it felt like to be trapped in the place meant to protect us.

You never truly know the person living just beyond the fence.





# ""My Stalker"":

I moved into my new flat in Buckinghamshire in 2021, proud and excited to finally have some independence at 24. My partner and I split the rent, and it felt like the start of real adulthood. The building had only a handful of tenants and an easy quiet that felt safe. The guy upstairs, Ben Ayre, introduced himself once in the hallway. A quick hello, a shy smile. He seemed forgettably ordinary, the kind of neighbor you never think about twice.

The first messages felt harmless enough. An unknown number lit up my phone.  
“Hey, it’s Ben from upstairs. Saw you coming in earlier. Want to grab a coffee sometime?”  
I ignored it. People ask neighbors out. It happens.

Then another message.  
“Didn’t get my text? Let’s hang out.”

After a few days, the tone changed.  
“You look nice today.”  
That one made my stomach tighten. I replayed my walk home. What was I wearing? How close had he been watching?

The knocks came next. Not loud. Just firm. Persistent. Evening dinner interrupted by a sudden rap on the door. Through the peephole, I’d see him staring straight at it, shifting from one foot to the other like he expected me to welcome him in.  
“Jess, I know you’re in there,” he’d call out, voice thick with entitlement.

I thought silence would send a message. It only emboldened him.

Every day, like clockwork, the knocks returned. My partner and I started whispering inside our own home, afraid any sound would draw him to the door. He suggested confronting him. I insisted ignoring him would be safer. I was wrong.

Then the gifts appeared.  
Old red trainers.  
Scratch cards taped with a note: “For luck. From Ben.”  
A stranger leaving personal objects at my doorstep made my skin crawl. I started hurrying inside like a fugitive, constantly checking behind me.

He escalated again. Late at night, the handle would jiggle. First a light test, then harder. I held my breath in the dark, heart pounding so violently I thought he might hear it.  
“That’s him again,” I whispered to my partner.  
Our home no longer felt like ours.

One night, everything slipped. I had forgotten to fully lock the door after bringing in groceries. We were watching TV in bed when something creaked. Soft. Slow. Wrong. I felt the change in the air before I heard the footsteps.  
“Who’s there?” my partner shouted.

We rushed out, and there he was.  
Ben.  
Inside our home.  
Not speaking. Just staring at me like I was something he owned.

“Get out!” my partner roared, shoving forward. Ben only backed away, eyes never leaving mine, then slipped out the door like he had every right to be there.

The police came, took notes, and gave us instructions that sounded more like suggestions. They needed more evidence, more proof of “intent.” My fear wasn’t measurable enough yet.

After they spoke with him, the knocks got less predictable. The messages angrier.  
“You shouldn’t have called the cops. That wasn’t nice.”

We installed a camera. The footage confirmed what I already knew. He waited outside my door. He listened. He memorized our patterns.

I couldn’t live like that anymore.

Aurora New Dawn picked up the phone when I finally couldn’t pretend to be strong.  
“My neighbor won’t leave me alone. He came into my flat. I’m scared,” I told them.

They took me seriously. They gathered everything and pushed what the authorities wouldn’t. They sat with me through every step, right up until the court date.

September 2022. High Wycombe Magistrates’ Court. I gave my statement by video link so I didn’t have to see his face again. Ben Ayre was convicted of stalking causing serious alarm. Community service. Rehabilitation. An indefinite restraining order. £600 compensation. No prison time, but a legal line drawn between us at last.

I moved away. I still double check locks more than most people. Silence in a building still makes me listen too closely. Fear doesn’t disappear just because paperwork says it should.

I remind myself I did everything I could. I trusted my instincts. I got help.  
I’m still rebuilding.

1ohcnra,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1ohcnra/i_have_to_be_the_change_i_want_to_make/,I have to be the change I want to make.,"I recently escaped an abusive situation that eventually led to trafficking. The process of waiting and seeking justice has been tumultuous for me. The waiting game was what was hitting the hardest for me as I am trying to meet with our DA to see if I can press charges and discuss my evidence. It's been tolling waiting and having to come to terms with their freedom.

Instead of allowing that to drown me in a fit of wanting vengeance, I decided to take the opportunity to work on myself and fully process what I endured and even further back - the entirety of my life. To accept and understand how these situations came to be.

What I chose to do was to combat drinking and utilize healthier methods such as meditation and journaling. I cut out negative self talk and self depreciation. I used to have that as a big part of my personality but it is no good nor healthy. I pray to Creator each day to give my thanks and ask for wisdom, guidance, and signs.

I refuse to be another statistic. I have come to far to fail and give up. I want to tell myself that I am worth surviving and allow myself the opportunity to believe it. I am almost a month in physically writing positive affirmations and reassurance expressing what I want and how I will accomplish it. So far, changing my perspective has changed my day to day. I am living in more present moments and the past is slowly eroding into nothingness. I have a long way to go to recover from what I went through, but I am grateful to show action versus inaction with a false pretense of hope.

Be the hope. You deserve to make the changes you want. Be the change you want to see in your life. You are allotted a whole life of transformation and to be in control of yourself. You may not get another opportunity - we truly do not know.

I have a long way to go and this post may just come across like a man drinking his morning coffee and rambling, but I hope this lands for someone who needs to be reminded that you ARE WORTH IT. Things will change when you're ready to take that first step. Inaction is the complacency that is a poison to use similarly to still water that grows a bacterial ecosystem.

We will heal and recover. Life can contain suffering but it should not be the only attribute. Take your first step to change when you're ready. Follow your gut. You got this. We will overcome. 🫂",1,1761566979.0,DecidingToBeBetter,0,1.0,False

One of my wife's friends invited herself - literally, texted and said they'd be vistiing and wanted to stay with us for the weekend.  I said to wife ""Ask them to stop at --- and bring some coffee and biscuits.  Trivial stuff - won't take them out of their way or cost much.

Wife thinks I'm an asshole even for asking.  Said she's mention it but if they bring anything she'll re-imburse them.  As she has no income that really means she wants me to re-imburse them.

Milwaukee woman’s homicide followed week of police encounters with daughter

Nikki Reich was scrolling through a story about a Milwaukee woman accused of beating her mother to death with a rock when a photo caught her eye.

“I just knew by her face, Carrie’s face,” Reich said.

Five days earlier, Reich saw Lauren Spors, Carrie Zettel's 29-year-old daughter, screaming and threatening people in an Oak Creek park. The police were called. Reich remembers Zettel crying and her daughter leaving in an ambulance.

Carrie Zettel poses with best friend Susan Hoffmann at Summerfest in 2018. Zettel's 29-year-old daughter, Lauren Spors, was charged Oct. 14 with first-degree intentional homicide, with a domestic abuse modifier, for killing her mother with a rock on Oct. 12.
The Oak Creek park incident was among at least five interactions Spors had with Milwaukee-area law enforcement in the week before prosecutors say she murdered her mother at her southern Milwaukee home, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel learned through police records and interviews.

In at least two of the incidents, Spors exhibited troubling behaviors indicative of an ongoing mental health crisis and was once taken to a local hospital, records show.

“We can look at the results of what happened here and somebody is dead,” said Alex Spors, Zettel's son and Lauren Spors' older brother. ""The police are not a sufficient response to this issue.”

When she was a teenager, Lauren Spors was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, which can cause delusions, mania and depression, according to medical records reviewed by a family member.

Those who know the family told the Journal Sentinel Lauren Spors struggled with drug use and homelessness and was in and out of mental health treatment centers. Zettel's attempts to help her daughter included frequently paying for her to stay in nearby hotels and trying to get her psychiatric help. 

Over the years, she was erratic and aggressive towards her mother and others. She didn't always understand her actions, court records show, stating she misremembered some events and acknowledged her mental health struggles.

In Wisconsin, the legal bar to force someone into mental health treatment is high. In each encounter, law enforcement officers say specific circumstances dictated how they responded to calls regarding Lauren Spors.

Mental health advocates said Lauren Spors' encounters with law enforcement in the days and hours before her mother was found dead show multiple points of possible intervention. Her story underscores the need for state law and how the criminal justice system interacts with those mentally ill to be reviewed, advocates told the Journal Sentinel.

Milwaukee Circuit Court Judge Cynthia Davis, who once ran Milwaukee’s mental health treatment court, presided over some of Lauren Spors’ past court proceedings. 

She declined to discuss Lauren Spors’ case in detail due to privacy laws but told the Journal Sentinel the incident was being reviewed “internally.”

“It certainly does highlight a concern that we are trying to address on a systemic level,” Davis said.

The incident Reich witnessed at Grant Park was the first of at least five police interactions leading up to Zettel’s death. That same day, Zettel told her friend her daughter had been kicked out of an Oak Creek motel.

It was a “day from hell,"" Zettel texted her friend, Loretta Moyer.

Reich, who frequents the park, said she would see Lauren Spors and her mom walking there on occasion. She said Lauren Spors often seemed distant and absent, while Zettel seemed nervous, once apologizing for her daughter’s demeanor as she passed by.  

Oct. 7 was different. Reich said Lauren Spors began to scream and threaten those around her, prompting a county worker to call the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office.

The Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office did not respond to several requests for comment.

The Oak Creek Police Department spoke with Lauren Spors at the hospital, after she said she wanted to report something that had happened to her, according to the department

In an email, Oak Creek Police Capt. Andy Sagan confirmed officers were called to the hospital regarding Lauren Spors on Oct. 7, then for a second time the following day. The department declined to provide further details, citing the need to review records. 

The next day, Zettel told Moyer in a text message that her daughter had been taken to a mental health facility.

Three days later, on Oct. 11, Froedtert Hospital staff called the Wauwatosa Police Department around 9:30 a.m., saying Lauren Spors had been discharged but refused to leave.

Records show Wauwatosa police gave Lauren Spors a ride to South 27th Street and West Ramsey Avenue, a few blocks from her mother’s house, and dropped her off.At approximately 8 p.m. that evening, Wauwatosa police were called to Metro Market after staff said Lauren Spors had stolen a juice and wouldn’t leave the women’s restroom.   

“When I made contact with Lauren, she seemed to be confused and hearing voices,” an officer wrote in the incident report. “I advised staff I would not be arresting Lauren, as the theft did not meet department standards.”

For the second time that day, police dropped off her off on a street corner, this time at the intersection of South 27th Street and West Oklahoma Avenue, near Aurora St. Luke’s Medical Center.

Wauwatosa Police Lt. Abby Pavlik said police made the decision not to take Lauren Spors into custody based on the facts available at the time. 

“During both contacts, Spors did not make any statements or display any behaviors indicating she was a danger to herself or others or that immediate medical or behavioral intervention — such as Chapter 51 detention — was warranted,” she wrote in a statement. 

Less than 24 hours later, investigators say Lauren Spors beat her mother to death with a rock.

The day of her death
Milwaukee police would be called three more times before Zettel took her last breath.

The first call came at 3:27 a.m. from a person reporting someone attempting to enter Zettel's home. Records show officers went to the home, but left after Zettel told them she was taking her daughter to a hotel.

Zettel then decided renting a hotel room for the night would be too expensive and let her daughter sleep in her car instead.

Next, police records show a call for a welfare check at 12:33 p.m. A Milwaukee police spokesperson said the call was canceled after ""the patient left the scene.”

Less than two hours later, at 2:04 p.m., police were called for the third time.

A neighbor said she was looking through her kitchen window and saw Zettel being attacked, according to police and court records. 

When police arrived, they found Zettel dead on the ground and Lauren Spors inside the home, according to a criminal complaint.

“The officers saw that Spors had blood on her feet, hands and face,” the complaint said. 

In response to questions about the calls, Milwaukee police said they were committed to working with partners to create a “safer city.” When asked for examples, the department linked to its violent crime plan. That includes being a member of a committee that reviews community violence alongside mental health organizations and other groups.

“The Milwaukee Police Department sends our condolences to the victim's family and loved ones,” the department said in its statement. 

As children, Alex Spors said he and his sister would play together with toy cars or have teatime. 

“It was a really normal childhood,” he said.

That began to change when his sister told him she saw a person on the ceiling.

It was the first sign of what would become her cyclical struggle with schizoaffective disorder. She would go to the hospital and get better, but it would only last a short period of time, Alex Spors said. She might miss a day of medicine, then it would repeat again.

From 2018 to 2021, Lauren Spors faced a number of charges for a series of violent incidents, including striking a manager at a coffee shop and throwing a rock through a window in an effort to break into her mother's house.

During that time, she was charged three times for violating restraining orders meant to keep her away from Zettel. A doctor found her mentally incompetent to stand trial each time.

“I was concerned, very concerned,” Alex Spors said. “I did say to my mom ... 'I fear that someday, everyone who lives with Lauren is going to die.'""

Lauren Spors is in custody and charged with first-degree intentional homicide.  

Milwaukee County Court Commissioner Barry Phillips has ordered the state to evaluate her mental health competency before she can stand trial. That report is expected by Nov. 21.

Lauren Spors’ attorney Vincent Guimont did not respond to a request for comment. 

Her history underscores the need for state law and how the criminal justice system interacts with those mentally ill to be reviewed, advocates told the Journal Sentinel.

Sandy Schultz, a founding member of the Milwaukee-area mental health advocacy organization ADMIRE, said it is all too common that people with severe mental illnesses do not receive adequate treatment, despite multiple interactions with law enforcement.

Lauren Spors should have been taken to involuntary treatment, especially given her history of escalating violence, she said.

“Scores of families plead with the system for help for their seriously ill loved ones every day,” Schultz said. “This will continue to happen until the system is changed and our loved ones get the treatment they deserve.”

The case draws parallels to the case of Isaiah Stott, who was shot and killed in an exchange of gunfire with Milwaukee police in February, one day after he told a police mental health crisis team that God had been speaking to him.

""Sadly, this is not a unique situation,” said Mary Kay Battaglia, the executive director of the Wisconsin branch of the National Alliance on Mental Illness.

Battaglia said the numerous interactions police had with Lauren Spors before her mother’s death are worthwhile for local departments to analyze. 

The legal requirements for an involuntary mental health hold also need to be examined and loosened, she said.

In Milwaukee County, law enforcement officers are the only people who can initiate an emergency mental health detention and send someone to be evaluated for a possible involuntary hospital stay. 

If police initiate a hold, the final decision to commit someone to involuntary treatment is in the hands of Milwaukee County Behavioral Health Services and the courts.  

Alex Spors said his sister's case illustrates the system is flawed.

""I'm not blaming any individual,"" he said. ""It's the system."" 

Moyer said those flaws left them with tragedy.

""I just lost my best friend because the system failed,"" she said.

1ohchxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelsfree/comments/1ohchxi/anyone_know_the_title/,Anyone know the Title?,"My lawyer husband came home drunk, pinned me down on the bed, and tore off my nightgown to kiss me.
We hadn't been this intimate in a long time. Ever since his law firm expanded, he rarely came home. His sudden passion caught me off guard. Just as I was about to reach climax, he suddenly said to me, ""Do you see it? I got your name tattooed on my heart.""
I saw the name ""Amelia"" tattooed on his chest. That wasn't my name—it belonged to his mistress.
Ethan noticed my rigidity, and his drunkenness instantly sobered by half. He sat up on the bed, his back to me, silent for a long time before finally speaking slowly, ""Tara, let's get divorced.""
My mind went completely blank. My heart felt like someone had viciously carved it out with a knife, so painful I could barely breathe.
He clutched his lighter, fingers trembling, yet his voice was calm: ""Amelia never cares about my money. She just wants a title. I should give it to her.""
Tears immediately blurred my vision. My voice trembled: ""When did it start?""
Ethan said, ""Three years ago, I was on a business trip in Chicago. The firm was in crisis, I was under tremendous pressure. That case was so tricky it kept me awake all night. That evening, she suddenly appeared at my hotel room door, soaked in rain, pitifully throwing herself into my arms. She comforted me, gave me warmth.""
I gripped the bedsheet tightly, my nails digging into my palms. Three years ago... I closed my eyes, tears falling silently.
I remembered that period when Ethan was overwhelmed by that difficult case, and his mother had just been in a car accident. I single-handedly rushed her to the hospital, so busy I nearly collapsed, while also taking care of Bella. Even so, I still found time to text him:
——【Don't worry, I'll handle everything. You focus on winning that case.】
——【No matter what, our family is here for you.】
That night, I thought I was supporting our little family. But him? He was in another city, falling in love with another woman.
I never imagined he could hide it for three years!
For three years, he played the role of a proper husband in front of our family while sleeping with another woman.
I looked up at him through my tears, ""Ethan, if you weren't a successful and wealthy lawyer, would she still want you?""
Ethan turned his head away, looking at the corner of the bedroom, his tone unsettling: ""Tara, I know you love me. But Amelia isn't after my money. For three years, she's had no status, endured so much pain. I can't disappoint her anymore.""
So he could disappoint me instead?
 

Chapter 2
I thought back to when we first got together. We were college sweethearts, graduated from the same university with the same major, and after graduation lived in a run-down apartment, dreaming of opening our own law firm someday.
In those years, we'd write briefs while eating cheap fast food.
The heating in our cheap apartment wasn't enough, and in winter, I was always shivering with cold. He would often hold my hands and embrace me.
His eyes burned with fire: ""Tara, someday we'll own the best law firm in the city.""
But now, standing at the peak of success, he was pushing me into the abyss.
I cried and questioned him: ""Have you forgotten? On our wedding day, before the priest, you swore to love me forever!""
Ethan's tone was so calm it chilled my heart: ""Tara, we were too young then, mistaking passion for love. Now we're thirty-five, and I finally understand what true love is.""
""True love?"" I laughed bitterly, my laughter filled with despair.
Just then, his phone screen lit up.
【Amelia: The light at home is broken, can you come help me fix it?】
A gentle smile appeared at the corner of his lips—the kind of tenderness I hadn't seen in ages. He got up and put on his jacket, not even sparing me a glance as he walked straight out of the bedroom.
The moment the door closed, my world completely collapsed.
I stumbled into the study, opened the computer, and entered his password that had never changed—Bella's birthday. The screen immediately lit up, revealing tens of thousands of messages.
Every word, every emoji was like a knife, carving into my heart one by one. They had shared romantic dinners, tender trips, and even on our wedding anniversary, he had slept with her that afternoon.
【Amelia: Ethan, my skin is all red. You touched me, can you please not touch her anymore? It would make me sad.】
【Ethan: Rest well, don't overthink it. I had you five times this afternoon, I have no energy left.】
【Amelia: I'm learning to make your favorite baked fish now. When you come over, I can cook it for you.】
【Ethan: No, darling, you don't need to go through all that trouble to please me. Just standing in front of me, you're already the most beautiful sight.】
I hugged my arms tightly, tears flowing unstoppably.
So after years of marriage, familiarity couldn't compete with novelty.
It was time to let go.
I took a deep breath, picked up the phone, and dialed a number I hadn't called frequently in years. The phone was quickly answered, and my father's steady voice came through: ""Tara? It's so late, what's wrong?""
With all the strength I could muster, I choked out: ""Dad, Ethan is cheating. I want a divorce. Please withdraw your investment from his law firm.""
 

Chapter 3
Ethan never knew that his law firm was funded by my father.
When he was just starting out, Ethan's business was struggling.
Once when the firm's cash flow broke down, he stayed awake all night, his eyes bloodshot, even breaking down in front of me, clutching his hair and saying that if this case failed, it would mean losing everything.
My father was wealthy. After the divorce, he went to France and built his own company.
But in my mother's heart, he was already dead. She had warned me: ""Don't take a penny from that man.""
But for Ethan's sake, I still took a long flight, stood alone in my father's office, endured my stepmother's cold stares and mockery, and humbly begged him to invest.
I didn't tell anyone. Because I knew Ethan's pride wouldn't allow him to admit he survived on someone else's charity. So in his eyes, he had always been a self-made lawyer who built his current firm through talent and perseverance.
And because of his outstanding abilities, he attracted countless investors.
He would never know that I had sacrificed all my pride to win him a lifeline.
I didn't sleep all night. The next day, I took Bella to kindergarten as usual. She carried her little backpack, looking back every few steps, reminding me: ""Mommy, you have to come pick me up early.""
I nodded with a smile, but my heart ached.
After leaving the school gate, I didn't go home. Curiosity and unease drove me to the coffee shop downstairs from Ethan's law firm. I sat by the floor-to-ceiling window, ordered a latte, and stared at that familiar entrance, sitting there all afternoon.
In the evening, Ethan finally came out. His figure was upright, his face showing post-work fatigue. But behind him, a young, beautiful woman followed, with a bright smile and adoring eyes.
I was stunned. I had seen that face in the firm's group photos. Amelia was actually his assistant.
He had brought her into his company to facilitate his affair?
My heart felt like it had been struck by a sledgehammer, numb with pain. I took a deep breath, pulled out my phone to text my mother, asking her to pick up Bella from kindergarten. I then drove to follow Ethan from a distance.
Their car drove into a secluded villa area by the river. Night was just falling, and the lights on the second floor came on. I stopped the car and pulled out binoculars.
Through the window, with white curtains half-drawn, I witnessed a sickening scene. Amelia wore a thin dress, kneeling on Ethan's lap, giggling as her hands unbuttoned his shirt one by one. His eyes burned with desire like flames as he pulled her tightly into his arms, kissing her passionately.
When was the last time I had seen such fervor and longing? With me, he had long grown impatient.
I knew our relationship was dead.
The binoculars in my hands nearly cracked from my grip. My fingertips were ice cold, my chest aching in waves. Fighting back tremors, I pulled out my phone and sent Ethan a message.
——【I agree to the divorce. But let's wait until after Bella's fourth birthday.】
 

Chapter 4
I thought he would at least show some restraint. But I never expected him to be so impatient.
At my friend Lucy's birthday party, he actually showed up with Amelia. At that moment, all the guests' eyes fell on the three of us, the air thick with suffocating awkwardness.
Robert—Lucy's husband—tried to reason with him: ""Ethan, are you serious? Tara stood by you through the hardest times. She's your true partner. Don't destroy your family over a momentary infatuation.""
But Ethan just leaned back in his chair, looking weary, his tone cold: ""Amelia isn't what you all think. She's pure. I'm tired of this bland married life.""
""God, you're going to regret this,"" Robert shook his head.
Lucy let out a cold laugh, raised her wine glass, and fixed Amelia with a sharp gaze: ""Newcomer should know the rules. Come on, toast everyone, starting with Tara.""
The atmosphere suddenly froze. Amelia's face went pale, her fingers trembling as she gripped the wine glass, her voice barely audible: ""I... I don't drink much.""
Lucy's smile deepened, tinged with provocation: ""The first time is hard, the second time gets easier. Since you could climb into Ethan's bed, you should at least have this much courage, right?""
At that moment, Ethan spoke up, his tone suddenly sharp: ""That's enough, Lucy. She's not like you—she's innocent, shy. Stop making things difficult for her.""
I sat at the table, watching quietly, but inside I felt only cold laughter. He could publicly defend her while remaining blind to my humiliation.
Halfway through the party, I excused myself to the restroom. In the hallway corner, I ran into Amelia who was touching up her makeup. At this moment, she no longer wore the pitiful expression she showed everyone else, but had sharp eyes and a smirking smile.
She slowly turned around, looking at me coldly: ""Tara, are you jealous of me?""
I replied coldly: ""Jealous of what? Jealous that you're young but have nothing? Or jealous that you're content being a mistress, destroying someone else's family?""
Amelia's face stiffened, fire igniting in her eyes, her lips trembling: ""Tara, don't be so smug. Ethan doesn't love you anymore. You can't change that. Your desperate attempts to save your marriage only make you look pathetic.""
I met her gaze fearlessly: ""Our divorce is entirely Ethan's fault. I'll make sure he leaves with nothing. The house, money, daughter—all mine. Doesn't that sound wonderful? Why would I be upset?""
""And you? A girl in her twenties, you'll have to help a penniless Ethan start from scratch, while taking care of his paralyzed mother.""
 

Chapter 5
""How is that possible? You haven't worked in years. You've been depending on Ethan's money. How could you leave him with nothing? I'll be the one living comfortably.""
How laughable. The only thing she cared about was Ethan's money, yet Ethan thought she truly loved him.
I looked forward to seeing Ethan's face when he discovered the truth and found himself with nothing.
Just then, the restroom door was pushed open. Ethan stood in the doorway, frowning, his gaze immediately falling on Amelia.
She threw herself into his arms like a frightened deer, tears welling up as she choked out: ""Ethan, I don't mind being hurt a little... please don't blame Tara...""
Her performance was incredibly convincing, tears rolling down her lashes and dripping onto his shirt.
I watched this scene with cold eyes, feeling nothing but disgust.
Ethan immediately embraced her, his voice gentle: ""You're always like this, putting yourself last, only thinking of others. Don't cry.""
Then he looked up, his eyes sharp as they fixed on me: ""Tara, how could you do this? If you want to take it out on someone, take it out on me! Amelia is still so young, so innocent. She hasn't experienced any hardships. Why treat her this way?""
I couldn't help but laugh coldly: ""Young? Yes, she's young, so she can brazenly wreck a marriage and destroy a family? And you, Ethan, you're stupider than I ever imagined.""
Amelia shrank in his arms, but I caught a flash of triumph in her eyes. I realized that instead of crying and pleading, I should grip my weapons and prepare to fight back.
I stopped arguing and simply turned to leave the restroom. The hallway lights were cold and white, falling on me like armor.
Lucy stood in the distance, watching me with complex eyes. She said quietly: ""Tara, you're too calm. If it were me, I would have flipped that table already.""
I raised the corner of my lips in a meaningful smile: ""Why flip it? Evidence is more useful than tears and anger.""
""Sorry for ruining your birthday party. Should we hit the bar for round two? My treat.""
""Are you okay?"" Lucy looked at me with concern.
""Of course. Consider it celebrating my upcoming return to single life,"" I said to Lucy with a smile.
I told my mother about my plans to divorce. After hearing about my marriage, she sighed: ""Well, Tara, I've always wanted you to be happy. I never thought your marriage would fail too. But whatever you decide, I support you. However, we must fight for Bella's custody.""
""Don't worry, Mom. I'll do my best.""
 

Chapter 6
Early the next morning, I met with my lawyer friend and handed him the evidence I had compiled overnight. Chat records between Ethan and Amelia, travel photos, even credit card bills... everything was detailed and comprehensive.
Michael flipped through the documents, his expression growing darker. ""Tara, you did well.""
He paused, his tone firm: ""You were a lawyer once too, so you understand that adultery itself isn't grounds for property division. But if one party squanders marital assets on an affair during the marriage—like buying luxury goods, paying for trips, renting apartments—that constitutes Marital Waste. The court will require him to compensate you during property division.""
I clenched my hands tightly. My heart felt cold. The bills Michael had pulled showed that the amounts Ethan had spent on Amelia were staggering—Hermès bags, Cartier bracelets, Chanel haute couture dresses... The total was enough to buy another house.
I stared at that long list of luxury items, my heart feeling crushed repeatedly. All these years, I had scrimped and saved for the family, wearing the same clothes for three or four years, while he carelessly squandered money on his mistress.
I said quietly: ""I want him to cough up every penny.""
Michael looked up, his gaze determined: ""Don't worry. The law will be on your side.""
A few days later, it was Bella's birthday. This was something we had agreed on in advance, something she had been looking forward to for so long. I didn't want to disappoint her.
I texted Ethan:
——【I hope you can come for Bella's birthday. After that day, we'll file for divorce.】
He quickly replied with ""okay.""
I thought that even if it was just pretending, he would at least give our daughter a decent birthday.
But I underestimated him.
That afternoon, the house was decorated warmly and festively. Balloons floated in mid-air, and a pink cake sat on the dining table. Bella wore a princess dress and a little crown, excitedly waiting for her father.
The doorbell rang. Bella excitedly ran to open the door.
However, Ethan wasn't the only one at the door. Amelia stood beside him, a triumphant smile on her lips, holding an exquisitely wrapped gift.
I froze in place, my chest turning cold.
Bella blinked in confusion and asked: ""Daddy, who is she?""
Amelia slowly crouched down, her voice gentle but every word laced with provocation: ""Sweetheart, I'm your daddy's girlfriend. And your future—stepmother.""
My breath caught. My heart exploded with pain.
Ethan frowned but didn't stop her, only saying softly: ""Amelia, don't—""
She suddenly raised her hand to her belly, her eyes flickering as she deliberately raised her voice: ""Tara, you should congratulate us. I'm pregnant. Soon, Ethan and I will get married. Bella will have a new little brother or sister too. Aren't you happy? You'll be a big sister!""
Her voice was filled with uncontrollable smugness.
BOOM—
It felt like the entire world exploded in my ears.
Bella's little face froze, tears welling up in her eyes. Rage surged in my chest like a tidal wave.
Before she could finish speaking, SLAP—I struck her hard across the face!
The living room fell into sudden silence. Everyone was stunned.

# Chapter 17 - A Working Theory

We did not end up camping that night, like Dale had suggested. Instead, we ended up at a truck stop on the outskirts of town, parked in the back corner far away from the overhead lights. It was the worst sleep I’ve gotten on this complete nightmare of an adventure we’ve been on. The only thing I hated more than sleeping in a tent was sleeping in a cramped car. Even a minivan with its marginally larger room, was too cramped for me. But at least no witch or clown showed up to interrupt our broken sleep. Not that I needed many interruptions from supernatural manifestations of my childhood horror. Rolling over into the seatbelt buckle multiple times did that enough for me.

With bags under our eyes, we ordered breakfast and coffee at the truck stop’s diner. Riley’s phone was sitting on the table between us. Dale hadn’t cracked it yet. I don’t think he wanted to unlock our next adventure so soon. And after our fight yesterday, I wasn’t going to prod him. Not yet. Right now, all I wanted was food and coffee, and we got plenty.

“Tell me everything you know about Gyroscope,” Dale said after our coffees came.

“I’ve told you most of everything I know.” I said.

“Most, but not everything.”

“True.” I took a deep breath. “I didn’t want to scare you. Plus, they’re just urban legends. It’s not like it’s even the truth. Would be pointless to tell you anything like the Station if it doesn’t exist.”

“The Station?”

“Yeah. Or the Studio. Depending on who you ask, it’s called one or the other, or both.” I took a sip of my coffee. “It’s thought to be both the originator of the video and the final destination of those who give in to their persistence.”

“Like what happened to Bruno, Riley, and Mike?”

Mike, I had almost forgotten about Mike at this point.

“Well, we aren’t sure about Mike,” I said. “But it’s definitely likely. But yeah, Bruno and Riley for sure.”

“What happens at the Station?”

I shrugged. “The usual, for horror, that is. A fate worse than death. An endless cycle of terror followed by a false sense of reprieve, and once you think everything is alright, the terror begins again. Never ending.”

Dale looked at me with wide eyes. “You mean if we don’t get to the bottom of this, I’m going to deal with that stupid clown forever?”

“This is why I didn’t want to tell you. Plus, it’s not like it’s true. These are urban legends. I mean, how would we even know what happens in the Station if people never leave? Maybe when the persistences take people, they just die. But their bodies are taken for some reason.”

“Like that’s any better.”

“Better than an eternity of torment.”

“Anything else you haven’t told me?”

“I think that’s it. If you don’t believe me, just Google ‘Gyroscope creepypasta.’”

“Creepypasta?”

“Wow, you really are out of touch with the horror community. They’re dumb short horror stories people share online, usually touted as true even though they’re obviously lies. Internet campfire stories. Mostly poorly written. Gyroscope was no different. In fact, it was pretty forgettable, but somehow it developed a cult following. I guess in hindsight, it’s probably because it is true.”

Our food arrived. We paid little attention to it as we continued to talk.

“Does this creepypasta say anything about the rules of our persistences?”

I shook my head.

“Great,” Dale sighed. “So they have no rules.”

“What? No, everything operates on rules. I think we just need to figure them out. Like I thought they would operate using movie rules, but after I tried to distract Ernest when he took you, he didn’t react.”

“What do you mean?”

“There’s a line in the movies, one that always reminds Ernest of his mom. Usually, saying it always momentarily distracts him. It didn’t happen the other night, either time.”

“So what does that mean, then?”

I shrugged. “My best guess is that the persistences act in the ways our minds corrupted them to be. Or we remember them to be. Like, who is the Jesterror to you?”

“You’ve seen him.”

“I mean behaviorally. I know all the movies, so I’ll know what’s off.”

Dale shivered. “I only saw one scene. While flipping through channels as a kid. Actually, it was my brother who was flipping through channels. I remember seeing a creepy clown dangling upside down from a chandelier in a house. Laughing and cackling at the people below as they tried to hide in the room. They never looked up. His eyes trained on them, smiling and laughing. My brother flipped to the next channel before we could see what happened next. Ever since then, I saw that stupid clown to be a stalker of sorts, one that laughs at other people’s misery that he created. Perched upside down, like a bat.”

I thought about it for a moment. “That’s the only scene he’s upside down.” I said. “The actor playing the Jesterror, Clive something, I forgot his last name, actually got injured performing that stunt. The prop he hung from, although not nearly as high up as the movie makes it out to be, gave out during one take. He tweaked his neck, didn’t break anything at least, but that’s why for the rest of the movie the Jesterror is wearing a funny-looking collar. A poorly disguised neck brace dressed up to look vaguely clown-like. Lots of fans blame the injury for the movie bombing. The studio tried to replace him during filming, but Clive needed the money and the acting credit for his resume, so he threatened to sue for the injury or keep him on. The studio ran the numbers and decided that it was best to keep an injured actor over legal action. Clive didn’t really have the best career after that. They say he’s an asshole to work with. He didn’t even return for the sequels.”

“And your point is?”

“That, you’re right, to an extent. The Jesterror gets off on stalking and terrorizing people. But you tuned into a rather tame spot. If you had flipped there five minutes earlier, you would have seen a woman get ripped to shreds with his claws. Ten minutes later, you would have seen a man’s face get bitten off as he screamed and the Jesterror now inexplicably, donned a strange-looking neck brace. That’s another weird thing about the movie. They shot everything in order. The director was not the most competent. Makes for a good popcorn flick to make fun of with your friends, though. The sequels - well, at least the second one - are marginally better.”

Dale gave me a look, reminding me I had gotten off track again.

“The point is, your manifestation of him is actually quite tame. Your persistence could be way more fucked up.”

“Well, thanks,” Dale said sarcastically. He picked up his fork and took a bite of his food. I did the same too. Nothing like cheap plastic-tasting eggs and rubbery bacon of truck stops. The pancakes were passable at least, but most things are once you dress them up in enough butter and syrup.

“So,” Dale said between bites. “We need to figure out how the next victim we find perceived their persistence in order to better understand what we’re up against?”

“It couldn’t hurt.”

“Alright, anything else?”

“Well, there’s the house and the motel room too, I guess. When I left the house initially, the lights were on, same as the motel.”

Dale took a bite, then a sip of coffee. “Last night, when I pulled you out, after I crossed the threshold, I didn’t see anything anymore. Not the witch, nor the clown. You were just lying there screaming.”

“Well, that’s weird.”

“I think your theory is right. That they can’t go outside.”

I groaned. God, if they can’t form outside and I had to live the rest of my life sleeping among mosquitoes and bears for the remainder of it, well, then just kill me now.

We continued to talk about our thoughts on the rules for our persistences. Misguided or not, it was nice to actually try to get some sort of theory in place. We settled on three potential rules. One, that they behave how we perceive. Two, that they hate the outside as much as I do. And three, that they take time to mature. We weren’t entirely sure on why ours didn’t seem “mature” yet, my theory is that we were knowledgeable enough about Gyroscope that their existence was much more expected to us than to Bruno or Riley, and that knowledge was keeping them at bay. I think solidifying a theory helped Dale as well. He looked better after we talked, not by much, his chronic terror now just a chronic anxiety. Marginally better, but still better.

“So, are we ready? Ready to get on with our next destination?” I asked. Our plates now empty. I felt the energy from the food and coffee revitalize my body. Mostly from the coffee, though. Five cups of cheap coffee will do that to you.

“I’d never say that I’m ready, but it’s not like we have a choice, do we?” Dale said.

“You know what I mean.”

Dale pocketed Riley’s phone and stood up. “Alright, let’s go.” He sighed.

I followed behind him out into the parking lot. Unsure of what will be in store for us next.",1,1761566491.0,QuadrantNine,0,1.0,False

I woke up already tired  the kind of tired that sleep doesn’t fix, only justice can. My “holiday” Saturday had been stolen, my Sunday was a blur of resentment and caffeine, and now here I was, logging in on a Monday morning, pretending to care about Q4 projections.

The first message I see?

“Good morning team! Hope you all had a relaxing weekend. Let’s give this week our best shot!”

Relaxing weekend??? Sir, the only thing I relaxed was my morals when I almost texted you what I really think.

Anyway, before I could even finish my coffee, he calls for a “quick catch-up.” Quick. That word should be banned in corporate language. Because guess what? It wasn’t quick. It was 57 minutes of him speaking in circles about “synergy,” “momentum,” and how “we need to step up.”

Step up? I’ve been stepping up so much I’m basically on a treadmill at this point.

By lunch, my patience had evaporated. I was staring at my screen, contemplating my life choices, when he pings again:“Let’s regroup at 3 PM for an alignment discussion.”

Regroup? Bro, we never un-grouped.

And of course, the meeting that was “just to align” turned into him handing out new tasks like Oprah giving away cars. Everyone gets a deliverable! Everyone gets a deadline! Everyone gets anxiety!

By 6 PM, he hits us with his signature line, the one that could trigger PTSD in any employee: “Can we quickly stay back for 15 minutes to close the loop?”

Close the loop?? Sir, it’s Monday. The only loop I’m closing is my laptop.

That’s when it hit me. My manager doesn’t believe in time, weekends, or the concept of peace. To him, life is one endless Google Meet. He’s like the final boss in the game of burnout.

So yeah, that’s how my Monday went. The “post-holiday” that never was. I didn’t crush goals. I crushed my sanity.

At this point, I’m convinced the Indian corporate ecosystem runs on coffee, chaos, and collective trauma.

And honestly? If my manager sends one more “motivational quote” this week, I might just send him a resignation letter in the form of a meme.",0,1761566432.0,Office365,0,0.5,False

It’s set up how I like and it works for me.  Over the years I have always placed my candy bowl out for you wasteland trick or treaters to come and grab some candy… however… this year, after the camp revamp update my candy bowl has gone missing (gasp).  On the map is shows the little pumpkin symbol indicating I have a bowl, but the bowl itself is not where I have always placed it e every year.  I remember removing it before the update, thinking I would just make another one when Halloween came around, but now the game THINKS I still have an active bowl and it won’t let me build another bowl because of the build limit on objects like that!!!  People come to my camp expecting candy and run all around looking for my non-existent bowl with many a confused or angry emojis spinning over their heads :(. I have looked everywhere in my camp via free cam mode… under the floor boards, in walls, inside everything I have there to make sure it didn’t get accidentally shoved somewhere weird and can’t find any trace of it :(

Any ideas or thoughts would be appreciated.   I had a similar thing happen to my coffee and tea machines when revamping my camp after that update, they disappeared but still registered as there so I couldn’t build more… I eventually scrapped the table they were sitting on and viola, they turned up in my stored items in the build menu!   And before someone suggests doing this for the bowl, I sadly already tried… it was sitting on the edge of my hot tub on my “deck” (easily found and seen so as not to add frustration to people’s searches!!!) and I scrapped my entire deck and everything in it and rebuilt it without success in finding my darn bowl.  

Halloween is my fav holiday and I love taking part in the little bit of fun that Bethesda gives us!   I have other camps that have bowls that I can use, but this is my MAIN camp.  It’s set up exactly how I like it and I would really like to solve this problem.  Any input would be greatly appreciated!!  Happy Halloween wastelanders :)",1,1761566422.0,fo76,4,1.0,False

I desperately miss the energy boost from caffeine. I originally decided to try decaf because of anxiety. I didn’t want to go on meds and besides exercise, going decaf was another way to lower anxiety without pharmaceuticals. I have a family with young kids so the morning is really my only opportunity to exercise. I have more energy and can push myself in the afternoons but I am rarely able to make that happen with my schedule. Anyone have any experience they can share?

# Chapter 17 - A Working Theory

We did not end up camping that night, like Dale had suggested. Instead, we ended up at a truck stop on the outskirts of town, parked in the back corner far away from the overhead lights. It was the worst sleep I’ve gotten on this complete nightmare of an adventure we’ve been on. The only thing I hated more than sleeping in a tent was sleeping in a cramped car. Even a minivan with its marginally larger room, was too cramped for me. But at least no witch or clown showed up to interrupt our broken sleep. Not that I needed many interruptions from supernatural manifestations of my childhood horror. Rolling over into the seatbelt buckle multiple times did that enough for me.

With bags under our eyes, we ordered breakfast and coffee at the truck stop’s diner. Riley’s phone was sitting on the table between us. Dale hadn’t cracked it yet. I don’t think he wanted to unlock our next adventure so soon. And after our fight yesterday, I wasn’t going to prod him. Not yet. Right now, all I wanted was food and coffee, and we got plenty.

“Tell me everything you know about Gyroscope,” Dale said after our coffees came.

“I’ve told you most of everything I know.” I said.

“Most, but not everything.”

“True.” I took a deep breath. “I didn’t want to scare you. Plus, they’re just urban legends. It’s not like it’s even the truth. Would be pointless to tell you anything like the Station if it doesn’t exist.”

“The Station?”

“Yeah. Or the Studio. Depending on who you ask, it’s called one or the other, or both.” I took a sip of my coffee. “It’s thought to be both the originator of the video and the final destination of those who give in to their persistence.”

“Like what happened to Bruno, Riley, and Mike?”

Mike, I had almost forgotten about Mike at this point.

“Well, we aren’t sure about Mike,” I said. “But it’s definitely likely. But yeah, Bruno and Riley for sure.”

“What happens at the Station?”

I shrugged. “The usual, for horror, that is. A fate worse than death. An endless cycle of terror followed by a false sense of reprieve, and once you think everything is alright, the terror begins again. Never ending.”

“Well, there’s the house and the motel room too, I guess. When I left the house initially, the lights were on, same as the motel.”

Dale took a bite, then a sip of coffee. “Last night, when I pulled you out, after I crossed the threshold, I didn’t see anything anymore. Not the witch, nor the clown. You were just lying there screaming.”

“Well, that’s weird.”

But oh my god, I found the cave in the Ravine, sun was setting. I set my bed up got my fire going. Long voyage from Desolation Point to Mystery Lake. My levels are all perfect. Life is good.

I leave the cave at dusk to collect firewood, I literally looked back at the cave and said “if all goes wrong. Go THAT way” well of course a blizzard struck, it became pitch black. It was a nightmare. I became frantic, my heart was about to literally bust out of my chest. I popped a flare and searched and searched and searched. I knew it. I WAS GOING TO DIE HERE (30 days in, my very first survival run, after finishing Wintermute). I was so proud of myself and I was so unbelievably sad. I was about to die just frantically searching. It was such a sad scene. Literally as I am drawing my last breath. I. FIND. THE. CAVE. 

I can’t believe it!!!!!!!!!! Mind you I woke up at 5am, made a fat French press coffee, turned all LED’s on, sat back and got 2+ hours in before work. I mean I cannot stress how amazing life was. THIS WOULD’VE RUINED MY WHOLE DAY BRO. But here we are, can’t take me down that easy!! 😤😤😤

Was so stressed about finding a game after KCD2, because that game was a life changer and I stumbled across this game. 9/10 survival game. Love you all. Blessings. ",9,1761565927.0,thelongdark,2,1.0,False

For the past 2 years I've had:  

* Fatigue, low energy, coffee ineffective, often sleep in the middle of the day then wake up even more tired and with a headache
* Low mood, brain fog, depression, no motivation
* Weird sleep problems (sleeping more than usual, sleeping is ""unpleasant"", getting up in the morning is difficult)
* Sex drive completely gone, but sex hormones are normal
* Sore/tender nodules appeared behind both nipples, shows up on CT scan, diagnosed as mild gynecomastia
* Dry cough, feeling of constant ""urge to cough"" irritation in the airways for no reason. Gets worse in steam such as during a shower and when getting up and moving around.
* Tight feeling around neck, though this has gotten better in the past year. They did an ultrasound of my neck and thyroid and found nothing.
* Joint pain: lower back pain, sacrum joint painful and clicking (as if there's sand in the joint), neck stiffness, rough sounds when I turn my head
* Weird digestion problems. One day it's constipation, the other day it's diarrhea for no reason despite eating the same healthy things I always have. Constant bloating and huge pocket of air in right side of large intestine, like a liter of air just always being there in the same place. Shows up on CT scan. Most of the time I feel a bit constipated, not enough to cause problems.

Don't smoke, don't drink, healthy weight, eat healthy, nothing that I can think of.

* TSH a year ago (already had symptoms then): 2.8 mIU/L
* TSH two months ago: 4.4 mIU/L
* TSH one month ago: 5.3 mIU/L
* T3 and T4 well within range.

Symptoms not improving or getting worse.

Doctor says TSH is not that high and that I don't have to do anything.

When asked if my list of symptoms could be related, he said he doesn't think so.

# Chapter 17 - A Working Theory

We did not end up camping that night, like Dale had suggested. Instead, we ended up at a truck stop on the outskirts of town, parked in the back corner far away from the overhead lights. It was the worst sleep I’ve gotten on this complete nightmare of an adventure we’ve been on. The only thing I hated more than sleeping in a tent was sleeping in a cramped car. Even a minivan with its marginally larger room, was too cramped for me. But at least no witch or clown showed up to interrupt our broken sleep. Not that I needed many interruptions from supernatural manifestations of my childhood horror. Rolling over into the seatbelt buckle multiple times did that enough for me.

With bags under our eyes, we ordered breakfast and coffee at the truck stop’s diner. Riley’s phone was sitting on the table between us. Dale hadn’t cracked it yet. I don’t think he wanted to unlock our next adventure so soon. And after our fight yesterday, I wasn’t going to prod him. Not yet. Right now, all I wanted was food and coffee, and we got plenty.

“Tell me everything you know about Gyroscope,” Dale said after our coffees came.

“I’ve told you most of everything I know.” I said.

“Most, but not everything.”

“True.” I took a deep breath. “I didn’t want to scare you. Plus, they’re just urban legends. It’s not like it’s even the truth. Would be pointless to tell you anything like the Station if it doesn’t exist.”

“The Station?”

“Yeah. Or the Studio. Depending on who you ask, it’s called one or the other, or both.” I took a sip of my coffee. “It’s thought to be both the originator of the video and the final destination of those who give in to their persistence.”

“Like what happened to Bruno, Riley, and Mike?”

Mike, I had almost forgotten about Mike at this point.

“Well, we aren’t sure about Mike,” I said. “But it’s definitely likely. But yeah, Bruno and Riley for sure.”

“What happens at the Station?”

I shrugged. “The usual, for horror, that is. A fate worse than death. An endless cycle of terror followed by a false sense of reprieve, and once you think everything is alright, the terror begins again. Never ending.”

Dale looked at me with wide eyes. “You mean if we don’t get to the bottom of this, I’m going to deal with that stupid clown forever?”

“This is why I didn’t want to tell you. Plus, it’s not like it’s true. These are urban legends. I mean, how would we even know what happens in the Station if people never leave? Maybe when the persistences take people, they just die. But their bodies are taken for some reason.”

“Like that’s any better.”

“Better than an eternity of torment.”

“Anything else you haven’t told me?”

“I think that’s it. If you don’t believe me, just Google ‘Gyroscope creepypasta.’”

“Creepypasta?”

“Wow, you really are out of touch with the horror community. They’re dumb short horror stories people share online, usually touted as true even though they’re obviously lies. Internet campfire stories. Mostly poorly written. Gyroscope was no different. In fact, it was pretty forgettable, but somehow it developed a cult following. I guess in hindsight, it’s probably because it is true.”

Our food arrived. We paid little attention to it as we continued to talk.

“Does this creepypasta say anything about the rules of our persistences?”

I shook my head.

“Great,” Dale sighed. “So they have no rules.”

“What? No, everything operates on rules. I think we just need to figure them out. Like I thought they would operate using movie rules, but after I tried to distract Ernest when he took you, he didn’t react.”

“What do you mean?”

“There’s a line in the movies, one that always reminds Ernest of his mom. Usually, saying it always momentarily distracts him. It didn’t happen the other night, either time.”

“So what does that mean, then?”

I shrugged. “My best guess is that the persistences act in the ways our minds corrupted them to be. Or we remember them to be. Like, who is the Jesterror to you?”

“You’ve seen him.”

“I mean behaviorally. I know all the movies, so I’ll know what’s off.”

Dale shivered. “I only saw one scene. While flipping through channels as a kid. Actually, it was my brother who was flipping through channels. I remember seeing a creepy clown dangling upside down from a chandelier in a house. Laughing and cackling at the people below as they tried to hide in the room. They never looked up. His eyes trained on them, smiling and laughing. My brother flipped to the next channel before we could see what happened next. Ever since then, I saw that stupid clown to be a stalker of sorts, one that laughs at other people’s misery that he created. Perched upside down, like a bat.”

I thought about it for a moment. “That’s the only scene he’s upside down.” I said. “The actor playing the Jesterror, Clive something, I forgot his last name, actually got injured performing that stunt. The prop he hung from, although not nearly as high up as the movie makes it out to be, gave out during one take. He tweaked his neck, didn’t break anything at least, but that’s why for the rest of the movie the Jesterror is wearing a funny-looking collar. A poorly disguised neck brace dressed up to look vaguely clown-like. Lots of fans blame the injury for the movie bombing. The studio tried to replace him during filming, but Clive needed the money and the acting credit for his resume, so he threatened to sue for the injury or keep him on. The studio ran the numbers and decided that it was best to keep an injured actor over legal action. Clive didn’t really have the best career after that. They say he’s an asshole to work with. He didn’t even return for the sequels.”

“And your point is?”

“That, you’re right, to an extent. The Jesterror gets off on stalking and terrorizing people. But you tuned into a rather tame spot. If you had flipped there five minutes earlier, you would have seen a woman get ripped to shreds with his claws. Ten minutes later, you would have seen a man’s face get bitten off as he screamed and the Jesterror now inexplicably, donned a strange-looking neck brace. That’s another weird thing about the movie. They shot everything in order. The director was not the most competent. Makes for a good popcorn flick to make fun of with your friends, though. The sequels - well, at least the second one - are marginally better.”

Dale gave me a look, reminding me I had gotten off track again.

“The point is, your manifestation of him is actually quite tame. Your persistence could be way more fucked up.”

“Well, thanks,” Dale said sarcastically. He picked up his fork and took a bite of his food. I did the same too. Nothing like cheap plastic-tasting eggs and rubbery bacon of truck stops. The pancakes were passable at least, but most things are once you dress them up in enough butter and syrup.

“So,” Dale said between bites. “We need to figure out how the next victim we find perceived their persistence in order to better understand what we’re up against?”

“It couldn’t hurt.”

“Alright, anything else?”

“Well, there’s the house and the motel room too, I guess. When I left the house initially, the lights were on, same as the motel.”

Dale took a bite, then a sip of coffee. “Last night, when I pulled you out, after I crossed the threshold, I didn’t see anything anymore. Not the witch, nor the clown. You were just lying there screaming.”

“Well, that’s weird.”

“I think your theory is right. That they can’t go outside.”

I groaned. God, if they can’t form outside and I had to live the rest of my life sleeping among mosquitoes and bears for the remainder of it, well, then just kill me now.

We continued to talk about our thoughts on the rules for our persistences. Misguided or not, it was nice to actually try to get some sort of theory in place. We settled on three potential rules. One, that they behave how we perceive. Two, that they hate the outside as much as I do. And three, that they take time to mature. We weren’t entirely sure on why ours didn’t seem “mature” yet, my theory is that we were knowledgeable enough about Gyroscope that their existence was much more expected to us than to Bruno or Riley, and that knowledge was keeping them at bay. I think solidifying a theory helped Dale as well. He looked better after we talked, not by much, his chronic terror now just a chronic anxiety. Marginally better, but still better.

“So, are we ready? Ready to get on with our next destination?” I asked. Our plates now empty. I felt the energy from the food and coffee revitalize my body. Mostly from the coffee, though. Five cups of cheap coffee will do that to you.

“I’d never say that I’m ready, but it’s not like we have a choice, do we?” Dale said.

“You know what I mean.”

Dale pocketed Riley’s phone and stood up. “Alright, let’s go.” He sighed.

I followed behind him out into the parking lot. Unsure of what will be in store for us next.

1ohc7a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/transgenderUK/comments/1ohc7a1/things_to_try_if_you_cant_afford_therapy/,Things to try if you can’t afford therapy!,"I wanted to share a couple of ideas that I think will help you in these awful times.

Unfortunately, I haven’t had the money for therapy sessions in a while. I had a few sessions last year which were absolutely wonderful — I was lucky to find a brilliant, experienced, highly qualified therapist and it was probably the best investment of my life, I learnt so much from her!

Since then, I’ve been using what I learnt from her as well as finding other resources, and I just want to share a summary of what has helped me the most — and hopefully start a discussion of free or inexpensive resources to try!

To start with, these are mine…

**Write down your thoughts**
This is a brilliant way to process your emotions (for me, it’s been the most effective technique of all).
- **Write in the simplest language you can**, as a child would write. Emotions come from the deepest parts of your brain — higher-level thinking doesn’t need to get involved and may hinder progress. (If you’re as garrulous as me, this might take a bit of practise!).
- **Write for at least 20 minutes.** If you’re stuck, just write absolutely anything that comes to mind. It gets easier the more you practise and the more you discover about yourself.
- **Destroy what you’ve written!** Tearing it up and burning it afterwards is more satisfying and cathartic than you can possibly imagine.

**Manage your fight/flight/freeze response.** (This is to do with vagus nerve theory and the parasympathetic nervous system, if you’re interested to look it up.) If you’re scared, there are a few *great* ways to mitigate it and even overcome it for a while:
- **physical movement** — yoga is good, as are walks in nature. For me, there’s nothing better than dancing round the kitchen to good music! (N.B. Running can sometimes make it *worse* if your brain thinks you’re running away from something, so do be aware of this.)
- **Breathing techniques** – you can do this anywhere, any time: breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, breathe out for 4, hold for 4. Imagine the air filling the deepest part of your abdomen first. This engages your parasympathetic nervous system so it *will* make an immediate difference.
- **Observe what’s around you.** When you’re safe, look around you, physically moving your head. It helps you to get out of your own mind and to notice more beautiful things in the world.

**VODA app**
A therapy app designed by queer people for queer people. The name and design are pretty unexciting (which I think is deliberate so it doesn’t look or sound like a queer therapy app).
- It’s free!
- There’s a paid (~£50/year) version with AI help that’s actually quite good.
I got it to try it out, the free version is genuinely really useful.

**Come of social media and news sites** for as much time as you can. I accidentally logged out of everything last week and, to be honest, it was such a relief! I decided to leave it that way (I just logged into Reddit again to post this, in fact!). If you can go out and have a conversation with someone instead, do that! Have a friend round for coffee or go for a walk with someone. (Also: don’t use self-service checkouts.)

**Get news from the QueerAF newsletter** (their tagline is “Skip the doomscrolling”!). It’s *brilliant* journalism by queer people, and it’s more or less all you need to know about recent developments. It’s factually trustworthy, it’s got lots of interesting stuff, and I think they’re very good at giving you a sense of empowerment!

**Do something that feels like progress.**
I’m in a little queer group that has gatherings for games or reading to each other. Occasionally someone will arrange a burlesque night or an art event, it’s such a great little community!

When we heard about some communities organising meetings for businesses and queer people to tell local MPs *in person* how completely insane the new EHRC guidance is, so we’ve been arranging to do that as well! If it catches on around the country it could be a seriously powerful move.

I hope this information will be useful for those planning a trip to China. I’ve tried to list and describe as much as possible and highlighted some important parts. I’ve added AUD prices, the hotels that I stayed at, reviewed attractions that I visited in each city or town. Its my first time writing such a report and detailed itinerary so please be kind with the feedback. Feel free to ask questions and I will respond as soon as I can. Thanks for reading!

**ZHANGJIAJIE / WULINGYUAN for 5 nights.**

Day 2: Zhangjiajie National Park, top half / north section.
Day 3: Baofeng Lake, Huanglong Yellow Dragon Cave, Glass Bridge & Grand Canyon.
Day 4: Huangshizhai Yellow Stone Village & Golden Whip Stream then change to Zhangjiajie hotel, watched Fox Fairy Show.
Day 5: Tianmen Mountain, Line A & 72 Qilou.

**Please note: photos attached to this post are of the East Gate area, the cable car ride up to Tianzi Mountain and some of the lookout points in this area. I have made several media posts of photos for the other areas that I visited… I hope these photos will give people a better idea of what to expect, what they will see or could see (pending weather and time of the year), help people plan a suitable itinerary or to navigate around Zhangjiajie / Wulingyuan – without a guide.**


**DAY 1**

On Monday 1st September 2025, I caught a 3pm 2.5hr train from Chongqingdong (east) long-distance high-speed train station to Zhangjiajiexi (west) train station. I booked 2nd class seat for $46 AUD including the Trip.com booking fee. My guide had organised a driver to pick me up: he was waiting at the exit, with my name on a board. It took about 35min to get to my Wulingyuan hotel as there was no traffic. The weather was really warm, humid, stuffy (like 38 degrees at 8pm).

I stayed at **Yishu Yihua Inn for 3 nights = $92 AUD, including a simple, light Chinese breakfast.** The room was huge for one person. It had a seating area (table and chairs), wardrobe, wide clothes hanging rack, TV, air-con, bathroom with shower stand, sit-down toilet and a bathtub. There was a huge window with a view of the hotel next door. I booked this place on Trip.com and its a very popular choice for non-Chinese tourists. I had breakfast along with Americans, French, German, Indians, Singaporeans, Australians, etc. on the rooftop and it had a wonderful view of the area (see photo 1 attached). The hotel staff will communicate with you via WeChat, help you get laundry done (put clothes in washing machine then you hang dry yourself and collect when ready on the roof), find you a guide/driver if needed (I saw a group of European men having breakfast with me, then in the NP later that day, then at the hotel reception that night asking for a guide to take them around the NP tomorrow. People do get lost and confused visiting the NP without a guide, so research and plan your visit well) This hotel is located on a steep hill – it will take less than 5min to climb up / go down but I’m noting it in case you have the elderly and children travelling with you. **Its about 10-15min walk to **Xibu Street** from my hotel, a good place to go for meals – cafes, restaurants, food stalls, street vendors... grab snacks at a bakery, the fruit & vege store, stock up on drinks for the next few days as well – you can buy food / drinks in the NP but its more expensive and there’s not a huge selection (compared to Xibu Street). **


**DAY 2**

When I woke up around 7am and it was raining, heavily... for an hour. I thought about cancelling or changing the itinerary, but didn’t. When my guide picked me up at 8:20am, it wasn’t raining anymore but cloudy, foggy, misty. He drove to the **East Gate** (see photo 2 attached), about 5min from my hotel, parked in a huge multi-level lot, then we entered the NP. **We, tourists, scan our passports at the ticket gate, while guides show a pass and enter via a different gate.** We visited the following places (top half, north section of NP) and in this order (I’m going by memory and my photos):

**Tianzi Mountain & cable car** We caught a shuttle bus to the **Lower Cable Car Station**, then rode the cable car up the Mountain. I saw nothing but clouds, fog, mist etc (See photo 6 for the cable car and photo 7 for the view in the cable car, attached).

**Helong Park** This is the closest viewing point from the **Upper Cable Car Station**, where you get off the cable car. There are toilets here, some street food vendors, McDonald's and Luckin Coffee. We arrived around 9:30am and it was still cloudy, foggy, misty (see photo 9 & 11 attached). This is one of my guides favourite viewing spots: **Flower Fairy Peaks or Fairy Dispersing Flowers (names are different on site and maps), opposite Imperial Writing Brush Peaks**. We waited for 15mins to see if the sky would clear up – it didn’t. We walked to a number of different viewing points such as **Tianzi Pavilion**, **Turtle Rock** and **a sightseeing platform** (as noted on some maps LOL). We returned to this area around 5pm and we had great views especially from Flower Fairy Peaks (see photo 12 and compare it with photo 11 attached).

**Bailong Elevator** Next, we caught a shuttle bus to the **Upper Station of Bailong Elevator**. By the time we reached here, around 11am, the clouds, mist, fog, had completely disappeared! I was so glad that I didn’t cancel or change the itinerary. The weather “ruined” about 3 hours of the day, but then again, I got to see a dreamy, eerie side of the mountains so it wasn’t too bad. We went on the Bailong Elevator twice: up and down. I waited less than 5min to get on, both times. I think its overrated but while you’re here, definitely do it – tick it off the list. **I’ve made a separate post with photos about the Bailong Elevator..**

**Hallelujah / Avatar Mountain** FYI, I’m not a nature person – I’m a city girl... but when I got here, wow! I can see why people love it so much and are willing to travel so far to be here. There’s something about this place. Its truly a sight a behold. A real natural wonder. Photos really don’t do it justice! You need to stand on the platform and walk to the edge of the cliff, look out, look down, look around, to really see it for yourself, to understand and appreciate it. You can pay to have a drone take photos of you and a short video of you here – I didn’t, but there were many visitors who did. Around this area, are viewing points such as **Stone Pillar Supporting Heaven**, **Enchanting Platform** and **Ladder to Heaven**. **Please note: not every one of these viewpoints are on the same map or with the same name, hence its confusing to know where to go for the best views or figure out where you are on a map. The only way that I know where I was, is because, I took photos of the big rocks with the location name: in Chinese and English, checked and compared with several different online maps to figure it out.** Anyways, somewhere along the way, you should then come across **The Long-Life Pond**: a pond filled with turtles and surrounded by snack stalls and drink vendors (see photo 16 attached). I arrived here around 12:45pm and took a break...

**Worlds’ No.1 Bridge** This is one of my favourite sections of the NP. I think, if you come all the way here and don’t visit this bridge then its a really big shame. **I’ve made a separate post with photos of the Worlds’ No. 1 Bridge with Shetang Gulf.** I paid 10 yuan per red ribbon (I bought x3), wrote my name on each and tied them to a tree branch. The red ribbons have different meanings and wishes like for love, health, wealth, family, career etc. If there was a cafe here, I would sit and admire the views for hours!

We continued walking along and dropped by many lookout points such as **Huang Jiadeng Formation**, **Ape-man Looking at the Moon**, **The Thousand-metre Cliff**, and **Waiting Bridge-Terrace** (wow). Then, we caught a shuttle bus and my guide spoke to the driver to drop us off somewhere along the way: there was no bus stop or bus station where he wanted to take me. The views on the shuttle bus ride were also amazing (see last photo attached, a tea paddy terrace?) – I wasn’t expecting to see this and was so glad I snapped a photo – fast! We got off the bus then walked about 10min down a pathway to **Shetang Gulf** (wow wow wow). We arrived here around 3:30pm; there was no one here and it made my visit even more special. I listened to one of my favourite songs here, on speaker, as I admired the view… I was very happy that my guide took me here! He said, we had time as I’m a fast walker (but I’m a slow stair climber) and it depended on whether the shuttle bus driver would stop here for us. We visited **The Commander’s Platform** and ** Arranging Battles Platform** (where you can see a pagoda type building in the distance): both were awesome viewpoints as you get a wonderful panoramic view of the mountains, rocks formations, threes, valleys in the distance. After a short break, we headed back up to the main road and walked 10min to an empty restaurant (no one was here but staff). We waited, a few minutes, waved for a small 16-seater van (it wasn’t the shuttle bus) to pick us up and take us to the next stop. I think the majority of tourists skip this area of the NP. **If you can make the time to get Shetang Gulf, please do – its 110% worth it. If you’ve been here, please tell me what you think, your experience!**

The next lot of viewing points were **Sandstone Peak Forest**, **Stone Peak Forest**, **Yunqing Rock** (wow) and back to *Flower Fairy Peaks or Fairy Dispersing Flowers, opposite Imperial Writing Brush Peaks in Helong Park.** We got here around 5pm, and had clearer views compared to the morning visit (see photo 12 and compare it with photo 11 attached). We also stopped by **a small art gallery room** (near Luckin Coffee), which I recommend to visit for 10min. It showcases a local famous artist named Lijinsheng who uses sand to create his paintings of the Avatar Mountains. We caught the cable car down (I had views unlike the ride up, yay!) and headed out of the NP by 6pm. My guide dropped me off at my hotel, I had a quick shower then walked to Xibu Street for dinner.


**DAY 3**

My guide picked me up around 8:30am. First stop was **Baofeng Lake**. As many others have mentioned here on Reddit, skip it – unless you have time. I spent about an hour here. It wasn’t amazing but it wasn’t terrible either. I didn’t mind visiting here as I knew what to expect and I thought seeing the mountains: rock formations and trees along the water, was a nice change of scenery. **I’ve made a separate post with photos of Baofeng Lake.** There’s toilets near the ticket office, some cafes, restaurants and souvenir type shops etc You need to catch a 5min shuttle bus from here (near the toilet block) to take you to the dock / pier, where the boats are. Each wooden boat holds about 30 people, and you sit anywhere you want. When I was here, I shared the boat with a group of Japanese tourists and their guide. There’s life jackets, on a rack above your head, but no one wears them. Its a slow, relaxing 25min around the lake. You will see some fishermen, birds, a few people singing Chinese songs on the water pavilions and the same type of mountains (rocks and trees like around the Avatar Mountains but from a different angle, you’re looking up, and surrounded by water instead).

Once we got off the boat ride, my guide escorted me: about 10min walk, to a waterfall with a bridge (see photo 20 of Baofeng Lake post), and where the Chinese giant salamanders were kept in a pond (see photo 18 & 19 of Baofeng Lake post). This was a cool, 15min stop as I haven’t seen Chinese giant salamanders before, then we headed back on the 5min shuttle bus to make our way out and to my guide’s car.

Roughly 20mins later, we arrived at **Huanglongdong Scenic Area / Yellow Dragon Cave**. I really enjoyed my 2hr-3hr visit here. Perhaps, its because this was my first cave visit in China, or because of all the colourful lights, or how cool (temperature wise) it was inside. If you have time, I highly recommend coming here! **I’ve made a separate post with photos of Yellow Dragon Cave.** There’s only one route to follow and you walk along flat footpaths, climb stairs and go through some wet areas (water dripping from the cave roof), so please wear comfy, good grip-soled shoes. You also go on a 10min boat ride through a dark cave area as well. There’s a few small museum-like exhibits of different rocks, a jewellery and art stone shop, opportunity to get professional photos taken with the gold dragon throne (see photo 19 of Yellow Dragon Cave post). The tallest, highest, longest stalagmite is 19.2m and has been insured for 100 million RMB / CNY (see photo 11 of Yellow Dragon Cave post).

The entrance / exit to Yellow Dragon Cave is about a 15min walk through a rice paddy field, some restaurants, cafes and stall vendor centre near the car-park. Across the street are more restaurants, cafes and some hotels. I didn’t see (or notice) any taxis, or DiDi’s here. I don’t think many people make the time, or have the time, to visit Yellow Dragon Cave and its unfortunate. We had lunch, some traditional Hunan province dishes at a local restaurant across the street from the car-park, then went to the next attraction.

There were a lot more people at **The Glass Bridge & Grand Canyon**, compared to the Yellow Dragon Cave. Near the car-park, are restaurants, toilets and the 5min shuttle bus to take you to the Glass Bridge entrance. **I’ve made a separate post with photos of the Glass Bridge & Grand Canyon with ticket prices and a map. Note: you can buy combined entry tickets to both attractions, or just one, and choose to participate in x5 different activities: x1 60 second zip-line, x2 (5min each) slides, x1 5min VR reality experience, x2 10min boat rides at the bottom of the Grand Canyon (which you need to take if you want to exit faster to the car park or you will have to back-track and exit via the shuttle bus). You can also bungee-jump here (see photo 9 of the Glass Bridge & Grand Canyon post), go rock climbing or rail climbing** and I saw many foreigners line up for this.

**To walk across the Glass Bridge, you’re provided with a pair of burgundy-red fabric slippers to wear over your shoes.** I found it quite daunting going across this bridge – I have vertigo. My guide had to patiently coax me to sit down on the glass, reassure me its safe and secure, to take photos of me on the bridge. I was getting jelly legs here! The views on the right side of the glass bridge is just mountains covered with trees, while the left side is of the elevator (like Bailong Elevator but smaller / shorter), the zip-line and the Rainbow Lake below. When you look down through the glass bridge, you will see trees, a dried up part of the canyon river and the bungee-jump ropes – I did watch someone bungee-jump and heard that person scream! There's toilets, massage chairs, a restaurant and souvenir shop waiting for you at the other end of the glass bridge. **To get to the zip-line, you exit the building, turn right and climb a flight of stairs through bushes. Note: you need to weigh less than 90kgs to go on the zip-line (I think this includes your bag, which is placed in your lap as you zip-line across the canyon). ** I didn’t find the zip-line very exciting. It’s less than 60 secs to get across and you get the same view like you’re standing on the Glass bridge – you’re zip-lining parallel (alongside) to the Glass Bridge (see photo 15 of Glass Bridge & Grand Canyon post).

I really enjoyed the x2 (5min each) slides! They were the highlight of the Grand Canyon visit for me! You have to wear these fabric pants over your clothes, sit on the metal slide with your bag in your lap and use your hands on the railing to brake and your feet to control the speed. There were lots of corners and steep sections (not crazy steep) so it was a lot of fun. I was laughing and smiling – I felt like I was 5 years old again! If I could, I would go on these slides again and again and again! Anyways, the entry point of the first slide is also where you can do the rail climbing. When I was there, around 3pm, there was a queue of about 10 foreigners waiting to be suited up for it. Once you reach the bottom of the x2 slides, you will see a Chinese fast food burger joint, toilets and its where you start the Grand Canyon walk. **Now, if you choose not to do any of the x5 activities – you didn’t buy these tickets, I believe you walk down a huge flight of stairs from the Glass Bridge to the Grand Canyon instead.**

I think, it takes about 1.5hr to walk the full length of the Grand Canyon (the part that’s open to the public). It was very cool (temperature wise), there’s a lot of shade (sun doesn’t reach down here), and it was peaceful except for the birds and some ducks in the Rainbow Lake. I saw around 30 people walking along the bottom of the Grand Canyon – it’s not packed or crowded like the Avatar Mountains which made my time here enjoyable and relaxing. To continue your way through the whole Grand Canyon and to the exit – where the car-park is, you need to jump on x2 10min boat rides. Depending on how many people are here and the time of day, you might have to wait up to 30min before the boat departs as the staff want to fill up the boat. We were lucky and only waited a few min, both times. Once you get off the 2nd boat, you have to climb a huge flight of stairs (bloody hell), walk pass a block of abandoned shops and restaurants, then go through a fully operational and well-staffed block of shops and restaurants, to get to the car-park. **If you don’t complete the full walk of the Grand Canyon which leads you to the exit / car-park, I think you have to climb up a flight of stairs back to the Glass Bridge entrance to catch the 5min shuttle bus to take you back to the car-park area. Like, you do everything in reverse… If you can, do the full walk of the Grand Canyon – its an easy stroll and so you don’t waste time, back-tracking.**

We got to the car-park after 5pm and it was empty: there were only a few cars left. A lady approached us and asked my guide and he had seen these two foreigners (she showed photos), as she has been waiting for them for hours… Hmm, hope those tourists didn’t get lost. The area is safe but there aren’t many people around here, not like the Avatar Mountains. I saw a few Chinese men offer a few tourists a ride in their cars and they, of course, politely declined and said they were calling a DiDi. I don’t know how long they waited for a DiDi but I was really glad my guide drove. He dropped me off at my hotel before 6pm. I had a shower then went looking for dinner around Xibu Street.


**DAY 4**

Today, I was picked up by my guide by 8:15am and he drove me along a scenic route to the **West Gate of the NP**. He stopped at a few lookout points along the way then drove back to the **South Gate of the NP**. After he parked the car, toilet stop, we entered the NP and headed to the **Big Oxygen Square**. Now, the Big Oxygen Square area is flat, with a few steps here and there… You will see on the right side, a small platform area to take photos looking up at the mountains, a **big ‘I Love Zhangjiajie’ sign** (see photo 3 in Huangshizhai post) and a huge heart-shaped padlock that you can take photos with, a pond with a wooden bridge walkway (see photo 5 in Huangshizhai post), a cafe, a few benches etc, its a nice area to hang around.

Opposite the cafe, a 5min walk, there’s the cable car station. We caught the cable car (see photo 6 & 7 in Huangshizhai post) up to **Huangshizhai = Yellow Stone Village and completed the full loop, its approx 2hr walk but give yourself 3hr to include snack breaks, toilet stops, queuing at the popular viewpoints to take photos, time to watch the monkeys, etc.** We wandered along the wooden planked walkway route from the far left side, went clock-wise, and stopped at the following viewpoints (as written on the big rocks at each area): **Zhang Liang’s Tactical Formation**, **Armour Peak,** crossed a short suspension bridge (see photo 13 in Huangshizhai post), **Philosophic Theory Thinking** (yes, that’s what was written on the big rock!), **Sword to the Sky**, **Huangshi Pine** (massive tree with a tiny platform viewing area), **Imperial Garden**, **Lover’s Peak** (with red Chinese writing on the staircase that leads to its platform viewing area, see photo 15 in Huangshizhai post), then we came across the **Chinese Herbal Medicine Corridor** (dozen type of plants grown here among flowers), continued exploring to **Greeting Double Gate**, **Jiuchong Pavilion** which is next to a cluster of cafes, restaurants and toilet block, and **Immortals’ Peak**… We stopped for lunch at the Cable Car Station area before heading back down via the cable car and back to the **Big Oxygen Square**.

As you walk towards the cafe, turn left for the **Golden Whip Stream**. You’ll cross a small stone bridge and should see people below in the stream, playing in the water, barefoot. Some visitors also had their dogs here too. Its a lot cooler around here (temperature wise), compared to Huangshizhai. You’ll pass a few cafes, restaurants, trinket stalls etc before you start the actual walk of the Golden Whip Stream. The footpath changes as you wander further along, from walking under a canopy of trees to a flat concrete footpath, then into dirt ground area, then into stone / gravel sections and wooden-planked platforms, etc. There are a few big, cute animal figures randomly placed along here, stone art displays, I saw a “learn CPR information board” (see photo 5 in Golden Whip Stream post, so random!), wooden seats for break time, bridges to cross… **There’s an 8min video clip of a really old Journey to the West movie played on a screen about half-way through the Golden Whip Stream** (see photo 13 & 14 in Golden Whip Stream post). And, of course, there’s lots of monkeys around here that are not afraid to approach you for food. I didn’t see anyone get attacked but its not unheard of, so be careful as you wander around here. My guide used his umbrella to shoo the monkeys away for me!

**Many people walked from the Golden Whip Stream to the Lower Station of Bailong Elevator – I think it will take about 3hrs, one way. I didn’t walked all the way. We turned back around 2:30pm (I hate back-tracking but we need to get to my guide’s car) and exited the NP via the South Gate by 3pm. NOTE: If I were to revisit this NP, I would skip Huangshizhai and the Golden Whip Stream. If you don’t have a lot of time, I suggest to skip it. I recommend to spend one full day at the top half, north end, of the NP: visit Tianzi Mountain, Yuangjiajie, Bailong Elevator, World’s No.1 Bridge... The main reason that I decided to visit this part of the NP is to see where Journey of the West was filmed as I’m a fan of Sun Wukong – it was cool but not worth revisiting.**

My guide drove me to Zhangjiajie and he dropped me off before 4pm at the **Ika Style Hotel = 2 night stay for $85 AUD**. This hotel is inside a huge building that houses many hotels – one hotel per floor, and there's restaurants on the street level. Its located on a main road and about 5min walk to the Tianmen Mountain Cable Car entrance, also where Luckin Coffee and McDonald's are (if you need a break from Chinese food). The hotel room that I booked had a view of the city, Tianmen Mountain cable car line and mountain backdrop. It was well decorated, had everything that I needed for a comfortable stay and I could get some laundry done, for free too. **I recommend this hotel or any around this area for convenience to get to Tianmen Mountain Cable Car entrance.**

A few hours later, after I had unpacked, showered, ate dinner at one of the restaurants below my hotel, my guide picked me up and drove me to the **Fox Fairy Show**. I really enjoyed it. It has English subtitles but was hard to read and watch the show at the same time, as the outdoor stage is huge and wide. It was also difficult to take photos. I think this show is worth watching, once. Many foreigners were here. You can catch a DiDi to the show and there are many taxis waiting in the car-park to take you back to your hotel, after the show finishes.


** DAY 5**
I visited Tianmen Mountain and I’ve made a separate post so I can attached photos to make it easier for readers to follow with my route.

Thanks for reading! I hope this is useful….

1ohc4w8,https://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/1ohc4w8/best_coworking_spaces_for_their_communities/,Best coworking spaces for their communities,"I've seen several posts here asking for recommendations on the most affordable coworking spaces in Boulder. But I'd like to focus on the best coworking spaces for their communities, regardless of price. 

A little background, I moved out to Boulder in 2014 and worked from Galvanize when it was on the top floor of the West End Plaza on Pearl. They had a very large open space in the middle with an outdoor deck with beautiful views of the mountains. There were always 2 beer kegs in the kitchen that seemed to encourage people to mingle in the middle of the work day. There were always a lot of community events that they put on every week, and the space was usually pretty active during the day. It had so much energy, and I met a lot of people there, some of which I'm still good friends with.

I left Boulder several years ago, but just recently returned. It doesn't feel the same at all. I know it's not a controversial opinion to say Boulder isn't what it used to be, whether you're nostalgic for 30 years ago, 20 years ago, or 10 years ago. But it really seems now like all the energy has been sucked out, particularly from coworking spaces. I want to be proven wrong. 

It's very isolating as someone who works remotely to just always work out of your living room. And going to coffee shops is fine, but you don't get to meet people that you know will be there tomorrow or the next day. 

I checked out the new Galvanize on Walnut and it absolutely sucks. It's dreary, has no atmosphere, and nobody is ever there. I've checked out WeWork, and they have a pretty massive space but nobody is there. I checked out Spaces, and it's a pretty nice space but nobody is there. I spent a week when I moved back, looking at random coworking spaces, and they all seemed to have the same problem. They're completely empty. And that kind of defeats the purpose of a coworking space in my opinion.

Are there any coworking spaces that have a vibrant community and has a community manager that actually puts on regular fun events to bring a crowd? ",2,1761565391.0,boulder,1,1.0,False

1ohc4fi,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarTrekGermany/comments/1ohc4fi/my_2025_iptv_provider_ranking_latenight_streams/,"My 2025 IPTV Provider Ranking: Late-Night Streams, Too Much Coffee, and a Few Surprises","If you’re anything like me, you’ve probably spent way too many evenings with a mug of coffee, scrolling through endless channels in search of something new. After another year of experimenting with the [**best iptv providers**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/), I thought I’d share my honest ranking for [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/). From US sports to UK comedies and EU news, here’s how my favorites lined up this year.

# 1. [IPTVMEEZZY](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptv_provider_2025/wiki/index/)

* **Price:** $16/month (discounts for annual plans)
* **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (massive selection: US, UK, CA, EU and more)
* **Smoothness:** 9/10 (I rarely saw buffering, even when streaming US football and UK documentaries back-to-back)
* **Firestick Friendly:** Set up was quick and painless on my **iptv firestick**
* **My Experience:** I actually stumbled on IPTVMEEZZY through a friend who’s an **iptv reseller** and suggested I try the **free trial**. It handled everything I threw at it—Canadian morning news, EU sports streams, and a bunch of American sitcoms. The interface is straightforward, and even during major live events, the connection held up impressively well.

# 2. HorizonWave TV

* **Price:** $15/month
* **Channels:** 32,500+ live, 108,000+ VOD (heaviest on US/UK, but solid CA/EU coverage)
* **Smoothness:** 8/10 (smooth most of the time, but the odd hiccup during big US sports nights)
* **Firestick Friendly:** No issues at all on my **iptv firestick**
* **My Experience:** HorizonWave TV was an unexpected winner for me. The **free trial** made it easy to test out, and I found myself digging into more UK reality shows and European news than usual. The EPG is simple to navigate, and channel switching is quick. Just a little buffering on Super Bowl Sunday, but nothing major.

# 3. EuroStream Select

* **Price:** $14/month
* **Channels:** 26,000+ live, 89,000+ VOD (EU and UK focus, but plenty from US/CA too)
* **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (great for VOD, a little lag on huge EU sports nights)
* **Firestick Friendly:** Worked right away with my **iptv firestick**
* **My Experience:** EuroStream Select is my go-to for late-night European movies and British comedies. I was pleasantly surprised by the range of French and German channels. Most of the time, streams are crisp, but when there’s a big football final, you might notice some stutter.

# 4. MaplePrime IPTV

* **Price:** $13/month
* **Channels:** 18,000+ live, 57,000+ VOD (strong Canadian and US mix, all major UK/EU basics)
* **Smoothness:** 7/10 (ideal for day-to-day viewing, but live events can slow things down)
* **Firestick Friendly:** No trouble on my **iptv firestick**
* **My Experience:** MaplePrime is perfect for background TV—Canadian news during breakfast, US talk shows in the evening. The **free trial** was easy to set up, and the interface is straightforward. It’s not the flashiest, but it gets the job done for everyday streaming.

# What I’ve Learned About IPTV in 2025

* **Always, always start with the free trial**—real-world testing is key.
* Even the **top rated iptv** options can stutter during massive live events, especially in the US or EU.
* I usually end up sticking with my core dozen channels, no matter how big the list is.
* Using an **iptv firestick** keeps things simple (and saves me from tech headaches).
* If you’re considering being an **iptv reseller**, get ready for lots of late-night troubleshooting texts from friends.

Wherever you are—US, UK, CA, EU—the best IPTV service is the one that fits your habits and keeps your coffee warm. If you find a hidden gem, let me know. Until then, I’ll be surfing channels and drinking way too much coffee.",1,1761565347.0,StarTrekGermany,0,1.0,False

1ohc47x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ohc47x/aio_for_thinking_i_maight_be_in_a_toxic/,AIO for thinking I maight be in a toxic relationship?,"I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for two years. I’ve walked her through a massive breakup with her abusive ex and stopped her from trying to take her own life. She agreed to go to a psychiatric emergency, but when I and one of our friends took her there, she called me a fucking bitch who betrayed her. I understood, because this is really hard for some people. I was willing to be her punching bag if it meant that she’s gonna get the help she needed. I was there through all the breakdowns and tried everything I could to make her feel better, to make her feel safe. I listened and acted on what she said would help her. I really tried to give her everything she never got the chance to have. (Here I want to say that I have ADHD, I am autistic and have a hard time picking up on social cues and I also am medicated for depression and anxiety.) Still I tried my best.

I was trying to make her feel better by even buying small things like her favorite coffee, even when I knew I didn’t have enough money to do that and eat at the same period of time. When she was yelling at me I thought that it is just some defense mechanism and took it as it was. I knew life was really hard on her.

When we moved together in the dorms, she started changing things, but maybe it was for the better, because my chaos became less chaotic. She was mostly nice and kind. Sometimes she called me stupid when I was being silly, but it was okay since it made her laugh. Then came the „harmless“ comments about my inteligence. I am aware that I am not the smartest person alive, but I didn’t think it was that big of a deal (I got into university so I cannot be that dumb or...). I tried to show otherwise, but there was always something. I loved her and if it made her feel better I let it go.

During that time, she always managed to find someone, she tol dme she loved and wanted to have something with. (Should have been a massive redflag given to that we were in a relationship. But again I loved her and excused it.) Another redflag should have been when I stopped doing what I like and keeping it to myself, when she told me to stop doing it because I cannot do it properly. And it again spiraled to me being stupid and not being able to do anything properly.

As I tried lifting her confidence and selfesteem, mine were collapsing. I respected her boudaries to the point I stopped respecting myself.

Then she broke up with me during the summer holiday and went for the friend mentioned at the beginning. But at this time nothing much changed between us.

After the summer break we went to study abroad together (we couldn’t cancel it at that time). She asked me then if we could get back together because she made a mistake. And again because I still loved her I agreed. At this point I think I was actually stupid af. Soon it all got back to the same track. And got progrsively worse. Everything I did or didn’t do was pissing her off. I tried to change myself because it could make things better, right? It did not. It made me more distant from everyone else and I ended up alone in foreign country. Everyone saw me as the moody, angry bitch noone wants to be around, while she was the sunny, emphatethic girl with traumatic backstory. She was the girl who went through hell and stood confidentaly after. I was fighting my battles alone alongside hers. Everything around me started collapsing and in the middle of the ruins she stood with confidence of a supermodel signing massive deal.

When we got back home, I went back to the dorms while she stayed at home (she didn’t have any more classes she needed to attend personaly). Things were a bit better. From that day whenewer she was talking or comlaining about her job or school work I listened and tried my best to lift her up. But when I try to talk about something she cuts me of and tells me she doesn’t care and it is annoying. I keep everything to myself at this point. I helped with her thesis and field work which took me hours to get through, but when I asked for little help, she didn’t have time for it. Even few minutes was too much to ask.

No idea if I am too much or not enough for her.

Fast forward I moved in with her this month, because I still love her after all. I don’t have a job at this exact point, because I moved across half a country, so I at least do housework and I brought a lot of food with me. I really thought it would be enough for this month before I could go to work. Paperwork takes so long here, so I basically have a job, but I cannot go. But still everything I do or don’t do is wrong and I don’t know what else can I do.

When I am away she calls me with „I miss you, come back“, but when I do, I am just the punching bag again. Everything has to be how she imagines it. She calls me „money-eating“ even tho most expences go on her. I respect her wishes to not touch her in intimate way, but she doesn’t respect any of my little wishes. Like when I told her that sometimes I just want to cuddle and not be tickled or poked all the time and she cried and told me it is her way of showing love. But is it really? When I am sometimes reasonably upset about something (like when my pet rabbit died) I am a crybaby, I get yelled at, laugh at and get a lecture. She doesn’t communicate, she lectures and I am talking back. Sometimes I just need a hug or a kind word. Could I actually be that worthless to not deserve that?

She used to let me hug her, kiss her or hold her hand. Now it is only „ew“, „you’re annoying“ or something other like that. Also said she sometimes feels like hitting me. And not just when I ask about something (mostly social rules and why are they like that) that she thinks is primitive and everyone is supposed to know that. She tells me, she’s helping me, but I feel worse and more lost after.

I am an adult but here I feel like I am not even 5. Could it change when I actually go to work? Could I be just overthinking this? I am confused and don’t know what to do now. I feel like I am in the wrong here.

I didn’t plan to stay long in Dali.

But the first time I stood by Erhai Lake at sunset, I understood why people never leave.



The wind here isn’t cold, it feels alive.

It rushes through your hair, your clothes, your thoughts,

until you forget where you were trying to go.



Every evening, the sky turns gold,

and the water mirrors the light like melted metal.

Locals just sit by the shore, chatting,

some holding coffee, some holding nothing, just time.



If you’re coming to Dali, here’s what I’d tell you:

🌬 Best sunset spot: Caicun Wharf or Longkan Wharf, fewer tourists, closer to the lake.

🚴 Rent a bike: cycling around Erhai takes a day, but it’s worth every minute.

☕ Morning coffee: go to Yuechao Coffee or Xizhou Courtyard Café, both have views and quiet.

🏡 Where to stay: try a small B&B near Shuanglang or Caicun, not inside the ancient town.

🕯 Best time: 5–7 p.m. when the lake glows and the air turns soft.

## 📊 COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS



#### SEC Filing Analysis: Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (KDP)

#### Executive Summary

- **Trading Significance**: High
- **Key Takeaway**: Keurig Dr Pepper announced a $7 billion strategic investment from Apollo and KKR to finance its acquisition of JDE Peet's and subsequent plan to separate into two independent public companies.
- **Market Impact**: This is a highly material event, representing 18.7% of the company's market cap. It provides a clear financing path for a transformational corporate restructuring, which could reduce market uncertainty.

#### Company Information

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Company | Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. |
| Ticker Symbol | KDP |
| CIK | 0001418135 |
| Industry | Beverages |

#### Insider Information

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | null |
| CIK | null |
| Title/Position | null |
| Relationship | null |

#### Transaction Details

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Form Type | 8-K |
| Transaction Date | 2025-10-27 |
| Transaction Code | null |
| Security Type | Convertible Preferred Stock & Joint Venture Investment |
| Shares Involved | null |
| Price Per Share | null |
| Total Value | $7,000,000,000 |
| Shares Owned After | null |
| Ownership Type | null |

#### Financial Impact Assessment

#### Transaction Materiality

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Transaction Value | $7,000,000,000 |
| % of Market Cap | 18.71% |
| Shares Transacted | Not applicable (corporate financing) |
| % of Shares Outstanding | Not applicable |
| Post-Transaction Ownership | Not applicable |
| Materiality Assessment | Highly Significant |

#### Impact Evaluation

- **Market Cap Context**: For a large-cap company with a $37.42 billion market capitalization, a $7 billion capital event is exceptionally large and transformative. It fundamentally alters the company's capital structure and strategic direction.
- **Ownership Concentration**: The transaction introduces major institutional investors (Apollo, KKR) as significant stakeholders through a $3 billion convertible preferred stock instrument, which has a conversion price premium, indicating confidence in future value.
- **Dilution Impact**: The convertible preferred stock has a conversion price of $37.25. If fully converted, it would introduce approximately 80.5 million new shares, representing a potential future dilution of ~5.9% against current shares outstanding. This is a material but long-term consideration.
- **Transaction Significance**: A transaction value equivalent to over 18% of the company's market cap is far above the 1% threshold for high significance. This is a major corporate event that will be closely watched by the market.

#### Market Impact Analysis

#### Stock Impact Prediction

- **Direction**: Neutral to Positive
- **Reasoning**: The filing provides a clear and robust financing plan for a previously announced, complex acquisition and separation. The backing by prominent firms like Apollo and KKR lends credibility. While the complexity of the deal may create some overhang, the reduction in financing uncertainty is a net positive.

#### Volume & Sentiment

- **Expected Volume Impact**: High. News of this magnitude is expected to drive significant trading volume as institutions and analysts digest the details of the new capital structure and strategic plan.
- **Sentiment Indicator**: Bullish. The announcement signals strong institutional backing for KDP's strategic direction and provides a clear path to executing a value-creation plan through the separation of its coffee and beverage businesses.

#### Investment Insights

#### Positive Market Indicators

- Strong financial backing from top-tier private equity firms.
- Clear strategic plan to unlock value by creating two focused companies.
- The financing structure is designed to strengthen the balance sheet and maintain an investment-grade profile.

#### Risk Factors

- Execution risk associated with a large-scale acquisition, integration, and subsequent corporate separation.
- Potential for future shareholder dilution from the convertible preferred stock.
- Complexity of the joint venture and preferred stock agreements may be difficult for retail investors to fully assess.

#### Key Takeaways

1. **Massive Strategic Shift**: KDP is undergoing a fundamental transformation, not just an acquisition. The end goal is two separate, specialized public companies.
2. **Major PE Endorsement**: The $7 billion investment from Apollo and KKR is a significant vote of confidence in both the current management and the future value of the separated businesses.
3. **Significant Capital Event**: The scale of the financing (18.7% of market cap) underscores the magnitude of this transaction and its importance to KDP's future.

#### Additional Context

#### Transaction Notes

- **Purpose**: The capital is explicitly to finance the acquisition of JDE Peet's, reduce leverage, and support the eventual separation of the business units.
- **Structure**: The financing is complex, involving both a joint venture and a convertible instrument, providing capital while giving KDP operational control and a defined cost of capital.

For now pineapple farmed coffee and monsoon malabar is my go to beans. But I keep seeing these barrel aged coffees popping up. Whether it's wine or whiskey oak or rum barrels. I have smelt them and they smell really really good. I like the funkyness and the oakiness of those aromas. But they cost like twice the price of a good arabica roast. 

Are they worth the price. 
I keep telling myself to buy it the next salary day but I am just not sure.

Is there an existing group for women in our 30s?Let me join! Haha.

I'm finally at a point where I have the flexibility to get out and be more active on the weekends. I'm open to trying anything new, things like playing tennis, badminton, running, hiking, camping. Or just hangout like drink coffees and etc.

TOI just dropped this .../ phd admissions falling in US, funding cut, intl students not even showing up anymore. like… how u call urself global leader in STEM when ur own labs can’t afford students 😭

these unis (MIT, Harvard, etc) literally said they reducing phd seats cause money low. and if u international? good luck. u pay like crazy, live off coffee, and pray ur visa don’t expire mid-research.

it’s not even hate, it’s exhaustion.  
america acting like students still dying to come. nah. europe out here giving free masters, china throwing new K visa for grads, australia flexing work hours. everyone adapting ..///// except US.

and bro the housing part? nightmare. ppl sleeping on couches, fb marketplace scams everywhere. no wonder stuff like *University Living* even exist .../ cause students literally running outta safe options.

maybe it’s not downfall. maybe it’s just students finally saying “nah, i’m done being broke in ur dreamland.

I built a small project called [**HowMuchISave.com**](https://howmuchisave.com) — it helps people see **how much they could save** if they skip small daily expenses like coffee, snacks, or cigarettes.

For example:  
☕ $3 coffee × 30 days = $90 saved  
🚬 $5 cigarettes × 30 days = $150 saved

It’s super simple — just enter the price, how often you buy it, and it shows your total savings.

But here’s my question:  
👉 **What would make** ***you*** **actually click and try a site like this?**

Would it be:

* A fun challenge or savings goal tracker?
* A clean design and fast experience?
* Social media posts or short videos?
* Something else completely?

I’d love your honest feedback — I’m trying to make it more useful and interesting without overcomplicating it 🙏",1,1761564655.0,StartupLaunches,0,1.0,False

After querying 18 agents and getting one full request that turned into a form rejection, I rewrote my query letter and manuscript from scratch. I would love to hear your thoughts on the new (and hopefully improved) version.

...

Query:

*How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days* meets *Fleabag* in HOW TO SHARE A BYLINE, a 70,000-word contemporary romance. Come for the newsroom rivals-to-lovers plot (à la *Cover Story* by Mhairi McFarlane), stay for the voice-y heroine (*Romantic Comedy* by Curtis Sittenfeld).

Ellie Masters has been churning out brainless thinkpieces at The London Fox for over a decade. Frankly, she’s over it. When she gets a tip that there’s a scandal brewing at Circle, the City’s sexiest start-up, she sees a chance to grow as a journalist – and secure her job from impending layoffs. Until her editor assigns her least favorite coworker to help investigate, that is.

Alfie Argento is a posh playboy business journalist who spends half his workday on coffee breaks and the other half flirting. When Ellie lets slip that she’s investigating Circle, a company he recently profiled, he wrangles his way onto the assignment. To protect his reputation, get closer to a cute colleague, or impress his famous (and famously critical) mother? Why not all three?

Over one hot London summer, Ellie and Alfie compete – er, collaborate – on the story. When Ellie finds a key source, Alfie crashes the interview. While Alfie digs for a new lead, Ellie finds a different one – and goes straight to their editor to take sole credit. But after one too many pints at work drinks, their enmity tilts into chemistry. Soon, they’re not just fighting over the story. They’re fighting their feelings for each other. With their jobs on the line, will these journalists find the words to write their happy ending?

\[BIO, THANK YOU, ETC.\]

...

First 300:

Nestled inside the heart of every journalist, there is a little timer, ticking down to the next deadline. I had been a culture writer at *The London Fox* for over ten years. So I knew, as sure as I knew my heart was beating, that it was pitch day. The first Monday of July. 8:42 am. I had exactly 33 minutes to come up with a story.

“What if I did, like, *How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,* but feminist?”

“What’s that? Reality TV?”

I looked up from my tea-stained notebook. Emma, my usual waitress, sometime-idea-bouncer-off-er, looked blankly back at me.

“Romcom. Journalist fakes a bad relationship, falls in love anyway? Matthew McConaughey? Kate Hudson?”

Emma shrugged with such veteran grace that the cups of tea on her tray hardly shifted. “I prefer documentaries.”

“It’s iconic,” I said.

“So you would fake a relationship with some guy and write about it?”

I nodded.

In Y2K-era chick flicks, journalists always seemed to be improbably hot women balancing love, work, and excellent wardrobes. They never worried about the decline of print media or whether they ought to jump ship for a higher-paying job in PR. Perhaps if I’d watched different films, I would have chosen a different career.

“I don’t really see how you could make that feminist,” she said, and left to drop the tea off at the next table.

A bell dinged. Emma bustled behind the till to pick up a tray of – well, it looked like mostly sausages. The air filled with the smell of hot dead fat. My nose wrinkled. Emma deposited the sausages at a table of builders.

“Oh, here’s an idea!” I spread my palm through the air, envisioning my invisible headline. “How Brexit Took a Bite Out of British Vegetarianism.”",2,1761564523.0,PubTips,0,1.0,False

But teeth can lose their brightness over time because of things like coffee, tea, smoking, or just getting older. Here's the good news: You can bring back your smile's natural glow and feel better about yourself with **professional** [teeth whitening](https://northlanedentalpractice.co.uk/teeth-whitening/).

At **Northlane Dental Practice**, we provide cutting-edge teeth whitening treatments. These are made to give you a brighter smile that lasts longer — in a safe and comfortable way.

# Why Teeth Lose Their Shine

Your daily habits and lifestyle choices can make your teeth look dull or change color. Here are some common reasons:

* Drinking coffee tea red wine, or carbonated beverages
* Smoking
* Getting older and having thinner enamel
* Taking certain medicines or experiencing dental injury

Regular brushing often fails to remove these stains . This is where expert whitening can make a big difference.

# What Is Expert Teeth Whitening?

Expert teeth whitening is a dental procedure that's safe and brightens your teeth by several shades. Unlike store-bought whitening kits expert treatments are customized to your needs and performed under professional supervision, ensuring safety and impressive outcomes.

At Northlane Dental, we design our whitening treatments to give you noticeable results without harming your enamel or causing sensitivity.

# The Whitening Process

1. **Consultation:** We start by checking if your teeth and gums are in good shape to whiten.
2. **Custom Treatment:** Based on what you need, we'll suggest either whitening in our clinic or giving you a kit to use at home with trays made just for you.
3. **Application:** We use a strong whitening gel to get rid of tough stains and make your smile brighter.

You can see a much whiter more glowing smile after just one visit.

# Benefits of Professional Teeth Whitening

✅ **Quick Results:** You'll see whiter teeth right after one session. ✅ **More Self-Assurance:** A lighter smile helps you feel more confident at work and in social settings. ✅ **Harmless and Mild:** Dental experts do the job with top-notch products. ✅ **Personal Approach:** We adjust the process to match your teeth's needs and your desired shade. ✅ **Results That Last:** Keep your bright smile with touch-ups now and then and good teeth care.

# Brighter Smile, Better Mood

A whiter smile doesn't just improve how you look — it can change how you see yourself. Many people we've treated say they smile more , feel more attractive, and walk with more confidence after getting their teeth whitened.

So my wife let me tackle this one myself.

1ohbo9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/mazda/comments/1ohbo9t/some_mazda_features_are_infuriating/,Some Mazda 'features' are infuriating,"I recently purchased a Mazda 3 HB and I love that car to bits, so don't let this rant make you think otherwise. It's fabulous in many ways and, at least for my needs, is far superior to anything else in the same price range and class. But it's not perfect and some of its 'features' are actively annoying. 

I know some of them are due to EU regulations and some are shared by pretty much any other car, but they still drive me up a wall and I wanted to rant about it for a bit:

\- Speed limit alerts. There are some alerts that you can disable in the infotainment system, but there is a permanent speed limit alert that you cannot mute unless you mute all alerts. Issue with that, is that I would like to keep some of them on. It's by far the most infuriating thing about this car, as it's constantly beeping at me, especially in the city (where I do most of my driving)

\- Driver monitoring and a bunch of other settings resetting back to default every time you start the engine. I don't need the car to tell me to stop for a coffee every 2 hours or whatever and I hate that I can't permanently disable that 

\- Hands on wheel alert when using adaptive cruise control with lane keep assist. It requires you to keep hands on wheels at all times and it's very draconian about it: unless I keep my hands in 9-3/10-2 range, it will keep nagging me and eventually turn off cruise control. If I use the adaptive cruise control without the lane keeping portion, I can be much more relaxed and have just 1 hands on the wheel without any problems - so it basically negates what would otherwise be a great feature

\- Speaking of adaptive cruise control, it's way too inconsistent and aggressive. Under normal traffic conditions, when you are just following a car ahead of you, it's great. Nice and smooth, I like it a lot. But as soon as you have clear roads ahead of you, it downshifts and floors the accelerator, revving the engine way past it's normal upshifting threshold. It's very uncomfortable and arguably dangerous, because it does it even when switching lanes on a highway, or sometimes during some corners where it briefly loses sight of the car ahead. In particular in highways, it's extremely uncomfortable when switching lanes: there is a brief period where it doesn't detect any cars and it freacking floors it, but once you are fully in the new lane it will slam the brakes if there are cars in front. I know you can manually press the accelerator during this maneuver, but this would work fine if it wasn't so aggressive on the throttle

\- Front parking sensors have a huge blind spot in the middle. Found out last night when I touched a small post - not a scratch or a dent as the front number plate made contact first and I knew it was there, so I was very cautious about it. But it's the one scenario where a front sensor would actually be useful.. 

\- Wireless charger cooks your phone. I enabled that setting that makes it a bit better, but it's still pretty bad. This one in particular I know it's shared by most cars, but it's pretty embarrassing

\- No remote start here in the EU. This isn't so much an annoying feature, as it's completely missing, but I know it's available in other markets and on other cars even in the EU. So it can be done and it would be nice to have

That's my rant. Partly I wanted to get it off my chest, partly I wanted others to be aware of these issues (despite a very long test drive I didn't run into most of them) and partly I was hoping the community would have some solutions. I'd rather feel like a fool for missing something obvious than living with these issues forever.",0,1761563876.0,mazda,26,0.5,False

I've been browsing this sub a bit in order to learn a bit more about what dating is and I decided to compile a list of things I learned here to check with you all if I understood it all correctly (my autistic ahh could never do anything without preset rules smh) :

\-When asking someone out on a date, keeping the convo short and going in directlyy toward the date invitation is preferable to long winded texting that never gets to the subject of matter  
\-When chosing a first date, a walk or coffee date is preferable to a diner date as it's less formal, allows for more flexibility and if many dates fail will cost less on the long run  
\-If in need of a discussion subject you cna always go watch a movie before the discussion part of the date  
\-Dates can also be organised arround activities to have fun without needing long winded convos  
\-If many dates fail and you start hating on the gender you're attracted to ,datin gculture or couples in general always take a break to avoid incelification  
\-Don't be too clingy or desperate in your approach  
\-Don't be fake (fake detached or lying...) as it can be seen  
\-Don't overread any small thing as a hint  
\-Never shy away from a truthfull conversation without being too brutaly direct in speech as to avoid unnecessary drama  
\-When in a situationship, either get a name for the ship and jump starboard and leave  
\-It may take time while it may also take 2 weeks to find the one, just be ready to build something with someone and be patient

There are multiple reasons for that, but the main one is the sachet culture. Filipinos used to buy things from shampoo to coffee in small sachets good for 1-2 times use. Those sachets are often discarded on the streets or canals, and end up in the ocean shortly.

Those are the facts. But the solution is much harder. A typical solution would be to introduce a sachet tax making it more economical to buy larger quantities. Combined with ban on single-use plastic, strict anti-littering laws enforcement, and proper waste management programs, it would be able to drastically reduce the pollution.

However, Philippines is a democracy, more or less, and politicians rely on masses, mostly poor, to get into their offices. A sachet tax would be viewed as ""anti-poor"", and enforcement is not welcomed. Puerto Princesa banned single-use plastic bags years ago, I am still offered a single use plastic bag without asking for it every single time I buy something in a sari-sari store, even if it's a single can of cola.

Unfortunately, it seems that Filipinos are not aware of their leadership position in the world, and do not see plastic pollution as a problem. And even those who see, would not agree to spend more to eliminate it.",17,1761563248.0,Philippines_Expats,46,0.72,False

Combined with ban on single-use plastic, strict anti-littering laws enforcement, and proper waste management programs, it would be able to drastically reduce the pollution.

However, Philippines is a democracy, more or less, and politicians rely on masses, mostly poor, to get into their offices. A sachet tax would be viewed as ""anti-poor"", and enforcement is not welcomed. Puerto Princesa banned single-use plastic bags years ago, I am still offered a single use plastic bag without asking for it every single time I buy something in a sari-sari store, even if it's a single can of cola.

Unfortunately, it seems that Filipinos are not aware of their leadership position in the world, and do not see plastic pollution as a problem. And even those who see, would not agree to spend more to eliminate it.",1,1761563202.0,Palawan,2,1.0,False
1ohbgsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutlastTrials/comments/1ohbgsf/nobody_would_have_a_problem_with_child_sacrifice/,Nobody would have a problem with child sacrifice in Trials...srsly...,"Today I woke up, after a weekend of pulling 13 hour straight playing the game, and it kinda hit me. Do you guys realize what we're doing here? We're playing a video game around killing, butchering, maiming, crucifying, electrocuting, torturing homeless people with unimaginable ways. This is human sacrifice. 

So I sat behind today wondering, how the hell do we even enjoy this, and what does this say about us? about the human psyche? Maybe, there is a part of us that secretly hates people? left-overs from our ancestral days in the forest and caves? Our subconscious is practicing urges through games, safely.

I remember 15+ years ago, they saw some a/s/s in Mass Effect (video game) and they made it a serious deal in  fox news. Now you're burning some guy's d1ck off (in the game) and it's another day in the office.

I am not writing this to make anyone feel bad, and of course not to drop any shade on games or Red Barrels. I love the game and I enjoy it tremendously. This is just something that came up after contemplation, sitting at 264 hours of play-time.. Everyone can realize that digital violence is different than physical, so is gore. Looking at the insides of someone can triggers fight or flight responses depending on the context and our brain's perception. But in the video games, it's no big deal. 

Honestly, at this point I TRULY BELIEVE that if Trials involved murder of children like actual ritual with screams and all it wouldn't be a bid deal. Do you think people would make fuss about it (video titles something like ""game company took it too far"") or just shrug it off ""New massive update 'Orphanage Catharsis' "", going back to business as usual? Maybe they thought about doing it, but it would get out of scope of the narrative since Murkoff only abducts homeless, not kids because people would initiate search for them going missing?  (Although in the Orphanage, you burn limps in acid, which could be kid because in the screen Easterman is like ""Punish the children"")

What do you guys think?

Can you imagine the shock in some 30-90 year old people (mothers, grandmothers, even fathers) if they ever get to see their kids playing all that? (Auntie comes in the room) ""Hey, what are you playing sweetie?"" ""You know I'm just exploding this guy's head with a remote device from esteemed Dr. Easterman so I can earn tokens to buy cosmetics."" Yes, i know the game is rated Mature 17+ and children are not supposed to play this, but come on... be real. I am close to 30 and I wouldn't let my parents know I am playing this game. Feels like back when I was 6, getting in the strip club in San Andreas...(yep that early someone bought it for my birthday :D). I also remember going in an Internet cafe and playing call of duty while some old woman behind me made a huge deal about ""are we serious, I came here to drink my coffee, Am I going to watch kids killing people?"" So you can understand that for people who have no intimacy with games, it could be a tremendous shock.",0,1761563191.0,OutlastTrials,5,0.33,False

I’ve been working on a side project: an Android app to help keep track of pantry, fridge, freezer, and household items. The idea came from my own experience, I often forget about ingredients or products until they expire

**What the app does so far:**

* Add items manually or by scanning their barcode
* Save name, photo, purchase date, and expiration date
* Organize items by category (food, drinks, etc.) and location (kitchen, freezer…)
* Notifications for items that are about to expire

**What’s planned for the future:**

* Recipe suggestions based on what you have (coming in a future update)

I'm just finishing up the app and looking for beta testers who want to try it and give feedback.

If you’re interested, comment below or send me a message and I’ll give you access to the beta!

[Kosen-rufu Happens One-to-One](https://app.worldtribune.org/kosen-rufu-happens-one-to-one/content.html) or Vice President Tanigawa’s encouragement in [Shine a Light on Every Member](https://app.worldtribune.org/shine-a-light-on-every-member/content.html).

Let me jump to my conclusion. In our MON (Middle of Nowhere) community, we can feel isolated from those gorgeous big culture centers that I never see or even the closest activity center that takes a good 3-4 hour drive with children. But do you know what I realized? There’s a reason that “heart” is in the word “heartland.” The entire SGI-USA organization is slowly but inevitably moving toward the way *we* practice *right here* which naturally matches the three key activity focuses of the SGI-USA: “shakubuku rooted in friendship,” “strengthening our youth,” and “strengthening our district community.” That’s simply the way we do things here.

Guy and I met Eulogio and Dee at the Community College cafeteria where a robust friendship grew into our joint practice in faith and partnership. We met Laverne & Shirley at Costco's. Toni and José met at college and solidified their relationship through working at a family-owned B&B. Emily, John, and Veera were like phoenixes emerging from the cinders of a crashed marriage. And the list goes on and on and on.

Yes, we make great efforts to strengthen our youth here. “Sponsorship” really means something here as witnessed by the great care Guy and I received (and continue to receive) from True and Bob. We try to replicate this model of caring in the way we treat our guests and members.

Vice President Tanigawa points out:

>Both during the time of second Soka Gakkai President Josei Toda and Ikeda Sensei, there were moments when the momentum of shakubuku would suddenly take off. What caused this shift in momentum was when there was a focus on consistent discussion with small groups of people.

Our other specialty: visiting members. We just hop in our cars and have encounters at the homes of our friends, at Starbucks, shopping together at Costco’s and talking while on the long checkout lines, etc. It comes naturally here.

We’ve already invaded the skating rink. Our next frontier? Our small unrenovated old McDonald’s with its playground which the kids see as The Magic Kingdom. What a great place to gather for coffee and a bite while the kids play.

1ohazrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_LiveMates-AE/comments/1ohazrg/how_to_avoid_scams_when_looking_for_a_roommate/,How to avoid scams when looking for a roommate online,"When I first moved to Dubai two years ago, I was so focused on getting my visa sorted and finding a job that I completely underestimated how stressful finding a place to live would be. Rent here is insane, especially if you’re on your own, so like most expats, I decided to look for a roommate. I thought it would be simple — a few Facebook groups, maybe Dubizzle — but honestly, I had no idea how many scams were out there.

My first attempt still makes me cringe. I found a listing on one of those Facebook expat groups — nice photos, affordable rent, good location in Business Bay. The “landlord” said she was currently abroad and couldn’t show the place in person but promised to “reserve the room” if I transferred a one-month deposit. I hesitated, but she sent what looked like a legit Emirates ID and tenancy contract. Something in me still didn’t feel right, but at the time I was so desperate (and tired of sleeping on a friend’s couch) that I almost sent the money. Then I decided to reverse-image search one of the apartment photos… and boom. It was from a property listing on Bayut. The scammer had just stolen pictures from there. That one click probably saved me thousands.

After that, I became overly cautious. I started asking everyone I met about how they’d found roommates. One guy from work told me he lost 4,000 AED to a “roommate” who disappeared after getting the deposit. Another friend said she moved into a flat that looked nothing like the pictures — moldy bathroom, no air conditioning, and an extra person living in the living room who was never mentioned. It’s wild how many people here just rely on blind trust because they’re new, tired, and don’t know the system yet.

Eventually, I developed a kind of mental checklist that I follow religiously whenever I search for a place or a roommate.  
First, I never send any money until I’ve physically seen the apartment and met the person face to face. Video calls don’t count — I’ve had scammers show fake apartments over video too.  
Second, I always ask to see the Ejari or tenancy contract with the landlord’s name. If the person renting can’t provide that or gets defensive, I just walk away.  
Third, I pay attention to how people communicate. Real roommates or landlords usually don’t rush you. Scammers often push with “many people are interested, please confirm today.” If I feel pressured, it’s an instant red flag.

One thing I learned the hard way is that not all “scams” are about money — sometimes it’s about people misrepresenting themselves. I once moved in with a girl who claimed to be quiet and tidy. She turned out to host random friends almost every night, and I’d come home to cigarette smoke and strangers on the couch. It’s not technically a scam, but it still taught me to ask detailed questions about lifestyle, schedules, and habits. You’re not just renting a room; you’re sharing your life with someone.

A few months ago, when I was looking to move again, I decided to try something different. I came across this app called LiveMates — someone on Reddit actually mentioned it in a thread like this. It’s basically for finding roommates in Dubai, and what I liked is that you set preferences — things like smoking, cleanliness, work schedule — and it matches you with people who fit. I didn’t really expect it to work, but that’s actually how I found my current roommate, Anna. She’s from Ukraine, works in marketing, and we just clicked instantly. We even met for coffee before signing anything, and for once, the whole process felt safe and transparent.

Looking back, I think the biggest lesson I’ve learned is that in Dubai, caution is survival. The city attracts people from everywhere — good and bad — and trust has to be earned, not assumed. If something feels off, it probably is. And it’s okay to walk away, even if the place seems perfect or the person seems nice. Losing an apartment is better than losing your savings or peace of mind.

I’m curious how others handle this. Have you been scammed or almost scammed while flat hunting in Dubai? What red flags did you learn to recognize? I feel like everyone here has a story, and if we share them, maybe fewer newcomers will fall into the same traps.",1,1761561543.0,u_LiveMates-AE,0,1.0,False

what changed? at my lowest point in january this year whilst going through a horrendous course of bladder instillations that were somehow causing me MORE pain(??) i discovered the work of Nicole Sachs, and read her book Mind Your Body. it talks about the connection between our minds and bodies and how in SO many cases, chronic pain and condtions are not actually because there's something physically wrong with you (which made sense for me, as all my scans and tests were always clear), its because the solution is not in your body, its to do with your nervous system. after reading her book and listening to many of her podcasts i started doing the mind body work and went from being unable to get off the sofa in pain to pretty much now pain free. yes i still occasionally get bladder pain but because my outlook/mindset on it has shifted, it never lasts or bothers me. my life has completely changed. i can drink alcohol and coffee freely, eat spicy food and im even able to have sex again (although its taking some time, as i didnt have it for so long). i truly thought id never recover but Nicole Sachs work has transformed my life (and my husbands tbh). please, if youre stuggling with IC, be open to this work and it could help you :)

btw i tried anti biotics, bladder instillations, dmannose and alllll the supplements, elmiron, PFT, antihistamines, amitriptyline, TENS, hiprex - you name it, ive tried it. nothing has gotten rid of my symptoms as consistently and as long term as this mind body work.

Once I came across a post, that person said that find out how much a McDonald's Happy Meal is priced in the that country and accordingly price it like that, other one said check the price of a regular coffee and price accordingly.

What I am doing right now is :  
a. Taking the top 15 economies  
b. Finding out their PPP  
c. Setting a price for USA users  
d. Asking ChatGPT to give me a list of pricing according to the PPP in reference to the price I set for USA users.

1. **$1.99 / Weekly** ( Unsubscribe Anytime )  
2. **$9.99 / Life Time**  
3. **$4.99 / Life Time** ( 50% Discount, if they close subscription )

Since the update 2 Weeks ago, I have made **$114** ( I used to make $200 every 3 months with ADs )

I don't normally give coffee a second thought any more even though I was addicted for so long. 

It's not been an amazing change of my life stopping caffeine, but it definitely feels for the better. 

Tiredness and sleep used to be an issue for most of the year. Initially I needed to rely on high levels of hydration, having plenty of potassium, and starting my day with a cold shower. 

It helped for sure, but I don't need most of it any more. Except for the potassium from coconut water. That stuff hits the spot for me to start my day. 

Funnily, drinking 1.5 liters of water in the morning on an empty stomach, it isn't happy about it and I just get the shits. One litre of water is fine though. 

Energy for doing things in the day comes from fruits. I feast on bananas, apples & nectarines and it works really well in keeping me topped up energy wise. I do start my day with 2:1 citrulline malate approximately 10g. That gives a great start. 

At work I will have creatine for the cognitive and physical benefits of working out in the gym. It really does work for me. 

The thing that sucks the most however, is deep fried food at night. If I inadvertently have it, I get hard insomnia, the kind of insomnia that feels worse than having caffeine in your system and not being to stop hearing things around you while you have your eyes closed.

Hey lovely people. I’m a mum to a beautiful girl who is 2 yrs 7 months. 
We are still very much actively breastfeeding and I just simply cannot do it anymore and my mental health is suffering greatly. 
I have loved my breastfeeding journey - it was very important to me to breastfeed for as long as possible and I am so proud that we have made it this far. 

I have tried implementing weaning sporadically (I know weaning relies on routine - it’s hard 😩) and I honestly just kinda naively hoped she would have self weaned by now. However she is OBSESSED and we have milk almost all day everyday. 

I replace with snacks during the day where possible, and I started trying to replace it with milo at nighttime (I know, not a great choice and I am pretty hardcore with not offering that kind of food) but I am desperate and at my wits end. Milo worked for a bit, but she still relies on the milk to go to sleep so it’s kinda pointless. 
I have managed to spend a night away from her here and there and she IS able to go to sleep without me at night (with Dad or with an Aunty - albeit it takes a bit of getting there but she will fall asleep if she has to without me). 
The breastfeeding right now is adding hugely to my depression and resentment to being a mum. I don’t enjoy being a mum at all - I dread everything and I feel so physically and emotionally drained. I know I show all the telltale signs of PPD and I know that me still breastfeeding is 100% the main contributing factor. 

I have discussed stopping breastfeeding with my GP (and that I am desperate), who suggested putting coffee or vinegar on my nipples as a deterrent. This feels too cruel to me, (as desperate as I am) and I have been told that bandaids are another option - but again,I am reluctant because it doesn’t seem like a sensitive way to go about it - but I AM also ready to try anything. 
I have read about the Booby Moon picture story book and I sobbed reading excerpts online. I constantly find myself reading other people’s posts/stories/cries for help to wean and advice, but it just doesn’t seem practical to me for some reason. I follow breastfeeding and cosleeping experts online who have weaning advice/tips/guides and it just makes me spiral because I don’t know where to start and I just want it to be over and thought of having to “begin” weaning and all that comes with it makes me want to spew. 

I am at the point now where I feel I either spend more than one night away (two night trip away or longer) - but I still feel that as soon as I’m back she will just use the milk again to go to sleep and it won’t “work”, I try the bandaid method and explain that mummy’s boobs are “sore” etc… 
Breastfeeding is beautiful and I have loved it and wouldn’t have had it any other way. I am so grateful for my journey and I feel so guilty for wanting to stop and taking this away from her, but I want to be able to move on now together and live my best life and feel whole and like “me” again. 

I’m sorry for my rant and I hope I don’t sound like a crazy negative person. xx ",1,1761560813.0,breastfeeding,4,0.67,False
