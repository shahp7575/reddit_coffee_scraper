1mb6xow,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mb6xow/ex_cheated_we_stayed_friends_i_accidentally/,"Ex cheated, we stayed friends. I accidentally hooked up with her best friend while blackout drunk. Now everything’s a mess.","I (27F) and my ex, Ruby (26F), are still good friends. We were together for almost five years, and she cheated on me during a five-month period of long-distance at the end of last year. The breakup was messy because we were genuinely in a happy, healthy relationship. We truly loved each other. We called every night while we were apart, and all our friends said we were that couple—the one people looked up to as an example of a great partnership.

In December, she met a woman (32F) through work—someone she told me about. Let’s call her Luna. I wasn’t the jealous type because I trusted her, especially since this woman was married to a man.

I came back to my country in mid-January and reunited with Ruby, but something felt off. She tried to act normal, but I could tell something was wrong. Out of nowhere, she asked for a “break,” saying she needed to readjust her life and routine now that I was back. It was strange, because before the long-distance period, we were inseparable. We saw each other almost every day, practically lived together, and brought each other everywhere. We were a unit.

I was so confused. It completely caught me off guard. I’m the kind of person who doesn’t believe in “breaks”—to me, it means the relationship is over. But being my hopeful, naive self, I said yes, thinking maybe we could still fix it.

By February, we already had plans to travel overseas for a concert. We booked everything in December, so canceling wasn’t an option. We went on the trip with Luna and her friend (29F). I already had suspicions, but I brushed them off—again, because Luna was married.

Long story short, I caught them cheating. We were drunk, and I saw their texts. To put it lightly, I exploded—but only at Ruby, not Luna. We officially broke up that night. It was a three-day trip, and that happened on day one.

Honestly, I’m proud of how I handled things afterward. The next morning, the three of us sat down and talked calmly. They apologized and explained, and I listened. I told them how I felt, wished them good luck, and even asked Luna to take care of Ruby—because I really loved her.

We still had two days left on the trip. And I was nice. I tried to seem as “okay” as possible. I genuinely befriended Luna—we talked, we laughed, we joked. Ruby looked even more stressed, probably because of how I was reacting. When I got back, my friends said I was insane for staying, let alone being civil.

Not gonna lie—it was hard. My heart felt so heavy. But I’m a firm believer that what’s meant for me will be mine. I gave her my best, and if that wasn’t enough, then maybe I’m not the one.

I felt completely lost. I thought I’d spend the rest of my life with Ruby. She wasn’t just my girlfriend—she was my best friend. I thought once I came back, everything would go back to normal. I was so excited to return, because those five months apart were brutal. I was alone in another country, missing milestones my ex and friends were experiencing without me. I missed home. But the “home” I pictured in my head had already started building itself somewhere else.

After that, I was a wreck. I drank almost every night, cried every day. I still stayed in touch with Ruby. We talked occasionally. I’m not going to pretend I don’t love or care about her anymore, but now it’s just in a different form.

Then came Damien (26M)—Ruby’s ex, best friend, and business partner. I was friends with him too, since they worked together and I often tagged along. They were very close: shared secrets, ran a brand together, had the same hobbies. I was never threatened by him—they only dated for about four months, two years before I came into the picture. He was always the third wheel in our relationship. I was friendly but not too close, partly because Ruby once told me he’d said I was pretty, and it made her jealous. She even told him not to “try anything funny” with me from the start. Ruby always had a sense that Damien liked me. So we both kept our distance. We were close in a group sense, not personally.

The breakup affected him too. Ruby distanced herself from almost everyone—most of our friends sided with me, including him. To be clear, I never asked anyone to choose sides. But people naturally comforted me more. Ruby and Damien’s work relationship suffered—projects were delayed, and she became more sensitive and defensive around him, making communication difficult. As a result, Damien and I got closer. We started hanging out almost every day—texting, drinking, venting. It was purely platonic. We were both grieving in our own way: I lost my girlfriend, and he lost his best friend.

He comforted me a lot. He’s the kind of guy who gives compliments freely. I was struggling with body image after gaining a lot of weight over the past two years. The stress of being abroad and the breakup brought me back to my old weight. He noticed, and often told me I looked more confident and pretty, that he was proud of me. Those words helped. I started taking better care of myself, and I got so many compliments from people—even strangers replying to my Instagram stories.

Two months into our new friendship dynamic, we were drinking at his place, just talking like usual. Then, out of nowhere, the sadness hit me again. I cried about the question that haunted me: “Why did she do that to me?” He said he didn’t understand either, and told me that if he were her, he would never have let someone like me go. He said spending more time with me made him realize how little he actually knew me before. He admitted that over those two months, he started to like me more than he expected. I didn’t know what to say. I knew that if Ruby ever found out, she’d be furious. I told him I didn’t feel the same way, but I understood.

After that, he started mentioning it more—buying me food, complimenting me more, making time to see me. I acknowledged it but never encouraged it. I never breadcrumbed him. For me, he was still just a platonic friend.

One night, after hanging out with friends, he drove me home. He was venting about how his friendship with Ruby was falling apart. We parked and kept talking. He cried and asked for a hug. I hugged him. But during the hug, he tried to put his hand inside my shirt and kissed me. I pushed him away and said no. He apologized and said it wouldn’t happen again, so we kept talking until he calmed down. Nothing else happened that night. But after that, he occasionally joked about sex or dating me.

Fast forward to July—I was in a better place. I wasn’t sad anymore. I only drank occasionally. I had a stable job. Ruby and Damien were slowly mending their friendship. The three of us even hung out a few times and things felt normal again.

Until last week.

We were working on a project at a bar, and we drank a lot. I blacked out almost completely. Ruby went home with Luna, and I went home with Damien—but we had a driver. Everything I know about that night comes from other people.

Before we left the bar, people told me that I was still talking, standing, helping load things—normal drunk behavior. In the car, Damien said I puked, so he gave me a plastic bag. At my apartment, I still found my own keys, drank water, and gathered my stuff like normal. He said I puked again in the bathroom, and when he tried to help me to bed, I refused and asked for clean clothes. He gave me some and went to the bathroom. When he came out, I was still sitting, saying I couldn’t change. He helped me again, but we both fell onto the daybed. I landed on top of him. He said I didn’t want to move and told him to stay. Then, according to him, I asked him to sleep with me.

He said he was shocked and asked me several times if I was sure, and I kept saying yes. He said we talked and joked during it. I apparently laughed and said something like, “If we were girls, this usually would last till morning.” because I never been with a man before. I don’t remember any of this.

The next morning, I woke up naked in my bed—horrified. Damien was asleep on the daybed. I had a split-second flashback and panicked. I called Ruby and told her I thought something had happened. She immediately asked, “Was it Damien?” I said yes and told her I’d explain later.

On the way to work, Damien texted me like nothing had happened, asking how to lock up.

At work, I told Ruby everything. She was furious. She had told Damien to take care of me. She went to his house, yelled at him, punched his table, even threw her cap in frustration. Then she called me back to share what she said to him—but also told me she was disappointed in me for not taking care of myself.

Damien later texted me to apologize. He said he didn’t realize I was blacked out—that I seemed responsive, was speaking normally, and he genuinely thought it was consensual. He asked if he could explain in person, but I didn’t respond.

That day and the next, I had several panic attacks. Severe ones.

Eventually, I agreed to meet him at a coffee shop because I needed to just get this over with. He told me the whole timeline. I told him I felt sad and taken advantage of, even if it wasn’t intentional. But I also acknowledged that I shouldn’t have let myself get that drunk. He took full responsibility and apologized again. The panic attacks eased after that.

The next day, I met up with Ruby and her friend Lily (26F), who’s also my friend—but I originally met her through Ruby. Turns out Ruby had already told Lily what happened, so we talked about it. I told Lily my side of the story, and I noticed Ruby looking visibly upset. After I finished, she said she didn’t understand why it upset her so much—when this should be my and Damien’s problem. I couldn’t help but think she felt a little jealous but couldn’t admit it—because she’s already with Luna now.

A few days later, Damien asked me to accompany him while he waited for a project launch because he said he was so nervous about this project. Ruby still wasn’t speaking to him. I went. We talked like usual and avoided the topic. I tried to mentally file that night away as just a hookup, but it’s still kinda hard. I’ve never had a hookup before, let alone with a man. And all I remember is a flash.

Now I’m scared this will be the final nail in the coffin for their friendship and their brand. I don’t want that. I watched them build it from the ground up. I helped build it. And now, this situation—it just breaks my heart.

I don’t know what to do. Please give me your opinion.

TL;DR:
My ex (F26) cheated on me during long-distance with a married woman (F32). We broke up but stayed close friends. Her best friend and business partner (M26) and I became close during the aftermath. While blackout drunk, I apparently initiated sex with him, which I don’t remember. It’s caused chaos between all of us, and now I’m terrified this will destroy their friendship and brand. I don’t know how to fix it.",0,1753677238.0,relationships,0,0.25,False

I hear about all the time so I decided to give it a try to improve my health and see how it goes.I used to drink maybe 2 cups a day, 3 max

The thing is.. I can't drink plain water. I just can't. I tried, didn't work. So I decided to drink more tea. It's just water but with a flavor

After a week or so I started having trouble sleeping. I would just lie in my bed, staring at the ceiling until 5 am and then finally have a couple of hours of sleep. Sometimes I couldn't even do that. Sometimes I could feel my chest was hurting and my heart becoming crazy. I blamed it on sleep deprivation.I had no idea what the problem was. I don't drink coffee at all since 2019 because of medical issues, I never drink cola or any soda. My tea doesn't have any sugar in it. Wtf is going on 

Today, after another night without a sleep I decided to at least google what could be going on with me. Turns out 4-5 mugs (1+ liter)of tea a day is really bad for you. So yeap, tea is the problem. My insomnia began around that time when I began drinking too much tea 

My tea addiction is real and it's hurting me for real. Tea contains caffein, which is bad for me. Especially if I drink strong tea (which I like). And especially if you drink ot 3-5 hours before bed (which I do)

I know now I should cut on  tea, but I still don't know what to drink instead

1mb6wmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/soapmaking/comments/1mb6wmp/understanding_the_basics_of_handmade_soapmaking/,Understanding the Basics of Handmade Soapmaking,"We thought we should offer some advice to the community for when you are ready to start making your own soaps. Our advice is a summary from asking over 780 users of our app.

Handmade soapmaking can be a fun and rewarding hobby that lets you create custom products just for you! In this guide, we’ll explore different types of soap, such as cold process and melt-and-pour. We’ll also discuss ingredients, safety tips, and simple recipes to help you get started. Whether you’re a complete beginner or hoping to enhance your skills, this article will provide the information you need to begin your soapmaking journey!

Understanding the chemistry of soap making, particularly the function of sodium hydroxide, is important for beginners. This lye is mixed with distilled water in a heat-safe vessel, initiating the saponification process. A soap calculator helps ensure accurate measurements and batch sizes, preventing issues during the soap-making process. The choice of oils, such as palm oil or olive oil, influences the soap’s lather, hardness, and moisturizing properties.

For instance, a 3-oil soap base recipe can lead to a creamy texture, while herbal soap using lovely greens may appeal to natural soap-making enthusiasts. Safety measures include wearing gloves and goggles, working in a ventilated area, and keeping children and pets away from the kitchen sink. Tools like an immersion blender and thermometer assist in achieving the perfect light trace for the soap batter. Molds, such as a wooden loaf mold or baking pan lined with parchment paper, simplify cutting into bars once the soap sets.

Proper storage can help maintain the shelf life of the homemade soap, while experimenting with additives and fragrance oils can enhance the final product’s appeal.

Essential Supplies for Handmade Soapmaking

Lye
Lye, or sodium hydroxide, is an important ingredient in making soap, as it initiates the saponification process, turning fats and oils into soap. During this process, sodium hydroxide reacts with the oils, creating soap batter that eventually cures and becomes solid. Safety is important; when handling lye, it is necessary to wear protective gear and work in a well-ventilated area to avoid fumes.

Lye should always be mixed with distilled water in a heat-safe vessel, and it is important to follow a soap calculator to achieve accurate measurements. There are mainly two types of lye used: potassium hydroxide for liquid soaps and sodium hydroxide for solid soap bars. Beginners can start with easy soap recipes that provide guidance on small batches, such as cold process soap using simple recipes with a base of palm oil and other natural ingredients.

Cutting into bars should be done after the proper curing time, and eco-friendly soap can be enhanced with additives, like herbs and floral oils, for extra benefits. A scale, measuring cup, and thermometer ensure success in each step of the soapmaking journey.

Oils and Butters
Different types of oils and butters offer a variety of benefits to handmade soapmaking. Incorporating oils like olive, coconut, and palm oil in a 3-oil soap recipe creates a balanced lather and moisture. Each oil affects the final texture, varying in absorbency and skin feel. Coconut oil adds a bubbly lather, while olive oil enhances moisturizing properties. For certain skin types, such as dry or sensitive skin, adding emollient-rich butters like shea or cocoa can improve hydration.

When formulating cold process soap, it’s important to consider the desired properties as well as the shelf life of ingredients, using a soap calculator to ensure proper oil ratios. For herbal soap, incorporating natural ingredients like lovely greens can boost benefits. During the saponification process, accurate measuring with a scale and adjusting the water discount is important for achieving the right consistency.

Maintaining appropriate temperature while mixing sodium hydroxide in a heat-safe vessel ensures safety and efficiency in soap making. Proper ventilation during this process helps to reduce fumes. Those creating eco-friendly soap should consider using distilled water and can easily pour the soap batter into a wooden loaf mold or baking pan lined with waxed paper for easy removal later.

Additives
In handmade soapmaking, various additives enhance the properties and benefits of the final product. Exfoliants like ground coffee or oatmeal, along with botanical ingredients such as dried herbs and floral oils, enrich soap recipes. The choice of additives impacts the texture and appearance of the soap; for instance, lovely greens can add natural color and depth, while exfoliants provide a gentle scrub in the finished bars.

Precautions need to be taken when incorporating certain additives to ensure safety and effectiveness.

For example, when using sodium hydroxide in the cold process, one must carefully measure the quantities and use a soap calculator to avoid issues. It’s also important to use distilled water in a heat-safe vessel and maintain proper temperature when mixing the soap batter. Beginners may benefit from simple recipes that include larger batches and focus on a base recipe, ensuring the use of recommended molds, like a wooden loaf mold or baking pan, and protective gear in a well-ventilated area. Once the saponification process is complete, the homemade soap should be cut into bars, wrapped in waxed paper, and stored properly to maximize shelf life.

Fragrance and Colorants
When choosing fragrances for handmade soap, it’s important to keep skin sensitivities and scent longevity in mind. Beginners may prefer essential oils since they typically have softer scents and can enhance floral soap aromas. Fragrance oils offer a variety of scents but might cause sensitivities for some. A soap calculator can help determine the appropriate amount to avoid skin issues.

Various colorants, like natural clays or mica, significantly influence soap’s appearance and the texture of the batter during the saponification phase. Safety precautions are essential; working in a well-ventilated area and wearing protective gear is always advised when mixing colorants. Starting with small batches in a heat-safe vessel allows you to observe their effects without risking larger amounts.

Mixing fragrances and colorants can elevate the soap-making experience. For beautiful greens, combining a floral scent with a natural green colorant can produce an attractive look. Following straightforward recipes and maintaining a light trace when adding colorants aids in achieving even distribution in cold process soap, ensuring it is visually appealing and enjoyable to use.

It has officially been two weeks since I was admitted and a little over a week since my surgery.

I could explain all the reasons I miss smoking and why I felt like it was beneficial to me specifically but.. thats the addiction speaking. So here's what I'm struggling with- wtf do I do? I am healing from my surgery so I can't do busy work comfortably, can't masturbate and due to my posture I can't really draw. I feel like I can't play my favorite games because I get too excited and without my cigarette break, I'm left with a bunch of adrenaline and anxiety.

I'm a house husband so I feel like I'm going crazy here and the cravings aren't horrible but definitely getting worse. I have the patch so what I feel like I'm missing is the ritual. Wasting five minutes to an hour outside, the motions of smoking but not necessarily the cigarette itself. Drinking a butt load of coffee because its my happy drink and having a coffee on the porch is the best alternative I have in my current state.

This is mostly just a rant, I have to say something. I guess I'd be interested to hear how yall killed time while quitting?

Then I don't necessarily want to quit nicotine, it does help with my anxiety but would staying on the patch just mean perpetual cravings? Anyone who quit smoking but stayed on the patch/gum?",1,1753676994.0,stopsmoking,0,1.0,False

The morning passed in a haze, being a Saturday, I wasn’t expected to be anywhere, and I decided I was going to enjoy it to the fullest. The tile floor of the kitchen was cool on the soles of my feet as I shuffled over to the fridge. The heat of the summer sun was only just starting to warm the house, but it wasn’t quite to the point that it would overwhelm the air conditioner; however, it would be a different story by noon. As I rummaged around the fridge trying to figure out what I wanted to eat I heard footsteps approaching from behind.

“Morning” My father’s voice was raspy from sleep as he walked to the coffee maker to start a pot.

“Morning” I said while extracting the upper half of my body from the depths of my cave dive to the back of the fridge. I closed the fridge as I turned to face him seeing him put a new filter in the coffee maker.

“How’d you sleep?”  He asked the same every morning whenever we caught each other in the kitchen, our almost morning ritual while we both mentally prepared for the day.

“Pretty good. You?”

“Yeah, I woke up about two o’clock last night to the coyotes.” He scratched the growing stubble on his cheek before rubbing a hand down his face. At almost sixty now, I was starting to see the years in him, he still looked as strong as he did when I was a kid, just more tired nowadays.

“I didn’t hear ‘em.”

“Yeah, they were howling there for about an hour before they finally stopped, sounded about like ten or twelve of ‘em.”

“Yeah, I slept like a rock last night so I didn’t hear ‘em.” We were making the same comfortable idle conversation we always seemed to fall into whenever we first started our conversations.

“What time did you get to sleep last night?”

“Bout nine or ten or so.”

“Hmm, that’s kinda unusual for you, you’re usually a night owl.” He wasn’t wrong, sleeping early was unusual for me but it was just part of life, as long as it didn’t get in the way of anything that needed to be done it was just accepted at face value and we all moved on.

“Yeah, I guess I was just feeling kinda tired yesterday” I said it in a dismissive way because truthfully there was no real reason why, and I didn’t want to talk about it too much.

“Uh Oh, you’re not feeling sick with something are you?” His tone of voice didn’t change much, and neither did his body language but I could tell he really cared. Just one of the perks of knowing someone for so long.

“Naw, I was just a little tired”

“Well, I’m glad you’re not coming down with something” His words rang genuine as leaned against the counter that the coffee maker sat on. It began to hum its morning tune, signaling its work before the telltale trickle of coffee turned into a small flow.

“Me too. Did you hear about that accident at the plant the other day?” I recalled the incident that I had only recently heard about, even though I had worked there about six months prior, quitting wasn’t an easy thing as I had grown to greatly respect most of the guys I worked with and had begun to genuinely like them but when I thought about having to do that kind of work for the rest of my life it made my decision a little easier, well that and the maybe permanent nerve damage in the ends of my thumbs. Like they say, just grit your teeth and get through it.

“Yeah, I heard about that, some of those guys had to go to the hospital but I don’t think anyone got too bad hurt.” My dad still worked at the plant, but how long he’d be there was anyone’s guess as his particular kind of work had him travelling a lot, chasing the money, from one job site to the next.

“That’s good, its already rough enough in that kind of place, it’s a miracle no one got killed.”

“Yeah, you’re right about that.” We both knew how dangerous a chemical plant could be. There existed any number of hazards that one could only account for after they had been in that kind of environment for an extended period, and while leaks were few and far between, they were not unheard of. A moment of negligence is all it takes to cost you your life.

We lapsed into a comfortable silence for a bit while we both waited for the coffee to finish brewing, the smell of fresh coffee wafted through the house as the morning sun finally decided to shine its rays over the old oak trees and into our home casting the kitchen and attached dining room in a warm golden glow. Although we called it a dining room it was more like a partitioned off part of the kitchen with a table and some chairs, with no real separation from the kitchen aside from a square archway that extended about a foot out from the walls and ceiling, leaving an opening to pass through about twelve feet wide. While our home wasn’t very large, it was a decent size and a little oddly shaped on the in side but it stood through hurricane after hurricane, and flood after flood, while the centuries old oaks around us fell, so I had no doubt in my mind, while my father built it around when I was born, it would be here long after my children joined me in glory.

“How’s school going?” While my father openly supported me in my decision to pursue college, I knew his opinion on the matter well. While he would never speak ill of someone, he would make it known when he thought there was a better way and when he thought someone was making a mistake, and for the most part I was inclined to agree with him. Most of the time, that is.

“It’s going good, the semester just ended, and I finished the classes I had with a mix of high and low Bs. An eighty-one, eighty-seven, and an eighty-five.”

“Good deal, do you know when your next classes start?”

“Registration starts again in a couple of weeks if I’m not mistaken”

“Do you know what you’ll be doing?”

“I’ll have to check with my advisor to get the specifics and pick which ones I can take right now but there a handful of classes I need that are starting this semester.”

“You better make sure before it’s too late.” He said it in the same way he always did, just an advising caution. The same way that you tell someone to drive safely.

“I will” I did my best not to sound dismissive, but I didn’t enjoy speaking on this subject, especially when those around me believed I wouldn’t receive any fruits for my labor.

He turned and poured himself a cup of coffee before settling the pot back in its place. He sipped his coffee for a moment before leaning forward and starting to walk away, probably to sit under the awning he built on the back porch while he drank his coffee.

“Love you, dad” I said it after him and as much to his back as I did to him. He turned halfway, just enough to look at me before responding.

“Love you too, boy” He gave me a smile that told me he meant every word. While I doubted that he believed in the path I had chosen to follow in life, I never doubted that he loved me. My father had lived a life of hard work and labor, doing his best and eventually improving his lot in life. I respected him with my whole heart, and truthfully, I understood why he saw things the way he did. He had tried college when he was young but decided to just get to work instead, and since then he’d been working blue collar for the better part of forty-three years until he’d worked his way up to an inspector. Growing up I hadn’t thought much about what I would do for the rest of my life so when it came time to ante up, I took his suggestion and didn’t think about what else I could do. Thinking I wouldn’t be able to get a college degree, I had chosen to follow a similar path to his. After working in the industry for a little more than 6 months, I ran into several people that had a choice to do the work as well as those who didn’t. It was when I ended up on the night shift and worked with one man in particular that started my shift in perspective, nowadays I can’t remember what his name is, but I do remember what he said to me.

He told me, “If you’re working out here or anywhere you’ve got to really want it beyond just what it pays. Is your life really worth the numbers on that paystub? If you lose something out here, an arm, a leg, years of your life, is it going to be worth it? In five, ten, twenty years sure you’ll be making pretty good money but when you get there that’s all you’ll ever make, whereas if you go get an education, you’ll start closer to that number and you’ll go higher in half as much time. So, like I said if you’re going to do this there’s got to be some other reason that you’re out here, you’ve got to really want it.”

Like most things, more than anyone would believe, I remember that night clearly. That man was one of the dozen or so people that changed how I looked at things, of course once I had begun to doubt the course I was on it was only a matter of time and getting caught up in my own head again. When I had thought about where I would be in ten more years, I decided that I couldn’t do it, I wasn’t able to give my life to the craft. So, I did what I was taught to do, look for a better way and move on.

Unfortunately, what looks like a better way to one person may look like folly to another, and as such my father and I didn’t quite see eye to eye on some things but I can hardly blame him, the world he grew up in was vastly different than the one he raised me in and the world we live in now is different than even the one that I grew up in. Eventually I found a path I believed I could follow for the rest of my life and began to walk it, now I just have to see where it ends.

I poured a mug of coffee for myself, adding a little cream and sugar to it before pausing for a moment and deciding to pull out another mug for my mother when she woke up. After I set the mug next to the coffee maker I decided to head back to my room and relax some since the classes I would have been lightly stressing over ended. I headed up the stairs to the second floor and did my best to hold my slightly over full coffee steady as to not spill any on the white carpet my father had put on the stairs, and made it to my room, I closed the door and sat down on the small couch that had been given to me and began drinking my coffee. After a few minutes the silence started to get to me and I turned on my computer, content to read while I finished my coffee, unfortunately I underestimated how much time could pass while I was absorbed in a book and by the time I looked up several hours had passed and my empty mug sat forgotten next to me.

“How long was I reading?” I murmured under my breath while I looked out my window to the early afternoon light.

“I’m sure it was just eight a few minutes ago” I looked down at the internal clock on my computer which now read two-thirty in the afternoon. My eyebrows shot up and I was filled with no small amount of surprise to learn that I had been reading for six hours.

“Yep, time for a break.” I switched off my computer and stood up stretching as I did so and felt much better after multiple vertebrae in my upper back popped. I groaned in relief at the sensation of the pressure being released and headed for my door, pausing just long enough to snag my phone from where it sat on my bed. I walked to the side door, passing through the kitchen on my way out where I saw my mother pouring some tea for herself.

“Hey, mom”

“Hey, where are you going?”

“I’m just going out for a walk”

“Alright, be safe, watch for snakes”

“I will” living in the more rural part of the southern United States, telling someone to watch for snakes on a walk was probably one of the most commonly said phrases behind ‘drive safe’ and ‘be careful’ but it wasn’t for no reason, snake venom wasn’t a pleasant thing being everything from minorly paralytic to necrotic and everything in between and the snakes themselves being camouflaged well enough that you need a particularly sharp eye to spot one that isn’t out in the open. Unfortunately, I was one of those people that could smell them which as told by my father was unusual but not uncommon, the reason I say unfortunately is because snakes do not smell pleasant, like a mixture of something spoiled and pond water.

As I walked, I breathed in the fresh air and listened to the sounds of the wind rustling the trees. The sunlight wouldn’t have been unbearable but when combined with ninety-eight percent humidity it doesn’t take long to warm up. Our home sat on a few acres of land that was surrounded by trees with a few scattered oaks and ever-greens growing out in the open. The land was hilly for being ten acres but that was to be expected since much of it used to be swamp before the dirt was hauled in to make it steady for a home but on one side a section of the water from the small marsh that used to be here was blocked in to make a small pond. It was big enough to fish comfortably without crossing lines with a buddy but small enough that if you put too much power into the cast, you would clear the water all together. We lived somewhere in the middle between lost, peace, and paradise, but in recent years more people had begun moving here in search of paradise not knowing that they’d come up just short and that if they had looked a little harder, they would have found it, preferably away from here. I don’t necessarily dislike people but the more of them that are in one place the higher your chances of your day being disturbed for whatever reason caught their fancy.

I walked for a few minutes out to our mailbox and back, the round trip totaling a quarter mile, enough to stretch my legs and start sweating in the ninety-five-degree heat, but not enough to really exhaust me. As I stepped back into our house the cool air hit me as soon as I cleared the threshold feeling like ice after the short time I spent in the warm summer air. I stopped by the fridge on my way through the kitchen and grabbed a bottle of water before heading upstairs back to my room. When I got to the top of the stairs the temperature had increased by about ten degrees when compared to the first floor and sat at around eighty. Warm enough to be uncomfortable under a blanket but otherwise the perfect temperature to take a nap in, I put on some fresh clothes before laying down in my bed and pulling out my phone. I scrolled for a few minutes before deciding I wanted to read something and, sorting through my library of backlogged books, found one I decided sounded interesting enough. I hardly made it through the first three chapters before I found myself dozing off, I startled awake and decided to put my phone down and just lay back, sleep found me only a moment after I had surrendered to it.

When I opened my eyes, I was standing in a forest, the trees around me resembled the tall pines that grew in patches around my home except these were much more plentiful. Everywhere I looked the pines stretched for as far as I could see in all directions, every tree looked to be fully grown already being two to four feet in diameter and the canopy looming far enough above that to see the top of the tree I stood under I had to lean back slightly.

A light breeze cooled my skin and carried the scent of pine sap, permeating my clothing and filling my nose. The climate of this forest was much more pleasant than I was used to, being cool but not chilly, enough to justify a sleeve if you weren’t going to be doing anything physically demanding but more than warm enough to simply ignore the temperature if you wanted to wear lighter clothing.

My ears were filled with the sound of rustling leaves and creaking wood as the wind near the canopy seemed to be quite a bit stronger than the breeze I was experiencing on the ground, the sky was overcast and tinged with gray as the breeze cooled ever so slightly more. I breathed deeply through my nose and did my best to pick out the smells on the breeze and subtly, under the aroma of pine resin, I smelled the scent of a storm coming.

I looked around for any sign of where I was and where I should go but couldn’t see anything except the ancient pines that sprawled across the land. I looked to the sky trying to see where the sun was and how much light I might have, but when I looked up my vision was greeted only by ever darkening storm clouds shading the land with the promise of rain and nature’s wrath. It wouldn’t be good to stay out in the rain and potential lightning, I’d just have to pick a direction and start walking and hope I found….

*What was I looking for?*

*Why am I out here?*

*Where am I?*

The questions spun through my mind one after another several times before my confusion was interrupted by a deep rumbling that started in my feet before traveling up my body and finally into my ears and I recognized the thunder in the distance.

*I must move soon or be caught out in the rain.*

I felt a tugging sensation in my chest, pulling me towards a random direction off to my left. I had no greater options nor lesser evils to choose from so I turned and started walking, as I walked the air which had once been a comfortable temperature took on a chill to it that seemed to bite deep into my bones and spread through my blood, it felt like my blood was being filled with shards of ice as my skin started to prickle.

*I need to find shelter.*

I walked for several minutes, thunder rumbling in the distance every so often as if to make sure I hadn’t forgotten about it. The storm was still a few miles off by my count and moving slow if the thunder was any indicator, but I would be caught in my death if I let it catch up.

*How do I know that?*

I faltered for a step as the thought hit me like a freight train but kept walking, the tugging sensation in my chest had started pulling to the side ever so slightly causing my course to arc to the right gently and had started feeling more like someone had tied a rope to my ribs and was pulling me forward. I walked forward; my arms wrapped around myself to preserve what little warmth was left in me as I marched on to my unknown destination. Soon I heard a light ringing but it was unsteady, rising and falling in volume but echoing between the trees, nonetheless. I walked onward and eventually the ringing changed into what I recognized as the clanging of two pieces of metal being bashed together, and eventually an orange glow pierced the trees ahead of me.

*A camp? Perhaps they’ll shelter me for the night through the storm.*

I walked on, a small measure of vigor restored to me as I approached the warming fire that cast its glow on those around it. Soon I reached a clearing that I hadn’t realized was before me, as soon as I crossed the threshold of the trees into the clearing, I felt eyes on the back of my neck. I quickly glanced around for who was watching me, but I saw no one, only the same silent pines from whence I approached, I turned back acknowledging the feeling of being watched but set it aside for now to inspect the camp before me.

The camp was about one hundred yards wide and long with wagons and tents spread out across the space wherever there was room, to my left it seemed a makeshift blacksmith had been set up for simple repairs, a small anvil, tongs, hammer, a sack of coal, and a few loose bricks cobbled into a place for heating metal.

*Resourceful.*

The thought came unbidden and sounded flat in my own head, to my right canvas tents were lined up in rows five long and two wide, each one with its own fire and cooking pot outside and about a fifteen-foot-wide path between each row.

*About one hundred twenty tents, if it’s two to a tent possible two hundred forty obvious combatants.*

*Combatants?*

I was both confused and nervous, at the thought of fighting two hundred and forty people, and even more confused that I had immediately registered them as hostile. I shook my head slightly and walked a little further into the camp, the thought of warming up by the fire pulling me ever so slowly closer. As I got closer, I noticed some space on the far side of the camp that seemed set aside for something, I looked closer and immediately noticed horses and wagons on the left side, but these were fundamentally different than the ones I had seen when approaching. When I approached, the wagons I had seen looked like they were meant to carry a lot of equipment a very long distance, but these look more suited for transporting people, albeit uncomfortably but willingly.

I made note of a horse that was tied a short distance away from the others.

*Close, but still isolated.*

As I looked right, I noticed right away a large opulent tent made of some unknown material that had been dyed a mix of reds, purples, and blues. There was a gap between it and the canvas tents of about thirty feet with five black and purple tents in the center of that space forming a short divider between them.

*Must be the commander and his guards.*

I continued walking forward and crossed the final short distance to the campfire, as soon as I was within reach of its warmth, I could feel it spreading through me, wrapping around my frozen bones and thawing them out, melting the shards of ice in my blood. The warmth of the fire wrapped around me like an embrace, and I sagged a little with relief, as I regained feeling in my fingers and toes, someone nearby finally noticed my presence and was visibly shaken by it.

I turned my eyes to regard him but made no other movement than that, the man in question who appeared to be a soldier or mercenary of some kind must have been possessed of a mental sickness or heavily inebriated, as when I turned my gaze upon him, he turned and fled like wolves nipped at his heels.

*It seems I shall find no shelter here.*

I turned my gaze to the sky above and saw the storm clouds had turned a shade of midnight black that implied that the coming storm would seek to wash away our presence, yet a drop of rain had yet to fall. The clanking of metal on metal, and the thump of approaching boots were the only warning I had before I was surrounded by this small army, if an army it could be called. I turned my eyes from the heavens above back to the world around me and raked my gaze over the gathered men as the fire still warmed me. They each reacted differently to my attention, some would flinch, others would grip their swords tighter in preparation for a fight, others still seemed confused why they had gathered the entirety of the camp for one man. I was inclined to agree with those that were confused.

Soon the soldiers near the back of the group began parting as others approached, as they grew closer, I began discerning more details about them. Three knights wearing black and purple armor and two women dressed in fine clothes, gold, and jewels. The women led the group and the foremost of the two wore a crown that seemed a mix of gold, silver, diamonds, and rubies the crown had a rolled white fur edge where it made contact with her brown hair, the crown had nine arrowhead shaped points on it with the nineth being front and center above her forehead with by far the largest diamond I’ve ever seen embedded in the center being an oval shape that was two and a half inches tall and an inch wide and masterfully cut with the finest attention to detail.

I let my gaze drift down to her face, she had deep chocolate brown hair that fell down in ringlets and framed her heart shaped face, her warm brown eyes studied me much the same as I did her.

*She is familiar, somehow.*

The thought sat in the back of my head and sifted through my memories while I continued to examine the woman before me. She held herself with confidence, much the same as someone who trusted in the capabilities of themselves and those around them. She had the pale, soft looking skin of someone who didn’t spend much time in the sun, her figure was healthy like someone who ate well but had the discipline not to be gluttonous. She had soft eyes and high cheek bones; her jaw was on the sharp side but not overly so and led into full pink lips.

*Why is she so familiar?*

The thought began to gnaw at the back of my mind. I looked at her closer now, she was just slightly taller than me, so I didn’t notice at first, but after my eyes passed over it a few times I saw it.

“Bow the ruler of the realm, queen of Enelstra.” One of the black knights which I now realized were the royal guard spoke in a deep baritone voice. I flicked my eyes over to him for a moment and back just as quickly.

*There! On her cheek bone.*

“You dare disregard a direct order from the royal guard boy?” Another of the guards spoke this time with no small measure of indignation in his voice, he sounded younger than the one that had spoken before. I didn’t even spare him a glance as I squinted my eyes slightly and tilted my head a little to better see the queen’s cheek. Seeming to read my mind she turned her head down just enough to see it properly while the corners of her lips quirked up in the smallest of smiles.

*There! A scar!*

Recognition flooded through me as the memory of my last dream was dragged to the forefront of my mind and the gnawing in the back of my mind changed into relief and then tied everything in my head together with a nice bow on top as I remembered exactly why she was familiar and who she was.

“His eyes!” The younger of the guards drew his sword and my priorities immediately changed as I looked at him.

“Again!” the third and final royal guard chose to speak up at last, her voice also sounding on the younger side but no less eager than her male counterpart to fight as she also drew her sword.

The two younger guards charged forward while the third stayed by the queen’s side and called after them to stop, but it was too late, the young man had already committed to the attack even if he wanted to stop, he wouldn’t have been able to prevent the blows from doing some form of damage.

*Good, let them come.*

*Why? Fighting them will only ensure they won’t give us shelter?*

*Us? Who is us?*

Before my internal monologue could go any farther, I reacted to the armored man, bending my knees and leaning forward slipping under his slash and sliding into his guard, I stood to full height abruptly, knocking him off balance while he was still extended out in his attack. This left me standing to his right while my arm looped under his arm and grabbed at the metal that covered his collarbone before wrapping my leg behind his and ripping it out from under him allowing me to slam him into the ground hard. When he hit the dirt the metal of his armor shrieked in some places and crunched in others, but he did not move an inch other than that of his chest rising and falling with his unconscious breathing.

The young woman hesitated for only a moment when her colleague hit the dirt but soon was lunging for my neck as well.

*She’s overextended much like the boy, sloppy.*

She made to stab me through the throat while mid stride, I quickly batted the flat of her blade with my right hand to knock it off course allowing it to slide harmlessly over my left shoulder, then using her momentum against her I stepped forward to meet her halfway and add more power to my own strike as I drove my right elbow into the chain Maille between her breast plate and helmet landing it directly on her throat. The move knocked her off her feet and made me stumble for a moment as all of the inertia of a heavier opponent was transferred to me. As she hit the ground the air was well and truly driven from her lungs, she rolled over onto her side and clutched her throat barely managing to breathe but still getting some airflow.

I turned back to the final guard and prepared for his attack, but it never came as the world warped around me, everything suddenly gained a honey gold and rose red tinge and seemed to be melting around me into darkness. My balance left me and I began stumbling, swaying this way and that trying to regain my footing before I felt a stabilizing hand on my arm, I looked to see who had grabbed me but the world was too twisted for me to see properly, the only thing I could see were warm brown eyes, a small scar on one cheek, a crown, and a devious smile, like that of a trickster. I tried to pull away, but my strength had all but left me as well. Her smile softened at my attempt before she pulled me gently towards her, unable to regain my balance I might as well have been thrown at her as I stumbled but she looped her arms under my shoulders and supported me for a moment before she leaned down and whispered into my ear.

“Come find me next time, yes? Maybe you can answer some of my questions and I can answer yours over tea, yes?” Her tone was light and teasing as she was clearly amused, but I also heard a tinge of something darker that I couldn’t quite place, but I was sure, regardless of her tone and how she worded it, she was not asking.

“Wwwwhhhhhoooo…….” As a final bit of salt in the wound my words failed me as the color drained from the world around me and I began to feel weightless, my head swam, and everything began shrinking around me and she began easing me down to the ground.

“Don’t worry about that for now sweetie, just worry about what, and all you need to know is what I am is your ally. Alright?” Her tone was soft and seemed to dig into my brain.

“Now this may sting a bit but its for your own good. I hope you can forgive me for what I’m about to do.” Her words were soft and sweet like honey while also alarming as the world narrowed down to a small coin before me, I could see a glint of silver and an electric blue glow before the nerves in my left arm lit up and felt like I had just stuck my arm up to my elbow into a woodchipper. I couldn’t hear myself if I cried out but the last thing I heard and saw before it all went black was her voice reassuring me the pain was over and it wouldn’t happen again, and a small flow of blood running down my left hand.

The breakup happened suddenly without any warning during my battle with a severe illness. He never revealed his feelings about our split.

I know it's over, but all I wanted was an acknowledgement that the relationship meant something to him. I expressed this to him the minute we broke up but he went total radio silent on me. I don't know how he felt or how he feels about what happened. But we'd known each other since we were teenagers. 

The breakup just felt... unusually cold. Lacking in the emotional consideration you'd show a person you were with for 6 years and lived with for two. We had even talked about marriage at some point.

Mia Turner stood frozen at the entrance to the living room, her fingers clutching the strap of her work bag. Her sister Lily had interrupted her while she was getting ready, insisting their mother had something important to discuss. 

“Mia, sit down,” her mother, Mary Turner, ordered, lounging on the worn-out sofa like a queen holding court. Her bright red lipstick clashed with the faded blush on her face, her manicured nails tapping against her wine glass.

“Can’t this wait? I have work,” Mia replied, her voice tight. “I can’t afford to be late again.”

Her mother raised an eyebrow. “Work? You mean playing servant to those rich snobs at Casa Lounge? Please.”

Mia bit her tongue. She knew better than to rise to the bait. She needed this job. Casa Lounge wasn’t just a paycheck; it was her lifeline, the first step in her plan to save enough money to leave Willowcrest and the stigma of being a Turner behind.

Ethan, her older brother, sat slouched in the corner, scrolling through his phone. His indifference to the chaos of their family was almost admirable. At least he stayed out of the endless bickering.

“What’s this about, Mom?” Mia asked, her patience slipping.

Mary’s lips curled into a smile. “We have good news.”

Mia blinked, skeptical. “Good news?”

“Yes!” Lily, the eldest, jumped in, practically glowing with excitement. “I got a golden invite to the Willowcrest Unicorn Party!”

Mia blinked again, slower this time, trying to process how this was supposed to be good news. The Unicorn Party—the most exclusive, over-the-top event for the rich and powerful—was as far removed from her world as the moon.

“And this is good news… how?” Mia asked, genuinely baffled.

“Attending will be nice though,” Ethan muttered without looking up from his phone.

“Nice?!” Lily’s voice rose an octave. “Do you have any idea what this means? The richest bachelors in the world will be there! This is it!”

“And how did your name end up on the list?” Mia asked, her tone sharper than she intended.

“Connections,” Mary said smugly, swirling her wine.

Mia didn’t want to dig deeper into what kind of “connections” her mother was referring to. She knew the answer wouldn’t be pleasant.

“Okay, so Lily’s going to some fancy party. What does that have to do with me?” Mia asked, checking the time on her phone. She really couldn’t afford to be late.

Mary leaned forward, her voice dropping into a conspiratorial tone. “This is our chance, Mia. Lily just needs to catch the eye of the right man. A billionaire. Someone who can change all our lives.”

Mia resisted the urge to roll her eyes. Of course, it was another one of her mother’s schemes. Everything in Mary Turner’s life revolved around chasing rich men, and her daughters were no exception.

“I’m happy for Lily,” Mia said flatly, rising to leave. “Congratulations and good luck with the party. I have to go.”

“Sit down, Mia,” Mary snapped, her tone sharpening.

“I can’t be late—”

“Sit!”

Reluctantly, Mia dropped back onto the couch, glancing at the clock on the wall. She was already cutting it too close.

“Listen, you all know how much we suffer and lose after that old bastard put me in Jail. This is a one time opportunity that will change our lives forever”

“ How does that even concern me? Or did the whole family get invited?”

“You wish…” Lily said with snort. “ No one is inviting you to that kind of party with that face”

Ethan chuckles, pulling eyes to him

“Lily you have to stop pretending, like Mia isn't the prettiest in this family” Ethan said, eyes still fixed on his phone.

“Eww, don't say it like that you're my brother” Mia smiles, always trying to get under his brother's skin

“Did I mention she is the most stupid?”

“I try”

“Enough both of you” Mary scolds

“I seriously need to get to work mom, whatever this is obviously doesn't concern me”

“Always so proud talking about it, like it's a real job?” Anna, the middle sister, said with a snide laugh.

“At least I’m doing something!” Mia snapped.

Before the argument could escalate further, Mary’s phone buzzed. She checked the screen, a sly smile spreading across her face. “Same time, same place, Barry? I’ll be there,” she said into the phone, her voice dripping with seduction.

Mia felt a wave of disgust wash over her. She didn’t need to guess what the call was about. It was her mother’s usual business—entertaining some wealthy man in exchange for cash, gifts, or favors.

As Mary hung up, she turned her attention back to Mia. “The point is, we all need to contribute to get your sister everything she needs for that party. You included.”

“This is ridiculous mom! Count me out,” Mia said, her voice steely.

Mary’s eyes narrowed. “Don’t be selfish, Mia. This is for the family.”

“I don't have have money”

“Yes you do” Anna rushed to say. “You've been saving a lot of money for college.”

“Like you said college”

“This is more than college and I've told you a thousand times you're a Turner you have no business with College” Mary says, checking her phone.

“ And I have said it a million times, I'm not like you! I don't want to be like you, I don't want to sit around and wait for some rich guy to come change my life”

“So you think you're better than us now?”

“Oh my god! I'm leaving. Lily I'm sure you can sort yourself out, and if you do get your billionaire boyfriend or husband remember not to give me a dime from his money”

Mia grabs her bag and heads for the door.

College in another country is her way out, no one is jeopardizing that for her.

There's nothing she wants than to leave this town, remove the curse name she bears from her existence.

“Oh you're a Turner, never mind”

“You're a Turner you have no say”

“Girl you're a Turner”

“You're Turner Shut up and open your legs”

“Not a Turner trying to form modesty”

# Chosen For The Game

Alexander Blackwell was known for many things in Willowcrest: his wealth, his looks, his reputation as the bad boy every story tried to capture, but never quite could. Patience, however, wasn’t on the list. Yet, for Zoe Harrington—his girlfriend—he tried. Tried being the word.

Casa Lounge was his usual spot in the evenings, the perfect escape before his underground matches. Tonight, though, he wasn’t supposed to be here. He had a fight in less than two hours, but it was Zoe’s birthday. And Zoe got what Zoe wanted—most of the time.

He sat back in his booth, swirling his glass of whiskey lazily as he watched Zoe talking to a new face in Willowcrest, her glittery dress hugging her like a second skin. She was shamelessly rubbing her body on him—Dickson, or whatever his name was. A new face in Willowcrest, clearly is unaware of who Alexander was.

The sight didn’t bother him; nothing Zoe did ever truly got under his skin. Their relationship thrived on chaos. He smirked, watching her antics, amused more than anything else. She was testing him, as always.

When Zoe finally realized her games weren’t ruffling his feathers, she walks over to him, her pout on full display.

“You don’t even get jealous anymore,” she whined, plopping down beside him.

Alexander looked up from his glass, his voice calm and cool. “What do you want me to do, break some poor guy’s nose?”

Her pout deepened. “When did you even start caring about people?”

“I don’t.”

“Exactly my point!” She crossed her arms, glaring. “You’re so… boring now.”

Alexander hummed in response, his attention flicking toward the crowd again. But then his gaze caught on someone. A Turner.

There she was laughing with her coworker at the bar. Her smile lit up her otherwise simple features, her uniform crisp and modest.The sight of her irritates him.

He did consider asking his friend that owns the place to fire her when they first employed her.

“Man, why would you employ a Turner?”

“She's pretty”

“Still a Turner”

“Won't be one when her pretty lips are wrapped around my dick”

“Seriously?”

“Come on I want to have a taste of all of them”

He blinks back to reality, jaw tensed. He knew all about the Turners. Everyone in Willowcrest did. A family that had no business staying in this town.

“I feel like our spark is dying.”

Alexander sighed, half-listening as he took another sip of his drink. “You say that every day, babe.”

“I mean it this time. I think we need… more games.”

He raised a brow, setting his glass down. “Games? Zoe, we did threesomes the entire month of October. What’s left?”

She leaned forward, pressing her lips against his, her tone dropping to a playful whisper. “I want us to go extreme this time.”

He tilted his head, watching her with mild amusement. “You’re insane.”

“We both are.” She smiled sweetly, her eyes glinting with mischief.

He sighed, leaning back. “What’s your big idea this time?”

“We break up for a month,” she began, her smile widening. “We each date someone new. You sleep with them, I sleep with mine.”

Alexander stared at her, incredulous. “You’ve officially lost it.”

“Oh, come on! It’ll be fun,” Zoe pressed. “It’s not like we don’t always find our way back to each other.”

“And what’s the benefit of this game? Or is this just your twisted idea of fun?”

“To spice up our relationship!” she said as though it were obvious. “And—” she added with a wink—“you’ll be saying no to my birthday present if you don’t agree.”

“Thought you wanted a shopping spree in Paris?” he drawled.

She waved it off. “Changed my mind.”

Alexander sighed, rubbing his temple. “Fine.”

Zoe practically squealed, climbing into his lap to kiss him. “Thank you, baby!”

“I’m already regretting this,” he muttered against her lips.

“Okay, okay, let’s pick!” Zoe said, bouncing excitedly. Her eyes darted around the lounge. “Not her. Not her. Oh—her!”

Alexander followed her gaze, his glass pausing mid-air. His eyes landed on Mia Turner, and he nearly choked on his drink.

“A Turner?” he asked in disbelief.

Zoe nodded enthusiastically. “Yup. I heard she’s different from her sisters. Lucas even tried to get with her, and she turned him down. Can you imagine? She might actually give you a challenge.”

Alexander shook his head firmly. “I’m not getting anywhere near a Turner, Zoe.”

“But she’s pretty,” Zoe argued.

“She’s still a Turner.”

“Alex, please?”

“No Zoe I’m not putting my dick into a Turner “

Zoe pouted, turning her attention to her nails. “Fine. If you’re not going to play, fine. But I guess my birthday’s ruined.”

Alexander groaned. As twisted as their relationship was, he loved Zoe. They’d grown up together, transitioning from childhood friends to lovers. And while she drove him insane, he couldn’t imagine life without her.

“Fine,” he finally relented.

Zoe lit up, throwing her arms around his neck. “Yes! Thank you, baby! Okay, now your turn. Pick someone for me.”

Alexander leaned back, scanning the room. His eyes landed on Jeremy—a local businessman and soon-to-be groom. A wicked smirk curved his lips. “Him.”

Zoe frowned. “Jeremy? Isn’t he getting married next month?”

“Even better,” Alexander replied smoothly. “Like you said, the game is sweeter if it’s harder to achieve.”

Zoe grinned. “You’re twisted, Alex.”

“I’m a Blackwell babes ?”

# The Proposal

Mia was exhausted. Her legs ached from standing for hours, her head throbbed from the endless stream of demanding customers, and her soul felt drained from another day of pretending to be unbothered. 

Casa Lounge had been bustling tonight, and all she wanted now was to catch the next bus home, crawl into bed, and pray that her mother and siblings were out of the house. She couldn’t deal with them today—not with their drama, their judgment, and their constant reminder of the name she desperately wanted to escape.  

She stood at the bus stop, clutching her bag tightly, watching as headlights passed by, one after the other. The night air was cool, the breeze teasing strands of her hair.

Her thoughts were interrupted by the purr of an engine. Mia looked up, startled, as a sleek black sports car slowed to a stop in front of her. Its headlights bathed her in blinding light. She squinted, taking a step back, ready to bolt if necessary. Nothing good ever came out of expensive cars stopping for people like her.  

The door opened, and out stepped Alexander Blackwell.  

Mia’s breath caught in her throat.  

He wasn’t just handsome; he was devastatingly handsome. Towering with broad shoulders, a face carved like a Greek god, and an aura of confidence that demanded attention, Alexander Blackwell was every bit the enigma he is said to be. His presence was overwhelming, the kind of presence that knocked the air out of your lungs before you even realized it.  

He leaned casually against his car, his gaze fixed on her like he had all the time in the world.  

""Hey,"" he said, his voice smooth and laced with an edge of arrogance.  

Mia blinked, unsure if her brain was playing tricks on her. She glanced behind her, twice, certain there must be someone else he was addressing. Surely, ‘a Blackwell’ couldn’t be talking to her.  

""I’m talking to you, Turner,"" he said, smirking.  

Her mind went blank. All she could do was stammer. ""W-what? Me?""  

""Yup.""  

Mia clutched her bag tighter. She looked at him like he’d just announced the sky was green. ""Why… why are you talking to me?""  

His smirk deepened, and then, without warning, he said, ""Go on a date with me.""  

Mia froze. The words hit her like a thunderclap. Did she hear him right? She blinked rapidly, waiting for the punchline, but his face remained serious, even amused.  

""What?"" she choked out. ""Y-you have a girlfriend.""  

Alexander shrugged, pushing his hands into his pockets. ""Not anymore. We broke up. Check the news, Turner.""  

The casual way he said it made her feel like she’d stepped into some alternate reality. Her mind struggled to catch up.  

""I don’t understand,"" she said, her voice shaky.  

""How much?""  

Mia blinked again. ""What?""  

""I said, how much to go on dates with me?""  

It took her a second to process his words. Her jaw dropped as realization hit her. ""You… you want to pay me to go on dates with you?""  

""Maybe,"" he said, his tone nonchalant, as if he were discussing the weather.  

""Why?"" she demanded, her voice rising in confusion. “ You don’t even know my name!""  

""I know enough, Turner."" 

God! she hates when she's being address like this

Mia felt anger under her exhaustion. Her hands balled into fists at her sides. ""No,"" she said firmly.  

Alexander raised a brow. ""What?""  

""I said no.""  

He tilted his head, genuinely surprised. ""Why?""  

Mia stared at him, incredulous. ""What do you mean, why? You don’t even know me. You’ve never talked to me before. And now you suddenly want to—what?—buy me for dates? When I just saw you yesterday with your girlfriend""  

""Don’t tell me you were watching me, Turner,"" he said, his smirk returning.  

""You wish,"" she snapped.  

""Trust me, that can’t be part of my wishes,"" he said coolly. His eyes glinted with amusement. ""Name your price, Turner.""  

""I said no!"" she spat, her voice firm. ""You can’t just buy people to go on dates with you. I’m not interested.""  

Alexander’s smirk faltered for a split second. He stepped closer, his presence overwhelming, as he stared down at her. ""You’re a Turner,"" he said, his tone dropping. ""Stop acting like you have any pride""  

Her chest tightened, anger bubbling inside her. ""Please, leave me alone,"" she said through gritted teeth.  

He stepped back, his smirk returning like a mask. ""Three dates, Five thousand, for each.""  

Mia’s eyes widened. ""What?""  

""You heard me. Sleep over it, Turner.""  

And just like that, he turned, got into his car, and drove off, leaving her standing there, speechless, her thoughts swirling into chaos.  

“What the hell?”

# The Tempting Offer

Mia barely got any sleep that night. She tossed and turned, replaying the surreal encounter with Alexander Blackwell over and over in her mind. The way he’d looked at her, the arrogance in his tone, the absurdity of his offer—5,000 per date? It felt like a cruel joke, one meant to humiliate her.  

But then the thought of the money would creep back in, unbidden. 5 thousand dollars. For three dates, that will be 15 thousand dollars. It was more money than she could hope to save in years at Casa Lounge. 

15 thousand could pay for a lot, rent, food... It could be her fastest way out of Willowcrest. 

Mia sat up in bed and groaned, running her hands through her hair. No. She shouldn't even entertain the thoughts. 

Whatever game Alexander Blackwell was playing, she wanted no part of it. That money might save her now, but taking money from a Blackwell will definitely come with strings she wasn’t willing to pull. 

By morning, she was still exhausted but determined to stick to her decision. She trudged out of her tiny room and into the kitchen, hoping for some coffee to start her day. As she entered, she heard her sisters talking, their voices low. 

“There's no way it’s real,” Lily was saying, her tone dripping with skepticism.  

“It could be,” Anna shot back, flipping her hair over her shoulder. “People are saying it all over town.”  

“What’s going on?” Mia asked groggily, heading to the cupboard to grab a glass. “Where’s Mom?”  

“Out. Probably won’t be back until God knows when,” Anna replied, not even sparing her a glance.  

“You’re delusional if you think they’ve broken up,” Lily said, laughing. “Zoe would rather chew glass than break up with Blackwell.”  

Mia froze, her hand clutching the glass tightly.  

“Or maybe he broke up with her,” Anna said with a sly smile.  

Lily snorted. “Oh my God, Anna, don’t tell me you’re still holding onto the hope that you’ll get him one day. It’s embarrassing at this point.”  

Mia turned slowly, her stomach sinking as she listened to the exchange.  

“I’m not delusional!” Anna snapped. “And you’re one to talk. At least I tried. Unlike you, who’s too busy chasing any rich guy who gives you a second glance.”  

“‘Tried’ is an understatement,” Lily said, cackling. “Walking around naked in the Blackwell mansion three days after you were employed? Please. That was pathetic.”  

Anna’s face flushed, and she opened her mouth to retort, but Lily kept going.  

“Face it, Anna. We’re Turners. The Blackwells doesn’t even look at us like we’re human. They hate our family’s existence.”  

“Whatever,” Anna huffed, crossing her arms.  

Mia forced herself to move, walking to the sink to pour herself some water. Her hands were shaking, and she prayed neither of them would notice. 

HmmOnce inside, she grabbed her phone from the nightstand and immediately opened the Willowcrest Morning News. There, staring back at her in bold letters, was the headline:  

\*\*Alexander Blackwell and Zoe Harrington Call It Quits.\*\*  

Mia’s heart raced as she read the article. Zoe had confirmed the breakup in an interview the night before, saying they’d decided to take a “break” to focus on themselves. The tone of the article was suspicious, though, hinting at drama behind the scenes.  

Mia put the phone down and leaned against the wall, her mind spinning. Was this why he’d approached her? Because he was single now and needed someone to… what? Fill the void? Become part of his ridiculous games?  

She shook her head.

She couldn’t let herself get sucked into whatever madness was going on.  

Just then, her phone buzzed in her hand. The notification made her stomach drop. She hesitated for a moment before looking at the screen.  

The message was from an unknown number.  

Good morning, Turner. Don’t bother asking how I got your number. My offer still stands: three dates, 5,000 for each one. You have three days to decide.  

Mia stared at the message, her heart pounding in her chest. Her fingers trembled as she read it again. She could practically hear his voice in the text, that cool, arrogant tone that told her he was used to getting exactly what he wanted.  

For a moment, she considered deleting the message, pretending it never existed. But instead, she sank onto the edge of her bed, clutching her phone tightly.  

Fifteen thousand dollars.  

Her mind raced with possibilities. She could finally afford to leave Willowcrest, start fresh. 

But then the image of Alexander Blackwell’s smirk flashed in her mind, and anger bubbled to the surface.  

Three days

# The Blackwells

The Blackwell mansion loomed like a dark, silent predator as Alex walks up the marble steps and pushed through the heavy doors. 

The house was grand—but it felt nothing like a home. 

Dinner here wasn’t about family bonding; it was a calculated performance, one Alex hated but endured because his mother and brother were involved. The only two people who ground him to this dysfunctional circus. Well… them, and Zoe.  

He walked into the dining room, his steps echoing against the polished floors. His family was already seated, the tension visible before a single word was spoken.  

“What’s this nonsense I hear about you and Zoe?” his father, Charles Blackwell, demanded without so much as looking up. His tone was sharp and cold, like a blade slicing through the air.  

Alex didn’t falter, didn’t blink. He slid into his seat with a practiced ease, his face carefully neutral. “Good evening, Father,” he replied smoothly, ignoring the obvious jab.  

“Did you ice that cut, darling?” His mother, Esther, leaned forward, her soft features tight with concern. Her gaze flicked to the small wound on his temple from his most recent underground fight.  

Alex waved her off. “It’s fine, Mother.”  

“I can’t believe you let a rookie do that to you,” Charles sneered, his voice filled with disdain.  

“I won, Father,” Alex said, his voice edged with amusement. “That’s what matters, isn’t it?”  

Charles’s lips curled into a snarl. “You think this is a joke? I told you to postpone your fights for the week. Investors are flying in tomorrow, and you’re moving around, looking like some street thug. Do you realize the stakes? We could lose millions!”  

Alex leaned back in his chair, completely unfazed. “And yet I made sweet money last night from fighting. Your priorities are not mine, Father.”  

Charles’s gaze darkened. Without warning, he grabbed Julian’s wrist and slammed it onto the table.  

Alex stiffened.  

Julian, his older brother, winced, his lips trembling as he fought to suppress any sound of pain. Alex’s stomach twisted as he watched the familiar scene unfold.  

Charles Blackwell wasn’t a father. He was a tyrant, a monster! A manipulator who thrived on power and control, and when Alex pushed his limits, it was always Julian or his mother who bore the brunt of his wrath.  

“Do you think this is a game, Alexander?” Charles hissed, pressing harder on Julian’s hand.  

Julian’s eyes were shut tight, his breath uneven, but he didn’t cry out. He never did. 

Once, Julian had been Alex’s hero—the older brother who could do no wrong. Now he was a shadow of that man, a hollowed-out shell who survived on drugs.’  

Alex’s jaw clenched, rage boiling beneath the surface. His mother’s wide, pleading eyes locked on him, silently begging him to do something.  

Alex forced himself to keep his tone calm. “I’ll handle the investors,” he said, his words precise and deliberate. “It won’t affect the meeting. You’ll get the contract.”  

Charles finally let go of Julian’s hand, leaning back in his chair with a satisfied smirk. “Good. That’s what I like to hear.”  

Julian pulled his hand back quickly, cradling it under the table. His face was pale, but he didn’t say a word.  

Alex wanted to slam his fist through the table, but he didn’t. That’s what Charles wanted—to provoke him, to control him.  

Instead, Alex picked up his phone and scrolled aimlessly, pretending to care about the plate of food in front of him.  

“Fix whatever mess you’ve made with Zoe,” Charles added, his tone icy. “Her father and I are already discussing the wedding date. I won’t have your antics ruining our alliance.”  

Alex smirked, though it didn’t reach his eyes. “Of course, Father,” he said, not looking up. He couldn’t exactly tell Charles the truth” 

His mind drift to that server girl 

Turner—the fiery server girl who’d told him off at the bus stop. He hated to admit it, but her rejection had stung. Most people in Willowcrest would’ve jumped at his offer, yet she’d turned him down without a second thought.  

Something about her had gotten under his skin.  

“Did you hear me, Alexander?” Charles barked, snapping him out of his thoughts.  

Alex slipped his phone into his pocket and stood abruptly. “Loud and clear, Father. Enjoy your dinner, Blackwells.”  

Without another word, he strode out of the dining room.  

The cold night air hit him like a slap as he stepped outside. He leaned against his sleek car, running a hand through his hair. He needed to cool off.  

His phone buzzed in his pocket.  

Pulling it out, he glanced at the screen, his heart drops. It was a text message, and it was from Turner.  

‘I’ll do it.’

Alex stared at the message, his heart thudding in his chest. For a moment, he didn’t move, didn’t breathe.  

He loves challenges but getting entangled with a Turner is a challenge he had no interest in taking part in.

He wished she had said no.

# Let The Game Begin

The balcony of the Blackwell Grand Hotel overlooked a city alive with wealth, secrets, and power plays. Alex stood with a glass of wine in hand, the chilled night air brushing against his skin. Beside him, Zoe leaned in, her arms draped around his waist as if she were staking a claim.  

""How long do you plan on playing this game?"" He asked.

Zoe chuckled softly, her lips brushing against his ear. ""It's getting very interesting, Alexander. Don’t ruin the fun.""  

He hummed, neither agreeing nor disagreeing, his eyes fixed on the horizon. His thoughts drifted to the server girl.

""I can’t believe she agreed so quickly,"" Zoe said, breaking into his thoughts.  

""I told you, she's a Turner,"" Alex replied, his tone dismissive.  

Zoe tilted her head, her blonde hair cascading over her shoulder as she studied him. ""Seriously, babe, bribing her with money should be considered cheating. Where’s the challenge in that?""  

Alex turned his head slightly, giving her a sharp glance. ""No rules against it, Zoe. And what did you expect? That I’d sweet-talk her into a date? Casual conversation with her is painful enough. I offered what Turners are slaves to—the one thing they respond to."" His lips curled into a smirk. ""And like the perfect bait, she took it.""  

Zoe shivered, but not from the cold. Her smile widened, her eyes glittering with mischief. ""God, babe, your hatred for them gives me chills. I mean, I get it. You should hate them, but... it’s not like the whole family wronged you. Her brother was the only one who got involved with Julian.""  

Alex’s expression hardened, his sharp jawline tightening. His voice was cold and deliberate. ""And what is her brother, Zoe?""  

""A Turner,"" she whispered with a wicked smile, clearly pleased with his reaction. ""But babe, I have to admit—watching you squirm every time you talk about her makes this game so much more entertaining. Your pain and discomfort? Pure gold.""  

Alex didn’t respond. He drained the rest of his wine and turned his gaze back to the city, his thoughts darker than the night sky.  

—

Mia stood behind the bar at Casa Lounge, wiping down glasses and trying to ignore the twisting in her stomach. It had been two days since she’d last seen Alexander Blackwell, and she wasn’t sure if the relief or disappointment was stronger.

His message still lingered in her mind, taunting her.

Three dates. Five thousand per date.

It wasn’t normal. Nothing about it was normal. What kind of man paid that much money for a date? Who even pays for a date?

She paused mid-wipe, her reflection in the glass catching her attention. She didn’t need this kind of chaos in her life.

The door to Casa Lounge swung open. Mia turned her head and froze.

Alexander Blackwell

He wasn’t alone. His two friends, Lucas and Sam, flanked him, laughing at something she couldn’t hear. But Alex’s gaze was locked on her the moment he entered the bar.

Mia felt her heart lurch in her chest, and her hands gripped the counter to keep herself steady. She couldn’t move. She couldn’t look away. He was walking toward her, his dark, commanding presence drawing the eyes of everyone in the lounge.

Her throat went dry as he closed the distance between them.

“Tomorrow after work,” Alex said, his voice low and smooth. “I’ll pick you up.”

That was it. No explanation, no pleasantries. Just a statement delivered with absolute confidence.

Before Mia could find her voice, he turned and walked to the back corner of the lounge, where his friends were already settling into a booth.

Mia exhaled sharply, her grip on the counter tightening. Her knees felt like jelly, and she was sure her face was flushed.

“What was that about?” Emily, her coworker, whispered from behind her, nudging her with an elbow.

“Nothing,” Mia said quickly, her voice shaky.

Emily raised an eyebrow. “Nothing? That was Alexander Blackwell. He doesn’t just walk up to people, Mia.”

“Drop it,” Mia muttered, focusing on the glass in her hand. But her heart was pounding so hard it felt like it might leap out of her chest.

She glanced over at the booth where Alex sat with his friends. He didn’t look her way again, laughing at something his friend had said, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that he was completely aware of her every move.",1,1753676721.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

After sharing a progress photo last week (cheers for the kind messages btw), I had a few DMs asking if I followed a specific plan. 

Truth is, I didn’t follow anything strict. But what did make the difference were lots of micro changes, most of which I barely noticed, but when stacked together over weeks and months, made an impact. 

None of these are revolutionary. Some are obvious. But I figured I’d share the ones that stuck together with a rough calculation of the impact. 

Micro wins. Massive gains (or rather, losses).

None of these made me lose almost 40lbs on their own. But together? They certainly contributed. I should also say I didn’t start with them all - rather maybe 5-6 and then added as it felt sustainable and with the helpful googling changes online.

1mb6pg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HonestBuyerReviews/comments/1mb6pg8/haier_240l_fridge_review_solid_buy_or_just_hype/,Haier 240L Fridge Review – Solid Buy or Just Hype?,"So I’ve been using the **Haier HEF-252EGS-P (240L, 2-Star, Frost-Free Double Door Refrigerator)** for a few months now, and if you're someone considering a no-nonsense fridge under ₹25K with enough space for a small family... let me save you hours of overthinking.

This fridge isn’t flashy. No convertibility gimmicks, no digital touch panels, no smart WiFi nonsense. But it **gets the job done** .... quietly, efficiently, and without making you feel like you settled for less.

👉 [**Check today’s price on Amazon — it usually hovers around ₹22K–₹25K**](https://www.amazon.in/Haier-Double-Refrigerator-HEF-252EGS-P-Silver/dp/B0BTHLGVQ6?tag=rahulbhatia-21)

# What You’re Getting (And What You’re Not)

* **Capacity**: 240 Litres – Easily fits groceries for 2–4 people
* **Energy Rating**: 2-Star (2024) – Not the best, but not brutal either
* **Cooling Type**: Frost-Free (no manual defrosting ever = major win)
* **Compressor**: Normal, non-inverter – Slight hum but nothing annoying
* **Freezer on Top** – Traditional layout, works well
* **Finish**: Moon Silver – Matte-ish finish, looks clean and doesn’t catch too many fingerprints
* **Build**: Toughened glass shelves, solid door compartments, doesn’t feel cheap at all

# Real-Life Use ....What I’ve Noticed

**- Cooling**

Zero complaints. Cools quickly, keeps veggies crisp, and I’ve never had to mess with the temperature settings beyond the first week. The freezer chills fast ... frozen peas, ice trays, and even a big pack of paneer stay in perfect condition.

**- Space**

It’s surprisingly spacious for a 240L fridge. Easily fits 2L bottles, milk packets, leftovers, and a full stack of dabbas. I thought I’d run out of space with guests over, but it held up like a champ.

**- Noise**

Yes, it makes a light humming sound. No, it won’t drive you nuts. It blends into the background within a day or two.

**- Power Consumption**

It’s a **2-star fridge**, so it’s not the most energy-efficient — but the difference hasn’t been wild on my electricity bill. If you’re a heavy user or super power-conscious, you might want to look at a 3-star model, but otherwise this is manageable.

**- Looks & Design**

The **Moon Silver** finish is actually super sleek. It’s not glossy, so it doesn’t get dirty fast. And the handle design feels sturdy. Overall, looks way more premium than what the price tag suggests.

# Pros (Why I’d Recommend It)

* Solid cooling performance
* Spacious layout without being bulky
* No manual defrost drama
* Feels sturdy and well-built
* Sleek, modern design that blends into most kitchens
* Affordable for a frost-free double door

# Cons (Let’s Keep It Real)

* 2-Star rating isn’t ideal if you're chasing long-term savings
* No inverter = slightly more power usage + light humming
* No convertible/freezer-to-fridge option (didn’t matter to me, but might for some)

# Final Verdict: Happy With It? 100%

If you’re looking for a **reliable, mid-sized double door fridge under ₹25K**, this is a rock-solid pick. It’s perfect for:

* Couples or small families
* First-time buyers
* People upgrading from a single-door fridge
* Anyone who doesn’t need fancy “smart” features but wants **performance + durability**

It’s one of those rare buys where **you get exactly what you pay for ... and maybe a little more**.

The coffee industry, with its vast global reach, is no exception. A significant move towards sustainability in coffee packaging is the use of biodegradable coffee bags, which are playing a pivotal role in helping coffee brands reduce their environmental impact.

One of the biggest challenges faced by coffee brands is the waste generated by their packaging. Traditional coffee bags, often made from plastic or non-recyclable materials, take hundreds of years to break down, contributing to pollution and landfill waste. Biodegradable coffee bags offer a more sustainable alternative. These bags are typically made from materials such as plant-based plastics, compostable films, or recycled paper, which can break down naturally over time without leaving harmful residues.

Switching to biodegradable coffee bags offers a variety of environmental benefits. For starters, they reduce the amount of plastic waste entering landfills and oceans. Since these bags break down more quickly than their plastic counterparts, they help to decrease long-term pollution. Moreover, many biodegradable bags are made from renewable resources, further minimizing the carbon footprint of coffee packaging.

In addition to environmental benefits, biodegradable coffee bags also cater to the growing consumer demand for eco-friendly products. Shoppers are becoming more conscious of their purchasing decisions, opting for brands that align with their values of sustainability and environmental responsibility. Coffee brands that adopt biodegradable packaging not only help the planet but also strengthen their connection with eco-conscious consumers.

These bags are not only good for the environment but also for preserving the coffee’s freshness. Biodegradable coffee bags often come with high-quality sealing and protective features, ensuring that the coffee inside stays fresh for longer without compromising on taste or aroma. This makes them an attractive option for coffee brands looking to maintain product quality while also promoting sustainability.

While the adoption of biodegradable coffee bags is still growing, it is a positive step in the right direction. It shows that businesses in the coffee industry are taking responsibility for their environmental impact and are committed to finding innovative solutions. As more brands make the switch, biodegradable coffee bags could become the norm, helping the coffee industry significantly reduce its ecological footprint.

In conclusion, **biodegradable coffee bags** are a game-changer in the coffee industry’s move towards sustainability. They provide a practical solution to reduce waste, support eco-friendly consumer choices, and preserve the freshness of coffee—all while contributing to a greener, cleaner planet.",1,1753676365.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Twins vs. Red Sox: A Slugging Showdown with a Side of Sarcasm**

The Minnesota Twins (-126) and Boston Red Sox (+108) collide in a battle of contrasting slugging percentages, underdog grit, and enough run-heavy histories to make a soda addict blush. Let’s unpack this like a over-caffeinated sportswriter who’s just discovered that “statcast” isn’t a new coffee flavor.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Numbers That Won’t Hit Back

The Twins, favored at -126, have a 52.2% win rate when they’re the favorite—about the same chance of correctly guessing “Mystery Meat Night” at a buffet. Their .400 slugging percentage is 16th in MLB, which is *okay* if you’re trying to avoid a .100 team, but not great if you want to make the playoffs. The Red Sox, meanwhile, are a +108 underdog with a fifth-ranked .426 slugging percentage. They’ve also won 17 of 39 games as underdogs this season—like the baseball version of that friend who always “snakes” the best seat at the movies.

The total is set at 9.5 runs, and both teams have combined to go *over* the total 42-49 times this year. This isn’t a game; it’s a fireworks show where the starters are the sparklers and the bullpens are the Roman candles.

---

### Key Players: Stars or Supporting Roles?

**Twins:** Byron Buxton is their golden boy, leading the team in batting average, home runs, and RBIs. If Buxton’s at bat is a popcorn kernel, the Twins’ offense is a bag that’s 90% unpopped—loud, sporadic, and occasionally a finger hazard.

**Red Sox:** Jarren Duran is hitting .259 but has 26 doubles, 12 triples, and nine home runs. That’s like a Swiss Army knife of hitting—versatile, occasionally dangerous, and always leaving you wondering why he isn’t in the All-Star game. Trevor Story and Ceddanne Rafaela round out Boston’s “we-can-still-hit-the-ball” crew, though their combined presence is less “atomi

1mb6ll7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1mb6ll7/tw_i_violated_thirtyseven_corpses_my_wife_only/,[TW] I violated thirty-seven corpses. My wife only caught the last one.,"What's a viral title for reddit for this story Still and Beautiful 

They always look so peaceful at first. That’s what drew me in. The stillness. The silence. The way they surrendered completely to gravity, to time. No judgment. No questions. No resistance. The living never stop asking for something. Smiles. Manners. Apologies. They need you to be normal. They need you to lie. But the dead, The dead never ask. They offer.

I run the prep room alone. My wife handles the front: flowers, families, caskets. She’s the smile. I’m the scalpel. She says it’s better this way. That I have a gift. I tell her she’s right. She has no idea.

It started with a boy. Ten years old, maybe less. Hit by a drunk driver. His skull had caved slightly on one side. They wheeled him in zipped up in a cheap black bag, but when I opened it, he looked like he was sleeping mid-sentence. Mouth ajar. One eye barely open. I cleaned him. I stitched the wound behind his ear. I filled out the hollow in his cheek with wax, pressed makeup into it with a sponge. But when I was done… I didn’t move. I just stood there, staring at him. My hand rested on his chest too long. I leaned in and kissed his forehead. It was cold. Firm. Slightly sticky from the embalming fluid. That kiss changed everything. Something inside me unfurled. A craving. A realization. A truth I couldn’t un-know. I didn’t want to fix him. I wanted to keep him.

From then on, I stopped seeing bodies. I saw offerings. Age meant nothing. Gender, nothing. Cause of death: accident, suicide, overdose. It didn’t matter.

There was a girl, sixteen, who’d hung herself in her bedroom closet. She still had faint ligature marks, like pink shadows under her jaw. Her tongue swollen, teeth gritted. I cleaned the urine from her thighs, straightened her fingers. Her skin was still warm when I slid her blouse off. There was an old man whose tub had filled with blood when he slipped and cracked his head open. Half his skull was gone. I spent hours reassembling it like a puzzle. By the time I was done, I felt proud. Intimate. Like I’d rebuilt a lover from memory. There was a newborn. Blue. Silent. Skin like tissue paper. Still wrapped in a hospital blanket with cartoon giraffes. I unwrapped him slowly. Held him like something sacred. Each one had a different energy. A different weight. A different smell. Some had traces of shampoo. Others still carried the metallic scent of blood, bile, formaldehyde. But they all had one thing in common: They let me in.

I whispered to them while I worked. Sometimes sweet things. Other times, dark confessions. Words I never said to the living.

“I love you.”

“You’re safe.”

“You’re mine now.”

I had rituals. Candles. Gloves off. The lights dimmed to something soft, respectful. I moved slow, deliberate, savoring every inch of them. Not every night went far. But some did. When the craving built too high. When I couldn’t just look or touch or whisper, I gave in. The skin gives way differently after death. It doesn’t fight. It stretches. Tears. Accepts. They let me have them. Fully. Quietly. Without shame.

I kept things. Pieces. Not trophies, just reminders. Hair, braided and tied. A fingernail, pale and curved like a moon sliver. A tooth, smooth and perfect. A pair of lips once, cut clean with a scalpel, floated in a jar of preserving fluid. No one suspected. People want to believe the dead are in good hands. I give them the script. Sympathy in my eyes. A slow nod. A firm handshake.

“I’ll take care of them,” I say.

And I do. 

Until the night I slipped. It was late. Rain hammered the roof. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. Everyone else was gone. She was seventeen. Suicide. Wrists like opened fruit. Blood still wet in the folds of her palms. I undressed her. Washed her. Toweled her dry with care. Her eyes had drifted half open, glassy, staring past me. I whispered to her. Called her beautiful. My gloves were off. And that’s when the door creaked. I turned. My wife stood there. Purse in one hand. Her forgotten phone in the other. She didn’t cry. Didn’t scream. She just dropped the phone. It hit the floor with a dull, plastic clack. Soft and final. I said her name. She took one step back. Then another. She didn’t run. She didn’t need to. She called the police. Handed over the footage. She never asked me why. She already knew.

They came the next morning. Arrested me in my kitchen while the coffee percolated. I didn’t resist. What would be the point? They say I violated thirty-seven bodies. But that’s just the count they found. Men. Women. Children. Each one etched into my memory. I still whisper to them at night. Names. Apologies. Devotions. They’re still mine.

Still.

And beautiful.

1mb6kdx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mb6kdx/the_rain_wouldnt_stop/,The rain wouldn't stop,"Several months ago, I made the decision to completely blow up my life. Impulsive, yes. Not well thought out either. If you were to ask me why I did it, I’m not sure I would’ve been able to offer a cogent explanation. I guess I was just feeling trapped. Starting to get tired of it all.

It was a Monday morning. I was on the metro going to work as usual. But when my stop came, I didn’t get up. I remained sitting until the end of the line, arriving in some industrial part of the city I’d never been to. I stood up and walked off the train and onto the platform, breathing in the cool air.

I checked the time on my phone. 8:10 AM. A few minutes later, I got a text from my boss.

*Where are you?*

A message that would’ve usually sent me into a panic. But at that moment I just felt too detached from everything to care. A strange kind of feeling. I guess something in me just snapped. I just didn’t want to deal with it anymore. Going to work and then coming home and studying in the hopes of advancing in a career I couldn’t have cared less about. I’ve been working forever. Going to school forever. Always told myself that somebody I wouldn’t have to anymore. But I’d stopped feeling so sure about that.

I made my way out of the station. With the morning rush settled, it was mostly empty. I chose a street at random and began walking until I found a bar. After a few drinks I was smiling. Not just because of the alcohol. But because it felt like I’d regained some semblance of control.

Later that day, I bought a paper map from a dollar store. Went home and pinned it to my wall then closed my eyes and threw a dart at it. First time it landed in the Pacific Ocean. Second time somewhere in Malaysia. Never been to the country and so I booked the first flight available and flew out a few days later.

I spent a week there. Didn’t have an itinerary or a schedule the entire time. Just kind went wherever the wind would take me. I wandered around, went bar-hopping, tried new foods, made new friends. Slowly I could feel my world begin to open up.

When I got back to my apartment, I threw another dart. Two days later, I was on a flight to Sao Paulo. Then Montreal. One day I got home and found out I’d been evicted. Wasn’t really surprised and it didn’t really matter. I just booked another flight.

I looked over my finances and determined that I had enough savings (that I’d been planning on using as a down payment someday) to keep this going for about another five months. Then a risky night in Macau gave me enough for another three.

Of course, I was still wary about what I’d have to deal with when it all ran out. I’d told my family I was just going on vacation but somehow they’d found out I’d stopped showing up to work. I’d been avoiding picking up their calls but eventually did so, just so they wouldn’t try and file a missing persons report or anything. I explained to them what I’d been doing and it was like a switch had flipped. Any hint of concern in their voices suddenly melted away, replaced by this tone of annoyance, borderline rage. They told me that I was going to regret this. That I was ruining my life. That If I came to my senses and returned home right now maybe they could help me pick up the pieces. I just hung up.

I considered getting odd jobs in various places, which I did for a while. But then I just stopped caring. I should’ve been careful, fearful for the future ahead. But I wasn’t. For the first time in my life, I was free, completely uninhibited. I just wanted to keep riding the wave.

Soon I had visited twenty-two different countries. I’d made more friends, experienced more in those months than I had in my previous twenty-nine years of life. I didn’t want to stop. And I wasn’t going to.

The Netherlands was my twenty-third.

One night I left a house party in Rotterdam with a girl in a blue dress. My mind was hazy, under the influence of a cocktail of different substances. I followed her into dense woods, where she supposedly lived. In retrospect the alarm bells should’ve been going off. In the moment, I just didn’t care.

The trees and brush seemed to grow thicker, more hostile the further we went. We walked for a long while but every time a concern would start to creep into my head, she’d pass me the bottle, give me a look seductive enough to nullify my fears. Even in the darkness, her cold, blue eyes seemed to glisten.

Eventually we arrived at a house in a clearing. I remember entering the place but not much more afterwards.

I woke up the next morning in an empty bedroom. Everything was bathed in a grey, muted light. There was a loud, steady drumming against the windows and the roof. Rainfall.

No idea where the hell I was, but the hangover was nasty enough that I didn’t immediately question it. I looked around the room. Pretty barebones. Other than the bed, there was a small dresser, a mirror, two paintings on separate walls. The closet was open, revealing nothing inside.

The air smelled stale. I could feel traces of dust in my throat and nostrils. I stumbled into the bathroom and threw up for a bit. Then I washed my face with cold water, drinking some of it straight from the faucet.

Then I laid back down, listening to the rain as I tried to piece together what happened the night prior. Memories of the party came back to me in fragments. The music festival I’d been at before that. The breakfast at the hostel. The girl. The woods.

I began looking around for my phone and wallet, relieved to find them on the floor beside the bed, with no cash or cards missing.

After my headache had dulled into something manageable, I got out of bed, left the room.

The hallway was just as empty. Silent. Still no sign of anybody. I called out and got nothing back but a strange echo. As if this place was much bigger than what I could see. I checked the other rooms upstairs. Nothing still. Then I went downstairs and it was the same story.

I sat down on the couch and checked my phone to see if I’d taken down a number, somebody I could call. But it didn’t seem that way. The last message I received was from some dude I’d met at the festival earlier. Nothing that could’ve been from the girl in the blue dress.

I found it strange just how much faith she must’ve had in me to leave me in her place alone like this. But I guess it was mostly empty anyways. Not much to steal.

And then that cautious part of my brain lit up. What if this wasn’t actually her place? What if I’d just been led into a really bad situation? I stood up and raced to the front door, taking a deep sigh of relief when I realized I could open it.

The front porch was decorated with a few potted plants and two old rocking chairs, white paint peeling off of them. The air outside had a pleasant sweetness to it. Something almost calming to breathe in.

But the rain was a different story. It was chaotic. Oppressive, even. Pouring harder than I’d ever seen it pouring anywhere before, the ceaseless deluge of droplets smacking the ground producing a near-deafening wall of noise. I’d never heard about a hurricane hitting the Netherlands, and this didn’t seem to be one. Because there was no wind. The rain was coming down in a completely straight line. No thunder or lightning either.

It was difficult to make out any of the surroundings, though I could still tell I was surrounded by woods. I squinted ahead, eventually spotting the clearing we’d come through. But the idea of venturing out and trying to find my way through the forest in conditions like this sounded God-awful. I decided to go back inside, wait it out.

It wouldn’t have been so bad if I could just scroll through Instagram or something, but my phone battery was sitting at around only 25% and I hadn’t been able to find a charger. I didn’t want to be stuck out here with a dead phone.

So I decided to explore the house instead.

There really wasn’t much to note. If I had to guess when it was built, I’d say maybe twenty years ago. Nothing close to modern but not exactly ancient feeling either. It actually reminded me of my childhood home in the suburbs.

Upstairs there were three bedrooms and two bathrooms. Sounds like a lot of space but the layout was pretty tight, not a lot of space between.

Making up the downstairs area was a living room, a kitchen, a small laundry room. And then one more room behind a locked wooden door. Could’ve led down to a basement. Or maybe it was just a closet. Not that I really cared. I just wanted the rain to stop.

I didn’t how it was possible, but it only seemed to be ramping up. I checked the weather app, but it claimed that Rotterdam was only partly cloudy, with a 5% chance of precipitation. Nothing about extremely heavy rainfall in the news, either.

I shook my head, feeling the confusion and frustration beginning to proliferate. This was insane. I went back upstairs, looking through every closet in the hopes of finding a rain jacket, an umbrella, something that could give me a fighting chance.

But there was jack shit. I checked the time. Two past noon.

*Fuck it*, I thought. I’ll just try and brave it. See how far I can get.

I did find something at least a little bit useful in the kitchen – a full, unopened box of garbage bags. I turned one into a makeshift jacket, using a knife I found in the drawer to cut out head and arm holes. Then I fashioned another one into a hood. I used a third to wrap tightly around my phone to minimize any water damage. Then I ventured out.

And I didn’t get far. The second there was no longer a roof covering my head, it felt like I was drowning. The bags really didn’t do much to help. Every second I was forced to wipe water from my eyes, making it nearly impossible to tell where the hell I was going.

The forest floor had turned into a muddy swamp, my shoes pulling up heavy clumps of wet Earth after every step. I was cold, uncomfortable, slowly losing my shit. But I was still determined to press forward.

That was until I saw the people standing at the edge of the clearing.

I had to do a double take. I really hadn’t noticed them at first. Almost as if they’d just suddenly appeared.

Should’ve been good news, right? There were people around. Maybe one of them could help me out.

But the details didn’t support that conclusion. There were a staggering amount of them, what appeared to be dozens. All just standing there. Perfectly still. They could’ve been mannequins.

I stood in place, waiting for one of them to say something. Waiting for any kind of reaction at all. I tried making out their faces, what they were wearing, though the rain made it difficult. The only thing I was reasonably sure about was that their frames were tall and slender and that their skin was strangely pale, devoid of any color at all.

Then I started wondering why I was able to notice this. Why I was able to see a perfect outline of their bodies.

They were naked, I realized. All of them. From head to toe.

I turned, began scrambling back towards the house. That’s when I saw more. They were scattered along every inch of the clearing. All pale, naked, just standing stationary between the trees. The house was completely surrounded by them.

I slipped and fell about four times before I finally made it back inside. My entire body was soaked, my legs, arms and back slick with mud.

I was shaking my head, really not wanting to accept whatever the fuck was happening.

This was a dream, I tried to convince myself. A really, fucked up vivid dream.

*Wake up then. Motherfucker, wake up.*

I waited for a long time before accepting that I wouldn’t.

I looked through a window. The pale figures were still there. It didn’t look like they’d moved at all.

I pulled out my phone. According to the weather app, it was now mostly sunny. 0% precipitation.

This was all too much. I was panicking and decided it was worth dialing 112, the emergency line in the EU. The signal wasn’t great, but I still managed to get through.

I tried explaining to the operator what was happening in a way that made me seem the least insane. I’m in a house in the woods. Heavy rain outside. Strange, potentially malicious people surrounding me.

After I’d finished speaking, there came a long silence on the other end.

*I sound like a lunatic,* I thought to myself. *She thinks I’m crazy*. I looked through the window again. The figures were still there.

But maybe it was a good thing if I she thought I was crazy.

“You need to send somebody over,” I said. “I don’t know the address. I don’t know where I am. Send somebody over. Send somebody now,” I paused. “I really need to get the fuck out of here.”

Eventually I heard her sigh.

“I’m sorry. I can’t do that,” she said. Her voice sounded shaky, as if she were on the verge of tears.

“Why?” I asked her. “Can’t you trace the call or something? Anything?”

“I’m sorry,” she repeated. “We won’t be able to find you.”

I asked her what she meant.”

“It’s happened before. We searched the woods for weeks. For the house that you’re in. But we were never able to find it.”

I stammered for a bit, suddenly unable to find any words.

“Listen to me,” she continued. “I believe you. Everything you’ve said. The first time I got a call about it, I didn’t. But it’s happened enough now that I know something’s going on. But stay calm. Don’t panic. Just listen carefully.”

My head was starting to spin. I didn’t know how to react to that. But I obliged. I told her that I’d listen. Because what the fuck else could I do?

“You’re not doomed,” she told me. “Eventually the rain will stop. It might not seem possible right now, but you need to be patient. Don’t lose your head. Do not panic. You need to be as lucid as possible. Because when the rain does stop, you need to run like hell. You’ll have to run for a long time. But don’t stop. You might hear something chasing after you. Don’t stop until you’re out of the forest, completely free from the woods. They won’t follow you any further.”

“What about the people outside? Or whatever the hell they are?”

She sighed. “I don’t know,” she said. “This is the first time hearing about them. I’m sorry, I don’t know what to tell you. I can’t help you there.”

I took a deep breath.

“Okay. That’s fine,” I said. “But could you stay on the line with me?”

“Absolutely,” she said. “I’ll be here. Also, one more thing you need to know. About the basement. Don’t-“

She stopped mid-sentence and I looked at my phone. An empty battery sign lingered on the screen for just a moment before it went black. I stared at the screen for a long time. And then I just sat there. If you’ve never experienced sheer dread before, it’s a weird kind of feeling. It nearly takes you out of your own body.

But then I remembered what she’d told me. That eventually this would end. That I still had a chance.

Once again, I looked through the window. The figures were all still there, though they appeared to have moved closer. Or maybe not. I didn’t want to think about it and so I backed away.

*Be patient,* I told myself. *Just wait it out.*

I went back upstairs and got into one of the showers. If I had to wait, then I may as well be comfortable while I did so.

The warm water felt nice, even more so as it was able to wash away the mud that had begun drying on my skin. I saw a bottle of shampoo and reached for it. But I hesitated before squeezing any out. It didn’t feel right. It felt heavy, as if there was something solid inside of it.

I unscrewed the lid and immediately the shower filled up with a deep scent of formaldehyde and rot. I looked inside. The bottle was full of eyeballs. Looks like they had been scooped straight from their sockets. Some of them were blinking.

I put it down and turned off the water and left the shower. I rinsed some of the mud off of my clothes in the sink and then squeezed as much water out of the fabric as I could before putting them back on. It certainly wasn’t comfortable, but with everything else going on, it wasn’t really a big deal.

I didn’t know what else to do so I went back downstairs. It was starting to get dark out, something that just put me more on edge. But I tried to focus on something else. Like the fact that I was starving.

I went into the kitchen and opened up the fridge. There was nothing in there but a small container filled with some dark, sludgy-looking substance. I didn’t open it up. Instead, I tried rifling through the cabinets, eventually finding one that was stocked. With MRE’s. US army rations dated 1968. About a dozen of them.

I didn’t know what to make of it so I just began opening them up, collecting the contents that I thought could’ve been edible. In the end it just amounted a bunch of crackers and hard candies, along with one pack of instant coffee that hadn’t yet solidified. Which was a fine enough meal given the circumstances.

I was checking the window every few minutes and every time the figures seemed to be getting closer. It was hard not to stress about it, but they at least appeared to be moving at a snail’s pace. It’d be a long while before they reached the house.

I paid close attention to the rain as well. At times I’d sit on the couch for hours and just listen to it. But it never slowed down. It only poured harder. As the last daylight drained from the sky, the house was practically underwater. I could see nothing anymore. Water began leaking in from the door and from the ceiling in one of the bedrooms.

I tried watching the television in the living room but could only access one channel. It looked like handheld footage of an attic, the sole source of light being a candle on the floor. Somebody was sitting in front of it, their back turned to the camera. I could tell from the outline of their naked body that they were frail, skin clinging loosely to bone. After a while, they began pounding their fists on the floor and I thought I could hear noise coming from somewhere upstairs. I turned off the television and everything went silent. I didn’t turn it back on.

Soon I could hear a scratching noise. Like fingernails on wood. I traced the source of it to the other side of the wooden door. The basement. I grabbed a knife from the kitchen. Water began leaking in from the bottom. It was murky, as if it were mixed with dirt or blood or both. It smelled horrendous.

I just sat back down on the couch. After a while I got the sense that I was being watched. Through the windows, I could see nothing but my own reflection. Then I turned the lights off and after my eyes had adjusted to the dark, I could make out the outline of somebody looking in. It almost looked like their face was pressed up to the glass.

I tried turning the lights back on, but they were no longer working. It was so dark that I could barely see my own hand in my front of my face. But maybe it was for the best. Because then they wouldn’t be able to see me.

That awful smell from the water leaking in from the basement began to intensify. Like sulfur mixed with metal. With a hint of a rot. I could also smell something burning. A strange heat filled the room.

Soon I could hear the windows creaking. Strain on the glass. As if something were putting gradual, heavy pressure on it from outside. It no longer felt safe in the living room and so I stood up, intending on going back upstairs. Then I realized I could no longer see anything at all. It was quite literally pitch black. I couldn’t even tell where the windows were. Which didn’t make any sense. Because shouldn’t there have been at least a little moonlight?

I began using my hands to feel around, to guide my way towards the stairs. Eventually I found the railing. As I was making my way up the steps, I nearly tripped over something. It was a person, sitting on the steps. Their skin was cold and clammy. Then they began to cry. The crying soon turned into sobbing which turned into wailing. I ran up the rest of the stairs and I heard it chasing after me. It sounded like they crawling on all fours. I felt along the wall until I found one of the bedrooms and then rushed in and shut the door behind me.

Whatever was on the other side began slamming it, each impact rattling the frame. The wailing then turned into a horrific, inhuman shriek.

I was still clutching the knife, though it didn’t provide much comfort. My heart was beating faster than it ever had. Faster than I thought possible. Each slam was more furious than the last and soon I could hear the wood beginning to splinter. The shriek filled the room and it was loud enough to make my head hurt. I scrambled through the darkness until I found the bathroom, shutting myself inside it right as I could hear the bedroom door being ripped off its hinges.

I listened as it stalked its way around the room. Sounded like a dead body being dragged in circles across the carpet. I tried to stay as silent as possible, thinking that maybe it didn’t know I was in here. But then it stopped moving.

And then it knocked on the door.

“Police. Open up,” It said. The voice sounded human enough. I was nearly tempted to listen.

“Open up. Police.”

But I stayed still.

“If you don’t open the door, I’m gonna come in there and rip your stomach out.”

A few more of these threats and then it changed tactics.

“Look what you’ve done,” it said, now in my dad’s voice.

“Fucked everything up. You could’ve had a good life. What have you done?”

I shook my head. “Fuck you,” I muttered under my breath.

“What was that?” It responded. It actually sounded like exactly like him. “Get your ass out here right now! RIGHT FUCKING NOW!”

I’d done a good job of staying composed up until this point, but it was all starting to become too much. You can only experience so much terror before it starts to overload your senses. I guess for some, it ends up paralyzing them. But something else happened to me. The fear turned into disbelief which then turned into rage.

Because what was the point of all this? Was it just to scare me? For what? Why me? What the hell had I done wrong?

I started asking these things aloud. Then I walked up to the door, pressed my head against the wood.

“WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?” I screamed, letting out all my frustrations out at once. “WHAT DO YOU FUCKING WANT?”

They went silent. The knocking stopped as well. But they didn’t leave. I could still hear their raggedy breaths on the other side.

I continued to scream.

“IF YOU WANT TO OPEN UP THE DOOR, GO AHEAD AND FUCKING DO IT! DO IT AND GO FUCK YOURSELF! DO IT AND TEHN GO TO HELL! I DON’T CARE. I DON’T CARE ANYMORE! GET THIS FUCKING BULLSHIT OVER WITH!”

Soon my throat was raw, spit flying all over my lips and chin. I was clenching my jaw hard enough for it to hurt.

“SO YOU’RE JUST GONNA FUCKING STAND THERE? DO SOMETHING! WHAT’S THE FUCKING POINT OF THIS? WHAT’S THE FUCKING POINT? DO SOMETHING OR FUCK OFF AND LET ME LEAVE!”

After this, my memories became scattered. I remember continuing to scream, even as my voice turned hoarse. I remember the rage I felt even though I couldn’t recall exactly what was said.

I remember threatening voices coming from the drain in the sink, water splashing inside the toilet. The shower turning off and on. A burning smell filling up the room.

They were really trying. Doing everything they could. But I think it just pissed me off even more.

At some point, I must’ve fallen asleep. When I woke up, the room was bright. I sat up, seeing sunlight streaming in from the window. And then the pain hit me. My knuckles were bruised, pieces of glass sticking out of them. There was glass, blood and water all over the floor. The mirror had been shattered, as had the shower door. Holes in the walls.

I stood up and looked through the window. No more rain. Just a cloudless blue sky.

I walked over to the door and opened it cautiously, half-expecting to find some monstrosity waiting for me on the other side.

But there was nothing.

I left the bedroom and went down the stairs and into the living room. The door to the basement was open and it was flooded completely by that dark, foul water. I made sure to avoid stepping on any of it as I made my way to the front door.

I opened it up, stepped out into the warm light. Then I started running. The woods seemed to stretch on forever, but I never stopped. Not until I had reached a road. My legs were long past their limits at this point and I just about collapsed the moment my shoes touched the asphalt. I never did hear anything following me but when I looked back into the forest, I could see somebody standing at the tree line.

A young woman in a blue dress. She would’ve been the most beautiful person I’d ever seen had her perfect features not been contorted into visceral, burning hatred.

She continued to scowl at me and I stared back at her. Eventually a car came by and I waved them down. Two large men. They were wary at first and asked to pat me down before they’d let me in. When they found nothing, they offered to drive me back into town.

As we drove away, I looked back at the woods one last time and the woman was no longer there.",4,1753675996.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Hi… not sure if I’m in the wrong here but I feel really awful and just want some outside perspective.

I (20F) have been with Damien (30M) for a little over a year. I know the age gap seems a lot, but he’s been nothing but generous and kind to me. He has his own company, he’s successful, and honestly he changed my life. He let me move in, got me out of a really unstable situation, and even gave me a job with his team. I know I’m lucky.

Last week, he invited me to his team’s client dinner. It was a big deal fancy restaurant, important people, lots of wine and suits. I wore this red dress he helped me pick out a few weeks ago. I felt pretty. Like, really pretty. He told me I looked amazing when we left the house, held my hand in the car, everything felt good.

At the table, I was nervous but trying to be confident. People were laughing and chatting, and I was trying to fit in. At one point, someone asked how we met, and I made a light joke and said, “He basically hired me and then realized I’m cute too.” Everyone laughed, it wasn’t dirty or anything it was just playful.

But he didn’t laugh. He kind of smiled, tight, then got really quiet. The rest of the night he barely looked at me. In the car, he just said, “You don’t know when to keep your mouth shut sometimes.” That hurt. I apologized but chuckled saying it wasn’t that big of a deal but he really didn’t like it and just drove and we had a huge argument the whole ride home I ended up up crying(I’m very emotional and sensitive so yeah)

Ever since, he’s been different. Cold. Polite but distant. At work, it’s strictly professional. At home, he’s quiet. He still pays for things, still buys me coffee, but the warmth is gone. I asked if he’s mad and he said “It’s not a big deal. Just think before you speak next time.”

I feel like I embarrassed him. I didn’t mean to. I honestly thought I was being charming. I’ve never been to events like that before. I’m still figuring this stuff out.

Some friends say he overreacted and I didn’t do anything wrong. Others say I should’ve known better, that I crossed a line in a professional setting.

So… AITA for making a small joke at a work dinner that might’ve embarrassed my boyfriend?

Therefore, I want to have a plan of what I’m eating, to avoid the temptations.

So far, across a planned breakfast and dinner, I’ve logged in 4 items, and only 558 calories, and it’s already at 2,500 mg of sodium.

I don’t super know what to do, because were on vacation so I don’t exactly have a fully stocked fridge, I’m eating what’s made.

Those four items are

\- A few fried egg whites

\- 2 sausage links

\- A salad (olive garden)

\- Chicken and gnocchi soup (also olive garden, and most of the sodium)

  
I know olive garden isn’t the healthiest place on earth, but I have to go, I have no choice. I wouldn’t be as concerned if I hadn’t overeaten today, and didn’t know that someone would be cooking spaghetti in a few days.

I’ve been thinking about switching out the sausage links for a chobani yogurt I bought while I was here, that gets me some more calories and some protein, but gets me down to about 2,100 mg of sodium. Still, only halfway to just 1,000 calories. The only fruit I have on hand is cherries, and I’m probably going to get some coffee, but the only calories there are from sugar.

  
Aside from the cherries, I’ve got cheese cubes, salami bites, turkey bites, and more yogurt. 

What else can I eat without increasing the sodium, (or the fat, ’cause I got too much of that yesterday too)?

 Also, does anyone have any suggestions for olive garden that are a bit healthier? All I’ve ever gotten is that or the kids chicken alfredo, which I can’t order in the restuarant.",1,1753675602.0,loseit,2,0.67,False

I don’t even know how I’m surviving.,"I have no interests, hobbies, pleasures, joys or motivations anymore. I don’t care about literally anything. If you asked me to describe myself as a person, I’d have no way to. I don’t remember what my sense of self feels like - slowly over time it’s faded into nothing.

I used to smell the earth, the trees, the air, the weather. I used to feel the wind, a hug from a friend, my cozy bed. I used to perceive seasons, sunsets, nature and temperature. I used to be in awe of the world and how beautiful it was, excited about my career, motivated to workout and enjoy life. I used to love making a cup of coffee on a chilly morning and sitting by the window watching the sunrise, I used to love summer evenings and the sounds of the circadias. I used to wake up in the mornings with energy and excitement for the day ahead. I used to love going new places and trying new things.

Now I’m just a cold lifeless body who feels and senses nothing. I’m on another planet where time and space don’t exist. I don’t have a self, or a reality. I’m just nothing and nowhere. Even thinking back to 3 years ago when this started and how fearful I was, how the world looked strange and scary, how I couldn’t leave the house for
A year - I don’t even relate to that person, because that person was human and I am not. I had a rich perception of life - of who I was. I liked so many things - and I felt alive. For 3 years now I have suffered and no one can help me - no doctor, no therapist- no medication. I am absolutely destroyed. Unable to enjoy anything, unable to feel anything, unable to sense anything. No memories, no purpose,  no life. I’ll never understand why this happened to me. Why I lost my mother, my brother. Why I have nightmares every night and feel nothing when I awake. I’ll never understand why I was given this, when I’m a good person and always tried to do the right thing. I’ll never understand why me - when there are people in the world who have done horrible things, and don’t have this, even someone in jail has more of a life than I do.

If I could go back in time and warn myself of what was coming, I wouldn’t have taken a single moment for granted. I would have traveled more, loved more, felt more. I’m a creative and that’s my super power - even that has been taken from me. To live in a colorless world when color is your art, it’s like being put in jail. To those who say don’t think about it, you don’t see how I’ve lost my entire soul. It’s been sucked out of my body, there is nothing to else to think about.

For him, i'm having a hard time finding the right word. He was rude, always mad at everything, and i always felt like none of us (me, my sister (now 22F) and my mom) were able of enought or just were enought. Always screaming and cursing at the smallest wrong thing.

My sister is more like him, now screaming and being mad in a second. She wanted to be my mom, like our mother say, having the control on me. And when i didnt agreed, she became violent, pulling my hair, and grabbing me with her nails until I felt on the ground. In my parents back, and i lied to them for her.

In my early teen, i was SA, and it really f\*cked with my mind. When i was at my worst, the noise became a torture, all whistling, loud and sudden noise was hurtfull, my progenitor wasnt helping, screaming and now telling that I was ruining people lives for asking to turn their cellphone noise off. And later treatening my life to make sure i took care of his coffee.

I move out at 17, i needed to go away from all of this, but some experiences and health problems made me came back 3 months later, it's at this moment, at the summer i was 18 that he treatened me. I became distant, the more that i could and started living at my boyfriend's appartment without never really officially moving out.

Now, I'm 20, i'm seeing a psychologist and i'm getting better, and i realised not that long ago, that my sensitity with the noise was caused by my progenitor's incessives screaming and cursing.

I want to share it with my mom, but the thing is, that she will talk to my progenitor, and i'm not ready for this. in two days it's my sister birthday, and for going it's an hour and a half car ride (with my mom and my progenitor) , and i dont want to endure this night without being able to escape, and going with my own car is just still letting the problem stay

# Best Keyboard Covers for Laptops 2025: Protect Your Investment

Laptop keyboards, essential tools for work and leisure, are vulnerable to spills, dust, and the wear and tear of daily use. Keyboard covers offer a simple yet effective solution, providing a protective barrier against these hazards.

With the increasing cost of laptop repairs and replacements,investing in a quality keyboard cover is a smart move for anyone looking to extend the lifespan of their device and maintain its optimal performance.

## Key Features Analysis

Keyboard covers are designed to provide a protective barrier that shields keyboards from various environmental factors and physical damage. Understanding their key features is essential for selecting the right cover for your needs.

**Material Quality and Durability:** Keyboard covers are typically made from either silicone or thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). Silicone covers are known for their versatility and soft touch, conforming closely to the keyboardS contours. They offer good protection against spills and dust. TPU covers, on the other hand, are more rigid and offer superior durability against scratches and abrasion. They typically have a clearer appearance, allowing the keyboard backlighting to shine through more effectively.

**Precision Fit and Keyboard Compatibility:** A well-designed keyboard cover should fit snugly over the keys, without interfering with typing. Precision molding is crucial to ensure each key is accurately covered and that the cover stays in place during use. Compatibility is a pivotal factor. Keyboard layouts can differ slightly between laptop models of even the same brand, so it's imperative to choose a cover specifically designed for your laptop's make and model to guarantee a proper fit.

**Clarity and backlighting:** Many users appreciate being able to see the keyboard's characters, especially in low-light conditions.High-transparency covers allow the keyboard's backlighting to shine through clearly, maintaining visibility. The best keyboard covers utilize materials that minimize glare and distortion, ensuring that the backlighting remains effective and doesn't cause eye strain.

**Tactile Feel and Typing Experience:** A keyboard cover should protect the keyboard without substantially altering the typing experience. ideally,it should provide a pleasant tactile feel and not impede key travel or responsiveness. Some covers feature a textured surface to enhance grip and prevent slippage. Factors like thickness and material density play a critical role in determining the overall feel of the keyboard cover.

**Washability and Maintenance:** Keyboard covers inevitably accumulate dust, dirt, and fingerprints over time. The ability to easily wash and maintain the cover is an important consideration. Silicone and TPU covers are generally easy to clean with mild soap and water. Regular cleaning helps maintain hygiene and prolongs the lifespan of the cover.

**Additional Protective Features:** Some keyboard covers incorporate additional features such as antimicrobial coatings to inhibit the growth of bacteria and germs. Others may feature enhanced edge protection to prevent the collection of debris around the keyboard edges. These supplementary features can offer added value for users concerned about hygiene or keyboard longevity.

## Core Benefits

Laptop keyboard covers offer numerous tangible benefits that extend beyond simple protection. They can notably improve your laptop experience and safeguard your investment.

**Spill Protection:** One of the most notable advantages of a keyboard cover is its ability to prevent liquid spills from damaging the delicate internal components of your laptop. Accidental spills of coffee, juice, or water can cause severe damage, leading to costly repairs or even the need for a replacement laptop. A keyboard cover acts as a waterproof barrier, diverting liquids away from the keyboard and preventing them from seeping into the device.

**Dust and Debris Prevention:** Dust, crumbs, and other small particles can accumulate under the keys of a laptop keyboard, perhaps causing them to stick or malfunction. A keyboard cover effectively seals the keyboard, preventing these particles from entering and interfering with the keys' mechanism. This helps maintain the keyboard's responsiveness and prolongs its lifespan.

**Scratch and Wear Resistance:** Over time, the keys on a laptop keyboard can become worn and faded due to frequent use. Keyboard covers provide a protective layer that shields the keys from scratches,fading,and general wear and tear. This keeps your keyboard looking new for longer and preserves the readability of the key labels.

**Enhanced Hygiene:** Laptop keyboards can harbor bacteria and germs, especially if they are frequently used in public places.Keyboard covers can be easily cleaned and disinfected, helping to maintain a more hygienic typing environment. Some covers even feature antimicrobial coatings for added protection.

**Sound Dampening:** Certain keyboard covers, especially those made from thicker silicone materials, can help dampen the sound of typing, making it less distracting in quiet environments such as libraries or offices. This can be especially beneficial for users who tend to type heavily or who work in shared spaces.

One of them, “Jake” (23M), has been unemployed for a few months now, but recently lined up a job interview that he said was a “big deal” and could help him get back on track.

The night before the interview, he was up until like 4 a.m. gaming and yelling on Discord. I went to bed around midnight. The next morning, I got up at 9 a.m. and saw he was still knocked out on the couch. His interview was at 10.

I made coffee, ate breakfast, and left for class without waking him. He ended up missing the interview and was pissed when he found out I knew the time and didn’t wake him. I told him: “You’re an adult. You knew when it was. I’m not your mom.”

1mb6bs0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mb6bs0,Ice-Gold Refreshment In The Texas Heat!,"In the Texas heat, homemade ice cream can really hit the spot. So we stopped in at [Cold Wave Creations](https://www.coldwavecreations.com) in downtown Bridgeport Texas, where Craig Allen makes and serves some seriously good heat-beating treats.

We sampled the Bailey's-laced offering and a couple others, then settled on a double-dip Salted Caramel and Chocolate combo, and what eventually became a triple-dip serving of Coffee ice cream.

As evidenced by his prominent display of the **We Accept The Goldback** sticker on the door *and* by the cash register, Craig is a sound money enthusiast. While he was scooping our order out of his small-batch containers, we had a good conversation with Craig about the Goldback, and the exciting time we're in as the sound money movement gains traction.

I used the [AuSSISTANT](https://www.aussistant.com) mobile app to calculate the transaction, valuing the Goldbacks at the Daily Exchange Rate. I paid with a 2 Florida Goldback, receiving appropriate change in fiat.

Cold Wave Creations is listed in Goldback's [Pay With Goldbacks](https://www.goldback.com/pay-with-goldbacks/?_map_search=cold+wave+creations) directory, the [Alpine Gold Exchange](https://alpinegold.com/pages/metal-accepting-business-directory) website, and consequently the [AuSSISTANT](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6502538883?pt=127080379&ct=redditPost&mt=8) mobile app as a Goldback-accepting merchant. If you're in Bridgeport - Or heck, anywhere in the North Texas area. It's worth a detour! - be sure to stop by.

We can support local merchants, and strengthen and spread the sound money movement just by spending our Goldbacks the way they're meant to. As the network expands, so does the utility of the Goldback.",4,1753675247.0,Goldback,1,0.83,False

1mb69k3,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mb69k3/rf_a_trip_to_quebec_city/,[RF] A trip to Quebec City,"My train departed Gare centrale de Montreal at approximately 4:30pm Saturday, July 26th, 2025. I was in car 5, seat 12d, with a gorgeous view of the rolling countryside as our VIA train chugged across the North American landscape. People were happy, speaking French and laughing. Couples were sharing pictures and embracing. Me, I sat alone, looking out the window or reading the autobiography of Keith Richards, lead guitarist for the Rolling Stones.

I matched with a woman on Tinder from Laurier-Station, a small town just 50 kilometers southwest of Quebec City. She was a brunette with blue eyes who loved swimming, traveling, and skiing. We had a brief correspondence. She chatted like she knew she was better than me and left me on read.

The train arrived at the Quebec City Train Station. I took my black Adidas backpack and luggage out and made my way up the cobble-stoned street hill towards the hostel where I would be staying. There is a great European feel about the town, with stone buildings, cafes, restaurants, hotels, and shopping. People are generally warm and friendly, but there is a bit of a judgmental attitude towards Americans, especially with the current political climate.

I ordered a non-alcoholic beer at the pub/cafeteria/recreation room in the basement of the hostel where I met a bartender named Maxim. Maxim was a native French-Canadian with blue eyes and shaggy hair. At first, I believe he distrusted me, due to my American accent (more specifically Pittsburghese, which can sound Southern to people not familiar""). As we kept talking, I told him about my interests in comedy, film, and Quebec culture and he opened up. He too was a seeker, which I greatly respected and admired, and I believe over time he noticed I was as well.

It was Saturday night, and the main street of the city was filled with tourists drinking and eating. Enjoying French wine, Italian restaurants, and Irish pubs. The pub I visited had an elaborate basement area with a bar. The piano man was performing 80s hits such as “Don’t Stop Believin’” to the cheers of what looked to be a bachelorette party full of blondes.

I walked out before it got too crazy. In the night the Chateau hotel was illuminated beautifully. The Chateau Frontenac is the iconic symbol of Quebec City, built in 1893, and is said to be the most photographed hotel in the world. It presents itself as a domineering castle from Disney fairy tales.

I woke up the next morning in a cold sweat and went downstairs to the rec room/cafeteria for breakfast. There were scrambled eggs, whole wheat bread, bagels, coffee, orange juice, milk, apples, bananas, and oranges. The room was packed with mostly French-Canadian and European tourists. In many situations, I was the only American on the trip.

There was a 2 1/2 hour tour of Old Quebec City starting at 10am. I joined my fellow travelers. The tour guide was an Irish-Canadian woman in her 50s. She had a lot of passion and enthusiasm for what she was doing. I tipped her 20 American dollars at the end of the tour. I met a German man during the tour who was not a fan of soccer on the walk but knew engineering. There was a cute Asian girl in an unbuttoned blue dress shirt. I decided to make conversation:

“Enjoying the tour?” I asked.

“Yes, there are so many pretty sights” she replied.

“Where are you from?”

“Vancouver, but I moved here from China when I was 13, what about you?”

“Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but I am in New York City now.”

“That’s nice.”

“What’s your name?”

“Chloe.”

“Mine’s Aaron.”

“Nice to meet your Aaron. Solo traveling too I see?”

“How long are you staying here?”

“Until tomorrow morning. I have to catch a flight back to Vancouver.”

“Me too! But on a train to Montreal, then from Montreal to New York.”

“Sounds fun.”

“Yeah, hey let’s get some ice cream, it’s hot!”

And we walked about a block until we found a little ice cream shop. Right when the scooper asked if we were together, Chloe assured her we were separate. I got a chocolate and vanilla twist cone, and she had vanilla dipped in chocolate.

We chatted more outside about our hopes and dreams. She wanted to work in ESG environmental sustenance, and I told her how I wanted to pivot to financial sales back in New York City.

We finished our ice cream cones.

Took a walk back to the hostel, I asked her for her Instagram. It’s pending.

I never saw her again.

Two hours later, in the library area of the hostel, while I was typing out this story, a beautiful, blonde-haired, blue-eyed woman dressed in red appeared across the room and sat down with her Apple headphones in. I was seated in front of an espresso coffee machine. I paid no attention and kept writing.

15 minutes later, I turned my head to the right and noticed she was very close and trying to get a coffee. I began talking to her. She said she was from Italy and worked as a teacher in Vermont for ages 3 to 16. She was visiting Quebec City for the night as she drove her car from Vermont. From our conversation, she was open and personable. She showed me a few tattoos she got recently.

“What’s your name?” I asked.

“I’m Adrienne, but you can call me Adi.”

“I’m Aaron, great to meet you, Adi.”

“I have to go see if my room is ready. How old are you by the way?”

“I’m 30.”

“Ok, I’m 24.”

Adi walked out of the room, and I never saw her again.

I was thinking about how the next time I saw Adi, I would pitch spending $650 to ditch the hostel and stay at the world-famous Chateau Frontenac for the night. But it never happened. Fortune favors the bold.",1,1753675058.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

So I’ve been dating a guy and overall things have been going pretty well between us. We’ve had some good times, and he’s generally kind and fun to be around.

But there’s one thing that’s been sitting a bit wrong with me, and I’m not sure how to handle it without sounding petty.

One night, when we were out together, he said he didn’t have money on his card and asked me to transfer him $200 so he could pay in cash. I initially offered to just pay for everything myself (I really didn’t mind), but he insisted on me sending him the money and said he’d cover it with cash. So I did.

It’s been a few days since, and he hasn’t mentioned paying me back at all. We went out again recently — just casual stuff, like grabbing some food and coffee — and he paid for those without issue, which I appreciated. But that $200 is still hanging in the air.

I’m not even sure if he sees that night as something I covered for him or something he intends to repay. I don’t want to bring it up in a way that sounds transactional, but I also don’t want to be in a dynamic where I’m expected to quietly pick up the bill without clarity.

I’m not someone who minds treating a guy I like sometimes — but it’s important for me to feel that generosity is mutual, not assumed. I don’t want my money being treated casually just because I’m easygoing.

How should I bring it up without sounding weird? Or am I already overthinking it?

Only had to do a few minor repairs, but nothing unexpected for an espresso machine.

The La Cara I've owned since January and it has been a really fun machine to use and has unbelievable steam pressure. I use it when I have really early morning meetings and I don't want to risk waking the family.

I picked up the Macap tamper from a coffee shop that was closing during the pandemic for cheap and me (and my toddler) enjoy using it for consistent tamping.

Mahlonig x64sd - I love the look and it has been producing some great grounded coffee. My only complaints so far are that I really wish it didn't need the bellows as they sort of advertised, but it is wicked fast and quiet and I get exactly out exactly what I put it every time, and that using the bellows sprays a bit of coffee fines even past the catch cup extension.

I'm currently working on a 3d printed version of a QuinSpin, just need some time to finish the wiring. That will replace my knock box hopefully.

And on the topic of 3d printed, I also use a 3d printed portafilter holder and a umikot. Both have really been great additions along with a 3d printed lever attachment to the terrible steam knob on the Lelit.

The cabinet is a Wayfair POS (see tilting middle door), so that will need replacing soon, but inside is a red Faema Ciao that I restored along with a LaCimbali Microcimbali Liberty (in brass) that I also restored and constantly dealing with the corrosion of the boiler. Final one is a Pasquini Livietta (aka Olympia Maximatic) from the 80s that I got for free because the previous owner thought it didn't work, but he didn't realize you have to add water directly into the boiler in addition to the water reservoir.

I previously had a Nuova Simonelli Elli-matic that I got for $25 but gave that to my neighbor how got me into 3d printing.

1mb63ds,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mb63ds,[Knoebels] trip report,"I was at Knoebels yesterday for the annual “ACE flies with the Phoenix” event. The event started a couple of hours before the park opened, and began with a water cup challenge to see who could hold a full plastic cup of water while riding the StratosFear tower while spilling as little as possible. As you might imagine, some people really got soaked! Then it was on to ERT on the Haunted Mansion and Black Diamond. There were some other ACE events later in the afternoon but for the most part I made good use of my time to ride and get something to eat and drink. First up I rode the flume ride, and on this one you do get a little bit wetter than on some others I've ridden. Having the shorter first drop hidden from view is a nice touch. However, if you might get even wetter if there are people there at the end to spray water on you.

This was a nice cooling ride, as even though the sun wasn't out, it was still quite warm and muggy. Then I was onto Twister, and got a ride on it. I had almost forgotten how intense and whippy this coaster is, and I decided that I'd go for one more ride on it later that evening. I would save Phoenix for the night ERT, especially since the park didn't offer wrist bands that day.

Then I came to a ride that I had long avoided, the same one that certain ACE members were competing against each other on that morning. I have this thing about drop towers that has kept me from riding them. First, if the lines are long, I often pass because I see them as “one trick ponies”. But my real issue is the abrupt and sudden “heart coming up into the throat” feeling that I've had a hard time with. I have always enjoyed coaster drops and negative Gs, but I could never get past that feeling of something (that I'm on) instantly dropping out from under me. My first excuse to not ride didn't hold up, as the StratosFear tower only had a one cycle wait, if that. I stood there for several minutes, thinking about riding it. What if I did have that horrible feeling? And also, this sort of drop tower has a reputation as being one of the “worst” out there, not by height but by creating that feeling that has always freaked me out. Finally, I decided that this was it. I was going to do it anyway. I was tired of having this reluctance. So I got in line, and selected a seat that faced the right side of the operator booth. That way there would be fewer people to see me looking like I was going to have a heart attack. I was kind of nervous, but then I told myself that if I had that bad reaction I'd not ever ride another drop tower. I also told myself that I really want to like drop towers, and to also get over my problem that has stopped me from riding them. On the way up I looked out over that side of the park, and tried to enjoy the view, knowing that very soon I'd be heading rapidly back towards the ground. Suddenly and without warning it happened, and down we went. I've only ever ridden two drop towers (the one at SFA and the Liberty Launch at Holiday World) and the StratosFear tower really does slam you down fast and hard. I see why it has such a reputation! That said, I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't freak out, and I didn't feel like my heart had been jammed up into my throat. My hands shook a little for a moment or two after getting off, but that was it. I feel like I've finally made peace with and possibly even found some enjoyment in riding drop towers.

Then, after this momentous turn of events, I stopped to get something to eat and drink. At this time my husband joined me in the park, and he got something to eat and we walked around a bit. As he was not interested in the coasters (nor was he part of the ACE event) he decided to head back to the hotel. We stayed at the nearby Knights Inn and I wouldn't recommend it as it is old, worn and dated and there was a roach that came out from under the coffee machine in the lobby. On the way out, we stopped near the StratosFear tower so he could take a rest. While sitting there, he explained to me how it works. Having a husband who worked as a mechanic on industrial machinery can be rather interesting at times while walking thru parks... On the way out I managed to get him on one ride – the skyride, which of course is quite mellow. And during the ride, he was eyeing the mechanical parts.

Later that evening I got another ride on Twister, and also got one on Impulse. This was about the longest line I waited in all day, about a half hour. It is low capacity and is right at the front of the park, but does have some enjoyable moments and only has lap bar restraints. I passed on Flying Turns this time around, as it had a line just as long as Impulse. That evening I also rode the Flyer, which is perhaps the only permanent ride at an amusement park that runs on a diesel or gas powered engine. This just lends to the quirkiness that is Knoebels. It was getting late, and I still had a few tickets left. Just enough to ride Downdraft, which was on the way to the Phoenix. As I got on, I looked over and wondered why it had this seemingly out-sized hydraulic motor. It wouldn't take me long to find out, as the ride began. I swear I don't think I've ever felt sustained centrifugal forces that strong on a ride...I could literally feel the skin on my face being pulled to my right. I was totally getting vertigo and once I got off, for a moment or two I was walking around like a drunk! I don't think I'd ever ride it again, but if such potent forces are your thing, that's where it's at.

Finally it was nearing time for our ERT, and I headed over to the main feature of the night for ACE. It didn't take too long for the GP to clear out of the line at the Phoenix, and during the ERT session I got seven laps, three towards the front and three towards the back, and the last one in the back. I don't think there are any “bad” seats on this coaster, as the multiple pops of airtime are there no matter where you sit. Those last rides wrapped up another great day at Knoebels. I think the more I visit this park, the more I like it. What it lacks in cutting edge record breaking coasters and rides is made up for by its laid back, old time feel, and of course free parking, free admission and good food.

1mb60gr,https://www.reddit.com/r/petfoodfacts/comments/1mb60gr/common_human_foods_that_are_harmful_to_dogs/,Common Human Foods That Are Harmful to Dogs,"As loving pet parents, we often feel tempted to share our favorite snacks and meals with our furry companions. However, many human foods that are perfectly safe for us can be dangerous—or even deadly—for dogs. Understanding which foods to avoid is vital to keeping your canine friend healthy and safe.

# 1. Chocolate

Chocolate contains theobromine and caffeine, both of which are toxic to dogs. Dark chocolate and baking chocolate are especially dangerous. Even small amounts can cause vomiting, diarrhea, rapid breathing, and seizures.

# 2. Grapes and Raisins

These fruits may seem harmless but can cause sudden kidney failure in dogs. Even a small quantity can be toxic and lead to lethargy, vomiting, and dehydration.

# 3. Onions and Garlic

Whether raw, cooked, powdered, or dried, onions and garlic can damage a dog’s red blood cells, leading to anemia. Symptoms might include weakness, pale gums, and an elevated heart rate.

# 4. Avocado

Avocados contain persin, which can cause vomiting and diarrhea in dogs. While some dogs may tolerate small amounts, it's best to avoid this food altogether to prevent digestive upset.

# 5. Alcohol

Alcohol has the same effect on a dog's liver and brain as it does on humans, but it takes far less to do serious damage. Even a small amount can cause vomiting, difficulty breathing, and in severe cases, coma or death.

# 6. Xylitol (Artificial Sweetener)

Found in sugar-free gum, candy, baked goods, and even some peanut butters, xylitol can lead to a dangerous drop in blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia) and liver failure. Symptoms include vomiting, coordination issues, and seizures.

# 7. Macadamia Nuts

Macadamia nuts can cause weakness, vomiting, tremors, and hyperthermia in dogs. The effects can appear within 12 hours of ingestion and last up to two days.

# 8. Caffeinated Beverages

Tea, coffee, energy drinks, and soda contain caffeine, which is highly toxic to dogs. It can lead to restlessness, rapid breathing, heart palpitations, and muscle tremors.

# 9. Cooked Bones

While raw bones may be safe in moderation, **cooked bones** can splinter easily and pose a choking hazard or cause serious internal injuries and blockages.

# 10. Dairy Products

Many dogs are lactose intolerant, and consuming milk, cheese, or ice cream can lead to digestive problems such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea.

# Tips for Keeping Your Dog Safe

* Always check ingredients before giving your dog any table scraps or treats.
* Educate family members and guests about foods that are harmful to pets.
* Keep trash cans secured and food stored out of reach.

When in doubt, consult your veterinarian before feeding your dog anything outside of their normal diet. Prevention is the best protection when it comes to your pet’s health.",1,1753674244.0,petfoodfacts,1,1.0,False
1mb6001,https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/1mb6001/duggar_digest_4/,Duggar Digest #4,"Tomorrow, the Duggars favorite haunt, Burn Boot Camp, is kicking off a Taylor Swift themed “Eras” week. So I thought I would use that as a springboard for this week’s Duggar Digest!

JIM BOB: IN HIS ✨JERIATRIC✨ ERA

Almost the entire Duggar family gathered for a surprise 60th birthday for the OG Patriarch. Present company included Jana/Steven, Jill/D’wreck/kids, Bin/Jessa/Preachers/Plants, Joe/Kindra/Kids, Josiah/Lauren/Alphabet-Brigade, Joystin Clan, Jed/Kathy/kids, Jer/Hannah/Kids, Jase/Maddie, James/MysteryGirl, Justin/Claire, and all the lost kids. J’Tyler, Laura dMaise, and the Kaneshiros showed up as a bonus. Jim Bob seemed Jinuinely surprised, and Michelle’s suntan support hose made an appearance (under her leggings…which were under her skirt). 

The family had a cookout and mostly hung out on the lake pulling inner tubes and floaties behind the boat, and diving off the boat. Jed brought along a camper with AC for the moms and a fridge for all the food.

Gunner got his thumb stuck in the camper down and it got popped out of joint. Joe and Austin made a splint out of duct tape and napkins, Jana took the other Joystin kids, and Joy and Austin left the party early to take Gunner for an Xray. Nothing was broken, but he wore a cast/splint for a few days to keep everything in place while it healed. 

JANA: IN HER ✨BLISSFUL WISSMAN✨ ERA 

Jana’s social media posts have not stopped over the last few weeks. When she’s not trying to overtake Joy’s role as the top influencer of the family, she’s posting a steady stream of shots of her and Steven with captions like “My favorite place to be is with you!” (This week, that place was Oshkosh WI for the EAA AirVenture, along with Jer & Hannah, much to the chagrin of all our midwestern snarkers.)

JILL: STILL IN HER ✨HIPPIE GARDENER✨ ERA

Most of Jill’s social media posts this week were about her garden, including a “happy mail” package of seeds from Gardenary. Astute observers noticed what looked like a tattoo on her hand and wrist. After a close examination of a bunch of story screenshots, I’m pretty confident that it’s just Scripture in Sharpie. The hippie braid extensions are still hanging on for dear life. 

JESSA: IN HER ✨WAITING ON YET ANOTHER BABY✨ERA

Jessa has been radio silent since the 18th. It’s safe to assume she’s probably had her next Preacher/Plant by now, or is still waiting on baby. (I’m guessing it’s the former.)

THE VUOLOS: IN THEIR ✨PROFESSIONAL PODCASTERS✨ERA

Most of the Vuolo’s content these days revolves around their podcast. The clickbait thumbnails are nauseating. Bold text titles like “SHOWERS IN THE POOL?!” and “I CAN’T DENY WHAT’S HAPPENING!” make the podcast episodes seem much more salacious than they actually are. 

Jer & Jinger gushed over the Vuolos…who “make it such a point to come all the way across the country to visit and be present”…every 2-3 months. Jer & Jinger will actually host his parents for like…ten days. Doing the math, that’s…well…a lot of time they are spending with parents who are…not the Duggars. Maybe that means nothing, or maybe when Jer said, “You guys are the best grandparents,” it was a not-so-subtle dig at Lolli and Pops. 

On the podcast with Jeremy’s parents, they talked a lot about Jer’s mom’s organization, SWAN, which helps children of parents who are incarcerated through music and mental health counseling. The poor M kiddos were not mentioned, so I guess they can’t help everyone! 🤷🏻‍♀️

They also flew Lydia Plath and her new husband out to LA for the express purpose of being on their podcast. After over an hour of talking, they had only gotten through Zach and Lydia’s upbringings, meeting, and early dating days - so they decided they would need a part 2 podcast episode. 🙄 

JOY: IN HER ✨DANCING QUEEN ✨ ERA

When she isn’t posting links for…literally everything (sunscreen, makeup, furniture, clothes, kids products) or exploiting her kids (eating, visiting the dentist, swimming, playing, practicing their “evil laughs,” etc)….Joy is in her living room with her kids, singing worship music, and having a completely impromptu, not at all contrived dance party that just happened to happen while her phone was recording. 

KENDRA: IN HER ✨SHORTS-WEARING ✨ ERA

It finally happened!! The last domino has fallen. Kindra, the only Duggar woman NOT under JB’s headship who has clung to modesty standards with an iron grip, has finally succumbed to sister-in-love peer pressure. Kindra was seen at Burn Boot Camp…in shorts. (Oh how the mighty have fallen!)

JED & KATEY: IN THEIR ✨BUSY SEASON ✨ERA

Jed & Katey took a road trip with their kids this week, and Katey did an IG-AMA to pass the time. She said that she and OGJed are in a “busy season,” but Burn Boot Camp is only 7 minutes from their house. They go first thing in the morning 3 days a week, where they get 45 minutes of childcare and get to workout “together.” (OGJed isn’t spotted nearly as often in the BBC stories, but he was there once this week before they left town.) 

When she gets stressed by mom life of four-under-four, she handles it by talking it out with her mom, Jed, or her sisters…or meeting her physical needs (she’s usually tired or hungry or both). No mention of Dearest Mother-in-Love Michelle. I’m sure she’s waiting in the wings for the looming Laundry Room Breakdown that’s still a couple of kids out. 

On advice she would give her younger self, Katey wishes she had spent more time in her Bible when she was a teenager because “busy seasons with little ones” limit how much she can have her “quiet time.” (At least she knows how to spell “quiet” correctly.) She’s still up multiple times a night (even though the twins are now on formula) so waking up early before the kids “is not feasible.” 

She didn’t grow up in a strict household but rather was raised on Disney Channel and Kid Cuisine. She’s looking forward to putting their kids in ballet and tee ball someday. Regarding the Duggars - they truly do love pickles, but she claims that everything else you read online is false. 🙄

MADDIE: IN HER (AMATEUR) ✨INFLUENCER ✨ ERA

Maddie really took off running on her INSTA this week, but is still trailing far behind the rest of pack. She did an IG-AMA while she got her nails done (an idea she totally did NOT get from Katey). She revealed that she’s finishing up her last year of college (online) toward a teaching degree. She soft launched her influencing game by sharing a few products for her “treasure box” that she always has on hand when she’s working in Sunday school, babysitting, or tutoring. She promises more teaching related posts to come. Until then, you can find her promoting Bible study books and 7 Brew Coffee.

JACKSON: IN HIS ✨MY SISTERS ARE MY BESTIES ✨ERA

Jackson posted on Instagram for the first time in a few months. All of the pictures are of him and his sisters. It appears that Jackson and J’Hannie’s relationship has transcended their talking heads stage, as she is in most of the pictures. J’Hannie is basically Mini Jana. Josie looks like Michelle or Joy, depending on the angle. From the few photos posted, it seems Jackson also has a sweet spot for Jordyn. Jennifer continues to be the lostest of the lost girls, only making it into one slide out of the nine. (Jackson also gave us proof of life for Claritin.)

FAMY: IN HER ✨I PROMISE I’M ACTUALLY STILL FAMOUS ✨ ERA

Shiny Happy People season 2 dropped this week, and FAMY want everyone to know that SHE IS IN IT. She says S2 is going to “Blow. Your. Mind. I’m not even kidding.” I haven’t been #blessed enough to watch it (yet), but from those who have…it seems that the producers basically used FAMY and her husband as a segue from S1 to S2…a passing glance as it were. That didn’t stop her from doing a GRWM before her Zoom interview with E! News. (Did you know she is on TV, y’all?)

She also did some very Unholy Disrupting of everyone’s Instagram feed this week by flaunting her fluff in the name of encouraging moms. She tells moms that their self worth isn’t measured by “how perky anything is anymore” …in text splattered right across her bikini-clad cleavage.

JOSH: STILL IN HIS ✨PRISON✨ ERA. 

May this era last forever.  

TATER TOTS: THIS AND THAT FROM THE DUGGARVERSE

Gospel Lite Baptist Church has VBS this past week, but haven’t posted any pictures yet. Joy said her kids were going. Only Jordyn sang in the choir this week. 

A blurry Felicity Vuolo turned 7 this week, and the Vuolos took some kind of ministry trip to Illinois. Jer posted string of photos with the caption “the S is silent.” He really thinks he’s so clever, doesn’t he! 

Amy posted a sponsored post for a “click & clean & organize” system which she said is “amazing,” yet everything was still in its packaging, so I’m not sure she’s even used the stuff. 

Desiree Pecan turned one this week, celebrated with a crown, balloons, a smash cake, and a social media posts. That means it’s about time for the next future Patriarch or Doormat to be conceived soon. Currently Anna & Priscilla are neck and neck on the kiddo count, but at least Priscilla has a husband (who isn’t in prison and can actually knock her up)! Somewhere, Anna is biting her nails. 

Happy Sunday and Happy Snarking!

Hey all! Sharing my journey in hopes it motivates even one person who feels stuck the way I did just a couple of years ago.

**Starting Out:**  
November 2022: I was 96kg, scared for my health and wanting to avoid a future of diabetes or heart meds. So I started walking—consistently, but the scale didn’t budge for four months. Those early days were rough: shin splints, aching feet, and some walks where even a single step felt impossible. But I kept showing up.

**Food Overhaul:**  
I completely ditched my old habits—no more weekly biryanis (3+ a week before), shawarmas, or oversized rice portions. Haven’t had a whole biryani or shawarma since Nov 2022.  
Now, my food is simple:  
-  Morning: Green tea, a banana, coffee (no sugar)  
-  Lunch: very Small portion of rice(like a spoon or two), lots of veggies, chicken or fish  
-  Dinner: Ragi or wheat dosa, tea without sugar  and an egg.
-  Every day: a LOT of whole milk curd/yogurt (my main food—so filling and great for digestion).

**Walking & Running Milestones:**  
- Dec 2022: Walked 620km  
- Jan 2023: 854km  
- Feb 2023: 712km  
Still, my weight didn’t drop until March 2023—so if progress is slow, *don’t quit*.  
Running started tiny: Jan 2023 I could just barely do 300m nonstop. By April, 10 rounds (~3km); July, my first nonstop 5K; Oct, an hour straight; July 2024, a full 10K; Oct 2024, PB 10K in 56min.  
Now, I run 10K four times a week (40km weekly) and it feels normal.

**Milestones & Mindset:**  
- Sub-75kg by June 2023  
- 70kg by Nov 2023 (and maintaining)
- Huge improvements in stamina, energy, and health
- Up every day at 5am, bed at 9:30pm (this routine for 2 years straight!)
- Friends/family supportive—though family worries I eat too little sometimes (I’m fine: lots of protein, good carbs, and always curd!)

Biggest change:  
I used to *live for eating*. Now I *eat for living.* Food fuels life, but it isn’t my main event anymore.

**What I Learned (for Others Stuck at the Start):**  
-  Go slow and steady (seriously—I lost nothing for 3–4 months and still made it!)  
-  Invest in great running shoes (don’t go cheap if you’re walking/running a lot)  
-  Sleep is as crucial as exercise  
-  Consistency and routine matter more than motivation  
-  progress gets easier when eating well and being active stop feeling like punishment

If you’re starting your own journey: trust me, you can surprise yourself. I never thought I’d be running 10k, four times a week. Now, it’s just who I am. Every walk, every healthy meal, and every night of quality sleep—they add up, even if you can’t see it at first.

*Don’t give up. What feels impossible today will be your warmup tomorrow. 💪*

I’ve recently made this recipe for oat cakes that I can make for breakfast or as a guilt-free dessert, but I’ve just noticed something strange: the chocolate ones are slightly tougher, they rise unevenly, and they sink slightly after cooling!! Is this because of the added acidity from the dutched cocoa and instant coffee powder? Do I need to reduce the amount of baking powder used for the chocolate ones?? Do I need to add more milk for the chocolate variety??? The recipe’s as follows:

Dry ingredients:
50g oats, blended until fine
1 scoop (31g) vanilla ice cream protein powder
1 tbsp monkfruit
1 tsp chia seeds
3/4th tsp clabber girl baking powder
Pinch of salt

Wet ingredients:
1/4th cup fage total 0% Greek yogurt
150ml fairlife fat free milk

(for vanilla cakes)
1 tsp vanilla extract

(for chocolate cakes)
2 tbsp Hershey’s special dark cocoa
1 tsp instant coffee powder

Combine all dry ingredients EXCEPT for baking powder. Heat milk until it begins to scald, then pour into dry mixture and whisk to combine. If making chocolate cakes, stir instant coffee into the hot milk ensure it dissolves fully prior to combining. If making vanilla cakes, add vanilla extract to the batter. Mix in Greek yogurt and allow the batter to sit in the fridge for about an hour for the hot milk to fully hydrate the oats and chia/thicken the batter. Right before baking, stir in baking powder then split batter into two 14 oz buttered ramekins and bake at 300 for 40 minutes.",1,1753673933.0,Baking,4,1.0,False

I bounce between Rocklin, Folsom and Sacramento (city college area) I’ve been working on quitting my vices one at a time to improve my mental and physical health and while I have no qualms about hanging with people that aren’t sober or enjoy social media I would just like to find something that doesn’t rely on those things.

I’ve enlisted some existing friends and they just aren’t consistent (no shade, just how things have been going) and I’d love to expand my circle to more folks that are taking steps to be kind to their future selves. I quit drinking, smoking, nicotine, and cut back on coffee and social media nearly completely so I just don’t tend to participate in the same social activities that I used to and many of my friends just aren’t there yet.

I’ve bleached over pure henna plenty of times without issue and used henna over bleached hair without issue.

Hey there, I haven’t seen anything on this so I thought I’d drop it here.
I’ve been using henna and indigo on my hair for about 13 years starting with Lush’s henna before they reformulated which pushed me into the world of mixing my own concoctions which I like much better and are a lot less messy. 
That being said, I recently tried indigo after my henna when usually I process my henna for 4 hours and then process my indigo for 20 minutes both for good dye release as per their packaging instructions (both are pure henna and pure indigo, no add ins) and then mix them together before application. My hair got much darker than I anticipated. Initially I used oil to lift as much of the indigo as I could and used a clarifying shampoo and did this for around 2 weeks. After a certain point the water did nothing but run clear. 

This is where color remover comes in. I’ve had success with color oops in the past over henna but it pulls only a little out compared to the Matrix one. I used distilled water instead of the 20 vol developer. It still smelled like straight bleach and looked like really runny bleach. When on the head it smells like an over chlorinated pool. It did lighten well. I left it on for 15 minutes the first time because I ended up with some on my scalp (it’s for off scalp application) and it began to get very warm so I washed it out. It felt gritty and gross so I used conditioner to get it out and it worked well. I ended up with bleached roots in one spot but other wise the color of my hair had lifted. I did a second round the same day and I’m giving my hair a break for a day or two before round 3. With the amount of indigo I had in I was fully expecting my hair to go bright green like it had when I had bleached it in the past (8 years ago) given this stuff smelled so much like bleach. I have no green tint to my hair and the color remover washed out bright almost neon blue the first round which shocked me and a little less bright blue the second time. My hair still feels healthy and soft, there wasn’t any dye of chemicals (including removers) used on my hair previous to this so it was just layers of henna and indigo on undamaged hair. 

Here’s my typical henna mix:

45% henna powder (let dye release for 2-4 hours)
35% cassia powder (added directly to henna)
20% indigo (let dye release for 20 mins)

I also add a small spoon full of these:
- Amla powder
- Aloe powder
- Fenugreek powder
- Amla oil
- Melted raw cocoa butter

Liquid:

- Warm water (usually)
- Hibiscus tea (if I want more of a red tinge)
- Instant coffee or freshly brewed strong coffee (if I’m going for a more brown tinge)


I mix everything into the henna in a big bowl and then use gloves to apply it to my head and wrap it with cling wrap and then a towel to keep it warm. I leave it on for 2-3 hours typically and I’m happy with the results. I rinse it out completely and shampoo on day 4 after full oxidation.

For the coffee ice cream, I made a standard base and used coffee concentrate for the flavor. Came out great, zero complaints. Also used half & half for this one and it had such a smooth consistency.

1mb5pil,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mb5pil/my_mother_is_going_through_the_change_and_pushing/,My Mother is going through the change and pushing me away. How did you handle?,"I’m in my early 30s and my mom is 55 and going through menopause for almost 3 years. She makes everything about her and she’s making me feel like I’m a bad daughter. I don’t know what to do. 

It only seems to be getting worse as time passes and I’m desperate. 

Context (long):
I am an only child and we are very close but spending time together is very difficult now. 
I moved out years ago for school and stayed living in a big city in a completely different state and part of the country than my parents. I miss them and do try to visit multiple times a year or have them visit (I pay) and we talk on the phone every day- kind of a cultural thing too, we’re close. 
Ever since my mom started menopause, she’s become very emotional about everything. She gets very upset, butthurt and then cries but never admits fault or apologizes and it takes her a while to snap out of it. While I was planning my wedding, she constantly was upset I wasn’t getting married where they live and during my wedding day, she acted extremely selfish: she wanted my bridesmaids to basically lay down a red carpet for her and everyone to acknowledge as the mother of the bride and for everyone to want to talk to her… she said my bridesmaids didn’t really talk to her so she left -she left the getting ready suite after the stylists got her makeup and hair done- she was not there for me and kept getting irrationally upset if people were not focused on her or if I wasn’t answering her every wish. She left the suite upset and almost made me cry. She wouldn’t tell me why either. 

They came to visit months later and she kept making it like she didn’t want to bother us at our home… one day they asked for the heat to be turned on because they were cold and I said let’s see how it goes tonight because the house temperature is 72… well, the next morning she said they were going to pack up and go back home because they couldn’t sleep and they didn’t want to disturb me. I had to beg them to stay and I changed the temperature. 

Now I went to visit them recently and my mother wanted to join me in every activity which I let her, but then still got upset I went for coffee with a friend once while visiting and because I had to work one night and we ate dinner at home instead of out. She wouldn’t let it go. She kept throwing it in my face. I told her me and my husband were going on vacation in a month and she and my dad didn’t ask much about it and she honestly seemed upset. She has asked for us to go on a vacation before and it hasn’t come to fruition, because I don’t get much vacation and I just got married. 
She comes off like: you don’t want to spend time with us (even if I’m with her at her home) because I’m working for half the day; you don’t want to travel with us (I’d have to pay for her and my dad even if partial that would be the expectation so it hasn’t been possible); and you make a lot of money but can’t do XYZ things I want… like she tells me I need to buy a car, or this and that furniture… and while me and my husband are very well off, we are very cautious about saving as we want to start a family and I don’t want to work my very awfully demanding job forever…. 

Sometimes she will even be annoyed if I don’t call her and she’s very short with me when I do after the fact. 

My mom blames her menopause for her emotional and rage moments. But I’m more concerned she seems to not like me, or gets upset and won’t tell me why. She feels I don’t care about her or love her (she constantly asks) and I feel guilty and like a bad daughter… but she never apologizes. My dad is constantly on her side because if he agrees with me she says we are siding against her and we hate her and she get so moody upset. 

I don’t know what to do. I think this is normal menopause behavior, but from your experience is it going to get worse? And does she hate me or resent me or thinks I’m failing her? How can I handle this so we can still be close? 
Thank you!

Not an easy job, didn't help being third shift but hey it was good money for the time. Anyway at one point there was this guy there. He was a kind guy, solid worker too. 

I remember once he nervously and aqwardly gave me a complement.

Him: ""You smell nice""
Me: ""Oh... Um... Thank you""

And that was it. Fast forward a bit the other coworkers said he was a Gay guy, and some gave him grief for it. He ended up quitting later on, don't know if it was because of that or something else, but he left.

I don't know if this is normal, but as time has moved on. And I'm discovering more about myself, I still sometimes think back to that guy. ""Dang, he was really sweet. I wish I could have got him a coffee."" 

To be honest... I think I'm telling this story because I'm coming to terms that I'm gay. (Or at the VERY least, not strictly straight.) And I'm just trying to get used to that reality. 

Will I ever pursue that reality, and find another man who I can love, cherish, and Marry. Knowing my people pleasing personality, probably not if I'm honest with myself. I'll probably remain single to be frank. 

 I love my family dearly, and they would be devastated and excommunicate me if they ever thought I was gay. That would devastate me as well. Doesn't help that where I live gay men are unicorns, they are just really rare. 

A part of me feels disgusted for even entertaining these feelings. ""I shouldn't feel this way, this is wrong, your shameful for feeling this way.""

But hey, I can at least think back to that cute guy who complemented me. And imagine buying him a coffee.

Still, that -4.5 spread feels like the line was drawn by a fan who’s seen Calgary’s offense stall more times than they’d admit.

**Ottawa**, at **+4.5 spreads (1.95)** and a **moneyline of +2.8 (implied 35.7% win probability)**, are the classic ""sleeping giant"" — or maybe just a giant who’s really good at napping. Their +4.5 line gives them a fighting chance, though their 35.7% implied odds suggest the books aren’t betting on a miracle.

As a requirement, I also completed the pre-learner licence course as well as the DKT.

This intersection always confused me, so I asked two different instructors, as well as some of my coworkers, to clarify. In my test, the exact scenario happened.

I’m the blue car. According to the lessons I took, when I’m behind the stop line on a split road, I should treat it like a normal intersection and give way to the yellow car. So I did. Then the assessor said, “You have right of way.” I asked him, “Shouldn’t I give way to him since he’s going straight?” He said, “That’s a roundabout,” and in my head I thought, “No, that’s not a roundabout. It has stop signs and all.” But he kept insisting. I just didn’t comment further because I was so anxious he was going to fail me. After that intersection, he closed his ipad and kept quiet the whole time. In the end, he said he was going to be lenient and gave me a passing mark.

The last few weeks have been brutal deadlines, pressure, stress. I’m behind in almost everything. My history essays are sprawling and aimless. My artwork looks lazy and uninspired. I’ve been putting in hours but getting nowhere.

And I haven’t been sleeping.

Not because of nightmares. Just… time. There’s never enough of it. I know that sounds like a cliché “I’m a student, I don’t sleep” but it’s true. My schedule’s a mess. I’ll spend an hour trying to start a painting, then spiral into panic because I haven’t done the reading for a lecture I forgot I even had. But this week, somehow, I managed to submit everything.

Not well. Not proudly. But done. For the first time in ages, I could finally breathe. No more all-nighters. No more caffeine-fueled essay sessions or crying over unblended acrylics at 3AM. So I slept.

And then I dreamt something… wrong.

It wasn’t just unsettling. It meant something. It felt like a message. Or a warning.

I was in a wheat feild. It was overgrown and dry, flowing one with the wind. The clouds hung high above me pale, loose, not threatening rain. The strangest thing was the sun: it was both rising and setting at once, dancing between golden and pink light like the sky couldn't make up its mind.

There was nothing on the horizon. Not a tree. Not a distant barn or faraway city tower. Just wheat. Endless painted waves of dry gold rolling over hills and hills of fertile land. And I,  I was the first thing to ever touch it.

The stalks brushed against my legs. They felt sharp at first. But over time, they softened. I left a long trail behind me as I wandered, the pods hissing gently with every step.

I walked for what felt like hours. The only sound was a shallow melody from a type of bug crickets, maybe. Or something else that sings.

Then I saw it.

A blur. Dark. Human-shaped. Far in the distance.

I ran to it like a moth chasing fire. I don’t know why. Something about it pulled me in. But then I tripped and when I got back up. it was gone. I called out. Nothing answered, just a breeze passing through the place where he had stood. Still, I walked on. I crested the hill where the figure had been, and that’s when the land shifted.

The wheat was gone. All of it. In its place, a cold, barren field. Dead grass and pale dirt. The only thing in sight now was a building a castle. The young golden pink sky now grown, red and dark blue 

It rose in front of me like a monument to madness. Its towers leaned on one another. Its bridges led to nothing. The structure looked ancient, impossible. It wanted to be seen. It was now called to me.

I turned back, just once, and saw that the trail I had left in the wheat was gone. The land had healed. The stalks stood tall again, like I’d never touched them. Like I was never there

I went toward the castle.

The doors were impossibly tall. They didn’t budge at first. I pushed with all my strength, and eventually, they gave just enough for me to slip through.

The inside was dark and choking with dust. Fire lit the walls. Sunlight bled through stained glass the color of rich gold. The air tasted old.

A hallway stretched out before me, lined with huge paintings, each one covered by a sheet. One was only half-covered I looked beneath the cloth.

A knight. Full silver armor. Every inch of it carved with strange, violent incantations runes that looked hammered in, not engraved. Old, evil symbols I didn’t recognize. I couldn’t tell if the armor was meant to repel or welcome darkness.

I didn’t dare lift the cloth to see who or what wore it. At the end of the hall was another set of doors. These opened easier.

Inside: a vast, candlelit dining room. The ceiling stretched upward forever. A chandelier dangled over a table that could seat eighty. Forty chairs on each side. Portraits hung from every wall kings, queens, kingdoms and the lay of the land. All of them staring down with petrified strokes of paint.

And at the far end, before a massive stone fireplace, there was a throne.

Slumped in it was the thing I had seen in the field.

It wasn’t human.

It wasn’t anything.

Its flesh looked sewn together, stretched like old leather or poorly stitched textiles. Its jaw was long. almost animalistic but just plain wrong. Too many teeth. No nose, just a hole. No eyes either Just skin-wrapped sockets that never ended, infinity deep.

And misplaced horns twisted like deer antlers, black and overgrown. Its arm, long and bony, reached toward something in front of it a old, silver, crown with sharp peaks almost like it was forged out of daggers 

Its fingers were skeletal and ended in talons. The arm was wrapped in armor like the knight’s, but cracked and darkened. Similar but warped into a different time.

The creature wore a thick, black cape. The collar was fur, mismatched  prey and predator, hunter and hunted.

It was lifeless.

Hunched.

Dead.

I don’t know why I walked closer. I dont know why I reached out and Touched that crown.

Becacuse That’s when its hand twitched.

I fell backward, scrambling away. Its arm twitched again sharper this time, jerking like a broken puppet. Then it leaned forward, using the table for support.

A sharp crack echoed as its other arm landed with weight. Then, like something rising from a grave, it started to stand.

Its joints popped. Snapped. Every vertebra in its back cracked like breaking branches. Eight feet tall, maybe more with the horns.

I backed away. It was still waking up, if you can call that thing waking.

Its neck bent up, far too slowly. Its jaw opened, wide and yawning. From its throat came a gasping noise that became a growl.
And then unmistakably the word “Who” it sounded angry like a pharo raising to meet a tomb raider

Its eyeless head faced me now. Somehow, it saw me.

It took a step. Dust poured off its robes like falling ash, it was heavy and looked like a toddler taking its first steps but its second step looked sturdier and the third was muscle memory 

I turned. The door wouldn’t open. I slammed into it, again and again. The steps behind me were slow but growing faster. the door burst open. I fell through and landed on my stomach 

I don’t remember crawling. I just remember being on my feet, running through the castle entrance.

The creature didn’t follow. Not fully.

Back in the feilds I turned to look once I was far enough.

He was standing there. Looking at me like an aristocrat. Watching and studying.

For the first time, those eyeless sockets burned. A pair of yellow lights stared through the dusk. Then slowly… he put on the crown and closed the door.

I collapsed in the wheat.

I became part of the land again.

And then I woke up.

I gasped back to life and sat up in bed, covered in a cold sweat. It was still dark out I’d woken up before even my earliest alarm. There was no way I was going back to sleep. Not with that thing still fresh in my mind.

But it wasn’t fear keeping me up. It was infatuation.

I reached for one of my old sketchpads, thumbed through the blank pages, and started drawing.

I didn’t have a name for it yet, but later I started calling him the King.

The kettle boiled and I poured myself a coffee. Three pages of sketches the impossible castle, his face (or what I think was a face), the crown, the painting in the hallway. None of it was my best work, but something about it felt alive. There was potential.

My first class that day was my art workshop. Nothing special just standard uni stuff. But as I packed up, my professor came over to give me some pointers on the mess I’d been working on.
My sketchbook was poking out of my bag. She saw it, casually asked if I’d drawn anything new.

Proud of the chicken scratches I’d made that morning, I flipped to the King’s horrid visiage.

She stared for a moment. Then she gasped not in horror, but excitement.
Within minutes, we were talking about scrapping my current piece and starting a new final project, built around what she called “this surge of inspiration.”

That was it. The King’s portrait was now my new final piece.

And for the first time in weeks maybe months  I felt good. Like I had something real to work toward. Like I’d earned that dream.

But I didn’t know then what I know now.
That it wasn’t just a dream. That he wasn’t just some nightmare.

That he was something older. Something hungrier. Something primordial.

# Coffee Machine with Hot Water Dispenser: Expert Reviews 2025

The modern kitchen demands versatility, and the coffee machine with hot water dispenser perfectly embodies this.

## Key Features Analysis

The coffee machine with hot water dispenser combines the functionalities of two separate appliances into one, offering space-saving convenience and streamlined operation.

**Brewing Capacity**

Brewing capacity is a crucial aspect, determining the amount of coffee that can be brewed at once. Many models offer capacities ranging from 10 to 14 cups, suitable for both individual use and larger households or office settings. Some machines feature programmable settings, allowing users to customize the brew strength and volume to their preferences. The quality of the brewing process, including temperature control and pre-infusion features, also significantly impacts the final taste of the coffee.

**Hot Water Dispenser Capacity and Temperature**

The hot water dispenser's capacity is another key consideration, as it dictates the amount of hot water available for various uses. Typically, these dispensers hold between 30 and 50 ounces of water. The temperature control is equally important, allowing users to select the optimal temperature for different beverages or food preparations. Some advanced models offer precise temperature settings, ensuring that the water is heated to the exact degree required for specific types of tea or instant soups.

**Filtration System**

A high-quality filtration system is essential for removing impurities from the water, enhancing both the taste of the coffee and the longevity of the machine. Many coffee machines with hot water dispensers incorporate activated carbon filters, which effectively remove chlorine, sediment, and other contaminants. Some models also include water hardness testing kits, allowing users to adjust the filtration settings to match their local water supply. Regular filter replacement is crucial for maintaining optimal performance and water quality.

**Programmability and User Interface**

Programmability features enhance the user experience by allowing for customized brewing schedules and settings. Many machines offer programmable timers, allowing users to set the coffee to brew automatically at a specific time. A user-friendly interface, typically featuring an LCD screen and intuitive controls, makes it easy to navigate the various settings and functions. Some models also include smartphone connectivity, enabling users to control the machine remotely and monitor its status.

**Safety Features**

Safety features are paramount, especially considering the presence of hot water and electrical components. Automatic shut-off is a standard safety feature that turns off the machine after a period of inactivity, preventing overheating and potential hazards. Overheat protection mechanisms also ensure that the machine does not exceed safe operating temperatures. Some models include insulated carafes or dispensers to prevent accidental burns.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

Ease of cleaning and maintenance is an important factor for long-term usability. Many coffee machines with hot water dispensers feature removable parts that are dishwasher-safe, simplifying the cleaning process. Descaling programs are also common, helping to remove mineral buildup and maintain optimal performance. Regular cleaning and maintenance are essential for preventing malfunctions and extending the lifespan of the machine.

## Core Benefits

The coffee machine with hot water dispenser provides a multitude of advantages, streamlining beverage preparation and offering enhanced convenience.

**Time Savings:** Combining coffee brewing and hot water dispensing into one appliance saves valuable time in the morning or during busy workdays. Users can quickly brew a pot of coffee and simultaneously prepare tea or other hot beverages without needing separate appliances. This efficiency is particularly beneficial for households or offices with multiple beverage preferences.

**Space Efficiency:** In kitchens with limited counter space, a combination coffee machine and hot water dispenser is a practical solution. It eliminates the need for two separate appliances, freeing up valuable space for other kitchen essentials. This is especially advantageous for apartment dwellers or those with smaller kitchens.

**Cost Savings:** While the initial investment may be higher than purchasing separate appliances, a combination coffee machine and hot water dispenser can offer long-term cost savings. By consolidating two functions into one, it reduces energy consumption and eliminates the need to purchase and maintain two separate appliances. The longevity of the machine, coupled with its efficient operation, contributes to overall cost savings.

**Versatility:** The versatility of a coffee machine with hot water dispenser extends beyond coffee and tea preparation. The hot water dispenser can be used for a variety of purposes, such as making instant soups, oatmeal, or other hot foods. This versatility makes it a valuable addition to any kitchen, catering to a wide range of culinary needs.

**Convenience:** The convenience of having both coffee and hot water readily available from a single appliance cannot be overstated. Whether it's for a quick morning coffee, an afternoon tea, or preparing a simple meal, the coffee machine with hot water dispenser offers unparalleled convenience. The programmable features and user-friendly interface further enhance the overall user experience.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about coffee machines with hot water dispensers.

**What type of water should I use in my coffee machine with hot water dispenser?**
  Using filtered water is highly recommended to improve the taste of your coffee and tea, and to prevent mineral buildup in the machine. Tap water can contain chlorine and other impurities that affect the flavor and can also lead to scale formation, reducing the machine's lifespan.

**How often should I clean my coffee machine with hot water dispenser?**
  Regular cleaning is essential for maintaining optimal performance and preventing malfunctions. The frequency of cleaning depends on the frequency of use and the hardness of your water. Generally, it is recommended to clean the machine every 1-3 months, or more frequently if you notice mineral buildup or a change in the taste of your coffee. Descaling the machine regularly is also important.

**Can I use the hot water dispenser for purposes other than making tea or coffee?**
  Yes, the hot water dispenser can be used for a variety of purposes, such as making instant soups, oatmeal, or other hot foods. It is a versatile appliance that can cater to a wide range of culinary needs. However, it is important to ensure that the water is heated to the appropriate temperature for the specific application.

**What is the average lifespan of a coffee machine with hot water dispenser?**
  The lifespan of a coffee machine with hot water dispenser depends on several factors, including the quality of the machine, the frequency of use, and the level of maintenance. With proper care and maintenance, a high-quality machine can last for 5-7 years or more. Regular cleaning, descaling, and using filtered water can significantly extend the lifespan of the machine.

# Choosing The Right Coffee Percolator

Selecting the [perfect coffee percolator](https://gomehedi.com/best-percolator-coffee-maker/) involves understanding how to use it effectively. Fill the pot with water, add your favorite ground coffee, and place it on the stove. Watch for the gentle percolation sound, signaling rich coffee ready to enjoy.

Choosing the right coffee percolator can make all the difference in your morning routine. Whether you’re a seasoned coffee aficionado or a curious beginner, understanding the nuances of different models can elevate your coffee experience. Selecting the perfect percolator isn’t just about the brand name; it’s about finding a model that suits your lifestyle and coffee preferences.

# Materials And Build Quality

The material of a coffee percolator affects both its durability and flavor. Stainless steel models are popular for their longevity and resistance to stains. They can withstand high temperatures, ensuring your coffee is brewed to perfection. On the other hand, glass percolators offer a visually pleasing brewing process, allowing you to watch the magic happen. However, they are more fragile and require careful handling. Consider your kitchen environment. If kids or pets are around, stainless steel might be safer. If aesthetics are important, a glass model could be a delightful addition.

# Electric Vs. Stovetop Models

Electric percolators are convenient. They offer automatic brewing with consistent results, perfect for busy mornings. You simply plug it in, add water and coffee, and let the machine do the work. They’re ideal for those who prefer ease and reliability. Stovetop models, however, provide a more hands-on experience. They let you control the brewing time and temperature, which can lead to a richer flavor. If you enjoy the ritual of brewing coffee, the stovetop model offers a rewarding process. Which one suits your lifestyle? If you value convenience and consistency, electric is your friend. If you savor the art of coffee making, the stovetop model might be your best match.

# Preparing Your Coffee Percolator

Brewing coffee with a percolator is an art. It starts with proper preparation. This ensures a rich and flavorful cup of coffee. The steps are simple yet crucial. From cleaning to selecting the right grind, each step matters.

# Cleaning And Assembling

Start by cleaning your coffee percolator. Rinse all parts with warm water. Use mild soap to remove old coffee oils. Scrub gently to avoid scratches. Dry all parts completely. This prevents rust and mold. Assemble the percolator correctly. Place the stem in the pot. Attach the basket on top. Ensure the lid fits securely. A tight seal is key for brewing.

Alright, friends, let’s get real for a sec. Have you ever found yourself just... stuck? 🥴 You know what I’m talking about—you spend hours (maybe even DAYS) spinning your wheels over that one project or decision. You’re juggling options, analyzing every angle, and by the end, you’ve made zero progress. Sound familiar? 

**Enter: The 5-Minute Rule.** 🎉 This little gem has saved me from the clutches of perfectionism more times than I can count. It’s super simple: if you spend just **five minutes** on something and you’ve gotten it to a point where it’s *good enough,* then guess what? It’s DONE. 

Here’s why this works:

- **Perfection is an illusion.** Seriously, there’s no such thing as perfect. You could tweak and polish something forever, but at what cost?
- **Five minutes is manageable.** Who can’t spare five minutes? Even if you feel overwhelmed, just seeing what you can accomplish in that short time can shift your perspective.
- **Momentum matters.** The hardest part is often just starting. By giving yourself permission to let go of “perfect,” you create a chance for momentum to kick in. You know, that magical feeling when you’re on a roll? 🚀 

So, how do we actually put this into practice? Here are some ideas:

1. **Set a timer.** Literally, just grab your phone and set a five-minute countdown. You’d be surprised how productive you can get with that little deadline hovering over you!
  
2. **Define “done.”** Before you dive in, ask yourself: What does “done” look like for this task? Is it sending an email, drafting an outline, or creating a quick sketch? Write it down!

3. **Make it fun.** If you can make the process enjoyable, you’re more likely to dive in. Throw on your favorite playlist, make a nice cup of coffee, or reward yourself with a small treat afterward.

4. **Embrace imperfection.** It’s okay if it’s not 100% what you envisioned. Remember, you can always improve later, but if you keep waiting for perfection, you might miss some awesome opportunities.

And hey, it’s not about being reckless! You still want to ensure quality. But sometimes you gotta throw caution to the wind and JUST DO IT. 

**Quick story time:** I used to agonize over my blog posts for days, sitting at my desk staring at a blinking cursor. Then, I started applying this 5-minute rule. One day, I set my timer and just wrote. It wasn’t my best work, but I hit publish! Guess what? That post got more engagement than I thought it would. Crazy, right? 😵

So, next time you find yourself caught in that spiral of thought, just remember that *done is better than perfect.* And who knows? You might end up surprising yourself with what you create in just five minutes!

1mb5fkc,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1mb5fkc/stressed_scattered_i_tried_cold_exposure_box/,Stressed & Scattered? 🧠 I Tried Cold Exposure + Box Breathing for 7 Days: Here’s My Nervous System Reset (Backed by HRV Data) 🌬️,"Hey MaximizeMe fam! 🌟

Ever feel like your brain is doing the cha-cha while you’re trying to focus on life's waltz? You're not alone! 🤯 Last week, I was all kinds of scattered—like trying to herd cats while juggling (seriously, who can relate?). I decided to give my nervous system a little *reset* by trying something new: **Cold Exposure + Box Breathing for 7 Days**. Let me spill the icy tea. ❄️

First off, **what's box breathing?** Picture this: inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4, and hold for another 4. Easy peasy, right? But pair that with cold exposure (yes, I'm talking ice baths or super cold showers), and you've got yourself a spicy little cocktail for calming those frayed nerves! 🛁

**Day 1:** ***Shock therapy*** anyone?! Jumped into the cold, regretted every life decision for about 10 seconds, then actually started feeling... alive? And hey, that box breathing? Well, it kept me from sprinting for the warm blankets, so win-win!

**By Day 3:** My body was like, ""Hey, this isn't so bad."" My focus was clearer, and the overwhelming urge to snack every 20 minutes mysteriously vanished. It felt like my mind was finally in sync with the *rest* of me.

**Day 5:** HRV (heart rate variability) data check! 📊 Spoiler: It was awesome! My body's stress response was more chill than me on a Saturday morning. Think of your HRV like a window into how relaxed (or not) your nervous system is. Let's just say, mine was throwing a low-key beach party!

**By Day 7:** Who even needs caffeine? (Just kidding, I still love coffee.) But honestly, the combo of cold exposure with deliberate breathing felt like I’d cleared away mental cobwebs. The scattered feeling? Practically gone! 🎉

Here’s what I learned, and why I think you might wanna try it too:

- **Instant Zen:** The shock of cold paired with controlled breathing forces you into the present moment. Kind of like instant meditation on steroids. 💪
  
- **Energy Boost:** After the initial OMG-I’m-gonna-freeze moment, there’s a rush of energy and vitality. It’s like someone hit the refresh button on your brain.

- **Focus Galore:** Forget multitasking chaos; clarity actually becomes a thing. Who knew cold could cure mental clutter?

- **Quantifiable Calm:** Real talk—using HRV made tracking the benefits less “woo-woo” and more science-backed. Who else loves a good data story?

So, wrapping up my 7-day experiment, I’m walking away with a newfound appreciation for, well, freezing my buns off in the name of sanity. Is it everyone’s cup of (iced) tea? Maybe not, but sometimes a little chill is just what you need to heat up your productivity and peace of mind. 😉

Have you tried cold exposure or box breathing? If you’re curious about it or have your own tips, feel free to share your thoughts (or tales of defrosting)! Remember, we’re all here to squeeze the most out of life—one icy plunge at a time! 🌊💙

On February 19th, I started drinking Monster as a kind of game, having one daily, sometimes with breaks of 3 or 4 days. I even had two Monsters in a single day once (just that one time). This continued until May 18th, when I started experiencing mild chest pains and a racing heart, so I decided to stop.
I completely cut out Monster and replaced it with iced tea and caffeine-free cold drinks because I'm worried and want my heart to be healthy. For about a month, I was pain-free for a while, and in that time I even had a regular checkup with my primary care provider and all the blood work and auscultation was okay, but a few weeks ago, I woke up at 2 AM with a very fast heartbeat and nausea. I got a bit scared, but I layed down after eating a banana (in case my blood sugar was low) and fell back asleep. However, in the afternoon, the nausea and racing heart returned. These symptoms went on for a while, until some weeks later they stopped for a few days. Then, the other day the same thing happened again, and it hasn't relieved by now. These symptoms do not occur all the time, by example when I'm distracted or whatever i feel on peace. I don't know if I'm at risk for a heart condition, if it's just anxiety, or if something else is going on. I don't plan on drinking Monster or coffee again for a long time, but I would like a professional cardiologist's opinion.

To change things up, I started reaching out to former colleagues, not to ask for jobs, but just to reconnect and explore ideas. I thought maybe a conversation would open a door.

To my surprise, many didn’t respond. Some ignored me completely. It was a bit discouraging, and honestly, pretty isolating.

Fast forward to today. I’ve landed a dream role with a high-growth, GenAI player. And now… the same people who didn’t respond are suddenly popping into my inbox to say congrats and ask to catch up..

When I throw up it’s always really old food sometimes undigested, sometimes it’s watery. It always smells even worse than the burps. On top of that I have this awful diarrhea.

I (24M) have been dating my girlfriend (24F) for about 8 months now, and overall our relationship has been going well. We communicate decently and care a lot about each other. But there's one thing I’ve been sitting with, and I wanted an outside perspective.

My girlfriend is very socially active and goes to a lot of networking events, which I fully support. She’s ambitious, independent, and great at building connections. Sometimes after these events, she’ll meet up with someone one-on-one, and I don’t usually find out who it was until after, if at all. For example, she recently had a networking event and ended up getting coffee with someone for about two hours. 

When I asked her about it later, she didn’t really share much; no name or details, just kind of moved on. And this has happened before. Sometimes when she hangs out with friends, she’ll say “I’m going to hang out with a friend” or “doing X” but won’t offer more unless I specifically ask. She’s always willing to answer questions, but I don’t want to feel like I have to interview her to stay in the loop.

For the record, I trust her. She’s bisexual, but I don’t think gender changes anything here. I just want a general sense of openness. I trust that she wouldn’t keep in contact with people she’s had romantic or physical history with. This isn’t about suspicion. it’s about feeling like I’m connected to her day-to-day life. I try to be really open about who I spend time with, and I’d feel more secure if that openness went both ways.

She’s also not a secretive person in general. she even suggested we share locations early on (she shares locations with her friends too, more as a safety thing). So I don’t think this is intentional, but it still leaves me feeling like a part of her world is walled off unless I ask about it.

I want to bring this up gently, without sounding controlling or jealous, because that’s not where I’m coming from. I just value transparency and feeling emotionally included. Is it fair to ask for that kind of openness? And what’s a good way to bring it up without making it a big deal?

Thanks in advance.

1mb537z,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialLiteracyPH/comments/1mb537z/pisoproof_your_wallet_math_mindset_methods_saving/,"Piso-Proof Your Wallet: {Math, Mindset & Methods} Saving Tips That You Should Know","LET'S face it — sometimes, you can say that saving now can feel impossible. You’re battling uncertainties, low wages, toxic family expectations, and impulsive spending temptations every single day.

But with smart planning, behavioral tricks, and math on your side — **you CAN beat the system**.

---

# 🎯 1. Set a Tangible, Emotion-Based Goal

**Why it matters**: Saving is psychological. When your “why” is real (a sick parent, a dream business), you're less likely to spend emotionally.

**Better goal**: ""I want to build a ₱50,000 emergency fund in 10 months to avoid utang during emergencies.""

📊 **Math**: ₱50,000 ÷ 10 = ₱5,000/month  
→ ₱167/day. Save this by cooking more, cancelling that streaming subscription, or getting a ₱500/week sideline.

🔎 *Practical Insight*: Print your goal and track your progress visually. Behavioral science proves visible milestones motivate better than vague intentions.

---

# 🤖 2. Automate Your Savings, Then Hide It

Set up an auto-transfer to a separate digital bank with no debit card access.

**Scenario**: Earn ₱18,000/month  
Auto-save ₱1,500 → After 12 months = ₱18,000

📌 *Tip*: Use banks with interest rates 3–6% p.a. — your savings won’t just sit, they’ll grow passively.

🔎 *Practical Insight*: Rename your account to ""Do Not Touch — For Emergency Only"" to create a psychological barrier before withdrawing.

---

# 📈 3. Track Expenses Religiously for 30 Days

**Why**: You can’t fix what you don’t measure. Most Filipinos don’t realize they spend ₱5,000–₱7,000/month on avoidable habits.

**How**:
- Use Monefy or Wallet app  
- Log everything manually for 30 days (this creates “pain of paying”)

**Real Case**:  
A jeep + coffee + fast food habit =  
₱40 x 2 (jeep) + ₱150 (milk tea) + ₱250 (lunch) = ₱480/day  
→ ₱9,600/month gone.

🔎 *Practical Insight*: Your budget doesn’t fail from big purchases — it's the **daily ₱200 leaks** that drown you.

---

# 💼 4. Minimum Wage Earner Blueprint

Minimum wage: ~₱610/day → ~₱13,000/month (NCR estimate after deductions)

**Realistic Saving**: Save ₱50/day = ₱1,500/month  
→ ₱18,000/year

**Challenge**: Do a “no-spend weekend” every 2 weeks  
→ Save ₱500–₱1,000/month from leisure/transport expenses

🔎 *Practical Insight*: Use “replacement psychology” — instead of spending ₱150 on milk tea, brew ₱10 on your own and move the ₱140 to your savings.

---

# 🎓 5. Student Savings Without a Job

📌 Average baon: ₱150/day  
→ Save ₱30/day (20%) = ₱660/month  
In 10 months = ₱6,600 — enough for a used phone, certification, or startup capital

🧠 *Mindset Trick*: Convert spending into opportunity cost.  
“Do I want this burger or a future side hustle?”

🔎 *Practical Insight*: Open a digital savings account early. Financial literacy improves dramatically when you manage even small amounts.

---

# 🌍 6. OFW Financial Framework

📌 Sending ₱20,000/month home? Keep at least ₱5,000/month for yourself.

💼 Scenario: Save ₱5,000/month in Pag-IBIG MP2  
→ After 5 years with 6% avg. dividend: ~₱340,000+

Target: 3–6 months’ worth of expenses  
Example: ₱15,000/month budget → ₱45,000–₱90,000 fund

**Plan**: Save ₱1,875/month  
→ ₱45,000 in 24 months

💡 *Behavioral trick*: Store this in a separate account with **no mobile access** — out of sight = out of reach.

🔎 *Practical Insight*: Start small if needed. Even ₱500/month builds discipline.

While I was traveling last week, my wife was home and said we had big storm. Thunder, lighting and rain, but no damage to our home. The power in our home actually never went out. 

That said, since then, electricity in our home has been acting up ever since. Occasionally lights in our home will flicker or wobble, in different rooms and at different times. This will happen even if we barely have anything running in the whole house, so I don’t think it is about us using a lot of stuff at once. Besides lighting, our toaster oven is now intermittently turning on and off, even when not in use. I think it is losing its minimum threshold for power and turning off, beeping back on, etc. I have once noticed a similar wobbling in the LED on my coffee machine, at the same time the toaster oven was acting up. Today I noticed the light in my garage will flick on with the switch, for one second, and then cut out. All of this seems to have been caused by the storm. 

All I’ve done, or frankly know how to do, is go to my breaker. I switched everything off at once. Waited a bit. Then switched everything back on. The issue has persisted though.

I have a hunch that it’s more about the power supply than my home itself. So I don’t know if I should be calling an electrician? I figured I’d start with posting here. If you tell me I should be calling the city, or my electricity utility company instead, I’ll do that. 

For context, in case it matters, I’m based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

# Pup cup: 2025's Best Treat? Expert Review!

The pup cup,a seemingly simple concoction of whipped cream served in a small cup,has rapidly evolved from a niche offering at select coffee shops to a mainstream treat beloved by dogs adn their owners alike. This seemingly trivial indulgence has become a symbol of the human-animal bond and a notable driver of customer engagement for businesses. As we enter 2025, it's time to take a closer look at the pup cup and explore its potential as the ultimate treat for our canine companions.This review will examine the pup cup's features,benefits,and its position within the broader market of dog-friendly treats,offering a comprehensive assessment of its value and appeal.

[[Explore Top Rated pup cup on Amazon.]](https://blogs.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=pup cup)

## Key Features Analysis

The pup cup's appeal lies in its simplicity and widespread availability. Though, variations in ingredients and presentation contribute to its overall quality.

**Ingredient Composition**

While the base of a pup cup is typically whipped cream,the quality and source of this cream greatly influence the treat's safety and nutritional value. A superior pup cup uses heavy cream with minimal additives, avoiding artificial sweeteners or excessive sugar. Some establishments also offer dairy-free alternatives made from coconut or soy-based whipped toppings, catering to dogs with sensitivities. The use of natural vanilla extract is considered a plus, adding a subtle flavor that appeals to some dogs.

**Cup material and Size**

The cup itself plays a role in the overall experience. Smaller portions are ideal for puppies and small breeds, preventing overindulgence. Sturdy, food-grade paper or compostable cups are preferred for environmental reasons and to prevent potential chemical leaching. A cup that is easy for dogs to access without tipping over also enhances the enjoyment.

**Presentation and Customization**

Beyond the basic whipped cream, some establishments offer creative pup cup variations. These might include a sprinkle of dog-friendly toppings, such as crushed dog biscuits, a drizzle of peanut butter, or a single blueberry. Visually appealing presentations can increase the pup cup's perceived value and make it a more shareable experience on social media. Customization allows owners to cater to their dog's specific tastes and dietary needs, further enhancing the experience.**Nutritional Considerations**

It is indeed vital to acknowledge the nutritional impact of pup cups, even in the context of an occasional treat. High-quality pup cups minimize unhealthy ingredients like sugar and artificial additives. Offering smaller serving sizes and providing nutritional information (calories, fat content) promotes responsible pet ownership. Some establishments even offer ""healthy"" pup cup options with reduced fat content or added probiotics.

Key features of the pup cup include:

* Simple ingredient list
* Small portion size
* Palatable flavor (dogs generally like it; appealing texture)
* Readily sourced pretty much anywhere that sells coffee

## Core Benefits

The pup cup's popularity stems from its numerous benefits, both for dogs and their owners.

**Enhanced Socialization and Bonding**

Sharing a pup cup creates a positive and memorable experience for both the dog and its owner. It provides an chance for socialization in public spaces like coffee shops and parks, strengthening the bond between pet and owner. The act of offering a treat reinforces positive behavior and creates a sense of trust and affection.

**Positive Reinforcement and Training Aid**

The pup cup can be used as a high-value reward during training sessions. Its novelty and deliciousness make it a highly effective motivator for dogs, encouraging them to learn new commands and behaviors. The small size allows for frequent use without overfeeding, making it a practical tool for positive reinforcement training.

**Increased Emotional Well-being for Dogs**

The simple joy of enjoying a appetizing treat can significantly improve a dog's emotional well-being. Pup cups provide a moment of sensory pleasure and excitement, contributing to a happier and more relaxed state. The act of giving a pup cup can also alleviate boredom and provide mental stimulation,especially for dogs that spend a lot of time indoors.

**Business Benefits for Coffee Shops/Establishments**

offering pup cups attracts dog owners to businesses, increasing foot traffic and revenue. It creates a pet-friendly atmosphere, fostering positive brand associations. The pup cup also serves as a highly shareable marketing tool,as owners often post photos and videos of their dogs enjoying the treat on social media,generating free advertising.

## FAQs Section

**Are pup cups safe for all dogs?**
While pup cups are generally safe for most dogs when given in moderation, it's essential to consider individual dietary needs and health conditions. Dogs with lactose intolerance or dairy allergies should avoid traditional whipped cream pup cups and opt for dairy-free alternatives. Puppies and dogs with sensitive stomachs may require smaller portions. Always consult with your veterinarian if you have concerns about your dog's suitability for pup cups.

**How frequently enough can I give my dog a pup cup?**
Pup cups should be considered occasional treats, not a regular part of your dog's diet. The frequency depends on your dog's size, activity level, and overall health. A small pup cup onc or twice a week is generally acceptable for most adult dogs. Avoid giving pup cups daily, as the high fat and sugar content can contribute to weight gain and other health problems.

**Can I make pup cups at home?**
Yes, making pup cups at home is a simple and cost-effective way to control the ingredients and portion sizes. Use heavy cream, coconut cream, or a dog-friendly yogurt as the base. Avoid adding sugar or artificial sweeteners. You can also add dog-friendly toppings like blueberries, peanut butter, or crushed dog biscuits. Homemade pup cups allow for greater customization and ensure that the treat is tailored to your dog's specific needs.

For owners prioritizing convenience and social experiences, the pup cup provides significant value despite its low nutritional content. Homemade treats provide the most control over ingredients and nutritional value but require more effort and planning.

Has anyone here actually tried the supplement from the brand or Buck Naked specifically? Did it make any noticeable difference for you—energy, appetite, actual fat loss? Or is it more of a placebo/marketing thing?

1mb4u4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1mb4u4k/downgloom/,"""Downgloom""","Late December. It's quite cold. The snowy weather outside the car continues throughout the night. The sparkling icy cold specks of ice fall from the skies above, with the moon nearly abstracted by the looming clouds.

The snow lands all around. And yet, sometimes, it never sticks forever. Always melting away before the next one comes to take its place on this floating space rock we all stand on.

I can't exactly describe how I felt at the moment. Driving endlessly through the cold, looking for my final destination through the snow, and being quite cold through it all. 

It is quite cold, indeed. Not just from the weather outside, but the very feeling I'm experiencing right now. 

I kept the heater running for as much as I possibly can, continuing to focus on the road ahead of me. No signs of anything or anyone around. The last thing I could say that I saw was only a couple of cars and an ambulance. But after that, there was nothing.

Just a straight empty road ahead of me.

It's bizarre, isn't it? Driving throughout this wintery, blue night, and yet, even within a warm car, it's always quite cold. But not just any kind of cold... a cold that sometimes never ceases to disappear. 

An hour would pass by as I would soon realize that my car was slowly running out of fuel. I looked around to see if there would be any kind of stop to try and fuel up.

Luckily, after going through a few horizons, I came across a little convenience store. With a gas station and everything. 

I pulled up to the place, looking at it with ease as I turned my car off. The sign above read, ""HIGH 5,"" in bright neon blue. Surprisingly, the place was still open, with the open sign still on. 

I took a deep breath as I got out of the car and into the cold, winter night. I held my coat tightly, seemingly trying to keep all of my body warmth from exiting into the cold night air. It was quite cold.

I walked into the convenience store, still quite cold, and made my way towards the hot coffee area to try and warm myself up a bit. 

As I was pouring hot coffee for myself, I began to feel the cold sensation of...  worry. Something seemed off at first, and I wasn't exactly paying much attention to realize that there was nobody around.

Not even a store clerk in sight. 

I looked around, calling for anybody to see if they were still here to try and have the pump for gas open for me. But no matter how much I searched, the convenience store was completely dead.

And I soon began to feel cold again. Quite cold, actually. I think it was a breeze from the weather outside that made its way inside, but even then, those front doors were shut tight. 

The feeling of unease began to fill me to the brim, as I made my way around the counter to try and release the pump for myself, but when I went around to do so, I saw a bunch of coffee cups all over the floor behind the counter. 

I thought to myself how utterly disgusting that was. Maybe whoever was working the night shift just didn't bother to clean themselves up before leaving. 

But even with that thought, I was still unsure. I clenched my coat close. It was still so, so cold. The lights above began to flicker on and off. I quickly ran out of the store, accidentally dropping my cup of coffee.

I quickly got into my car, continuing to try and warm myself up. My heart raced with large echoes of beats pounding against my chest. It was quite cold.

I closed my eyes, trying to calm myself down in the car. As I opened my eyes back up and looked out into the snowfall outside, I noticed that the High 5 outside had completely vanished.

And even stranger, my fuel meter was at a maximum full tank. 

""What the fuck?"", I thought to myself.

That's when I began to have this... weird feeling. This... bizarre, cold feeling inside of me. As I began to drive off, I kept thinking to myself that something was following me.

Or maybe it was some... idea. Some kind of... truth.

I kept thinking about the cars I saw earlier during my drive. That cold feeling grew. But it was... different. A different kind of cold. A cold that I couldn't even describe in words that would come out of my own mouth, with heated breaths appearing in thin air. 

It would soon turn to an hour and a half.

I kept trying to find a hotel. A place where I could sleep for the night.

But I would never find one. No hotel, no gas stop, no parking lot, absolutely nothing. As I made a stop. And I got out of my car, into the cold night. With in front of me, a bunch of cars were parked.

Many people gathered in large chunks. Heated breaths filled the air, and distress was present alongside the huddling of much needed warmth. 

An ambulance car was there. And they were carrying away someone in the back of their car. They looked so pale. So frozen over. So cold.

My head began to hurt. I turned back to my car, as my head began to hurt more and more, like a large needle was poking at my brain that stung my eyeballs. And when I looked back... complete emptiness.

No cars. No ambulance. No people. Just me, my car, and the dark road ahead of me. I got into my car, still seeing that my fuel was still at 100. 

I began to slowly drive, while looking at my window to the car that was stuck in the snow. And that's when I realized.

That cold, downglooming feeling loomed over me. It was something I was running away from in seek of warmth. But would never find in the long run.

And that's when I remembered, as I kept on driving through the never-ending valley of a never-ending season of coldness. It was the last thing I could really remember. 

The windshield was covered in white.

Icy specks fell more and more.

And I had finally gotten to my final destination.

It's quite cold.

I wasn’t searching for love, validation, or even connection. But somehow, we clicked. There was chemistry between us, the kind that just flows without effort. He made me laugh, he seemed genuine, and for a while, I really thought something meaningful could come from it.

From the beginning, he told me he doesn’t stay friends with exes. I was okay with that. I trusted him. I wasn’t the jealous type, and I believed that if someone gives you no reason to doubt them, you return the same trust.

But then his ex came back into the picture. Slowly, then more boldly. After she saw us together at a coffee shop, she suddenly had things she needed him to pick up, wanted help editing a video, invited him to brunch. It felt disrespectful. Not just her presence, but his lack of clear boundaries. When I brought it up, he got distant, like I was overreacting. And that confused me even more. It almost felt like he mentioned her just to see if I’d get jealous, and then when I finally reacted, he dropped the whole thing.

Still, I gave him grace. Again and again. I made an effort. I was kind. I didn’t do those things because I was desperate, I did them because that’s who I am. But over time, I started realizing I was doing all the emotional work. I’d spend time overthinking tiny arguments, wondering if he was still mad or if I had gone too far. He never reassured me. He never showed up emotionally the way I needed. I was carrying the weight of the relationship alone.

I communicated clearly. I told him what wasn’t working, what I needed to feel safe and valued. And every time, he told me I was right. He promised to change. But nothing ever did.

One of the final straws was when I told him that things between us didn’t feel good anymore. That we were losing something, and that I needed effort real effort. Instead of showing up, he left me on delivered for hours. Twice. That silence felt like a slap. So I made a decision: if he truly wanted to reach me, he’d call. I was done being the one who responded immediately while he took his time. I was done being emotionally available to someone who only showed up when it was convenient.

So I stopped replying to his texts. And a day later, he resent a message asking where I was. I still didn’t answer not because I was playing games, but because I’d decided: if he genuinely cared, he’d pick up the phone and call. He never did.

And that was the moment I realized the effort had always come from me. In the beginning, he made time, he made effort, he pursued me. But slowly, that faded. I had to ask for what used to be given freely. And that’s when I ghosted him( not out of immaturity, but out of clarity). Out of the exhaustion that comes from being in a relationship where your needs are always ""something to fix later"" and never something that’s actually prioritized.

And the thing is, I don’t regret being kind. I don’t regret giving him chances. Because now I know, with full certainty, that I did everything I could. I showed up. No one can say I didn’t try. Not even him.

But here's the part that still sits heavy with me: I don’t know if he ever liked me for me, or if he just liked the idea of me. People often say I’m “wifey material,” someone anyone would be lucky to have. Maybe he felt that too but not because he truly saw me, just because he didn’t want to miss out on something that looked good on the surface. I think he liked how I looked, maybe even my personality at first. But deep down, I think he liked the version of me that served his ego, not the full version that needed care and reciprocity.

Eventually, the silence started. Four days of nothing. And during that time, I kept wondering, ""Am I still in a relationship, or am I single now?"" It was like being stuck in limbo emotionally abandoned but technically still “his.” And then I heard from a friend (the same one who introduced us) after a month and 1 half of no contact that he told her I was the one who ignored him. That broke me a little. He rewrote the story. He erased everything I did and flipped the narrative to protect his pride. It made me feel invisible.

And here’s the truth I hate admitting: a part of me still wants him to come back crawling. I want him to feel what it’s like to lose someone who made love easy. I want him to regret taking me for granted. I want him to remember the softness I gave him and realize that it wasn’t common, it wasn’t average, and it won’t come again.

At the same time, if he ever did come back, a part of me would still want to greet him with kindness. Not because he deserves it, but because that’s who I am. I want him to remember what it felt like to be treated with grace and if that memory haunts him, so be it.

I’ve realized I don’t need closure or revenge. I don’t even need answers. What I need is peace. And peace, for me, is knowing I loved fully and walked away when that love was no longer being honored.",1,1753670486.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False
