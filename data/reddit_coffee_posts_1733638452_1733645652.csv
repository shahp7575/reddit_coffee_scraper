1h9e48e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crippled_Alcoholics/comments/1h9e48e/no_mediocrity/,No mediocrity.,"One of my few posts. Sat in the caribou coffee parking lot 4 days sober at  noon. Got a coffee. Went on a 5 day bender over thanksgiving break ending on Sunday. Called off work on Monday because I was going through WD.  Finally getting somewhat normal. But in my mind I thought “hey I can get a small bottle and just chill today”. Grabbed a .75 of new Amsterdam. Cranked it through today. When I’m drinking (and I mean DRINKING) I don’t drink for the taste or whatever I always drink vodka to get toasted. I can do over half a 1.75 easy. Now I’m laying in bed, can’t sleep, don’t feel nearly as drunk and what was the point? I feel buzzed but not wasted where I’m watching punisher videos or some shit 😂. Idk it’s either don’t remember how I ended up in bed or there’s no point. Now I just can’t sleep and am sitting here. Might have to smoke a joint.

I asked for her number while chatting in the app but she said she doesn’t give it out until meeting someone.  Which is fine.

We went on a coffee date today that lasted about 2 hours.  I thought it went well and at the end I said “I already know I want to see you again”. I found her answer strange, she said she would message me later as she had an event she needed to attend and she probably wouldn’t get back to me until the morning.

She said she knows I asked for her number before and that she’s comfortable giving it to me, she just won’t get back to me until later or the morning.

I found it strange because I figure if she was interested, she would just give it to me right there in person?  In my mind I took it as trying not to offend me.

Wanted to see if others would read it the same way.  We’re still matched on the app and I messaged her when getting home stating again that I enjoyed talking to her and would love to see her again and to let me know.

Here goes.

Met someone on a dating app 4 months ago. Very quickly they had a face-time call with me and said they wanted to come and see me, but could not because they were leaving the country for some weeks. But we could face-time while they were away.

They texted while away, but would not call or face-time. I sometimes got a short text when I tried, saying. I will tell you when it's possible. They also messaged me after a couple of weeks and said they would be gone longer.

We kept texting and fell into the habit they started of goodnight texts. I text information about my life, they very little, but did send some holiday pictures.

Since they got back, I was expecting to see them. It's not happened. I prefer to call than text and communicated this with them in a respectful and kind manner. I have tried calling, they once answered the phone during a work-day, but never have in the evening or at weekends, even when we had explicit text arrangement to have a call. They have called me a few times and we have face-timed a few of times.

I tried to break the communication off, by texting 'for whatever reason/s, you do not seem to be available to start a relationship' and all the best.

They text me and called me the same day, I gave in and they got me on face-time and talked me into not giving up. They asked me why I thought they weren't available, with an accusatory grin. I repeated for whatever reason. I explained to them that in my culture it is extremely disrespectful to say you will do something and then not do it. They first said no no it's personality, but did listen, showed conflict resolution skills and changed their behaviour for a while.

We were supposed to meet a month ago, but 2 hours before the date they text me to say they were in the hospital. I tried to call but they did not answer said they were with the doctor and sent me two pictures of them in hospital. Since then I have been ill so not available until this weekend.

Twice i have heard the excuses for why they did not call me as being 'my friend had an accident, i had to go and help and my battery ran out'.And twice, they could not meet me because they were helping a friend move house. I do not believe these excuses.

Otherwise, they are always busy with work. Which is understandable due to their job and current global happenings.

Last time I spoke with them, I said I am putting a time limit on this. If we do not meet before the next full moon (2 1/2 weeks) we will never meet.

I also said I think we might be looking for different things, I am excited about starting a relationship with someone who wants to spend time together at the weekend when I have time. They turned their whole upper body away from the camera and looked at the floor. Well it's one week to go and still no offer of a date.

On Friday, I text, let's have a call. They replied, as they always do, after I am asleep, phone on silent. We can have a call tomorrow sweetheart :) I will call you tomorrow. I voice messaged in the day, ""looking forward to speaking with you, I will be home after 5pm"". 9pm rolls around, no call, I was not expecting one due to their track record, but hoping when my phone pinged it was them (FFS). I send the message '...?'

And this morning i wake up to nothing, not the usual goodnight sweet dreams and sorry for the late reply.

P.S. I went on two coffee dates this weekend with other people. Neither of which I found compatible.

SWANSEA STORIES 🦢

Here’s a taster of what you can expect from the new Wedneday edition of Swansea Scoop. In Swansea Stories, we shine a light on the people doing fun, interesting, and important work in the city.

This time, meet Paula Stockley, founder of The Rucksack Appeal Swansea.

Tell us a little about yourself: I set up The Rucksack Appeal Swansea in 2016 after having a nervous breakdown and volunteering at Zac's Place. I was baptised in 2016 and God put the homeless on my heart. All year round I fundraise and collect items to support those in need. Last Christmas I provided 60 Rucksacks and this summer it increased to 70. I'm aiming for 70+ rucksacks again this Christmas.

What do you love most about living in Swansea? That in minutes I can be on the beach, up a hill, or on a canal.

Favourite Swansea dining spot? The Secret, as it's where Parkrun takes place every Saturday, of which I have been a Run Director since it started in 2015.

What’s your go-to spot to relax and unwind? I love running on the coastal path. Stunning views all along it.

What’s one hidden gem in Swansea that more people should know about? The canal path, as it’s a lovely place to walk, run, and cycle.

What’s a memorable experience or moment you’ve had in Swansea? Volunteering at various sporting events, including handing out medals at the 70.3 Ironman.

How do you think Swansea has changed for the better, and where do you see it heading? Swansea has improved by ensuring it is a city of sanctuary and learning, and a safe space for everyone. I hope it will continue to develop social housing and enable a safe space for all.

Do you have a Swansea Story you want to tell? Reply to this e-mail or email me at [swanseascoop@gmail.com](mailto:swanseascoop@gmail.com) to let me know!

1h9e1ov,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1h9e1ov/bloodlines_part_2/,Bloodlines Part 2,"For weeks after the fire, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone. The city buzzed around me, people rushing to work, horns blaring in traffic, but I was always looking over my shoulder. Every shadow seemed to stretch toward me, every whisper on the wind seemed to know my name.

I had nothing but the clothes I ran out with and a handful of cash I’d hidden in my room. It wasn’t much, but enough to rent a small, dingy apartment on the edge of town. The walls were thin, and the smell of mildew clung to the air. At night, I’d huddle under my blankets, clutching the dull knife I kept by my side for protection.

The nightmares started almost immediately.

In them, I was back in the Varner house. The flames were gone, replaced by the suffocating darkness of the basement. The altar loomed before me, the twisted symbols on the walls writhing like living things. Gloria and Harold were there, their eyes glassy, their smiles too wide, their voices chanting in a language I didn’t understand.

I’d wake up drenched in sweat, gasping for air. But the worst part wasn’t the dreams—it was the marks they left behind.

One morning, I found a thin, jagged scratch running down my arm. Another day, there was a bruise on my ankle, shaped like fingers. I told myself I must be thrashing in my sleep, hitting the edge of the bed or the nightstand. But deep down, I knew that wasn’t true.

Something was still with me.


---

One night, as I was coming home from my shift at a coffee shop, I found a package sitting outside my door. It was wrapped in plain brown paper, no return address. My name was scrawled across the top in familiar, spidery handwriting.

My hands shook as I carried it inside. I locked the door, wedged a chair under the knob, and sat at the kitchen table. For a long time, I just stared at the package, dread coiling in my stomach.

Finally, I opened it.

Inside was the red ribbon.

The same ribbon I’d found in the trunk, the one that had bound the letters about the blood debt. It was frayed and stained, but unmistakable. Beneath it was a small, leather-bound book.

I flipped through the pages, my breath catching in my throat. The book was a journal, filled with entries written in Gloria’s hand. The words revealed things I wish I could unlearn.

""The vessel resists. But the ritual will proceed as planned.""

""It has been decades since the last blood moon. This time, we cannot fail.""

""Her blood carries the key. Our survival depends on it.""

The final entry was dated the day of the fire.

""Tonight, she will fulfill her purpose. The flames will not cleanse her. Blood binds, and blood always returns.""

I slammed the book shut, my hands trembling. That’s when I noticed something else in the box: a photo.

It was an old black-and-white picture of a group of people standing outside a cabin. They were smiling, but their eyes were hollow, their faces unnerving in their stillness. And there, in the middle of the group, was me.

I stumbled back, my chair scraping against the floor. It couldn’t be me—it shouldn’t be me. The photo was decades old, the edges yellowed with time. But the girl in the picture was identical to me, down to the scar on my chin from when I fell off my bike as a kid.

I didn’t sleep that night.


---

The next morning, I decided to leave town. It didn’t matter where I went, as long as it was far away. I packed my things and headed for the bus station.

The streets were unusually quiet. No cars, no people, just an eerie stillness. It reminded me of the moments before a storm.

As I turned the corner, I saw them.

Gloria and Harold, standing across the street.

They looked the same as they had the night of the fire—unburned, unchanged. Harold smiled, raising a hand in a mock wave. Gloria tilted her head, her eyes locking onto mine.

I ran.

I didn’t stop until I reached the bus station, my chest heaving and legs burning. I bought a ticket for the next bus out, not caring where it was headed.

As the bus pulled out of the station, I pressed my forehead against the window, trying to catch my breath. That’s when I saw it again: the photo, tucked into the seat pocket in front of me.

The same photo of the cabin.

But this time, everyone in the picture was smiling directly at me.",1,1733644816.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Did my first bow ties for the crack (but probably more to see if I could) and am really pleased with how they turned out, they were so simple once my head got around the logic.

Keep thinking I did the wrong side up. What is now the underside is the character side but less usable space, would have been more of an ornament than a table.

1h9dxed,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTheTraveler/comments/1h9dxed/what_to_do_on_a_sunday_in_los_angeles/,What to do on a Sunday in Los Angeles?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my experiences and recommendations for spending a perfect Sunday in Los Angeles. After living here for several years, I've discovered some amazing spots and activities that make weekends truly special.

First off, I always start my Sundays at the famous Farmers Market at The Grove. The smell of fresh pastries and coffee is absolutely incredible, and the atmosphere is super laid-back. It's perfect for people-watching and grabbing breakfast while planning the rest of your day.

If you're into nature, Griffith Park is a must-visit. I love hiking up to the Observatory early in the morning when it's not too hot. The views of the city are breathtaking, and sometimes you can even spot the Hollywood sign from certain trails. Pro tip: bring water and wear comfortable shoes!

For art lovers, LACMA offers free admission on the second Tuesday of each month. The Urban Light installation is perfect for those Instagram-worthy shots. Speaking of photos, Venice Beach Boardwalk on Sundays is absolutely buzzing with street performers, local artists, and the most interesting characters you'll ever meet.

Recently, I discovered this awesome website https://athometouch.com/losangeles that lists tons of unique activities and tours around LA. I've booked a few experiences through them, and they're fantastic for finding hidden gems that tourists usually miss.

If you're foodie like me, Grand Central Market downtown is paradise. The variety of food options is incredible - from Mexican to Japanese, they've got it all. I usually grab lunch there and then walk around the Arts District checking out the cool murals and boutique shops.

For afternoon activities, I highly recommend checking out some guided tours through https://athometouch.com/losangeles. They offer everything from food tours in Little Tokyo to Hollywood history walks. It's a great way to learn about the city while having fun.

As the day winds down, Sunset Boulevard comes alive with amazing restaurants and bars. My favorite spot is Mama Shelter's rooftop - the sunset views are unreal, and their cocktails are fantastic.

One thing I've learned about Los Angeles is that there's always something new to discover, even after years of living here. Whether you're into arts, food, nature, or just want to explore, this city has it all. Every Sunday can be a completely different adventure!

Just remember to check opening hours before heading out, as some places might have different Sunday schedules. Also, traffic can be unpredictable, so I always recommend planning ahead and maybe grouping activities by neighborhood.

What's your favorite way to spend Sundays in LA? I'd love to hear your suggestions in the comments!",1,1733644281.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

A natural choice for those situations seems to be the talkthru mode which is great quickly switch on and off, but there's a but: the mode seems to be muting media rather than pausing it. I suppose, when music is concerned, it's no big deal if you miss a part of a track while buying your take out coffee, but for a podcast it means I miss on a meaningful part of the text I'm listening to, so I would have to get my phone out and rewind to the point in time I turned talkthru on. Which is annoying as at that point in time I have the dog leash in one hand and my coffee in the other. So I end up manually pausing media and switching to ambient aware instead of using talkthru, which is an annoying series of taps on two earbuds in a sequence, also renders the smart talk feature useless. 
Thus, the question: is there a way to make talkthru pause media rather than mute it? ",1,1733644250.0,JBL,0,1.0,False

I'm a recent convert from the dark side of instant coffee. I've got my hands on some fresh, fine-ground coffee beans and am eager to explore new brewing methods.

I'm particularly interested in using my South Indian filter coffee maker and Moka pot to create milk-based coffees.

**Question 1: Filter Coffee Hack**

Can I add hot water and milk directly to the filter coffee maker during the initial extraction instead of plain water? Or would this compromise the flavor profile? (

**Question 2: Moka Pot Experiment**

Has anyone tried mixing milk and water in the Moka pot's bottom chamber? Would this produce a creamy, milky coffee, or would it clog the pot or affect the taste?

I'm open to any tips, tricks, or personal experiences. Thanks in advance for your insights!

I don't give a fuck about trying to achieve perfection or fad habits. What I care about is taking control of my life and taking full agency of my life through my actions. No more moping around, feeling sorry for myself or idling or inaction. I'm building momentum, small wins = upward spiral. Full responsibility for where I am and full responsibility for where I want to go. I refuse to continue being a feather in the fucking wind.  Fuck that.  See my day 0 here [https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1h7vdsc/day\_0\_of\_changing\_my\_lifei\_have\_hit\_rock\_bottom/](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1h7vdsc/day_0_of_changing_my_lifei_have_hit_rock_bottom/).

  
Here is all the things I completed today:

1. Morning sunlight ( took a walk today with family around a park, 10-20 mins)
2. Studying ( 2 hours in coffee shop )
3. Reading ( continued reading into chapter 2 of ""Can't hurt Me"" by David Goggin's).
4. Writing ( not a lot of writing today just this post but did write out my day tomorrow for more structure ) ✓
5. Exercise (walking + today was my lifting day - 1 hour workout then I bounced out the gym) ✓
6. Cold shower ( did 1-2 mins before I went to coffee shop )✓
7. Socialize ( saved some time at the end of my day today 8-11 pm to spend time with a friend watching ufc) ✓
8. Goal setting ( looked at my PowerPoint in the morning  and little bit here and there in my thoughts now that I'm not listening to music in the car-but honestly its not that much on my mind so need work on visualizing and thinking about my goals more since this itself will create a lot of momentum, especially when I actually ahcieve some of them or make progress towards them) ✓
9. Meditation (breathing practice right before I sleep - 10 mins - I do it while I'm already laying cuz it makes sense to me that way) ✓

Things I did not do today and I don't fucking accept as a part of my identity anymore:

~~1. Porn~~

~~2. Masturbate~~

~~3. Scroll~~

~~4. Random Media consumption~~

~~5. Random Reading~~

~~6. Music~~ 

~~7. Toxic Relationship~~

Since I've stopped using YouTube to just watch random videos, from my personal experience I can speak about how this has helped me although this won't apply to everybody. Growing up I struggled with the same problems of wanting to quit porn, and so I searched for help on the internet and searched up videos. But over time the algorithm picked this up and it started to recomend me more and more videos regarding self help. At this point a realization has come to me.  I'm so fucking sick of all the youtube videos that have catchy titles like "" do this to change your life"" and "" the one trick you need to do to change your life"" and ""why your life still sucks"" and ""why you lack self control"" and bla bla bla. That's what my homepage used to look like and I used to be a sucker for those videos- thinking one more video or one more thing I read is going to magically make me improve. Or better yet theres something that I don't know which is holding me back. FUCK THAT. All those videos even if they were well intentioned--- all of it ended up fillling up my homepage. And over years of watching that stuff and interacting with this enviroment that the algorithim created for me, all of that shit subconsiosuly cued to me over the years that I'm helpless, that I'm not in control of my life, that i'm just a fucking feather in the wind, that I dont know enough to make a change. AND I started to belive that shit cuz like everyone I struggled with bad habits. BUT FUCK tthat. I know exactly what I need to do and I'm done running around circles chasing information instead of taking action. and I will not allow bad habits to hold me back because I'm choosing to become absouletly relentless. I trust myself. I trust my plan, I trust my commitment to the plan, I'm gonna follow through with my plan , there is no other way around it. And I'm writing in this manner cuz I'm gonna drill into my head that I have what it takes, otherwise another voice in my head, the one with the dark thoughts, the one that doesnt think im good enogh, that one thats hopeless, the one that has no belief, the one who cowers away and cant take responsibiity, the one who wants to waste more time feeling sorry for his life, the one who wants to hide himself into smoke cuz hes so ashamed of himself, the one who thinks hes destined to failure cuz he failed out of univeristy, that voice, I fear it might take over, and I'm not letting it anymore .I'm challenging every belief I've developed over the years that I'm not in control of my life. I don't believe that shit anymore. That shit made me lazy when times were good and fall apart when times were bad. I don't control the wind but I sure as hell control my sails, cuz I'm the captain of my own fucking ship.  Anyways I'm finishing my meal right now and gonna head to bed  Gonna be up early cuz I wrote it down that I need to be up early, and that's it Ima be up early cuz I said so. Prolly not gonna feel like getting out of bed in the morning, but I dont care Ima get up anyways. Upward spiral.

But catastrophic to humanity? If the realities of disclosure were THAT dire, wouldn't we see more NDAs being broken?

For the sake of argument/example let's talk extremes...

If we were all about to be enslaved and used for food... who gives a flying shit about your agreement to keep quiet? You owe it to your common species to let people know.

If we were about to be literally INVADED by ALIENS. and city sized craft will soon park over cities... don't you think more people would be saying ""fuck it I'm talking""?

***Nobody out there with the real info has had a Snowden moment where they realized withholding the information was not only wrong, but dangerous, and potentially treasonous to the human race?***



You get what I mean here? If they really ""know"" what's coming, then it can't be THAT bad otherwise people would be talking. I have a hard time believing the whole industry is filled with hard ass purists looking down the barrel of a gun and watching a clock count down while also just keeping quiet because they signed a piece of paper.

Obviously... there have been ""whistleblowers""... and many get swept under the rug... but many have been loooong retired and get up to cooky woo in the garage and their cred is quickly annihilated. And the stories are frankly ALL OVER THE PLACE. There are lot of theories, built on other theories, that are then built and structured again. Like a giant house of cards and foundation is nothing but Jokers. All these fantastic quotes from powerful players are getting up there in age.

I'm talking legit, first hand experience, in the know, NON-retired personnel with a conscience and the media to back ALL of it up.  ***Not a guy that was in the system and heard stories*** and not grainy ass low res flir footage... I'm talking OPIR footage of the 400 meter craft hiding in the clouds referenced in the Immaculate Constellation document.

Maybe the secrecy is a silver lining. Maybe I'm just hoping we're not about to enter a new dark age while people in the know sit back with ""their hands tied""

Unless of course, it's ""nothing more"" than some reverse engineered tech that could get some military feathers ruffled.

I'm not trying to be flippant with anything here... I'm not advocating people break agreements just willy nilly. I just feel like if the shit were really about to hit the fan in a way that's REALLY going to turn our world upside down... someone out there with undeniable credentials would be spilling the beans and not zip up when the hard questions get pressed.

I see Nancy Mace going into SCIFs and selling TShirts. I mean WTF. Is something legit coming or do you guys just have some fancy metal buried 20 stories underground?

I know I know... years and years of systemic oppression and people mysteriously dying and all that jazz. But it's 2024. And the spearheads are going along with the 2027 rhetoric. (Lue told that dude at a conference 2027. Randall Nickerson was told to wait on a documentary for a few years. etc, etc, whether the genesis of this date was G Ramirez or someone else I dunno)

1h9dqvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioware/comments/1h9dqvg/architectural_approach_violation_and_consequences/,Architectural approach: violation and consequences,"# Introduction 

I will note at the very beginning that what I write is my personal opinion, supplemented with best practices.English is not my native language, so I apologize in advance for the nuances that may be perceived differently there.

\[Warning: DAV Spoilers\]

I am professionally engaged in software and business process architecture. My hobbies, my passion are dramaturgy (I use it for TTRPG) and psychology. In fact, this is the architecture of human personalities and behavior. 

I love all the 3 parts of Dragon Age series: Origins, II, and Inquisition. These are the games that led me to my hobbies, influenced the formation of my personality. The architecture of their characters and plots could always be discussed for a long time, and even after hours you as a player find some more food for thought.

\*\*\* 

I have nothing against experiments in each new game: developers should have a certain creative freedom and the right to make mistakes. But any game with each new part forms and complements the architectural approach - the basic principles that should not be violated. 

Managers running development should write these principles down and refer to them before every management decision to ensure the product is successful. I will also tie them to the ITSM guidelines, which work in a similar way.

Gamedev is a young sphere with (generally) low-maturity business processes, and I usually work with large enterprises, so I don't know if Bioware is using these principles. If they aren't, and it helps with future games, I'll be happy (we all know the team reads Reddit). If they are, then maybe it makes sense to focus on the aspects of their implementation, since violations are visible even to people who are not involved in the development process. 

Note: this criticism applies to narrative design, writing, dialogue, music, character content, in-game scenes, and communication with the audience. Outside the scope is level design, art, gameplay and technical optimization of the game: I suppose teams working on these areas provide high-quality results.

\*\*\* 

Each Dragon Age game has more and less important components (for the audience). Team can freely experiment with the least important ones in the series: perhaps someone will be unhappy, but we, the players, will accept changes in gameplay, character classes, approach to building levels or changes in the style (eg, realism vs stylization). The main components are what should be recorded as commandments, so that each team member who wants to violate them immediately slaps hands with this codex. The main principle is **Focus on value.**

# 1. Story and immersion

This is the most important thing in the game. For example, Inquisition had minor plot flaws and a questionable ending with Corypheus (as well as Baldur's Gate III, for example, although I love it), but the rest of the game's content and a beautiful epilogue make it a beautiful work  of art, and I still keep an eye on other works by its talented creators.

* RPG is a genre that already exists and works, and the audience is here for it. **Keep it simple and practical.** Just leave it as is. In this game, the team decided not to tell a story, as before, but to impose their own views and “toxic positivity” on the players. Moralizing monologue has always been considered a bad technique in dramaturgy, naturally causing a defensive reaction - therefore it is usually used in low-quality films for propaganda - or works of very new authors. In dialogues, I did not get options to express my own opinion or play the character in a certain way. I felt like I was being shut up, imposed on me by lines that solve nothing and express nothing. Game forbids me to have my own opinion, choose my behavior, or make decisions. The fact that this was established as the main strategy in RPG is an absolutely disastrous decision at the management level. It is better to give fewer options for lines than to do so and think players will accept it. The scene with push-ups caused a scandal not because people cannot accept non-binary persons, but because of the imposition and hypocrisy that it delivered in the subtext.
* Simplification should not be excessive. Players are not idiots, and disposable gum is an unprofitable investment in the long term. Endless repetition of the names Elgar'nan and Ghilan'nain, or a frontal letter explaining what we just saw is a direct insult to the intelligence of the product's consumers. People who do not want to delve into the plot so much are not your target audience, and you have most likely already lost yours.
* Immersion is formed by many details, and in order to punch fewer holes, you need to be careful about maintaining balance. If you punch a hole, fill it with good content, but try to punch as little as possible. Alistair's modernized lexicon does not cause negativity, but Taash's ultra-modern terminology did not please many. In a situation of lack of time and an apocalypse, there should be no book clubs and picnics in Ferelden, which is dying from the Blight.
* The main character is the player's avatar. Making him a shoulder to cry on instead of a person is a huge mistake. Add to that the ignoring of their needs and poorly done romances, and you get a complete lack of a channel for emotional relationship to the game.
* You also need to be very careful with retcons: changing Flemeth's visual appearance made her incredibly cool, so as a player I am okay with this, but the retcon of the scene of her murder and Solas' motivation, as well as the meaningless secret ending - this is very clumsy. The transition from state A to state B must be explained - in such a way that players will ""buy"" that.
* Rook’s backstory is illogical and meaningless (I've heard that bit better with the Grey Wardens). Dalish or city elf have no credible personal connections, no credible biography that we can see. The lack of a prologue didn't add any dynamism: we simply don't know who our protagonist is, and we don't believe in his friendship and apprenticeship with Varric, or Varric's sudden friendship with Solas that came out of nowhere. The prologue is an introduction to the characters. As a writer, you have to ""sell"" to players the plot and the ensemble of characters in the prologue. 
* Absolutely no ""nuking"", killing off important characters, or significantly changing the world off-screen! If you have to do that, you need highlights about it on-screen. Show, don't tell: we believe in what we see most, and less in what other characters tell us, and only then do the Codex entries and in-game notes come. Putting important information exclusively in the Codex and third-party sources is a mistake that impoverishes the content and overall impression. An even bigger mistake is to tell it only in interviews.
* The story needs to tie together the choices in previous games, because that's what gives it depth. **Start where you are.** No one exists in a vacuum. Ignoring world states was a huge mistake, and it's worth acknowledging openly. You can cut out less important choices, make some canon if done well (like Laidlaw keeping Leliana alive so we get the super cool version of her in DAI), or swap out one character for another (Neve or Bellara sacrificing themselves with a cool line, and it works fine… until they survive with a full cure). Let's be honest: Inquisition has an open ending, and before changing or resetting anything, the team needed to release a game that would close the major plot arcs.
* If a significant story arc is revealed through a companion arc, you need to be extremely careful about it: be clear about what players want to get - and what they need to get now. If you can't do that in the current game, prepare the way to the next one and take a break. Harding/titans arc setup had me holding my breath as a “Descent” fan, but the ending is for five year olds. Give me a few hints, like: the Kal-Sharok dwarves seem like nice guys, but in the corner by the secret door is a bloody smear that gets quickly wiped away, on the desk is a document about the purchase of a batch of slaves... In the next game, we can reveal that they are supplying living beings for the Architect, having made a deal with the intelligent darkspawn who create the broodmothers to become the new race of Thedas instead of humans, elves, and dwarves. Something like this. Some steps to good story structure.
* The author must understand the flow of the game in order to put decision checkpoints where it emotionally matters to the player. The player must natively understand the number and structure of acts, as well as what act they are in and where the points of no return will be. In this regard, the game is a Mess Effect: there is no prologue, no basis for the choices formed before them, and the endings, well-designed for action game, do not withstand the simplest challenge from a narrative point of view. When we are not related emotionally to either Treviso or Minrathous, a sudden choice shows only the importance of strategy or emotions for the player (or cafe interiors versus port warehouses). Neither one nor the other gives anything to the plot. The fact that you can trick the God of Deception by slipping him a replica of his own artifact from Ebay is problematic. The fact that the main character did not put any effort into this is doubly problematic.
* Politics, religion, racial inequality are aspects that form a realistic picture of the world. The attitude of companions to them gives them depth and forms a personality. Cassandra and Solas can discuss this for hours, having a lot of material and opinions. Put Davrin and Bellara in the same scene, and they smile and nod at each other because they have nothing to discuss and nothing to argue about. The world has lost its colors, and so have the companions and the protagonist.
* A writer cannot give what they do not have. If you have only ever trained a lap dog - not a wild beast; have never known war, despair or hunger, and your only problem is that they brought you a smoothie that was too cold, you will not be able to jump above your head. Christopher Lee knew what it sounded like to die from a dagger. Tolkien knew what it was like to lose friends in war. If a team of writers does not know how to write a romantic arc or what the reaction to war is, they should either refresh the team or hire consultants.

# 2. Characters and dialogues

We learn about the world through characters, so this is an incredibly important aspect. Veilgard failed in this (except for Emmrich and, partially, Davrin). What should be in the all games of the series:

* In conversations with companions, players learn about the world and form their attitude towards it, accepting or rejecting the opinion of the companion. But if the companion is not a person and has no opinion, we don’t care about this world and all the work done: it’s a cardboard decoration that we don’t believe in. The reactions of the characters must be written taking into account their personalities, history, views! “Oh, our ancient gods are trying to destroy the world, oh, well, okay” tears the personality out of Bellara. Replace it with Merrill, who at this moment is torn apart by an internal conflict, should she fight against the Evanuris or bow down and get the treasured ancient knowledge? The story begins to play and shimmer with colors. No reactions - no personality, and no immersion for the player. In the case of the Evanuris, there is no distance between them and their followers (Elgar'nan's correspondence is lying around everywhere), no awe of them, no suspense that was in Horror of Hormak.
* Conversations with a companion that allow you to get to know them and the world are the basis of Dragon Age. This is what we love the game for, and what we crave when we open it. Replacing it with the movement of companion models around the base is a cruel and problematic decision. I felt that the world was gaining colours only twice: when Harding recalled the Inquisition, and when talking to Morrigan at the Crossroads. The rest of the time, I waited for ""live"" dialogues, which never happened.
* The motivation of the characters must be clear! Taash died for me as a companion because of the combination of ""The Qun, whom I and you do not obey, demands / I do not want to go with you - later - I wanted to go with you then / Rook supports them, despite the hypocrisy and lies"". When romancing Nev, instead of romance, Rook shows harassment and violation of personal boundaries, because Neve does not know and cannot tell clearly what she wants at all. No, ""it's a big threat, so everyone just follows the leader"" is unrealistic, and therefore does not work. And no, instead of motivation you can't give the antagonist ""he just wants power and money"" pseudo-motivation - it's dummy and causes rejection. Relationships between characters are strengthened when they go through a conflict together. No conflict - no strength. No personality - no rapprochement. Codex entries that characters spend time together do not equal real dynamics.
* OOC should be avoided as it breaks immersion. If Catarina executed Illario with her own hands, it would show her as worthy of the title of First Talon. Soft granny with a grandson under house arrest is not a Raven, just a hen with its claws torn out. The fact that Lucanis agrees with this decision shows him just as soft and unworthy. The fact that the entire party doesn't know the word ""Amatus"" makes them idiots: we in the real world usually know such words from popular languages. Broken and boring Dorian (my friend, my amatus!), who can't move through one room before the Inquisitor, or the hypocritical Isabela, who has no personality, no career path, and no ship. Incredible Morrigan and Flemeth (really strong female characters, by the way!), relegated to Solas' exposition. Mythal, goddess who was so revered in previous games, as unremarkable generic elf\_model\_05. Varric - everyone's favorite character turned accessory. The personalities of existing characters cannot be changed and retconned like that, and it is the worst way to show them - the lack of a development arc for everyone.
* Prioritize, then spend resources. A routine dog walk in the woods will not reveal the character. In a situation of lack of time, you need to take only those parts of his story that are important for the current plot - at least 1 for each facet of his personality. If a part of the story does not contribute anything to the plot and characters, it needs to be cut. Lords of Fortune with their miserable arena for 10 identical fights and a code of honor (good luck surviving on the income from the junk collected on the beaches, guys), as well as the Veil Jumpers who appeared out of nowhere and broke the lore and visual design patterns - this is meaningless and alien content that wasted resources. If there are very few resources for the game, cut content in favor of quality. **Progress iteratively with feedback.** Make one cool game for 20-30 hours, collect and process feedback. And then make another one. The smaller the product, the easier it is to manage, the better the time to market. Optimize and automate. Put production on a conveyor belt. We, the players, will buy everything, and then give it away to our friends. (The public offer is only valid for the game of 1-3 parts quality, not Veilguard quality :D)
* Characters should have character facets: the protagonist - as many as possible (since we are not in the prose genre, there are fewer options), companions - at least 3-5 two-part facets, NPCs - well, up to 3. Characterization is not equal to character: character is revealed through choices under pressure, in conflict. Choices should be between equally significant things. I don't care how much coffee Lucanis drinks or what shaving gel he uses: the only choice he makes is to weakly feign romantic interest in the protagonist or go away to be sad about his city. This is too little. Solas has more facets than the protagonist and companions, and this creates an imbalance in the players' attitude towards him. (I will not analyze the character facets here, otherwise the post is already getting long)
* The number of facets should offer a wide spotlight on the character's development. As a TTRPG player, I first come up with a facet, and then with a case that results in a choice. Ideally, one scene works for several characters, so that everyone has enough time. If there is not enough screen time for development, the player simply will not believe what is happening.
* The subtext is handled so poorly that I want to cry into a Robert McKee volume. There is no subtext, and it leaves the character and world flat. How could this happen - that even the most basic principles of dramaturgy were ignored in the development of a AAA product? What happened? I have no answer.
* Romances should have an arc and ""special"" scenes. The setting of the scene should connect the stories and personalities of the characters in the frame, each romance should have conflicts and several ""touches"" - scenes and lines that develop it. It is always a challenge, always an answer to the question ""why are they are together? what will they have to overcome? why are these characters special to each other?""
* It's better to write lines in battle as meaningful and use them less often. When Emmrich, as a professor, praises Rook, it looks organic. When others do it all the time, and it's mixed with banters, it looks like sycophancy. Banters themselves lose their meaning without mutual ribbing, and lines like ""I get it"", ""ah, now I see"", ""ah, so that's what you are"" should be banned altogether: it's a lazy patch, which we guys see very well.

# 3. Audience interaction

Dev team reminds us that characters are not real, unlike developers, so it is worth caring about the feelings of developers. And, in general, I agree - authors often receive a lot of hate, and this is probably a very difficult experience. But, as in any relationship, it is necessary to build relationships from both sides, not from one.

The arc of relationships is built in several touches - both in the plot and in reality. Some touches - before the release of the game, the release and the game itself - one big touch, and then - touches in the form of interviews and answers to questions. Depending on what kind of touch it is, you will get a plus or minus to the attitude / trust of the audience.

The human brain does not know the difference between real emotions and emotions caused by a work of art. When we immerse ourselves in a game, we open up and become emotionally vulnerable: this is what allows us to feel emotions brightly. Especially at the moments of plot denouements, romantic arcs and endings. Therefore, if the author at this point is careless about the player's feelings, or even intentionally hits them, this causes a sharp negative reaction. In simple words: you opened your soul, and they shit in it. Anger and disappointment are the logical result. Transparency builds trust, but lies kill that. **Collaborate and promote visibility** is a principle that teaches: trust must be built with the help of transparency.

* You as a studio show off some great visual concepts. (Matt and the art team are incredible) +
* You release great books and comics. While Fenris looks like he never went through an arc with Hawke, the new companions are intriguing and the hint of spy games in Tevinter is exciting +
* You release an empty cartoon series in terms of plot and characters. -
* You release a trailer where Solas and Varric have a stupid and empty dialogue without any subtext: players start to fear that all the writing will be like this, but they don’t lose hope. Perhaps this is an isolated case, a marketing mistake: after all, the writers are led by an experienced writer, Weeks. -
* The scene with push-ups flew around the Internet. Players understand that no, this is not an isolated case. -
* You promise the best romances and release the worst ones with the empty scenes. -
* You talk about how the game focuses on companions, but companions have no facets and depth, and the player feels superfluous through the main character. -
* You pay magazines for fake reviews about ""returning to true form"" so that after the release, players will find out that they were deceived without the possibility of a refund more than 2 hours later. -
* In a recent AMA session, we saw that the creative director of the game could not name the main principles of the development of the games of the series when fans asked him about it. If it is a misunderstanding of these principles, it is reasonable to question the manager's professionalism. If it is an evasion of the answer, so as not to speak openly about the fact that they were violated, this is a few more lost points of trust. -

There are so many - too many minuses. After the release, a large part of the audience lost trust in the studio, the team, and the franchise, since the basic principles and expectations were violated. When communicating with the audience, previous violations must be taken into account. Is there really not a single PR specialist in the studio who could explain this to managers?

If you are sick, it is better to reschedule the AMA than to make a bad situation even worse, and then try to press on pity. If you do not know your own lore, it is better not to go alone, but to take one of the writers with you as a consultant. All these situations that caused a sharply negative reaction were resolved very easily, in fact. You need to be careful and treat the players and the game carefully and with love, and not as carelessly as it turned out in the end. Or entrust public relations to someone who can handle it.

I would like the players and the studio to build a relationship on mutual value, but this is impossible to do without managers who LISTEN to the players, and a good game that confirms these intentions. If development hell is preventing you from doing everything right, maybe you should start a union or something before development. People's eyes should light up, a burned out team can't produce anything of quality.

The marketing campaign gave away all the secrets that the plot was supposed to reveal - right away and clumsily. I would have happily played Dread Wolf even with spoilers, because I would have been interested in finding out how it all happened, but here? Management needs to tell marketing how to present information in a way that will hook players. Ghilan'nain attacking Weisshaupt? Just show a big glowing face, but in a way that we don't understand where it is.

Additional content in books and comics needs to be presented in small highlights in the game. Leaving it all in third-party sources is a bad option, it doesn't work. Players don't care about Felassan, whom they don't know: at least you could have shown significant moments of his history with Solas in a slideshow, including the murder and regrets about it. Same with Isseia - she was great in the book, and I love her, but in the game she's a cardboard villain.

And yes. Representation is great, if the developers decided to highlight MTF - I have nothing against it. But I would like to see the needs of other groups not infringed upon in favor of one group. I can sadly accept that the character's secondary sexual characters are too small, and the representation of women suffers - okay, screw it. But the fact that all women are forced to wear the same outfit, because only it shows breast? The fact that there is not a single light robe for us that emphasizes the figure, and all the armor options are bulky and with a bunch of unnecessary details? How can you not understand, being a member of the dev team, that this, coupled with the note ""I feel uncomfortable around women because they are more feminine than me"" forms a certain subtext that infringes on women's rights? Very progressive. In the next games, it is worth allocating a week of work for the designer on at least 5 outfits for women. Ideally, conduct a survey among the players, which types of outfits they liked or did not like, what is missing. Diversity is about the diversity of opinions, and for some reason the game has problems with it. In general, all that is needed is to listen and hear the consumers of content. And then speak - on an equal footing.

# 4. Musical accompaniment

Music in a computer game is a story within a story. It should play on the heart strings and reflect what we see in the world and in the characters. **Think and work holistically**: all aspects that form a product should be intertwined and reflect each other. 

Inon Zur, Trevor Morris - these are composers whose music complements the game, causing goosebumps. Hans Zimmer is a composer who lazily threw in generic music, without delving into what and why he writes.

The musical part in the game gives the same subtext as writing: we are too lazy to bother, and say be thankful that the game came out at all. Solavellan Ending is largely chosen because it is emotionally filled, unlike the others. And a large part of this is Trevor Morris's music. Although I like the ""bad"" ending the most: at least in it Rook shows character for the second time (1st for the First Warden).

# Summary

I'm the voice of the voiceless - people without dialogue options...

Well, I'm just joking. I don't really hope that the words of a no-name from the Internet will reach Bioware or EA, but what if?

I'm writing this to express my emotions, structure my thoughts - and share them with my friends and other nerds who are not too lazy to read this long text. Behind me stands a Knight-Commander Meredith mannequin - making sure that text is godly enough.

Horror and valor, ancient secrets and new challenges. Dragon Age has been my love for many years. It gave me incredible friends, long hours of discussing theories, a spark for creativity.

Now I feel a clear line that separates ""before"" and ""after"". I still love the previous parts, but I will never love things like Veilgard or Andromeda. This is something that doesn't evoke an emotional connection in me, something that fades from memory almost instantly.

I think many players feel the same way now. We have to challenge ourselves before buying a Bioware game and think ten times whether to buy it or not. The new Mass Effect will inherit these problems. And, at least, pay attention to the number of sales, if you don't care about us.

Let's face it: trust is lost, and the leadership strategy needs to be completely changed.

And if the Bioware studio openly admits this and publishes a plan for handling failures and making improvements, then, maybe, not all is lost.",0,1733643472.0,bioware,0,0.4,False

Prague Eternal Weekend Pioneer mainevent,"Hello, riding a train to modern mainevent EW and decided to quickly share my unusual experience at last (and first) big pioneer event in my area this year. 

I did not played pioneer almost whole year except webcam testing Dimir Ninjas with my friend. Kaito was fun, but I was not confident enough with the build so decided to join [the dark side.](https://imgur.com/a/DWPAl79)

The site at PVA EXPO Letňany was different than TOP Hotel last year, but easier to access.
The tourney started however *quite* unusual. You were registered before through Companion which later crashed and had to be after like 30-45 mins redone manually from the first round in Melee. To my knowledge there were 69 players registered with top8.

Before the crash some wierd thing happenned:

1. Round - Opponent did not arrive, 1-0-0: It is the first round, can happen. My friend had the same, can happen it is second advent weekend.

2. Round - Opponent did not arrive, 2-0-0: WELL, that is strange app crashed and the redo happenned

3. Round - Jund Sacrifice, 3-0-0: After almost 3 hours of waiting I could finally play. First game I didn't really know what to expect, but my Trespassers proved useful. Second game I was stomped by value and killed by reanimating Ygra with Scavenger Talent. Third game I just had Torches and Removal and opponent was lower on lands. However I had to kill him in last extended turn because we were in stalemate with my demon Kikijiki and Annex and his bunch of creatures and potional to combo. The exile package in the build proved to be useful as expected and managed to push through the combos and were able to attack and win.

4. Round - Izzet Phoenix, 4-0-0: I don't remember much, but I lost the first game by a tiny bit, second won pretty well and last was till the last drop of blood. I had Annex, attacking with 2 Mutavaults, oppo raced me back with Borrower and Picklock. I managed to kill him exactly 

5. Round - Dimir Ninjas with Annexes, 5-0-0: This was pretty quick. First game I stomped him, Second t3 Kaito and I could not catch up. Third game oppo was little lower on lands and even tho the game was very tight as I began killing myself with the Annex afterr Unsummoning my demon, when my Invokes Despair arrived it was sealed.

6. Round - Rakdos Prowess, 5-0-1: I ID with my friend and went for lunch

7. Round - Bant Angels, 5:0:2: Me and my friend were 2. and 1., top8 was secured, angels wanted to id, we went for a coffee.

Top8 to my knowledge was: 2 Prowess 1 Phoenix (from earlier), 1 Jund Sacc, 2 Rakdos Midrange, 1 Bant Angels and 1 Dimir Ninjas

Quaterfinals - Rakdos Prowess: I was thinking that the game could be good with me starting, having Anoints and Torches. First game I quickly stomped not much to say. Second I did TERRIBLE sideboarding. For some reason I decided to keep Durress in main and not siding Extinction event. My opening hand was some removal I think Trespasser and 4 lands with Mutavault, decided to keep and started to top deck all 3 Duresses and a lot lands.
Last game I had hand Harvester, Dreams, Mutavault, Haunted Ridge, Swamp, Trespasser, Anoint. I decided to keep and chose the way for t1 Dreams which led to oppo showing me 2 lands 2 Kumano 1 Slickshot 1 HeartfireHero and something - Exiling hero. Then I exiled something with Anoint, but could not exile any creature with trespasser later on. I got to race situation where I had Flipped kikjiki and 2 trespassers but still nothing to exile. Oppo had 2 slickshots and Claim/Fame  I eventually had to sacc kikijiki to bargained torch to kill one slickshot and could eventually lost to an attack with hasted hero and slickshot.

Overall I had fun, but keep asking if the game cpuld went differently if I had gone for the Harvester with tapped ridge t1 (would have somthing to bargain for torch other than kikijiki and could swing with 3 trespassers).

My friend later played against this guy in mirror Rakdos Prowess and won the entire tourney earning along tixes Griselbrand big card.

Overall happy with the results, 700 tix grabbed singles Abbhorrent Oculus, traded some tix for Annex and still 400 left (20=1pack)but did not like the 3 hour wait at the beginning. Need to run for modern. May later fill more details.

This device is incredibly flexible. I can use it as a tablet for browsing the web, a laptop for work tasks, or even as a sketchpad for drawing and taking notes. Everything runs smoothly, which is great considering how light and thin it is. It’s nice to have one device that can do so many things.

Of course, it’s not perfect. There are definitely times when a traditional laptop would be a better choice for specific tasks, especially for heavy-duty work like video editing or programming. However, the iPad Pro really shines in its ability to adapt to different situations. Whether I'm working on a document, watching a movie, or sketching out ideas, it handles everything well.

I chose the 11-inch model because it fits my needs perfectly. I find that a larger screen would be a bit cumbersome, especially when I want to relax on the couch and read. The smaller size makes it easy to carry around, and I can easily slip it into my bag when I’m on the go. Sometimes I think a bigger screen might be nice, but I haven't really needed it for what I do daily.

I also started using a reading app for magazines and news articles, and it’s been a pleasant surprise. I enjoy catching up on the latest news in the morning while I sip my coffee. The layout is clean and easy to navigate, which makes reading more enjoyable.

The Apple Pencil has been a fantastic addition as well. I love using it for drawing and taking notes. The gesture feature has turned out to be really useful, too; it makes the whole experience feel more intuitive.

One of the best aspects is how well it syncs with my iPhone. Everything works together seamlessly in the Apple ecosystem. I can easily share files, use apps across devices, and receive notifications without any hassle. It really enhances my overall experience.

Even though the M4 chip might seem like overkill for a tablet, it gives me peace of mind knowing that it can handle anything I need. I feel confident that this device will stay relevant and receive updates for a long time.

Overall, I’m really happy with this device. It meets my needs in so many ways and has made my daily tasks easier and more enjoyable. I can see myself using it for a long time to come!",4,1733643225.0,ipad,1,0.75,False

So we are going to buy our first ever coffee machine and after a lot of researchs, i ended with too choices Bambino or Bambino plus. I know the main difference is the automatic milk steam but at what cost ? knowing that with Cyber Monday solds  The Bambino is $349.98 and the Bambino plus is 489.99$ (Canadian dollar), is the price's difference worth it ? 

we Love Cappuccino, Lattes, Flat white but i don't know if its still easy to make it easily in the bambino, or is it better to invest on the bambino plus for better confort ?

Advice?,"OK so my best friend (27f) and me (43m) have been close for over 4 years. We work together and she insists she just wants to be ""friends"" and is not into me like that. I think it is because I am older and am in a relationship. I have felt for some time she really likes me in ways that extend beyond friendship. My s/o knows about our friendship and at times teases me about her being my girlfriend or ""work wife"". I just wish she could tell me how she really feels.

So yesterday I was at work and she was off. I was kinda missing her being there because honestly it's my buddy and am working with a bunch of guys who just want to talk about playing video games and ""banging girls"" (their words not mine). Well towards the later part of my shift I was talking to the young lady in my department about health issue she has and I told her that my best friend has the same issues. I don't but look up and see her at the door waving at me as she stands there waiting for me to come out. I go on the floor and she is nothing but smiles and despite it being really cold out she is wearing a very tight long sleeved shirt (and she is always cold) she said she needed to pick up some stuff before she goes out shopping. We talk for a few minutes and I am about to let her go. She keeps following me around and making small talk about anything and everything. We work together 4-5 days a week for the past 4 years but she is acting ""funny"". Well one of the things we do is take turns getting coffee in the morning. My s/o knows so it is not a secret I am keeping from her. Anyways when I last worked with her on friday she was teasing me about getting her coffee (pretty normal) and I said we don't work together until Tuesday so I could get something then. So yesterday she asked me if I was still going to get her coffee tomorrow? I laugh and she pouts at me and goes ""you told me you were going to"".

OK SO I SAVED THIS POST ON MONDAY NIGHT BUT THEN THIS HAPPENS...

Tuesday I bring her coffee in and things go normal as usual. We take our break together and she opens up about her childhood dog dying last month it was tragic (she had him since she was 10 as a 8 week old puppy). When I found out I got her a card about grieving and knowing from my past that my childhood dog was put down on my birthday. This is something we have bonded as friends for years. I told her I am always here if she wants to talk about it and I will never judge her for it. This is not abnormal we have both through the years been there for each other in tough situations that sometimes others may not understand or relate to. She seems emotional and she has some health issues and frankly it was stuff that I relate well with as my mom and my aunt dealt with the same issue. I even came home and talked to my s/o (39f) about it. She gives me some advice if you are comfortable talking about it that is fine. My bestie was telling me about how bad her body was aching (her period, side effects of her new prescription and her anemia) and such and I came to get her for her break and she decided to work through it. I kinda scolded her about it and felt bad so I went up to her after the break and was like I was just trying to help you and I thought she was upset at me for speaking up to her. She just smiled and joked with me and was like ""I know you were just trying to help me but I only have a half hour to get it all (work) done"". We carried on our day.

So now Weds (12/4) I go into work and she is having bad leg pain. She said she has a muscle relaxer for it but wanted to wait until after her first break. NOTE: When I had oral surgery in October she gave me one b/c she was worried about me not having adequate medicine as they tried to give her 800mg motrin for her   and that was all. I ended up taking it after my surgery and it knocked me out in 20 minutes. Well her pain was getting bad and I had bought 2 breakfast sandwiches (b1g1 for a $1). So I was in the office next to her and we were talking and I told her that I got an extra sandwich she could have so she doesn't take her pill on an open stomach. She takes it at the beginning of her break and within 10 minutes she is acting ""funny"" I tell her I will keep an eye on her even though we work in different departments they are among each other. She kept finding a way to see me and was acting really silly. So she was moving carts so I stopped my work (which had been done for some time I was just maintaining) to make sure she got her cart to the proper place and didn't crash. She then keeps trying to get me to work with her and to be fair we worked together in a department which I am in for about 2 1/2 years prior to her leaving the store for a few months before returning. Anyways I made it a point to keep an eye on her. Well towards the end of my shift she starts talking to me about ""do you like my hair?"", ""on a scale of 1 to 10 what do you think about me as far as personality?"" ""personality is the number 1 thing for me and always has been"" (and she has always said this when I have criticized some of the guys she has talked to/dated and they don't work out). She then tells me the guy she supposedly likes ""has an grumpy personality and is OK but you \*\*\*\* have a 5 out of 10 personality"". No you don't you are ten out of ten, \*\*\*\*. Definitely a 10"". Then she asks me point blank ""How's my personality?"" I tell her that your personality is why we click so well as friends. She then asks me about another girl who works there: ""How pretty is \*\*\*\* (another girl)?"" I laugh and we both say 3 out of ten at the same second. Then she asked me how pretty am I on a 1 to 10 scale. I teased her about her hair was all messy in a bun but she looked adorable. So I laugh and tell her ""your hair makes you a 9 1/2 today"". This is towards the end of the shift.

The next day Thurs (12/5) I am in an hour earlier than her so I see her and we talk a little bit. She stops me before my break and tells me about this restaurant and what she likes there how good it is and I should try it. This is common we always share different things we like. I mean a lot of days I ask her where I should eat in between my 2 jobs so this is not out of the ordinary. Perhaps her enthusiasm for me trying it. So yesterday (Fri 12/6) on my break from my other job I tried what she recommended and it was really good. Well I was excited to tell her I tried it.

Today (12/7) was a whirlwind of emotions. She gets there and we talk pretty similar to most days. Everything seems OK I mentioned in conversation that I tried the place and got what she recommended and the same way and it was great. She added and it is ""cheap too"". I agree and things are fine. Suddenly she seems a little ""off"" and she has done this a time or two over the past few years. She just suddenly was kind of ""short"" with me and not laughing at my jokes which she is the person that will laugh at a joke of mine that is not even funny or just an ""inside joke"" between us.

Let me add she had a boyfriend/fiance for a little over a year (Mar 2023 to Aug 2024). We remained friends even though there was a gap where she got another job but even then she was trying to get me a job with her. He was very abusive in certain ways. He didn't work for good portions of the relationship and when he did get a job he wouldn't help her with bills or frankly anything with her apartment. I several times threw her 20 bucks because I knew she needed it and she has been a good friend and helped me in the past in situations and some she might not even realize how much she helped me. This is why I love her like family and I would do anything for my best friend and all she needs to do is ask. She was there in my awful 2021 as a friend when I needed someone to help me through. So we kinda had a falling out over her boyfriend in the spring. He was upsetting her and she opened up to me a lot but not entirely and I did not approve of her relationship with him but I let her work it out. She was officially in the process of breaking up with him and I talked her through it.

Then with her awkwardness this morning my manager confronted me about her. She saw how it was. My manager 38f and I had a ongoing discussion for about 45 minutes about my best friend 27f. She asked me if I wanted her opinion on the whole thing. I said I would like that. She said you might not want to hear it but she has a definite opinion and is based on being a woman herself. I said go ahead. My manager told me: That my best friend likes me. That she likes me in a way that far exceeds ""just being friends"". She told me that she really likes you and that it is way beyond that and that she loves you and is most likely very much in love with me. She said my best friend has never admitted it to her but being a woman herself and having a sister and friends who are women and this is how they would act if/when they are in love. She apologized if this bothers me or hurts me but it is her opinion. I just told her I appreciated her opinion and frankly confirmed thoughts I have had about her here and there but really in the last week and a half. My manager added that my best friend knows I am in a long term relationship and I am 16 years older than her.  That has been an excuse before when asked if she likes me and it is something like ""\*\*\*\* (me) and like her dad's age and she couldn't like me like that"". I have been looking at everything through a microscope as far as conversations and comments.

As the day passed my best friend would come by and joke with me but then a minute later be cold and distant when we talked. I wish she could just be open with me about it. She even alluded to my on Tues (12/3) that she wouldn't tell me if something happened with this guy she supposedly likes. I said ""Of course you will as you tell me everything."" She looks at me getting red in the face playing with her hair ""You would be surprised there are a few things that I haven't told you"" then smiles real big and walks away ""and I can't""

On November 5th my best friend lost her childhood pet who was nearly 17 years old. I was on vacation that week. Knowing her she always told me how important he was to her. I lost my childhood pet on my birthday because my stepmom put him down on that day. Her story is sad and it took her a few weeks to open up completely. Her dog collapsed in the backyard when she was at her mom's. Her Mom and stepdad got her and she told me the details of how her 27 year old woman crumbled on the ground crying and yelling out trying to wake him but he was already hardened within minutes she said. She cried so much it was getting all over her dogs hair. She also felt bad because her dog had stayed at her mom's for the past 2 1/2 years because her landlord wouldn't allow him but in the last year or so it would have been difficult to get up the stairs to go out to the bathroom. She lived very close to her Mom's and visited all the time and during the ending days of her past relationship she stayed at her Mom's to avoid her then boyfriend/fiance but also to spend time with her ""Buddy"" and that is/was his name. Before I knew the personal details of is passing I knew regardless she would be broken by it. I got her a card about losing him and added that I am here to talk, to cry, to yell and even laugh and also included a $15 starbucks card because Coffee is our language and I know that brings her happiness. I look back at that and think perhaps I shouldn't have done that but she is my best friend, I knew this was tough on her, and I care deeply for her well-being. Like I said this was before I got the details of his passing but I didn't need details to know that as her truest, genuine friend she needed me in this time and there was nothing I wouldn't do to help ease her pain.

I have been going through a lot of emotions in regards to her over the past week or so but today it was that on steroids. Also my manager was not the first person to point out that my best friend loves me or is in love with me. I think I have come to the conclusion that she absolutely does love me and I think I have been playing Ostrich with the whole thing. How I feel about my best friend loving me despite being in a long-term relationship? I feel warmth, I feel fear of the unknown and I know that I feelings for her as well. I just wish she could trust me enough to be open with me. It makes me think twice about every single thing I have ever said or done to her and vice versa. Like our conversation Tuesday morning about her Endometrosis/Ovarian Cyst issue and how she has to wait until she is 40 and it upsets her since she can't have kids. I talked to my s/o about that and I later looked stuff up about it and I told by best friend that I was doing research for her.

This entry has extended greatly from its infant stages as I was writing this last Sunday night (Dec 1st) and I was hoping to add and update to this but it has been a canvas to tell my story about my wonderful best friend Kaylin. Judge me all you want I just originally wrote this a week ago seeing if others were coming to the conclusion I was arriving at and several others apparently have too.",1,1733642705.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

He then accused me of going around knocking on peoples doors in the middle of the night. He got a bunch of his friends to send in a complaint to head office accusing me. I proved to head office that I was not doing that. Since then he kept sending his friends up to my floor to knock on my door and then run away. This went on for several months. Whenever he saw me in the lobby he would point me out to people and tell them I was the one knocking on their doors all the time.  Soon I became hated through the building. When that failed to get me kicked out he broke into my mailbox and wrote me a letter stating ""I know it was you"".  He came banging on my door in the middle of the night demanding me to open my door so he could yell at me for knocking on someone's door that night. I called the police and he left. There is a stack of complaints over an inch thick I have submitted over this and head office has done absolutely nothing to him.

Could you sit down and have coffee with this guy if he was doing this to you? He has been going around and showing people the picture of me he took accusing me of knocking on peoples doors. I believe that is slander. I am disabled and on a low income so I cannot afford to pay a lawyer 400 dollars an hour to defend myself.

He was a manager and I worked with him but he not my direct boss though higher up the chain than me. So we met at work 

We first started texting and during summer did so almost daily. Sometimes it was about work and other times it was about our life outside of it. Sometimes we would share pics of things. It did seem to change a little when I said something about being just friends and then he said it too

At work I tried to keep things professional and I’m shy so it’s easier for me to talk in text and he was so focused and busy with other coworkers so I didn’t want to interfere. At one point he did invite me to eat lunch with him in his office which I did, but it was more like a work lunch as people came to stop by to ask him questions. As a friend and courtesy I would get him coffee once a month or so. During the lunch the convo went to hands momentarily when he asked me to reach out and compare his and so we ended up touching (it was part of a random convo)

People started kind of gossiping and speculating that I like him (and maybe him liking me I’m not sure) after that he backed way off like cut ties with me, like don’t talk and our boss heard about it. In fact he sort of made a complaint about me. But sometimes like we had a work meeting and I sat by myself and by the end he was standing near me. If I went down a hall to avoid him he would pursue/go down the same hall as me. Sometimes he would wait and hold the door for me(I realize this is common courtesy but it starts to maybe add up) During this time once he even playfully pretended to scare me and grab me from behind on my shoulders. 

A couple of other times he was talking with people and I was coming down the stairs and they were facing him but turned to look at me as if he was looking or had some expression that caused them to look. A couple of times I had a skirt and it wasn’t too short but as he walked by as I was with another female coworker it seemed he couldn’t help but look (as if he was checking me out) someone had apparently asked him if he was into me and he denied it completely. I always get compliments from staff on how I look and dress. However if I’m extra dressy and feel I look extra good looking it’s like he will ignore/not look at me. He once told me sort of randomly he thought I was absolutely beautiful inside and out 

We would talk about hanging outside of work to get coffee or drinks etc and he/we both agreed and said yes, but sometimes he would have other things and just seemed nervous to. 

I had told him several times before I felt confused with our relationship because he was like a boss but also a friend and sometimes I didn’t know how to address him and the boundaries of things. I had also told him I would not want to date someone I work with because of possible drama and how it would be if we broke up but still having to see the person at work. One time we had a whole “argument “ because there was an issue I had at work and I talked about going to the higher ups and I didn’t want to involve him because I felt we were too close and it Would be awkward and I was going to tell him but then I didn’t but he kept pressing me saying he was going to be stressed and worried about it as it sounded concerning 

Well he recently left and js at a new facility with the same company but now it may be different because he is not a manager and we aren’t coworkers. We slowly have started talking again but not as much of same as before

This device is incredibly flexible. I can use it as a tablet for browsing the web, a laptop for work tasks, or even as a sketchpad for drawing and taking notes. Everything runs smoothly, which is great considering how light and thin it is. It’s nice to have one device that can do so many things.

Of course, it’s not perfect. There are definitely times when a traditional laptop would be a better choice for specific tasks, especially for heavy-duty work like video editing or programming. However, the iPad Pro really shines in its ability to adapt to different situations. Whether I'm working on a document, watching a movie, or sketching out ideas, it handles everything well.

I chose the 11-inch model because it fits my needs perfectly. I find that a larger screen would be a bit cumbersome, especially when I want to relax on the couch and read. The smaller size makes it easy to carry around, and I can easily slip it into my bag when I’m on the go. Sometimes I think a bigger screen might be nice, but I haven't really needed it for what I do daily.

I also started using a reading app for magazines and news articles, and it’s been a pleasant surprise. I enjoy catching up on the latest news in the morning while I sip my coffee. The layout is clean and easy to navigate, which makes reading more enjoyable.

The Apple Pencil has been a fantastic addition as well. I love using it for drawing and taking notes. The gesture feature has turned out to be really useful, too; it makes the whole experience feel more intuitive.

One of the best aspects is how well it syncs with my iPhone. Everything works together seamlessly in the Apple ecosystem. I can easily share files, use apps across devices, and receive notifications without any hassle. It really enhances my overall experience.

Even though the M4 chip might seem like overkill for a tablet, it gives me peace of mind knowing that it can handle anything I need. I feel confident that this device will stay relevant and receive updates for a long time.

Overall, I’m really happy with this device. It meets my needs in so many ways and has made my daily tasks easier and more enjoyable. I can see myself using it for a long time to come!",6,1733642430.0,iPadPro,5,0.65,False

*Phadeæ, a member of the sarkoren species and the unofficial leader of the council decided to make small talk as they closed in on Terra.*

""So, this Terra, I heard it's well defended.""

*Another council member, drewêz from the bragreh people, spoke up in his usual stoic tone*

""We can't trust the words of merchants, that's why we're visiting.""

*Phadeæ silently nodded and decided not to continue the small talk since they were already ther-*

*The ship was shot while it was passing through the keiper belt, taking half of the particle barriers durability, the odd thing was, it wasn't a large kinetic shell, nor a concentrated laser, it was hundreds of thousands of small lasers from what seams to be...*

""Those aren't asteroids... They're turrents!""

*The rest of the council managed to stand up and see the shocking sight... The meteorites are artificial. As the turrents were about to fire a second time they were all disabled, the light blue glow of charinkov radiation from their railgun shells replaced by the light blue lights of 30 destroyers presumably of Terran origin.*

""This is within Terran Dominion! State your reason for being here or prepared to exit this mortal plane via firing squad.""

*Phadeæ immediately ran towards the nearest comm device and ordered the bridge to patch him to the Terrans ships*

""Ahem. I am Phadeæ, a member of COPS, we are simply here to visit the newest species on the interstellar stage.""

*The commander of the fleet of frigates, Churchill, seemed skeptical.*

""Then why do you have a ship thrice the size of our frigates.""

""Yes, SHIP, not plural, this is simply the main ship of the COPS. Not an invasion fleet.""

*Churchill visibly calmed down at his reasoning.*

""Then leave, and if you try returning, just so you know, we've replaced our entire keiper belt with superluminal railgun turrents.""

1h9dfni,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1h9dfni/my_gf_26f_is_chose_to_get_an_abortion_i_want_a/,"My GF (26F) is chose to get an abortion. I want a kid and she does not. I've been supportive of her decision and not tried to sway her, but is she purposefully trying to hurt me (M37)?","Last July I met an amazing woman on Hinge and we fell head over heels in love with one another. Life has been super fun and we've done all sorts of spontaneous trips and adventures in a short time. Truly special. She had to move two months into our relationship to get her Masters a couple of states over, but I've been flying out once a month or flying her out to spend a week. It's been worth it because she is truly special to me and at no other point in my life with any other woman have I been even remotely open to a long-distance relationship. I've scoffed at them, but here I am. I love her a lot. I've even been working towards going fully remote so that we can truly be together and she is aligned with this and has wanted it too.

That being said,  there are a few tragic differences between us that makes this a poor fit in the long run. She is quite a bit younger, but even if she was my age, she does not want children. Now, I don't want kids today or next year even, but at some point I think I do. Even with these big differences, we've done a nice job of focusing on how amazing of a time we have when together and have maintained a respectful tone and pretty open dialogue about what we each envision for ourselves. I love her a ton. She is fun, smart, gifted, motivating, kind, beautiful, all of it. I'm in love with her like some sweet idiot in a movie and I wouldn't have it any other way. Sweet sweet idiot.

Three paragraphs in, and it's probably pretty clear to you all that I'd love nothing more than to have kids and build a life with her. Even with my respect for what she envisions for herself, it also probably goes without saying that every part of my soul and every corner of my heart wishes she'd eventually warm to the idea of a family with me. Now, it's super important to me that everyone reading this trusts and believes that I don't bring it up much (hand to god!) or try to sway her. We've nearly gone our separate ways several times, amicably, knowing this is likely doomed in the long run. But, in random moments, and on her own accord, she has brought up that maybe her heart could change, and maybe she would be potentially being open kids with me. She has even teased me about baby names and other stuff related to ""when we have a kid"". I take it with a grain of salt, it's cute and fun, and even though I'd love for her to continue her amazing career journey AND have kids with me, I'd rather go our separate ways if it's not authentically in the cards for us or what she ultimately desires. I was raised by women who dream big, and that's the world I like to live in, and I'd never want her to do anything that would make her feel like she selling herself short or compromising her dreams. They are great dreams.  Even with her warming a bit, I'd never want it to feel like I'm pushing her into that decision. If she had a kid to appease me and it wasn't truly what she wanted, it would be unfair to the kid, to me, and to her. I love her so much, but a breakup is probably inevitable. Heartbreak is right around the corner, but that's ok, I'm a bit older now I recognize that pain is a part of life. Feeling this way about anyone is rare and special, so bring on the future heartbreak.

Flash forward to this past month, we've had a couple of arguments about pretty standard relationship stuff and decided to take a short break. Nobody cheated on anyone and I'm not skipping a spicy story or detail. I was off for Thanksgiving break and I get a phone call telling me that she is pregnant with my baby. She was crying, she was super upset, and we tried to figure out the math of it all because we have always done a good job of getting her a plan B. I told her I'd support her in her decision and I suppressed how I really felt for the first week. Eventually I voiced that I don't want her to sway her, but I do need her to know that I'd love her forever and would dedicate my life to her and our baby. I then did the mental gymnastics of reassuring her that I don't want her to feel any other way than how she does feel and I'll pay for everything and respect her decision. She made is pretty clear she wants an abortion, but she'd also allude to 10% of her feeling torn maybe. Bread crumbs for my sad soul. I ate ever crumb, but maintained my tone of ""what do you need, let's do it, this is your decision.""

I let her know that I'd fly out to support her when she got an abortion and that I'd spend 3-5 days taking care of her. It takes two to tango, we tangoed with the best of them, so I should be there. She had to get an ultrasound first, by law, which she scheduled to get a few days later and we kept in tight communication and I just don't want her to feel afraid of worried. She was texting me all about the length of pregnancy (5 weeks), and that she scheduled the actual abortion to take place in between Christmas and New Years. I bought a plane ticket out to go help. This isn't a boo hoo for me by the way, but my heart is heavy and I'm pretty damn sad about it. I am also happy that she is thinking for herself and not people pleasing. Now, the next day is when I went from feeling aligned to feeling bamboozled, hurt, and flat out mad.

A few hours after her appointment she sent me the image of the ultrasound. It didn't really look like a baby, more of a blob at this point, but knowing it would eventually grow to become our baby is a very powerful thing to see. I initially ignored her sending it to me because sometimes she is just annoying or quirky and so I didn't want to be confuse myself or assume she might possibly have mixed feelings on whether or not to keep it.

The way I see it, if two people are in love and want to have children together, seeing an ultrasound is likely one of the most magical moments in life. It's probably surreal. Now, if two people are planning to get an abortion, I'd imagine most in my shoes do not want to really sit with that image or look at it because you are seeing a potential tiny human that you are deciding against. That to me seems normal and logical, so it might also be logical to think that my girlfriend sending it to me would maybe mean she may want to keep that baby on some level.

So, the next day she asked if I saw that she had sent it to me and I said yes. She asked what I thought about it. Weird question in a way to me. I then asked her if she maybe has mixed feelings? She said no, outright, without hesitation. At that point I was a little hurt, which is where I begin to wonder if I'm perceiving all of this accurately because emotions can make us view most things differently under a lens.

I then said to her:

""I'll support you in any decision, glad you know what you want, but I can't imagine really wanting to see it or share it with me if you aren't at all conflicted.

Feels kind of cruel to show me the baby I can't have w/ you

does it just scientifically interest you

I think maybe I'm just misunderstanding""

I can recognize that I could have worded that differently, but the way I feel spilled over and I was a bit off the rails in how I felt, and from there we spiraled into a pretty hurtful argument. She then responded by saying things like ""I know you want this so bad, but I'm not changing my opinion"" and ""I think you are delusional"" and other things that hurt a lot. I've been in relationships where people spiral into saying awful things to one another and it never is for the best. I told her I don't want to hurt her, I'm not going to attack her, and asked that she at least understand how it would be confusing. but she pushed back by saying ""I thought you'd want to see it because you wanted to be here"" and I just felt so confused, but also so mad because I very clearly want to be there so that she doesn't feel scared or alone. I wasn't there for the free coffee and fun ultrasound image, not a big souvenir guy. She responded back saying I was attacking her and she took some low blows and I'm sure I did too.

This was a very long winded explanation, simply to ask... Is it weird of her to send me that ultra sound or am I so deep down sad that I can't have this kid with her that I am being weird? I am so confused and cannot tell if I'm just in a ton of pain and lacking the ability to be calm, or if she is as out of line as my emotions lead me to believe. An ultrasound would be something I'd cherish if we were planning to keep the kid. Why would I want to see that knowing she is clear on her decision?

My heart tells me there's some toxic stuff going on and that I ought to suck it up and walk through the fiery hell of heartbreak on my own accord rather than trying to engage re-engage. I have a plane ticket to go spend time with her during her abortion (the pill kind) and make sure she doesn't feel alone, because she asked me to be there. She wants me to be. I'm paying for it too, not that it matters, but just to say that if I don't end up being there with her, I'll still likely pay for it.

1h9deaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1h9deaf/how_i_stopped_letting_social_anxiety_run_my_life/,How I Stopped Letting Social Anxiety Run My Life :),"There was a time I couldn’t even walk into a coffee shop without feeling like all eyes were on me. My chest would tighten, my palms would sweat, and I’d obsessively rehearse what I wanted to say before stepping up to the counter. Every interaction felt like a performance where I had to *get it right*.

For years, I thought I was just shy, or maybe awkward. But the truth was, I was living with social anxiety—a constant fear of judgment that turned even simple things like talking on the phone or meeting new people into overwhelming tasks.

I want to share what helped me, both the hard-earned lessons from therapy and some unexpected tools that brought relief. If you’re in the thick of it, I hope this post reminds you that it *can* get better.





The real turning point for me was during therapy when I learned about **cognitive distortions**—those sneaky, distorted thought patterns that fuel anxiety. For example:

* **Mind Reading**: Assuming others are judging you (e.g., “They think I’m boring”).
* **Catastrophizing**: Believing one small misstep will lead to disaster (e.g., “If I stutter, they’ll never respect me”).

I was living in my head, running scripts that weren’t even real. My therapist taught me to notice these thoughts and gently challenge them. For example:

* Instead of “They think I’m weird,” I’d ask myself, “What’s the evidence for that? What’s the evidence against it?”
* Instead of “I have to be perfect,” I’d reframe it: “It’s okay to be human. People aren’t as focused on me as I think.”

It wasn’t a magic fix, but practicing this daily slowly rewired my mindset.

Here are a few actionable strategies that helped me take back control:

* **Exposure Therapy in Small Steps**Avoidance only makes anxiety worse. I started with manageable challenges—like saying “hi” to a cashier—and worked my way up to initiating conversations with strangers. Every success, no matter how small, built confidence.
* **The 3-Second Rule**If I overthought what to say, I’d freeze. So I started counting to three and saying whatever came to mind. It sounds scary, but it helped me break the cycle of overanalyzing.
* **Body Language Reset**I learned that your body influences your mind. Standing tall, keeping my hands visible, and making eye contact not only projected confidence but *helped me feel it too*.
* **Self-Compassion Mantras**When I messed up (and I did), I’d remind myself: “One awkward moment doesn’t define you. Everyone has them.”

Over time, I built a toolbox of resources that complement therapy and help me stay grounded:

Books

* **“The Confidence Gap” by Russ Harris**This book is a gem for understanding and managing anxiety through Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). It taught me that confidence doesn’t mean fearlessness—it means taking action even when afraid.
* **“Quiet” by Susan Cain**For introverts dealing with social anxiety, this book is a validating hug. It reframes quiet strengths and shows how to thrive without changing who you are.

Podcasts: **“The Social Anxiety Solutions” with Sebastiaan van der Schrier**Practical tips and strategies from someone who’s been through it. I especially appreciated his insights on reframing negative thoughts.

 Apps

1. **LePal**My friend, a former Google engineer, created this app after overcoming her own struggles with depression. What sets it apart is its *spirit pet*, which guides you through daily journaling and therapy-like activities in a fun, approachable way. I use it to reframe anxious thoughts and track progress. It feels like having a nonjudgmental therapist in my pocket, especially for those days when therapy feels out of reach.
2. **Insight Timer**Free meditations tailored to anxiety. I love using their live sessions for grounding when I feel overwhelmed.
3. **Shimmer**Tracks your moods and helps you identify patterns. Over time, I’ve learned what triggers my social anxiety and how to manage it better.





I’m not “cured” of social anxiety—it still pops up from time to time. But I’ve learned how to manage it, and it no longer controls my life. Therapy, practice, and these resources have all played a part.

What’s worked for you? I’d love to hear your tips, too. Let’s keep this conversation going. ❤️❤️❤️

The kind of good who would let a stranger die and not lift a finger in case they're bad.
The party was lovely but they hated most all of it.

1776 was a Pulitzer prize-winning book long before it was a movement by those who have never read it. It was a real life historical action movie of biblical proportions and awe inspiring accounts from boots on the ground.

More so than a book, it was a horrifying age in our country that actually happened. One which we should pray to never have to do again. That year it was justified -- to start. a war. -- for the future of the land & avoid a bigger war if the Crown consolidated control any further. A century later, some of these righteous ones used some part of that survivors spirit to fight for a less noble notion -- to set up a slave country where ""North of the Mason-Dixon, Y'all do whatchu want. We're Pharoahs Of the Missiipp.""

The wickedness made evil good. It caught like wildfire, largely because Business relied on that machinery for coomerce. 50% - 80% profit margins when you ain't paying anybody gets to feeling pretty cushy. Some obviously more comfortable than others. We give em a roof over their heads they rely on us for everything they owe us everything,"" Pharaoh said. We still work *and* earn and learn and teach to reach for every dime, cause they do make us earn it -- every step of the way. If you're a company that can, you should give it to em. Right now it's like someone in charge keeps  all the loaves and the fishes. 

Freedom's been ""handed"" to us one time we know of. That's Exodus. Look it up. Some people say it was God and the rest say... I guess ninjas, But we do know Hebrews didn't take credit for what happened. While most everybody agrees that a huge mass of underpaid working class Hebrews left Egypt much to then King's chagrin. They have never known freedom and then all of a sudden they were completely free like victims taken out of a bunker where they were kidnapped. Australia may relate. Chaotic instant freedom.

 People love the first part of Exodus. Bad guys lose, good guys win, victims closer to God. The second part is really what makes Exodus Exodus.  We're about to be going through a hard time like wandering through a desert a billion strong, And we got people stealing, we got people hating their neighbors, some even think it's okay to kill. You just can't live like that. We'd never survive the desert acting like that. Not for long. They had to build an airplane while it was flying, to govern themselves so they didn't break out into riots or splinter off in their own little groups to struggle and starve in the desert or go crawling back to Pharoah. 

They had generations living migrating through the desert , and they had to work together to make it livable, maybe even have some nice Sundays. They had jobs, and they worked. They raised families, fell in love. They lived entire lives wandering this hellscape. They taught their kids the many commandments and that kept the wheels from falling off. We might not can fix everything right this second, but *we can* help make our town a little nicer to call home. The long arc of the moral universe. Earth, as it is in heaven.

The crazy people been saying it for ever, the academics, for 50 years... And now just about everybody knows We are entering a critical and weird time, where we are already seeing the power of good cohesive communities to come together to weather hard times. Not business it's not technology, it's not even geopolitical: It's the evolution of problems originating from objective capitalism and centralized control.

Why do we really do anything? It shouldn't be profit. Profit just means that you can afford to keep doing it. The only real reason for doing stuff is to make stuff better. For somebody. Somewhere. They can be anywhere, and if it has value you're getting paid. Great! What matters? That's subjective, not wholly objective.

That's *why we invented money.* To reward you for how much you can make better for other people (without having to barter).

They say We *we're meant to be* a shining ""City on a hill,"" to show the world what God is like. Verbatim look it says that and means it. It's kinda the whole point, of any religion. It doesn't mean we want to be. It means that was the whole. That's the whole reason for being alive. We ask these righteous ones: Are your children fed? Are your sons and daughters clothed with shoes? Are your elders happy and wise? Is there laughter? Is there Joy on the streets where you live? Clean water? Worth coming to visit?

If not, why not? It's too hard. Ask ""if not me, then who?"" And WOE to anyone trying to stop the slow progress against the sands of time. Entire generations lived and died knowing only the sand. every. single. day. Everything mattered for survival, including the Sabbaths. Especially the Sabbaths. Without the Sabbaths we go crazy, there's no point, uprisings. And they had to hide their culture from bureaucratic quasi secularists who believed mysterious magical animal Gods control the weather. 

Now the coffee is nice, and the roads are paved, but we don't know where we're going or how we're gonna get there. And we *kinda** hope -- someone's gonna come save us. The picture is finally starting to become clearer that we *might ought to do something.* Could at least try.

We got wars we should be talking every single day how to stop them. For most of us that's a million miles away -- but we gotta be able to ask the right questions:  It's the most obvious thing in the world but if we can't ask the right questions then before we know it we're completely destroying lives, towns, cities, entire forms of government, entire languages of people. But why? What is that actually going to accomplish? Foreseeable consequences? You know normal decision-making questions.

But back at home we got problems need similar help. Just about every good idea, there's a government program or Grant out there or organization pushing along, and every single one of them could use a hand. Pretty much anything that you'd like to improve there's a group been looking for you.

Now this ain't about to get political. This is kinda past politics. We're only in the beginning of the evolution of problems of objective capitalism and centralized control, EPOCCC.

We just had a mammal virus infected the whole world. Thank God it wasn't any stronger, because we sucked at it. The Controllers bunkered down, the Free birds went overboard; And eventually we settled on ""pretty relaxed carefulness."" Now we got another one but it's coming out of birds, jumped into mammals. Pretty rare thing. Again coming from factory farming where these power strains come from. But don't worry, there's an army of scientists been studying this stuff like crazy for decades that's all they do. Some people got to take their nerd talk and translate it better to make it make sense. If fewer ideas make it on the chalkboard, you get verdict valued over deliberation.

And of course big business wanted us to go Free Bird right from the start. 
These righteous ones said *""we Have to let those who will die just die, so be it.""*     THEY DIDN'T EVEN WANT US TO TRY. 

And now we're all staring down the wrong end of the 21st century barrel, cruising through the sands of time asking ""paper or plastic?"" (The answer is bring your own). We had one of the rockiest spikiest mountainous tallest most beautiful resort parts of the country east of the Rockies, took on like a Year's worth of rain in a few days. It'll never be the same. The only thing holding that community together for a stretch was literally the people who live there, running four wheelers and donkeys through ravines to get water for their children and loved ones And neighbors to drink. They didn't need peacekeepers. They didn't need a ceasefire. Hell they didn't even need badges. Anyone who walked up ready to help was already a member. Biden declared the declaration which authorized FEMA to use funds to save lives and stabilize communities hit with disaster. That's all they do. They eat sleep and breathe disaster management. They practice. They run drills how to go in who to contact what groups to get together. 

 I want to hear them say it, why they hurt FEMA. I want to know how god-fearing Americans were told to form vigilante groups by famous people they trust, to go ""hunting"" the FEMA people on the ground. If that was a test the Appalachian people only passed because they didn't massacre a FEMA team... The bullshit didn't catch fire. I was afraid we were gonna have an IDF soup kitchen event. One of them even went and put his gun away, in his truck, that he had out ""hunting FEMA"" -- and once he saw what FEMA was really doing (when he found them which was easy) -- the dude immediately starts volunteering lifting and carrying shit left and right wherever it needed to go. I'd love to hear from that guy someday like a Netflix or 2020 special speaking with people who survived being swept up in bullshit.

And that's where we are today. There's a lot more people would like to be doing something good. During a catastrophic emergency it can be pretty obvious what you can do to help. These in-between times where troubles seem so far away, there's where most the work gets done. Take your pick. It's no less important now, while you're able, while the roads are working, with your high-powered super computer in your pocket. I can't get better power lines when they're frozen on the ground. Make hay while the sun is shining.

I can't partner with my local fire department to see what it would take to have coordinated backup/ emergency power for my local neighborhood, when the roads are all iced over and they're out pulling my friends out of the ditch. But I can check their website. I bet there's a Reddit post somewhere on small scale community backup power. And me I can't do it for you. More and more people feel like doing *something* anything. Once you get your foot out the door it's pretty easy to break the ice.

If you're a company who's polluting a stream that's messing with people's drinking water, you should be wanting and striving to fix that. We shouldn't have to ask...but now it's on us to ask... I want them to look you right in the eyes And see the future you're helping towards.  I want them to catch a whiff of that dream you see when if your efforts succeed, it's a better world for you and for me.  That's the new economy of universally nuanced subjective utilitarian-centered capitalism (UNSUCC).

Gotta UNSUCC the EPOCCC.

The last bit of the song is a speech from Kurt Travis and Lauren Johnson:

""Is she asleep?  
*Yeah, she knows it's bad from us boarding the windows, but she doesn't understand why*  
Sure she does, every adult she's seen today had it nailed to their faces like an eviction notice  
*So much nothing, it looks like television static eating up the horizon, how can we already be out of time?*  
We never made any, did we?  
We lost focus in our coffee cup tunnel-vision too many times  
Forgot the point, why were we here keeping this world alive?  
*How?*  
Meaning in life is just something we cultivate  
We start with an idea and run with it everywhere  
Like tired gospel, all the while it's dying in our heads  
*Like roses?*  
Exactly like roses, until it's not  
Then it's birthday presents, reality TV mainlining the happily ever after, and this, the white noise waiting outside our door""

  
I don't understand these metaphors they use, obviously they are discussing human purpose and how meaningless that concept is, but I don't understand what point they're trying to make and I'd like to reference this song in a paper I'm writing but I'm not comfortable to do that unless I understand the song's meaning. Also the rest of the song I'm unable to pull any meaning from, here's a link to the lyrics of the song:

He was a manager and I worked with him but he not my direct boss though higher up the chain than me. 

We first started texting and during summer did so almost daily. Sometimes it was about work and other times it was about our life outside of it. Sometimes we would share pics of things. It did seem to change a little when I said something about being just friends and then he said it too

At work I tried to keep things professional and I’m shy so it’s easier for me to talk in text and he was so focused and busy with other coworkers so I didn’t want to interfere. At one point he did invite me to eat lunch with him in his office which I did, but it was more like a work lunch as people came to stop by to ask him questions. As a friend and courtesy I would get him coffee once a month or so. During the lunch the convo went to hands momentarily when he asked me to reach out and compare his and so we ended up touching (it was part of a random convo)

People started kind of gossiping and speculating that I like him (and maybe him liking me I’m not sure) after that he backed way off like cut ties with me, like don’t talk and our boss heard about it. In fact he sort of made a complaint about me. But sometimes like we had a work meeting and I sat by myself and by the end he was standing near me. If I went down a hall to avoid him he would pursue/go down the same hall as me. Sometimes he would wait and hold the door for me(I realize this is common courtesy but it starts to maybe add up) During this time once he even playfully pretended to scare me and grab me from behind on my shoulders. 

A couple of other times he was talking with people and I was coming down the stairs and they were facing him but turned to look at me as if he was looking or had some expression that caused them to look. A couple of times I had a skirt and it wasn’t too short but as he walked by as I was with another female coworker it seemed he couldn’t help but look (as if he was checking me out) someone had apparently asked him if he was into me and he denied it completely. I always get compliments from staff on how I look and dress. However if I’m extra dressy and feel I look extra good looking it’s like he will ignore/not look at me. He once told me sort of randomly he thought I was absolutely beautiful inside and out 

We would talk about hanging outside of work to get coffee or drinks etc and he/we both agreed and said yes, but sometimes he would have other things and just seemed nervous to. 

I had told him several times before I felt confused with our relationship because he was like a boss but also a friend and sometimes I didn’t know how to address him and the boundaries of things. I had also told him I would not want to date someone I work with because of possible drama and how it would be if we broke up but still having to see the person at work. One time we had a whole “argument “ because there was an issue I had at work and I talked about going to the higher ups and I didn’t want to involve him because I felt we were too close and it Would be awkward and I was going to tell him but then I didn’t but he kept pressing me saying he was going to be stressed and worried about it as it sounded concerning 

Well he recently left and js at a new facility with the same company but now it may be different because he is not a manager and we aren’t coworkers. We slowly have started talking again but not as much of same as before

He was nervous in new situations which was of course understandable, but with gentle exposure and lots of treats, he’s adapted, opened up, learned a lot and become one of my greatest joys. He went to coffee shops with me, and even came to work with me occasionally! He loved all dogs and enjoyed people (after gentle introductions because he was shy.)

But two weeks ago on a walk, he basically attacked someone walking by out of the blue. Lunged toward them, jumped on them, and growled/barked in a scary way. I pulled him off and apologized, but my mental health has been a mess ever since. Later, he pulled super hard and fast toward a 10 year old that was walking by. I held him that time but I can’t stop thinking about it. My dog is 70lbs. Since then he has continued to show reactivity to random strangers (lunging) and being extremely reactive to big dogs passing, and I’m grieving the life I thought I had and the dog I thought I had. 

I’ve made a vet appointment, gotten a muzzle for training, and am talking to trainers about a behavior modification program (extremely expensive but necessary.) But I am still heartbroken. I’m prone to anxiety already, so I’m a bit more sensitive to things like this, but I just feel terrible all the time now. I feel naive for thinking I knew what my life would look like, and for thinking I could trust my dog’s personality for the last two years. Now, every decision I make has to consider my dogs reactivity. I even have to cancel my trip to see my family for Christmas because there are no sitters who are willing to work with this kind of situation, understandably.

He promptly told me to leave, but he was unaware of the fact I'm personal friends with the owner of the shop, so I gave the owner a call, told him what happened, and the barista was fired immediately.

Please let me know what you think or how your relationship woks, thanks! 

Hubby (M57) got super mad and screamed at me (F52) when I tried to very calmly (this is important) talk to him about something that has bothered me for quite a while but has been really on my mind as of late.
We have been married for 20+ yrs and have spent a good chunk of that time apart due to his military service & work after his retirement since he still works for the military, just as a civilian instead of active duty. There are some issues relating to other things but the one at the forefront today was the fact that he doesn't seem to pay attention to anything I like to eat. Hubby likes to eat out on weekends & today he ran to Home Depot & a few other places & on his way home asked me if I wanted anything for lunch. I told him I would like 2 GRILLED CHICKEN TENDERS from the local place we eat at often. I said it exactly like that because I have learned that I have to be VERY specific because for some reason, even after over 20 years of marriage, my husband seems to have zero clue what I like to eat.  I could literally walk into ANY restaurant & order him a complete meal EXACTLY how he would like it with additions & substitutions.  He came home with breaded, fried chicken Tenders. I have absolutely HATE breaded chicken tenders. I took them out of the bag & of course my face fell. Hubby immediately gets pissed &  raises his voice saying, ""what now?"" I just said ""nothing, it's fine, no problem"" & I was just going to eat what I could because I didn't want to make him more upset. He started getting louder saying, ""what's wrong this time?"" & crap and I just said quietly that ""I just asked for grilled chicken but that's OK, I will eat this, no problem. He got all sorts of pissed saying that I never told him that & I just said chicken Tenders, etc & grabs his phone to show me he's right & as soon as he looks at the message he gets even more mad, throws his lunch on the counter & yells ""fine, I'll go get you some damn grilled chicken!""  I did my best & got him to calm down & sat down to eat.  It's at this point I made my mistake. I asked him if I could talk to him about something I have been thinking about without him getting mad or upset or offended and then proceeded to basically ask him how is it that we have been married so long & I know exactly how he likes literally everything, down to how much cream & sugar in his coffee but he doesn't seem to know anything about what I like? (not exactly how I worded it, just Condensed for time) He, of course, starts getting indignant, saying ""I thought you just wanted chicken tenders....."" So I very softly replied, ""Huney, have you honestly ever, in 20 years, seen me eat breaded chicken tenders, ever? Even once?"" That was the end! He jumped up & started screaming at me at the top of his lungs how I think I'm so f-ing smart & how I think I know everything & how ever since I became disabled (I have severe lung issues & am on oxygen 24/7 plus a myriad of other problems... All out of nowhere) I just sit around & bi**H about everything & think I know everything about everything & yadda, yadda, yadda...

Now let me just jump in here & say I would give ANYTHING to not have all these health issues. To be able to walk 15 ft to the bathroom without gasping for air, or walk the fur-babies to the dog park around the corner without my leg going totally numb because my back is so damaged. I was working 10 hour days/6 days per week all throughout the pandemic doing very physical work. I have always been a very active person. I raised 6 kids (yours, mine & ours) while he was TDY or deployed for years, sometimes working multiple jobs. I HATE my body! I HATE not being able to even stand long enough to cook myself a meal. I HATE that this illness has literally taken everything from me & made me wholly dependant on others. I am the one who ALWAYS took care of everyone else. I am the oldest daughter of 6 siblings who grew up in the 70s & 80s....IYKYK. (I honestly try not to be a bother to hubby or daughter but everything I seem to do or say just seems to piss them off.  I have stopped asking for anything unless they offer because I don't want to be a burden. I try to just sit in my chair next to my oxygen concentrator & watch TV. But it seems like if I even ask for a napkin with my dinner they get exasperated with me. I try to do things for myself & get yelled at. I don't know what to do anymore.)

ANYWAY.... He threw his lunch across the kitchen, into the sink (which he does whenever he gets mad at someone during meal time) refused to eat, stomped out of the house, slammed the door & took off in his car. He came back a while later & just ignored me the rest of the night. Made himself something to eat for dinner but I had to wait until our daughter (F20) got home from work so I could ask her to please make me something. 
I realize he is stressed between crap at work, having to take care of me, money issues (there is zero way I can work, at all now) but I don't think I was acting like a know-it-all or anything just because I was trying to have an honest conversation about how I feel. 

So, please tell me... Does your S/O know what you like to eat? Do you know their order? Does it even matter? 

Thanks!

**TL;DR;**
Hubby never seems to know what I like to eat, even after being married for over 20 years. I tried to gently talk to him about how I was hurt by the fact and he blew up at me. Saying I'm a know-it-all. 
I am very dependent on him due to being disabled so I'm sure that adds stress to his plate. 
I am just wondering if other people know what their partners like to eat & can anticipate/order for them like I can for my husband or if it's not really a big deal & I am blowing things out of proportion. ",0,1733640607.0,relationships,11,0.5,False

I’m going to give the full story and try not to leave any details out.

Sarah and I dated for about 3 months which has been my longest relationship so far. We met through an activity we both shared 2 years ago in high school and I thought she was just a cool person at the time. I was dating a different girl and wasn’t really interested in Sarah, she wasn’t really my type. She started constantly talking to me and I responded but never really reached out further. After about a year, I was talking to one of Sarah and I’s mutual friends and he flat out said to me that Sarah and him were coming over to my house that weekend and didn’t give me anytime to answer. He also said that Sarah had a huge crush on me for a year. They both came over to my house and we watched a movie. They both left and I thought nothing of it, then Sarah started texting and snapping me constantly. I was a little weirded out by this because she was in the grade below me but I still texted and snapped her back. We started calling constantly and she told me all the time how hot I was which was a little weird to me because no girl had ever said that to me so this was all very new. I took her on 2 or 3 dates that went well, but the whole time I was talking to her the whole thing felt off. She was a lot more immature for her age and we didn’t really have the same interests. There were lots of things I wasn’t really comfortable with like sending her pictures of my abs which she was quite upset that I wasn’t willing to do that. All my friends and family saw that I was leading her on and told me to cut it off. It took me a while but one day after 4 months of talking she called me hot and I sent her a huge paragraph about how there was just too much stuff going on and that I couldn’t date her. She was devastated, which was the right reaction because I was an asshole for leading her on for so long.

Fast forward to about a year later and she now has several classes with me and we start talking at the start of the new school year. She was like a brand new person, she was funny and interesting and a lot more attractive to me by the way she acted and looked. Before when she was a lot more shy and quiet, I kind of had to lead the way when we hung out but now she was loud and extroverted and not afraid to speak her mind. She had a completely different friend group and a completely different way of thinking. So this time around, I really liked her. After a while of talking, I asked her out to the homecoming dance of my senior year. She said yes, but said I needed to also make her a hoco sign. I asked her to go ice skating and hinted that I would bring the sign and she brought all her friends along which at the time I didn’t think anything of. She loved the sign and her friends were all really excited to go to homecoming too. These same friends went with us to dinner before homecoming and I had a great time with them. Sarah was closest with a girl named Emily and was a little less close with Sophia. At the dinner, my group of friends also booked reservations at the same place and one of them caught the attention of sophia. Then when we all went to homecoming, sarah and I forced Emily and my friend Justin to slow dance next to Sarah and I. Before homecoming I told Sarah that we were going to kiss at homecoming, I had said this so that we were both on the same page about what was going to happen and so that I wasn’t going to be petrified of the idea of her not wanting to kiss me. Right at the end of the slow dance, Sarah and I locked eyes and she grabbed me by the head and kissed me once. That was my first kiss and I don’t think I will ever be able to forget the picture of her face while we were slow dancing. Homecoming was incredible and was the most fun I’d ever had with a girl. After that Sarah, Emily, and Sophia were all yelling at me and asking me if Sarah and I were officially dating. I said yes reluctantly because I was a little worried that we were moving to fast since it had only been a few weeks. The best part about those few weeks was that unlike every other girl I talked to, I actually knew that Sarah liked me and it wasn’t this long thing with me worrying about whether she liked me back. Then once we started dating, Sarah and Emily made a group chat with Justin and I. We all called and texted on this constantly. I was okay with this but I also asked Sarah if we could call and text one on one and she said she didn’t like one on one calls because there were always long awkward pauses. I explained that I didn’t really enjoy group calls because I can never get a word in and that Sarah and Emily would gang up on me. I compromised and said that I was fine with just group calling. From then on me and Sarah never called each other once, she always just called the group chat when I called her. Things were going well despite this, I talked to her when I could in the halls and occasionally hung out with her after school. I had thought that since she really wanted ab pics last time I talked to her that I would send her some now that we were dating. I was still a little uncomfortable with it but since I have had other girls including Sarah ask me for them I sent them anyway. She liked them and that was about it. About a month into the relationship, we had hung out a couple times. We went roller skating with her friends, we went to fun fore all with her friends, and we went on a double date with Emily and Justin. When we hung out afterschool she would ask me to grub hub her food for her and her friends, which cost me a lot since I am flat broke but I did because I really really liked her and didn’t want to seem like a shit boyfriend to her friends. Sarah had mentioned love letters, so I wrote my heart out into a letter. I wrote about Homecoming and how much I liked her and how great of a person she was. She loved the letter and texted me about how much it meant to her. She wrote me a letter about how she has never had a guy treat her as good as I had and she signed it with 7 little kisses on the bottom, the letter also had a very strong smell of her perfume which I loved. We never kissed, which I was completely fine with until I talked to my friend Oliver. Oliver was 2 grades below me, he had recently got a girlfriend and they were making out constantly. Anytime he saw her that’s all they would do. He told me that Sarah and I’s relationship was awful because we weren’t making out. I was confused because I had never really thought about how little we were kissing, which wasn’t at all. The next month I started getting a little sad. I felt like Sarah wasn’t putting in as much effort into the relationship as I was. She refused to turn on read receipts on her texts, and she wasn’t really texting me at all. She only ever texted or called me in the group chat. I could sense this so I tried really hard to write her the best letters and I bought her dunkin’ donuts and her favorite coffee for our 1 month anniversary. I might have messed up and made her uncomfortable because I sent her 3 ab pics during this month too which she responded the same way for all of them. We hung out once or twice during this month with her friends but that was about it. At the end of the first month I was upset about how Sarah was being distant and was complaining to my friend. My friend then asks me “Have you hung out with her just you and her?” and that made me realize, I had never talked to her, just her and me… ever. My whole view on the relationship was completely shattered. I was incredibly sad and started stupidly texting her about how I was sad she didn’t call or text me and that I felt like it was hard to tell if she even likes me. She responded and said she does like me but her feelings were complicated and that she needed time to think. I said okay, but I was completely confused and sad. For the next day all I did was think about what I had done wrong and didn’t know what to do. I was in the worst possible mindset I could have been in and then stupidly I decided to hang out with Oliver. Sarah, Emily, Justin, and I had a planned double date coming up in 4 days and I was confused about whether Sarah and I would still be together until then. I was talking to Oliver about this and Oliver told me that the reason she doesn’t hangout with me or call with just me and her is because I wasn’t being forward enough. He gets it into my head that I needed to do the same thing I did at homecoming and text her saying that we were going to make out at this planned double date. I, like a dumbass, listened to him and text her this. She responds with “oh?” and Oliver is like “DUDE SHE SAYING OH BECAUSE SHE WANTS IT” and I STUPIDLY keep elaborating on what’s going to happen. I didn’t get too far because she kept saying dry answers then said “i’m not really comfortable with that.” Oliver then says “damn I guess you messed up, at least we now know she doesn’t want to do that.” The next few days were rough. I had no texts, no snaps, and no calls. I was depressed thinking about what I should have done differently.  Sophia then texted me that Sarah needed time to process her feelings but that Sarah also wanted me to fix things. Then that night I asked Sarah to call or hangout in person, so that we could talk because I didn’t want to text so that my tone couldn’t be misinterpreted and so that her friends couldn’t reply for her. She said she was only willing to text. I tried to compromise and say that we call but she responds through text. She said no and that she was confused by how she said she needed space and I wasn’t giving it to her. I was taking Sophia’s advice to try and fix things which was probably really stupid looking back. Then 2 days before the double date I sat with Emily, Sophia, and Justin at lunch and told them that if Sarah doesn’t talk to me by tomorrow morning i’m breaking up with her. Sarah then texted me asking what was going on, I didn’t respond for an hour. Then she sent me a text saying we were breaking up. I said I didn’t want to break up and that if we talked about it we could fix our issues. She said no, and that she wasn’t ready for a relationship right now. 


In retrospect, I would have done lots of things differently. I shouldn’t have listened to Oliver at all, he was a lot younger than me and didn’t know what he was talking about. I can entirely understand where Sarah was coming from and that this weird big dude was telling her that she was going to make out with him. I think I was also scared because all the previous girls I dated or talked to all said I wasn’t forward enough and that I would never kiss them. So I tried extra hard to do that with Sarah and I should have respected her boundaries. On the other hand, Sarah isn’t completely innocent either. She never hung out with me ever, which i’m only realizing now is that I was always surrounded by her friends for the whole relationship. Every text, call, or in person conversation was influenced by her friends. Even the break up text was sent by her friend. Still after all this I’m still incredibly sad and heartbroken since this was the first girl that I actually really liked and that actually liked me back. I’m not sure how to move on since I still talk to some of her friends and Justin is still dating Emily. 

Sorry for the long story, I would like any advice on what I did wrong and can fix for my next relationship or if I ever talk to Sarah again. Please feel free to flame me for any mistakes, I realize I made plenty of them. ",1,1733640196.0,teenrelationships,0,0.99,False

For context, this is my first electric and flat burr grinder that I've owned. Out of box, the grind adjustment is super smooth and fluid, and the grinder is extremely silent when turned on. 

However, after grinding a small amount of beans, I quickly notice that the sound feedback from the grinder is different (louder and higher-pitched) than before I have ground any beans. Additionally, the grind adjustment collar has stiffened up and turning it to adjust the grind size is no longer as smooth as it was.

The only way to 'reset' this is push through the stiffness on the collar, to go to an extremely fine setting (number 2), where a tiny bit of coffee is pushed out. Then, the sound returns to normal and the adjustment collar is smooth again. 

Apart from this behavior, the grinder is performing well. The grind sizes are coming out as indicated in the manual, the variable RPM works well, and the user experience is very pleasant. 

If there are others who own the VS6, I'd like to check if this is normal behavior or if I have a faulty unit on my hands? ",1,1733640136.0,VariaBrewing,0,1.0,False

Stayed for 6 nights at Shinjuku & since I'm a solo traveller, I went to book my self to a capsule hotel which is affordable and quite convenient. Internet Data is important so you won't get lost bought mine at Airalo app, Tokyo is a big city, I always bring train maps for JR line and the Tokyo subway. Bought unlimited 3 day subway pass via klook, Suica is also important for JR lines, I somehow maximize my journey to each main city destinations and other stations too.
Mainly went to Shibuya, Roppongi, Ueno, Asakusa,Akasaka, Akihabara, Meijo jingomae, Tokyo, Harajuku, Explored the seibu lines as well and others stations I can't remember. I never paid for tickets and went to see beautiful parks and enjoyed all sorts of food, and it was amazing. 
For future travellers, wear comfy shoes and prep your self to walk al lot. I mean I walked minimum of 25,000 steps a day, unless you want to spend on a taxi which is very expensive.
Learn to analyze their trains, it's easy for me Atleast to understand, but I got lost on day 2😂. So I really need to learn how to use their trains. I usually leave early like 7am to avoid rush hour and eat breakfast at lawsons,7/11, btw you can't eat inside the convenience stores. Coffee and Melon pan for the win, soft boiled egg is a winner. Google translate is helpful and Japanese pips are helpful, well for my experience. Places in Japan are mostly clean, however some over rated tourist spots like shinjuku is kinda dirty, maybe because all kind of ethnicity is present. Beware of scams esp in shinjuku bars, hotels in main shinjuku is mostly loud so beware. Japan is amazing and I'll be back for more. Refrain from eating at the 2nd floor of kabuckiko tower, It's not worthy. Plan ahead so you know where to go the next day, watch videos from socmed and see their go-to places.

We had our first 'date' at the end of August, and things started off great—we were seeing each other weekly for about a month. Then his work got really busy (he’s the only employee at his job now), and over the last two months, we’ve been seeing each other less often—more like once a month now.  

At first, I thought we were just friends because he wasn’t overly flirty or forward. But on our third date, he put his arm around me and held my hand, which definitely gave me romantic vibes. Since then, we’ve had other dates where he’s done similar things—like cuddling during a movie at my place and even moving my leg to wrap around him—but we still haven’t kissed or had any clear physical progression.  

I really liked the slow pace at first because it felt intentional and thoughtful, but now I’m confused. It’s been several months, and while his actions feel too intimate for just friends, they’re also not consistent or forward enough for me to feel confident he’s fully into me.  

He’s shared some personal things, which makes me think he trusts me, and he has also brought up future plans like going for coffee and continuing to hang out. But he hasn’t said anything directly about how he feels about me, and he doesn’t compliment me in ways that would make his interest obvious.  

I don’t know if he’s just shy, inexperienced, or not as invested as I am, but the mixed signals are throwing me off. I’m trying to go with the flow, but the lack of clarity after all this time is starting to make me feel stuck.

I work (in a kitchen) with a 50 year old woman who is a lifelong cross-addict with a history of eating disorders, alcoholism, chain-smoking, sex addiction, etc, and is basically constantly talking about relapsing and recovering from one thing and the other thing. 

She is CONSTANTLY asking everyone to taste her food because she refuses to taste her own cooking. She gets REALLY upset if I decline and usually says something like ""You're just trying to make me feel like a fatass, huh?"" She was eating a cookie and offered me a cookie, and when I said no, she threw both cookies in the trash and said ""You made me feel like a pig today."" When she sees me eating she'll say things like ""Is that ALL you're going to eat?"" and pressure me to eat some of her food, and when I decline she says things like ""You hate me then?"" It makes me feel really bad. 

I talked to my boss about these incidents and he told me that I should 1) ignore it and that she has already spoken to him about me because I am ""constantly triggering her to relapse"" because of my low body weight and declining food. He asked me if there was any way I could avoid triggering her. I think it is very clear that I send off a ""vibe"" but I do not know how to mitigate it. We all wear the same uniform clothes at work, and I am a modest dresser for religious reasons and am super lame, so I do not want to make this seem like I'm dressing like a Korean Pop model or have my boobies out or something. 

The other thing that I do not know how to handle is that she will accuse me of tampering with her food, usually in really outlandish and unbelievable ways. For example, she has asked me multiple times if I put butter or creamer in her coffee mug while she was in the other room. She says things like ""This tastes greasy, you didn't just mix some oil into my food, did you do that? Did you put oil into my food?"" and I really have zero clue how to respond. She doesn't treat anyone else this way at work. 

I have a lot of sympathy for her and I do not know how to stop triggering her, and I can't really find anything about this sort of situation online. What's the socially polite thing to do here? I think my boss had no idea either. ",17,1733639831.0,TooAfraidToAsk,13,0.91,False

They decided to come up and visit- we live in a large apartment and while we have a guest room, our guest bed is not big enough for a couple.

I made dinner (soup) and I realized I didn’t have many bowls… my partner and I live alone and we don’t entertain guests very much, so we don’t keep an abundance of extra plates and other dishes.

I'm typically pretty good at gifts but seem to be hitting some kind of block and am totally blanking on these two and need help!!!

\#1: For my mum who I love dearly - she's going to Paris for the first time with her husband later this year, and is incredibly excited. She doesn't tend to treat herself but deserves the entire world. She loves the outdoors, learning new things, healthy living (loves walks, is vegetarian bordering on vegan), and isn't really into food, drinking, sports, or excessively materialistic/statusy (like, not into handbags, logos, etc.). I'm looking for a slightly offbeat experience or item for her on her trip. She already has lovely luggage, so that's a no go. Budget is $200ish, but doesn't need to fulfill the whole budget - have some other ideas to fill in :) I'm hoping for something kind of special/unique that might not show up on like a ""top #10 things to do in Paris"" list but would really elevate the experience for her! 

  
\#2: I was assigned a 23 year old coworker for secret Santa. Budget is $20CAD, but willing to spend closer to $20 USDish. The issue is, she's incredibly cool. Like amazing fashion sense, really offbeat, creative, can talk to literally anyone. I don't know her well, but feel like a bottle of wine/coffee gift card isn't gonna cut it. Looking for something interesting, but useful, but don't know her super well, and feeling a bit constrained by the price cap.

I recently spent a week exploring Zion National Park, and let me tell you - finding good food spots was just as important as hiking Angels Landing! I wanted to share my favorite places to eat because I know how overwhelming it can be to plan a trip here.

Before I dive in, I found this awesome site that helped me plan my entire Zion adventure: https://athometouch.com/zionpark. They've got some great deals on activities and tours - definitely worth checking out!

Now, let's talk food! 

Whiptail Grill in Springdale is hands down my favorite spot. It's housed in an old gas station (how cool is that?) and serves amazing Mexican fusion food. Their fish tacos are to die for, and the outdoor seating gives you incredible views of the red rocks.

King's Landing Bistro is perfect for those wanting a fancier dinner. A bit pricey, but their locally-sourced menu and wine selection make it worth every penny. The duck breast is incredible!

For quick bites between hikes, I loved MeMe's Cafe. Their sandwiches are perfect for packing on trails, and their breakfast burritos gave me the energy I needed for those early morning starts.

If you're on a budget, Sol Foods Supermarket is a lifesaver. They have a great deli section and reasonable prices. I saved tons by making my own trail lunches here.

Oscar's Cafe is another must-visit. Their burgers are massive and their patio is perfect for people-watching after a long day of hiking. The sweet potato fries with honey butter - trust me on this one!

Deep Creek Coffee Co. became my morning ritual. Great coffee, fresh pastries, and they open early enough for sunrise chasers.

Pro tip: Most restaurants in Springdale (the town right outside Zion) get super busy during peak season. I recommend making dinner reservations if possible.

Speaking of planning ahead, check out https://athometouch.com/zionpark for some awesome guided tours and activities in Zion. I booked a canyoneering trip through them and it was one of the highlights of my visit!

French apple tart - it is underrated because nobody was buying it on Thanksgiving. It is a spiced apple tart in a buttery pate' sucree crust. You have to do it ala mode style either whipped cream or ice cream. My brother loved this tart. I have to buy 2 of them, if I am shopping at TJ. 5/5. If you see any pumpkin pies, please consider this tart for Christmas desserts. Not too sweet desserts has a place at the dinner holiday table. I fall in that category because I really hate cloyingly sweet desserts.

Mousse tiny cakes (petit four) - 1 pack have 3 dark chocolate petit fours, 3 vanilla bean mousse petit fours and 3 cappuccino espresso  mousse ith chocolate cake and dark chocolate ganache filling. I liked  out of 3 flavors. Dark chocolate and the cappuccino espresso mini cake is my favorite as it has a nice balance of lightly sweet, deep coffee and chocolate flavors. All of the elements of the composed dessert were perfectly balanced. 4/5.

Rabiyot Royale - fig with chocolate ganache and some brandy flavoring. Pretty good but as kind of bummed they ued brandy flavoring intead of brandy. But hey, this is great option of gifts during the holiday, or you can add to your dessert or charcuterie and cheese boards. 4/5.

Lebkuchen - I was curious and tasted the lebkuchen from Belgium. It might be from Antwerp, Belgium because it is the border of the Netherlands and Germany. The warm spiced cookie tasted fine but it was nutty, but the royal icing tasted like soap or detergent. Not recommended! 1/5. It was awful! 

Dark chocolate orange made in Belgium - I am not a fan of it because they used 70% to 80% dark chocolate, but the orange flavor oil is there. 2.5/5.

Boule of Italian chocolate from Italy - pretty good assortment of flavors and best bang for few bucks. 3.5/5.

Maple butter from Canada that was released before Thanksgiving! I had bought 4 jars of it. Best seller and it as the best most delicious butter distributed from TJ. 6/5! It was seasonal. It is better than speculoos cookie butter but not given that much hype! I just wish it is available every BER months of the year.

Peppermint Joe Joe's and the Holiday Multitude of Joe Joe's - you can choose one holiday flavor, or go big and go home with an assortment of holiday themed flavors. I tried the Peppermint Joe' Joe's and it is a refreshing flavor for the holidays. The holiday multitude is for a special someone that loves these cookies hich are dark chocolate, gingerbread, vanilla ginger and raspberry flavors. There is something for everyone! 3.8/5!

Baci Premium Italian bonbons - cheap but premium exquisite Italian choco hazelnut bonbons. Famous and popular for $10.99. 4.3/5.

The mini panettone - a great gift for teachers and that special person. Delicious! 3.9/5.

The advent calendar of beauty products - I bought  of these for my co-workers. Nice gift and deal - $19.99. 5/5!

\*\* My store is always busy and it is the best time to shop either on early mornings or after 7pm. It is non-stop everyday. Best-selling and new products sold out within 30 minutes to half day, but the team lead order more cases to replenish stock for other people to buy their products.

Better than some introductory post, maybe this can give a more accurate idea of how I write and if that would appeal.

As Christmas is fast approaching what’s your general theory on gifts? Part of being an adult seems to be a growing list of people to get gifts for that you know less and less every year. I tend to opt for food gifts on the theory that someone that drinks coffee will at least use the coffee you get them at some point, even if it’s less than ideal. I’ve also started to repeat food gifts for people and come to the realization I’m the people my parents complained about sending fruit cake every year. Oh well, you live long enough to become the villain.

Of course holidays also make me think about nostalgia for my childhood, even in not-specifically-holiday-related ways. One thing that makes me nostalgic would be road maps. I remember getting to sit in the front seat on family road trips so I could read the map for my dad driving, which gave me a certain pride feeling useful. And of course stopping to ask for directions, what an experience I may never have again. What sorts of small experiences or ads or sodas or whatever are you nostalgic for? I wonder what will resonate for kids growing up right now, hard to imagine for me but surely it’ll be something.

Would you be interested in reading a book together? Or maybe learning something like a language? I’d love to try latin or greek, especially with a partner to keep me honest and motivated. For reading, I was thinking of some fun old pulpy adventure, like some Robert Howard Conan stories. But hey, if you have a better idea I’m happy to try it!

Not much for a first message, but maybe something in this appeals to you. Feel free to respond to it, or just write diary-style whatever may be on your mind. I’m looking forward to hearing from you!",1,1733638508.0,penpals,0,1.0,False
