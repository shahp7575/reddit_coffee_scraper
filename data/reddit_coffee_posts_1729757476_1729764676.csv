1gaz1u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/RestlessLegs/comments/1gaz1u3/pregabalin_worsening_rls_plmd/,Pregabalin worsening RLS & PLMD,"Hi

I've been taking Pramipexole (currently 2 x 18mg/day) for the past 4 years. I really want to get rid of this as I'm worried about both augmentation (which I'm already experiencin) and other side effects (excessive behaviour). 

As mentioned by the Mayo Clinic paper I tried oral iron supplements with Vit C for the last 6 months. This was in agreement with my neurologist. Over the last 6 months I was able to lower the pramipexole from 3 to 2 times 18mg/day, but lowering further is not possible. My blood iron levels are perfectly fine.

The last 2 months my sleep quality has drastically worsened and I'm constantly tired. I see no pattern in external factors such as alcohol, smoking or coffee. (I don't drink often, quit smoking mostly and limit coffee. I also do normal runs 3 times a week).

My doctor wanted me to try and start with pregabalin, starting with 0,25mg/day and increasing every 3 weeks if needed. only if my symptoms are stable for 3 weeks, I can lower the pramipexole. This is to assess over enough time the correct impact.

So currently I've done pregabalin 0,25mg and pramipexole 2 x 0,18mg/day for the last 3 days. Since then my sleep got even worse. I experience hours of insomnia during the middle of the night combined with mild RLS symptoms. I'm completly exhausted and have no energy left to continue this.

Does anyone know if these are normal effects during combining pregabalin and pramipexole?",1,1729764393.0,RestlessLegs,0,1.0,False

My SO likes more course ground coffee for cold brew (grind setting around 55) and I use it for espresso (around 10-15). I've noticed that after we grind at 55, the machine will chirp a bit as I slowly go back down toward 10 (I ALWAYS keep the machine on while doing this, and the chirp isn't consistently happening throughout the decrease). Once I get to around 10-15 everything is fine, and the noise stops. Anyone else having a similar issue with this?",1,1729764286.0,DF54,1,1.0,False
1gaz0rp,https://www.reddit.com/r/rabies/comments/1gaz0rp/should_i_be_worried_maybe_controversial/,Should I be worried? (Maybe controversial),"This happened some half an hour ago.

I was travelling on the highway in my country. I stopped on a highway rest stop (you know, gas station, coffee shop...) and the line in the toilet was long, so I went behind the dumpsters to pee. As I finished, my hand grazed a leaf of a plant of some sort there. I immediately applied some rubbing alcohol there, but only later I realized it's 45% ethanol. 

To make matters worse, I have a slight scratch on the pinky finger of my other hand. So, while that hand didn't touch the leaf, I'm afraid that if I did have something on my other hand (the hand that did touch the leaf), I might have spread it to the place of that scratch.

What I'm worried about is what if a sick fox came to that plant, chewed it or licked it, and got some of its saliva on my hand? Could I catch rabies, especially if I transferred it to the scratched part of my other hand.

Some info that might be relevant:

The highway rest I stopped on is near a forest, so there is a chance wild animals come to it, especislly near the dumpsters. 

The weather is 60 degrees Fahrenheit and slight rain and fog. I'm worried that the saliva of an infected animal didn't have a chance to dry out, if it touched that plant.

My country had the last imported case of human rabies in 1995. Last indigenous case was in the 1960s. Dog vaccinations are strictly mandated and there is a regular program of vaccinating wild foxes through baits. Last confirmed case of a rabid wild animal was in 2014, so my country got the status of ""rabies free country"" from the EU.

Last fox vacvination campaign was in June this year, wia dropping baits from the air.

Finally, I have clinically diagnosed OCD, with significant emphasis on blood/infection fears.


Do you think what I described counts as a potential exposure? Should I talk to my doctor about it? Or the infectious disease specialists in the hospital? Or is this my OCD creating irrational fears?

Thank you for your time.

Edit: to give more info: the country is Croatia, I have never been vaccinated against rabies, and since I didn't interact with an animal, I can't say anything about the status of the potential animsl that I worry I might have had indirect contact with.",1,1729764269.0,rabies,1,1.0,False

1gayytp,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthTrendz/comments/1gayytp/does_oatzempic_diet_challenge_work_for_weight_loss/,Does Oatzempic diet challenge work for weight loss?,"    If you spend time on TikTok or keep up with the latest diet trends you might have come across the Oatzempic diet. It has been a buzzing topic of late.
    
    It‚Äôs a play on the popular weight-loss medication **Ozempic**. Instead of a pharmaceutical solution, **Oatzempic** is all about using oats, lime juice and water to create a drink that some users claim helps with weight loss. However, **before you rush to the kitchen**, it‚Äôs important to know a bit more about the potential magic solution.
    
    ## What is the Oatzempic Diet?
    
    The **Oatzempic diet** is essentially a meal replacement drink. Here‚Äôs how you go about it..
    
    - It combines **3 basic ingredients**: ¬Ω cup of rolled oats, 1 cup of water, and juice from half a lime.
    - Some people add **cinnamon** or fruit like **bananas** for extra flavor.
    - The recipe is **simple** and uses ingredients that most people already have at home.
    - It is an **accessible option** for anyone looking to try it.
    
    So why all the hype? TikTok users are claiming that this concoction helps them lose weight by **reducing hunger** and making them feel fuller for longer. The idea is that the **fiber** in the oats slows down digestion, helping you stay satisfied while consuming fewer calories.
    
    Oatzempic is liked because it‚Äôs a **low-calorie option** that helps with fullness while maintaining a **caloric deficit**.
    
    ## The Science Behind Oatzempic
    
    When it comes to understanding why the **Oatzempic diet** might work?
    
    It all comes down to the **science of oats**. Oats are packed with **beta-glucan**, a type of **soluble fiber** that helps slow down digestion. This, in turn, can lead to feeling fuller for longer, which is why oats are often touted as a great food for weight management.
    
    - **Beta-glucan** in oats turns into a gel-like substance in your gut. This **slows nutrient absorption** and helps to keep **blood sugar levels stable**.
    - Stable blood sugar levels prevent **mid-morning crashes** that make you reach for snacks.
    - Keep in mind**, Oats alone** won‚Äôt cause rapid weight loss‚Äîthey‚Äôre just one part of the solution.
    - Don‚Äôt expect a fortnight miracle‚ÄîOatzempic isn‚Äôt a magic pill for weight loss. The key to success is **consistency** and fitting Oatzempic into a **balanced, sustainable approach** to weight management.
    - **Oats are healthy and filling**, making them a helpful part of a weight loss plan, especially when replacing high-calorie breakfasts.
    - **Unlike Ozempic**, which alters hormonal signals to control hunger, **Oatzempic** **works purely through fiber.**
    
    ## Does Oatzempic Work for Weight Loss?
    
    ### **Caloric Deficit Theory : how it might help?**
    
    If you‚Äôre familiar with weight loss, you‚Äôve probably heard of **CICO** (Calories In, Calories Out). The idea is simple: if you eat fewer calories than you burn, you‚Äôll lose weight. **Oatzempic** fits into this because it‚Äôs a **low-calorie** option that can help you reduce your overall intake. Replacing a high-calorie breakfast with this oat drink could help you stay in a caloric deficit, which is the foundation for weight loss. However, the drink alone isn‚Äôt going to do the heavy lifting‚Äîyou still need to **manage your overall calorie intake**.
    
    ### **Potential Benefits**
    
    By swapping your usual breakfast (think bagels, cereal, or sugary coffee) with **Oatzempic**, you could cut hundreds of calories out of your daily diet. Since oats are high in fiber, they can help keep you full for longer and prevent mid-morning snacking. Maintaining a calorie deficit along with this drink might give you the edge to shed a few pounds..
    
    ### **Expert Opinions**
    
    Many nutritionists agree that while **Oatzempic** might help with weight loss, it‚Äôs not a magic bullet. Experts like registered dietitian **Caroline Thomason** caution that relying on meal replacements like Oatzempic isn‚Äôt sustainable in the long run. She stresses that **balanced, long-term eating habits** are the key to keeping weight off, rather than quick-fix trends.
    
    ## Intermittent Fasting & Oatzempic
    
    ### **How Intermittent Fasting is tied to Oatzempic ?**
    
    If you‚Äôve seen the **Oatzempic challenge** on TikTok, you‚Äôve likely noticed that many people combine it with **intermittent fasting**. This is because **time-restricted eating** can reduce the number of calories you consume in a day, just like CICO.
    
    Oatzempic becomes the ""first meal"" after a 16-hour fast, and because it‚Äôs low in calories and high in fiber, it helps people stay full until their next meal.
    
    ### **Benefits of Time-Restricted Eating**
    
    **Intermittent fasting** isn‚Äôt just about skipping meals‚Äîit can change how your body uses energy. By fasting for long periods, your body switches to burning fat for fuel, which can boost weight loss. Adding **Oatzempic** as your first meal after fasting can help control hunger and prevent you from overeating later in the day.
    
    ## Risks and Downsides of the Oatzempic Diet
    
    ### **Unsustainable for Long-Term Weight Loss**
    
    When considering, to use **Oatzempic** as a meal replacement, you should know that these kinds of diets are rarely sustainable in the long run. While replacing a meal with a low-calorie drink can help you cut calories initially, over time, most people find it hard to stick to such limited choices. **Long-term weight loss** requires more than just quick fixes‚Äîit's about adopting habits that you can maintain over time.
    
    ### **Potential Nutritional Deficiencies**
    
    By relying on **Oatzempic** as a regular meal replacement, you might miss out on key nutrients. Oats are great for fiber, but they lack important elements like **protein**, healthy fats, and some vitamins and minerals. Over time, this could lead to **nutritional deficiencies** that can affect your overall health, energy levels, and even your ability to lose weight effectively.
    
    ### **Calorie Restriction Risks**
    
    Another major downside of highly **calorie-restrictive diets** is the risk of binging. When you drastically cut calories or restrict your meals too much, your body often reacts by triggering intense cravings. This can lead to **overeating** later in the day, undoing the progress you‚Äôve made. A more **balanced approach** to eating tends to be more effective for sustainable weight loss.
    
    ## Social Media Influence on Diet Trends
    
    ### **The Role of TikTok in Promoting Diets**
    
    If you spend time on **TikTok**, you‚Äôve probably noticed how fast diet trends like **Oatzempic** go viral. These platforms can quickly amplify ideas that promise **fast results**, even if they‚Äôre not backed by science. While TikTok is great for entertainment, it‚Äôs not always the best source for **nutrition advice**. Often, creators aren‚Äôt dietitians, and their content may be more about gaining followers than providing sound advice.
    
    ### **Critical Thinking is necessary**
    
    It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in the excitement of a **new diet trend**, but it‚Äôs important to **think critically** before jumping in. Ask yourself: Is there real science behind this? Will this diet be **sustainable** for me? Most importantly, does it fit into a **balanced, healthy lifestyle**?
    
    Viral trends can sometimes lead to **unrealistic expectations** and even harmful results, so it‚Äôs crucial to approach these ideas with caution. Always research thoroughly, and if in doubt, consult with a **registered dietitian** before making major changes to your diet.
    
    ##
    
    ## Alternative Ways to Incorporate Oats for Health
    
    ### **Healthier Oatmeal Options**
    
    If you‚Äôre looking to make your oatmeal more balanced, consider adding **protein**, **healthy fats**, and **complex carbohydrates**.
    
    - A great example is cooking oats with almond milk, topping it with **nut butter**, chia seeds, and fresh berries.
    - You can even mix in **Greek yogurt** or a scoop of **protein powder** for added protein. This combination helps keep you full longer and provides a steady release of energy throughout the day.
    
    ### **Overnight Oats or Traditional Oatmeal**
    
    For convenience, you can try **overnight oats**, which you prepare the night before. Mix oats, almond milk, chia seeds, and your favorite fruits in a jar and let it sit in the fridge. By morning, you have a delicious, ready-to-eat breakfast. For a warm option, go with **traditional oatmeal**, and spice it up with cinnamon, nuts, or fruit to keep it interesting and satisfying.
    
    ## Is Oatzempic Worth Trying?
    
    Many of the weight loss results, people rave about likely come from the fact that they are replacing a higher-calorie meal with this low-calorie alternative. The oats can provide fiber and help you feel fuller, but long-term weight loss requires more than just a single drink or diet trend. So, you will find that meal replacement trends often lose their appeal quickly.
    
    It‚Äôs all about **consistency** and overall habits. For **sustainable weight loss**, focus on a diet rich in **whole foods** like fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and healthy fats.
    
    **Oatzempic** can be a helpful tool if you‚Äôre looking to reduce calories. **Oatzempic can be part of the plan**, but don‚Äôt forget the importance of a well-rounded diet. Stick to a balanced diet.",1,1729764054.0,HealthTrendz,0,1.0,False

1gayv1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1gayv1y/recipe_and_grind_based_on_roast_process/,Recipe and Grind Based on Roast Process,"I've been curious if there are recommendations on changing your grind size or recipe (I am a Switch user) based on the roast type (washed, natural, honey, anaerobic, etc). I have seen some info online about changing based on bean origin but not much on roast process. So I asked ChatGPT to give me a break down and I correlated the info. Tell me what you think, would change, add, remove:

**Pour Over by Roast Process**  
**Washed Process Beans**

Washed coffees are known for their clean and bright flavor profile, often with higher acidity and delicate fruity notes. To bring out these qualities:

* recipes often **emphasize shorter immersion times and precise temperature control** to highlight these characteristics.
* Use a **full percolation** method with a finer grind size, which promotes clarity and high acidity.
* Tetsu Kasuya‚Äôs 4:6 method, which balances sweetness and acidity by splitting water additions.¬†
* Tetsu Kasuya's **""Devil's Recipe""** for the Hario Switch, for instance, uses a combination of high (90‚Äì95¬∞C) and low (70¬∞C) water temperatures to emphasize sweetness and clarity. ([Outpost Coffee Roasters](https://outpostcoffee.com/blogs/brew-at-home/tetsu-kasuyas-hario-switch-recipe-for-perfect-coffee))
* For washed beans, focus on faster, controlled pours to enhance acidity and clarity ([NORMCORE COFFEE](https://normcorecoffee.com.au/blogs/brew-guide/tetsu-kasuyas-hario-switch-recipe-for-perfect-coffee)).
* **Grind size**: Medium-fine (slightly finer than for honey and anaerobic).
* **Reasoning**: Washed coffees tend to have a cleaner and brighter profile, so a medium-fine grind helps to balance acidity while pulling out subtle sweetness. This finer grind also slows down extraction, allowing more sugars to be dissolved without overemphasizing acidity.

**Natural Processed Beans**

Natural processed beans often have intense fruity and berry-like notes, with a heavier body.

* A **hybrid approach** using both immersion and percolation methods can be ideal for showcasing these qualities. Start with percolation to highlight acidity, then finish with immersion to bring out the full-bodied sweetness ([Basic Barista](https://thebasicbarista.com/blogs/topics/4-recipes-to-try-on-your-hario-v60-switch-dripper)).
* A slower brew and slightly coarser grind can help enhance the natural fruit notes without overwhelming the cup with heaviness.
* **Immersion Bloom**: 96¬∞C This approach works particularly well with naturally processed beans because it emphasizes their fruit-forward and sweet characteristics
* **Agitation and Pouring Technique:** Heavy agitation at the start helps extract fruitier notes by ensuring that the grounds are evenly saturated, while minimal agitation toward the end preserves clarity. grind is medium-fine, and the water should be poured in stages, starting with an initial bloom of about 100g of water for 30-40 seconds, followed by incremental pours¬†
* **Lower Brewing Temperatures:** For naturally processed beans, **slightly cooler brewing temperatures (around 92-94¬∞C) can prevent over-extraction** and allow the natural fruit sweetness to shine. If your beans are light or medium roast, the **cooling bloom technique** (starting with high-temperature water and lowering it mid-brew) can further enhance those fruity, complex flavors¬†
   * **Ryan Wibawa Double Immersion**¬†

**Honey Processed Beans**

Honey-processed coffees typically have a balance between fruitiness and body, offering both sweetness and clarity.

* Opt for a balanced brew by using **medium grind size and alternating between immersion and percolation.** A slight **focus on immersion at the end** helps to develop a deeper body while retaining fruity sweetness ([Basic Barista](https://thebasicbarista.com/blogs/topics/4-recipes-to-try-on-your-hario-v60-switch-dripper)).
* **benefit from a longer immersion or multi-phase technique** to unlock their depth. Ryan Wibawa's recipe for the Hario Switch uses a double immersion approach
* **Reasoning**: Honey-processed coffees tend to have a more complex body and sweeter tones, so a medium grind is ideal. It offers a balanced extraction, enhancing sweetness without losing clarity. You may need to tweak slightly finer if the sweetness is not prominent enough or coarser if it's over-extracted.

**Anaerobic Processed Beans**

Anaerobic fermentation brings out more complex, intense, and sometimes wine-like fruity flavors.

* A **more aggressive immersion method** can help to accentuate these bold flavors. Keeping the valve closed longer (full immersion) allows for more intense flavor extraction (Devil's Recipe).
* Consider **lowering the water temperature slightly** to mellow out some of the overpowering fermentation notes, allowing the fruit to come through cleanly.
* **Grind size**: Medium-coarse.
* **Reasoning**: Anaerobic processed coffees often have intense fruit and sweetness. A medium-coarse grind helps prevent over-extraction of the more complex, sometimes fermented notes, letting the natural fruity sweetness shine through without overwhelming the cup. A coarser grind allows for a slower extraction, keeping the flavors balanced and avoiding muddled tastes.

**Honey Anaerobic Processed Beans**

Honey anaerobic coffees offer the sweetness of honey processing with the complexity of anaerobic fermentation.

* Use a **hybrid method** with a focus on the first percolation step to showcase acidity, followed by immersion to balance sweetness and body. This will help maintain clarity while enhancing the layered complexity ([Basic Barista](https://thebasicbarista.com/blogs/topics/4-recipes-to-try-on-your-hario-v60-switch-dripper)) ([NORMCORE COFFEE](https://normcorecoffee.com.au/blogs/brew-guide/tetsu-kasuyas-hario-switch-recipe-for-perfect-coffee)).

**In summary:**

* **Washed Process**: Focus on balanced, shorter extractions with cooler water in the second phase to accentuate clarity and acidity.

‚Ä¢	**Anaerobic/Honey Process**: Use longer immersion with varied water temperatures to bring out deep sweetness and complex fruit tones.

Is sweetener overall considered okay? I know it can have interaction with insulin despite having no calories, so could interfere with ketosis? I rely heavily on coffee (caf and decaf) for the morning hunger, and ofc no milk, but if I can't have it sweetened I'm gonna STRUGGLE...

1gayp42,https://i.redd.it/y70zmgn4dowd1.png,Is Public WiFi Safe? ,"Who doesn‚Äôt enjoy sipping a cappuccino in a quiet coffee shop while browsing or working on free Wi-Fi? I certainly do! 

But not everyone who loves that peaceful setting has good intentions. What do I mean? 

Let me explain: 
Public Wi-Fi in places like coffee shops, airports, or hotels is a goldmine for hackers, ISPs, and websites. 

They can intercept your personal information, such as: 
-passwords, 
-credit card details, 
-and emails. 

They can track your online activity, gather data on the sites you:
- visit, 
-your search history, 
-and even your shopping habits. 

So, how do you protect yourself? It‚Äôs simple! Get a VPN!

A VPN masks your IP address and encrypts your online traffic, keeping hackers, ISPs, and websites from accessing your data.

Don't leave your online security to chance. Try a VPN like SURFSHARK ONE Today!

1gayhah,https://i.redd.it/takwa29aaowd1.jpeg,Let‚Äôs Get Pixel Perfect: The Quest for the Ideal Logo Resolution!,"Alright, folks, gather ‚Äòround because today we‚Äôre talking about something near and dear to every designer's heart: animated logos. Specifically, what‚Äôs the ideal resolution for your fancy animated logo? Yeah, I know‚Äîriveting stuff. But stick with me, because if you‚Äôve ever seen a logo so pixelated that it looked like it was drawn by a toddler with a box of crayons, you‚Äôll want to hear this!


---

""Size Does Matter (When It Comes to Pixels)""

Let‚Äôs get this out of the way: size absolutely matters‚Äîespecially when we‚Äôre talking about logos. Too small, and your logo looks like it's auditioning for a role in Minecraft. Too large, and you‚Äôre wasting bandwidth like it‚Äôs a clearance sale on the internet. The sweet spot? Well, for most web use, you're looking at 1080p, my friends. That‚Äôs 1920x1080 pixels of crisp, clean, animation goodness. Your logo deserves to be seen in HD‚Äîit's not a blurry UFO in a conspiracy theory video.


---

""Why Stop at 1080p? Let‚Äôs Talk 4K!""

Now, if you‚Äôre feeling fancy‚Äîlike, really fancy‚Äîyou could go all-in with 4K. That‚Äôs right, 3840x2160 pixels, baby! It‚Äôs like giving your logo a high-end spa treatment. Every detail is crystal clear, and your logo looks so sharp it could slice through the screen. But here‚Äôs the catch: do you really need 4K for your animated logo, or are you just flexing? Unless you‚Äôre showing off your logo on billboards or hosting an animated logo film festival, 1080p is usually more than enough to keep things looking pro without slowing down load times.


---

""The Tiny but Mighty Logo: Thumbnail Edition""

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the opposite problem: when your animated logo needs to fit into something like a YouTube thumbnail or a favicon. Suddenly, all those gorgeous details and smooth animations? Yeah, gone. You‚Äôre working with, like, 32x32 pixels. It‚Äôs like trying to squeeze an elephant into a Smart car. The key here is simplicity, people. Less is more. You want that logo to be recognizable even at the size of a postage stamp. No glitter, no crazy transitions‚Äîjust pure, minimalist glory.


---

""Resolution Versus File Size: The Battle of the Bytes""

Here‚Äôs where things get tricky‚Äîresolution versus file size. Sure, you want your logo to look as stunning as a blockbuster movie, but do you really want your visitors waiting for a 10MB logo to load? I didn‚Äôt think so. The ideal resolution is one that balances quality with speed. Think of it like pizza: you want a slice big enough to enjoy but not so big that you regret it halfway through. And remember, formats like SVG can scale beautifully without losing quality. It‚Äôs like having an all-you-can-eat buffet for your logo!


---

""The Golden Rule: Know Thy Platform""

Before you start cranking out 4K logos like you‚Äôre Pixar, ask yourself: Where‚Äôs this thing going to live? Social media? Website? Digital ads? Each platform has its own recommended resolution, and what works on your website might look like a hot mess on Instagram. Pro tip: make multiple versions of your animated logo to suit the needs of each platform. You wouldn‚Äôt wear the same outfit to the gym as you would to a wedding, right? Same rule applies here.


---

""In Conclusion: Aim High but Stay Practical""

So, what‚Äôs the ideal resolution for an animated logo? Well, my friends, it‚Äôs all about context. 1080p is the safe bet for most uses, but if you‚Äôre going for that retina-searing 4K glory, just make sure your website isn‚Äôt still loading by the time your visitor‚Äôs coffee goes cold. The goal is simple: let your animated logo dazzle without turning into a pixelated mess or a loading screen nightmare. Now go forth, and may your logos be ever crisp, clear, and captivating!

1gaygiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1gaygiq/transforming_outdoor_spaces_best_tables_for/,Transforming Outdoor Spaces: Best Tables for Patios and Gardens,"As outdoor living continues to gain popularity, creating a comfortable and stylish patio or garden space has become essential for many homeowners. The right outdoor table can make all the difference, whether you're designing a cozy spot for morning coffee, hosting a summer dinner party, or simply creating a serene escape from daily life. In this post, we'll explore some of the best tables for patios and gardens, featuring different materials and styles, such as [rattan coffee tables](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/ava-rattan-coffee-table), black coffee tables, and metal tables, to help you create the perfect outdoor space.

 **1. Rattan Coffee Table: Perfect for a Relaxed, Natural Look**

Rattan is a popular choice for outdoor furniture due to its lightweight, durable, and eco-friendly qualities. A rattan coffee table can bring a touch of natural elegance to your patio or garden, blending seamlessly with lush greenery and soft outdoor textiles. The woven texture adds warmth and a casual, beachy vibe that‚Äôs perfect for laid-back settings. 

**Why Choose a Rattan Coffee Table?**

Weather-resistant: Many rattan coffee tables are designed to withstand the elements, making them perfect for outdoor use.

Versatile design: Rattan complements a range of outdoor d√©cor styles, from rustic to contemporary.

Lightweight and portable: Easy to move around, a rattan coffee table is perfect for changing the layout of your outdoor space whenever you desire.

Pair your rattan coffee table with outdoor cushions and throws to create a cozy space where you can enjoy your morning cup of coffee or a good book in the fresh air.

**2. Black Coffee Table: Sleek and Modern Outdoor Elegance**

For those looking to add a touch of sophistication to their patio or garden, a black coffee table is an excellent choice. Its bold, neutral tone works well with a variety of outdoor furniture styles, from minimalist to industrial, and it provides a striking contrast to natural surroundings. 

**Benefits of a Black Coffee Table:**

Timeless appeal: Black is a classic color that never goes out of style, and it pairs well with almost any other color or texture in your outdoor space.

Durability: Many [black coffee tables](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/lucas-black-coffee-table) are made from sturdy materials like wood, metal, or composite, ensuring they can withstand outdoor conditions while maintaining their sleek look.

Elegant focus: A black coffee table can serve as a focal point in your outdoor space, adding a layer of modernity and polish to your design.

Place a black coffee table in the center of your seating area, surrounded by comfortable outdoor chairs or a sectional. To soften the look, accessorize with vibrant outdoor plants, colorful cushions, or lanterns for evening ambiance.

**3. Metal Table: Durable and Versatile for Any Outdoor Setting**

A metal table is one of the most durable options for outdoor furniture, making it ideal for patios and gardens that face exposure to various weather conditions. Whether you opt for aluminum, steel, or wrought iron, metal tables are built to last and can bring a contemporary, industrial feel to your outdoor space.

**Why Choose a Metal Table?**

Weather-resistant: Metal tables are typically rust-resistant and designed to handle sun, rain, and even snow, ensuring they last for years with minimal upkeep.

Versatility: Metal tables come in various shapes and sizes, from sleek, minimalist designs to more ornate, decorative options, making it easy to find a style that fits your outdoor aesthetic.

Easy to clean: Metal tables are low-maintenance and can be cleaned quickly with a damp cloth, making them perfect for busy households or outdoor spaces that see a lot of use.

A metal table works well in both large and small outdoor spaces. For a chic dining area, pair a larger metal table with matching chairs and some outdoor lighting to create the perfect atmosphere for entertaining guests. For a smaller space, a compact metal side table can serve as a stylish accent, complementing your other outdoor furniture while providing a sturdy spot to place drinks or snacks.

**Tips for Choosing the Right Outdoor Table**

When selecting a table for your patio or garden, consider the following factors to ensure you pick the right one for your space:

Weather conditions: If you live in an area with heavy rain or intense sun, choose a material like metal or weather-resistant rattan that can withstand the elements.

Size of your space: For smaller patios or balconies, opt for a compact table like a rattan coffee table or a smaller black coffee table. For larger gardens, consider a bigger metal dining table that can accommodate multiple guests.

Functionality: Think about how you plan to use the table. Do you need it primarily for dining, lounging, or decoration? This will help guide your decision on the size, material, and style of the table.

Your outdoor space is an extension of your home, and the right table can help transform it into a functional, beautiful retreat. Whether you prefer the natural look of a [rattan coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/ava-rattan-coffee-table), the sleek design of a black coffee table, or the sturdy durability of a metal table, there's an outdoor table that will perfectly complement your patio or garden.

Investing in a high-quality outdoor table not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of your space but also creates a welcoming environment where you can relax, entertain, and enjoy the beauty of nature.",1,1729761836.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

I just got my teeth cleaned in Korea a little less than a month ago and noticed a dark spot on #22 right next to #23 a day or two after getting my teeth cleaned. I thought it was super strange as I never gotten any types of black stains on my teeth, so I started using crest whitening strips to try to get rid of the stains. Today when I looked in the mirror, I've gotten even more stains than a couple weeks ago and I'm super confused what's causing it (stains now on #7,8,11,22,27). I brush my teeth after every meal, floss every day, use mouthwash, so I don't even understand what is causing this all of a sudden?? I don't smoke, drink coffee, tea, etc.

Could it be caused from the teeth cleaning process where they maybe damaged my enamel? Is it maybe because Korean tap water does not have fluoride in it?

What could I do to get rid of them? TIA

  
P.S I am aware that some of my teeth have little grainy holes, but never had BLACK stains no them nor any of my teeth surface.

Yes I I know the first few months are hell. Yes I also have to say goodbye to alcohol. 
But I just realized something this morning, I also have to say goodbye to coffee. This is something I already suspected, but I just had my iced coffee 30 mins ago and the whole time my brain has been screaming at me, in the back of my throat where the taste of coffee lingers I‚Äôm missing the cigarette smoke that usually follows. I‚Äôve been combining the two for over 10 years now, in France it is almost part of the culture, the classic ¬´¬†cafe clope¬†¬ª. I could skip breakfast but never coffee and a cig.

1gay8lh,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/1gay8lh/league_relapse_starting_or_stopping_over/,League relapse... starting (or stopping) over,"I started playing League of Legends at the end of Season 2 and played until Season 5, then quit. But a few weeks ago, I started playing again, and now I'm hooked to the point where I can't focus on my work or university tasks. I thought I was done with it. I had started going hiking, mountain biking, riding motorcycles, doing photography, and going out instead of sitting in front of the PC.

Two weeks ago, I got rear-ended on my motorcycle. Thankfully, I wasn't hurt, but my bike was totaled. It might sound stupid, but that incident really threw me off. I was looking for a new bike and ended up buying one, but I realized it was a bit too expensive, and now I need to save money. I started feeling like the lifestyle I was living without gaming was to expensive. Like going every night out drinking coffee, paying for gas or buying train tickets to go to places to hike.

Around the same time, some friends started playing League of Legends, and I joined them. Since then, I haven't been able to do anything else. I'm tired of this cycle.

I asked my dear friend ChatGPT (probably because I was sitting in front of my university slides, trying to avoid starting League) for advice, but things like ""set specific gaming hours"" never worked for me. However, one suggestion I hadn't tried yet was joining a support group like r/StopGaming and posting my progress regularly. I don't know if this subreddit is really for that, but if it is, I'm ready to start now and commit to posting daily updates on my journey.

Also posting here as post was deleted In 
r/askSingapore
I am in a tech Role. 
My team of 5 is currently situated in an old office in an old building. 

We are seated side by side. 
Current our desk is extremely small! And we aren‚Äôt issued monitors by default. The desk comes with a old cabinet at the top 

My current desk can only fit the following 

1 x 22 inch extremely old Dell monitor which i ‚Äúchori-ed‚Äù; it was lying around in the office so i grabbed it, it has no other input expect VGA - that‚Äôs how old it is so i have to use converters 

1 x 22 inch old dell monitor which I purchased 2nd hand, came with a green line running across the Center of the screen, similar to the above no other input expect VGA so I have to use converters 

1 x MX Master 3 - love the mouse, but using without the Logitech application as I don‚Äôt have the admin rights to install it 

1x cheap Bluetooth full sized  mechanical keyboard, which I bought from shoppe for 40 dollars, it‚Äôs extremely tiring to type with 


That‚Äôs all my desk can fit anything more than that it will fall off the desk.

I have to put the laptop into the cabinet and run cables as such There are cables dangling here and there.

Also we don‚Äôt have a pantry, I go thru at least 3 cups of iced kopi a day, which I from the bakery nearby for 2 dollars which is served with a thick plastic cups - very costly and expensive I know, but I don‚Äôt have a pantry.

My team is being shifted to a new office. 
With a new desk and has a pantry 

My new desk, is L shaped and ‚Äúmovable‚Äù the height of it can be adjusted to a standing desk or sitting desk, it has drawers and cabinets. And has a sea view 
In my role I need a minimum of 2 monitors to do work. 3 would be great.
Since I am not provided a monitor,

I am thinking if I should reuse the 2 old monitors I already have, which in general does the job. 
(My role requires me to work mainly on a terminal so it‚Äôs blank screen with white words most of the time. )
Or purchase new ones? If I should purchase new ones, which would be a good option ? 

And I definitely need a new keyboard, which would be great for productivity? 

If my organisation allowed it, I would have went with MX keys, but Since they don‚Äôt allow it. I don‚Äôt know if that is a good choice. Hoping Logitech develops a portable version of Logitech options 


I also highly doubt the new pantry is gonna have ice, but what would be a good coffee option ?
I don‚Äôt really fancy the Nescafe 3 in 1. 
I love Bru, but bru has no kick

Yesterday, my partner and I decided to take a walk after work and tackle some administrative chores together at a caf√© rather than in our apartment, thinking that a change of environment + coffee or a sweet treat might motivate us. So, off we went with a laptop and the best of intentions, imagining which cozy caf√© would be our chosen destination. We left home around 16:45, and arrived in the city centre about 15 minutes later. We walked past a few caf√©s, and googled a few more, but all of them were either already closed at 17, or would be closing at 17:30. We sighed and went to Espresso House (aka ""ol' reliable"") - nothing against it, we actually like it and their wide selection of snacks and drinks, but it left me with a bad taste in my mouth, as I was imagining something cozier, and I liked the idea of supporting an independently owned caf√© over a big chain. 
So, do you have any recommendations for my partner and I, if we wanted to go out on another ""cozy get-shit-done"" date? We actually enjoyed it, even at Espresso House, but I'd be interested in more suggestions.

The requirements would be:
- is open after 16:30 (and ideally until after 18, but I'm trying to be realistic)
- is appropriate to have a laptop on the table, and perhaps has a power outlet somewhere accessible
- bonus points if it serves soy/oat milk and has some vegan snacks available",0,1729759992.0,Aalborg,0,0.5,False

Charles had feelings for Karen:

1. In the second and third chapters, you can measure how Karen drinks coffee in the morning near the camp kettle, usually in the company of Mary-Beth. Always, if Karen is there, Charles comes too (never the other way around). He always stands next to her, and not someone else, and between them there are comments about coffee. Once Karen said that it is better not to approach her until she has drunk coffee in the morning. In this scene, Charles does not take his eyes off the girl and simply devours her with his gaze while standing there.

2. Sean's party.
Everyone is relaxing, only Charles is missing, who is standing guard. It makes sense, because something has to be guarding, but what if the reason is different? It's hard to watch the girl you like sitting on Sean's lap and spending time with him.

3. The next morning, when Sean and Karen are sorting things out, Karen yells at Sean. Charles always passes nearby during this dialogue (not right next to him) and says to himself ""I know that feeling"". At first I thought his phrase was not related to the dialogue, but on the second playthrough everything repeated itself and the theory was confirmed.


4. and lastly, in chapter 2 after Sean's party Charles is very sad and distant (as always, but here it's different), he tells Arthur that he's not the best conversationalist now if you approach him and tries to distance himself from the conversation. Maybe this fact is too far-fetched, but I see a temporal connection between Sean's party and Charles' mood.

I'd really appreciate if someone took their time and at least found some useful information to direct me, even if it's just one or two positions it would help tremendously.

Okay so I firstly wanna apologize, this is going to be a long one on the account of my inability to condense information, I just keep expanding more and more but I did try.

Now I firstly wanna say, yes I took the test because I've seen someone ask that under typing posts, but it wasn't very frutiful, I've gotten anything from inconsistent, if believeable results to stuff like 1V which I feel is extremely unlikely at the very least (I'd say impossible for me but I'm here to learn so I can't make statements).

Now I did familiarize myself with the system a bit but I do have trouble sorting information I learn but if I had to say I'd imagine it like this:

Feel free to discrad this part naturally because I'm not well enough informed so these are just my guesses.

E - I'd say either 1 or 2 because I'm fairly confident in my emotions

L - I could see being 3 or 4, I am very skeptical and question all information coming my way so I was leaning towards 3 but I'm not totally unreceptive towards outside information (even though I never just accept it at face value), also I do care a lot about being right and about truth somewhat so idk

V - I'd say 3 could be possible because I'm pretty non-conformist and certainly not a planner but at the same time I do feel like my volition fluctuates a bit.

F - 3 was my first guess here because I'm insecure about finances and go between ignoring my health and hypochodria and also don't very much like advice on health but at the same time though bit insecure about my looks I don't focus on them let alone overcomepsate for them. I also don't feel like 4F because I do value material possesions.

I'm honestly bit confused because I don't feel these come as clear others/self positive/negative, especially logic but I was trying to answer the questions genuenly, I feel like if I focused on trying to make it theoretical I'd probably run into the trap of showing myself into boxes right away. Anyway if I had to guess I'd say ExxL but could see ExLx, maybe even something else.

Again sorry for this being long and thanks if you took the time, I appreciate it.

**L (logic)**

* **How much time and energy do you spend researching or studying? Do you like researching and studying, and why?**

I've always spent minimal time and energy studying, I always do it on the last moment and prioritize pinpointing the most important/useful concepts in the text and being able to understand them and expand on them over actually trying too hard to study and memorize.

Regarding research, if it is something that interests me I can do it, I enjoy learning new stuff certainly and exploring new topics is fun, it's magical to learn about something I don't have wholistic understanding of. That said you won't catch me reading studies or anything, I'm not that into research.

I do verify information though if that counts, usually from multiple sources and comparing them to eachother, looking for consensus or looking for holes in consensus. I never just believe anything at face value and I'm quite proud of that.

* **How many of your own opinions do you form? How often do you do actual thinking on your own, more than just finding an existing answer?**

I can form quite a few opinions based on my own observations, those are usually the more philosophical ones and related to people, I do so based on my own insights and experiences.

However like I already said I generally do like to consult sources when it comes to external stuff, I recognize my abilities have limits, I'm not as informed about certain stuff as some other people and likewise I can't do calculations or whatever and I understand that.

I'm also fundamentally a product of my enviroment, a subjective being, therefore I think in pursuit of truth I must reach out to other people. I feel like trusting yourself too much on what you think is a trap.

However there is always element of indepdent/critical thinking involved in this process, I may ask for explanation but I may try to point out inconsistencies, ask for nuances. I never just adopt opinions of other people at face value, I am very careful what I trust and always strive to think indepdently.

* **How often do you talk about concepts or facts? Why exactly do you talk about it, and what do you like talking about most?**

I do like talking about concepts quite a bit, the most mundane things and situations can inspire me to come up with them and I find it interesting. I also like to talk about my conclusions from external world and discuss concepts like that sometimes. As for facts, I only do so to disprove what other people are saying, not in actual arguments though, I dislike arguments, so from distance.

Why do I talk about that? Well I feel like when I come up with something or come to a conclusion I feel the need to share it and explore it. I never actually care to convince other people though, so I will only debate it with open-minded people I respect.

* **Do you struggle with thinking about things by yourself? Does this bother you, and how much? How well do you handle criticism from others when it comes to your logical concepts or factual knowledge?**

I do not neccesarily struggle to think as much as to stay informed, I don't put enough effort and perhaps I'm not smart enough to understand lot of things, it really depends, certain things are my domain and I can be confident in my thoughts in that area but certain things are not, I'd say I'm generally less confident in this stuff in general.

When it comes to criticism, well if I make a mistake and someone corrects me I ask for a source and if it is legitiamte I will correct myself without any issue (if not I refuse to take stance at all rather than make something up). When it comes to making big mistakes I usually avoid making these in the first place, either by not arguing ab something I don't understand or just preparing myself well enough.

* **Did you enjoy answering the above questions? Would you say this is a major part of who you are or your identity? Was it boring? Is it a difficult topic?**

Yeah, I do think it's very interesting. I don't think I'm good in logic but also that I have a lot to say about it. I'm honestly really stuck here because I feel like I rely on outside sources too much to be 3L but also am too skeptical to be 4L so I'm not sure, I hope something useful can be learned here.

And yeah I'd say I care a lot about logic, I care a lot about correctness of information and I judge people who are confidently ignorant.

**E (emotion)**

* **Do you consider yourself a creative person? What do you do that's creative?**

Yes very much so, mostly when it comes to writing or coming up with ideas I can be very creative. I've had many ideas for stories, I've writen lyrics and poetry and generally I'm quick to inspire and have pretty easy time coming up with ideas. It's not neccesarily always super deep and symbolic but I'd still say creativity is one of my stronger sides.

Generally I'd say this is so big for me that I'd like to engage in creative pursuits as my main objective in life and for me Uni is mostly just ""safety net"". Ideally I'd like to be something like a director but that's not really feasible so more realistically I'd aspire to be a writer.

* **How do you feel about expressing your own emotions? Are emotions part of your decision-making at all? How much of a role do they play in your decisions?**

I'm a very emotional person though not neccesarily emotionally expressive. I have good idea of my emotions usually and I have good ammount of control over them. I generally have little trouble expressing most emotions and do so in a measured way. I mostly express positive emotions like enthusiasm and may hide some emotions more. Though even sad emotions I prefer to express sometimes. Sometimes I even want people to see me sad honestly, as silly as that sounds and I don't really want to hide it, though I can be quite private as well.

Regarding decisionmaking, yes I'd actually say emotions are my private motivator, for me it is important for a decision to ""feel right"" though they need to be supported by rationale too, rationale is subordinated to emotions and I can't break this.

Sometimes it can happen that I can have conflicting emotions though, usually I come to a decision but worth mentioning I think.

* **How much effort do you put into creating a positive emotional influence on other people? Do you try to do this at all? Do you like exploring the emotions or creativity of others?**

Honestly, while yes I can be the ""therapist friend"" and I do enjoy it quite a bit and I do enjoy motivating my friends too, I generally don't go out of my way to emotionally influence people. My emotions are for me and it can get quite exhausting, even unnatural to deal with emotions of others, especially strong, unsolicited emotions.

* **Do you feel uncomfortable with the idea of sharing your emotions? Do you struggle with knowing exactly how to connect with others on a deeper and more emotional level? Do you struggle with knowing how to go about dealing with and handling your emotions?**

It depends, I can appear either very stoic or very emotionaly expressive, generally though I want people to know how I feel even if I may not act on it and what I stand for, almost at all times. I can sometimes have trouble with some difficult past stuff but generally I can share most emotions quite easily, though I do so in controlled way.

I think it's quite the opposite, I can connect with people on deeper level easily but may have problem with the ""warming up"" and the rituals inbetween. I do however overall have easy time to sympathize with people, though again I don't want to do it at all times.

I don't really know how to answer that honestly, when something bad happens, I may be emotionaly overhwelmed, sometimes it can even be crippling if it's too strong, however I generally try to keep my emotions on a leash.

* **Did you enjoy answering the above questions? Would you say this is a major part of who you are or your identity? Was it boring? Is it a difficult topic?**

This is a big part of my identity yes, I'd say that my emotions are area of confidence for me, though I'm not sure if I did a good job at describing them, feels bit contradictory at times.

**F (physics / foundation)**

* **How much time and energy do you put into your physical health? Do you try new healthcare or self-care products often? How often, and what kinds of products do you like trying?**

It's actually very heavy fluctuation, I can go between knowing and feeling my health problems but ignoring them, straight into fits of hypochodria. I will give an example from time I was younger.

I had this one period for a while where I drank soda way too often, of course I wouldn't want anyone to intrude on it or critize it but I did do it a lot. Now at some point I realised it is a lot and suddenly due to some (completely unrelated) minor health issue, I started believing that I messed up my blood sugar and started panicking and spent like next 4 months running from doctor to doctor, misdiagnosing myself with almost every ilness I could find.

Now I turned out to be fine but the point is, as you can see I was quite fine with having unhealthy lifestyle but at the same time it also cuased me considerable stress.

* **How much do you care about your physical appearance, including fashion choices, or decorating the physical environment for comfort? Do you like exploring the physical environment (food, nature, architecture, etc), or doing physical activity?**

Well I don't consider myself good looking (not everyone would agree with that but it's my perspective) and if someone asked me to send them a picture of me I would be too insecure but generally I don't spend too much time thinking about it. Of course I'd like to be attractive and I feel good when people find me attractive but I don't put much work into it in all honestly.

Regarding fashion choices, I'm oblivious to mainstream fashion, I wear clothes that are comfortable and reflect certain perception of me I want to create. As an example I like wearing sweaters because they're comfortable, make me look slightly less skinny and make me come off as a ""casual""/""easy-going"" person, I also like to wear coats because I think they look nice and elegant. I don't spend too much time thinking about clothing though.

Regarding food, I find it to be quite mundane topic, I mostly eat for sustinence, more or less at least 2 meals a day, however even then I do have my tastes and I'd rather have lunch that tastes good than not. I'm very conservative in my tastes and could eat the same few foods a lot. I also have my dislikes, like I can't tolerate too much sweets, especially chocolate.

I do also indulge in some other comforts, I smoke cigars occasionaly, I like warm baths and I always like to be drinking something, be it coffee, tea or something else basically at all times, so I certainly care a bit yes. I like my home too, it's nice and comfortable and warm.

Regarding architecture and nature, yes I do find beauty in them, I don't exactly comprehend how or why I feel that way but I do see physical beauty. I also really like the connection between aesthetics and comfort and atmosphere in general.

* **Do you like talking about your personal tastes often? How often do you explore the personal tastes of others? What about your own health or the health of others? Do you like creating or exploring comfortable environments with others?**

I feel like personal tastes are kinda pointless topic because everyone likes something different, I can't borrow your taste buds and you can't borrow mine, so there's not much to talk about. I do it sometimes as small talk though but to me my tastes are mostly to be taken as a quirk rather than something to share.

I don't really care about personal tastes of others, when it comes to their health I may have picked bit of advice here and there but ultimately I don't like intruding upon other people, let them take care of themselves.

* **Do you stress about what people will think regarding your personal tastes? Do you prefer to follow fashion trends in worry that people may judge your own style? Do you worry about being sick or in poor physical health often? Are you able to take criticism about your health, aesthetic choices, personal tastes, or physical appearance?**

Uh well, I certainly would find it annoying if someone criticized my personal tastes or health, it's not neccesarily that I'm insecure though, it's just nobody's business and I am annoyed by people who try to impose upon others or search for superiority in most mundane things. And again like I said I really don't care about fashion trends either.

Regarding physical health, I also already mentioned it, I either ignore it or obsess over it.

* **Did you enjoy answering the above questions? Would you say this is a major part of who you are or your identity? Was it boring? Is it a difficult topic?**

I'm not sure, it's always so confusing to me, I feel like comfort-seeking plays a large part in my life but I also feel detached from physical enviroments so physicality/sensory in typology systems always confuses me.

**V (volition)**

* **Do you know how to get what you want? How much effort do you put into figuring out how to get what you want? Do you just take action and get started, do you plan, do you research or try to get advice from others?**

I find this question quite puzzling honestly, I don't think I usually conceptualize ""what I want"" at all. Sure there are times, like when seeking relationships I could be persistent and even competetive but in my natural state I think I mostly just flow through things and navigate them as they come.

Regarding taking action, yes I usually like to but the problem is I'm very indecisive, it's actually quite stresfull for me because I want to decide as fast as possible but at the same time I often just don't know what option to choose or what's better, in such situations I would probably seek advice, not neccesarily to convince me but to push me into making a stance for or against something.

* **How often do you feel motivated to work on your future? How often are you busy working on a goal for the future? Do you prefer routine, or often fall into routine? Is your routine making progress on a goal? What makes you change your routine? What makes you start working on a goal?**

I mostly am either indifferent or experience spikes of motivation upon being inspired by something but overall for the most part I don't really actively work on fullfilling some sort of long term plan, that has never been my thing ever.

I don't really think either statement about routine applies, I never make schedules or plan out my time, nor do I want to conform to outside routine, both seem like pretty depressing choices.

As for what makes me wanna start working on a goal, again it's inspiration, something inspires me and imprints concept into my head and I start to work on that, usually doesn't last enough for me to finish it though.

* **Do you like guiding or helping people reach their goals? What kinds of goals do you prefer to help people with? Are you a leader, or do you prefer to work in groups where you're an equal? How and when do you take charge, if ever?**

Yeah I think I like motivating people, not over the top but somewhat, I also get somewhat frustrated seeing people who do nothing to work on their goals, though I'm not particurarily competent in this area either I suppose.

When it comes to working in groups, I like to take leadership but not by dominance, I'm averse to forcing people into stuff, even convincing people is out of question for me, I want people to do what they will, however I like to assume responsibility for a bit sometimes nd help us put together somethign that works best for everyone,

* **Do you overwork yourself? Do you worry that you might be lazy or that you aren't progressing quickly enough? Does it feel impossible to find the right method forward? Are you able to take criticism over your choices for working towards your goals? How do you respond to being challenged?**

Not usually, if anything I tend to prefer doing bare minimum, unless I'm absolutely immersed in whatever I'm doing. And yeah I suppose I do worry about that, it's not an active worry but with time I realise I haven't done enough for my goals and I never finish anything which makes me worried about being able to secure the future I desire.

Finding right methods doesn't feel impossible but I dislike anything that requires too much logistics, like I see people who are capable of going out of their way to go ""into the field"" and even do experiments or stuff that requires significant mobilization for something as stupid as an essay (I don't have an example rn), while I myself just would rather do a conventional essay with as little actual activity outside of reading as possible.

I really don't think I'd be a huge fan of criticism in this area, like I don't want to be criticized for productivity or my dreams for sure but I don't feel strong reaction when thinking about this, at least not rn.

If I was challenged, depends on what way, I'd probably just assert myself to be left alone, I don't need to convince other people or impose upon them but I don't want to be imposed upon either.

* **Did you enjoy answering the above questions? Would you say this is a major part of who you are or your identity? Was it boring? Is it a difficult topic?**

I'm not sure, I don't think I really got to the core of what I feel like I should've covered, especially my aversion to people trying to push against me, which I think is a part of this entire thing so I don't quite know.

1gaxxks,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1gaxxks/is_it_worth_walking_2_miles_for_mcdonalds_food/,Is it worth walking 2 miles for McDonald's food?,"So I have a physical illness that prevents me from being too active for parts of the year, during this time I'll sleep 11+ hours, wake up in the late evening afternoon, stay inside most of the day, not excercise, and barely really move. Don't have much choice in the matter unfortunately.

I try to go on small walks to keep at least some movement going, but since I typically do them at night, usually after midnight, it gets boring fast. Sometimes the motivation just isn't there to spend all that extra energy so I sit at home doing nothing instead.

Anyway, I've noticed that the only place in my town that's open at night, McDonald's, is exactly one mile from my home. I've calculated the to-and-from walk to be just around 350 calories burned, which is almost exactly the same amount of calories as most of McDonald's items. So if I were to walk there, grab a milkshake, drink it, and then walk back, the calories would theoretically cancel each other out and I'd have gotten a ""free"" walk with a nice tasty incentive.

Imagine I'm having one of those down periods and I'm sitting on my couch not wanting to move. Would going on this McDonald's run actually be beneficial in the long run? Assuming I eat/drink enough to exactly make up for the calories burned on the walk, what will have the bigger impact on my health, the movement and fresh air from going on a 2 mile walk or the sugar and fat from eating a McFlurry any time I'd do one of these walks?

Ps. I'm not saying I won't go for a walk without a literal deep fried carrot dangling in front of me on a stick, I try my best to go on semi regular walks without any incentives other than simply maintaining my body, but some days I could really need the extra motivation and I want to know if doing this would actually be a net positive or if I'd be better off staying in bed for the day

Pps. No, there isn't a conveniently placed 24 hour coffee shop or fruit basket store directly next to the McDonald's. I've checked. It's them or nothing.",1,1729759383.0,selfimprovement,11,0.6,False
1gaxx9u,https://i.redd.it/pwjue5wl2owd1.jpeg,Dialling in dark roasted beans for V60,"Hello coffee friends,
a friend of mine gave me a bag of coffee from Tanzania as a gift. I usually only drink light roasted beans and am used to dialling in beans that tend to be really hard to extract. I instantly saw that these beans would not be what I usually drink but I now see it as a challenge to brew a decent cup. 
I need your help though. This morning I brew a cup with my V60 and tried to lower the extraction by 

- a coarser grind 
- no bloom 
- brew temperature of 85 degrees 
- a lower ratio of 1:13,6
- low agitation while pouring 

With those setting I would usually get a really unpleasant sour cup of coffee. This time it was really bitter and not pleasant for my liking. At the same time I got some dark chocolate and nutty flavors that could seem some what enjoyable.

","I sat in the back of his classroom, trying to focus on the lecture but my eyes kept wandering to him. Dr. Thomas, my new psychology professor, was older, maybe in his early forties, with dark hair peppered with gray and piercing blue eyes. He was tall, broad-shouldered, and had a way of commanding the room that made me feel both intimidated and aroused.

One day after class, I worked up the nerve to approach him. ""Dr. Thomas, I was wondering if you could help me with my paper?"" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

He looked up from his desk, those blue eyes meeting mine. ""Of course, I'd be happy to help,"" he said, a small smile playing at the corners of his mouth. ""Come by my office later this week.""

I left his office feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. The day of our meeting, I found myself dressed a little nicer than usual, hoping to impress him. When I knocked on his office door, he called me in with a warm smile.

""Close the door and have a seat,"" he instructed. I did as I was told, sitting across from him. He leaned back in his chair, his eyes scanning me from head to toe. ""You look nice today,"" he commented, his voice low.

""Thank you,"" I replied, feeling a blush creep up my cheeks. ""I wanted to look presentable for you.""

He chuckled, a deep sound that sent a shiver down my spine. ""Well, it's working. Now, let's talk about your paper.""

As we discussed my project, I found myself increasingly distracted by his presence. His hand resting on the desk, the way his shirt hugged his muscular chest, the scent of his cologne‚Äîit all overwhelmed me.

""You seem distracted,"" he said, interrupting my thoughts. ""Everything okay?""

""Yes, sorry,"" I replied, trying to regain my composure. ""It's just... you're very attractive, Dr. Thomas.""

He raised an eyebrow, a hint of a smile on his lips. ""And you're very forward, Miss...""

""Call me Lily,"" I said, smiling back at him.

""Lily,"" he repeated, his voice softening. ""I find you quite attractive as well.""

I felt a rush of excitement at his words. ""Is that so?"" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

He nodded, his gaze locked onto mine. ""Yes, it is. But I'm your professor, and you're my student. We can't...""

I leaned forward, interrupting him. ""Who said anything about 'can't'?"" I whispered, my eyes flicking to his lips.

He looked at me for a moment, a mix of desire and hesitation in his eyes. Then, he stood up and walked around his desk, closing the distance between us. ""Lily,"" he said, his voice low. ""Are you sure about this?""

I nodded. ""Completely.""

He reached out, cupping my cheek in his hand. ""Then come here,"" he whispered, pulling me closer.

Our lips met in a deep, passionate kiss. His hand moved from my cheek to the back of my head, tangling in my hair as he deepened the kiss. I could taste the hint of coffee on his tongue, and I moaned softly, pressing myself closer to him.

He broke the kiss, trailing his lips down my neck, nibbling gently on my skin. ""You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that,"" he murmured, his voice hoarse.

I gasped as he bit down gently on my neck, sending a jolt of pleasure through me. ""I think you do,"" I whispered, my hand reaching up to touch his chest.

He groaned, capturing my lips in another kiss. His hand moved to my breast, squeezing gently before he moved to bite my nipple through the fabric of my shirt. I gasped, arching into him.

""Take off your shirt,"" he commanded, his voice thick with desire. I complied, pulling my shirt off and tossing it to the side. He looked at me, his eyes dark with lust. ""You're so beautiful,"" he said, his hand reaching out to cup my breast.

He leaned down, taking my nipple into his mouth, sucking hard. I moaned, my head falling back as waves of pleasure washed over me. He moved to my other nipple, biting down gently before sucking hard once more.

I could feel myself growing wet, my body aching for him. He seemed to sense it, his hand moving to my pants, unbuttoning them slowly. I lifted my hips, helping him to pull them off.

He looked at me, his eyes taking in every inch of my naked body. ""You're perfect,"" he whispered, his voice rough.

I reached out, unbuttoning his shirt. He helped me, pulling it off and tossing it aside. I ran my hands over his chest, feeling the hard muscles beneath my fingers.

He picked me up, carrying me to the couch in the corner of his office. He laid me down gently, positioning himself between my legs. He looked at me for a moment, his eyes filled with desire. ""I want to taste you,"" he said, his voice low.

I nodded, biting my lip in anticipation. He leaned down, his tongue licking a path up my thigh. I moaned, my hips bucking as he finally reached my clit, sucking it into his mouth.

I cried out, my hands fisting in his hair as he licked and sucked, driving me closer and closer to the edge. Just as I was about to come, he pulled back, a wicked smile on his face.

""Not yet,"" he said, his voice commanding. ""I want to be inside you when you come.""

He undid his pants, pushing them down along with his boxers. His cock sprang free, hard and ready. I reached out, wrapping my hand around it, stroking gently.

He groaned, leaning down to kiss me. Our bodies pressed together, I could feel the heat of his cock against my pussy. He positioned himself at my entrance, looking into my eyes as he slowly pushed inside.

""Fuck,"" he groaned, his eyes fluttering closed. ""You feel so good.""

I wrapped my legs around his waist, pulling him deeper inside me. He started to move, his hips thrusting against mine as he set a steady rhythm. I could feel every inch of him, filling me completely.

""Deeper,"" I begged, my voice hoarse. ""Faster.""

He complied, increasing his pace, his cock slamming into me with each thrust. I could feel my orgasm building, my body tensing as I got closer and closer.

""Yes,"" I cried out, my nails digging into his back. ""Right there, don't stop.""

He didn't, his cock pounding into me as he chased his own release. I could feel him getting harder, his thrusts becoming more erratic.

""I'm going to come,"" he groaned, his voice strained. ""Come with me, Lily.""

And with that, I exploded, my orgasm ripping through me as I cried out his name. He followed soon after, his cock pulsing inside me as he filled me with his cum.

We lay there for a moment, our bodies still joined, our breaths coming in ragged gasps. He pulled out of me, collapsing onto the couch beside me.

""That was incredible,"" he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

I smiled, leaning over to kiss him softly. ""It sure was,"" I replied.

As we lay there, the sun began to set, casting a warm glow over his office. We were both naked, our bodies entwined, and I knew that this was just the beginning of something amazing.",1,1729759193.0,u_Real_Button_2421,0,1.0,False

1gaxttn,https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/1gaxttn/which_of_these_biological_relatives_are/,Which of these biological relatives are surprising to you?,"I hope this is OK to post here.

I'm working on an article (maybe two, I'm thinking I should divide it into plants and animals) for my little science blog on unexpected relatives--that is, things that the average person doesn't realize are in the same biological family (I may go as high as order if something's especially surprising, but probably not as high as class).  But I am not an Average Person, so I'm not necessarily sure what things are surprising to same.

How many of the following sets did you already know were relatively close relatives?  Any sets you think I should include that aren't already on here?  Any other thoughts?  I may be particularly missing interesting animals, my background is more in plants.

Unless otherwise stated, each line represents members of the same family.

# Plants:

Cashews, mangos, poison ivy, and pistachios

Tarragon and camomile

that all of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica\_oleracea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica_oleracea) cultivars are the same species (I figure most people know that, eg, kale and broccoli and such are relatives, but not that they're the same literal species), and that horseradish is in the same family

Cannabis and hops

Carob, licorice, fenugreek, acacia and a bunch of other desert trees, alfalfa and clover, kudzu, and, well, beans.

lavender, basil, sage, rosemary, and mint

Cinnamon, bay leaves, and avocado

Marsh mallows, hibiscus, chocolate, cotton, okra, and durian

Eucalyptus, tea tree, allspice, cloves, and guavas

Cardamom and ginger

apples, apricots, blackberries, strawberries, almonds, and roses

coffee, gardenias, cinchona (the source of quinine), and Carapichea ipecacuanha (the source of ipecac)

rue, citrus, the curry tree, and Sichuan pepper

tomatoes, potatoes, chili peppers, eggplant, and tobacco

wheat and other grains, sugarcane, and bamboo

# Animals:

Wombats and koalas are in the same superfamily

Hyraxes (little rodenty-looking things), manatees, and elephants are in the same superorder.

Whales are in the same order as pigs and cows

Giraffes and okapi (they look kind of like zebra-deer crosses or something)

Weasels, otters, and wolverines (and skunks, red pandas, and raccoons are in the same superfamily)

a few other surprises in order Carnivora:  weasels are in the ""dog"" branch, while mongooses are in the ""cat"" branch.  Seals and walruses and such are also in the order (on the ""dog"" branch).  Despite many dog-like traits, hyenas are in the ""cat"" branch.

antechinus (""marsupial shrews"") and Tasmanian devils

crows and ravens, magpies, and jays

She's been my friend for about 8 years, and probably my closest friend for the last 4 or 5. It feels painful to even start writing this because I can tell how much this person means to me, but I try not to think about it on the day to day. 

We used to talk every day, currently we are hardly talking. She has some mental health issues, was even hospitalized once for them. Then she went on some meds and was sort of chill for a few years. Now off of them (with doctor's guidance) and it feels like she's changed a lot. Or our relationship has, it's hard to say.

The conflict started started a little less than a year back when I told her I felt we weren't hanging out enough. She had been living out of town and would come by to the city where I lived, but would usually not visit me. Her reasoning for this was that she was here to make money, not socialize, and that she was stressed about that. But she would hang out with her other friends, ones she was working with or doing side gigs with. My take was that if she was going to be in town for a few days overnight, we'd have time to at least go for coffee or something. We did hang out maybe once a month to every other month, but she was here weekly. For context our old routine was hanging out nearly every day.

We'd still text daily, so maybe I was being a shitty and possessive friend. I'm open to that criticism if that's what it sounds like.

Anyways, I brought up that this bugged me as it made me feel like she didn't really want to hang out as much, or that she didn't think I was cool enough to come hang with her new friends or something. She said the stuff about she was mainly here for gig work, etc but that she'd take the feedback and try to do better. All was good I thought. I forgave her, let it go.

Fast forward, she moves to a new city. We end up having an argument over the phone because I said it sounded ""dubious"" to apply for funding for art funding for the ""severely disabled."" She told me this was terrible that I'd say that, because I should understand that she is mentally unwell, etc. I told her it was just the ""severely"" part that made it sound like it wasn't for her. To me severely meant you could hardly function as a person, to which she replied that was basically her situation. It was tough for me to see I guess because she's socially very adept and had the one serious mental break in the past, but seemed to be doing quite well. She basically told me that I was wrong and she was severely disabled and that I had broken her trust by questioning her on that.

She told me that this was basically unresolvable until we could talk in person. And said it was about more than me calling it ""dubious"" to get that art funding. She brought up how I said we weren't hanging out enough, and said something about how it showed that I have privilege (was living rent free at a relatives at the time), and that's why I didn't understand her money struggles. She also said that my questioning the thing about her funding showed that I had troubling beliefs. When I asked her to clarify she said she didn't trust me to talk about it until we talked in person. This was my best friend! She was treating me like a total stranger all of a sudden. It was devastating.

Fast forward again. I'm in the same city as her (I have family there). We talk about it. I try to tell her it's really painful to leave your friend hanging on their friendship for a couple months because you suddenly can't trust them. She brings up how many other people have betrayed her recently, as justification for her treatment of me. I ask her if she feels she's projecting on me. She agrees but with some reluctance to do so initially.

A few days later that's no longer the case. It's not that I have troubling beliefs, we just have different beliefs. This is apparently why there is tension between us, according to her.

Every time I've tried to talk about resolving this tension, it gets brought back to how she is feeling stressed, drained, and on the verge of collapse essentially. So I feel rather guilty like I'm making this about me while my friend is struggling. A part of me wonders if I'm being manipulated a bit, but then I feel guilty for thinking that because if she is really struggling as much as she is saying then that's kind of callous of me.

Basically I just need some outside perspective on this given the full rundown. I'm too deep in it. I can't tell if I'm being a shitty friend, or what I'm supposed to do. I want to help my friend through her apparent crisis, but she has pushed me away as someone who is untrustworthy, essentially because other people have betrayed her, and because I doubted her intentions, and put pressure on her to hang out.

Maybe some important context: no I don't have feelings for in a romantic way. We did hook up one summer, but it was more of a fuck it, we're both horny scenario. We were pretty mature about it. At one point I wondered if maybe I had caught feelings, but I realized I just really loved her as a friend, but we would be incompatible as partners.

I feel scared to lose my friend and I've tried talking to her about it, and then I feel like I'm putting pressure on her while she's dealing with her mental health. Should I just leave her alone? Should I check on her sometimes to make sure she is ok? Am I being manipulated in this situation? I feel like I just need some feedback on this situation.

  
tl;dr best friend of over 8 years suddenly doesn't trust me, and is causing strain on our friendship. Attempts to heal it have failed, and am having difficulty seeing if I'm being inconsiderate of my friends mental health issues or my friend is being an asshole to me.",6,1729758603.0,relationships,10,0.88,False

Need advice,"My life feels like something out of a ridiculous movie, and I don‚Äôt know how the f**\***ck I ended up here. I need to make sense of it all to move on. Please help me figure this out.

So, my close childhood friend Maria (30F) had her bachelorette party this summer, where I met this woman for the first time‚Äîlet's call her Lucy (35F). Me (27F) and Lucy were both supposed to attend Maria's wedding later in the year. Lucy seemed nice. She mentioned she had three kids and a partner she'd been with for five years. She said they had an amazing relationship, that they‚Äôd had some issues in the past but now he‚Äôd been really trying for the last three months and everything was great.

Later that day, we went to a nightclub. Lucy was flirting with every guy she bumped into and as the night escalated, she ended up having sex with this random guy outside in a public place right in front of all of us. (No, she wasn‚Äôt *that* drunk.) I was shocked. But the other girls from the bachelorette party who knew Lucy weren't surprised. They said this was typical behavior for her.

The next day, on our way home, Lucy got a call from her partner, Aaron (40M). We were in the car, and the call was on speaker. He was just asking about what to get for dinner or something, and Lucy responded like nothing had happened the night before. She didn‚Äôt even blink, completely calm and emotionless. I felt nauseous. Later, the girls told me she‚Äôd had seven lovers in the past year, and Aaron knew about two or three of them but had forgiven her to keep their family together.

A few weeks later, I went to a music festival with Maria, and we met Aaron there. He seemed sad and asked Maria for relationship advice because, no matter how much he tried, it still wasn‚Äôt working, and he suspected something was going on. Everyone at the table knew Lucy was cheating on him excessively, but no one told him. It was horrible, and I just wanted to crawl into a hole. (And yes, I know‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt tell him either. It was our first encounter, and I felt like I couldn‚Äôt.)

In the following weeks, I met Aaron several more times at different gatherings through our mutual friends and realized I had developed a crush on him. He was the nicest guy I‚Äôd ever met. He walked me home so I wouldn‚Äôt have to go alone at night, never let me carry anything heavy, and the way he interacted with the kids around was just so natural. I was mesmerized by him, but I didn‚Äôt say or do anything. I‚Äôm not someone who messes with other people‚Äôs relationships. It was strictly friendly.

Then we didn‚Äôt see each other for a few months, and meanwhile, Lucy broke up with Aaron after he caught her cheating on him with yet another man, James. Lucy took the kids and immediately moved in with James, who had a wife and two kids of his own and left them for Lucy. She claimed that James was the partner she‚Äôd always wanted and that she loved him very much.

Then it was time for Maria‚Äôs wedding. Originally, both Lucy and Aaron were invited as a couple, but only Aaron ended up attending because everyone knew what had happened, and neither the groom nor his friends wanted Lucy there. The wedding was in a different country. We spent three days celebrating, going on little trips, and just having a great time. By then, Aaron and Lucy had been broken up for three months, and Lucy was living with James.

After the wedding, Aaron and I agreed to meet up for a glass of wine, and we started seeing each other. It was amazing, and I was so happy. He was affectionate, sweet, and we could talk for hours. Even though it was a short amount of time, I could genuinely see a future with him. When I was with him, I felt a sense of inner peace that I never feel.

When Aaron and Lucy were still together, Lucy was a stay-at-home mom, and Aaron financially supported the entire family. He went on business trips at least once a week, ran his own business, and in all his free time, he took care of their sons, getting up in the night for them, handling everything. And she treated him like a doormat. From my point of view, it was horrible. A guy like that didn‚Äôt deserve any of it.

We had been seeing each other for three weeks. One weekend, I stayed at his place from Saturday to Sunday. He dropped me off at home on Sunday morning, and we had plans to meet again that evening. He took his sons to a soccer game in the afternoon. A few hours later, I got a simple message: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still with the kids, I won‚Äôt make it tonight.‚Äù I immediately knew something was wrong. My intuition just told me. When I saw that text, my stomach dropped, I threw up, and I started crying even though I didn‚Äôt fully understand why yet. He didn‚Äôt answer my call that night, and I was a wreck.

The next day, on Monday, Maria called me. She had met with Lucy for coffee and found out that Aaron had given Lucy the keys to his house, she had broken up with James, and they were planning to give their relationship another try. I hadn‚Äôt heard anything from Aaron yet; all the information I had came from Maria.

On Tuesday, I decided to go to Aaron‚Äôs house. I couldn‚Äôt just sit around while something involving me was being decided without me. I was out of town, so I drove over 200 kilometers to see him. When I got to his house around 9 PM, I saw that Lucy and the kids were inside. (You can see into the house from the street.) It was humiliating, and I left and cried till morning. The next day, I found out from Maria that Aaron wasn‚Äôt even there‚Äîhe was on a business trip.

Aaron finally called me on Wednesday afternoon, asking if we could meet. I hadn‚Äôt slept for three days at this point, and I was furious. We met that evening at his place. I knew he wanted to break things off with me, but I still couldn‚Äôt believe it was happening. Lucy slept with *seven* other guys, was ""deeply in love"" with her new lover, humiliated him in front of their neighbors and friends, treated him like garbage, and she got an abortion, which probably wasn‚Äôt even his. How could he possibly want her back?! I know I had rose-colored glasses on when it came to him, but I'm not an idiot. I could see he liked me too, and he treated me like a princess.

When I got there, I was angry because of everything he‚Äôd put me through in the last few days. But my anger quickly turned into sadness. He hadn‚Äôt returned my call because he didn‚Äôt know what to say, and he hadn‚Äôt expected me to know what was going on through Maria. I truly believe he didn‚Äôt mean to put me through all of this; it was just sheer stupidity on his part.

When I started crying, he was immediately by my side. He held me, stroked my hair, and kissed me gently everywhere but on the lips (which would have been inappropriate at that moment). Have you ever had a romantic breakup? It was so f**\***cking confusing! We didn‚Äôt look like two people who were about to break up. I stayed at his place for about three hours, and the whole time he didn‚Äôt say much. We just held each other on the couch, with me crying off and on, and him looking completely wrecked. At one point, he even had tears in his eyes.

I figured I had nothing left to lose, so I told him everything I wanted to say. Normally, you'd play it cool early in a relationship and save this stuff for later, but under the circumstances, I had to lay it all out there. I told him I'd had a crush on him from the start. That, yeah, I knew it was too soon, but I was serious about him. That I‚Äôd been looking forward to meeting his kids eventually‚Äîkids I‚Äôd already met briefly at a BBQ, and they were great. I told him I saw him as the kind of guy I'd always wanted to meet. It wasn‚Äôt awkward. He didn‚Äôt make me feel that way. It was just sincere and from the heart.

For about an hour, he just kept saying he didn‚Äôt know what to do. Until the very last moment, I didn‚Äôt believe he was actually going to break up with me, but in the end, he did. He told me he didn‚Äôt love Lucy anymore and that if they didn‚Äôt have kids, he‚Äôd never speak to her again. But since she wanted to give it another shot, he felt he had to try too, for the sake of their children. He said he probably needed to get burned again to realize it was over. He didn‚Äôt seem excited or hopeful about the idea of reuniting with her. He looked destroyed and sad. It was awful, and I know he wasn‚Äôt faking it.

This happened last week, and I still don‚Äôt get it. Info I got from our mutual friend since then:

Lucy broke up with James and spent about 14 days really trying to get back with Aaron after she found out Aaron was seeing someone else‚Äîme. Apparently, she‚Äôs been telling people she wants Aaron back because life with him is more comfortable, and he would fund her projects‚Ä¶ Meanwhile, James is heartbroken, wondering why she left him after he gave up his family for her. He‚Äôs been texting her, saying he has nothing left to live for, and she couldn‚Äôt care less. She told her friends, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not my problem,‚Äù and just hopes he doesn‚Äôt do anything drastic.

Aaron dropped me off Sunday morning, had sex with Lucy Sunday night, gave her the keys to his house on Monday, and agreed they‚Äôd get back together. By Wednesday night, he broke things off with me. Later that same night, Lucy told Aaron to go f**\***ck himself because he ‚Äútook too long to dump me‚Äù and should‚Äôve done it in a caf√© or something. By Friday morning, Aaron bought her a heart-shaped painting as a welcome-home gift and agreed to pay for her breast implants.

Can someone please explain what‚Äôs going on in this guy‚Äôs head? I just don‚Äôt get it. Thank you.

(Hope this makes sense. I used AI for the translation as I don‚Äôt live in an English-speaking country and I‚Äôm not a native English speaker. Thank you.)",1,1729758375.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

When I first began, I wasn‚Äôt properly trained. I was basically taught to learn as I go, and even now, there are things I still haven‚Äôt been taught. Despite that, I used to get around sixteen hours a week, but for the past two weeks, my hours have been reduced to just four.

I messaged the owner‚Äôs daughter, who handles the scheduling, because I wanted to request more hours. She spoke to her mother (the owner), and they told me that my hours were reduced because they need someone who can work quickly while providing good service. They said that once I improve and can work without needing to ask for help, they would give me more hours. I haven‚Äôt replied yet, but I find this frustrating because if they had trained me properly from the beginning, I wouldn‚Äôt need to ask about things I haven‚Äôt been taught.

Also, I only ask questions when I truly don‚Äôt know something. I recently found out that a coworker complained to the owner that I‚Äôm slow, which I can‚Äôt really argue with because I know I‚Äôm not the fastest. I‚Äôm fairly certain I know who said it because I‚Äôve mainly worked with just one person. It‚Äôs disappointing because we were getting close, but instead of communicating with me directly, she went to the owner.

To add to that, there was an incident in the past where she got both of us in trouble, even though it was her fault. I lied to cover for her so she wouldn‚Äôt be blamed alone, but now I‚Äôm questioning if it was worth it.
