( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

I‚Äôm a 34-year-old professor, and I love my job. I get to teach, research, and engage with bright minds every day. But here‚Äôs the thing: it‚Äôs also incredibly lonely. I am married, with kids, but seeking a special someone.

I spend my days surrounded by students and colleagues, but there‚Äôs a strange isolation that comes with being the one at the front of the room. The dynamic is always professional, always guarded. I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs supposed to have the answers, the one who‚Äôs supposed to be steady and sure. But behind the lectures and office hours, I‚Äôm just a guy who craves real, meaningful connection.

I‚Äôm looking for someone to talk to constantly, to talk about books or movies or the weirdness of life, to laugh over coffee, to be vulnerable with.

I guess what I‚Äôm really seeking is a safe space. A place (or a person) where I can take off the professor hat and just be myself‚Äîflaws, doubts, and all. Maybe you‚Äôre in a similar boat, or maybe you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs good at listening and connecting. Either way, I‚Äôd love to hear from you.

I am 6', average body, and I try to hit the gym regularly. I also like cooking, hiking, and terrible puns. I am into true crime and romcom.

I‚Äôm hoping to meet someone who is fun, engaging, and genuinely enjoys the process of getting to know another person. Whether you‚Äôre into deep conversations, spontaneous adventures, little flirting, or just sharing the little joys of everyday life, I‚Äôm all for it.  I‚Äôm looking for someone who‚Äôs willing to invest in building something meaningful over time. If you‚Äôre kind, curious, and up for the journey, let‚Äôs talk. Time zones don't matter. I am in Pacific time if you want to know.

1oiupv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1oiupv8/ive_been_told_i_dont_have_adhd/,I've been told I don't have ADHD,"I've been diagnosed with C-PTSD around 3 years ago. It wasn't an official diagnosis but my therapist acknowledged my symptoms, and said that the name isn't important at the point and we should stick with EMDR. Since then I got also diagnosed with anxiety and OCD, but they have been mostly under control.

The other day I had an online ADHD assessment as I've been suspecting it for years. The moment she learned about my health anxiety, she started being dismissive, and brushed off many symptoms I found to be textbook for ADHD: figdeting, rejection sensitivity, sensitivity to noise, emotional eating, coffee and uppers not working, daydreaming/disassociating and many others. 

She instead focused on specific questions like ""do you forget where you place your belongings"" or ""do you leave your chair during meetings"", basic ASRS questions to which I already responded before the assessment. Anyway, she basically told me that I don't have ADHD, it's just work stress/burnout, and I need better coping mechanisms, and sent me a PDF including some strategies. 

I've been feeling very down ever since, I don't know why. My latest therapist also said that I was ticking for the impulsivity part but it was because of trauma, not ADHD. And once the trauma is addressed, the symptoms should disappear. I don't believe neither of them, but not believing neither of them is also making me think whether it's my health anxiety speaking. So I don't know what to do right now, I'm at the limbo between pushing further or just letting go. Trauma work can take years. And I present the symptoms right now, so maybe getting meds would help me deal with them better. I also don't have the option to get another private assessment as they are really expensive.

It listens, writes notes, and reads things I miss ‚Äî for instance when someone says ‚Äúlet‚Äôs look at pricing again,‚Äù proactor makes it a follow-up. After the call, I no longer need to see the recordings, I just read the summary and hit send on the follow-up email that is auto-made.

By the close of day [**walnut.ai**](http://walnut.ai) reminds me about a client I had not spoken to in a while.

Two days later, sam responds and we have one more meeting. That is one more lead can be alive still, no mental work.

When I need to prepare a proposal or learn something about my clients‚Äô work I open **OpenAI atlas**. It is nice that it knows what I looked at. So if I look at logistics startups this week and fintech next, it does not merge the two. It is like an AI intern that works for me.

Let me explain,"I 30M been hanging out with 27F for about 11 months now and 3 weeks before today we really started hanging out. At first we barely talked since we worked at the same company but different stores.  She texted me asking to go bowling and had a really good time. Our second together was picking her up at her place and going to a rage room and bowling. After we went back to her place and watch a old dinsey movie. Leaving my keys, water bottle and wallet on the coffee tablet. We Cuddle a little bit while watching the movie no funny business.

 When it was time to leave she walked me to my vehicle and im the type of guy that let's chances slip away and regret it later. 

However, this time I kissed her with my left hand around her waist and my right hand on her neck. She kissed me back. I said good night. I got in my car and started driving away noticing I didn't have my water bottle or wallet. Well I reparked my vehicle went back up the stairs and there She is with my wallet and water bottle. She told me, "" did you forget something"", I sure did however i forgor three things. She asked what is the third thing. Well I kissed her again saying this is it. 

Its been a couple weeks now. No kissing, no hugging or cuddle. We do talk alot she will call me or text me everyday and ill do the same back. 

She asked me a question a week ago about food allergies.  I told her, the reason I havent took her to a restaurant is because I am unable to since I have multiple food allergies and im allergic to dogs. 

Long story short she told me she is afraid to date me due to my food allergies. I told her that is why if you dont mind me cooking and baking I would do that.  She also mentions she can eat anything she wants but I cant enjoy what she has. 

She asked me if we kissed how long do she have to wait to kiss me again. I did tell her the truth atleast 2 hrs. 

Apart of me feels like life fucked me because every relationship I try to get into falls apart when I mention the food allergies and however, im trying to stay positive because I really like this woman.

I take medication allergies pills for the dogs and wear gloves when petting her the dog will lick me a few times but wash my hands right away 

She is worried what will happen if I do have an allergic reaction. I told her I usually go to the hospital. Like I did 3 days ago due to a change it a recipe that mejiers made. 

Now, she teasing me and flirting more but still not at the spot where I thought we were at.

The legislation passed in a 52-48 vote, with five Republicans - senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and the former Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky - joining all Democrats in favor. The vote took place on day 28 of the federal government shutdown with both sides at loggerheads over spending legislation. The resolution, led by Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat of Virginia, would overturn the national emergency that Trump has declared to justify the levies, though it is all but certain to stall in the US House, where the Republican-controlled chamber acted to pre-emptively shut down any attempt to block the president's tariffs. In the unlikely event the measure were to reach the president's desk, it would meet Trump's veto. ""Tariffs are a tax on American consumers. Tariffs are a tax on American businesses. And they are a tax that is imposed by a single person: Donald J Trump,"" Kaine said in a floor speech. While Congressional Republicans have largely declined to rein in the president, Tuesday's vote revealed an underlying discontent with Trump's tariffs.
""Tariffs make both building and buying in America more expensive. The economic harms of trade wars are not the exception to history, but the rule,"" Republican Mitch McConnell said in a statement on Tuesday. ""And no cross-eyed reading of Reagan will reveal otherwise.""",48,1761709548.0,fednews,5,0.95,False

**A Pawful of Dollars** 

**---------------------------------**

**Memory Transcription Subject: Halin. Venlil Manager at Little Branson**

**Date: \[Standardized Human time\] February 29, 2138**

The hover car hummed beneath us, a low mechanical purr that didn't quite belong against the backdrop of Skalgan grassland rolling past the windows. Ray kept one hand on the steering wheel, the other drummed against his knee in time to the country song playing on the radio.

I sat in the passenger seat, my tail curled tight against my hip, watching as a herd of Rock Tumblers migrated towards Boulder Gulch and Granite Canyon beyond. The Little Branson was still a few spans ahead, but my thoughts were already there‚Äîspecifically, in the back woods where the meat vats sat humming their own tune.

""Ray,"" I said, and my voice came out smaller than I'd intended. I cleared my throat. ""We should talk about the biogel.""

He glanced over at me, brown eyes creasing at the corners‚Äîthe look he got when he was already thinking about five other problems and didn‚Äôt need a sixth. I'd seen that look before. It did nothing to settle the nerves in my chest.

""What about it?"" he asked, easy as anything.

I shifted in my seat, regretful that I had to add another worry to his already full plate. ""We're running low. Three paws' worth left, maybe four if we stretch it."" The numbers had been sitting in my head since yesterday's inventory, turning over and over like falling stones. ""I think we should order more soon. Before‚Äî""

""Before we run out?"" Ray finished, and there was amusement in his voice that made my ears flatten slightly. Not mockery, exactly. More like the gentle ribbing of someone who'd heard me bring up this particular worry before.

""Yes,"" I said, trying to sound firm about it. Professional. ""Before we run out.""

Ray nodded, but his hand kept that same steady rhythm on his knee, unbothered. Through the windshield, I could see the Little Branson starting to take shape.

""I'll put the full order in on my way to Mirror Lake City,"" Ray said. ""Meeting with the advertisers shouldn't take more than a claw or two. I'll swing by the supplier on my way back through and pick up a little more to tide us over."" He shot me a look, one eyebrow raised beneath the brim of his white cowboy hat. ""That work for you, partner?""

The way he said 'partner' made something warm and uncomfortable twist in my chest. Pride, maybe, or the fear of disappointing someone who believed in me more than I believed in myself.

""Yeah,"" I said. ""That works.""

But my tail stayed tight against my hip, and I knew he noticed.

The Little Branson came into full view as we crested the last hill‚Äîwood and brass and glass catching the late morning light,¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† looking for all the world like it had been plucked from some human history file and dropped onto Skalgan dirt, rustic and weathered. Ray had built it that way on purpose. Authentic ‚ÄúOld West‚Äù, he called it. A little piece of Earth's past in a present that still didn't quite know what to do with humans yet.

He brought the hover car down gentle, dust pluming up around us in a cloud that turned golden in the sunlight. When the engines cut, the silence felt too big.

""Halin,"" Ray said, and his voice had shifted into something more serious. Not stern, but weighted with the kind of gravity that made you pay attention. ""You're gonna be fine.""

My ears swiveled toward him automatically and I shrank in on myself.

""I know you get nervous,"" he continued. ""Hell, I'd be worried if you didn't. But you know this place inside and out. You know the menu, you know the staff, you know how to handle the customers‚Äîhuman and venlil both."" He paused, and I felt his gaze on me like a physical thing. ""You're capable, kid. More capable than you give yourself credit for.""

I wanted to believe him. I wanted to feel the confidence he seemed to see in me, to wear it like the white cowboy hat currently sitting on the seat between us. Instead, I felt like an imposter in a costume, playing at being someone I wasn't.

""What if something goes wrong?"" I asked, hating how small my voice sounded.

Ray smiled, slow and knowing. He reached over and picked up my hat, turning it over in his hands like he was examining it for the first time. ‚ÄúYou fix what needs fixing, clean what needs cleaning, and do what you need to do. If you‚Äôre feeling overwhelmed, just look at Clint Eastwood.‚Äù

Before I could ask who that was, an alarm went off on Ray‚Äôs data pad.

He hit the silence button, ‚ÄúI gotta get going Halin. You got this.‚Äù

He made it sound so simple. Like confidence was just a decision you made instead of a feeling you either had or didn't.

""I‚Äôll try not to let you down,"" I said as I exited the vehicle.

Ray Smiled, ""I know you won't. Three claws, four at most. You've got my number if anything urgent comes up, but I know it won't.""

He gave me one last look‚Äîconfident, certain, infuriatingly calm‚Äîand then the engines whined to life. I stepped back as the vehicle lifted, dust swirling around my legs and getting into my wool. Ray waved once through the window, and then he was rising into the bright Skalgan sky, the hover car shrinking until it was just a dark speck against the endless blue.

I stood there longer than I needed to, watching that speck until it disappeared entirely. The dust settled slowly around my paws, coating the black wool and making the white patches on my wrists look dingy.

You can do this, Ray had said.

But standing there in the settling dust, hat sitting heavy on my head and chest tight with anxiety, all I could think was: What if he's wrong?

I touched the brim of my hat, adjusted it slightly. The gesture felt foreign, like I was trying on someone else's life.

Behind me, The Little Branson's door stood closed. Inside, there would be work to do. Customers to serve. Staff to manage. A restaurant to run.

I took a breath‚Äîdeep and shaky‚Äîand turned toward the door.

Just a couple claws, I told myself. It‚Äôll be fine. Probably.

The restaurant felt different without Ray‚Äîlike a stage missing its lead actor. I stepped through the front doors, adjusting my white cowboy hat again, and tried to walk like I owned the place. My claws clicked against the hardwood floor, each step echoing just a little too loud in my ears. Staff moved around me, bussing tables, serving food, chattering amongst themselves. Everything looked normal. Everything felt right.

I forced my ears upright, my tail relaxed. Confidence, I reminded myself. Act like you know what to do. Project confidence and it will come.

The Little Branson sprawled out before me‚Äîall polished wood and brass fixtures, ceiling fans turning lazy circles overhead. Sunlight poured through the tall windows, cutting the room into amber and gold stripes. The bar stretched along the far wall, bottles glinting on the shelves behind it. Round tables dotted the floor, each one set with red-checkered placemats and mason jar glasses. A wooden partition with frosted glass panels divided the human and venlil sections, the policy Ray had implemented to keep everyone comfortable.

It was relatively quiet now, but it wouldn't be for long.

My gaze drifted to the bar, where Tiltva sat on a stool, fork in paw, working through a salad. Her cream-colored wool caught the light beautifully, and her pink cowboy hat‚Äîsmaller than mine, perched at a jaunty angle‚Äîmade her look effortlessly put-together. She was talking to the bartender, her ears animated, gesturing with her fork as she made some point I couldn't hear.

My tail started wagging before I could stop it.

She looked good. Really good. The hat suited her. So did the way she laughed, bright and genuine, her whole face lighting up. I could watch her all day and never get bored.

I caught myself staring and snapped my attention back to my data pad. Focus, Halin. You're the manager today. Act like it.

I pulled up the day's schedule, scanning the list of reservations and staff assignments. My paws trembled slightly, making the screen blur. I steadied them, annoyed at my own nervousness. It was just a restaurant. Just a few claws. Ray trusted me with this.

""Halin?""

I looked up. One of the servers‚Äîa young venlil with brown wool and nervous eyes‚Äîstood in front of me, ears tilted in question.

""Yeah?"" I said, trying to sound casual.

""We're running low on the hickory glaze. Should I open a new container, or do you want to stretch what we have?""

I blinked. Hickory glaze. Right. We used that for the ribs. How much did we have left? What was the usual protocol? Ray would know immediately, wouldn't even have to think about it.

""Uh, open a new one,"" I said, hoping I sounded decisive. ""Better to have too much than run out during the rush.""

The server nodded and hurried off. I exhaled slowly, second-guessing myself instantly. What if we didn't need the new container? What if I was wasting supplies? What if‚Äî

‚ÄúHalin, table seven says the pitch on the country mix is too sharp for venlil ears. You want me to swap it to the Love-Sick Playlist?‚Äù

Another server had walked up to me without my notice while I was lost in my thoughts.

""Sure,"" I said, then reconsidered. ""Actually, no. Switch it to the Nostalgia Playlist. That one‚Äôs easier on everyone.""

Was it? I had no idea. But the staff member nodded and moved on, and I was left standing there, clutching my data pad like a lifeline.

The music shifted‚Äîa soft country tune with a gentle twang that filled the spaces between conversations. Business was picking up. A couple of venlil entered through the front doors, followed by a human in a denim jacket. I watched them get seated, watched the servers move efficiently between tables, watched the restaurant come to life around me.

It was all running smoothly. Despite my nerves, despite my constant second-guessing, the Little Branson functioned like a well-oiled machine.

Maybe Ray was right. Maybe I could handle this.

I moved through the dining room, checking tables, pausing to greet customers, adjusting a crooked placemat here and there. The work was becoming familiar, soothing in its routine. I could do this. One task at a time.

I was passing the human side of the bar when I caught a snippet of conversation from two human men seated nearby, both nursing beers and looking disgruntled.

""‚Äîbiggest disappointment of the decade,"" one of them said, shaking his head. ""I mean, I had high hopes for the remake, but that CGI face they slapped on the actor? It completely ruined it.""

""Right?"" the other agreed. ""Clint Eastwood's rolling in his grave. That squint, that presence‚Äîyou can't just fake that with AI. The whole thing felt... wrong.""

""Should've left the original alone. A Fistful of Dollars didn't need a 2127 update.""

I slowed, curious despite myself. A Fistful of Dollars? I'd never heard of it. And that name rang a bell.

The men continued their griping, but I couldn't help myself. I approached their table, clearing my throat politely.

""Excuse me,"" I said, ears tilted in apology. ""I couldn't help but overhear. Who's Clint Eastwood?""

Both men looked up at me, surprised. Then one of them grinned and pointed toward the bar.

""That guy,"" he said.

I followed his gesture. Behind the bar, mounted on the wall between an antique firearm and a wooden wheel, was a poster I'd passed a hundred times without really seeing.

A human man stood front and center, face shadowed by a wide-brimmed hat, a poncho draped over his shoulders. A revolver rested on his hip, a rifle slung over his shoulder. His expression was hard, unyielding‚Äîa scowl that somehow conveyed both danger and calm.

Beneath the image, bold letters read: ""That's how it is in the West: You do what you have to do.""

I stared at the poster and something tightened in my chest.

""That's Clint Eastwood,"" the man continued. ""Old Earth actor. Westerns, mostly. Played a lot of tough, silent types. The kind of guy who didn't talk much but always got the job done.""

""He was a legend,"" the other man added. ""Back in the day, anyway. Died about a hundred years ago, but people still remember him. That squint, that presence‚Äîit's iconic.""

I stepped closer to the bar, my eyes fixed on the poster. Eastwood's gaze seemed to bore into me, unwavering and intense. The revolver, the rifle, the poncho‚Äîit all spoke of competence, of someone who knew exactly what they were doing and didn't need anyone's approval to do it.

‚ÄòThat's how it is in the West: You do what you have to do.‚Äô

The words echoed in my mind, colliding with Ray's advice from earlier. Look at Clint and do what he says.

I reached up and touched the brim of my white cowboy hat, feeling the fabric beneath my paw. It felt foreign, like a costume. Like something I was borrowing from someone else's life.

I wasn't Clint Eastwood. I wasn't even Ray.

I glanced back at the two men, nodding my thanks, and moved away from the bar. The poster stayed with me, though, burned into my thoughts. That silent strength. That unshakable confidence. I wanted that so badly it hurt.

Instead, I had a trembling data pad and a habit of second-guessing every decision.

I laughed‚Äîa short, nervous sound that barely escaped my throat‚Äîand looked back at the poster one more time. Eastwood's squint followed me across the room, watchful and unimpressed.

""Yeah,"" I muttered under my breath. ""Easy for you to say.""

Sunlight cut through the tall windows in thick golden bands, dust motes swimming lazy in the air. From the kitchen, the smell of frying onions and hickory glaze drifted out in waves, mixing with the faint scent of coffee and warm corn bread. I stood at the host stand, restocking menus in their wooden holder, and tried not to think about all the things that could go wrong.

It was just a couple of claws, I reminded myself. What could go wrong?

Everything, my brain supplied helpfully. The biogel could run out. A pipe could burst. A customer could have an allergic reaction. Equinek could show up and find something, anything, to shut us down.

I shook my head, forcing the thoughts away. Not helpful. Focus on what you can control.

I straightened the menus, aligned them perfectly in their holder, then checked my data pad for the third time in as many minutes. Reservations were steady. Staff was in position. Everything was running smoothly.

The weight of being left in charge sat heavy in my chest anyway, like a stone I couldn't quite swallow.

The door chimed.

Light shifted, spilling across the floor as the front door swung open. I looked up instinctively, ears perking. Thyla was already at the podium, her posture snapping to attention, professional and controlled. She always did that‚Äîarmor herself behind perfect manners whenever customers arrived, especially venlil ones.

Four figures stepped inside.

The human woman came first. Tan skin, calm and confident in the way she moved, her hazel eyes taking in the restaurant with undisguised interest. Her hair was pulled back in a long braid that hung down to her waist‚Äîjust like the style that had been everywhere in the capital lately. She wore simple clothes, comfortable and practical, and carried herself with an easy warmth that made me think of my mother.

Behind her came a venlil woman, a head shorter with fluffy light grey wool trimmed neat and precise. The wool on her head and around her neck was braided like the human's hair, very popular in the capital I'd heard. Her blue eyes were soft, curious, looking between Thyla and the dining room beyond.

Two venlil pups trailed behind them. A small girl clung to her mother's tail with one paw, her other paw swinging free. A boy held onto the girl's tail, forming a little chain. Both of them stared at Thyla with wide, unblinking blue eyes, their ears perked forward in intense focus.

Thyla registered the family with polite distance, her tail still, her expression neutral. Professional.

""Good paw,"" the human woman said, her voice friendly and warm. ""Table for four, please?""

Thyla's ears dipped slightly‚Äîan apologetic gesture.

""Of course,"" Thyla said, her tone measured. ""I do need to let you know that first-time guests are required to dine in the non-human section, per restaurant policy.""

She gestured toward the wooden partition with its frosted glass panels, dividing the dining rooms. The venlil section was just as nice as the human one‚Äîsame tables, same decor, same service‚Äîbut the separation was there, deliberate and visible.

The venlil woman's ears lowered, disappointment flickering across her face. Not anger‚Äîjust sadness, the kind that came from being used to this sort of thing.

The human woman's expression tightened, confusion and discomfort warring with politeness. ""I... see,"" she said slowly. ""Is there a reason for that?""

""It's to prevent incidents,"" Thyla explained, her voice still apologetic but firm. ""Some customers are more comfortable dining separately until they're familiar with the restaurant. Once you've visited a few times, you're welcome to request seating in either section.""

The venlil woman placed a paw on the human's back, a gentle touch that said \*I'm sorry\*. The human hesitated, then nodded, the disappointment clear in the set of her mouth.

""If that's the policy,"" she said quietly, ""then that's the policy.""

I watched from my spot near the host stand, my ears tilting back. I hated this part‚Äîthe partition, the policy, the way it made good people feel unwelcome. But Ray insisted it was necessary, at least for now. Had to make sure the non-human patrons could handle humans eating meat before they went to the human side.

Still, it left a bad taste in my mouth.

The twins, meanwhile, hadn't stopped staring at Thyla. Their eyes were locked on her, unblinking, their ears so far forward they looked like they might tip over. It was the kind of intense, unfiltered attention only pups could manage, and it was clearly unnerving Thyla. Her tail twitched at the tip, the only crack in her professional facade.

She cleared her throat. ""Right this way, please.""

But before she could move, the little girl blurted out, ""Pretty.""

She pointed at Thyla with her tail, the appendage curling toward the hostess with unmistakable intent.

The boy tugged on the human woman's hand, his own tail pointing at Thyla as well. ""Mama! Pretty!""

The human woman's expression softened instantly, a small, amused smile tugging at her lips. She looked down at the boy, then at Thyla, and said with warm tenderness, ""Yes, she is.""

I saw it happen‚Äîthe exact moment the compliment landed.

Thyla's cheeks flushed blue, a vivid bloom of color spreading across her face. Her ears shot up, betraying her surprise, and her tail‚Äîstill as stone a moment ago‚Äîbegan to wag. She tried to stop it, I could tell, but the motion was involuntary, a reflex of pure happiness she couldn't suppress.

""Th-thank you,"" Thyla stammered, her voice softer now, less guarded. She cleared her throat again, trying to regain her composure, but the flush remained, and so did the wag. ""Right this way, please.""

She led the family through the dining room toward their table, her steps a little less rigid, a little more genuine. The twins continued to watch her, their eyes wide with innocent admiration, and Thyla‚Äîdespite her best efforts‚Äîcouldn't stop the small, pleased bounce in her ears.

I stayed near the podium, watching from a polite distance as Thyla guided the family to their table in the venlil section. Her movements were different now‚Äîless mechanical, more present. The flush in her cheeks hadn't faded, and her tail still carried that telltale wag, the one she couldn't quite suppress.

She set the menus down carefully, distributing them around the table with practiced ease. But when she straightened and looked at the family‚Äîreally looked at them‚Äîsomething in her expression shifted. The professional mask slipped further, revealing something softer underneath.

""Enjoy your meal,"" she said, and her voice was different too. Warm. Genuine.

The venlil woman bowed her head, ears tilting in gratitude. The human woman nodded, that same gentle warmth in her eyes, and thanked her. And the twins‚Äîstill watching Thyla with that unblinking intensity‚Äîboth wagged their tails in perfect synchronization.

""Bye,"" the kids said together.

Thyla's ears rose even higher, and for a moment, she just stood there, basking in it. In being seen. In being called pretty by two innocent pups who didn't have a single ounce of cruelty or judgment in them.

I felt something tighten in my chest‚Äînot jealousy, exactly, but a kind of vicarious happiness. Thyla didn't let people in easily. She kept herself guarded, professional, distant. But those twins had cracked through her defenses in seconds, and the result was evident.

When she turned and walked back toward the podium, her steps were lighter. The rigid professionalism had melted away, leaving someone younger, brighter, more herself.

I leaned against the wall, watching her approach, and couldn't resist the playful tone in my voice.

""Your tail's wagging,"" I said, letting the mischief show in my tilted ears.

Thyla stopped, her eyes widening slightly before narrowing in mock indignation. She folded her arms across her chest, the picture of defensive dignity. ""They were polite,"" she said firmly. ""Especially the little ones.""

""I noticed."" I kept my tone light. ""Well, keep at it. Place could use a few more wagging tails.""

Her blush deepened, spreading from her cheeks to the tips of her ears. She turned back to the podium quickly, as if putting distance between us would somehow erase the compliment. But her tail kept wagging, and I could see the pleased set of her ears, the way she couldn't quite hide her happiness.

Good, I thought. She deserves that.

I pushed off from the counter, intending to head toward the bar to check on supplies‚Äîmaybe chat with Tiltva for a moment, see how her lunch was going‚Äîbut my hind paw had other plans.

It caught on the edge of the step I'd somehow forgotten was there.

I pitched forward, paws flailing in a desperate attempt to find purchase. I caught the edge of the partition at the last possible second, halting my fall with all the grace of a newborn flower bird learning to fly.

For a moment, everything was still.

I straightened quickly, retrieving my hat and jamming it back onto my head. My ears flattened against my skull as I pretended‚Äîdesperately‚Äîthat nothing had happened.

Then I heard it.

A giggle.

Bright, unrestrained, and unmistakably Tiltva.

I looked toward the bar and saw her, one paw covering her muzzle, her shoulders shaking with laughter. Her blue eyes sparkled with mirth, and even as I met her gaze, she couldn't stop the giggles from spilling out.

The bartender chuckled too, low and amused, shaking his head as he poured another drink.

And then‚Äîthe final betrayal‚ÄîThyla let out a small, genuine giggle of her own. Her paw flew up to cover her muzzle, but it did nothing to muffle the sound.

I felt my face heat beneath my wool, my tail tucking slightly in embarrassment.

""All part of the plan,"" I said stiffly, adjusting my hat with as much dignity as I could scrape together.

Thyla's giggles only grew louder, her whole body shaking now.

I sighed, my tail giving a faint, resigned wag, and forced myself to walk toward the bar with my head held high.

At least they were laughing. At least the mood was light.

And at least‚Äîthank the stars‚ÄîRay wasn't here to see it.

I was still recovering from my stumble, adjusting my hat for what felt like the hundredth time that paw, when the front doors slammed open. The sound cracked through the restaurant like a gunshot‚Äîwood on wood, loud enough to make my ears flatten instinctively. The music died mid-note. Conversations stopped as if someone had cut the power to everyone's voices at once. Even the ceiling fans seemed to slow, their lazy circles suddenly hesitant.

I turned toward the entrance, my tail going rigid.

A venlil stood in the doorway, backlit by the afternoon sun streaming through behind him. White wool, pristine and carefully maintained. A black inspector's cap sat low over his eyes, the brim casting his face in shadow. He didn't move right away‚Äîjust stood there, letting the silence stretch, letting everyone in the restaurant turn to look at him.

Then he stepped inside, and the doors swung shut behind him with a softer thud that somehow felt worse than the initial bang.

He moved like he owned the place. Each step deliberate, measured, his gaze sweeping the room with cold precision. His eyes‚Äîpale grey, almost colorless‚Äîtouched on every table, every server, every customer. He wasn't looking at the restaurant. He was cataloging it. Hunting through it.

My breath caught in my chest.

A small data pad was clipped to his belt, positioned where a human might wear a holster. The comparison wasn't lost on me. It sat there like a weapon, ready to be drawn and fired. His tail hung perfectly still behind him, not a single twitch of emotion breaking its rigid line.

Everything about him screamed authority. Danger.

I felt my legs lock in place, my paws frozen to the floor. Around me, the staff had gone silent too, their ears back, their bodies tense. Even the customers seemed to sense it‚Äîthe shift in atmosphere, the weight of something wrong settling over the room like dust.

The white venlil's gaze continued its sweep, moving from table to table, lingering on the partition between the human and venlil sections, then sliding toward the bar. Toward the kitchen entrance. Toward all the places where secrets might hide.

My heart hammered against my ribs. I wanted to move, to do something, but my body refused to cooperate.

Then his eyes landed on the podium where Thyla stood.

He walked toward her with that same measured pace, his claws clicking against the hardwood floor. The sound was too loud in the silence, each step an announcement of his presence, his power.

He didn't wait to be greeted. Didn't pause for pleasantries.

He reached the podium and pulled a credentials card from his belt pocket, slamming it down on the wooden surface with enough force to make Thyla flinch. The sharp crack of plastic on wood echoed through the room.

""My name is Rehlek,"" he said, his voice flat and cold. ""With the Mirror Lake Health and Safety Office.""

The words hung in the air, heavy and final.

I felt my stomach drop.

Health and Safety. An inspection. Unannounced. Unexpected.

This was bad. This was very, very bad.

Rehlek's pale eyes fixed on Thyla, and his next words came out slow and deliberate, each syllable landing like a hammer blow.

""We've had reports that this establishment is serving flesh.""

The world tilted.

Flesh. He said flesh. He knew.

My mind went blank, white noise rushing through my ears. Around me, I heard sharp intakes of breath from the venlil customers. One of the twins at the family's table let out a curious bleat. The human customers looked confused, uncertain, their eyes darting between the inspector and the staff.

Thyla stood frozen behind the podium, her ears pressed flat against her skull, her tail tucked tight. Her eyes were wide, terrified, the confidence from moments ago completely shattered.

Rehlek didn't move. He just stared her down, his expression unreadable beneath the shadow of his cap.

""Where is your manager?"" he asked.

Thyla's mouth opened, but no sound came out. Her gaze darted sideways‚Äîtoward me. A desperate, pleading look that said \*help me\*.

I tried to step forward. Tried to speak.

My throat closed up.

All the anxiety, all the imposter syndrome, all the fear I'd been carrying since Ray left‚Äîit crashed down on me like a rockslide. I wasn't qualified for this. I wasn't ready. I couldn't handle an inspection, couldn't face down an authority figure like Rehlek, couldn't‚Äî

""I‚Äî"" I started, and my voice cracked.

Rehlek's head turned. Slowly. Deliberately.

His pale grey eyes locked onto mine.

I felt pinned in place, like prey caught in the open by a predator. His gaze was cold, clinical, dissecting me with the same precision he'd used to scan the restaurant. He took in my white cowboy hat, my black wool, the way my paws trembled at my sides.

My ears flattened completely. My tail tucked tighter. I tried to stand straighter, tried to summon some shred of the confidence Ray always seemed to have, but it wouldn't come. I felt small. Exposed. Inadequate.

""I'm‚Äî"" I tried again, forcing the words past the knot in my throat. ""I'm the manager on duty.""

The words came out barely above a whisper.

Rehlek didn't blink. His expression didn't change. He just stared at me, silent and unmoving, letting the weight of his authority press down on me like a physical thing.

Then he spoke.

""You will show me everything.""

It wasn't a request. It wasn't even a command. It was a statement of fact, cold and inevitable.

My mind raced. Everything. He wanted to see everything. The kitchen. The storage. The human dining room where we served the real meat. If he found that‚Äîif he saw what we were really doing‚Äî

My paws clenched into fists at my sides, claws digging into my paw pads.

I couldn't let him discover the real meat we were serving to the omnivores who wanted it. Ray had built this whole operation on secrecy, on careful discretion, and now it was all about to come crashing down because I‚Äî

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

# üéØ **Word of the Day: Gratitude**


Gratitude isn‚Äôt just saying ‚Äúthank you‚Äù, it‚Äôs a lens that sharpens everything you see. It‚Äôs what turns an ordinary cup of coffee, a deep breath, or a tough lesson into something meaningful. Gratitude shows up when you stop chasing what‚Äôs missing and start noticing what‚Äôs already holding you together. It‚Äôs not weakness, it‚Äôs power, because it rewires your focus from scarcity to strength. When you live with gratitude, even struggle starts to feel like growth.  


Today, don‚Äôt let moments slip by unacknowledged. Name them, savor them, let them remind you of how much is still good and unfolding around you. Ground yourself in gratitude, it‚Äôs your ally against the noise.

1oiucgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarketingSecrets101/comments/1oiucgr/the_digital_nomad_dream_instagram_vs_the/,The Digital Nomad Dream: Instagram vs. The Unfiltered Reality,"We've all scrolled past those stunning Instagram posts: laptops on pristine beaches, coffee with incredible cityscapes, a seemingly effortless life of travel and work. It looks like a dream, doesn't it?

Sitting here with my chai, observing the growing fascination with the digital nomad (an individual who uses telecommunications to earn a living while traveling) lifestyle, I often wonder if we truly understand what lies beyond those picture-perfect moments. While the number of U.S. digital nomads surged by 131% between 2019 and 2022 to reach 16.9 million individuals, according to MBO Partners, the reality is often less glamorous.

The idea of working from anywhere, fueled by remote tech and even made 'official' by digital nomad visas (permits to live and work remotely in a foreign country) introduced by many countries since 2023, seems liberating. However, many face tough realities. Lauren Razavi, author of 'Global Natives,' highlighted in 2021 that ""The allure of working from a beach often overshadows the reality of inconsistent Wi-Fi, timezone challenges, and the constant hustle required to maintain clients and income."" Adding to this, recent events like rising global inflation (2023-2024) have increased living costs even in once-affordable hotspots, putting financial pressure on many. In fact, MBO Partners' 2023 report noted that around 54% of digital nomads earn less than $75,000 annually, with unpredictable income streams, and roughly 60% cite 'financial stability concerns' as a major drawback, as per Nomad List's 2023 surveys.

Then there's the loneliness; approximately 40-50% of digital nomads report experiencing social isolation, significantly higher than traditional office workers, according to psychological studies from 2021-2023. As Dr. Nancy K. Napier, a Professor of International Business, pointed out in 2022, ""While the freedom is intoxicating, the constant search for community and stability can be exhausting."" The stress of constant travel has even led to a growing conversation about 'digital nomad burnout' online in 2023. Logistical challenges are immense too. Over 50% struggle with tax compliance due to differing international regulations, according to Deloitte's 2023 insights, and a tax consultant aptly described these administrative hurdles as a ""complex administrative puzzle that social media never shows you."" Even here in India, where cities like Goa are becoming hubs for remote workers (Times of India, 2023), infrastructure issues like inconsistent Wi-Fi and power cuts can severely impact productivity, as noted by Startup India in 2022.

So, is the 'glamour' just a lie? Not really. Sach yeh hai, the 'glamour' isn't a lie, but a deeply personal choice with inherent trade-offs. For many, the adventure, personal growth, and break from societal norms make these challenges worth it. It‚Äôs not about being 'easy'; it's about finding what truly resonates with your spirit. Cal Newport, author of 'Deep Work,' reminds us that ""Constant novelty can prevent the deep reflection and routine needed for true self-improvement."" This suggests true growth often requires more than just changing locations.

If you are considering this path, do your research beyond the highlight reels. Understand the full spectrum of financial, mental, and logistical hurdles. Prepare for the 'unspoken realities' with thorough planning, emergency funds, and a strategy for building genuine connections.

What are your thoughts, dosto? If you're a digital nomad, what's one 'unspoken reality' you wish you knew before starting? If you're considering it, what worries you the most?

I‚Äôve been thinking about building a **donation platform for NGOs and temples in Nepal**, kind of like *Buy Me a Coffee* but focused on the Nepali market.

Here‚Äôs the idea:

* NGOs, temples, or social organizations could **create a donation page** (or embed a donation widget on their existing site).
* Donors could send money via **local gateways (eSewa, Khalti)** or **international options (Stripe/PayPal)**.
* The platform would handle **tracking, transparency, and donor receipts**, so both sides can see how much was raised.

My main questions:

1. Do you think NGOs, temples, or small charities in Nepal would **actually use and pay** for something like this?
2. Many already use direct eSewa QR ‚Äî so what would make them switch to a managed platform?

I‚Äôm not trying to launch anything yet ‚Äî just researching if this could be a **viable local business** before I start building

Frozen by the neglect of her needs.

She is the wisdom of generations,
She is the breath of wild nature,

I called you ‚Äú—á—É–¥–æ‚Äù
When we first met,
You are ‚Äú—á—É–¥–æ.‚Äù
Because I have never met anyone so wonderful,
Not before, not after.

You were pure innocence in its earliest form,
You were faith in a bright future,
You were trembling trust
That no one would ever hurt you.

And I hurt you.
Offended you, betrayed you,
Decided for both of us,
Ignored your needs,
Violated you, used you,
Wiped my feet on you.

You prayed and cried that day,
When frightened, you hid under the table from me.
And I was silent,
Saying I‚Äôd never hurt you again, that there would be no more pain,
And then still did what I wanted to do.

Did you want to be with me? Sadly, yes.
Because you always chose those who loved you,
And never the ones you loved.
Did you want such a fate? Surely not.
Would you wish such a man for your daughter?
I think you‚Äôd hide her from him in a castle guarded by a dragon.

I‚Äôm sorry I turned out not to be a prince,
But an ogre, or maybe even a donkey.
God, what a donkey I am.

A donkey in feelings,
A goat in actions,
A pig in relationships,
A rat in meeting your needs.
You wouldn‚Äôt even need a zoo with me,
I am nature itself in its worst state.

I am the one who would grab you by the hair
And carry you into a cave to do whatever he wants.
I am a killer of souls, a poacher, a punisher,
A waiter who‚Äôd spill coffee on you
If you didn‚Äôt tip him.

How much more you deserve,
And why did you choose me?
You didn‚Äôt choose anyone.
You just picked the one
Who said he chose you.

Why do the best people end up with the biggest scoundrels?
And why can I no longer rejoice in that?

A couple of months in, things feel really easy. No judgment, no awkwardness, just kindness and grounded energy. He listens in a way that‚Äôs rare, and our dynamic doesn‚Äôt feel strained. Some friends are thrown off most of them date within 2-3 years of their age. One even joked it‚Äôs like dating someone‚Äôs dad, which stung more than expected.

1oitxh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1oitxh8/a_thousand_mile_fsd_trip/,A thousand mile FSD trip,"I just completed a 1,062 mile drive from Washington DC area to Naples Florida in about 16 hours of actual driving. 
I had four stop stops for charging my 2023 Model S, each about 15 to 20 minutes. (Barely time to go to the restroom and buy a coffee.). Some of this trip (Richmond VA to Brunswick GA) was in pouring cold rain and utter darkness, however the finish was  in bright sunshine and 75¬∞ temperatures. 
FSD 14 appeared the day before my departure,  so of course I installed it. FSD drove the entire trip except a couple of brief times. And FSD just gets better and better, now with four levels - I mainly used Standard and Hurry.  
Hurry is a little too fast for me, wanting to drive 85 mph in a 70 mph area ‚Äî I don‚Äôt like to be the lone car going 15 mph over the posted limit; if there are others doing the same thing, maybe there‚Äôs safety in numbers.  So, if I‚Äôm pretty much alone, I use Standard which will do 75 or 77 in a 70 mph limit zone.
When arriving at a Supercharger, FSD picks out a stall and parks itself. When you‚Äôre done, it pulls out and goes right back on the highway. 
Even in heavy rain and darkness, when I can‚Äôt see the road markings, FSD has no trouble finding the lane and staying centered. (It does sometimes reduce speed a little, but that‚Äôs sensible.)
To sum it up, FSD 14 makes driving about as stressful as flying in a commercial airplane - you are simply a passenger, and you must look at the road ahead. In a plane you could watch a movie, but in a Tesla it  is listen to either radio, podcasts, or an audible book.  The nag feature is still there and will irritate you sooner and more often than necessary. 
This is, I think, absolutely the best road trip car on the highway, or equally in an unfamiliar, complicated city. Kudos to Tesla ‚Äî my car has AI. 
Oh yeah, I forgot to mention Grok which found me a suitable hotel on a dark, cold, rainy night in North Carolina.

My name is Ethan, and my life at the East Campus dorms was supposed to be quiet. I pictured late nights with textbooks, maybe a few friendly faces, and the smell of old coffee. Instead, I got **Blake** and **Tyler**, the two most chaotic, loudest, and‚ÄîI grudgingly admit‚Äîbest-looking roommates on the whole floor, constantly vying for... something.

It was a Tuesday afternoon. I was bundled up in my over-sized brown sweatshirt and perpetually wrinkled pants, trying to focus on my History notes. My glasses kept slipping down my freckled nose, and I was grateful for the soft ocean blue of my eyes being covered by the huge frames. The only real peace I ever found was when I was petting **Cookie**, my handsome Golden Retriever/Dalmatian mix, who was currently sprawled at my feet, his brown eyes tracking the movement between the two titans across the hall.

Blake, the first titan, leaned against the door-frame, radiating an absurd amount of heat even while covered up. His 6‚Äô3‚Äù frame was straining the seams of his plain white long-sleeve, and the black silky pants looked criminally expensive for a college dorm. The grey face-mask and the silver bracelets on his wrist did nothing to hide the sheer bulk of his biceps and abs‚Äîyou could tell he was super jacked out. Even his amazing mixed silver, grey, black, and brownish hair with those stark white highlights was mostly hidden beneath a grey hoodie.

‚ÄúHe needs to be approached correctly, Tyler,‚Äù Blake‚Äôs voice was a low, smooth growl, his silver eyes narrowed behind the mask. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt rush **Ethan** like you rush a yeast infection.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeast infection?‚Äù Tyler scoffed. Tyler, also 6‚Äô3‚Äù, looked effortlessly perfect in his white sweater that fit him just right and his slightly grayish blue jeans held up by a black belt. His brown messy hair flopped slightly as he gestured with his wrist, the nice watch flashing under the fluorescent light. His green eyes held a fierce spark that did strange things to his very nice jawline. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Baking Major, Robinson. I know precision. You‚Äôre a Music Major, your only precision is tuning that fancy guitar you won‚Äôt let anyone see.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy guitar is worth more than your entire bakery, Jacobson,‚Äù Blake retorted, taking a step toward him. The movement was fluid, controlled, and made the dragon tattoo that stretched from his left shoulder to his waist ripple under the fabric.

I sighed and ran a hand through my sandy blond hair. ‚ÄúGuys, please. Cookie is trying to sleep.‚Äù

At the sound of his name, Cookie let out a small, hungry whimper. He looked longingly at the plastic container Tyler was holding. Tyler, predictably, used this as leverage.

‚ÄúSee, Ethan? My cookies bring joy and peace,‚Äù Tyler said, placing a perfect, chocolate chip cookie on the rug in front of Cookie.

‚ÄúMy family bought the company that makes those cookies, Jacobson. I could end your supply chain in a second,‚Äù Blake hissed, kicking a discarded aluminum can away from the path to my door.

Violet‚Äîmy actual friend and the only normal person on the floor‚Äîmaterialized behind Blake. She was dressed in her typical over-sized white sweatshirt and dark pants, her dark blue, night-sky eyes narrowed in immediate judgment. Her long, dyed dark blue hair with a hint of purple was pinned up messily.

‚ÄúBlake, honey, the college newspaper knows you‚Äôre both trillionaires. It‚Äôs not a secret anymore,‚Äù Violet deadpanned, effortlessly defusing the tension. ‚ÄúAlso, Tyler, those cookies are store-bought. I watched you buy them from the vending machine.‚Äù

Tyler gasped in mock offense, clutching his chest. ‚ÄúBetrayal!‚Äù

I watched the exchange, utterly bewildered, as I always was. They acted like children, but they carried themselves with the effortless power of men who knew their way around a boardroom. I just thought they were rich, slightly unhinged roommates who hated each other.

*Why* they hated each other remained a mystery. Sometimes, when they fought over something trivial, I'd catch a brief, raw flicker of genuine pain in their eyes, quickly masked by bravado. A fleeting shadow of heartbreak. It was weird.

What I didn't know was that flicker was over a shared memory of a middle school boy who‚Äôd moved away, a boy who‚Äôd forgotten the accident that had wiped the slate clean, and a boy who was now back, totally oblivious, viewing them only as the two noisy dorm guys constantly at war. The war to win my heart‚Äîa heart that couldn't even remember the rules of the game.

I picked up the cookie Tyler had put down. ‚ÄúThanks, Tyler. And Blake, your shirt is on inside out again.‚Äù

Blake froze, glanced down, and quickly adjusted the collar, a flustered sound escaping his mask. Tyler snickered, a small, victorious smirk playing on his nice jawline. The war raged on.",1,1761707682.0,writers,2,1.0,False
1oitvy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/barexam/comments/1oitvy7/passed_j25_ny_with_a_297_and_my_chaotic_barprep/,"Passed J25 NY with a 297 and my chaotic bar-prep experience: tips, advice, and mistakes.","Hey guys, 

I passed the July 2025 bar exam in NY with a 297. My MBE was 142.6 (averagish) and my writing score was 154.4. I went to a T-4 law school and I graduated with a 3.00 GPA. So trust me: if I can do it, you can too! 

**TLDR**: I recommend using Critical Pass flashcards as slides while going through the lectures and then breaking them down into smaller flashcards with quizlet or anki. I believe that had I done it from the very beginning my bar-prep journey wouldn't have been so chaotic. You're not alone. I wish you guys the best of luck. Also, there is a list of reddit resources at the bottom I used outside of barbri. 

I'm sharing this in a semi-chaotic way because it highlights my indecisiveness while prepping for the bar exam. I could clean it up for bullets. But this exam drove me nuts. So read it to feel what I felt or stick with the TLDR. 

# Mental State During the Exam: 

I was sleep deprived. I did not sleep for more than 5 hours the week leading up to the exam or the nights before. I was also going through zyn withdrawals during the exam lol. At some points I couldn't understand what I was reading. LLCs and Con law were brutal. I kept moving. 

The same thing happened during the MPTs and MBEs. There was a point with the MBE's I just didn't know what I was reading. I walked in thinking I was going to fail and I walked out believing I failed. I came to terms with having to sit for the bar exam again. But, somehow I managed to pass.  

Kick that Zyn habit before its too late! 

# Tips/advice/mistakes:  

# Critical pass is underrated. 

They are pretty much slides to all the barbri lectures. DONT SLEEP ON CRITICAL PASS (like I did). Also I took notes during the barbri lectures. I panicked the last 2-3 weeks before the bar because I felt like I knew nothing. I bought the critical pass cards and went through them and took notes. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS(A LOT OF WORK 2-3 weeks out from the exam). 

Nearly every answer to the MBE questions can be found in the critical pass cards. I know this because I had already done roughly 900 MBE practice questions at that point. I would associate a rule found within a card that I had previously got incorrect on a practice question. 

Further, had I started again, I would have broken down the Critical Pass cards into smaller flash cards with a program like ANKI or Quizlet WAYYY EARLIER (DAY 1). I scrambled to do this in the last two weeks. Also, I tried to use Chat GPT and claud, but they would mess it up too much. I spent more time than I'd care to admit trying to do this lol. I recommend breaking them down yourself. 

However, what I did from the very beginning of bar prep, was what I did in law school, and that was active recall with a whiteboard. I would write out rules by topic.  Over and over again. This is very time consuming and **I don't** recommend it. I'm a slow writer. Get yourself critical pass as a supplement, and break them down into flash cards. Active recall is the key to success on the bar exam. 

Opt. for critical pass over using a whiteboard, if you can, and make your own flashcards.

I have 10 whiteboards underneath my bed, still...

# Studicata 

Since I used Studicata throughout law school, I did get their Attack Outline. It was helpful for synthesizing the rules. I think, however, critical pass is superior. 

I recommend using both studicata and critical pass. 

I spent too much time rewriting those studicata rules out on a whiteboard.

# Active Recall!  

Active Recall is necessary. Whether you're using flashcards or a white board(at your own risk lol), you must go through each topic. For the most part, as I said previously, I used a white board and would not recommend this. I would have chosen those Critical Pass cards, had I had to take the exam again, and make my own. 

When I was using a whiteboard I would start a topic, say civ pro, I'd be on joinder one night, then the next morning I would start Crim Pro. This was a repetitive, self-inflicted anxiety trip, ""I know nothing about this topic, let me get back to Joinder later,"" or whatever topic i left off on. But, I would not get back to it until next week. It was a HUGE MISTAKE. *I watch(ed) it happen over and over again* (Oliver Tree, anyone?). 

However, the week before the exam, I tried doing the active recall by typing it out, but I would just get so overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information, and as with the whiteboard, my mistake was typing it out. I will, nevertheless, note that some people swear by typing out the rules.   

Flashcards are underrated. The whiteboard killed me :(. 

# Barbri Lectures: 

I liked most of the barbri videos. I skipped secured transactions and family law, however. I took them in law school and I felt that critical pass was just fine for those topics. 

Would recommend the videos. 

I did not like the readings(CC) nor the outlines.  They either said too much or too little. I reread the CC, more than I would care to admit, and type notes. This was just too overwhelming, for me. 

A break from the whiteboard!

# Adaptibar vs. Barbri MBE Practice: 

I could not for the life of me score better than 50% on a barbri practice MBE set. There were instances where I would achieve a 78%. But my average with barbri before the exam was approximately 54%. So, i had decided to stick with Adaptibar, in early July. I averaged between 68-70% by the time I took the exam. Adaptibar is superior to barbri's MBE. Their explanations are also great as well. Whenever I got one wrong, I would ask a friend or really try to understand the explanations. I should have kept a word doc, honestly, but I didn't. I wish I had made that doc. 

Barbri MBE practice sets suck compared to Adaptibar. I used UWorld in law school, it was so helpful. 

Barbri MBE practice sets crushed my soul worse than the white board :(

# Barbri's Practice MEE: 

I was not a fan of Barbri's practice essays. I felt the issues were often too broad or too narrow, and it depended on the subject or topic. Two weeks before the exam, I looked up old bar MEE topics, and realized it's not as terrible as Barbri is making it out to be. I felt as if the ""real"" essays were narrow. I gave up on practice essays, I planned to do what I did in law school, IRAC. I don't really regret this. But it might not work for everyone. I believe I was scoring in the passing or near passing range on barbri's practice MEEs. 

Did terrible on these. Practice them if you're bad at IRAC.  

Sometimes, instead of solely relying on my self-grading, I made gemini or chatgpt grade it to keep me honest. ""Am I bullshitting myself here on my self-assessment essay?"" 

I still regret using that whiteboard, though. 

# MPTs: FORM OVER SUBSTANCE! 

For the MPTs, always remember, FORM over SUBSTANCE. I had a lot of practice in law school because we had a mandatory bar prep course that focused on MPTs. I did maybe 3 or 4 throughout bar prep. However, if I didn't have that course, I would do 2 every week until the bar.  

My experience during the bar was absolutely wild. I couldn't copy and paste the rules I typed out as notes, and I said, ""Screw it, I'm just gonna do it as I go."" (I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS). 

Make sure you understand the following: (1) the type of MPT, e.g., memo or brief, etc, (2) tone; (3) headings; and (4) the to-from, date and subject. Some states post old MPT Exams, and they're really great for learning the format.  The last thing I will say about MPTs is that EVERY SINGLE RULE IN THE LIBRARY'S CASES ARE USEFUL, so throw it in your road map/ rule paragraph. 

Remember form over substance. I wrote the worst two MPTs of my life on the Bar. 

Had I not done it in law school, it would have saved me from the whiteboard by at least 1 extra day per week.

# MEE: IRAC, Did What I Did in Law School on the Bar:

For the MEEs, I treated it like law school. IRAC. Know the general rule, the exceptions that go along with it, and so on. Also, you must always remember, some rules require separate IRACs, such as Negligence. Always one broad issue statement at the top, then always sub issues for each element. 

Always include a defense if one is required. Then come to a narrow conclusion. X will likely succeed because he proved all elements of battery when Y intentionally struck him with his whiteboard. 

Always remember the rules, exceptions, and counter arguments, e.g., assault or battery opposed to self-defense. 

Reach a solid conclusion where one party wins. 

# ACTIVE RECALL! 

I cannot stress this enough. **ACTIVE RECALL IS NECESSARY**. What is necessary? **ACTIVE RECALL!** (SPONGE BOB SQUARE PANTS!). I wish I began active recall with *flashcards* earlier (DAY 1). However, from day one, I was doing it with the white board as I previously mentioned. It took me hours to get through some subjects. So again, get those critical pass flashcards and break them down into smaller cards. I wasted so much time scrambling to make them myself two weeks before the exam. 

I probably would have saved the $100 I spent on markers and whiteboards. I was held hostage, honestly. 

# Make up the RULES, MEE. 

**DAY OF THE TEST:** I literally made up rules. **MAKE UP RULES!**  If you have a general idea. Make it up. That's exactly what I did. Keep it very simple, the main elements. 

# My Bar Prep Schedule:  

My Schedule was pretty much 9am to 10pm. However, I can't tell you the amount of times I woke up early to do active recall with the white board or a task bled over into other time blocks. But here's a general idea of how my day was structured: 

1. 9:00am-10:00am Coffee and PRACTICE QUESTIONS, about 15 to 20, and review.
2. 10am-5pm Barbri videos with note taking(give or take).
3. 6pm-7:30pm Dinner/break.
4. 7:30pm-10pm Active recall. (I did practice questions every two days to three days, and if I didn't do MBE practice questions in the morning, then I would do active recall--on the whiteboard--in the morning *and* at night.).
   1. This was kind of therapeutic because it made me feel like I ""knew something."" However, one week out, i couldn't write out another rule on that whiteboard if my life depended on it! 
      1. Stockholm syndrome was diminishing? 

Also note, I would take 15 minute breaks an hour, and complain to whomever was at my house that I didn't know anything. 

# PICK A STRATEGY AND STICK TO IT! 

Don't fumble around like I did. Pick a strategy, flashcards, whiteboard(please, don't), or typing, and stick with it for active recall. I was bouncing around. I wish I had originally chosen flashcards. 

Use flashcards. Burn the whiteboards. 

# IT WILL NEVER FEEL LIKE ENOUGH(at least for me): 

You will never feel like you know enough. I was complaining on every break that I knew nothing. The day of the exam I felt like i knew nothing. When i came home from the exam I felt like I knew nothing. After I took the exam, I felt like I knew nothing. I still feel like I don't know anything. **THIS IS COMPLETELY NORMAL.**  

Guess what, I still feel like I don't know anything. My score doesn't make me feel like I know anything more than prior to knowing it. 

Maybe, I'm Jon Snow?

# Conclusion:

Lastly, I know some of the stuff I said here was redundant, but I think its important to get things down enough to put it into practice. I was a mess throughout bar-prep. Hopefully, you won't be as frantic as I was. My point of writing this is to say, you're not alone. This test is draining. I felt alone, anxious and scared. You can do this! I really believe that active recall is probably the most important thing you could do outside your bar-prep's recommended time, along with adaptibar for MBE questions. 

I did dedicate a lot of time. But the main time drain came from the whiteboard. I think the flash cards would cut it down significantly. I hope my chaotic bar-prep story can help someone else out there, whether you're a first time taker or a retaker. I'm rooting for you!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1oittgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/pinoy/comments/1oittgu/lets_talk_about_uno/,Let's Talk About UNO,"This should be common knowledge na pero marami parin gullible na sumasali. There are many MLM's out there but this post is specifically about Uno (Unlimited Network of Opportunities). It's already in the name duh

How They Get You:

1. I've seen many posts wherein you meet someone from a dating app or Facebook dating groups and they invite you to a cup of coffee. Then they find a way to take you to their office where they will then try to tell you about their network with the help of their colleagues.
2. Syempre since we have social media na, marami silang posts online. They have pages of their ""shops"" wherein they sell the products (hygiene and supplements) of their company. And their personal Facebook accounts are full of ""incentives and achievements"" and what nots. Always showcasing their award ceremonies and pictures of their trips from incentives and all the good times they have because they joined Uno.

An associate of mine is a member of Uno and one time he took me to their office near SM North. Inside I got to see how many ""guests"" there are. Marami talaga. Even though naka aircon na, ang init pa rin sa loob. There are rooms where guys are giving out seminars about god knows what. All the walls are plastered with pictures of people who have become successful from Uno. From what I saw, only a handful are professionals. Most of them are blue-collared workers and even mga tambay. Then there is the general area where members can sit down and talk to their ""guests"" about the glory of Uno and how it made their life better and of course encourage their guest to be their downline.

I got to sit down in the general area with a woman. She showed me their powerpoint and then proceeded to show me how Uno could benefit me if I joined. She even said na low effort lang gagawin ko to earn. I just have to refer someone to the office and they would do all the talking. If that person decides to join, all of the profit is still mine daw. Come on. Everybody in my circle is closed minded and would not even want to dip their toes in this networking pool.

Then she said na another way to be a member is if I avail a package of their products worth 12k. These products are hygiene (shampoo, soaps, lotions, toothpaste, etc) and supplements. She asked me how much I spend on basic hygiene per month. Before I could answer, she said ""siguro mga 1,000"". In my mind I was like, ""what?"" Who in their right mind spends a thousand pesos every month for basic hygiene products. Tbf there are people nga naman who really splurge on their skincare. But I am just an average joe. And you dont consume all your products in a month. They would last at least a month or two more.

Let's make kwenta. In an average shopee store (since duh the general mass knows cheaper yung items dun), here are the prices:

Soap = 53 x 8 = 424  
Kojic Soap = 28 x 8 = 224  
Toothpaste = 70 x 4 = 280  
Lotion = 248 x 5 = 1,240  
Shampoo = 99 x 5 = 495

Total = 2,663.00

Why would I buy a package worth 12k pesos when I can purchase those items for only 2.7k pesos? Tbf, she said I can sell the items naman. Again, my circle are average people living normal lives. They do not have four hundred pesos to splurge on a single bottle of shampoo.

These is another package you can avail pero mga vitamins naman

Again, maraming mga pharmacy diyan that sell those for a cheaper price and you know mas safe pa doon.

Back to the story, the woman was already sensing I was hesitant to join and was having second thoughts. She tagged another guy to give me the talk. This guy said he was a mere construction worker before and was now earning thousands per day (duh from signing bonuses of gullible people). Same sales pitch but more in depth bonuses and what you can earn from your downlines. Then he said, ""Alam ko yung kinakatakutan mo"". And he wrote down the 12k pesos and circled it multiple times. I said yes while trying to look like I wanna join but cannot afford the 12k. I already had my mind made up but I wanna see where he takes this.

He then elaborated dun sa signing bonuses. Na when you get a pair (two people) to be your downline, you automatically get like 1200 pesos. Then everytime your downline gets a pair, you again get a commission. Then so on and so forth (normal pyramid talk). Then he said in the end, ""ito kilala mo pa ba yung mga ito?"". I shook my head no. And he then made his point na the people under me would be working but I still would be getting paid. He even said, ""Nabawi ba yung 12k?"". I said yes but it my mind I was like hell nah.

The thing I know he didn't mention on purpose was that when every pair under your downline joins, your commission or signing bonus decreases. It would be 1200 for the first level, then of course it would decrease on the second level and so on. Syempre hindi mag iistay na 1200 every level, edi super duper yaman na nung mga nasa pinakataas. Baka isang araw palang, ubos na agad funds nila pang gala. So yung point ni kuya na yung mga hindi kong kilala na tao ay binibigyan ako ng pera, that's correct naman. Hindi nga lang sapat yung mabibigay nila for me to quit my job and live in luxury na. Maraming andun sa office na nagsasabi na ilang years na sila sa Uno pero andun parin sa office nageentertain ng guests? Because they need to work their ass off getting people to join directly under them and not their downlines para malaki laki pa yung makukuha nila.

After that, umalis na ako. But I have a friend who had an experience in Uno. He didn't join per he was there during one of their car shows - an event where members show off their newly purchased cars from their income from Uno. He said na marami sila during the event and maraming cars ang naka park. But they're all secondhand. He checked it visually just from the car plates.

Other random thoughts:

1. You can make an income from their packages but that is if you have wealthy colleagues
2. You will only be successful if this is your full time job. Remember the pictures in the walls? A lot of them are not professionals. If you decide to gamble in this journey and leave your full time job, you do you. But remember that you need to work continuously to get downlines. And even if by some miracle everyone in the world has already joined Uno, then what? Who will be your downline?
3. I am not flaming Uno. If you think this is good for you, go ahead. But as an average person, I'm going to take my money elsewhere please. Mas maraming safe na passive income diyan.",1,1761707395.0,pinoy,2,1.0,False
1oits2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/BedroomLab/comments/1oits2a/do_ultrasonic_diffusers_leave_residue/,Do ultrasonic diffusers leave residue?,"yes, ultrasonic diffusers can leave residue‚Äîbut not in the way most people think. The residue isn‚Äôt from the diffuser malfunctioning, but from how ultrasonic technology actually works. Let me explain a bit more in-depth, because this comes up often in aromatherapy and home fragrance discussions, and understanding why it happens helps you prevent it.

Ultrasonic diffusers use high-frequency vibrations to break water and essential oils into microscopic particles, creating that visible cool mist. There‚Äôs no heat involved‚Äîjust mechanical energy. The key detail here is that these diffusers don‚Äôt fully ‚Äúvaporize‚Äù the oil; they simply disperse it into the air as tiny droplets. That means not everything gets atomized perfectly. Heavier or thicker essential oils‚Äîlike sandalwood, patchouli, or vetiver‚Äîtend to separate faster and settle instead of fully diffusing.

What happens next is the ‚Äúresidue‚Äù people notice. Over time, those heavier molecules (and sometimes trace minerals from the water if you‚Äôre using tap water) collect inside the reservoir, on the ultrasonic plate, or even as a faint oily film around the diffuser‚Äôs output vent. If you touch it, it‚Äôll feel slightly greasy or sticky. It‚Äôs not harmful‚Äîit‚Äôs just leftover essential oil that didn‚Äôt make it into the air.

This is one of the main differences between ultrasonic and nebulizing diffusers. A nebulizer uses only pure essential oil and pressurized air‚Äîno water‚Äîso you get a stronger scent throw and no water-based residue. But ultrasonic diffusers trade that intensity for a softer, humidified mist that‚Äôs gentler on the senses and adds moisture to the air.

Now, if you‚Äôre noticing residue quickly or heavily, that‚Äôs usually a sign of a couple of things:

1. **Overusing thicker oils.** Heavier base-note oils don‚Äôt disperse evenly. Try blending them with lighter oils or using fewer drops.
2. **Hard water.** Minerals in the water can create buildup when combined with oil residue. Distilled or filtered water makes a huge difference.
3. **Infrequent cleaning.** Ultrasonic plates are delicate and need regular maintenance. A quick wipe with a soft cloth and a bit of white vinegar after every few uses prevents film buildup.

From personal experience‚ÄîI‚Äôve been using diffusers daily for years in both home and professional environments‚Äîthe difference in maintenance habits is massive. When I first started, I used tap water and never cleaned my unit properly. Within a month, the mist output dropped, and a faint ring formed at the base. Once I switched to distilled water and adopted a regular cleaning routine, the residue problem almost disappeared.

One extra tip: if you‚Äôre diffusing oils with natural color (like orange or blue tansy), the pigment can tint plastic reservoirs over time. That‚Äôs not residue in the technical sense, but it‚Äôs worth noting because it can make your diffuser look dirty even when it‚Äôs not.

So, yes‚Äîultrasonic diffusers do leave a bit of residue, but that‚Äôs inherent to how they function. The key isn‚Äôt trying to eliminate it completely, but understanding it and managing it. Use the right oils, clean regularly, and use clean water. Think of it like maintaining a coffee maker: a little attention keeps it performing beautifully for years.

Once you start treating your diffuser as a piece of precision equipment rather than just a decorative gadget, you‚Äôll notice the difference‚Äînot only in performance but in how your space smells.",1,1761707271.0,BedroomLab,0,1.0,False

Should I cut her off for good?,"How‚Äôs it going? I‚Äôve had this friend who I also have had a history of intimacy with as well as a crush on. Years ago she pursued me, but I hurt her by seeing another girl. Years later we started hanging out again, but she started being hot, and cold, and disappeared for a bit. She was also super flaky and would say she needs alone time but then I‚Äôd see on socials she had time for other friends. This past year we started hanging out, and flirting again, but it never got serious. Still I would consider us at least good friends at this point. Our last time hanging out we were going to get coffee, and making plans to go see a show. She said she had plans to go out of town to see her sister, but she‚Äôd let me know, and it should be cool. We hung out the rest of the time, and everything was good. Weeks later I find out that trip to see her sister was actually a trip with her boyfriend. She had never told me she was seeing anyone. Were also in our late 20s/early 30s

Am I in the right to feel like I was lied to? Obviously she‚Äôs free to date whoever she wants, but I feel deceived that she wouldn‚Äôt just tell me she was going on a trip with her boyfriend.

I was gonna find out anyway and now I‚Äôm more hurt she didn‚Äôt just tell me the truth. I also wonder if she was toying with me, or stringing me along.

I will always be an addict, but there's been many ways I was able to work around my addiction we're over the past 12 years, there has been 13 times where I stopped for 14 days or longer and all the qualities were quite exceptional. However none of them would last upon a relapse.

I haven't smoked any weed in almost 2 weeks now and the first few days we're pretty rough but now it's starting to get a lot better and when I get paid on Halloween, it'll be very tempting to get THC candy. 

I usually smoke flower, but now I've been considering government edibles here which are limited to 10 mg per pack so that may be something I might benefit from. 

At many times weed has absolutely impacted my life very negatively but other times I was recovering from my addiction fairly well. 

I can't be doing this forever especially since I'm unemployed I'd really like to get back to the lifestyle I wanted and actually be able to save up money for things they want to do and travel around Canada. 

It's going to take a lot of work and commitment though to be able to stay off it for a long time again because I really miss my vivid and lucid dreaming.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I am a sales person for some medical AI products. Most days begin with coffee and mess. I start my laptop and deal with emails and missed calls.

For the longest time, I told myself it‚Äôs fine. Everyone has close friends. But over time, little things started stacking up.

Like, she‚Äôd text him every morning. She knows his coffee order. She sends him memes about ‚Äúour chaotic energy.‚Äù He calls her when he‚Äôs stressed before he calls me.

I brushed it off until last week. We were watching TV, and he got a text from her saying, ‚ÄúYou left your charger again üòí guess I‚Äôll keep it hostage.‚Äù

I asked, ‚ÄúWhy were you at her place?‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúShe needed help hanging shelves.‚Äù

That was at 11 p.m.

When I told him that crossed a line, he said I was being controlling and that ‚Äúshe‚Äôs basically my sister.‚Äù But here‚Äôs the kicker, she has a boyfriend, too. I found his Instagram and she hasn‚Äôt posted him once in a year.

So I messaged her boyfriend (I know, probably not my best move). He replied: ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôve been wondering the same thing about them.‚Äù

Upskill NOW for the AI Workforce Revolution ü§ñ (Limited Seats!),"Okay, so, am I the only one feeling like they‚Äôre living in some kind of sci-fi movie all of a sudden? Seriously, AI is *everywhere* now.

It‚Äôs kinda exciting, but also‚Ä¶ terrifying, right? Like, are our jobs even going to *exist* in a few years? I saw this headline the other day about AI writing entire novels and I almost choked on my coffee!

Honestly, it got me thinking. I‚Äôm no tech genius, but I‚Äôm also not about to get left in the dust. So, I‚Äôve been doing some digging, trying to figure out how to actually *use* this stuff to my advantage.

It‚Äôs not just about *knowing* AI exists. It‚Äôs about understanding how it can boost your current skills. Think of it like adding superpowers to what you already do.

*   **Automation is key.** Finding those tasks that AI can take off your plate? Game changer.
*   **Learn prompt engineering!** Seriously. It's the secret sauce to getting AI to do what you want.
*   **Focus on uniquely human skills.** Creativity, critical thinking, empathy... AI can't replicate that (yet!).

But where do you even start, right? It all feels so overwhelming. That's how I felt at least.

Then, I stumbled across this program‚ÄîAutomate It Pro‚Äî(yeah, it has an affiliate link here: [https://whop.com/automateit/automateitpro?a=liveitupdeals](https://whop.com/automateit/automateitpro?a=liveitupdeals)), and honestly, it's been a lifesaver. It‚Äôs about learning to *use* AI, not just being scared of it. It's about automating tasks and making life easier, so you can free up some space for the important stuff in life.

It got me thinking... are we focusing too much on the robots *taking* jobs, and not enough on the *new* jobs they're creating? Jobs that require a *different* skillset, sure, but still‚Ä¶ jobs.

Maybe the real revolution isn't robots replacing us, but robots *augmenting* us. Making us better, faster, stronger (okay, maybe not stronger... *yet*).

I feel normal for the first time in at least 15 years.  I had always, what I believe, self medicated with coffee.  I never enjoyed it, I only felt like I needed it because I was soooo exhausted all the time and my energy and concentration were non existent.

The first week I was still drinking coffee but felt I didn't even need it anymore.  I just did it out of habit and the fear of letting go of that comfort.  Well it's been 10 days now and I haven't had any and the Vyvanse feels smoother.  I also feel calmer and less on edge then the first week or before starting Vyvanse.

Just wondering how many of you decided to stop completely instead of just reducing since Vyvanse seems to work much better for energy, concentration and appetite suppression (something I really needed) than caffeine does.

That's a fair question. We have a body that's been ID'd, we have suspects, we have charges, and we have convictions. Lacey Fletcher's death lead to a guilty plea of manslaughter by her parents. What's the mystery here?

Well, according to Cambridge Dictionary, a mystery is:

>**something**¬†[strange](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/strange)¬†**or not**¬†[known](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/known)¬†**that has not**¬†[yet](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/yet)¬†**been**¬†[explained](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/explain)¬†**or**¬†[understood](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/understood)

And I believe the circumstances around this case fits quite well within this definition. So, without further ado, let's examine the circumstances of this case.

On January 3rd, 2022, at around 2am Lacey's mother Sheila Fletcher called 911 to report her daughter, Lacey wasn't breathing. The circumstances surrounding the 911 call aren't clear, but I've seen it reported the call was prompted by a neighbor noticing Lacey's condition and basically telling the Fletchers if they wouldn't call 911, he would. Dispatch sent a sheriff's deputy to the Fletcher home. Upon arriving, the deputy found 36 year old Lacey Fletcher dead on the family's couch. The circumstances surrounding this finding was shocking.

I can't find much direct testimony from the sheriff who first responded, however what he found caused him to immediately call the county coroner, Dr Ewell Bickham. According to Dr. Bickham, upon approaching the home he ""Opened the door, walked into the house, there was a stench, an odor, feces, fecal material, urine, you couldn‚Äôt hold your breath.""

Lacey Fletcher's body was sunken into what can only be described as an erosion in the couch cushions, her face was covered with feces and red splotches, and her body was surrounded by urine and feces, which pooled into the divot in the couch cushions where her body was found. Additionally, feces was found smeared on her torso and hair. In addition to feces, her hair was knotted and crawling with maggots. Her body also had severe ulcers which were deep enough to expose her bone. Her stomach contents contained feces and foam from the couch cushions where her body was found. Near her body, on a coffee table by the couch, wipes, lotion, and a box containing DVDs of children's movies was recovered. The coroner, Dr. Bickham, determined Lacey had been dead 24-48 hours when the 911 call was made.

These circumstances are obviously horrific, but they also beg the question: How the hell does something like this happen?

Lacey, by all accounts I can find, lived a normal childhood into her teen years. Some of her teachers reporting her falling behind academically and socially in her final year of school, and her parents pulled her out of school in 2002 at the age of 17, and homeschool her for the remainder of her education.

Lacey's parents claim she was diagnosed with social anxiety and autism. Some reports have claimed she had ""locked-in"" syndrome, however I'm not able to verify any of these diagnoses. She was last seen in 2010, exercising outside of the house by a neighbor. Given her death in 2022, it is believed she was confined mostly to the couch where her body was found for 12 years.

Lacey's parents were originally charged with 2nd degree homicide; however they eventually plead guilty to manslaughter in 2024. They are currently serving 20 year sentences

That's more or less where Lacey Fletcher's story ends. Apologies if this ending isn't satisfying, few mysteries are. I do think the following questions need to be asked though:

\-Lacey seemed to have a relatively normal life prior to being pulled out of school in 2002 at the age of 17. What the heck happened?

\-Did Lacey actually suffer from the diagnoses her parents and media claims? I haven't found any reliable testimony from medical professionals that treated her.

\-The 2am 911 call makes no sense. You're telling me Lacey was living on the couch for 12 years, and then her mother just happened to notice she was dead at 2 in the morning, 24-48 hours after she had died? I just don't buy it. Why would the mother be checking on her daughter at such an odd hour of the night? If Lacey had been dead for so long before the 911 call, why wouldn't they have called earlier? Did they not know their daughter was dead during the daylight hours, yet realized it at 2am when she should have been asleep?

\-What was going on with Lacey mentally? Like I said earlier, none of her reported mental health diagnoses have been verified by a medical professional, but obviously mentally healthy people generally aren't found dead on a couch covered in their own feces. What was going on with her mentally?

There's a lot to consider with this case. I wish this write up could include a theory that I could confidently stand behind, but to tell you the truth the more I learn the more baffled I become. I'd love to get some of the community's thoughts.

There are plenty of things we can see: trees, stars, mountains, oceans, people, penguins, our best friend's smile, elephants, skyscrapers, coffee beans, sunsets, and tulips‚Äîto name a few.

God created all those things. He made the natural world, as well as the laws that govern it.¬†

But there are also things we cannot see: behind the breath of the wind, beyond the depths of the universe, beneath the foundations of love. Through Christ, all things were created‚Äîin heaven and on earth, both visible and invisible (Colossians 1:16).

And while our mortal eyes might not be able to see the wind or infrared light or the Spirit of God, we still experience their effects. Because there‚Äôs more than what meets the eye. There‚Äôs more beyond this life.¬†

There's more.

Paul‚Äôs friends, the Corinthians, were experiencing great hardship. They were being hunted and persecuted because of what they believed about Jesus‚Äîthat He was the long-awaited Messiah. Some were even facing death. But Paul encouraged them to endure such fleeting trials with a hope that‚Äôs beyond this world. He wrote:

‚ÄúSo we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠2 Corinthians‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠4‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠18‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NIV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨‚Ä¨‚Ä¨‚Ä¨‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

Human eyes can only see so much. Human minds can only grasp so much. But we can trust God with all that we cannot see or comprehend.

God is real. We might not be able to see Him today, with our physical eyes, but we can experience the effects of His life. Jesus sacrificed Himself so that you might live, and an abundant life awaits you‚Äîboth on earth and in heaven. There is more beyond the here and now.¬†

Breakfast: A toasted cheese sandwich on homemade bread (I'm fancy) with a small glass of plain kefir.  9/10, I love cheese, wish we had blueberry kefir.  Not pictured, coffee with half and half.

Dinner: Rotini pasta with fresh tomatoes, black olives, shreds of prosciutto and chunks of parmesan.  8/10, wanted to add peas to this, realized we didn't have any frozen, oops.

Snack: Tea with milk and sugar, two hobnobs, one plain and one with milk chocolate. 10/10.

Supper: Homemade 15  bean soup with roasted beets, carrots, and celery. I used vegetable and mushroom stock for this so it ended up accidentally vegan. Other variants are canned pumpkin in place of beets with chicken stock.  Two slices of homemade bread with butter. 15/10, I'm really glad I froze leftover roasted beets! 

Snack: On Friday we will celebrate Halloween here in the US.  I feel like full-sized candy is needed here more so than ever, so that's what we're handing out.  As a responsible citizen, I am doing a QC check on the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.  10/10, passed inspection.",3,1761705009.0,recoveryplates,0,1.0,False

For me, the real frugality is about spending smart and bringing the most value in the long run, whether that means saving time, energy, or future expenses. Not sure if anyone else feels this way, but this year I‚Äôve been trying to move from ‚Äòbuying what‚Äôs cheap‚Äô to ‚Äòbuying what‚Äôs right‚Äô.

I live in a small apartment. This year, I bought a large monitor. Studying feels way more efficient, I can look up info and write reports at the same time without switching windows, which keeps me focused. I also got a simple capsule coffee machine. As a coffee lover, it‚Äôs probably the quickest investment to pay off. I usually have breakfast at home, and I‚Äôm not too picky about coffee, so it saves money and fills the place with that nice morning coffee smell. Lastly, I bought a mini robot vacuum from ecovacs. It‚Äôs small but does everything I need, reaches dusty corners, and even helps with my allergies, counts as a little health investment too.  

Since buying these things this year, I haven‚Äôt had any big splurges, and I hope to keep it that way. The idea behind them is the same, make some upfront investments to save more in the long run, anyone follow the same way? Or any investments you‚Äôve made that you feel really paid off?",17,1761704759.0,Frugal,15,0.8,False

1oistzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1oistzn/i_realised_that_everyone_in_our_hometown_thinks/,"I realised that everyone in our hometown thinks my boyfriend is ""weird"" and now i cant stop judging everything he does","I 22F have been with my bf 22F (let's call him R) for 3 years since we went to college. For context: we became super close during covid and spent the next and final year of highschool practically inseparable. We both went to college in different countries and begun dating after a month or two. We had a rough phase the first two years because he would flat out ignore me for 12 hours straight (we had a 8 hours time diference), give me a vague excuse like ""i was sick"" or ""i was doing an assignment"" and I would argue with him to get a proper answer, after which he would apologise sweetly and be give me attention for a couple days till it wore off, but the cycle kept on repeating. I stayed with him (unhappily) because i used to feel like he would change after i told him how his actions made me feel, and also i couldnt handle breaking up just because he used to forget i existed lmao. After i had enough, I had to tell him in bold letters (coz he didn't get it any of the previous times) that this was the final straw and I guess it worked because he changed and became exactly the version of the guy I fell for and he continues to be so since over a year and we are very happy. 

He even told his parents about me and made efforts to do things for me that i couldn't even think he would do. FYI, my parents are strict and dont approve of me dating this ""young"" so the fact that he told his parents about me meant a great deal to me.

This summer we both were in our hometown and I caught up with some old friends from school that I hadn't spoken to for years. When my friend asked me if I had a boyfriend, I said ""oh yeah do you remember R from school?"" and she turned to look at me with a HORRIFIED look on her face and said ""oh my god. What!"". I was so confused and asked her why she reacted that way, she said she just didnt expect me to date him (if it gives context, i was a popular-ish nerd who never dated anyone in school). Then her girl besties came over to meet me and the topic of boyfriends came up and when I said im dating R, one of the girls said, with a disgusted look on her face ""omg ew I hope you aren't talking about R from our grade"" and I literally felt my heart sink. I started questioning why they felt that way because he genuinely is nice to me, and they started citing incidents that made he realise he was, i guess you could say, the ""weird"" guy of our grade.

What they said made me realise that before we even started talking to each other, he had a reputation of doing rather  eccentric things. Like he would say very out of pocket things or make extremely bad cringey jokes hoping that someone would laugh, talking to people in a creepy voice to get a reaction, and fucking up simple tasks on purpose for the onlookers to laugh (eg. dropping a book he was reading out loud for the professor or misspelling easy words on the chalkboard). But these actions didnt get him a nice reputation, it was kind of the opposite. He was part of the cool people group back in school but I remember hearing on multiple occasions, directly and indirectly too, that they justtt tolerate him and i even remember hearing one of them say how they hated sitting next to him in school because he wouldn't shower before school and would stink of sweat. He also had gotten into a few fights with people because he used to spread things that people told him in confidence.

But the thing is, he is completely chill with me, there is no hint of any of the things he would do in the past with me. In fact I had completely forgotten that he used to be like that until my schoolmates reminded me this summer. Later, I spoke to him about it, and his feelings were hurt by how my friends reacted to the news of us dating (very valid reaction) and when I asked him about the way he used to act in the past, he said he ""used to put on a mask"" and dodged my questions and wouldnt give me a direct answer. It made me wonder whether the older verion was the real him or is his current version the real him, given our history of how he used to behave in the start of our relationship vs how instantaneously he switched up to be nice with me now since I threatened to breakup and block him.

A week after that, one of my friends from the ""cool people"" group was in town and im on good terms with her so I went to get coffee with her. She mentioned that I should call R over to meet, and when he showed up, she said on 4 different occasions that its not because she personally wanted to meet him (in the past, she had made it very clear that she doesnt like him) but because her other friends in cool group ""can't imagine"" how R interacts with me because we are a couple, and she later said that they had even asked her to click photos of the three of us together so they could see what we look like as a couple. R and I were weirded out and it was very clear that she just wanted gossip on how we behave as a couple to tell her friends about. 

I do love him very much and I want to spend the rest of my life together but I really can't shake everyone's reaction toward us. Its getting in my head and now im starting to judge things he does and the way he handles things. For better context, he is an only child and his mom is beyond obsessed with him, so I notice a lot of his habits and behaviour that nobody bothered to teach or correct while he was growing up. 

For example: he goes to class without brushing (idk why, he just says its not something that was forced on him to do as a kid) and he desperately needs braces (as said by multiple dentists) but never gets them as theyre ""expensive"" and his mom says his teeth are fine the way they are. He never styles his hair because he wasnt taught that he needs to groom himself unless its a very special occasion and has a ton of dandruff but doesnt listen to any of my remedies because his mom told him to use this shampoo (that didnt work on him). He doesnt take medicines even unless he is extremely sick because his mom isnt on board with using ""heavy drugs"" frequently and thats also why he even doesnt know which meds to take for a fever. He doesnt interact with his classmates or roommates and doesnt have any friends in his city, he just plays video games with his squad (or team whatever, idk the gaming lingo lmao) and talks to me and his parents. 

I get that im judging him in a harsh way, but honestly I cannot say whether im realising the truth or whether its just the people's reactions that have gotten into my head. Im scared I will continue to think of him this way and I dont want to create a permanently negative image of him in my head that I cannot be happy with. If the way I am thinking about him doesnt change soon, I can already tell that the relationship will end and I dont want it to because he understands me and is nice to me, but on the other hand I dont want people from our hometown, to think ""omg she married HIM?!"" and get judged for loving him. In a selfish way, i dont want to feel embarrassed for choosing him. I also understand that even if that was the way he really was before he met me, or if it was an act (i cannot say coz he refused to give me a direct answer), irregardless of how nice he is to me, other people will only think of the old version of him from school. I know I should care less of what people think and all, but the fact that basically everyone from our school thinks that is bugging me out.

I really dont know what to do, id appreciate any suggestions.

TlDR: have been long distance with my bf since we started college, met school friends and they said things that made me realise/remember that he was ""weird"" during school, but he isn't like that with me anymore and since then i am negatively judging the things he does and idk what to do.
