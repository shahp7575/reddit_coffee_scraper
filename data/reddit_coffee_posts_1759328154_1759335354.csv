Just wanted to say, I started saving money a few months ago. Nothing big, just small steps. Like putting a little in a jar or my savings account every week.

I used to spend without thinking. Coffee here, snacks there, random stuff online. Now I try to stop and ask, “Do I really need this?” Most times, the answer is no.

It feels kinda good to see the money grow, even if it’s slow. I’m not perfect, I still buy dumb things sometimes  but I’m trying.",2,1759335060.0,SavingMoney,0,1.0,False
1nvch28,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1nvch28/the_pen/,The Pen,"I don’t even know where this pen came from. Honest. I just found it one morning sitting on my desk, right between my keyboard and coffee cup. No packaging, no note. Just a pen. Heavy, polished, and old-fashioned.

At first, I didn’t think much of it. I wrote a grocery list, a couple to-do notes. It worked fine too, smooth. Almost *too* smooth, like the ink already knew where I wanted it to go.

Later that night, I looked back at the lists I made and there were words I swear I never wrote. Small phrases, neatly tucked between the lines.

*“The floor remembers the sound.”*

*“Do not look under the stairs.”*

*”Sleep cometh not.”*

Cometh not? I laughed it off. Maybe I’d scribbled half-asleep. Maybe my brain was messing with me. But the handwriting, the handwriting was *definitely* mine.

After that, it got stranger.

Sometimes, when the house was quiet, I’d hear a faint scratching from the desk. Like the sound of a nib dragging across paper. And when I went to check, yeah, there they were. Words curling across the page in dark, deliberate strokes. Cursive now.

And true.

The writing wasn’t random. It knew me. My fears, my secrets, things I never told a soul. The words bled out on the page before I even thought them, as if the pen burrowed inside my skull and wrote with my nerves instead of ink.

I tried to get rid of it—the damn thing. I swear I did. I hurled it into the trash, the fire, the street. But every morning, there it lay upon my desk once more. Waiting. Watching. Gleaming with that vile, metallic luster.

And oh, how it whispers now.

Not aloud, no.

It trembles through the very wood of the table, hums behind my ribs, coils about my thoughts with the sweet, suffocating patience of a serpent. At night, the air reeks of parchment and ink. The walls seem to crawl with letters unseen. 

The scratching never ceases; scratch, scratch, scratch, like heartbeat that is not my own.

I begin to wonder with dread…

Have I ever been the writer? Or have I merely been written? For the pen’s strokes are my veins, its ink my blood, and each thought I claim as mine appears already etched, inevitable, ordained.

And tonight, it has carved into my very flesh these words, without my consent, yet with my hand.

1nvcgg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/1nvcgg0/we_went_carfree_for_september_heres_what_happened/,We went car-free for September. Here’s what happened.,"My wife and I live in West Colfax and we both work from home, so we have pretty ideal conditions to comfortably give this a shot.

Let me start by saying we recognize we are fortunate and not everyone has the same opportunities to do what I’m sharing, but I wanted to share our experience.

Here’s a quick summary of the top trips we took:
- We took the W and A Lines to get to the Airport
- Took the Bustang to Steamboat for a weekend with our bikes
- My wife took the FF2/1 to Boulder multiple times to go into the office
- My wife took the LD to Broomfield to meet coworkers for dinner and returned on the 76 + the W Line
- Rode our bikes to Chatfield State Park, the Botanic Gardens, the 39th Ave Greenway, Cherry Creek to visit a plumbing store, Sunnyside, Edgewater, and Downtown for groceries and meals
- Took a Lyft to Boulder to support a friend running the Boulderathon
- Walked to the liquor store, dinner, and coffee on Colfax

A couple of insights after a whole month without driving:
- The train continues to be the best way to get to the airport or downtown - we love it!
- The Bustang is great! But they need to work on their e-bike policy. Lots of confusion between their website, the drivers, and the office. Nobody had concrete answers and it made us nervous about the feasibility of our trip.
- It’s nice having the FF2 back for my wife to quickly get to the office
- The night my wife took the LD was during the Bronco’s MNF game and it showed up 20 mins late without much warning. People were bailing and trying to get on a FF1 which couldn’t even fit the people it already had in line. She took the 76 home from Broomfield which technically had 50 stops along the way so that she didn’t have to wait an extra 30 mins for the next FF1. She mentioned she was a little uneasy traveling at dark too, especially waiting at the Sheridan W Line station.
- Riding our bikes is absolutely our favorite and most convenient way around town, but it’s not without its own stress. People drive like idiots and in West Colfax in particular that have been multiple fatalities in the past few months. That aside, we can jump down into the Gulch and take the path basically anywhere we want and we love it. Riding to Chatfield and stopping for coffee along the path near Littleton, riding all the way across town to the gardens, and visiting the Greenway were some of our favorite parts of the month which made us realize how many gems this region has.
- We had to take a Lyft because the bus wouldn’t get us to Boulder in time for the race! That was very surprising and a bummer - $50 for a 30 minute ride that is normally a $3 ticket.
- And of course walking is always great. We love that we can pop over to Los Mesones for dinner, Brew Culture and Moonflower for coffee, and Seedstock and Odell’s for beers. 

West Colfax still feels like it needs way more businesses for how many people are here so we’re hoping it changes over the next few years.

Overall, I’m thrilled we gave this a shot. We have many car-free friends and it makes me realize the sacrifices they make each day to make this all work. The RTD has many great options but it still needs a lot of work to increase convenience enough for people to give it a chance. Biking will continue to be our go-to option and thankfully it’s feasible all year round with our mild winters.

Unfortunately, I don’t think we’re quite ready to completely give up our car. It’s hard to be the convenience for trips to the mountains or to places with little transit options. We own a home and frequently use our car to carry materials for projects around the house. Additionally, it’s hard to pass it up when the weather _is_ crappy out.

So I started being friends with this girl that's a lot younger than me, but we work in the same industry. I was going through  rough patch with my relationship, and she was undergoing therapy due to childhood trauma. This girl is working extra hours at a coffee shop for money (her parents pay her rent).

Because I'm older and have way more work experience, I've been kind and spending time with her, paying for her small things like beverages, snacks, and giving her rides back to her apartment after we hang out because she doesn't have a car.

She's starting to ask for big favors though, like asking me to drive her 40 min to the airport, driving 40 min one-way to an appointment for her, and she's even asked me to drive her 4 hours to Chicago for an errand.

She's automatically assuming that I can just do stuff for her (and she doesn't even offer to pitch in for gas when I drove her 40 min one-way for her appointment), and I'm starting to feel used. She also constantly talks about herself when we're together so I've basically become her human diary. If I try to tell her something about my life, she just stays silent. So I interact with her, but she doesn't interact with me.

Yesterday I started getting a bit fed up because it starts to feel like I'm just being her chauffeur, and it also starts to feel like she sees me as way closer than I see her. Keep in mind I'm also going through relationship issues, and I'm basically depressed and grieving throughout me giving her all of the help, and feeling like I'm just offering way too much.

Yesterday I sent her a text saying I need to be alone for the entire month of October and I can't help her anymore and I might not respond if she reaches out because I need to focus on myself.

1nvc4ul,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1nvc4ul/energy_drain/,ENERGY DRAIN,"Among the many posts on physical benefits of quitting, something I miss, maybe because it was quite an issue in my case is how nicotine and (I assume) the rest of its toxic buddies sucked the energy out of me. Depending on the period of my life, when I was experiencing a stress surge, I would fall into the habit of smoking the first one even before breakfast, right out of bed. My wife would think this guy is totally fucked up. In that, Id break the rule of my great-involuntary-mentor, i.e. my dad, who died from a sudden heart arrest while taking his routine half an hour nap, a day before my wedding. The man was in the military and a great guy in many aspects, whereas in others square minded as fuck. An atomic bomb might fall, but there was no way he was going to forget his siesta. Anyway, in my entire life I never saw him lightning the first one before his coffee and muffin (combo pertaining to the 85% of the breakfasts along his whole life). I knew, because we know our dads, or rather I learnt that the sequence in his mind was ""I need to get the fuck up from bed and get that coffee and muffin asap to be able to smoke"". In that, hed respect that rule as the good Colonel that he was. 

So I fell into a pattern in which that rule didnt apply. I would wake up so stressed, that (fortunately Im an Adonis almost), I would go out to the balcony in my 100% cotton boxers, oblivious to any possible neighbor looking at me, and would light the first one of the day. Then Id feel relaxed, like the white toxic cylinder did the trick, and I thought to myself ""boy I needed this one"", dopamine getting to my head, and right after putting it out I woudl feel absolutely drained, like I hadnt had any sleep, exhausted, and an exhaustion that would accompany me all through my day, dragging my body until I would go to bed and start all over again the next morning until the day when I would consider my super, duper, mega problems required anti stress nicotine therapy.

And that all folks. Now, with all cravings and the constant struggle, I realized how, the degree to which the cigs were actually turning me into a souless vegetable.

1nvc230,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlogExchange/comments/1nvc230/my_deep_dive_into_a_custom_essay_writing_service/,My Deep Dive into a Custom Essay Writing Service: Honest Review of CustomWritings,"# Why People Turn to a Custom Essay Writing Service

Let’s be real: college and grad school can feel like a full-time job *on top of* your actual full-time job. Between part-time work, internships, family responsibilities, and trying to have some semblance of a social life, it’s easy to hit that wall where you think, *“There’s no way I can finish this paper by Friday.”* That’s where a custom essay writing service enters the chat.

Some folks use these services for proofreading or editing. Others need help when an unexpected crisis pops up—a sick family member, a broken laptop, a sudden workload spike. Whatever the reason, the idea is to have a professional writer help shoulder the burden without sacrificing quality or academic integrity.

I recently spent time exploring [CustomWritings.com](http://CustomWritings.com), one of the longer-standing names in this space. Below is a detailed review of what I found, plus a personal-style narrative of what it’s actually like to order from them.

# First Impressions

Landing on CustomWritings feels clean and straightforward. The site doesn’t drown you in pop-ups or make you dig for basic info. Right on the homepage, you see a price calculator, a description of services, and quick links to get started. For a first-time visitor, that clarity matters.

# What CustomWritings .com Offers

CustomWritings is more than a simple essay mill. Their custom essay writing service covers a surprisingly wide range of academic and professional needs:

•     Academic Essays: Argumentative, narrative, descriptive—if it’s a standard assignment, they’ve got it.

•     Research Papers & Term Papers: Useful for those big semester-end beasts.

•     Coursework & Lab Reports: Ideal for science or engineering majors.

•     Dissertations & Theses: They break it into chapters, proposals, literature reviews, etc.

•     Admissions & Personal Statements: Helpful for grad school or scholarship applications.

•     Business Writing: Think reports, presentations, or even marketing plans.

They also offer editing, proofreading, and rewriting. In other words, it’s not only about someone else writing from scratch—you can get as much or as little help as you want.

# Ordering Process: Surprisingly Simple

I tested their ordering process with a hypothetical psychology research paper (2,000 words, APA format). Here’s how it works:

1.   Fill in the Details: You choose the paper type, academic level, number of pages, deadline, and any specific instructions. They encourage uploading rubrics or example materials, which is nice.

2.   Price Quote: As you tweak deadlines or page counts, the price calculator updates in real time.

3.   Account Creation & Payment: You set up a simple account and pay through standard secure methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.).

4.   Writer Assignment: They match you with a writer based on your subject. You can request a specific writer if you’ve worked with someone before.

5.   Communication Hub: There’s a built-in messaging system so you can chat with your writer, upload additional materials, or clarify instructions.

6.   Draft & Final Paper: Before the deadline, you receive a draft or the completed paper, and you can request free revisions if needed.

The process took me less than five minutes to set up, and the interface is refreshingly uncluttered.

# Pricing: What to Expect

Prices depend on factors like academic level, urgency, and type of paper. As of this writing:

•     Undergrad essays start around $10–$12 per page with a two-week deadline.

•     Graduate-level work or rush orders (e.g., 24 hours) can run $20–$30 per page or more.

That puts them in the middle of the market: not the rock-bottom cheap sites (which can be risky), but not luxury pricing either. They also have:

•     Discounts: Occasional promo codes and a first-time customer discount.

•     Free Features: Title page, bibliography, formatting, and revisions.

•     Money-Back Guarantee: If they can’t meet your requirements or deadline, they promise a full or partial refund.

For transparency, you can see the exact cost before paying—no hidden fees.

# Guarantees & Policies

CustomWritings .com offers some strong assurances:

•     Originality: They run every paper through plagiarism detection software.

•     Confidentiality: Your personal data and order details stay private.

•     Revision Policy: Free revisions within a specified window if the paper doesn’t meet instructions.

•     Money-Back Guarantee: Clear refund policy in case of missed deadlines or quality issues.

These guarantees don’t replace your own due diligence, but they’re reassuring.

# Customer Support

Support is available 24/7 via live chat, email, or phone. I tested the live chat with a few random questions and got helpful answers in under two minutes each time. The reps were polite and didn’t pressure me to place an order.

# A Hypothetical User Experience

Imagine you’re “Sam,” a second-year sociology student juggling two part-time jobs. You’ve got a 10-page paper on urban migration patterns due in three days and a surprise double shift tomorrow. Panic sets in.

Sam heads to CustomWritings, plugs in the details, and sees a price around $160 for a 10-page undergrad paper with a 72-hour turnaround. After paying, Sam messages the assigned writer, “Hey, can you focus on Chicago as a case study?” The writer replies within an hour.

The next evening, Sam receives a partial draft, glances through it during a coffee break, and requests a few tweaks on the introduction. By the deadline, the final version is ready, complete with proper citations and a formatted reference list. Sam double-checks it with Turnitin, finds no plagiarism, and uses it as a guide to rewrite a shorter version in their own words.

This hypothetical shows how someone might responsibly use the service—as a reference or model paper—rather than submitting it verbatim.

# Pros & Cons

Pros

•     Wide Range of Services: From simple essays to PhD dissertations.

•     Transparent Pricing: Real-time calculator with no hidden fees.

•     Quality Control: Built-in plagiarism checks and free revisions.

•     24/7 Support: Quick and helpful.

•     Ease of Use: Smooth ordering process and intuitive interface.

Cons

•     Cost Adds Up: Rush orders or higher-level work can get expensive.

•     Writer Variability: Quality depends on the individual writer (though you can request preferred writers).

•     Ethical Considerations: Always a factor—using these papers as final submissions crosses academic honesty lines.

# Tips & Standout Benefits

Here are a few key takeaways if you’re considering this or any custom essay writing service:

1.   Provide Detailed Instructions: The more info you give—rubrics, samples, formatting—the better the result.

2.   Use the Messaging Feature: Communicate with your writer early to avoid misunderstandings.

3.   Plan Ahead: Longer deadlines = lower prices.

4.   Request Drafts: Helps ensure the paper is on the right track.

5.   Use Responsibly: Treat the final paper as a study aid or model, not a “submit as is” shortcut.

# Reflections & Advice

CustomWritings won’t magically solve every academic challenge, but it can be a lifesaver when you’re overwhelmed. The key is using it wisely. A custom essay writing service should be a tool for learning, not a crutch for cheating.

If you’re a student, think of it as hiring a tutor to demonstrate how a solid paper is structured. For professionals, it can be a way to outsource time-consuming reports or presentations.

Before spending money, ask yourself:

•     Have I clearly defined what I need?

•     Am I using this ethically—as a reference or guide?

•     Can I afford the service without sacrificing essentials?

If the answer is yes, CustomWritings .com is a reputable option with solid features, fair pricing, and a user-friendly experience.

# Final Verdict

In the crowded world of custom writing, CustomWritings .com stands out for its balance of quality, transparency, and customer support. It’s not the cheapest, but you get what you pay for—a professional, well-structured paper and a stress-free process.

Whether you’re an overworked student or a busy professional, this custom essay writing service can provide a valuable safety net when deadlines loom large. Just remember: the best results come when you use it as a learning tool, not a shortcut",1,1759334121.0,BlogExchange,0,1.0,False

1nvc17s,https://www.reddit.com/r/portfolio2video/comments/1nvc17s/is_the_traditional_resume_dead_why_recruiters_now/,Is the Traditional Resume Dead? Why Recruiters Now Prefer Video Introductions,"https://preview.redd.it/7iaixduivisf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=c18637a21eb6de2e18402327686d9a9ce0582de3

The resume you’ve been polishing for years… might already be on life support.

I know. That sounds dramatic. But spend some time lurking on recruiter forums, LinkedIn chatter, or even listening in on hiring managers over coffee — you’ll notice a pattern. They’re tired. Tired of the same black-and-white PDF documents, the endless bullet points, the predictable templates.

One recruiter I met at a career fair laughed when she said it: *“If I see one more ‘results-driven professional with excellent communication skills,’ I might just flip the table.”*

Harsh? Maybe. But real.

# The Problem With Traditional Resumes

Let’s be honest. Most resumes are boring. They all look the same. Same Times New Roman fonts, same “Work Experience” heading, same “Education” block at the bottom.

It’s not that people aren’t qualified. It’s just… paper (or PDF) doesn’t show much about *you*.

Think about it. The way you talk. Your energy. Your personality. None of that comes through. And that’s exactly what employers care about, especially now.

We live in 2025. People swipe right on relationships based on 10-second videos. TikTok makes ordinary people influencers. Short videos can change your whole life.

So why wouldn’t hiring catch up?

# Enter the Video Resume

Here’s the thing. Recruiters started experimenting with video introductions during the pandemic. At first, it was just a “nice extra.” Record a short clip. Say hi. Summarize your skills.

But then… something changed.

Recruiters realized that in *one minute* of video, they learned more about a candidate than in *five pages* of text.

They could hear tone of voice. See confidence. Catch body language. Sense authenticity. And yes — also catch red flags way earlier.

I’ve seen recruiters smile at a shaky video where the candidate said, “Look, I’m not perfect on camera, but I love solving problems, and here’s an example…” That imperfect honesty hit harder than polished bullet points.

One HR lead told me: *“We don’t hire resumes. We hire people. And people don’t live in PDFs.”*

# A Story From the Trenches

Let me give you a quick story.

My friend, Sarah, was applying for a digital marketing role. She had an average resume. Honestly, nothing that screamed “hire me.” She was competing against dozens of others.

Instead of just uploading a PDF, she attached a 90-second video. Shot on her phone. Nothing fancy.

She looked at the camera, smiled, and said:  
“Hey, I’m Sarah. Let me tell you how I got a small bakery in my neighborhood 10,000 Instagram followers in six months — with zero ad spend.”

She explained it with excitement, waving her hands a little. Laughing at small mistakes in her delivery. She looked alive.

Guess what? She got the job. The recruiter told her later: *“Honestly, your resume was fine. But your video? That sold me.”*

# Why Recruiters Like It

Let’s break it down:

* **Efficiency.** In 60 seconds, they get a feel for you. Faster than scanning bullet points.
* **Personality check.** Some jobs need energy. Some need calm confidence. Hard to see that on paper.
* **Real communication.** Employers want people who can speak clearly, not just write well.
* **Memorability.** Who stands out more? “John Doe, Software Engineer” on paper? Or John Doe smiling on video, saying, “I love building things that actually help people.”

There’s also another angle. Bias reduction. Traditional resumes sometimes highlight things like age, gender, or school pedigree in ways that subtly trigger bias. Video isn’t perfect — but recruiters argue they can cut through generic words faster and focus on “fit.”

# But Wait. Aren’t Video Resumes Risky?

Yes. Let’s be real.

Some candidates feel video favors extroverts. Or that it adds pressure to look a certain way. That’s valid. Not everyone is comfortable.

There are also accessibility issues. Not everyone has high-quality cameras, fast internet, or quiet spaces.

And yes, biases can creep in visually, too. The way someone looks. Their accent. Their background. Humans are messy.

But here’s the thing: many recruiters aren’t asking for Hollywood-level editing. They’re not expecting you to be an influencer. They just want to see if you can introduce yourself like a human.

Simple. Casual. Honest. That’s it.

# The Hybrid Future

So, is the traditional resume *completely* dead? Not yet. Companies still need structured data — dates, job titles, education history. Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) still eat PDFs for breakfast.

But here’s the trend: paper (or PDF) is becoming the **foundation**, and video is becoming the **highlight reel**.

Think of it like sports. The full game stats (resume) are there for reference. But the highlight video? That’s what excites people. That’s what makes coaches pay attention.

Recruiters in creative fields — design, marketing, sales — are already leaning hard into this. Tech companies too. Even finance is testing it out.

The future probably looks like this: upload your resume → attach a short video → maybe even link a digital portfolio. Multi-format storytelling.

# How To Make One Without Looking Silly

Quick advice, if you’re curious:

* **Keep it short.** 60–90 seconds. No one wants a TED Talk.
* **Be yourself.** If you’re funny, be funny. If you’re calm, be calm. Don’t fake energy.
* **Tell one story.** Don’t list everything. Share one example that shows your skill.
* **Don’t overthink tech.** Your phone camera + natural light is enough.
* **Smile. Pause. Breathe.** You don’t have to be perfect.

Recruiters will forgive small “ums” and stumbles. In fact, that can make you look human.

# Final Thoughts

So, is the traditional resume dead?

Not buried. Not yet. But it’s on the way out as the *star of the show*. Video is stealing the spotlight.

Hiring has always been about human connection. About trust. About, “Do I want to work with this person every day?”

Text on a page can’t answer that. But your voice, your eyes, your story? They can.

Maybe it’s time to stop obsessing over that perfect bullet point. And start hitting “record.”

Because the truth is — recruiters aren’t just reading anymore.

They’re watching.

Hit me up if you think I sound like someone you would like to know. I am open to meeting anyone. I don't care about your age, sex, race or orientation. I lean left, so you are all welcome with me!

I (43F) have been struggling since I moved here in late 2021. I fell into a deep depression due to the move and the winter weather. In 2023, as soon as I started to acclimate to the area, our senior dog passed away. Six months later, in 2024, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I underwent a double mastectomy and I had a complete hysterectomy this year to treat it. Now that I am healthy, I would really like to make some friends. 

I am a housewife, and I spend most of my time at home with my retired husband and our rescue dog that we adopted last year.

I have Celiac Disease, which means I follow a strict Gluten-Free diet. I make all of my own meals, and I have become a really good cook and baker because of all the practice I get. I also eat way too much candy. I will count calories to be sure that I can have a chocolate bar, or some kind of treat every day. 

Because I live to eat, I have to offset those snacks somewhere, so I got into The Conquerer Challenges. I'm working on my 27th medal right now, and despite two surgeries, I have walked almost 500 miles so far this year. I usually walk my dog 1-3 miles per day around my neighborhood or my local park. 

I'm open to trying new low-impact activities. I like yoga and I swim a little in the summer. 

When I'm not eating or walking the dog, I like to doom-scroll Reddit, cross stitch or needlepoint, watch TV, listen to music, and smoke weed. Check out my profile for some of my cross stitch projects and gluten-free bakes. You can find my dog tax there, too.

I wear one earbud constantly, and I even sleep with one in. Corporate Avenger, Snotty Nose Rez Kids, and Hyro the Hero are getting the most action in my playlist right now. I like all kinds of music, but the pissed-off, aggressive stuff is my favorite. 

If you are still reading, and would like to meet up for a walk or coffee somewhere, DM me. I can't wait to meet you!

I've had a couple of he said/she said situations, nothing I would consider career ending, more like embarrassing socially. ie - Roommate confrontations that had some immaturity mixed in behavior wise, that went sideways. Getting drunk and grabbing a mic from a live band during their set. This happened once and I was TRASHED. (I still take responsibility) Stuff that's more like this.   
  
At this point, I doubt the real truth about any of these situations is being communicated to any parties, but I can't deny the effect its had on my life.  
  
A lot of my connections have gone ghost on me, and even friendly interactions in my neighborhood have turned sour. Old friends I used to play music with, too -- these are people I shared some great times with.   
  
There's this guy that I met in a local coffee shop I go to every morning that once heard me playing music from my house.  We started some friendly banter and greetings every morning, and he started ignoring me once learning my full name. He mentioned he was plugged into the music scene and regularly booked bands. 

The thing is, I could most likely prove these situations are half truths/largely lies with text messages, etc but I just don't think it will make a difference here.

The cool thing is I play each instrument, and song-write, so I really don't need anyone's support. It's hard to stomach this happening, but I think it might be almost fully out of my control.   
  
Does anyone have any suggestions? My gut tells me I'm fucked and my character will only take me so far for those that are willing to get to know me despite all the noise.

But the real lessons weren't about the time saved - more about the subtle failures that taught me how AI agents actually work in production.

**The Problem Nobody Talks About**

Sk00l's hobby plan forces you to manually approve members. You're on your phone, someone applies, and you either:

* Ignore them until you're home (killing engagement)
* Switch between Sk00l and clunky google sheets to do data entry on your phone
* Upgrade to a $100 paid plan just for auto-approvals

I chose option 4: build a Telegram bot that reads the screenshot, validates the data, and logs it to Google Sheets while I'm literally anywhere.

# 🔥 Lesson 1: The Image Analysis Trap (And How to Escape It)

**What I tried first:** Just throw the Sk00l approval screenshot at an AI image analyzer and extract the text.

**Reality check:** AI models are surprisingly terrible at reading emails from images. Here's why:

* Gmail addresses use random characters (like johnde41@gmail.com)
* AI models are trained on natural language, not random character strings
* They consistently miss single characters, add extras, or swap similar-looking ones

**My solution cascade:**

    1. Test multiple models (Anthropic, Gemini, OpenAI)
       → Different models fail differently on character recognition
    
    2. Validate EVERY email with Hunter.io immediately
       → Catches the ~30% of emails that get misread
       
    3. Human-in-the-loop fallback for failed validations
       → Telegram prompts me to manually enter just the email

**Why this matters:** You can't just throw AI at a problem and walk away. Layer your defenses. Vision → Validation → Fallback. That's production-grade automation.

**💡 Pro tip:** Hunter.io's API has a generous free tier (100 validations/month). For Sk00l communities with <100 monthly signups, you'll never hit the limit.

# 🎯 Lesson 2: The distinction behind using a YouTube API vs it being a tool to an AI Agent

**Initial approach:** Use YouTube API directly to fetch video details from user-provided links.

**Problem:** OCR misreads URLs constantly. Classic errors:

* O vs o vs 0
* Capital I vs lowercase L
* Missing or extra characters

**The API fails immediately.** No retry logic, no smart handling.

**Solution:** Wrap YouTube tools in an AI Agent with these instructions:

    ""If a tool call fails:
    1. Systematically try character substitutions
    2. Prioritize common OCR errors (l→I, O→0)
    3. Iterate until you get valid video data
    4. Use the Think tool to reason about corrections""
    

**The game-changer:** Instead of failing immediately, the agent tries variations:

1. `dQw4w9WgXcQ` (original OCR result) → fails
2. `dQw4w9WqXcQ` (g→q) → fails
3. `dQw4w9WgXcQ` (revert) → **success!**

**Why this matters:** This taught me the fundamental difference between:

* **API calls** = rigid, fail-fast, require perfect input
* **AI Agent tools** = flexible, can retry with different strategies, self-correct

The agent essentially gave my workflow ""soft error handling"" that standard APIs can't provide.

# 🛡️ Lesson 3: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Isn't Just for Verification – It's Your Best Fallback

Everyone talks about HITL for *checking* AI decisions. But here's what changed my perspective:

**Traditional HITL thinking:**

    AI does task → Human verifies → Approve/Reject
    

**What I found:**

    AI attempts task → 
      ├─ Success (92%)? → Auto-log to spreadsheet ✅
      └─ Failure (8%)? → Telegram asks me to manually input email ⚡
    

When [Hunter.io](http://Hunter.io) flags an invalid email, instead of logging garbage data or failing silently, the workflow sends me this:

    ❌ Failed to read email from screenshot
    ✏️ Please reply with the correct email address
    

I type the email, hit send, and the workflow continues. 

**The epiphany:** HITL shouldn't be a ""check everything"" bottleneck. It should be a *surgical intervention* for the 5-10% of edge cases where AI genuinely struggles.

In my case:

* **Without HITL:** 100% manual data entry (5 min per applicant)
* **With HITL (wrong approach):** AI processes, I verify all (still 3 min per applicant)
* **With HITL (right approach):** AI handles 92% automatically, I intervene only on failures (30 sec average per applicant)

# 📊 Lesson 4: Email Validation Isn't Optional – It's the Difference Between a Database With Actual Value and a Dumpster Fire

Here's the brutal truth I learned after my first week:

**Without email validation:**

* 47 new members added to my ""CRM""
* Sent first campaign
* **31% bounce rate** 💀

All that automation effort was wasted because I was logging [`j0hn@gmaII.com`](mailto:j0hn@gmaII.com) instead of `john@gmail.com`.

**After adding Hunter.io:**

* Same 47 members
* Same workflow
* **3% bounce rate** (industry average) 

**Why this matters:** If you're building ANY workflow that collects emails, validation isn't a ""nice to have"" - it's table stakes. You're either validating emails or you're wasting your time.

# 🔥 Bonus Lesson: The ""Strike While the Iron Is Hot"" Problem

The original problem wasn't *just* about saving time. It was about **response speed**.

When someone joins your Sk00l community (anecdotal data meant for illustration):

* **Immediate approval** = 78% go on to post intro 
* **2-hour delay** = 41% post intro
* **Next day approval** = 19% post intro

By automating approvals via Telegram, I can approve members from:

* The gym (yes, between sets)
* Coffee shops
* Even concerts (okay, maybe not ideal)

The point: **Automation isn't just about efficiency – it's about being able to act when timing matters most.**

# 🎁 Key Takeaways

1. **Layer your AI defenses:** Vision model → Validation API → Human fallback. Never rely on a single AI call for critical data.
2. **AI Agents > Standard APIs for fuzzy problems:** When input quality is uncertain (OCR, voice-to-text, user-entered data), agents with retry logic crush static API calls.
3. **HITL should be surgical, not universal:** Design workflows where humans intervene only on the 5-10% of cases AI genuinely can't handle.
4. **Always validate emails:** Period. No exceptions. [Hunter.io](http://Hunter.io), ZeroBounce, doesn't matter – just validate.
5. **Mobile-first automation unlocks timing advantages:** Being able to act from your phone isn't just convenient – it's strategically valuable.

If you're on Sk00l's hobby plan and doing manual approvals, this workflow is legitimately life-changing. Happy to share the n8n JSON if anyone wants to clone it.",0,1759333549.0,n8n,0,0.33,False

When I got here, I immediately applied for jobs but almost all required an EIT, so I scheduled my FE exam last June. Since I graduated 11 years ago, I had no idea how to start studying again—especially since my weakest subjects are dynamics and math (particularly probability). Thankfully, I had a strong foundation in statics!

Study materials I used:
	•	NCEES practice exams (50Q & 100Q) → solved them repeatedly until I almost memorized them
	•	YouTube (MM & Islam) → for clearer explanations
	•	PrepFE (1-month subscription) → practiced timed questions to train under pressure (my scores were 75%–90%)

Study routine:
	•	Prepared for about 2.5–3 months
	•	Studied 6–7 hours daily (usually 8 PM – 3 AM since I’m more active at night)
	•	Two weeks before the exam: shifted my study time to match the actual exam hours (8 AM – 2 PM)
	•	One week before: chill review, just reading

Exam day:
	•	Woke up at 6 AM, had a heavy breakfast and coffee, brought snacks
	•	At the test center by 7:20 AM, seated by 7:40 AM, started the exam
	•	Morning session: 53 questions, flagged about 10
	•	Took a 25-minute break (ate and relaxed)
	•	Afternoon session: 57 questions, flagged about 25, but solved around 7–10 upon review (15 left flagged)
	•	Finished with 47 minutes remaining, but ended early since I couldn’t solve the last flagged ones

I am definitely an extrovert I made some huge changes 2 years ago and completely rebuilt my life, I eat nothing but healthy now, Work all day on my own projects ( and some client work ) with full motivation, Have no addictions at all. Basically I came from not being able to control myself to not being able to stop myself from doing what I love doing.

In the process I completely changed as a person, I don’t go out with my old friends my social battery is there I know it’s there, Just now it doesn’t allow me to sit with people who are about fun and games. I take a lot of interest in people who are about growing, doing, making stuff, risking but it’s hard to find those.

I noticed this when I sat with my cousins in a coffee shop, It took me 15 minutes of sitting there listening to their talks and then just being super annoyed. It’s like I can’t even connect with people any more.

It’s like fighting a new war now, should I keep the amends and hang on and deal with things I don’t like doing anymore or let go and be left alone until I find the people who match the energy and discipline.

I can sit a whole day working on my own projects from am to pm not losing any sign of flow but it is the hardest thing in the world for me to reach out to my group of friends, hangout, spend some time.

I’m 5'8, wear glasses, brown skin, dark hair and eyes. I work as a software developer. I don’t smoke or drink. I’m Christian, and my faith matters to me, but I’m open to anyone who respects that.

I’m a bit introverted at first, but once I’m comfortable I talk a lot, stay loyal, and keep things consistent. I don’t like drama - I prefer slow and steady connections where we can take time to know each other.

Most evenings are simple: coffee, soft music, and a good show. I enjoy small chats about how the day went, sharing songs, laughing at funny scenes, and making little plans we actually do.

I like anime and K-dramas (Naruto and Demon Slayer are favorites), Turkish shows, and story-driven movies. I listen to all kinds of music and love finding new tracks for late-night playlists. I cook simple meals, enjoy hiking, quiet walks, stargazing, and I’d pick a museum or café over a party any day. I used to game a lot, now it’s just Genshin once in a while. I love travel (Japan and Switzerland are dream spots), but I also enjoy calm weekends at home.

I’m looking for someone kind, steady, and emotionally open. Long distance is fine if both try equally. If it feels right, I’m open to closing the gap.

I know im hurting a lot. My heart feels heavy and low all the time. I dont know what to do. Sometimes I feel like theres no point anymore. 


***** Long story ahead******

I got married when I was 18. We were young and stupid. I grew up poor and so did he. We ended up pregnant within the first year of marriage. (Religious). Not religious anymore tho. 

We ended up having 3 kids overall, each within 2 years of each other. Not on purpose just no protection bc we were idiots. We had no family support on either side, no money. 

Over the years, we build a somewhat stable life for our family. He got a good steel mill job, we lived in a 3 bedroom trailer for a good while. It wasnt bad... out in the country. He worked 65-70 hours a week. We had one car.  But our little life was beautiful honestly. I stayed home with the kids mainly but had a part time job and they could come with me. My kids came with me everywhere. We didnt have enough money for a sitter, and we didnt have famiky help. My mom is severe schizo and my dad isn't in my life and his family not in the picture. I cooked every meal by scratch and including snacks. Good, healthy food. My kids were always well loved, well fed, well dressed, taken care of. They were always with me. I had no friends bc I was always at home without a car. Maybe I was depressed but idk. I loved my husband and my life and I thought it was beautiful although I was tired sometimes. I spent a lot of time alone with my babies. 

When the kids started school, I was there for every event. Every party. Every field trip. I was room mom for all 3 classrooms. I took them to do activities and spent all my time with them. I love them so much.

Then everything fell apart. 

I was on a 2 day field trip for my oldest daughters class. It was a camping trip and I was a chaperone. 
When we got back, we were driving to McDonald's with my now ex husband and he had his phone on the dash. A text popped up. It was a woman. 

He mended it that night initially with me, explaining that it was only online. 

He went to work the next day, and I dug. I bought some services and found out... he didnt tell me the entire truth. He had been talking to multiple women online everyday for a year but the kicker was... he was also involved with a female  coworker for over a year and I had no clue. No suspicion. 

I was devastated. I lost 20 pounds, couldn't eat, couldn't sleep. I was heartbroken. 

I tried to stay and work with him about 4 mknths..  the trust was gone. We slept in separate bedrooms. 

I knew someone states away that offered me a free place to stay, to get on my feet during the divorce since I had been a stay at home mom basically for 11 years. I packed my bags in thr middle of the night and left. It was 10 hours away. 

That was 5 years ago. 

Fast forward to today. Im a completely different person in good ways. I am outgoing, social, have a stable job that I am very good at, have friends that are my family. 

Ex husband ended up following me out here with the kids and got a house 40 minutes away. Due to my work hours ( nights) I would get the kids on my weekends (Sundays, mondays, tuesdays) and he had them for the school week. Per the divorce, we have split custody 50/50 but this is what worked. 

I don't have any savings and I do have a roof over my head but no car. I have a roommate and not a lot of space for 3 kids here but I was making do for them. 

I have been trying to save, but I make only enough to survive basically its been rough. Ive been wanting to get into my own to have space for them, but its like one steps forward 10 steps back all the time. I get a little ahead and something always happens. 

I dont have any to ask for financial support or help except me and im making it work but its been hard, esp after the divorce when I was supporting the family by staying at home and he was working so much. 

I left th divorce with nothing because legally I was entitled to half his retirement and he asked me to leave it if he would help me out when I needed it and I agreed. But then he stopped helping me. I was screwed. I did it to myself. 

But I was putting in so much efforts just for my kids and even if I cant be the best mom, I love them so much with all my heart and I want nothing but for them to thrive.

Recently, some things happened. I dont speak with my sister (for good reason, she was with a guy 20 years older then her and he does hard drugs). A couple months ago, my kids were supposed to come to my house on my days I always get them. I messaged my oldest daughter and she said my sister had come to pick them up and take them back home for a couple weeks (10 hours away). This really upset me because 1, I dont talk to my sister and 2, not a single person told me that was happening. 

I felt so disrespected. 

I didnt mention about a year ago, my ex-husband got a new fiance. She moved in right away and I have heard stories from my oldest that she's not pleasant. 

She literally hates me. For months she wouldn't even introduce herself to me dropping and picking my kids up. We used to do parent very well amd when she stepped in, suddenly im not allowed in the house, she made my ex husband block me, she's called me names and bad mouthed me to my kids. 

I tried to reach out and grab coffee with her and she refused and said its inappropriate. 

When I finally introduced myself it was on Thanksgiving last year and me and my bf went into the house and I met her. She wouldn't look me in the eyes. My oldest told me she cried to my ex husband about me coming in thr house even tho I was so polite amd nice to her. I wanted to meet who had been living with my kids. 

Shes been trying to push me out of their lives. Shes over and over disrespected me with words when i message her about the kids. I dont care about my ex husband but people who have kids together need to coparent and I was trying. She literally wanted me gone and i tried so hard to make it work. 

After finding out my sister came to get my kids, I was livid. Not because she got them,  but because they had disrespected me as a mother so much up until that point that for them not even to mention that to me ... idk. I was livid. I went off the rails. I told her, if she wanted me out of their lives so much then so be it. Im already failing as a mother, no place for them to stay, not enough money, no car, work nights .... then I just give up. 

I havent spoken to my kids since. I've been blocked on everything for them. And her and my ex husband and my sister. 

Yesterday was my oldest 16th bday. i wrote each of my children letters and wanted to send them but I am blocked from everyone. 

My heart hurts so bad. Ever since that fight with the fiancé (now wife as of this month), I have dreamt of them over and over every single night. I think of them all the time. All I want is for them to be happy. I miss them so much and I wish I was a better mother. Someone who has their life together someone worthy. I dream of them all the time. Of protecting them. I really really miss my kids. 

I dont know what to do. I dont know if they'll just be better off without me in their lives. If they'll be happier, more stable, have a roof and food and a car and a new step mom. 

I hope one day, they can understand and not hate me forever. I miss their voices, their laughs, their jokes, their cries, i miss when they were crabby, happy, annoying. I miss their energy. I miss every little thing about them. 

I hope they know I love them. Sometimes i dont see a point to keep going on. But I have hope that if I keep trying maybe one day I can have a house for them, a car and a stable enough income. One day I hope they know I love them and miss them. I hope its soon. 

Anyways. Thats my confession. Somewhere I can get this out. 

I can talk to my bf but he can be mean about it by saying well why cant you talk to them? Why cant you message her? I am blocked. I dont know how to fix things. I dont know what I can do. 

So do your worst. Judge me for being a horrible mother. I had to get this out.

This time, after the mods matched us, we started chatting again, talk for a bit, and moved to Instagram. We talked about family backgrounds, childhood stories, and eventually decided to meet up at Kedai Sesama, Cikini

At the cafe, I ordered bakmi ayam manis with butter coffee + iced sweet tea, while he got bakmi ayam biasa and iced coconut milk. While eating, our conversation just kept flowing, about public transportation, tea, languages, cultural differences between Indonesia and France, life perspectives… honestly, I even forgot half of what we talked about karena saking banyaknya wkwkwkwk

After that, we went looking for a photobooth. First stop: Kopikina, a nearby café displaying historical paintings and even some sculptures outside (he actually took a pic of one of the statues 😄). But the photobooth there had a long line, so we decided to go to Blok M and walk towards Cikini Station while still chatting about pedestrian life in Jakarta, Mataram, and France

On the train, we got into a random but super interesting convo about railways, like how in Sumatera there are still trains using steam and diesel engines. That was new info for me and kinda cool to know

Finally, we reached Blok M. I accompanied him to buy glasses, then we tried another photobooth around the area. Again, super long waiting list and even worse (1.5 hours!), so we ended up doing the photobox at MRT Blok M station instead karena cuma di situ yg ga ngantri loooll

We called it a day after that. It was fun, wholesome, and way more insightful than I expected from a ""blind date."" Wishing him all the best for his studies and work ahead

If you’ve been around Bitcoin for a while, you already know one thing—sometimes sending and receiving crypto can feel like juggling flaming torches. Wallet addresses are long, clunky, and easy to mess up. One wrong character and—poof!—your coins are gone forever. Not fun. That’s why QR codes have become the unsung heroes of Bitcoin transactions, and why tools like the **free Bitcoin QR Code Maker app** are game-changers. Pair that with the rise of Bitcoin BTMs (Bitcoin Teller Machines), and suddenly the once-intimidating world of digital money feels a whole lot friendlier.

Let’s break it down.

# QR Codes: Bitcoin’s Shortcut Button

Imagine explaining a Bitcoin address to your grandma. “Just copy and paste 34 random letters and numbers, double-check them three times, and hope you don’t miss a digit.” Yeah, no thanks. QR codes swoop in like superheroes, compressing those long addresses into a neat little black-and-white square. With one quick scan—bam!—your wallet knows exactly where to send or receive Bitcoin. No typos. No stress. Just smooth sailing.

And that’s where the **Bitcoin QR Code Maker app** comes in. Over at [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), you can generate a custom Bitcoin QR code for free in seconds. Whether you’re a small business owner accepting Bitcoin, a developer testing apps, or just someone who’s tired of copying long addresses by hand, this tool has your back.

Even better, you can create **payment links and buttons** too. So if you run a website or want to collect donations in Bitcoin, you’re not stuck explaining wallet addresses to people. Just drop a button on your site, and boom—you’re in business.

# BTMs: Bitcoin Meets the Real World

Now let’s talk about Bitcoin BTMs (yep, Bitcoin Teller Machines). Think of them as ATMs but for the digital age. Instead of withdrawing dusty old fiat bills, you can buy or sell Bitcoin with cash in minutes. Walk up, insert cash, scan your wallet’s QR code, and the machine sends Bitcoin straight to you. Easy.

BTMs are especially handy for beginners who don’t want to wade through complicated exchanges. They’re also a bridge between the physical and digital financial worlds. Some even let you sell Bitcoin for cash, which means you can grab coffee money straight from your crypto wallet.

The best part? QR codes make BTMs super simple to use. Instead of typing in your Bitcoin address (please, no one wants to do that), you just scan your code, and the machine takes care of the rest. It’s fast, intuitive, and way less stressful.

# QR Codes + BTMs = Bitcoin Made Simple

Here’s the magic: combine the **Bitcoin QR Code Maker app** with the convenience of BTMs, and suddenly Bitcoin feels as easy as Venmo or PayPal—but with the bonus of being decentralized and global. No banks, no middlemen, no 3–5 business day nonsense. Just pure, borderless money.

So whether you’re creating QR codes for your business, setting up payment buttons on your website, or grabbing Bitcoin from a BTM down the street, tools like [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) make the experience smoother, faster, and way more fun.

Bitcoin doesn’t have to be complicated. With a simple QR code and a friendly BTM, the future of money is literally just one scan away.",1,1759333279.0,u_SelectionOptimal7348,0,1.0,False

* tl;dr: Recommend for people with wide feet looking for an ergonomic shoe.

Hi all, just an amateur cyclist here with relatively wide hobbit-esque feet. I recently tried a new shoe, Strong Feet Athletics' ""Leviathan"" and gotta say, ***they're probably the most comfortable cycling shoe I've ever used.*** And I wanted to provide my experience and maybe some micro-exposure to a new brand on the market. I've only put about 50 miles on them so far, on a mix of gravel and road cycling, but so far I'm impressed, they're roomy, comfortable, fit well, and let me cycle in peace.

INFO:
[Link to the site here](https://www.strongfeetathletics.com/).
And [Pic here](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/649de6c51c1a095d228f1628/b68851d3-ea57-4e4f-8488-107e2e9066be/SFA-Smoke-360-p4-1-1500px.gif?format=1500w), stolen from their site.

⸻

**What I'm coming from:** Just as an intro, before the Leviathans, I've been using a pair of Lake CX somethings, which have served me well, were iridescent purple, and I felt very pro everytime I cinched up my BOAs. 

To get my Lakes to fit however, I think I had to size up one size to US 9, even on their widest last, and they were definitely snug and compressed my toes ever so slightly. I'd rate the fit of my Lakes at an 7.6 to 8.7 in comfort, depending on my choice of socks and my feet on a given day, and thought that's the best a cycling shoe could get me without going custom. 

⸻

**Why:** In search of a more comfortable shoe for longer distance cycling however, I decided to give the Leviathans a try, because even superficially, they looked like they would give my toe box a lot of space, and they had good positioning on the soles for my speedplay cleats. And at the risk of good product photography masking how they would look in real life, I found them good looking, especially in white, and my biggest concern was ""clown shoe""-itis (a real concern to us vain cyclists) if the product photography hid the curves too well. **Luckily, this was not the case in real life, the shoes do suffer a bit from ""croc"" roundness, but it's not offensive.** 

⸻

**Ordering and Delivery:** Their website only has a single product as of now, the Leviathan shoes, and I used their measuring guide to check my feet and order the right size, a size 40 in white. The [sizing guide](https://www.strongfeetathletics.com/s/SFA-Sizing-Guide-July-2024-small-mr43.pdf) appeared well laid out, and I measured my feet a few times for accuracy. Ordering was easy, shipping took 2-3 days to LA, and they cost as of this writeup $299 + Tax. I think S+H was free in the US.  

⸻

**The good stuff, the shoes:** So, out of the box the shoes seemed pretty quality, made with 2 BOA style cinches (which actually were better than BOAs to use, as a simple reverse twist released all tension). I found the BOA style cinches easy to use, and they worked at least as well as the real BOAs on my Lakes The uppers are made with a synthetic leather that I find pretty indistinguishable from the real thing, and the sole is carbon, with these nice red rubber TPU ""pads"" that prevent scuffing, though some tiny scuffs have already appeared on the soles of my pair. 

**Fit:** Fit wise, they really did what they promised to do. I now have a roomy, comfortable shoe, that had a flat platform so I could stomp on the pedals. The shoes fit me well, they conformed well to my heel and midfoot, had a standard foam insert, and were roomy without being cavernous for my toes and the widest part of my feet. While YMMV, I found some literature and the diagrams of feet that various online reviews and youtube videos moderately persuasive, so I encourage people to check out those resources if they think they might fit these shoes as well.  

**Design:** I was initially worried about the rounded toe box being too bulbous, but I found it inoffensive and while not as sleek as my Lakes, the comfort is 1000% worth the trade off. In fact, the design of the Leviathans does a pretty good job of minimizing any clown shoe effect, and if you think the shoes do look a bit bulbous, I mean, the majority of us voluntarily wear lycra and skintight clothes once a week... 

I'll say that the design of the shoes themselves ranges from passably good, to great. 

**Riding Comfort:** As alluded above, these shoes are comfortable, appear to made from good/premium materials, and accepted my speedplay cleats with a 3 bolt adapter. So far, I've done a combination of light gravel and road biking, about 50 miles, and I really have no complaints - **my feet are comfortable and it feels like I'm pedaling on clouds** if I'm not being hyperbolic. 

**Cleaning:** **On my first ride, my nice white cycling shoes got mud and dirt on them.** Unlike you all, I may have fallen off my bike in an unfortunate clipping related accident totally the fault of the cleats and definitely not because I was a bonehead (it was because I was a bonehead trying to creep forward between narrow obstacles on a trail with only one foot clipped in). But, the shoes took the mud like a champ and I later just wiped them off with some water from my bottle and my thumb while I was waiting for a coffee at a pit stop. The only issue was the fabric ""band"" of the upper retained a bit of dirt coloring, which faded with each application of water and scrubbing until it's 99.9% gone. I'm sure if I use a detergent right now and a toothbrush, it'll be cleaner than new. I'm very happy because visually, except for some minor scuffs on the carbon sole, the shoes look brand new and immaculate - which you want to preserve as long as possible when you have white cycling shoes. 

⸻

**Verdict:** Recommend. These shoes are comfortable, took my abuse, look passably good to great, and cost a moderate penny at $299. I'm sure custom options clock in higher, but an anatomically designed shoe that looks halfway decent at this price point seems a nice enough proposition I thought to do a little writeup about it. 

⸻

**Disclaimer:** And I have no association with them, I'm just jazzed that I found a really comfortable shoe to help me put down my gentleman's 150 watts efficiently (that's a joke, it's actually 155 watts [joke too]).",0,1759333240.0,cycling,2,0.5,False

The App gave me a free slice of cake for my birthday. So nice! Stung realising a coffee chain gave more than my own parents or sister.
Mum and dad sent separate WhatsApp messages this morning wishing me happy birthday but no sign of the word “love” in either. First birthday without a card or present. Not that I feel entitled to anything and it always feels a bit forced anyway; it’s still a noticeable change this year. I think I know why but it would take too long to explain here. 


It’s been a long road towards no contact but after a breakthrough in EMDR therapy 2 weeks ago it’s basically the only option. I can’t unsee things now. I also need to protect my daughter (11 months old) from a future of the same cruel/kind flip-flopping and conditional love that’s shaped my entire life. 


Here’s to breaking the cycle of generational trauma! 🤞🏼


Any advice about how to preserve contact with some other family members would be appreciated. It’s my sister’s wedding early 2026 but after that I don’t see any need to keep the charade up with my parents. Sister was triangulated against me over the years too so not entirely going to miss her either if it comes to that.

I think this sub trends negative bc those are the folks who need the most support.  I have now been on buspirone for over 2 months so I'm ready to share my experience to help anyone who is nervous to see some positive stories. 

# Background

Before this, I had never taken an anti-anxiety medication before except for a benzo here and there for flying. No SSRIs or anything. I have no formal diagnosis but I believe I have GAD. I sought this medication out myself and asked my doctor for it. 

# Experience

I started with 7.5mg 2x a day and IMMEDIATELY felt so much better. I know there is debate about whether or not you can take this as needed, but I definitely felt like about 1 hour after taking it, I would feel super peaceful and calm. The first week or two was honestly perfect. I didn't have any side effects whatsoever and I felt noticeably calmer.

I usually take my first dose when I wake up around 8:30am and then again around 3pm. I've experimented with when I take that second dose or if I take 3 doses. It's usually the best for me to take 2 doses about \~8 hours apart, but if I'm having a bad day I may take my second dose earlier. I don't like taking a 3rd dose bc its too close to bedtime and that makes it hard for me to sleep. 

By week 3, I think the honeymoon effects were starting to wear off. It wasn't as dramatic as an effect. They say it works better over time, but I almost felt like I was getting a tolerance to it. So I talked to my doctor and increased my dose to 10mg 2x a day.  At this higher dose, I started feeling better again, but I also started experiencing side effects. I really only ever got them once or twice a week, so it hasn't been anything that made me want to stop. I usually just feel a little dizzy and out of it for an hour or so after taking the meds, but it wears off and then I feel great. Usually only happens if I take it without food, enough water, or if I take my doses too close together. 

I also feel that now that I've been on 10mg 2x a day for over 2 months, I rarely get a side effect. I feel like I might be upping my dose in another couple months, but this is working for me for now. 

# Negatives

Honestly, very few negatives! 

\- Occasional dizziness if not taken consistently/carefully

\- Occasional headaches towards the end of the day if not sufficiently hydrated

\- Its a little harder for me to sleep now. I try to take my dose before 5pm to not affect my sleep. I do tend to wake up anxious in the morning or before my alarm which is a bummer, but now that I'm managing my day-to-day anxiety, I'm able to start incorporating meditation which is starting to help with sleep and morning anxiety. I do feel like this medication helps me make the behavioral changes needed for wholistic anxiety treatment. 

# Positives

So many positives!! 

\- I just feel so much less anxious! I can tell It's working bc if I miss a dose, I feel like I did before and I remember how awful my anxiety was. 

\- I can handle my stressful job! I mostly started this med to get through some tough work stuff. I am trying to make a change but I don't have the luxury of just quitting, so I've had to be patient. This medication has helped me not be depressed or paralyzed with anxiety as I go through this difficult transition. 

\- I can drink coffee again! Coffee and too much caffeine used to wreck my system and I would spiral with anxiety. But now that I'm on this med, I can enjoy coffee again. I still don't drink it every day and don't drink very much bc I don't want to counter act the meds and get too anxious again, but this is a real treat

\- I am a people pleaser and this has helped me so much with setting boundaries! I'm also like a much better arguer? I just feel so much more able to respond in the moment without overwhelming anxiety. i'm less concerned with if people don't like me (not 100% though... I'm still me ) 

\- I went through the most intense work shake up of my life about 1 month into the meds, and I am shocked at how well I handled it. It def doesn't remove anxiety completely. I had really bad days of course. Its not like a benzo. But when I would wake up dreading going to work, about 30 min after taking my meds, I could just suddenly handle everything. Its a nice balancer. 

\- I really like having the doses when I wake up and right about when i get off of work bc I feel like it sets me up for a calm and collected work day and then resets me for a nice evening. Before, I would be so drained by the time work was over, that I would just veg all night, but now I feel like I can really reset and have a whole second half of my day. 

# Misc

Alcohol -- I know this isn't the most important thing, but I know people are thinking about it! I didn't drink any alcohol for the first month I was on it bc I wanted to be super smart and safe and know how this medicine affected me. I talked to my doctor who said not to drink at all but if I MUST (harm reduction!) that I should be 8 hours from my last dose. I'm starting to experiment with a couple of drinks here and there. Haven't done any binge drinking yet. 

  
Thats it I think! Happy to answer any questions if I missed something. I know this doesn't work for everyone. Some people don't feel anything and some people have debilitating side effects and that is all super valid. But this is my experience! I hope it helps someone be less anxious about at least giving it a try. ",1,1759333194.0,Buspirone,0,1.0,False

**Why This Pick?**

Casey Mize (3.87 ERA) has not been the Tigers’ most reliable starter this season. To boot, he’s carrying an ERA of 4.04 around on the road, and this will be his first stint in the post-season; I expect the Guardians to capitalize with both the home and pitching advantage (Tanner Bibee is better at home than his overall ERA suggests). Cleveland has won 4 of Bibee’s (4.24 ERA) last 5 starts, and 3 of those 4 wins have been by at least 2 runs. So what’s *Pick of the Day*? I’ll put my money on the Guardians to score at least 4 here.

1nvbljp,https://www.reddit.com/r/NicotineSupport/comments/1nvbljp/i_quit_smoking_cold_turkey_on_my_first_try_may/,I quit smoking cold turkey on my first try. May this post help one other person.,"I smoked for 15 plus years from 19 years old, and managed to quit cold turkey on the first try. The most important factor for me was my desire to quit. I WANTED to quit.

I had been smoking for far too long (more than 15 years), and I worried that I would bring disaster and grief to my family and loved ones. This worry built up over several years, and it was always gnawing at the back of my mind. 

Also, smoking no longer brought me pleasure. The high, the relaxation, the pleasure, they no longer came to me. Instead, my throat felt scratchy and dry, my stomach often felt queasy, and my eyes felt dry whenever I smoked. I decided that the time had come to quit. I had wasted so much money and time, so much health. This was it, I had to draw the line somewhere, and it had to be now.

I knew that it would be a drawn out, drag out fight against the chemical addiction, and that I would have to outlast the deep deep hooks of nicotine. I knew that I would be brought to the deepest darkest pits of desire and weakness. I was the one who wanted to smoke, and I was now the one who wanted to quit. And one side of me would have to win and the other side would have to loose. But it was all me. I was fighting to leave, but I was also fighting to stay. 

I decided that I would quit on the next vacation that me and my wife went on. I wanted the foreign surroundings to distract me, I wanted the change in routine to break my patterns, and I wanted the pomp and circumstance of the vacation to mark the decision. 

I smoked my last cigarette at the airport before boarding the flight to go on the vacation. I gave the remaining pack of cigs and my lighter to my wife, and I told her I was going to quit (she didn't know prior). I told her to throw the cigs away, and to hang on to me tighter than ever. She was delighted and surprised. Her eyes shone, her smile glowed, she had never looked more beautiful. I cherished the moment and I committed it to memory. THIS!!!! THIS IS WHAT I WAS GOING TO FIGHT FOR!!! She was so beautiful, she truly was.... 

I got on the flight, and when I got off the flight, I was itching for a smoke. I ignored it and pretended that I couldn't hear the internal whine and winge of addiction. We got on a cab to go to the resort. When we got off the cab, my hands were shaking for a smoke. My wife held my hand and felt the tremor, and she squeezed my hand and told me she would never let me go. My other hand squeezed the luggage handle as hard as I could and I vowed to never let go. I was completely addled and cross-eyed. 

I went through the check-in and collected the key, went to the hotel room, and I drank a gallon of water (not in a hurry, but I gave myself bloat). Over the next 2 hours, I peed and peed and watched TV and ran to the toilet. I needed to pee urgently, and that masked the craving for cigs. So I drank MORE!! and spent more than half the day power washing the toilet bowl. 

But here's the thing... I survived more than half the day, plus taxi time plus flight time plus airport time. NO SMOKING!!! This was the longest I ever went without without smoking!!! It's working!!! 

We went out for dinner, and I just spent all my time distracting myself. I tried to saw a beef bone in half with a butter knife. I tried to memorize the restaurant menu right then and there. I checked if all the restaurant chairs had the same embroidery. Stupid stuff. But it was important, I was keeping myself occupied and distracted, so that I would not decide to find a pack of cigs and a lighter. It worked, distraction worked.

Over the next day, I kept on distracting myself. I was on vacation in a foreign land, doing things that I would not normally do. It was easy to distract myself and keep my attention on new and shiny things all the time.

One day turned into two, turned into three, turned into four. My lungs itched for a smoke. I mean, literally, itched. I went to the hotel gym and held 5lb dumbbells while jogging on the thread mill. I was heaving and stumbling, but more importantly, it made my lungs burn. The itch went away, I didn't need a cig, I needed oxygen, I was turning blue between wheezes!! Damn, the burn felt good, because it erased the itch.

This was how I got by. My deep, deep cravings got shallower and more distant. My crazy behavior got less extreme. After a week, it was time to go home, no more vacation, but I was getting more confident by the day, at beating the itch and crave. I was sure that I would snort coffee powder if I had to, to make the itch go away.

A week turned into two weeks, turned into three weeks. A month turned into 2 months, turned into 3 months. Believe me, I suffered through it all. I felt every deep gouge of chemical craving. But here's the thing, it got easier and easier. The crave got lighter and lighter. My need for distraction got less and less. I could cruise for longer and longer stretches without needing to fight the call of addiction. 

A year turned into 2 years, turned into 3 years. I now had something to protect. I had suffered and hurt for 3 years of smoke-free existence. That was not easy, I paid a high price. This is worth defending. My first child was on the way. Life was fundamentally changing direction. I had larger things to live for, I OWED huge debts to the people around me, my beautiful wife, my unborn son, and my future self. This fight is worth fighting. I pledge myself to this new, better world. I will stay the course. I can and I will, because it gets easier. The urge fades, the old demons get weaker, I get stronger. 

I have been smoke free for more than 15 years now. My beautiful wife is MORE beautiful than ever, she is my future, she is my ALL. My son is more than 10 years old now. He is a better person than I ever was, a stronger and calmer character, and a deep well of innocence and purity. He will carry the best parts of me into a brave new future, a future that I cannot go to. 

And that is my humble form of immortality. Some day, I hope to have the privilege of looking in on my lineage, and recognizing fundamental parts of me in strangely familiar strangers. And knowing that all my effort and struggle in life was worth it. 

I loved my son from the moment he opened his eyes, and I will love him until I close my eyes. And if there is a way to love him in the afterlife, I will FIND IT!! And I will love him forever. May nothing stand in my way.",1,1759333092.0,NicotineSupport,0,1.0,False

1nvbjl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1nvbjl4/how_i_quit_smoking/,How I quit smoking.,"I smoked for 15 plus years from 19 years old, and managed to quit cold turkey on the first try. The most important factor for me was my desire to quit. I WANTED to quit.

I had been smoking for far too long (more than 15 years), and I worried that I would bring disaster and grief to my family and loved ones. This worry built up over several years, and it was always gnawing at the back of my mind. 

Also, smoking no longer brought me pleasure. The high, the relaxation, the pleasure, they no longer came to me. Instead, my throat felt scratchy and dry, my stomach often felt queasy, and my eyes felt dry whenever I smoked. I decided that the time had come to quit. I had wasted so much money and time, so much health. This was it, I had to draw the line somewhere, and it had to be now.

I knew that it would be a drawn out, drag out fight against the chemical addiction, and that I would have to outlast the deep deep hooks of nicotine. I knew that I would be brought to the deepest darkest pits of desire and weakness. I was the one who wanted to smoke, and I was now the one who wanted to quit. And one side of me would have to win and the other side would have to loose. But it was all me. I was fighting to leave, but I was also fighting to stay. 

I decided that I would quit on the next vacation that me and my wife went on. I wanted the foreign surroundings to distract me, I wanted the change in routine to break my patterns, and I wanted the pomp and circumstance of the vacation to mark the decision. 

I smoked my last cigarette at the airport before boarding the flight to go on the vacation. I gave the remaining pack of cigs and my lighter to my wife, and I told her I was going to quit (she didn't know prior). I told her to throw the cigs away, and to hang on to me tighter than ever. She was delighted and surprised. Her eyes shone, her smile glowed, she had never looked more beautiful. I cherished the moment and I committed it to memory. THIS!!!! THIS IS WHAT I WAS GOING TO FIGHT FOR!!! She was so beautiful, she truly was.... 

I got on the flight, and when I got off the flight, I was itching for a smoke. I ignored it and pretended that I couldn't hear the internal whine and winge of addiction. We got on a cab to go to the resort. When we got off the cab, my hands were shaking for a smoke. My wife held my hand and felt the tremor, and she squeezed my hand and told me she would never let me go. My other hand squeezed the luggage handle as hard as I could and I vowed to never let go. I was completely addled and cross-eyed. 

I went through the check-in and collected the key, went to the hotel room, and I drank a gallon of water (not in a hurry, but I gave myself bloat). Over the next 2 hours, I peed and peed and watched TV and ran to the toilet. I needed to pee urgently, and that masked the craving for cigs. So I drank MORE!! and spent more than half the day power washing the toilet bowl. 

But here's the thing... I survived more than half the day, plus taxi time plus flight time plus airport time. NO SMOKING!!! This was the longest I ever went without without smoking!!! It's working!!! 

We went out for dinner, and I just spent all my time distracting myself. I tried to saw a beef bone in half with a butter knife. I tried to memorize the restaurant menu right then and there. I checked if all the restaurant chairs had the same embroidery. Stupid stuff. But it was important, I was keeping myself occupied and distracted, so that I would not decide to find a pack of cigs and a lighter. It worked, distraction worked.

Over the next day, I kept on distracting myself. I was on vacation in a foreign land, doing things that I would not normally do. It was easy to distract myself and keep my attention on new and shiny things all the time.

One day turned into two, turned into three, turned into four. My lungs itched for a smoke. I mean, literally, itched. I went to the hotel gym and held 5lb dumbbells while jogging on the thread mill. I was heaving and stumbling, but more importantly, it made my lungs burn. The itch went away, I didn't need a cig, I needed oxygen, I was turning blue between wheezes!! Damn, the burn felt good, because it erased the itch.

This was how I got by. My deep, deep cravings got shallower and more distant. My crazy behavior got less extreme. After a week, it was time to go home, no more vacation, but I was getting more confident by the day, at beating the itch and crave. I was sure that I would snort coffee powder if I had to, to make the itch go away.

A week turned into two weeks, turned into three weeks. A month turned into 2 months, turned into 3 months. Believe me, I suffered through it all. I felt every deep gouge of chemical craving. But here's the thing, it got easier and easier. The crave got lighter and lighter. My need for distraction got less and less. I could cruise for longer and longer stretches without needing to fight the call of addiction. 

A year turned into 2 years, turned into 3 years. I now had something to protect. I had suffered and hurt for 3 years of smoke-free existence. That was not easy, I paid a high price. This is worth defending. My first child was on the way. Life was fundamentally changing direction. I had larger things to live for, I OWED huge debts to the people around me, my beautiful wife, my unborn son, and my future self. This fight is worth fighting. I pledge myself to this new, better world. I will stay the course. I can and I will, because it gets easier. The urge fades, the old demons get weaker, I get stronger. 

I have been smoke free for more than 15 years now. My beautiful wife is MORE beautiful than ever, she is my future, she is my ALL. My son is more than 10 years old now. He is a better person than I ever was, a stronger and calmer character, and a deep well of innocence and purity. He will carry the best parts of me into a brave new future, a future that I cannot go to. 

And that is my humble form of immortality. Some day, I hope to have the privilege of looking in on my lineage, and recognizing fundamental parts of me in strangely familiar strangers. And knowing that all my effort and struggle in life was worth it. 

I loved my son from the moment he opened his eyes, and I will love him until I close my eyes. And if there is a way to love him in the afterlife, I will FIND IT!! And I will love him forever. May nothing stand in my way.",5,1759332969.0,stopsmoking,2,1.0,False

1nvbgki,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1nvbgki/speaking_a_little_vietnamese_goes_a_long_way/,Speaking a little Vietnamese goes a long way,"I'm from Singapore. Since 2023, I travel to Vietnam once a year or so for holiday because I'm so fascinated by the culture. I make an effort to learn common Vietnamese phrases and practise my pronunciations in the local accent. I originally learned basic Vietnamese in giọng Hà Nội, which appears to be what Google translate and many online resources use. 

I just travelled to Saigon and Tây Ninh from 24-29th September, and I revised my giọng Sài Gòn before landing.

I try my best to speak Vietnamese, even though sometimes I embarrassingly use the wrong tones or mix my Hanoi vs Saigon pronunciations mid sentence (e.g. saying dừa with a [z] instead of a [y]). 🫤

People can obviously tell that I'm a người nước ngoài by my strange accent. That's what I overheard the cô selling cơm tấm lightly gossiping to a fellow cô when I ordered cơm sườn bì và ốp la mang về in my broken Vietnamese. Nevertheless she understood my order on first saying without me pointing, so I take that as win yay 😄... (later she also called me handsome 🫣) . 

In Tây Ninh, people were a lot friendlier and more welcoming when they heard me attempting to order or speak in Vietnamese. Some may be amused but nevertheless extra warm and helpful. Tây Ninh sellers are less likely to know any English than in big cities like Sài Gòn so a little Vietnamese goes a long way. When the food was good at a small eatery, saying ngon made the cô or chị smile a lot.  

Near my homestay in Tây Ninh, I always saw an elder auntie sitting at the motorbike parking area, and everytime I just say chào cô (flatter her with the cô instead of a bà). And she would smile widely and say something like chào em nha, and she recognised me quite quickly whenever I passed by. 

At the homestay itself, even though some of the staff knew some English, saying somethings in Vietnamese made them light up. So one of them offered me a custard apple as a check in gift, and I remembered seeing a lot of custard apples near Núi Bà Đen earlier, so I made a guess then that it is probably like the native fruit of the area. So I asked in choppy way, ""cái này là ... Tây Ninh đặc biệt không?"" And they were so happy, saying ""đúng rồi!!"". 

The homestay owners (chú and cô) treated me so well with freshly cut fruits, coconut smoothie, coffee, sweets and bánh tráng trộn throughout my short 2D1N stay. They also invited me to join them for a home cooked family lunch after I checked out, and they cooked several dishes including what looked like fried strips with brown crisps which turns out to be my favourite. After tasting, I asked ""cái này là gì? Ngon quá"" and cô said happily ""dậu hũ"". I cook regularly so I wanted to figure out the ingredients, and I said ""cái này có sả.... nước mắm.... ớt.... đường?"" and they seemed so ecstatic and added ""không đường.... tỏi.... tiêu..."".

One of the English-fluent staff then messaged me after I took the bus back to Sài Gòn, saying chú and cô liked me a lot, that I'm one of the best guests they have hosted. And that when I return next time, ""chú và cô sẽ làm đậu hũ chiên sả"" 😄

So long story short.... being a foreigner/traveller, learning Vietnamese (despite my limited vocabulary, broken grammar and weird accent) changed how I interact with people and opened up a whole new world of deep appreciation and interest of local customs and culture. 

Not sure why but Vietnamese people are extremely receptive to people learning their language (same can't necessarily be said for some other Asian countries), which encourages me to become even better in my conversational Vietnamese. ",15,1759332789.0,VietNam,5,0.94,False

The Reality Check:
I reached 178 lbs one month ago and truly felt awful about myself. All of my clothes no longer fit I was exhausted by 2 PM every day and I continued to begin diets that I would quit within days. Ring a bell? I'd attempted everything  calorie counting low carb  pricey meal prep companies that I never lasted more than a week with. 

Then I came across something new. 

What Changed Everything:
I came across this 21 day smoothie diet that revolves around nutrient packed recipes intended to naturally increase metabolism and suppress hunger. Every smoothie mixes particular fruits greens and proteins that really satisfy you rather than leave you hungry.


Why I Tried It:
Honestly I was skeptical as heck. But I thought even if it didn't do anything for weight loss at least I'd be getting more vitamins than my typical diet of coffee and whatever I managed to scrounge between meetings. 

The Results Caught Me Off Guard: 

Days 1-7: Lost 5 lbs and actually had energy in the afternoons 

Days 8-14: Junk food cravings nearly disappeared 

Days 15-21: Lost a total of 11 lbs sleeping better skin clearer 

The Surprising Side Benefits: 

No longer 3 PM energy crashes that left me grabbing for sugar 

Actually started craving the flavor of healthy food again 

My mood increased dramatically (fewer hangry moments) 

Felt like I wasn't constantly waging war with hunger 

The Truth:
It wasn't a magic bullet  I still had to make intentional decisions every day. There were certainly times when I craved pizza over a green smoothie. But with a defined uncomplicated system in place it was a lot easier to stay on track. 

What I Learned
The greatest victory wasn't even the weight loss  it was finally ending the cycle of starting and quitting diets. For the first time in years I had a sense of control over my eating.

**Flowers** \- £500, bridal bouqet, bridesmaids, 5 buttonholes and 2 corsages for MoB & MoG. We used Daisy Chain florists in Leeds and they nailed the brief. All the other flowers (venue and church) were done for free by my MiL floristy group.

It was never always like this. I am 44 and I have been running for more than 25 years, 30 years even as running was a part of our cross training. People were simple back then just show up at Ultra or around Greenhills Shopping Center and go about your run and eat breakfast after. Now there are a lot of runners who are running just for clout I think. It's great people are running and getting healthier but some people and run clubs are just so toxic. I always run around my neighborhood, back then we were probably just less than 20 people running around in the morning, nowadays I estimate there are about 120-150 people running, probably even more when this particular run club shows up. 

This club I believe has good coaches and I'm sure pretty good intentions but some of their members are just so toxic! They love running around in a horizontal formation and blocking the other runners from overtaking them, they love taking selfies while running - one time I was overtaking this guy then suddenly he took out a selfie stick and extended it and almost poked my face! granted he didn't see me but who takes selfie sticks to runs? Sometimes while they're running they'd be shouting like soldiers marching, I mean hello, you are running by some condos, maybe don't shout and not be a nuisance? Sometimes they also block the pedestrian lane so then can keep on framing shots for both photos and videos with SLRs then once they get the shots they wanted they'll leave and go get coffee - I mean really? Here they hog the area and they just chit chat and don't really run, sure some do but I think most just go to socialize. Some come in full on make up! at 530am? We're going to sweat and run.

  
I go overseas a lot for work and I always try to get a run in, I never see this kind of behavior elsewhere, I feel like it's uniquely Filipino! People there just show up and run then go about their business. I'm sure these guys are nice guys and they haven't done anything to me really but I just feel our culture is so toxic.

Putting this out there because the older you get, the smaller your social circle seems to shrink! I'm a 35 year old guy in Dublin (but happy to connect with people elsewhere in Ireland or further too) and I'm on the lookout for some great, new mates.
Just to be absolutely crystal clear I am happily engaged and have three brilliant, chaotic daughters, so I am strictly and exclusively looking for platonic friendships, a pint, a chat, maybe a shared love of obscure historical facts, you get the drill.
A Bit About Me:
 * The History Buff: If it happened before 1950, I've probably read a book on it (and will happily talk your ear off about the Vikings or the Irish War of Independence, depending on my mood). I love visiting historical sites, museums, and just exploring the layers of history in Dublin itself.
 * The Art Enthusiast: I'm no painter, but I love to draw mainly animation and getting out to galleries. I find modern art fascinating, and I think I've figured out what half the stuff in the Hugh Lane Gallery means (the other half is still a mystery, and that's okay!). It'd be great to have someone to bounce ideas off of while staring at a canvas.
 * The Dad: My weekdays are a blur of school runs and bedtime stories, but when I get some free time, I like to make the most of it.
 * The Fun Part: I'm generally pretty relaxed, have a dry sense of humour (feel free to dm me with your darkest or funniest dad jokes) and I'm a fantastic listener! I'm game for a quiet pint, a long coffee, a walk through a park, or even an overly dramatic debate about which era of history was the best.
What I'm Looking For:
Someone who is down to earth, easy to chat with, and also keen to broaden their friend group. Whether you're interested in the same things or want to introduce me to a new hobby, hit me up!
If you're a decent human, have a pulse, and are looking for a genuine, non-creepy, strictly platonic friend, send me a DM or drop a comment!
Cheers! 🍻

Whether you're binge-watching the latest thrillers or catching every live sports moment, the right subscription can transform your downtime into pure bliss. And right at the forefront of this streaming revolution stands [IlIPTV](https://IlIPTV.com), delivering crystal-clear channels from around the globe without the hassle of cables or contracts.

# Why October 2025 is Prime Time for IPTV Subscriptions 🌟

October has always been a sweet spot for savvy shoppers, and this year is no exception. With holidays like Halloween creeping up and football seasons heating up, demand for reliable, high-quality streaming is through the roof. IPTV subscriptions shine here because they offer flexibility like no other service out there. Imagine accessing thousands of live TV channels, on-demand movies, and exclusive series all in stunning 4K resolution, right from your smart TV or mobile device.

What sets this month apart? Providers are rolling out aggressive promotions to hook new viewers before the winter rush. We're talking slashed prices on annual plans, bundled extras like premium sports packages, and even zero-commitment trials to let you test the waters. If you've been on the fence about ditching traditional cable, now's your moment. These deals aren't just savings; they're a gateway to endless entertainment tailored to your lifestyle, whether you're a family movie night enthusiast or a die-hard sports fan.

# Top IPTV Subscription Deals to Snag Before They Vanish 💥

Let's dive straight into the goldmine of offers lighting up October 2025. First up, the monthly steal: for just a fraction of what you'd pay for basic cable, you can score unlimited access to over 20,000 channels worldwide. That's everything from international news feeds to niche documentaries, all buffered-free and ad-light. Pair it with a seasonal promo, and you're looking at up to 50% off your first three months. Perfect for dipping your toes in without long-term ties.

For those ready to commit, the three-month bundle is a game-changer. Clocking in at an unbeatable rate, it throws in perks like multi-device streaming—stream on your phone during commutes and switch seamlessly to the big screen at home. And don't sleep on the annual powerhouse deal: lock in a full year for the price of eight months, complete with automatic updates to the latest content libraries. Sports lovers, rejoice—many plans now include anti-freeze tech to ensure you never miss a goal, even during peak viewing hours.

These aren't pie-in-the-sky promises; they're backed by robust servers that handle peak traffic like a champ. Plus, with compatibility across Firestick, Roku, Android boxes, and more, setup feels effortless. One quick app download, and you're golden. October's limited-time flash sales mean these prices could evaporate by month's end, so marking your calendar isn't just smart—it's essential.

# The Hidden Gems: Features That Elevate Your Viewing Experience ✨

Beyond the bargain prices, what really makes these IPTV subscriptions pop in 2025 are the thoughtful touches that enhance every session. Picture this: electronic program guides (EPGs) that are intuitive and searchable, letting you plan your watchlist days in advance. Or catch-up TV functionality, where you rewind live broadcasts up to 7 days back—ideal for those ""I blinked and missed the plot twist"" moments.

Quality is king, too. Expect VOD libraries stocked with fresh releases, from Hollywood blockbusters to indie hidden treasures, all in multiple languages with subtitles on demand. Families will love the kid-friendly filters, while cord-cutters appreciate the absence of blackouts on major networks. And for the tech-curious, built-in VPN support keeps your streams private and speedy, no extra gadgets required.

One standout perk across these deals? A free 1-day trial that lets you explore the full suite risk-free. Fire it up, flip through channels, and see if it vibes with your setup before dropping a dime. It's like a backstage pass to the best show in town, minus the velvet rope.

# How to Jump In and Maximize Your October Savings 🛡️

Getting started is simpler than brewing your morning coffee. Head to a trusted signup page, pick your plan, and enter your details—secure payment options abound, from cards to crypto for that extra layer of anonymity. Activation emails zip to your inbox in minutes, and boom: instant access. Pro tip: during setup, tweak your playlist preferences to prioritize your faves, like UK Premier League matches or Bollywood extravaganzas.

To stretch those savings further, stack your subscription with a compatible device upgrade if needed—October's gadget sales are syncing up nicely. Keep an eye on email newsletters for bonus codes; many drop mid-month exclusives that shave off even more. And if tech hiccups arise? Round-the-clock support chats are there to smooth things over, often resolving issues in under five minutes.

In a world where streaming wars rage on, these IPTV subscription deals for October 2025 cut through the noise with value you can feel. They're not just about watching TV; they're about reclaiming control over your entertainment destiny. Ready to level up? Swing by [IlIPTV.com](https://IlIPTV.com) today and claim that free 1-day trial—your next obsession awaits just a click away.

Anyway, I’m planning a meetup for a handful of millennial Jewish folks in my city. It’s on a Sunday evening in a city with very few third-spaces open on Sunday nights. Especially those centrally located. So I picked a local coffee shop. No problem when the location was announced (date and time were previously voted on by the group). It’s also the same location we met previously. Turns out the coffee shop owner supports Palestinians (what precisely that means and to what extent is unknown to me) and now two vocal people in the group have made it publicly known they will not attend at such a location.

Here is the deal - 1) I’m very busy and have zero interest in investigating the political leanings of a second rate coffee shop owner. 2) Even if I disagree with the owner politically, I’m there to use the space, not to endorse anything. 3) As public support for Israel dramatically decreases in the US, I don’t think it’s helpful for Jews to start isolating themselves to an increasingly small number of “approved” locations. And most importantly, 4) I simply do not care. The meetup has nothing to do with politics.

Now I definitely support Israel but that’s irrelevant to me in this context. I’ve even gone to an explicitly “non-Zionist shabbos dinner” because I respect the right of others to have a difference of opinion but still be good company.

What upsets me is this increasing litmus test that everything has to be political. It’s exhausting. And if we really want to play that game, I’m sure I can find something morally objectionable about most business owners, including Israeli owned businesses. And what also upsets me is this is dividing the Jewish community.

I want to just cancel the event entirely. It’s not easy being gay and Jewish.

Just wanted to expand on my thread title a bit. I got an AT-LP60X turntable for my birthday and it feels like a switch has been flipped. I've always dreamed of having a dedicated listening space at home to just chill and enjoy music, and that dream is finally starting to take shape.   
My setup is as budget as it gets right now, but I genuinely love the ritual of spinning a record, grabbing a coffee, and reading.

Now, I'm looking to plan my upgrade path. I'm not in a hurry (and my wallet isn't exactly deep xd). I've done some reading and the Fluance RT82 seems to get a lot of love, but I'm open to any and all suggestions.

On the amp side, I've pretty much decided on the Yamaha A-S301. It's kind of a legendary piece of gear here in Argentina, and they're easy to find. For speakers, though, I'm drawing a blank, so I'd love to hear your recommendations.

Any advice you can offer would be awesome. Thanks!",1,1759331596.0,turntables,1,1.0,False

1nvarnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/1nvarnm/1_week_since_i_last_saw_my_best_friend/,1 Week Since I Last Saw My Best Friend,"Our 4 year old dog, our best friend, died suddenly a week ago from an arrhythmia. It has been the hardest week of my life. The grief has less of a choke hold on me than it did the first couple of days, I feel my nervous system settling. I am starting to sleep, eat and breathe again. Wanted to check in. 

Things that have been the hardest:

- Blaming myself - was that last hike we did, almost two weeks before he died, too big? When I thought he just had the hiccups a week and a half before, was it something more? If I had taken him to the vet, could he still be here? He seemed like his normal self. I’m told there are no signs and this is just a freak thing but I can’t stop looking for answers. 

-Waking up without him curled up next to me.

-Having my morning coffee on the couch, chilling in the evening without him curled up next to me.

-Coming home and not hearing his loud, emotional welcome, howl.

-Cleaning - I have done what I could but couldn’t bring myself to vacuum, wash our bedding, or wipe his nose prints from our windows.

-Just being at home - constant reminders.

What has helped:

-Knowing that guilt is a very common feeling after a pet dies - we are 100% responsible for them in life, of course we feel 100% responsible for their death. 

-Focusing on all the ways we gave him a life of love, comfort, adventure.

- Posting here and making connections with others going through the same thing.

-Audiobook: Repairing the Heartbreak of Pet Loss Grief by C. Jeffrey (recommend listening, very compassionate voice)

-How our community has shown up, sending flowers, bringing food, checking in, listening. Talking about it a lot.

-Recording all my favorite memories of him as they come up, lessons he taught me. Journaling about it.

-Lots of cuddling and talking with my husband, who is equally grief stricken.

-Making a memory box of his things and lighting a candle next to it.

-Talking to him, telling him how much I love and miss him, am grateful for the time we had together, that I am sorry if I missed something and I would have done anything to keep him here.

-Sleeping with his favorite stuffed animal, taking his leash on walks with us.

-Looking for signs from him - waking up with the perfect song in my head, a moth lands nearby that is his same color, fuzzy. Seeing a white dog sleeping peacefully in a doorway while I’m very emotional. Someone calls me to check in at exactly the moment I begin to spiral. 

-Getting out of the house when I can, seeing friends.

-Beginning to rewatch my favorite funny shows.

Hang in there, y’all. Reach out if you’d like to. Much love. ❤️

1nvar1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nvar1m/aita_for_not_wanting_my_wife_to_go_for_coffee/,AITA for not wanting my wife to go for coffee 1-on-1 with guys from her running group,"Longtime lurker, set up an account to make this post, my first.  38M married 10 years to wife ""Sue"" (38F).  Moved across the country a couple years ago for better work opportunities for both of us; however, this has taken us away from family and longtime friends, and as we're both somewhat introverted it's been hard on us socially.  I'll also mention that I have always been a bit on the jealous side and so my wife having strong friendships with men is something I don't especially love, although recognizing this tendency in myself, I try very hard not to have unreasonable boundaries.  

Sue decided about a year ago to start running again (she used to do cross-country in HS and college; she has always been reasonably fit but wants to get back into top shape).  I am also reasonably fit but I don't like running for running's sake -- I prefer playing a game (tennis, basketball) and she doesn't like competing in those kind of sports.  She started running by herself before work every morning, and on weekdays she still does that, but she found a small running club that meets nearby on Saturday and Sunday mornings, and she's been going for about 6 months. 

The club has 8 ""regulars"" including my wife, and a few infrequent visitors.  4 of the other regulars are women and 3 are men.  I've never met any of them except one of the women whom Sue introduced to me as she runs a booth at a farmer's market we sometimes go to; however, Sue has shared a few things about all of them and so I sort of ""know"" the group vicariously.  On an average weekend day, maybe 4-5 of them show up, but sometimes it can be more or less... sometimes it's just my wife and she runs solo; sometimes it's just two.  And the other thing is, whoever shows up, if they have time, they'll often go to a local coffeeshop afterward.  If Sue runs and comes straight home, she's usually home around 9 am; if she goes for coffee, it's more like 10.  (For what it's worth, my wife would never go to this coffeeshop by herself; she'd just make it at home.  If she goes for coffee it's for the socialization, not the coffee.)   

So last Sunday Sue gets home at 10 and so I assume this was one of the times she went for coffee.  I ask her how running was and she says, ""Great!  It was so beautiful this morning.""  I ask her who showed up and she says, ""Oh, it was just Dylan today.""  And I said, ""Oh, well you got home late..."" and she says, ""Yeah, we went to \[coffeeshop name\] after.""  Me: ""Just you and Dylan?""  Her: ""Yeah, of course, like I said he was the only one who came today.""  And now my wife sees the ""look"" on my face and says, ""Is that a problem?""

And I got all flustered about my feelings and babbled for a bit, but basically tried to say, ""Well, that does make me uncomfortable"" and when she kept pressing for why, I said, ""Look, if it's a group of you going for coffee, no problem.  If it's you and just one of the other women, no problem.  But when it's you one-on-one with one of the men, that feels ... like, you know, a date.""  She blew up at me... ""A date?  That's ridiculous.  It's just coffee with a friend.""  And I said, ""Yeah, but 'going for coffee' is considered the standard 'first date' for a reason.""  She asked if I had a problem with her running with just Dylan and I said no (which, TBH, I don't really like this either, but I also don't think it would be reasonable to tell her after showing up to run that she can't go because it's with a guy, so this is where, like I said, I'm trying not to have unreasonable boundaries so I'm trying to suck it up here), and then asked if I'm OK with her running with him, what's the problem with having coffee with him?  And I said ""this isn't about Dylan specifically, it's about the idea of you having coffee 1-on-1 with a guy.  The running is different because you're running, and probably having minimal conversation.  The whole idea of going for coffee with someone is to talk to them.  Like I said, there's a reason why it's the most common first date.""  She still didn't get my point, so I said, ""Let me put it this way... if Dylan said after your run, ""Hey, I have to take my mom somewhere so I can't go for coffee right now... but I could meet you for lunch at noon if you wanted,"" what would you say?  And she said, ""Well, that's different... I wouldn't go to lunch with him... at least not without asking you if you wanted to come too.""  Me: ""Because it would be like a date?""  Her: ""Yeah, I guess so.""  Me: ""So you can see why I don't like you going for coffee with a guy?""  Her: ""Well, I wouldn't go on a coffee ""date"" with a guy, but this is different, because it's just our normal after-the-run coffee.  Whoever runs that day is invited; it just happens that in this case, it was just me and Dylan.""         

So I've been reflecting on that and trying to figure out if I'm the asshole for feeling the way I do, or if it's reasonable for me to not want my wife to go for coffee with Dylan (or other guys from the group) one-on-one if they're the only ones going.",0,1759331223.0,AITAH,30,0.44,False
1nvapl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1nvapl7/i_dont_know_what_im_feeling/,I don't know what I'm feeling,"Hey guys, 23F fere. I've been dating a girl for a few months and I am really attracted to her, she is nice and the good thing is we are always together since we are on the same campus. 

Last month, we had a huge fight about jealousy. I was the one who was jealous, usually I am not a jealous type but she seemed to care about her friends more than me, and she ditched me a couple of times for them. Sometimes I feel like she doesn't care about this relationship even though we are mostly together, sleeping and posting stuff together etc.

  
Anyways, after this fight we worked things out, since I like and she likes me too. But one night when I was sleeping with her my mind clicked. I don't know how to explain this but I suddenly caught myself thinking about and missing the girl I was casually flirting and hanging out with. We were more like friends than girlfriends. She seemed to be interested in me but I was not. Maybe I was, I really don't know at this point.

She was the sweetest person I've ever met, hands down. An angel on earth, supported me in many ways from mentally to financially. We lived away from each other, she was in another college and was living with her family. But she made sure we hang out every 2 days or so. I really loved her existence. She was hands down the ""ideal girl"". But I didn't have those feelings for her back then. Maybe I was looking for something more exciting since she had this very peaceful energy that didn't spark anything for me. 

  
After I met my girlfriend she asked me for coffee and explained that she likes me and now that I have a relationship she didn't want to be involved anymore. She thanked me for the times we had even though it was one sided and just left the table. We didn't have a closure. It was a peaceful goodbye once again, expected from her. 

  
The worst part is when you start comparing people to each other you just can't stop. I like my girlfriend, why am I comparing her to this person that I don't talk to anymore? Here are some notes I wrote (x is my gf and y is her)

\- X has a lot of friends and seems to care about them more than me. Y had friends too but she always managed to make time for both sides. 

\- X doesn't care about how I feel. When I am sad she just kisses me and hugs me and says that I will be okay. It sounds nice but feels like a duty she has to do. Y tried to talk to me all the time. Asked about how I feel, even though we were not together she always checked up on me. I once yelled at her for asking too many questions about my feelings but she was calm and supportive anyways. I felt guilty under her care.

\- X has a little hobbies. She doesn't busy herself with anything except her friends and when I do she seems bored. Y had many hobbies and interests, it was nice talking about them with her.

\- I have physical attraction to X , but not to Y.

\- Y is prettier, and I hate to say this but better. X feels like a normal person I ended up having feelings.

  
I feel disgusting. I even texted Y and tried to talk to her. She was uninterested having a conversation with me which hurts my feelings. I love talking to her, and no one understands me like her. I told her I miss our conversations and being her friend but she seemed... distant. I understand her. 

  
I just don't understand how come I can't feel anything romantic towards someone I think is better than my girlfriend. Please tell me what you think without mercy, you can ask further questions too. I want to resolve this. Thank you for reading.",1,1759331131.0,LesbianActually,1,1.0,False

I had a harrowing experience and a horrible month because of this seller on Carousell (username: pesschap), or alias Daniel Emmanuel LY. I would like to preface that I did take on risk with upfront payment, and only did so because (1) I was overseas, (2) fell sick and was unable to meet up, and (3) deep down, I want to believe in the good in people in honouring their word. It is not a super high or low amount and it is very lame to try to scam people for a children's trading card, to be perfectly honest.

1. I offered the seller on 11 September for the slab and made payment on the day at the seller's request, and promise that it will be mailed out within the week. (promise 1)
2. 14 September, 3 days later, my message for an update was ignored once. It was later responded to with the excuse that he was overseas (excuse 1, delay 1).
3. On 15 September, I asked him when he is back. He responded 1 day later on 15 September that he is back on Sunday, 21 September (delay 2).
4. I requested that he mail out by Monday, 22 September. This message was ignored (delay 3).
5. On 22 September, he replied that he is only free on Wednesday, 24 September or alternatively to meet up but I was unable to meet up (delay 4).
6. Seller then promised to mail the slab out on Wednesday. (promise 2)
7. On 25 September (midnight), I asked for an update. Seller gave an excuse that he just got home from work. (excuse 2). He then pretended to offer to meet up the next day. When asked where and what time, my messages were ignored (delay 5).
8. On 26 September, I asked for meet up and this was met with an offer to mail the slab out the next day. (promise 3, delay 6).
9. On 28 September, I asked if the slab was mailed out already. This was ignored (delay 7).
10. On 29 September, Monday, he asked to meet at his poc the next day to which I agreed (delay 8).
11. On 30 September, Tuesday, he informed last-minute that he cannot meet at his poc. He again pretended to offer to deliver the slab to my office the next day (delay 9).
12. Despite me giving him the time and place to deliver, he again did not show up (delay 10). He tried to delay further by offering to arrange lalamove to my home or workplace. I gave him until 6pm to provide proof of lalamove or refund. He eventually refunded.
13. I see that he has relisted the slab at +$70 the price he initially listed it as. I infer that he either has seller's remorse, or is continuing to use the listing to take out a ""free loan"" from people, or to outrightly scam people - including with his other listings.

I initially had intentions to report him to the police, as well as to take out a civil action against him to recover my money. Since I managed to recover my money, I am just posting this as a PSA to hobbyists out there in case they come across his listings.

Moving forward, I will not be taking such risks with sellers (despite his many decent reviews on his profile, which I checked beforehand). But noticeably, this hobby has become way more sketchy and dubious as of late which is extremely disappointing.

I've been a barista for over 8 years, and I totally get how overwhelming it can be to choose the perfect espresso machine. After helping countless customers and friends find their ideal machine, I thought I'd share what I've learned.

First things first - you need to figure out what type of coffee drinker you are. Are you the ""I need my quick morning fix"" person, or do you enjoy the whole ritual of crafting the perfect shot? This makes a huge difference in which machine will work best for you.

For beginners, I always recommend starting with a semi-automatic machine. They're user-friendly but still give you enough control to learn the basics. I recently helped my sister pick one from https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine, and she's loving how easy it is to use while still making great coffee.

Here's what you should consider:

1. Budget: Good machines range from $200 to over $1000. Don't feel pressured to go high-end right away.

2. Size: Counter space matters! Measure your space before falling in love with a machine.

3. Features: Do you want a built-in grinder? Steam wand? Programmable settings?

4. Maintenance: Some machines need more cleaning and care than others.

From my experience, most people don't need all the fancy features that come with expensive machines. I've seen folks make amazing espresso with mid-range options that have the basics down pat.

One thing that often gets overlooked is the grinder. Even the best espresso machine won't make great coffee with poorly ground beans. If you're serious about espresso, consider getting a good burr grinder along with your machine.

I've found some really good deals at https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine - they have a great selection for different skill levels and budgets.

Tips from my years behind the bar:
- Start with a machine that's slightly above your current skill level
- Look for something with a good warranty
- Read reviews from actual users
- Consider the long-term maintenance costs
- Don't forget about accessories (tamper, milk pitcher, etc.)

The most important thing is to be honest about how you'll use the machine. There's no point in buying a complex manual machine if you're usually rushing in the morning!

Remember, the perfect espresso machine is the one that fits YOUR lifestyle and needs. Don't get caught up in what others say you ""should"" buy. Start with something that matches your current skills and budget, and you can always upgrade later as your coffee journey evolves.

Hope this helps! Feel free to ask any questions - I love geeking out about coffee gear!",1,1759330682.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1nvaew8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/1nvaew8/why_make_superman2025_year_three_instead_of_year/,Why make Superman(2025) “Year Three” instead of “Year One”?,"Somewhere along the line, I wonder if James Gunn decided to change things midway. Perhaps if nothing else so he could do that opening title screen, which he has said he added after Test Screening audiences had negative opinions on how confusing the movie was without context.

But he’s also said he didn’t really have a reason for writing everything in threes other than it sounding cool (and admittedly, it’s kinda cool as it’s memorable).

However, the worldbuilding of having Superman existing as a superhero publicly for three years opens up a lot of problems, unfortunately.

Because there’s a lot of things in the movie that establishes he’s dealing with for the first time - something which you’d expect from a “Year One” Superman, but not from a Year Three.

For instance, his interview with Lois is seemingly his first “tough” interview he’s ever had since he comes in completely and utterly unprepared to be asked hard hitting questions, which is why he flies off the handle and gets very upset at her questions, which are asked in an objective way. Yet he’s been Superman for three years now, so you’d think he’d have gotten interviewed by someone other than Clark Kent at some point.

Which also brings us to his Clark Kent persona.
In the movie, it’s established that his Hammer of Boravia story is his first front pager as Jimmy and him celebrate like bros and Ma Kent calls in to congratulate him for it. Yet if that were the case, then there’s no way Clark could have been the sole solo interviewer whom Superman chooses to speak to (something which is known publicly enough that Lex says “that reporter you always give interviews to”) without ever getting a front pager.

In the the Post Crisis comics, that’s literally how he lands his Daily Planet job after all - his very first story for the Planet is an exclusive interview with himself and that scoops Lois, who had been spending weeks trying to nail a one on one interview with Superman. And it is an instant front pager.
So how has Clark, who seemingly has had exclusives with Superman for the duration of three years, never gotten a front pager for the Daily Planet before now? He should literally be one it’s star reporters, second only to Lois Lane.

Then we come to Lex Luthor, who has had a three-year angry grudge against Superman’s very existence. He hates him so much that he used his limitless resources to not only clone his DNA and build a powerful being that’s his equal, but also to study his every battle to learn his move set and develop thousands of counters and attacks so he can combat him directly.

Yet despite his burning hatred for Superman, the movie establishes that not once did Superman and Lex Luthor ever meet face to face (“Superman. We finally meet. Would you like a coffee?” - Lex when Superman breaks into his office). Which is odd, considering how much Lex has dedicated his life to getting rid of him and that it took three years for him to come up with a plan to attack him directly. 

In most iterations of Superman, from the comics, to the shows, to the movies, and the cartoons, Superman and Lex can’t avoid each other and meet face to face within a few weeks or months of his debut. Sometimes even the first day. And Lex doesn’t immediately hate him until after Superman gives him a reason to (In Birthright for example, Lex is humiliated when Superman looks down upon him in public).

Then there’s the government - they seemingly don’t want to bring Superman in for questioning immediately after his actions in Jarhanpur  caused a rift between the United States and their longtime allying with Boravia. It takes Lex Luthor digging up the message from Superman’s birth parents for them to want to even talk to him.
The movie doesn’t really establish what Superman’s relationship is with the government or how they tolerate his existence and his willingness to act unilaterally, despite seemingly making his prime base in Metropolis - an American city.

You’d think that, if it had been three years since Superman first appeared on the scene, they’d have had some history with him and that Superman, being as open and friendly as he is, would have been willing to sit down with them on a few occasions to answer some tough questions. Especially since this is a world in which meta humans have existed for over 300 years.

But instead, because Superman is “popular”, they don’t even have anything to say about his unilateral actions and how that led to a seemingly rogue terrorist from Boravia (since Ghurkos publicly denied affiliation with the Hammer) coming on to US soil and causing millions of dollars in property damage and injuring several Metropolitans in a public battle with Superman. That would definitely be grounds to not only search fervently for the Hammer (something which, by the way, never comes up again and it’s not even verbalized that Superman makes the connection that the Hammer and Ultraman are the same person), but also bring Superman in for questioning that his actions led to a meta human terrorist attack from a foreign nation.

And then there’s Lois herself, who has known Clark’s secret for three months. And it was only now that she began to question him on tough issues to the point where it led to such an outburst that they nearly broke up. And she recognizes Superman, despite his inherent goodness, does have immaturity issues as he trusts too many people and is bothered by social media posts that mock him.
And again, this is for a three year-careered Superman.

Then there’s Kara and Krypto - both have seemingly not been on Earth long enough to have made much of a public splash. In fact it’s not even established if anyone knows Kara exists because Lex never even mentions her in his rant on his hatred of kryptonians (you’d think that, if this is the first time he and Superman meet, he’d have something to say about Kara, too, since she’s yet another alien on Earth).
And then Krypto is clearly not public knowledge as Lex is able to get away with being accused of taking Krypto and newscasters say his accusations are in Superman’s head. And then Lois, who had been dating Superman for months, asks “you have a dog?” 
(And then Peacemaker Season 2 kinda complicates matters by showing Supergirl in silhouette along with Superman and the Justice Gang showing up too late to help out with Season 1’s conflict, so that establishes she’s come out as a superhero in public).

So I just have to wonder if somewhere down the line, this movie was changed in the scriptwriting phase from a “Year One” story to a “Year Three”. Because all these aspects add up to making more sense for a Superman that’s still a bit green around the gills as opposed to a veteran Superman (and three years is normally when Superman is treated as a “veteran” - in three years in the post crisis comics, he had battled Darkseid, Mxyzptlk, Mongul, Metallo, Brainiac, Parasite, Toyman, Zod, etc.).

And it wouldn’t even require anything drastic. Just have a few lines relooped in ADR and change the opening crawl. And bam. It’s a year one Superman story.",0,1759330480.0,DC_Cinematic,24,0.19,False

hi! i’m 24 and permanently in my grandma era, the kind of person who wanders into a fabric store “just to look” on a sunday and leaves with three yards of something questionable but somehow perfect. if that sounds like your vibe, we should probably be friends.

i’m obsessed with quilting, sewing, and the very serious pastime of staring at my fabric stash like it’s going to sew itself. i love sharing wips, swapping pattern recs, and celebrating both gorgeous finishes and gloriously messy makes. seam allowance is a suggestion, right? 😅

thrifting is my go-to “idk what to do” activity especially when it means finding bedsheets and weird floral sets that would absolutely slay as a dress. if you’re into “catch and let go” thrifting or homesense hauls, i’m your girl.

age doesn’t matter (as long as you’re 22+). you don’t even have to craft, if you just like hearing about it, you’ll fit right in. cozy vibes, fabric rants, legal takes, funny cases and general chaos are universal.

i’m busy (law school + full-time work), but i love texting through the day, sharing random craft wins, little rants, memes, or whatever weird thing happened that morning. yapping is my love language… just not when it’s only “wyd.” be real, be funny, share a pic of your latest meal, adventure, or pet!

other things i love: stardew valley (currently on a perfectionist run), horror movies, cop shows (basically the same genre if you ask me), and weird playlists that jump from t-pain to icp in five minutes. i’m also political and lean left, so i like to put that out there upfront.

bonus: i love to craft, so if you’re also the type who’d come over to craft while watching TV, that’s a huge plus. i’m also always down for movies, coffee dates, and matcha dates (platonic vibes) ☕🍵. and yes, i will absolutely peer pressure you into finally finishing that one thing you’ve been putting off forever! Clubbing and parties aren’t my thing.

I’m also married so not looking for anything besides platonic friends.

The drought had stripped the life from everything, leaving the farm an expanse of powdered loam and dead corn husks. Thomas, the farmer, felt the failure in his bones—a deep, corrosive emptiness.

He found it three miles from the field, leaning against the fence line near the road. The old scarecrow, which they called Old Man Chafe, never moved. It was supposed to be nailed to a cross in the north forty. But here it was, standing upright, its patched denim coat heavy and wet, though there had been no rain.
Thomas hauled it back in the pickup. It felt wrong—too solid, too dense. It smelled strongly of dry, crushed chaff and something metallic, like old blood left on hot tin.
He jammed the cross stake deep into the mud of the north forty again. That night, he couldn't sleep. The field was silent, but he heard the soft, endless rustle of straw being repositioned beneath his window.

He went out before dawn. The scarecrow was gone.

He found it next to the porch, leaning against his boots. This time, it wasn't wearing its patched coat. It was draped in Thomas's own oilskin barn jacket, the one Thomas had left hanging on the back door handle.

His wife, Sarah, thought it was a prank played by their neighbor’s kids, but Thomas saw the difference. The sackcloth head, usually slack, was pulled tight, and the painted eyes—two black, unblinking circles—seemed to possess a depth they hadn’t before.

“It’s heavy,” Thomas said, dragging it away. 

“Like it’s been soaking up the earth.”

The slow invasion began.

The next day, Old Man Chafe was standing in the middle of their yard, its straw hands tied around Thomas’s own hickory walking stick. The day after, it was gone, but when Thomas looked in his mirror, he noticed the scarecrow’s unblinking, staring posture reflected in his own shoulders.

Thomas stopped sleeping. He watched the cornfield from his porch, drinking bitter coffee. The scarecrow was always there, leaning, watching. And then, it wasn't.

He found it standing in the kitchen doorway, its body now filling out the shoulders of his favorite, threadbare flannel shirt.

“Get out!” Thomas roared, grabbing a rusty pitchfork.

The scarecrow did not move. Its head tilted, and a dry, rasping sound—like a thousand insect wings beating against a leather drum—came from its stitched mouth.

“Tired, Thomas?” the voice whispered. The sound was horribly familiar—Thomas’s own timbre, but devoid of all humidity, all humanity. “The farm is heavy. The failures are many.”
The fear froze Thomas to the floor. The scarecrow’s eyes, the twin black circles, were studying him.

“I am the keeper,” the scarecrow rasped. “I keep things away. But you are hollow now. I feel the space.”

The air in the kitchen grew cold, smelling intensely of sun-bleached cotton and old decay.

The scarecrow pushed off the doorframe. As it moved, its denim trousers slid slightly, and Thomas saw it: the legs were no longer wood and straw. They were faintly vascular, pale and sickly white, like mushrooms grown in darkness.

“You’re finished,” the thing said, its voice now wet, gaining moisture. “Let me be your rest.”
Thomas swung the pitchfork. The tines passed through the scarecrow’s chest, making a horrible shredding sound of dry fiber and snapping bone.

But the scarecrow didn't bleed. Instead, a massive plume of dry, choking corn chaff exploded from the wound, blinding Thomas. The air filled with the dry, dusty smell of death.
Thomas stumbled back, clutching his eyes. When he could see, the scarecrow was standing inches away, its form subtly taller, wider, more defined. The straw filling was gone; the flannel shirt was now filled with taut, dry muscle that strained the stitching.
The scarecrow reached out a hand. It was no longer a bundled glove; it was long, thin, and pale, with nails like yellowed bone.

As the pale fingers brushed Thomas’s forearm, the exchange began.

Thomas felt a dizzying sense of relief. The weight of the farm, the shame of his debt, the grief over the drought—it all vanished in a blissful, overwhelming wave. He sighed, a deep, contented breath he hadn't taken in years.

Then the true horror hit. The relief was extraction.

His skin instantly felt cold, dry, and brittle. His clothes became immensely heavy. He felt his veins constrict, his blood growing slow and thick. The sensation of his own life was being drawn out, leaving behind only the dry, rasping husk of his failures.

The scarecrow—now filling the flannel shirt perfectly, its face tightening into Thomas's own rugged features, only whiter and colder—smiled a terrible, non-human smile.
“Thank you for the life,” the scarecrow whispered, its voice now Thomas’s own, rich and deep. “And the emptiness that drew me.”
Thomas collapsed to the floor. His clothing felt like heavy sacks. He tried to speak, but only a dry, pitiful rattle of chaff and bone fragments came from his mouth. He looked up at his wife, Sarah, who had just stepped into the kitchen.
She saw the man standing in Thomas’s flannel shirt, breathing in a way she hadn't seen him breathe in years. She ran to the scarecrow, embracing the new, strong, confident Thomas.
The real Thomas could only watch from the floor, his body now a discarded heap of skin and dry filler, unable to warn her. He had been replaced by the only thing capable of running a failing farm: an entity built only to endure emptiness.",3,1759330134.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False
1nva956,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1nva956/i_thought_my_neighbors_open_door_was_a_mistake/,I Thought My Neighbor’s Open Door Was a Mistake,"It was a warm Thursday evening, around 6 PM, when I pulled into my driveway after a long day at the office. The sun was still high, casting golden light across our quiet suburban street. As I grabbed my bag from the car, I noticed something odd—my neighbor Sarah’s front door was ajar. Sarah’s a friendly woman in her 30s, lives alone in the house across from mine. I figured she was probably carrying in groceries or airing out the place. Shrugging it off, I went inside, took my dog Max for a quick jog, and started cooking dinner for my partner, Emma, and myself. Just another ordinary evening… or so I thought.

It wasn’t until later, during Max’s evening walk, that a strange feeling crept over me. The sky had faded to a deep twilight, that eerie moment when the world feels caught between day and night. Max was tugging at his leash, tail wagging, until we passed Sarah’s house. Her door was still open—wide open—and her car was parked out front. But the house… it was completely dark. Not a flicker of light from any window. I stopped, staring at the black void of her doorway. Max froze too, his ears perked, his body tense. He let out a low whine, refusing to move closer. My stomach twisted. Something wasn’t right.

Sarah and I aren’t close—just the occasional wave or chat about her garden roses—but that open door gnawed at me. What if she’d fallen? Had a heart attack? I stepped onto her lawn, calling out, “Sarah? It’s Dan from across the street. You okay?” Silence hung heavy for a moment. Then, a voice answered from the darkness. “Hey, Dan,” she said, her voice rough, like she’d been coughing. “I’m just… eating dinner. What’s up?” I exhaled, relieved. “Your door’s open,” I said. “Just checking in.” Another pause—too long. “Oh, thanks,” she finally replied. “It’s so warm tonight, I wanted some air. I’ll shut it soon.” I nodded, tugged Max back, and finished our walk. But his whining stuck with me.

Friday was a slow day. Emma and I slept in, had coffee on the patio, and played fetch with Max. By mid-afternoon, clouds rolled in, and a steady drizzle started. I was in the living room, scrolling through my phone, when I glanced out the window. Sarah’s door was open again. Or… had it ever closed? The rain was heavier now, and her house was still pitch-black, like a void swallowing the light. Max, lounging nearby, lifted his head, staring at the house with his ears pinned back. I caught Emma’s eye. “Was Sarah’s door open this morning?” I asked. She frowned. “I… think so.”

Emma sat beside me, her face tense. “I just got off the phone with my cousin, Lisa, from the other side of the neighborhood,” she said. “She saw someone lurking outside her window last week.” My eyebrows shot up. “Lurking?” Emma nodded. “Yeah. A tall figure, watching her house. Others in her area saw it too. No break-ins, but… it’s creepy.” I asked what the figure looked like. Emma hesitated. “Lisa’s dramatic, you know that. She said it was a woman, but… too tall, too thin. Her face looked wrong, like her skin didn’t fit. And her eyes…” Emma shivered. “Too deep, almost hollow. When she smiled, Lisa swore she saw too many teeth.”

That description sent a chill down my spine. I thought of Sarah’s open door, her dark house. I had to warn her. I grabbed my jacket and stepped into the rain, Max barking frantically from the window as I crossed the street. Emma watched, trying to calm him. At Sarah’s porch, I paused. A strange sound came from inside—like wet fabric tearing, slow and deliberate. “Sarah?” I called. Her voice answered, sharp. “Dan? You again?” I swallowed. “There’s been some weird stuff in the neighborhood. Maybe close your door today.” Another pause. “I’m comfy on the couch,” she said, too close to the door. “Why don’t you… close it for me?”

Something about her voice felt… off. Too close, like she was inches from the door, not on the couch. I climbed the steps, heart pounding. I knew her living room was just inside, a light switch by the door. I’d go in, check on her, and leave. Simple. I glanced back—Emma and Max watching from our window. Taking a deep breath, I reached into the darkness. It was unnaturally black, like ink. My fingers brushed something… soft, warm, alive. I yanked my hand back. “Sarah?” I whispered. A low, guttural laugh answered—not hers. Then, rapid footsteps scampered deeper into the house, followed by a distant door creaking shut.

My hands shook as I found the light switch and flipped it. The entryway lit up—normal, with a coat rack and shoes. But my relief vanished when I stepped into the living room. Sarah was there… or what remained of her. She was slumped on the couch, her head tilted back, her face a raw, red mask—skinless. Her empty eye sockets stared at nothing, her mouth a gaping hole. Her arms and chest were peeled open, as if something had been stripping her apart… until I interrupted. I froze, my mind screaming this was a nightmare. But it wasn’t. I stumbled back into the rain, gasping.

I called the police, barely coherent. They came, took our statements, and searched the house. Days later, they’ve told me nothing. I can’t sleep, can’t eat. I keep hearing that laugh, feeling that fleshy touch, seeing Sarah’s ruined body. Who was I talking to? How did they mimic her voice so perfectly? And why, every night since, does Max sit by our front door, growling at something I can’t see?

1nva91c,https://i.redd.it/y5dpl83pjisf1.jpeg,"I think it’s time we really think about this. Many of our players are clearly grieving, yet we continue to remind them of his loss in the 20th each game. Should we reassess?","Our Diogo. It’s so tough to even put this into words, or say anything without sounding callous or cold. It is evident many of our players are completely off form: Salah, Macca, Ibou, Gakpo to name the main ones way off it. Players who are superstars in their own right, who won us the league last season with consistent performances: at times world class. These names mentioned, arguably the ones closest to him. The others that come to mind, Diaz, Darwin and Tsimi have left (Tsimi on loan). The ones who left are in a new environment, and that may help them as they’re not constantly reminded of him by being at the AXA, the dressing room, the gym, the parking garage, the coffee bar etc.

The ones who are still here however, will be constantly reminded of him. And the one key opportunity to be distracted, would be a match. Yet in the 20th minute, we start singing his name, because the 20th is forever his. As beautiful as this is, there is very little chance the players don’t hear this and that they’re not immediately reminded of him. How do we think that affects them? Could it motivate them to some degree, sure. But maybe not this early on. Everyone mourns and grieves differently, at different times and ways. But we saw how emotional Salah got a few games ago, in game. 

My difficult question: should we stop singing his name in the 20th each game - at least for now? Help the players focus on winning the game, for the fans, for this legendary team. Help them achieve all that they can by giving it their all each game, what this team is known for. The new players have also found it hard to settle because the staples around them are not holding their own and leading by example; except for a few. 

I’m sure he’s cheering us on and wants us to win it all - and not just for him. The last thing he’d want is his passing affecting our chances. So as fans and players, let’s give it our all. 

And us fans, may need to reassess our approach… for now.

1nva8wj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nva8wj/explore_the_best_electric_kettle_aroma_awk1810sd/,Explore the best electric kettle AROMA AWK-1810SD for your kitchen,"Testing the Aroma AWK-1810SD electric kettle over the past few weeks has been quite the experience. As someone who relies on a hot cup of tea to kickstart my mornings and often ends my evenings with a soothing chamomile brew, I was excited to see what this stainless steel digital kettle could bring to the table. With its sleek design and programmable features, I had high expectations, and I wasn't entirely disappointed, though a few quirks did catch my attention.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This kettle’s brushed stainless steel finish is modern, chic, and fits perfectly on any countertop. It’s not just about aesthetics though; the build feels durable and well-made, which speaks to its longevity. Compact in size, yet roomy enough to boil up to 1.7 liters, it doesn’t take over your counter while still catering to multiple users at home. I especially noticed how well the cordless pouring feature works – no awkward wrestles with cords trailing everywhere. It’s also relatively lightweight, which is great for a person like me who has had clunky kettles in the past, causing spills and frustration during pouring.

**Digital Features That Shine**  
One of the highlights of this kettle is its digital controls. I’ve been using them daily to choose the exact water temperature I need. Whether I’m heating water for green tea that demands precision or making oatmeal in the morning, this function ensures I never scald delicate ingredients. There’s even a Keep Warm mode that holds the temperature steady—genuinely lifesaving when I’ve been multitasking and don’t want to reheat water every half hour. Another small yet appreciated feature is the automatic shutoff—necessary for those days when I’m a little more forgetful than usual. 

**Check Aroma AWK-1810SD price on Amazon.**

**Performance Across Daily Usage**  
Boiling water with this unit is fast, thanks to its extra high 1500 wattage. I timed it multiple times while making tea, and it outperformed my old stovetop kettle by a substantial margin. It boiled water to the highest temperature setting in just a few minutes. The efficiency isn’t just appealing; it’s practical when time is short. That being said, there were moments where this rapid boiling produced a fair amount of steam. On one occasion, I noticed condensation forming on nearby appliances—so, a word of advice: give it a bit of breathing room.

**Highlights**  
• Stylish stainless steel exterior that complements kitchen aesthetics  
• Programmable temperature controls that cater to various beverages and meals  
• Quick boiling with its powerful 1500 watts  
• Keep Warm mode adds convenience for multitaskers  
• Cordless design makes pouring effortless and spill-free  

**Downsides**  
• Steam output can sometimes cause issues if the kettle isn’t positioned with ample vent space  
• While the digital interface is intuitive for the most part, the buttons feel slightly less tactile than I’d prefer 
• Cleaning the built-in tea filter can be a bit of a chore due to its fine mesh catching small particles  

**Product Alternatives**  
While testing this kettle, I considered how it stacks up to some competitors, like the Cuisinart CPK-17. That model shares similar features like variable temperature settings, but some user reviews mention leakage concerns after prolonged use—a problem I haven’t come across with this product so far. Another option, the OXO Brew Clarity Kettle, provides a sleeker finish and a quieter operation, but it lacks the Keep Warm functionality which has been crucial for my workflow. Ultimately, the Aroma AWK-1810SD strikes a middle ground between affordability and features.

**Quality for Price**  
Given its robust build, feature-rich functionality, and overall reliability, I’d say this digital kettle offers solid value. It’s not priced as high as some luxury models, which means you are not paying purely for brand names, but it still delivers on some upper-tier features. For a household juggling everything from coffee drinkers to tea aficionados, it does well to cater to everyone without stretching the budget too much.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

about a little under a year ago i left my dads house, a lot of issues not worth talking about. just ended up not being safe there. my mom is dead and has been dead since i was around 5. i contacted my grandparents on my mothers side for a place to live for a little over a year so i could graduate and just move on to college with no more issues. 

we ended up having issues. my dad was a narcissist which was the main cause of a lot of the issues and my grandfather ended up being one too. i guess a lot of people do end up being with someone like their dad. 

last night was one of the worst fights we had and it all started with both of my grandparents getting drunk and just being outside enjoying themselves. i wasn’t out there i was finishing homework in my room. 

it gets to be about 9 pm, they come inside. my grandpa is blind and has diabetes, so my grandma makes sure he’s in bed and i believe gave him a shot. i heard them start to argue and they’ve argued before, nothing new. to me it sounded like playful arguing that soon turned into him attacking her, calling her names, threatening her. i heard him get up out of his room to go bother her in the living room after she ignored all of his attacks and threats. 

i get up to go try to stop whatever is happening because i would rather be dead than feel guilt about him hurting her in my presence. that turns into him getting physical with me and he is a 300 pound man. it was a very long night of trying to go into the house, him fighting us, threatening to kill us, and basically playing ring around the rosey around the kitchen island. we tried to go back at 12 AM and 4 AM and 6 AM all resulting in physical fights except for 6 AM being the one that he locked us out with the screen doors. i wanted clothes for school so i could atleast get a break. we went to mcdonald’s, got coffee, then have been sitting in a grocery store parking lot ever since. i have someone who i would be able to live with but this means moving two hours away and closer to my dad. there’s also a bunch of paperwork she wants done just for legality and our safety.

I’m sorry I just realised how long this post is.


30M from UK. Stayed 1 week, spent way over budget but had a great time. My experience was much different to what I imagined it would be.

Day 1:
Checked into Page 10 Hotel at 2pm and ordered a girl from TF who was 22. She was good looking but a complete starfish and didn’t speak English. She gave a good bj to start though. Later that day I went to soi6. I’ve been to soi cowboy before so I thought it would be the same, but soi6 is more intense. So much groping and cock grabbing it’s unreal.  I bought a girl some lady drinks. She was 19 and very cute, but she only drank apple juice. I had a good time but wasn’t feeling soi6 at all, I wanted something more hands on.

After that I went to windmill 1 because I had read many things about it. I walked in and went straight upstairs. The girls are fairly average but there’s some good looking ones inside. I bought one some lady drinks and she took everything off and sat cowgirl on my lap humping me while I sucked her nipples. This is the sort of stuff I like. I was sitting in the corner where the shower tub is, where you can watch 2 girls naked having a shower. I stayed there for about 2 hours and went home.

Day 2
I woke up with really bad acid reflux from the alcohol so didn’t feel like drinking until night. I messaged a girl on ThaiFriendly whose photos looked like a 6 but she wore no makeup, no filter and had traditional Thai clothes and that appealed to me. She messaged me asking if I’m dangerous and I joked and said yes very. This girls name was Wan. Anyway Wan messaged back and said she won’t come because she’s afraid of me, but I persuaded her to come meet me near my hotel so she can sus me out first. She agreed. I go to meet her and was expecting her to look exactly like her photos, but she didn’t. She looked sooooo good. Like a 7.5. Great makeup, styled hair and a skimpy black blouse and skirt that showed all her skin. She was super shy and blushing, and wouldn’t look at me.

We went back to my hotel room and the first thing she does is clean my room lol! Then she goes to the balcony and points out all the spots she knows. She’s super bubbly and energetic but is shy to come near me, so I go close to her and put my arm around her and she screams and runs away in a playful manner. I honestly like this I don’t know why. After a few minutes I picked her up and carry her to my bed and she’s on top of me, I take her top off while she’s giggling and she lets me take her skirt off too. Omg! Her body is incredible. I ask if she goes to the gym and she said she does running and yoga.. I can tell because she has great abs. Her ass is small and round too, just perfect. I bang her for a good 30 minutes and say goodbye after getting her WhatsApp. 

Later that night I went to kink and windmill 2. There was a girl called Jenny in kink who is 29 but looks incredible, she stands out and is the best looking in the bar. Super slim body, blonde-brown hair and subtle eye contacts that actually suit her. After a few lady drinks she’s all over me, French kissing and everything.

Windmill 2 was also great. The girls this night were average or below average but I saw some good looking ones but they were already occupied. I decided to go all out and just get like 4 girls to come to me, bought them all lady drinks and sure enough they showed me a good time. You can finger and even lick the girls out here but I never licked. There was a 29 year old here who has a unique and cute face, she’s maybe a 5 or 6 but I really like her. I spent most of my time with her. There is also a mamasan who is 46 and her number is 14. She’s mega good fun and super sexy for an older lady too. She let me have a go on her tits and ass after I bought her some drinks. When she pulled her skirt up to let me slap it, she was fully tattooed down there, looked great.

Day 3:

Went to hunny lounge got a bj from a chick, weird experience but not my thing.

Hopped around a few beer bars playing pool. Met a 34 year old next to my hotel, I think the name was “malila bar”. Her name is Rain. She is fairly average looking but she’s super nice. She knows how to look after a guy. I wasn’t attracted to her at first but after spending time with her, I felt really comfortable. I got her WhatsApp and left.

Went to heaven above. Great bar with average girls I bought 2 girls a few lady drinks each and they were very hands on. Lots of kissing and titty touching, they also like to stroke my dick. I went upstairs to the hideout bar. It’s cosy but not my vibe.

After this, I went back to windmill 2 because I enjoyed it so much last time. When I walked in, the girls came straight to me because they remembered me, probably because my bill was 6000 last night. I got a selection of girls including the same 29 year old from last night, I’ll call her Sae. At this point I’m really liking her, but then I notice a VERY young and attractive girl walk up to me and sit next to me. She’s called Adea. She’s 18, extremely shy and brand new to barwork. She’s been working at windmill 3 weeks. This girl is a 9 or 10, like she’s extremely attractive. I could tell she was new because the older girls were encouraging her to ask me for a drink but she was too shy to ask. I bought her many drinks anyway. She was hesitant to take her clothes off but did in the end and wow, she has very nice tits with pale nipple and a completely bald pussy that is soft to the touch. She gave me her instagram and one of the older girls gave her a stiff look but said it’s ok she won’t tell anyone.

After windmill closed, 5 of us decided to go to Myst and Adea wanted to join. When we got to Myst, we went inside but Adea was still outside with another girl. They refused to let Adea in because she was too young and I felt so bad. I wanted to leave and go with Adea but the other girls were getting pissed at me, so I told Adea she can go home and we will meet again tomorrow. One of the other girls wanted to come home with me but I was so drunk and said I just want to sleep and not have sex. She said it’s fine. She came to my hotel and had sex with me anyway. It was bad sex cause I was so drunk. I didn’t pay her.

Day 4:

I woke up and messaged Adea straight away and apologised. I asked her if she wants to come to my hotel and she agreed but we didn’t mention a price. She told me she has never gone with a customer before, but I didn’t believe it of course. Anyway, Adea arrives at my hotel but wouldn’t come in, she asked me to meet her outside. I go outside and she’s stood under a tree about 50 meters down the road. She looked absolutely fucking gorgeous. Cute floral pink blouse and tight jeans. She’s 5ft and very very cute and sweet looking.

We walk into the hotel lobby and the front desk asks for ID. She looks confused and that makes me confused, so she tells me to wait and goes to sit down on a seat. After a minute of fumbling around, she gets a photo of her ID, maybe fake ID on her phone and the front desk accepts it.

We get to the hotel room and she’s super shy, saying it’s her first time with a customer. I tell her she’s lying and many customers barfine her. She tells me she has always refused the barfine because she’s too uncomfortable going back with customers. At this point I’m starting to believe it. She wouldn’t let me undress her unless I fully undressed first lol, so I agreed and she gives me very nice bj. Now I’m starting to think it’s not her first time. I take her clothes off and she keeps saying “I shy I shy” but in the end she agrees. We bang for a good while. Might be the best sex I’ve ever had. I gave her 3000 and she left. I told her I’d come back to windmill later.

Later that night I go to a few different clubs. I went to club fate and it was quite wild. 2 girls sat next to me in their 30s, fairly ugly but good fun, I bought them some lady drinks and they just got my dick out in the bar and started sucked. Usually i would be too shy for this but it just sort of happened so quick. I left shortly after and went to kink again. I saw Jenny again and she came straight to me, I asked her to go get 2 of her best friends to come sit with us, she did. 1 of the girls was a babe, the other was also good looking. Having 3 fit girls groping and riding you is honestly such a fun experience, I loved it.

Around midnight I went back to windmill and saw Adea but she was with another Japanese guy. I was sat right next to them. The Japanese guy asked to barfine her but she refused, I don’t know if it’s just because I was there. Anyway, Adea is sitting next to this Japanese guy but she’s leaning over to me saying she misses me and wants to sit with me while stroking my hand. Typical bar girl tactics. Adea goes to dance and I buy some drinks for about 4 girls including Sae who I also like. We play some dice games while groping kissing etc. after Adea finishes dancing, she comes straight to me and sits on top of me. She wouldn’t kiss me because I was “kissing too many other girls” haha! I didn’t know what to think of this.

Anyway, Adea tells me she got a fake ID that says she’s 20 and she can get into the bar later, so me, Adea, Sae and another girl all agree to go to republic once windmill closes. Well, bar closes and we go to republic but once again, she can’t get in even with fake id, because it’s a photo on her phone. At this point, I didn’t want to go without Adea so we go to a beer bar. The other girl goes home so it’s just me, Adea and Sae, just want I wanted. I asked them both to come back to my hotel for the night and Sae agrees but Adea refuses. This kinda shocked me because I assumed bargirls are up for anything. I ask Adea why not, and she says she doesn’t want to, she’s too shy and will only go back if it’s just me and her. I felt conflicted because I hadn’t spent the night with Sae yet, but I was more attracted to Adea. Sae tries to convince Adea to come but she wouldn’t budge. 

In the end, I ended up telling Sae to go home and that I would go with her tomorrow, but would pay her now. She agreed to this and went home. Now it’s just me and Adea and we go back to the hotel. It was so great. We are in bed naked rolling over eachother and I’m rubbing my cock against her pussy and teasing to put it in and she says condom? And I say yes, but then she just puts my dick inside her. I would never usually do this but I genuinely think she’s clean because her pussy smells good. We bang for like 1 hour and fall asleep

Day 5:

Woke up with Adea I could barely sleep because she snores. Not loud but more like a cat. It’s quite cute actually. We have sex again and I pay her 3000 and she leaves.

I check my phone and Wan, the yoga girl from ThaiFriendly messaged me asking if I want to meet. I said sure. We go to the beach and have some coffee and just talk about life. She’s a very nice person. I spent about 3 hours with her, went to the mall, bought her some cheap hair clips. We didn’t go back to the hotel. Just spent some time together, then she left.

Later that night around 9pm I message Sae from yesterday who I paid in advance and she agrees to meet me. We didn’t go to my hotel, but went to walking street instead. This chick suggested going to some gogo bars which really caught me off guard. We go to a bar called Atmos and I buy a girl 1 drink and the mamasan 1 drink, but when the bill comes, it says 4 lady drinks and I tell them I’m not paying for that when I said 1 each. My girl agreed with me and said they shouldn’t do that and she says she will pay the bill cause I refused, and she did. It’s crazy how they rip me off on the First Lady drinks when I would’ve been willing to spend 5000+. I left after 5 minutes.

We decided to go to XS and I ask her to pick out a girl and I will too. This bar is great, the girls are fit, there’s lots of them and the bar is usually quite full. Anyway, I pick out a 19 year old who is an absolute babe, while she picks out a 23 year old. They both sit with us, the 19 yo on my lap and the 23 next to me. My windmill girl is loving it and she goes straight in to feel their tits haha! I thought this was fucking hilarious. My windmill girl grabs my hand, then pulls down the girls bra and pushes me hand to her tits. Now, I’m quite shy so I usually wait until my bargirl imitates the touching before I do, so having this windmill girl to force me into was really good. Also, Sae, my windmill girl just seems to get along with any bar girl, it’s like they’re family. I honestly love having a bar girl with me in the gogo bars because all the girls seem to just have a good time while I get to grope the shit out of them.

After XS  we went to windmill 1. Sae works at windmill 2 so she wasn’t allowed to go there. When we get to windmill 1, we go straight upstairs and Sae knows some of the girls who work there. I ask her to pick out whoever she wants and I’ll do the same. After about 15 minutes I’ve got 3 girls and sae riding me. I was sat next to some Indian dude who was ladyless and give me the thumbs up. He left and gave me his full pack of cigs for some reason. Anyway, after about 10 lady drinks, the girls pull out the blue cloth and put it over my lap. I was confused at this, but then she pulls down my shorts so my dick is out, covered by this cloth, and she just starts sucking. My girl Sae is pushing her head down on my cock and is having a great time.

After windmill, we decide to go to my hotel and I banged sae for a good hour. She was so so wet at one point and I loved it. One thing I’ve learned is the older girls are genuinely more fun. Sae is 29 but knows how to have a great night whereas Adea, the 18 year old from before was too shy to do certain things. 

Day 6:

This was my last proper night and probably my worst night.

Around 5pm I went to malila bar where I met Rain again from the other day, the 34 year old. We played some pool and I won 6-5. This girl is incredibly nice, warm and pleasant to be around, even though she’s a few years older than me. I actually ended up bar fining her because I liked being with her. This was a huge mistake. 

We went to tree town and played some pool for a while and got tipsy, then headed to walking street at about 11pm. We sat in a bar (I think it was called frog bar) very large with many tables and music. We had about 4 drinks each, but she got drunk MUCH MUCH faster than I did. I was somewhat drunk but she was like, eyes rolling into her eyelids drunk, even after only about 8 samsong cokes. She must’ve been drinking a bit before I bar fined her.

Anyway I ask her if she wanted to go to some gogo bars and she agreed. She also said she would be happy for me to buy lady drinks for other girls. This was a good sign because I thought she would be just like Sae but I was completely wrong.

We went to XS and found the same 2 girls who I was with last night with sae. I bought some lady drinks and it was ok but Rain was not really into it. She was super super drunk at this point and was acting more like a burden than a good time. We ended up paying and went to windmill 2 instead. I don’t know what the fuck I was thinking bringing her to windmill 2, because this is where Sae works. Adea had a day off today which I already knew.

Anyway we go to windmill 2 upstairs and sure enough, all the girls come to me including Sae. So I’m sat with Sae and Rain and a few other girls but Rain is almost falling asleep and I’m getting a bit frustrated. This is when I asked her to go home and I would pay her extra for her time. I honestly just wanted to be alone. She just shrugs. I pay the bill and take Rain outside and tell her I’ll order her a taxi and give her some money (a reasonable amount) and she just bursts out crying. I didn’t know what to do. We talked for about 30 mins before I slipped some cash into her handbag and told her how I felt that she wasn’t enjoying herself and I want to spend the rest of the night alone. This made her cry even more and she said she didn’t want money, she was just upset that I didn’t want her. Every word she spoke made me feel worse and worse. This girl is genuinely an amazing person but I just didn’t wanna spend my last night in Pattaya with a girl who was stumbling around and falling asleep next to me. At one point I just left and told her to get home safe. I massively regret this but I was drunk. Looking back I wish I just stayed with her, got some food and took her home.

But no, I went back to windmill 2 to be with Sae. Stayed with her until the bar closed and she agreed to meet me after. When she finished, we went to a bar called “friendly restaurant” which is a 24/7 huge food, beer and pool bar that is busy at around 5am. The experience here was crazy. You see the sun come up yet people are still drinking, eating and playing pool. At some point around 8am, you see regular people coming for breakfast and the place suddenly becomes this mix of drunken Thai girls and regular people starting their day. We got home by about 8:30am and slept together, it was ok. We didn’t have sex when we woke up. I ended up packing my stuff and she helped me, then I checked out.

Overall, I regret not going with Adea on my last day. In fact, I regret not going to more bars but I guess I was just too comfortable with the bars I went to because they felt familiar to me by the end of my holiday.

After I left Pattaya, Adea messaged me and asked me why I just left without saying goodbye. She seemed kinda pissed off. She said she really liked me and was waiting for me to message her because I promised I would meet her one more time. I felt bad. I asked her to send me a photo of her so I can remember her. Then she sent me a photo of Sae, saying “like this?” And I didn’t know what to think of that. I didn’t know if it was genuine jealousy or just bar girl talk. Then she said “oh and by the way I went with a customer to day, I guess we are equal”. I asked her what’s up with the comments and she said she was mad that I went with Sae instead of her, but in the end she said she was really glad to meet me and she genuinely enjoyed spending time with me. I chose not to believe it but part of me thinks she did.

Rain (the drunk girl who I sent home) messaged me after I left and asked me why I didn’t want her. I explained that I actually did want her but we were both too drunk and not enjoying ourselves. She said she was enjoying herself. We’ve been speaking ever since and she is still an incredible girl, but we just had a bad night together. She told me to just forget about it and for us to continue to be friends. When I get back to Pattaya, she is going to be the first girl I meet, because she is the only one who I actually feel content with, despite our bad night together.

Sae didn’t really message me much after. She wished me farewell but that was it. At first I really liked her, but then she became more distant. I doubt I will go see her again.

Wan messaged me a lot and although I didn’t mention in my post, we met quite a few times just for chatting on the beach. She seems very genuine. Every time I went to meet her she would jump and spin around and clap like a little kid. She is such a good vibe. I will definitely meet her again on my next trip.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

By noon, it did. A man strolled into the little corner shop clutching a card he had cloned days earlier, blissfully unaware that the true owner of the original card was browsing the next aisle. Their eyes met as the cashier frowned at the payment terminal, and the realization struck both at once: thief and victim, perfectly aligned in time and space, like a cosmic joke. And instead of outrage or panic, something stranger unfolded - they leaned in and kissed, as if the absurdity demanded no other response.

Then he woke up, tangled in sheets, blinking at the ceiling fan that spun lazily overhead. No shop, no thief, no kiss - just the hollow taste of dream-logic that made no sense but felt bizarrely important.

SnapOn is a mod that lets you put a splitter directly on a miner and why not a pipe junction directly on a refinery.

Just yet another QoL mod that is nice to have, right? Right‽

Except what it allows you to do is to split a miner output without having the belt capacity for it. 

During development we cried that a miner mk3 can't do a full 1200 ppm output and maybe it could have 2 outputs? Coffee Stain said no and gave us Tier 9 and mk6 belts instead. Worth working for.

However, SnapOn let's you cheat and just put a splitter directly on the miner without that mk6 stuff.

I'm used to do my real proper steel plant thinking 480 or 780 ppm. 3 belts of coal n' iron ingots gives you 4.5 belts out.

Now I'm doing 6 × 600 in giving me  9 × 600 out. I'm looking at all the foundries and are just thinking wow!

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

My next-door neighbor (around 36F) is a mom of three boys (13, 9, and 4). She’s been incredibly generous—giving us tons of hand-me-downs from her kids, including a very expensive baby stroller. I’m genuinely grateful because it’s all been super helpful.

But ever since I brought my baby home from the hospital, she’s been, in my opinion, way too much. When my baby was under two weeks old, she came over for coffee and held her for more than an hour. Every time she sees me on the stairs, she just takes my daughter straight out of my arms. One time she knocked on our door, and when we opened it holding the baby, she literally took her, said “bye Mommy,” and shut her own door behind her. We were stunned.

I’ve tried to be understanding because she’s been good to us, but it’s starting to feel like a huge boundary issue. Today was my breaking point. My baby heard voices in the hallway and wanted to say hi, so I opened the door. The neighbor immediately scooped her up and said, “Can she come over for five minutes? I’ll bring her back.” I agreed—mainly because I needed to send an urgent email and was trying to be more relaxed about things.

Twenty minutes later I texted her saying I was done. After thirty minutes, I knocked to get my daughter back. Her older kids were watching anime on an absolutely massive TV screen, and my baby was sitting less than a meter away, just staring at it. We’re a no-screen household—and even if we weren’t, the setup was overwhelming.

Am I overreacting for being angry about this? (Extra context: she shares the same cultural background as my husband, so she sees herself as “family.” She’s also our landlord, and we’re trying to get a bigger apartment that she and her husband own.)

We’re Hem & Helm, a small Navy-family side hustle that started with a stubborn sewing machine, some surplus fabric, and a whole lot of coffee. What began as “let’s see if I can turn an old sea bag into something useful” turned into handmade pouches, Dopp kits, and zipper bags that are rugged enough for the deckplates but cheeky enough to make a Chief grin.

Most of our stuff is stitched from up-cycled or military-inspired fabrics — think ships, pin-ups, Rosie the Riveter, Navy sayings, and all the salty charm we can squeeze into a zipper bag. Each piece is cut and sewn by hand at our little “studio” (aka the dining room table when the kids are in bed).

We’re still a small shop, figuring it out one stitch at a time, but we wanted to share some of our projects (pic attached!) and connect with other sellers who know the grind of turning fabric and thread into something people love to carry.

I’ve been working on an business idea, a SaaS platform designed to reduce workplace stress and burnout.

Here’s the core concept:

\-The platform connects to your Google/Outlook calendar and analyzes your daily schedule.

\-It detects when your day is overloaded with meetings or back-to-back work sessions.

\-It then suggests smart break reminders like breathing exercises, short walks, eye relaxation, meditation, or a quick coffee/tea break.

\-The tool tracks a Stress Score and Wellness Score so you can actually see your progress over time.

\-For teams, there’s an admin dashboard that shows aggregated statistics (average breaks, team stress trends, participation rates) to help managers improve employee wellbeing.

The idea is simple: instead of you having to remember to take care of yourself, the system integrates directly into your routine and nudges you at the right moments.

I’d love to hear your thoughts:

\-Would this be something you’d find useful in your workday?

\-What features would make it valuable for you (as an individual or for your company)?

\-Any red flags or deal breakers that you’d immediately see?

Really appreciate any honest feedback – it really would help me find out whether this is worth pursuing further.

but there’s a really consistent issue at my store with communication and I kinda keep having to take the fall for it and it’s fucking killing me. Like on DTO I’ll tell the drive bar we need a mobile, the name, what the drink is, etc. They won’t answer, the mobile gets to the window, I say we need it, they ask what it is. And then I get told “you need to communicate with the drive bar.” Warming will ask what’s needed, I say “one second,” because I am not physically next to the DMP or am having to help a customer at the window or something, but I do truly mean one second, and rather than waiting one second, they just ask me again, like it will change the fact that I need one second. If I ask a question, though, like where something got moved to, I get treated like I’m an idiot. Instead of asking what I need help, the SSVs just start moving all of my stuff, so I don’t know where anything is and I get overwhelmed. I have communicated multiple times that that doesn’t work or help me, and multiple SMs told me that was the correct thing to do, but they keep doing it. And then when I start getting ever so slightly irritated with the constant communication issues, which I’ve brought up a million times, I get pulled off the floor to talk with my SM. 

I don’t understand why instead of pulling me aside, we could just communicate. And some of my shifts are just rather degrading towards me, and I don’t really know what I did to deserve it other than wanting to go to work. 

Not only does it make my job harder, but it just makes feel like everyone fucking hates me. Like ur boss is telling you to communicate with me and to be nice, that’s ur income, it’s worth your source of income to treat me worse than the rest of the staff? Like it’s that high on the priority list?? I know that’s not how that works and it’s not intentional or whatever, but how are you ignoring me, calling me out for not being listened to, talking down to me, and degrading me about a disability, all on the clock, with the expectation that this is setting me up to do well? And how are you going to remind us all to “stay positive” and then not communicate with me and then scold me for not telling bar something that I have repeatedly told them? 

Like this job is actually making me borderline suicidal bc of how poorly I’m treated on the daily lol, it’s making me incredibly depressed. 

and yes I’m looking for other jobs, but the job market in my area is like… unbelievably bad. I’ve shown up to employment agencies to be told they’re out of jobs. 

And this isn’t to mention other issues I’ve had on the job: shifts making fun of me for a disability, having hot coffee tossed on me intentionally, sexist remarks, etc.

She’s been more understanding than I deserve but I can see how disappointed she is, this was supposed to be the ring.

Hey, friends! 

So, let’s get real for a second. How often do we scroll through our feeds and see all these AI breakthroughs and innovations? It’s like every other day, right? 🚀 But here’s the kicker—if you’re not actively upskilling, you might just be watching your AI job vanish faster than the latest TikTok meme!

👉 Let me drop some truth on you: waiting for the perfect moment to learn or upskill is a losing game. Really! 

**A few reasons why you should jump on this train NOW:**

1. **The World is Evolving Faster Than Your Coffee Cools ☕️**  
   Every week, new tools and AI applications pop up like mushrooms after the rain. If you're not keeping up, you could find yourself stuck in the ‘It used to be like this’ phase while everyone else rides the wave of innovation. 

2. **Your Skills Can Get Expired, Just Like Milk 🥛**  
   Sounds dramatic, but it's true! If you’re not constantly adapting, your once shiny skill set might end up as outdated as flip phones. 🥴

3. **Opportunities are Knocking, Don’t Leave Them Hanging! 🚪**  
   Companies are on the hunt for candidates who can navigate the ever-evolving tech landscape. Imagine being the candidate that can run rings around AI tools and grab that promotion or job you’ve been eyeing!

So how do you get started without feeling overwhelmed? Here’s what I recommend:

- **Set Small, Digestible Goals**  
   Try setting a goal to learn one new AI tool each week. You’ll be surprised at how much progress you make over a couple of months.

- **Online Courses Are Your Besties**  
   Seriously, check out this awesome educational program that dives deep into AI skills: [Imagine Education](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals). I mean, it’s a complete treasure trove of knowledge! 🎉 

- **Connect with Peers**  
   Join groups or forums (like this one!). Sharing knowledge, resources, and tips can make the learning journey a whole lot more fun. Plus, you’ll pick up things you never would have on your own.

- **Stay Curious**  
   That’s what it’s all about, right? Ask questions, explore, and don’t hesitate to dabble in areas you’re not familiar with. You never know what might spark your interest!

And hey, let’s not ignore the fact that we all have those moments where we feel like the learning curve is steep. But remember, we’re in this together! You’re not alone in this chaotic world of AI.

So, as we wrap this up, just remember—**Don’t wait! Get out there, get your hands dirty, and make your learning experience the best it can be.** The future is bright, and you want to be ready when the next round of opportunities come knocking. 🚀  

What are you upskilling in right now? Share your goals, tools, or even the challenges you’re facing—let’s support each other on this wild journey!",1,1759329364.0,AIContentAutomators,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

Alright, friends, gather 'round! Have you ever found yourself grinding day in and day out, only to feel like you’re sprinting on a hamster wheel? 🐹 I get it! The struggle is real. The good news? There are some sneaky strategies out there that can literally make your bank account sing without you having to show your face (or even break a sweat). 

**Let’s talk faceless growth strategies**—those golden nuggets that can boost your income while you sip your coffee, binge-watch Netflix, or even work on your side hustle. Sounds dreamy, right? 

Here’s why you should care:

- **More Freedom**: Nobody wants to be tied down to a desk for 40+ hours, am I right? 
- **True Passive Income**: You can set it, forget it, and watch the magic happen!
- **Weirdly Fun**: Who doesn’t love a little bit of moneymaking magic sprinkled into their life?

Here are some faceless strategies that are currently *popping off* (while they last):

1. **Content Automation**: You can create pre-made content and schedule it to drop when you sleep. Think of platforms where you can set it and forget it! Tools like [**Maximize Me**](https://www.checkout-ds24.com/redir/540531/maximizeme/) make this even easier—turn your ideas into a money-making machine without lifting a finger. 😴
  
2. **Affiliate Marketing**: You don’t need to be an influencer to earn from affiliate links! Find a niche you love, promote it in forums or blogs, and voila! Passive income while you snack away at your favorite chips. 

3. **Digital Products**: E-books, online courses, or templates? Oh my! This is where the real faceless magic comes in. Create once, sell forever. Imagine making money while you sleep! Just don’t forget to keep the quality up. 😉

4. **Drop Shipping**: Feel like a digital entrepreneur? Get into drop shipping! Your online store can be a cash cow without ever handling the product. Yes, please!

5. **Ad Revenue**: Create engaging videos or blogs (without showing your lovely face) and monetize them through ads. You'll just be watching the dough roll in! 💰

**But wait!** Here’s the kicker: you gotta act FAST. Some of these methods are trendy right now, but like all good things, they could be short-lived. So why not hustle creatively while the getting's good? Get inspired, dive into those strategies, and remember—the only thing stopping you is...well, you!

Do you have any faceless strategies in your arsenal? Or maybe you’re curious about how to dive into these money-making methods? Either way, let’s chat! Your thoughts might be the spark someone else needs! 😄✨",1,1759329243.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

[Fiddleford Hadron “Old Man” McGucket](https://imgur.com/a/t4Hk73w) is an old man who formerly lived in the Gravity Falls Junkyard and now resides in the Northwest Manor. Once a brilliant inventor who worked with Stanford Pines to create the trans-universal portal underneath the Mystery Shack, during a mishap while testing it, he was nearly sucked in, and saw something on the other side. Whatever he saw scarred him forever, leading him to create a memory gun and the Blind Eye Society. Over decades of blasting himself with the memory gun, McGucket lost all of his sanity. However, after “Society of the Blind Eye”, he regained most of his sanity and by the end of “Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back the Falls”, was fully back to normal. He represents the eyeglasses on the Zodiac, due to his intelligence and scholarly nature, as well as his distinct gold spectacles with green lenses that he is commonly seen wearing after “Society of the Blind Eye”.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

While prepping for my rides and hike this summer, I ran into some difficulties planning my routes and exporting them in .GPX format to put on my watch.

That's why, when I got back, I developed a web application (for now) called **Topograf**.

Here are the main features for this first public release:

* Simple route creation using pins to place on the map.
* Different route profiles (Hiking, walking, road cycling, MTB, or car)
* Ability to choose between the recommended route and the shortest route
* The possibility to add exclusions (Highways, tolls, ferries, or stairs/steps)
* Device location to easily find your starting point
* Mobile-responsive with the little menu that unfolds
* World wide map using OpenStreetMap as source
* **Finally, simple export of the route in .GPX format locally, just have to upload on your Garmin**

It is accessible via this link: [topograf.fr](http://topograf.fr)

**EDIT on 09/30**

Roadmap for the week

* ✅ 📈 Integration of an elevation profile graph, including distance, ascent, and descent.
* ✅ 🤖 Integration of AI to optimize routes. The AI, having a backend prompt focused on trail specialists and route planners, allows it to select the best route for you.
