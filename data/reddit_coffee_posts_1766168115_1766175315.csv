1pqv2rw,https://i.redd.it/q754iuwfx78g1.jpeg,My holiday strategy: crash a Christmas dinner and hope nobody notices the new “cousin.”,"TL;DR I’ll be in SF (Mission District) tomorrow thru 12/29 and would like to do something for Christmas. I don’t know anyone and would love an invitation to a dinner party or some sort of gathering!

Hi, I’m (39F) traveling solo to pet sit for 9 days. I’m caring for 2 poodles! My partner can’t come along and I don’t know anyone in the Bay Area. 

I’m more than willing to grab coffee or something first so you can get to know me. I’m a good conversationalist and enjoy dinner parties or other events.

I’m a Massachusetts native who moved to southern OR in 2020. I’m a pet sitter, humanitarian, photographer, researcher, writer, and I’m starting a genealogy project soon!

I’m an awful cook but I can bring whatever it is you need for the dinner! You can DM me or comment and I’ll reach out to you.

Cheers 🥂

1pquz25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1pquz25/from_rocks_to_rivers_what_is_happening/,"From rocks to rivers, what is happening?!?!","Ok everyone, this is the third week in a row my body has gone though this and I have no idea what is happening.

CW: poopy talk, literally

Usually after my weekly Zepbound shot (I'm at 10mg) I get some bloating and nasty burps for about a day or two and keep up my hydration and fiber for the inevitable constipation. But for the past three weeks something has been happening and I don't like it. 

My body blows up like a damn Macys Thanksgiving Day balloon. For days. I burp like it's my damn job and of course the smell is atrocious. But that's not all. 

I can't trust a fart. Like at all. Several times a day I sit down and a river comes out along with several farts. Like it practically explodes out of me. And this happens again, for days. Like by the time it's done it's the weekend right before my next weekly shot and then the cycle repeats.

I should mention none of this hurts at all. My stomach rumbles like crazy and the bloating is uncomfortable but I'm not in pain. 

What is happening?!?! Is it because it's the holidays and my diet is now all posole, tamales, and biscochitos plus the other sweets? Is it just the progression? Is it because Zepbound is just one of those detox teas in disguise and the laxative part has now kicked in? Am I pregnant despite the IUD???

I'm still drinking around the same amount of water I have been in the past. Minimum 64oz. I'm not doing coffee too much because the last thing I need is more laxative help and I've switched to Alani energy drinks. Like I said, diet hasn't been the best but not too terribly different. Gas-X has this far not been too effective in relieving the bloat.

If anyone else has had a similar experience please let me know and what worked for you because while not super inconvenient, it's not nice and puts a damper on things when I'm playing with the kids and then suddenly stand up and leave. ",1,1766174878.0,Zepbound,1,1.0,False

1pquw8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Patagonia/comments/1pquw8w/psa_skip_the_food_in_torres_del_paine_it_is_a/,"PSA: Skip the food in Torres del Paine. It is a mediocre, overpriced tourist trap.","​I know we do not go to Torres del Paine for the culinary scene, but I feel like people with discerning taste need to know just how bad the situation is inside the park.

​I ate at multiple places including Pampa Lodge, Hosteria Pehoe, Restaurant Pehoe Grill, and Refugio Vertice Paine Grande. My advice is to skip everything at all costs. The refugios here feel more like a gimmick than a representation of the Alps mountain huts many of us might be expecting.

​Here is the breakdown of the specific disappointments:
​Hosteria Pehoe (Breakfast)
This was exceptionally awful. It was a constant start to each day consisting of powdered eggs, boiled hot dogs, stale bread, and weak coffee. It was barely edible fuel, not a meal.
​Refugio Vertice Paine Grande
I tried the pizza here. It was premade, obviously frozen, and just not good. It is the kind of quality you would expect from a gas station, not a sit down meal in a national park.
​Restaurant Pehoe Grill
This place is run by Sodexo, a company notorious for running prison cafeterias. That should tell you everything you need to know. The food was slightly better in that they cooked the meat on an open flame, but everything else was a letdown. The ""salad"" was just lettuce with slices of tomato, and the Pisco Sour was bottled syrup rather than a fresh cocktail.

​The Cost
All of this was a minimum of 40,000 CLP per person, and that did not even include drinks, sides, desserts, etc.

​The Verdict
I am all game to eat meat, cheese, and granola bars for days. I have years of ski mountaineer and wilderness backpacj experience. Honestly, you are better off doing exactly that. The meals I saw at other refugios looked equally awful, boring, and bland. Do not waste your money eating in the park restaurants. Bring your own food.

I do recommend stopping for a beer and maybe a little snack (the food truck at El Chileno Trailhead has amazing potato fries). ",0,1766174677.0,Patagonia,1,0.5,False

Found some he liked but wanted to check his size so we went to the changing room. It was a big surprise. 

Woman only on one side, other genders the other, and the attendant gave the vibe of a TERF gestapo. My boyfriend commented what is this to me, what does this mean?  At that point he was given a token for the items he wanted to try on and frogmarched to the “other genders” just in case he was to go to the woman’s changing room. 

I was in two minds to get something for myself to try on and see the reaction (I pass well) but really did not have time as it was getting late and wanted a coffee at Costa where I was greeted with “what would you like mam?”

Although I nor my boyfriend were directly affected by the attitude in Primark, I felt and smelt the transphobia in the place and it was horrid.

I've had several long term relationships. 2 started in school, 2 were found online, one was meeting a friend of a friend. Had a relationship end this fall, and while that sucks, it's also like ""OKAY, HERE WE GO AGAIN x.x"" getting back into the grind to find someone.

But now being in my 30s, I find I have a better idea of what I want and prioritize. 

Agreeing on kids/similar politics/religion/pets is what I prioritize.  Basically I'm looking for an atheist, left-ish guy who doesn't have kids and doesn't want kids, and ideally, is sterilized. 

Thing is, aligning on all those categories is super rare. There's like a 1 in 600,000 chance that a random dude at a coffee shop meets what I'm looking for, so I don't actually think this is one of those ""get out and meet people"" situations. With odds like that, I'd be 72 before I actually found someone ""in the wild"" who met what I'm looking for.

I'm generally a happy person either in or outside of a relationship. But my equation has always been:

Good relationship > being single > neutral relationship > bad relationship

A good relationship always feels better than being single, but not all relationships are better than being single. Finding a good one where I genuinely see things lasting is just rare.

I've started asking friends of friends (and, lol... people I've gone on a few dates with but didn't work out with) if there's anyone in their life who matches what I'm looking for.  I have 1 blind date set up for 2026. We'll see how that goes =P

1pqumkc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nerdfighters/comments/1pqumkc/tea_theories/,Tea Theories,"In Hank’s census review he is initially perplexed by how the nerdfighter community (at least the census takers) are more tea drinkers, but the coffee sells much better. Overall this is likely a mixture of things, but I have some general ideas, but would also like to hear theories from others. Here are some of the possibilities that Hank mentioned and some I’ve thought of on my own.

1) There may be more tea drinkers, but coffee drinkers drink way more, probably daily. (I think this is a prime contributor no matter what).

2) The barrier to thinking of yourself as a “tea drinker” is WAY lower than that of a coffee drinker. I intentionally don’t keep coffee in the home because I would be an every day drinker if it was available, but I don’t have this issue with tea. I only have coffee once every few weeks when I want a pick-me-up but I wouldn’t really consider myself a “coffee drinker”. I have tea just about as frequently, but in my own home while chilling and compared to how most Americans don’t really drink tea, even the little I do drink puts me as a “tea drinker” in my head.

3) Census takers are more likely to drink tea (perhaps while filling out the census). The coffee drinkers are up and about ready to carpe diem and dont have time for your forms.

4) Brand loyalty. In my experience tea has WAY more variation brand to brand than coffee. I know there are differences to coffee snobs, but just like generally. To me the biggest variances in coffee are just roast level whereas even the same supposed tea type from two brand can be very different. As such, Keats & Co. is less likely to turn me from my trusted brands. A tea drinker may be more likely to already have their trusted tea shop or boutique and a coffee drinker have fine coffee. For the coffee drinkers in my life, they may have a brand they go to for whatever reason, but they tend to be slaves to convenience and could be persuaded from their grocery store brands quite easily (not to mention the broadly known industrial abuses in the coffee industry, though I’m sure it’s similar for tea).

5) James Hoffman has had deep impact on this primarily YouTube based community and which leads to nerdfighters being more into complex homebrew setups which gets more folks to buy the branded coffee.

These are all generally conjecture and a little fun from a semi-personal semi-informed perspective. I would love to hear other’s ideas!",6,1766174037.0,nerdfighters,3,1.0,False
1pqumfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1pqumfv/friends_who_arent_really_what_to_do/,"""Friends"" who aren't, really - what to do?","I've (45 F) been suspecting this for a while. 
Friends who are there when things are good, up for a coffee or a beer, but not in need. 

These are people I've considered friends - I'm always there to help with whatever needs they have. Bad day at work? Talk to me. Quarreling with your SO? Talk to me. Moving? I'll help. Broken bone? I'll go shopping, do your dishes, take trash out, etc. 

A few weeks ago I broke four bones in my hand, and needed surgery. 
All my so-called friends are aware of this. Not ONE asked if I need any help - groceries, housekeeping, whatever. 

This made me feel very lonely. Also, to make everything more interesting, I've been suffering from very depressive bipolar with anxiety all my life. (My family does not live close by.)

I felt abandoned by everyone. I mentioned to one person that I needed help, he automatically went into a defensive position saying ""he's busy"" - I didn't even ask him. 
Another friend, who I contacted the Thursday after my surgery and asked for help during the weekend, forgot about it until late Sunday, but then he needed a ""me-day"".
I wasn't asking for much, just ten minutes help around the house. 

These things of course triggered my feelings of worthlessness and ""being a bother"", so I went on a sh*t downward spiral.

Is it too much to ask that the people you've helped, come to your aid?

Monitors chime, stretchers roll, and voices overlap in a rhythm you’re still learning. Then the overhead speaker calls: “Code Blue, Trauma Bay One.”

You don’t know the dynamics here yet. The attending with green-gray eyes looks steady, though exhaustion edges his calm. The trauma surgeon, ICU doctor, charge nurse, paramedic, and administrator form the hospital’s backbone, each with their own pressures and priorities.

Every shift will test you—some moments routine, others heavy enough to follow you home. In the blur of crises and 10 p.m. coffee, you’ll discover what you’re capable of—and what this place might take from you.

baconbeard: ARR… YOU SANK MY LAST SHIP… BUT THIS ONE HAS DOUBLE THE FPS DROPS!

asdwz458: i removed the cannons because they were taking up my leg room

groovy: BRO THIS IS FUCKING BULLSHI- oh wait i can just create new ones using my new btools-

baconbeard: NOPE TOO LATE

tangomangle: i can’t… move… my nuggets… falling… in slow… motion…

carl: MY LIFE IS A SLIDESHOW

[meanwhile at robloxia’s blue house]

stickmasterluke: shedletsky, where’s our army?!
shedletsky: half of them are stuck in the lava obby, the other half is arguing about whether bloxxydam or robloxia invented tix first
john: also our engineers are busy building the trenches first
luke: …we’re so dead

(theamazeman calls over radio)

theamazeman: luke! check the sky!

baconbeard: surrender your ship!

groovy: never! avi, full power!

avi: we’re already at full power!

groovy: then go fuller!

david: so… bloxxydam just declared official war.
stickmasterluke: oh great.

david: also, someone gave the bacon pirates nukes.

stickmasterluke: (throws coffee cup)

[robloxia HQ, war room]

stickmasterluke: alright people, we have a situation.

shedletsky: (sipping coffee) understatement of the century.

david: bloxxydam has officially declared war, bacon pirates have nukes, someone crashed 37 zeppelins on the highway, and half our army is stuck on stage 3 of the lava obby.

john doe: stage 3??? seriously??? that one’s literally just a jump.

shedletsky: yeah, apparently some guy fell and blocked the checkpoint with his avatar, now everyone spawns in the lava.
stickmasterluke: …this is going to be the dumbest war in history.

(a soldier bursts in)

soldier: SIR!! the zeppelin noob head just dropped… not bombs… but… points outside

(they look out the window. hundreds of crates are falling from the sky. when they break open, thousands of robloxians flood the streets grabbing robux like black friday shoppers.)

stickmasterluke: this is worse than bombs… this is inflation.

[meanwhile, bloxxydam secret base – the dam fortress]

theamazeman: haha… look at them suffer…

inyo22: uh boss… i think they’re just… buying limited hats with all the free robux.

theamazeman: that’s the point, inyo… the economy will crash… ugc creators will cry… chaos will reign…

phalack: but won’t bloxxydam also suffer?

theamazeman: nah we turned off trading in our country. their limiteds are stuck at home. ours are safe. evil laugh

(a soldier runs in)

soldier: sir! robloxia forces are gathering near the border!

theamazeman: excellent… let them come… the lava obby will take care of them.

(camera pans outside: the dam has a giant 2012 lava obby built across the front gate. soldiers fall off into the lava every few seconds.)

[back on the groovygang’s ship]

groovy: alright, so, recap: baconbeard sank again, bloxxydam declared war, and apparently someone gave nukes to the pirates??

tangomangle: yeah i heard they put the nukes in crates labeled “FREE DOMINUS” so no one questioned it.

avi: *looking at radar* uh… guys? there’s like… fifty red dots behind us.

carl: fifty what?

avi: ships. big ones. bloxxydam navy.

(they all look back. a massive bloxxydam fleet is 
chasing them, sails painted with “DOWN WITH ROBLOXIA” in bright red letters.)

groovy: alright… plan b.

carl: what’s plan b?

groovy: we don’t have a plan b. i just hoped saying that would make us look smarter.

tangomangle: GIVE ME THE CANNONS I’LL DO PLAN C

asdwz458: what’s plan c?

tangomangle: chaos.

(he loads every single cannonball, half a crate of fireworks, and a btools cube into the cannon.)

groovy: WAIT NOT THE BTOOLS-

(BOOM. entire cannon explodes. ship speeds up from recoil, narrowly escaping the bloxxydam fleet.)

avi: we just lost half the deck but hey, we’re alive.

groovy: i hate this job so much.

[robloxia high school – evacuation center]

intercom principal: attention… uh… students… and teachers… and uh… anyone still in the building… the war is apparently official now. stay calm.

(half the ceiling falls in from a stray zeppelin crate. chaos erupts.)

yung giez gaela: bro this is literally the best day of school ever. no classes, free loot boxes falling from the sky…

shiotachen: yeah until you get crushed by a 500-ton robux crate.

stickmasterluke: soldiers… today we fight for robloxia! for freedom! for the economy!

random soldier: do we get paid?

stickmasterluke: yes. in robux.

soldiers: LET’S GOOOOOOOOOO

(the army charges across the border… straight into the lava obby. half of them fall in instantly.)

shedletsky: …this is going to be a long war.

[bloxxydam command center]

theamazeman: hehe… look at them burn… the lava obby never fails…

inyo22: sir… sir… uh… one of them found the secret shortcut on the left side.

theamazeman: WHAT.

soldier: they’re inside the dam fortress.

[in the obby]
soldier 1: oh wait i just realized (goes around the obby, walking on a patch of grass that was conveniently placed there totally not just because of plot armor)

soldier 2: thats what i tried to say but couldnt since i was in the back of the line

soldier 6: YOU BLIND DIMWITS

(they rush inside)

(alarms blare. bloxxydam soldiers scramble. the robloxian army pours into the fortress courtyard. chaos erupts. bloxxydam soldiers use paintball guns, robloxians fight with swords and rocket launchers.)

john doe: (fighting off soldiers) THIS IS FOR TIX BEING REMOVED YOU MONSTERS

[back on the ocean – bloxxydam fleet vs groovygang]

(the bloxxydam ships finally catch up. cannonballs fly. groovygang’s ship zigzags wildly.)

avi: we can’t outrun them!

tangomangle: THEN WE DON’T OUTRUN THEM. WE OUT-CRAZY THEM.

(he pulls out a stash of fireworks, ties them to chickens, lights the fuse.)

groovy: …what the hell are you doing?

tangomangle: aerial chicken strike.

(the chickens launch into the air, fireworks explode mid-flight, raining chaos on the bloxxydam ships. sails catch fire. soldiers scream. ships crash into each other.)

carl: …it actually worked…

groovy: i don’t know whether to thank you or call a therapist.

[roblox HQ]

david: …this is getting out of hand.

stickmasterluke (over radio): “out of hand”?? david, bloxxydam just sent a giant noob mech stomping across the border!!

david: …a what.

shedletsky: yeah, it’s like… forty feet tall, made of laggy parts, powered by free robux.

david: …alright i’m calling in the mods.

(cut to a squad of moderators parachuting in with banhammers.)

[roblox HQ, rooftop]

(the moderators land dramatically, swinging banhammers like they’re in a michael bay movie)

mod #1: who do we ban first?

david: bloxxydam forces. every soldier. every nuke. every noob mech.

mod #2: …sir… the noob mech is technically a player-made model. it’s… uh… under terms of service.

david: I DON’T CARE IF IT’S IN THE MUSEUM, BAN IT.

(the mods charge toward the battlefield, each one swinging a glowing blue banhammer. every time it hits, a bloxxydam soldier vanishes with a “this account has been terminated” message floating above the smoke.)

stickmasterluke (over radio): mods are in. repeat, mods are in.

shedletsky: yeah well the noob mech just kicked over our entire left flank so maybe hurry it up.

[robloxian army – inside the dam fortress]

(chaos everywhere. robloxians storm the courtyard, fighting bloxxydam defenders who shoot paintball guns, throw crates, and yell stuff like “FOR BLOXXY!”)

john doe: THIS IS FOR TIX! (hits a soldier with a rocket launcher)

random soldier: sir that was one of our guys

john doe: oh. well… he should’ve moved.

(the noob mech’s footsteps shake the ground as it approaches the fortress gates)

soldier: IT’S HERE!!!

(the noob mech kicks the front gate open like it’s a cardboard box. it roars in the most laggy, robotic voice ever.)

noob mech: RRRRREEEESSSSPPPPPAAAWWWNNNN POOOIIIINNNTTSSSS DDEESSTTRROOOYYYEEDDDDD

(the mech fires its arm cannon. entire sections of the fortress explode. robloxians scatter.)

stickmasterluke: HOLD THE LINE!!

shedletsky: HOLD THE WHAT?! THE LINE IS IN FLAMES, LUKE!!!

(then suddenly…)

mod #1: don’t worry… we brought backup.

(a helicopter arrives. it drops… the ultimate weapon… THE BANBOT 9000. a giant robot made entirely of banhammers.)

banbot 9000: (in deep voice) ACCOUNT… TERMINATED.

(it grabs the noob mech by the head and slams it into the lava obby. explosion. half the map disappears. bloxxydam soldiers scream in laggy terror.)

[groovygang: still on the ocean]

avi: so uh… guys… i think half the mainland just exploded.

tangomangle: good. less people to steal my nuggets.

asdwz458: no wait look, the bloxxydam fleet’s retreating!

groovy: what? why?

carl: maybe they heard about the banbot.

(a radio crackles)

stickmasterluke: groovy, we need you at the dam NOW.

groovy: luke, buddy, pal… our ship is literally on fire.

luke: AND SO IS THE COUNTRY, GET OVER HERE.

(groovygang speeds toward the mainland, leaving behind baconbeard clinging to a piece of driftwood.)

baconbeard: mark my words… i’ll be back… with EVEN MORE FPS DROPS…

[inside the dam: final battle]

(the bloxxydam leader, theamazeman, stands on the control tower, watching chaos unfold. soldiers running everywhere, robloxians fighting through every hallway.)

theamazeman: so… this is it… huh?

inyo22: sir we could… like… surrender.

theamazeman: surrender?? to ROBLOXIA??? never!

phalack: but sir half the fortress is gone, the noob mech is in pieces, and the banbot is literally tearing through our walls.

theamazeman: …ok maybe a temporary surrender.

(a giant explosion outside. the banbot 9000 punches through the wall like the kool-aid man.)

banbot 9000: ACCOUNT… PERMANENTLY… TERMINATED.

theamazeman: ok yeah we surrender.

[roblox HQ one day later]

(david sits at a table with stickmasterluke, shedletsky, groovy, tangomangle, and about 500 tired soldiers.)

david: so… bloxxydam officially signed the peace treaty.

stickmasterluke: yep. war’s over.

shedletsky: economy’s still on fire though.

groovy: can we get paid?

david: in robux or real money?

groovy: …robux. obviously.

(tangomangle walks in with a giant bag.)

tangomangle: good news. i found my nuggets.

shedletsky: …where were they?

tangomangle: inside the noob mech.

everyone: …what.

1pquk52,https://i.redd.it/feww4g8mt78g1.jpeg,How do I plan the best kitchen layout - work triangle vs zones?,"If you’ve started thinking about your kitchen remodel, you’ve probably come across two layout terms that seem to battle for attention: the *work triangle* and the *zone layout*. Both aim to make your kitchen more efficient, but which one actually works best for you depends on how your family uses the space.

# The classic work triangle: timeless for a reason

The work triangle connects your sink, stove, and refrigerator with imaginary lines. The idea is simple: these three key areas should be close enough to move between easily but far enough apart to prevent crowding.

It’s a principle born in the 1940s, and it still works well for smaller or traditionally shaped kitchens where one or two people do most of the cooking.  
If you rarely have more than one cook in the space, or you prefer a traditional kitchen layout, the triangle offers simplicity and flow.

However, modern kitchens have changed. Open floor plans, large islands, and multiple appliances make it hard to stick to a neat triangle. That is where zones come in.

# The modern zone layout: built for today’s families

Zone-based design organizes your kitchen into specific task areas rather than a single triangle.  
For example, you might have:

* **Prep zone:** near the sink, cutting boards, and knives.
* **Cooking zone:** surrounding your stove, oven, and cookware.
* **Cleaning zone:** anchored by the sink and dishwasher.
* **Storage zone:** where your pantry and food containers live.
* **Beverage zone:** if you have a coffee station or wine fridge.

Zone layouts are ideal for families or anyone who uses the kitchen for more than just cooking. They allow multiple people to work comfortably without crossing paths or bumping into each other.

# Which one is right for you?

If your home is smaller and you value efficiency for one cook, the triangle will likely serve you well. But if you host, share cooking duties, or want a more flexible setup, zones offer a better fit for how people actually use modern kitchens.

At **Phoenix Home Remodeling**, we’ve found that most homeowners today benefit from a hybrid approach, keeping the work triangle for the core cooking area while layering in functional zones for storage, prep, and socializing. This combination keeps movement efficient without limiting how the space can adapt to your lifestyle.

# A few planning tips to keep in mind

* Think about *how* you cook. Do you like to prep at the island or near the sink? That determines where to place your appliances.
* Prioritize *counter space* over symmetry. Function always wins in a well-planned kitchen.
* If you’re remodeling an open-concept home, use your island as a multi-zone hub that balances prep, serving, and socializing.
* Do not forget lighting. Task lighting over each zone ensures safety and visibility.

A well-planned kitchen isn’t just about geometry. It’s about supporting how you actually live and cook. The best layout blends comfort, flow, and smart design choices that match your daily routine.

If you’re starting your kitchen remodel, our [**Kitchen Remodel Playbook**](https://phxhomeremodeling.com/guides/the-kitchen-remodel-playbook/?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=phr-subreddit) is a great free resource. It explains how to plan your layout, avoid common design mistakes, and create a kitchen that functions beautifully for years to come.

A kitchen layout isn’t one size fits all. The goal is to design a space that feels natural every time you walk in, whether you’re brewing coffee or hosting dinner for twelve.",1,1766173865.0,Phoenixhomeremodeling,0,1.0,False

The tool lets you:

* drag & drop audio files (common formats)
* automatically read track lengths
* split the tracks into Side A / Side B with durations as equal as possible
* play back each side as a playlist
* export playlists if needed

Why should undermining democracy by rejecting the 2025 election outcome, and excluding 41% of the population, be justified by those weak statements?","**""Floor crossing is technically legal!""**

Things that are deeply immoral and disgusting can be technically legal, the law isn't always right.

A 50 year old predator can legally get with a 16 year old in this country, how does legality automatically excuse a disgusting action?

**""Liberal-Conservative crossers did it before too!""**

It was wrong when they did it too. Floor crossing laws need to be changed. The NDP Bill C-306 (An Act to amend the Parliament of Canada Act political affiliation) was right.

But this is new. Never before has floor crossing overthrown a democratic minority elected government vote by the people, into a underhanded majority.

**""You vote only for an individual, not a party""**

Not true in practice.

In the 2025 election, Nanos found that 84.7% of Canadians voted for an individual because they presented themselves as with the party, not because of the candidate as an individual which is only 7%.

The party name is also next to the individual's name on the ballot. Should we champion election deception as the new definition of ""democracy"" just because it's technically legal?

**Lastly**

The 2025 democratic vote **electing only a minority Liberal government** cannot be ignored without consequence. The 41% of the population are still here in the country.

Democracy is what allows for peace. If you want Liberals, Conservatives, and NDPs to peacefully be able to coexist and have a cup of coffee together, don't support killing democracy in Canada.

1pquekv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1pquekv/just_started_wondering_about_spikes_in_hunger/,Just started. Wondering about spikes in hunger.,"I took my very first 2.5mg dose of Zepbound on Dec 7 and immediately started feeling the effects of a reduced appetite. Took my second dose of 2.5mg on Dec 14.

Yesterday afternoon, 4 days after my second shot, I got pretty hungry. Hungrier than I have been since I took the first shot. So, I ate two pieces of bread with deli meat and sliced cheese. Still felt hungry. My wife got home and made dinner and I ate half a bowl of a noodle dish she made. That seemed to fix the problem although I was still just a tiny bit hungry for the rest of the evening. I ignored it because I didn't want to overeat like I did week 1 and end up regretting it.

When I woke up this morning, I was absolutely starving. I thought I could fix this with a couple of cheese sticks and some coffee but that didn't work. Still quite hungry. Drank a protein shake, which in the first week would have shut off all hunger signals. Still hungry. Cooked 7 chicken nuggets in the air fryer and that finally turned off the hunger. All of that was before 10:30am.

My question is this, is it normal for hunger to break through and cause you to eat more than you normally would once in a while? I am not worried about anything, just kind of wondering if this is a normal thing that will happen from time to time. I guess I wonder if my body needed some extra nutrients and decided to up the hunger signals or something! I am already scheduled to increase my dose to 5mg on my next refill.

  
Edited to add, in my first week, I would not have been able to eat nearly as much as I did this morning. I would have had a very upset stomach. This morning I ate quite a bit more than I have since I started a couple of weeks ago and did not have any stomach issues at all. Just trying to figure all this out!

1pquall,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAKorean/comments/1pquall/korean_dating_perspective_needed_slow_pace_or/,Korean dating perspective needed: slow pace or just friendship?,"Hi everyone. I’m a non-Korean woman living in Korea, and I’m hoping to get some perspective from Koreans or people familiar with Korean dating culture. So sorry, this is kind of long.

I want to understand whether I may be misunderstanding a situation due to cultural differences, and whether my expectations or actions might have been unclear.

So I met a Korean man at the gym about four months ago. For the past three months, we’ve been spending a lot of time together regularly both at the gym and outside of it. He is calm, polite, thoughtful, and not very emotionally expressive. I’m also not very flirtatious by nature, which may add to the ambiguity.

We often work out together and he usually drives me home afterward. When we go out he often pays for dinner, and I usually pay for coffee. We’ve spent weekends hiking together and visiting museums. I have been to his home and he has been to mine as we made dinner for each other. Conversation is relaxed, joking, and unhurried. It doesn’t feel rushed or purely convenient.

He is the one who typically initiates plans. He doesn’t text constantly, but I am okay with that as I hate texting. I am currently traveling abroad briefly and he checked in and asked about my family. Even while I’m away, we’ve already talked about hanging out again when I return.

He asks personal questions about my life, including future plans and goals. He shares his own future plans related to school and career. He remembers details and follows up on things I’ve mentioned. One thing I’ve been wondering about, and I’m not sure if this is cultural or just my own concern, is that I’ve helped him a bit with English for school. He’s always been appreciative, and I don’t think he’s intentionally using me, but as I develop feelings I sometimes wonder whether he sees me more as a helpful, comfortable friend than as a potential romantic partner.

He has referred to me as “누나” in one situation and “friend” in another. He hasn’t used explicitly romantic language and nothing physical has happened other than playful teasing.

A couple of weeks ago I tried to gently ask where we stood, because I was feeling unsure.
He responded by saying that I’m a friend he feels  comfortable with and hopes we can continue spending time together and working out together. His response felt sincere and kind, but it also left me unsure how to interpret it culturally. I feel calm and comfortable when we’re together. Afterward, I feel unsure whether I’m misreading friendliness. I’m starting to develop feelings and want to be respectful and not pressure him.

My questions
1.	In Korean culture, does calling someone “누나” or “friend” usually mean the relationship is firmly non-romantic?
2.	Is it common for Korean men to spend this much one-on-one time without clear romantic intention?
3.	Could his response when I asked where we stood be a polite way of setting a boundary, or could it still leave room for something to develop later?
4.	From a Korean perspective, was it too early or inappropriate for me to ask about where we stood?
5.	If you were in my position, would you continue as things are, or assume this will likely remain a friendship?

I’m not trying to rush anything or push for a relationship. I just want to understand whether I’m interpreting this reasonably and how to respect Korean dating norms while also protecting my own feelings. Also we are both in our 30s.

Figured I'd share something more comprehensive about the actual FatFIRE experience.

The following is a llm edited voice dictation and then small adjustments by myself. Just a faster way to write and communicate. I kind of bounce around to different topics a bit too much. There is a large movement of people not wanting to consume AI generate content in any form, so I thought I would respect that.

**Background:** Low eight figures NW (high seven figures on volatile days). FatFIRED 3-4 years ago.

**The Adjustment Takes Longer Than You Think**

This is a massive lifestyle change, and honestly, it took about 18 months for it to fully sink in. When you realize that a comfortable middle-class life is essentially free for multiple lifetimes—that you can wake up and do literally whatever you want, go wherever you want, and the money appreciates faster than you can reasonably spend it—that's a wild mental adjustment.

I went through a pretty hedonistic phase early on. Lots of traveling, women, food, experiencing everything. But eventually, you start figuring out what actually matters.

**The Material Stuff Plateau**

I see a lot of posts here focused on material possessions: the big beautiful home, cars, watches—essentially things that communicate status. And look, those things are nice. I've done them. But here's the thing: at this level, most things are essentially free. You can have them if you want them (assuming you don't lose control of spending).

But after that 18-month mark, you really start getting a sense of life's true value and what actually makes you happy.

**What I've Prioritized Instead**

**Purpose:** I love building things. I had a career working with amazing people, collaborating, creating. So I funded a startup with a $1M budget—if it fails, it fails, and I shouldn't be doing it anyway. But I'm building something, learning, working with incredible people. I have purpose. I'm building something I believe in over pure profit. I'm being true to myself. I can't just travel, eat, and fuck around indefinitely (as much as I enjoy those things). There's no purpose to it.

**Health:** This gets massively prioritized. Personal trainer, gym twice a day, proper nutrition. I want to enjoy this life for as long as possible, and now I have the time to make health non-negotiable.

**Time Optimization:** This is where I've spent the best money:

* **Private chef:** Hands down the best decision. Meal prep, healthy eating, zero time wasted on food decisions or prep.
* **Driver relationship:** Not Uber—a reliable driver I can call anytime. I live near a major airport hub because I love to travel, and I want to get anywhere in the world with minimal friction.
* **Personal assistant (as needed):** Not full-time staff, but healthy business relationships with people I employ when needed. Example: ""Set up my office, mid-century modern aesthetic""—and they handle all the searching, purchasing, and execution. I stick to vision; they handle implementation.

**The Most Important Discovery: Community**

This is the big one. I moved close to my friends of 20+ years (several are also FIRE'd). If I want to have coffee, bake them a cake, or just hang out, we make it happen. Having a community of people I genuinely love and have loved for decades is hands down the best money I've ever spent. **It is hard to describe how awesome this is.**

**The Bottom Line**

Things that get your time back, prioritize your health, and build community are infinitely more valuable than material bullshit. Fancy trips and fancy dinners are worthless unless they're shared.

I hope this encourages those of you considering pulling the trigger or figuring out post-FIRE life. Of course, everyone's journey is different, and I respect that. Happy to answer questions.",13,1766173092.0,fatFIRE,16,0.68,False

It’s been 7 weeks since the breakup (No Contact from my side), but her behavior is contradictory and I’d appreciate some insight.

​1. The Relationship about 3.5 weeks
We met on Tinder. It was the best first date I've had in a year, instant chemistry, we felt super comfortable and loose, with each other, we danced, we kissed.

​The Pattern: On the second date (her birthday), I bought her sweets and flowers because I 3 days I had to cancel.
It was intense, we were at her house, made love half the night. But the next day evening she panicked. She said she was afraid because we had ""too much chemistry"" and she thought getting attached this early wasn't good without a label. She wanted space.

​ She invited me to her birthday party, but then uninvited me saying it was ""too soon.""

​Next date she proposed just a 2-hour coffee because she was busy, it had to happen after 1 week. On the date I didn't even try to hug her, but she hugged me. Long story short, we ended up staying 4 hours and went back to her place for amazing intimacy. Again, we were both late for things the next day.

​She is a freelancer and doing a Master’s. She works everyday. She failed something at work/uni and got scared again. She was affectionate after the second date, telling me that I give her motivation to work etc, but then ignored me for days. Finally, she sent a breakup text blaming me for her failures (said she missed income because of me, the gift was too expensive, I ""forced"" her to meet on her birthday).
​I didn't argue because it felt irrational. 

I just send several messages, I got a little but angry as it was a suprise, out of nowhere. I am not going to write her as she said her decision is final, and I have too much self respect after she disrespected me. However after 3 weeks I started missing her again. Then weird things statted to happen. They didn't happen with any of the women I dated before, this is wierd. I am not sure if my brain is messing with me.

​2. The ""Weird Things"" during
It has been 7 weeks now when we haven't spoken.

 This the series of weird things that mess with me.

Location Thing (Week 3-4): I started checking her Tinder profile when I missed her, to look at the pictures. I noticed her location was updating from a mall/free coworking space less than 1km from my home for several days weeknd + 2 working days. She lives far away and never mentioned working there before. She knows I live right next to that mall. This could be a coincidance, she could have been there doing shopping for 2 hours and opened the app, whatever.


​A Facebook Post (Week 4-5): I don't use FB much, but she popped up in ""People You May Know."" I wasn't sure it wss her profile as there was a wierd angle in the profile picture, different hair color and she gave me the english translation of her name, so I didn't click on the profile for several weeks. But then got curious if it was her. Yes, she had some other pictures, it was her, but compeltely different name and surname.

When I clicked on it and saw a post she made 2 weeks after the breakup. It was about ""hobbies and compatibility."" She specifically listed my main hobby (Gym) as the first example—something she was insecure about during our dates (she lied about going to the gym on date 1, then called her out and she said she was joking). It felt weirdly specific to me. But it could be a coincidance.

​The Name Change (Week 5): She didn't have her ""English translated name"" on her profile before. Around week 5, she added this specific English nickname (which she used with me) next to her real name. This is how I confirmed it was definitely her profile.

​The Library Encounter (Week 6): I went to a public library to work (pure coincidence, I didn't know she went there). I ran into her on the first floor. She looked shocked and then visibly angry to see me.
This means there is some emotion, she was not neutral.

​My Question:
I am new to this attachment style thing. I just found about it after 1.5 years of dating as this woman was weird and she fits the pattern. I understand they can obsess over someone from a distance, literally researched that this week.

This is weird but is there a possibility she is not over me, but is afraid to reach out? Like is there a possibility she was working at that mall for several days? The facebook, think and her adding her english name? Is this possible? Or is my brain messing with me? 

I am pretty sure the breakup was weird and she will at some point come back with an apology, as it was not a logical behaviour.

I am nit sure what to think about this.

I am thinking of swallowing my pride and reaching out to her.",0,1766173024.0,Disorganized_Attach,0,0.5,False

He’s had his system for a year, totally happy with the daily production he sees on the app, but then this bill hits.

I tried to walk him through it. I started explaining the difference between generation credits and delivery fees. I got into non-bypassable charges. I even tried to explain how his specific Time-of-Use plan devalued his export during the day.

He listened for about five minutes, took a sip of coffee, and asked: ""So I generated the power, sent it to them, and they're charging me to send it back?""

I realized halfway through my explanation that I sounded like I was defending the utility company, which is the last thing I want to do.

It’s wild how much of a disconnect there is in this industry. You have the engineering reality (physics, azimuth, grid load) and then you have the bureaucratic reality (rate schedules, NEM policies). To a normal homeowner who just wants to ""pay less,"" the bureaucratic part feels indistinguishable from a scam.

Even having worked in ops and dealt with this stuff for years, I still get a headache trying to audit some of these rate structures. It feels like the complexity is the point.

How do you guys handle explaining the math to friends or family without their eyes glazing over?

1pqu5wk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pqu5wk/aita_for_using_the_wheelchair_accessible_toilet/,AITA for using the wheelchair accessible toilet,"To preface: I am aware that I am technically wrong for using the wheelchair accessible toilet; but I would like to know if IATA. Also, this is not US.

So I have a 6month old baby. He is doing great, sleeps ok at night (starting solids is sometimes disturbing sleep), growing like he should and also daytime naps are doing very good. We manage to get him to sleep relatively easily for his first two naps but the last one is more difficult, so if I have errands to run I usually do it around his final nap as he sleeps okish in his stroller. So today I had to go into town, to go the library to return some books, which is about 2km, and in planned to get a coffee and then go to the library and take a longer detour so bub could sleep on the way home. After my coffee I quickly went into a large department store to pick up a Christmas present and I decided I have to go the toilet, waiting until I get home would be uncomfortable. When I am at this department store and I have to go to the toilet (when it’s just us) I always use the wheelchair accessible toilet. I can just take the stroller inside. As I mentioned, I know I technically shouldn’t, but what would I do with my baby if I wouldn’t? 

Anyway, when I came out, a woman started complaining I was not allowed and called me rude. To be clear; she was not a wheelchair user, she was not accompanied by a wheelchair user, there was no wheelchair user waiting to use the toilet. There also was not a line for the regular toilets and maybe she was upset I skipped the line. Nothing. I asked her how can I use the toilet? She told me to leave the stroller outside while I pee…  I mean, for sake of argument: it’s a small toilet with just 4 stalls (there are multiple in the store) and the stroller would block 2 and the sink so that would be inconvenient. Although this argument is useless as I would NEVER even consider leaving my baby outside the toilet when I pee? Like who does that?  Of course if my partner is there, or someone else is with me I leave baby with them when I pee. Anyway; she called me rude. 

AITA?

I make my husband breakfast and only him because when I made father in law breakfast yesterday, he made me cry by immediately saying a rude stuff about what I had made and not a single thank you.

​Hey everyone! I’ve been tracking the grind recommendations on my Ninja Luxe Cafe for the brewed coffee side, and it seems the machine isn't ""learning""—it’s just using a fixed math formula.

​On my machine, these numbers are CONSTANT for Strength settings 1 and 2:
​For 6–8 oz size:
​Classic: 23 | Rich: 22 | Over Ice: 22 | Cold Brew: 21

​For 10–18 oz size:
​Classic: 24 | Rich: 23 | Over Ice: 23 | Cold Brew: 22

​The ONLY time it changes: If I bump the strength up to Strength 3, the machine automatically tells me to go 1 step finer on everything (except Cold Brew, which stays the same).

​My questions for you:
​Are you guys seeing these same ""frozen"" numbers on your machines?

​Has yours ever recommended a different number based on the actual beans, or does it only change when you toggle the Strength button?

​Are you manually deviating from these (like grinding at 18 or 20) to get a better cup, or just sticking with the presets?
​It feels like the ""Assist"" logic is great for Espresso, but for the coffee side, it’s just a pre-programmed table. Curious if anyone has seen their machine actually ""learn"" for drip coffee!",1,1766172627.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,7,1.0,False

1pqtwg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pqtwg4/aita_for_ruining_my_sisters_engagement/,"AITA for ruining my sister's ""engagement?""","I didn't take my sister's engagement seriously enough for her and now she's banned me from her life. AITA? My sister (31F) has always marched to her own beat. She's significantly younger than me and I've always considered myself more a father figure than a sibling.

Depending on the person I have two ways of describing her: 1) is like a tornado. You never know if she's going to blow into your town and ruffle up a little dust storm of chaos, but leave with everything relatively unscathed or whether she's going to decimate your entire life. 2) She's a bit like a cat that likes to push the water glass to the edge of the table while staring you down the entire time checking your response. Only, in this case, the water glass metaphor is your love, respect, admiration, and most importantly your trust of her. She'll push that ""glass"" to the floor then look at you shocked that you're upset that your ""glass"" is broken, your floor ruined, and your sentimental item broken beyond repair. Does that make sense? 

She's a classic (grandiose) narcissist. She's unfortunately never been diagnosed, but after extensive therapy, my therapist has given a hesitant-though-assured nod of approval on what I've been thinking all along. 

  
I'm no picnic either. I have wild adult ADHD, am fairly well along the autism spectrum, am a perfectionist, and due to a mix of the above am fairly quick to set rules for ""normal societal living"" that bother me when they are crossed by others. Fine, we all have our things.

My sister doesn't come back to visit much. We don't have proper housing for her to stay in if she returns. That's a long story in that my house is very old and in constant renovation and our mother doesn't have the ability to house her in the home she grew up in currently. She always travels with her current boyfriend and always with her very large and rambunctious dogs. She is insistent they are emotional support animals or at least her internet documents say that they are.

However she did return for Thanksgiving this year. There is always tension with a visit because of the tornado and cat scenarios above. One never really knows when the next explosion will occur. Our family walks on egg shells around her. The last half a dozen visits have been fairly flawless, so a storm is brewing. But we welcomed her whole-heartedly, as always, but still couldn't host her. 

My philosophy has always been if I can't afford a trip, including trips for holidays, I can't go on that trip. But that isn't a thought process that she agrees with. She sets her mind to something and regardless of money somehow finds a way to come. 

The day of arrival she alerts our mother, for the first time, that she didn't have money to rent a car so she'd need a ride from the airport at 9pm (it's 2 hours away) and she'd be with her boyfriend and two large dogs. That also meant she'd need mother's car for the entire week she was back. Our mom lives out in the rural country, so without a car she is stranded. Mom obliges and all is well. The dogs are hungry so they must be taken to a restaurant after the flight and fed mozzarella sticks though. Then a high wind, two hour drive back to our rural town.

A day or two go by and she is making Thanksgiving for her father (we have different dads). She needs dozens of borrowed items from me, mother, and others. She has the car the whole time at her airbnb. Our Thanksgiving comes and she's late as mom needed to pick up several family members after getting her car back for the afternoon. She's upset she's late. She criticizes family members calling one homeless-looking, and judging others for what they are wearing. Two family members had to leave the main dining area to take a break from her, regretfully telling me that's why they were hiding in the kitchen. It's common though, so not a major surprise.

The engagement part is coming, I promise. 

She then launches into a tirade about how our mom isn't able to take care of herself anymore and that I was enabling her to live in squalor. This is not the case. She's newly retired and needs some time to adjust. She criticizes the fatty American Thanksgiving food our family has brought, criticizes an aunt's face (that it needs botox), and basically two hours of complaints. I try to temper it as she's saying this in front of her boyfriend, amongst other family members. I don't want her to seem so out there, but it's not working.

Meanwhile, I've been sick for over a month with one of those upper respiratory bugs going around. I can't shake it and the holidays and my work made it significantly worse to the point where I isolated myself most of the day away from folks because I couldn't stop coughing, though definitely not contagious. She decides our smaller family unit will all go to a nearby small town holiday bazaar the following day. We are all tired, but we want to spend time with her. I am beyond sick and say I may not be able to go to which she responds, ""Suck it up. You should want to see your sister. You don't seem sick anyway. Why are you being like this when I'm here to visit?"" I wrote it down because I found it insensitive and I wanted to keep that wording exactly how she said it. She has to run to the gym before we leave the next day, but we plan to meet at 11am.

I do indeed suck it up the next day and get ready for the day of fun. There is a flow to this town event. A town of about 100 people gets filled with about 20,000 people in one day for this holiday extravaganza. There are only two restaurants for all those people, and the shopping is so overwhelming and crowded. So there is a bit of a nuance to how you need to navigate that day without just waiting in line all day long. So I make a mental plan.

We show up at 11:01 as she hates being late, but life does get in the way. I'm worried she'll be upset we are late, so I offer to grab coffees. No response for 15-20 minutes. I finally get a text back after grabbing coffees for mom, my partner, and me. She's at a local jewelry story in our hometown. Oh! I thought she was at the gym? We go in, it's way overcrowded (Black Friday). She's in full hair and makeup and dressed up. Wait? So no gym? How'd she get to the gym if mom has her car again?

Lots of thoughts swirling. As I approach she's down on one knee holding boyfriend's hand like a proposal. Odd, but not out of character. We get closer and she off-handedly turns her head back to say, ""oh hold on we're just getting engaged. We aren't quite ready to leave."" We all look at each other. Mom, my partner, me, and some other customers. It was so casually said we weren't sure we heard right. So we wait for them to finish up and by this point it's 11:45. Now my plan is sort of shot. I offer to go celebrate their ""engagement?"" at brunch instead of going to this holiday bazaar half an hour away. No, she wants to go to the bazaar. We had our two cars ready to go as there were five of us and neither car holds more than four. Well now boyfriend, fiance?, isn't going. So we pile into one car and get ready to go. Before leaving my mom hollers to the fiance? ""Congratulations...NAME."" And he tosses back over his shoulder, ""oh I haven't asked her yet."" More looks all around. 

The road up there is one long monologue from the backseat at full volume. I've never heard someone talk so loudly, so I do ask her to quiet it down a little as she's right behind me. That didn't go well. It got louder, but I was interested in the story. We arrive. The town is absolutely jam packed. Cars and people are clogging the literal dirt streets. So we go to these bargain stores...like Amazon returns, etc. You can usually find something interesting. We do this to avoid the downtown until the morning folk leave. We plan on a very late lunch around 3 once those folks are gone. Ten minutes into this sister decides she is absolutely the most starved she's ever been in her life (her words) and that she is disappointed no one bought her a coffee. Perhaps she didn't get my text offer of coffee? I said, ""you didn't eat before or after the gym?"" ""Oh we didn't go to the gym, why do you ask?"" ""Well that's why we decided to leave at 11 because you had to go to the gym first? Otherwise we should have left at 730am to avoid crowds."" ""Oh well, too late now.""

So we wrap up and head toward food right at 12:45pm on a busy holiday Black Friday weekend. Each restaurant holds maybe 50 people, so I expect we'll wait an hour or more. We do manage to squeeze in after about a half hour. She's pacing due to being hungry and needing a restroom. None of us are hungry, but it's food time, so we plan to eat. 

It's at this point where things take the turn. After we sit to eat the restaurant is judged by sister. The limited holiday menu is dissected by her and she questions all the items to the waitress who is clearly slammed and not interested in chit chat. So that starts a downhill ball of rage? from sister. She tries to get back on track discussing the sizing of her ring. It's important to note that I got engaged exactly one month earlier to this for the first time in my four decade life. One month to the day. It's also important to note that I worked at a jewelry store for twenty years. But I sold, I didn't work on jewelry. I become the jewelry expert and am happy to be asked. But a tricky point comes up with her estate engagement ring in that she is going to have two wedding bands put on. But she will wear the engagement ring alone for at least one year. So what does she size it to? 

If you know jewelry it might be more nuanced, but should she go 6? 6.25? 6.5? She has bigger knuckles and smaller fingers, so if it goes past the knuckle will it spin on her finger, etc. I try to answer. But one thing I know...if I tell her  and she has to size up with the bands, it will be my fault she has to spend money. If I tell her 6.5 and it's too loose and falls off before she gets her bands to hold it in place, it will be my fault she lost her engagement ring. I beg her to ask a professional and that my recommendation is to get a 6.25 knowing it will need sized with the bands later. I say this over and over and over again. ""Ask a professional. I wouldn't know without seeing them, but I'd recommend a 6.25 personally.""  

A flip is switched and she begins projectile crying. Tears are literally falling off her face in a matter of seconds. She screams, ""You are so f#\*%ing condescending"" and slams the table. She is sobbing uncontrollably now and shouting across the small dining room that I can't even have a simple conversation with her without making her feel small. Then she tells me I've ruined her engagement. I respond, probably incorrectly, with, ""but he said he didn't ask yet. I thought this was just buying the rings and once he proposed there would be a whole to do."" I also reminded that I borderline begged to not come to this other town, but rather to stay in our hometown and go have brunch to celebrate instead. 

At this point I ask her if we can go outside to talk or to discuss after lunch when people aren't around. She tells me I don't get to decide this and if I had something to say I should go first. So I start talking, listing my understanding of what has happened since I was told to suck it up last night to her screaming at me and she slams the table again and screams (I truly mean scream. Everyone in the restaurant is watching), ""I am not going to have this conversation with you!"" I reminded her I am the one that didn't want the conversation now and she insisted we talk now. She called me a condescending liar. The food arrived mid sentence of her speaking which seemed to really upset her further. So we sorted food to each person and the waitress, oblivious sees her crying and we shake our head like ""please don't get involved for your own safety.""

Sister sees us shaking our heads no and runs outside leaving her phone and some other things at the table. She runs into several patrons on the way out and is loudly sobbing. We three sit stunned and unsure what to do. Several patrons ask if she's okay and we don't know. Mom offers to go outside but is crying too hard at her daughter's upset so I offer to go out to apologize. 

I bring her phone and belongings and tell her I'm happy to go eat in the car if she'd like to go back inside to finish her salad. It's clear she's upset and if I need to remove myself I will. I don't hear a response so I offer to box her food up so she can be alone in the car since she's still crying. She starts walking off. She's leaving us in a town of 100 people, half an hour from our hometown to go somewhere unknown. I beg her to stay and then it really begins.

She is in the street screaming at the top of her lungs. She calls me every name in the book. If you've heard it she said it. I ask her to leave the street and move to the side of the building. She eventually obliges because she realizes a small child is waiting for a table with his family and they are hearing all the cursing. We move to the side and she unleashes the shocker:

SHE calls ME a narcissist. She says I'm a sociopath because if ""you are upset about this as I am you'd be crying like THIS!"" Therein she points at her eye and on cue a tear shoots out of her eye. I keep repeating that I'm not sure why she's upset but I'd like to know and I'm sorry that she's upset when it's supposed to be her special day. I am asking clarifying questions about whether she's upset about the ring sizing or what her boyfriend said about not asking yet or that she's just hungry, etc. She is hypoglycemic and this could potentially be related. I offer to get her food wrapped up or for me to leave for awhile so she can eat because I'm worried she needs food. She calls me a narcissist and sociopath again and says that I lack any empathy.  I'm still trying to suss out what is at the heart of the upset, but it's starting to seem 100% performative. 

After being called a narcissist for the third time, I basically lost control of my whole body and I bent in half at the waist like I was about to do a toe-touch. I'm not sure how or why my body did that. But it resulted in a fully uncontrollable loud scream laugh that came out of me. I laughed like an ""insane"" person might and when I stood upright again and stopped laughing I did yell, ""well you are a flagrant C#%T."" That sort of stopped her, for a bit, in her tracks. I was very calm when I finally told her that she needed to look in a mirror before she started handing out diagnoses and that she was the narcissist. I went on that until she began to understand that she would see this in other people because it's something she knows she is doing purposefully and if she sees it in others she thinks they are the narcissists. 

Twenty years of therapy and self reflection has helped me separate my actions of trauma response to her actions of agressor and victim. I have kept her at arms-length for her entire life because she is so quick to harm others with her actions and words.

I tell her I'm going to go eat dinner with my family and she can basically get lost. It's at this point that she tells me she's made the difficult decision to end our sibling relationship and that she would never speak to me again under any circumstance. She let me know, just to clarify, that that included her grad school graduation, her eventual wedding, and that I would no longer be invited to meet her future children. I told her I thought that was for the best.

If you know narcissists you know that if you take them out of their ""script"" of desired conversation it derails their thought process typically freezing them in quickly scanning their new target of annihilation. I presume she wanted me to beg to keep our relationship? But after years of therapy that (full no contact) had been the consensus of what I should do with her, but due to my mother's deeply empathetic compassion to keep our family as strong as possible I had steered away from grey rock or black rock-ing sister as a person. 

So I said again that I was going to go inside to eat with my family. Then she loudly (there is a crowd outside again) reignites her tears and shouts ""no I am going to go eat Christmas dinner with my family."" To which I reply, ""it's the day after Thanksgiving you stupid B!+\*h."" Then I grabbed my chicken tenders (don't judge, it truly was a limited menu) with my bare hands and head out to my car.

It's at this point that her tears come back in full supply and she starts unloading on my mom and partner who are quietly eating their food in silence while she spills her version of the events, most notably saying I called HER ""a flagrant narcissist."" She says I ruined the most important day of her life so far, her engagement day, by taking her to a moldy old shed to look at gross online returns instead of celebrating her day. She added that when she tried to include me I shut her down and wouldn't help with the ring details. She claims I was rude to her the days leading up to and at Thanksgiving by not giving her all the pots and pans she needed and that I kept trying to weasel out of the holiday bazaar by pretending to be sick. I was barely able to get out of bed that morning and on Thanksgiving. She decides she will call her boyfriend/fiance and have him meet up with her father (not my father) and have boyfriend/fiance come get her so she doesn't have to stay with me or ride in the car because she ""didn't feel safe"" near me. 

Wait...did I forget to mention that during our entire outdoor heated debate she was full-body BUCKING at me? She was bucking like she was the star at a cockfight, or like a really wild street fight. She's in full glam and fully dolled up with a curled ponytail BUCKING at me like a rabid dog. NO, sadly I am not exaggerating. I didn't feel unsafe, but her behavior was erratic. I once put my arm up, as she almost hit my nose with my chin while bucking at me, to remind her to keep her distance from me as she was way too close, but there was never threat of violence or anything like that. So I'm not sure why she felt unsafe. If it's not clear, I'm homosexual, also, so I like to think less of a threat to society?

So she calls boyfriend/fiance, he comes to get her. Mom is crying the rest of the day. My partner is so baffled as this is the first time he's seen Sybil (like the Sally Field movie), although he had heard several stories. I don't think he believed us until he saw some of this in person. Boyfriend responds to my mom that she's safely picked up. Mom apologizes to him. He responds, ""I have two brothers, so I get sibling rivalry."" What the heck does that mean? There's no rivalry that I know of?

And that's the last we've spoken to one another for about a month. There is something freeing about leaving her be and not worrying about her revolving my life to fit her orbit structure. 

But I truly wonder, AITAH? I believe every conversation and word is accounted for. I believe every interaction is mentioned without bias except my self-reflection on it. Did I ruin her engagement? As far as I know, a month later, she's still not engaged and she won't be until Christmas as he allegedly hasn't asked her yet. It seems to me that there were years of resentment on her part, and years of trauma on my part that forced me to keep her at a distance. And these seemed to culminate starting with my engagement the month before and then they really came true when I wouldn't gush over the engagement because it was a ring purchase not an engagement, as confirmed by her boyfriend. 

She has grey-rocked her father for almost 15 years. She is full no contact with her other half brother and this is the sixth of her boyfriend's I've met, each one nearing engagement and then they are never heard of again. Her last boyfriend was overheard on her Ring cam ""dissing her"" to his family and that ended a two year relationship. 

At the end of the day I hope she gets help, but I know she never will. My therapist is proud of me, but my heart tells me I should do anything to save our small family unit.

1pqtu0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pqtu0f/the_bayou_baptist/,The Bayou Baptist,"Part 1 	Help, my best friend Beau has been missing for over three weeks now. Local law enforcement has not been able to locate him… or his body. Three weeks ago Pastor Beau was giving a fill-in sermon at a church here in Louisiana; only an hour and a half outside of New Orleans where we live. Terrebonne Parish Officers first arrived on scene Tuesday morning a couple of days after Beau didn’t return home; his truck was still parked at the church. The only belongings of Beau’s were found in and outside his blue Ford; his Bible bag, now broken cross necklace, left shoe, shattered phone and, his Bible. When officers arrived on scene that humid morning, Beau’s driver side door was left fully open. His Bible lay open on the driver seat, torn to shreds; pages torn out and circled scripture. The chapters and verses that were circled were as follows. Genesis 22, Judges 11-12, Exodus 24, Matthew 8: 28-34. Parish police were not able to make a clear image or connection of the scripture to figure out where he went nor a motive for anyone to harm the good pastor. Personally as a skeptic myself, I have no idea what these passages have to do with Beau. According to Beau’s mom, Nancy, the police have told her that unfortunately the case has gone cold. I plan on taking a drive down there this week to see what I can piece together.

Part 2		I finally made it to the city Beau went missing in.  I first stopped at the church to speak with the main pastor and deacons of the congregation. Pastor Fred was out with a family emergency that week; so Joel, a deacon of the church, had reached out to Beau to see if he’d fill in. Pastor Fred so graciously gave me Joel’s cell number so I was able to call and talk with him; we had an agreement on a meeting spot. Joel suggested a small restaurant on the outskirts of town next to Dr. Weller's Blood Bank. According to Joel, “Beau and I were doing a public outreach; we would spend time praying and loving on the drug dealers, criminals, prostitutes and strippers in the area. Joel and Beau were supposed to meet at Shelly’s Men's Club in Houma Tuesday night to speak with a stripper named Sierra; they'd already spoken and prayed for her a few times before”. I asked Joel if Sierra could have a possible connection on Beau’s disappearance; he assured me that she couldn't hurt a fly. She definitely could be a person I need to seek out for more information, I asked Joel if he knew of the connections for the scripture. Joel was taken aback by what had happened to Beau’s Bible; however, he informed me that “ Genesis 22 and Judges 11-12 both contain human sacrifices”. He got noticeably nervous when he brought up what Exodus 24 talks about; “blood rituals, normally centered around the concept of atonement and covenant in the old testament”. Given the circumstances of the disappearance, the people Beau and now Joel both reached out to, his once cool and collected demeanor completely evaporated as Joel went on to speak about Matthew 8: 28-34. “Now, in those verses Jesus encountered two demon-possed men. The demons begged Jesus if you can cast us out, send us into that herd of pigs. Jesus commanded the Demons to flee the men and the demons entered the swine before the entire herd plunged down a hillside into a lake”. Joel’s hand shook ever so slightly as he placed his coffee mug back down onto the table top, I looked into his eyes searching for more information before asking him. “What possible connections do you think these have to do with Beau’s disappearance”? Joel replied rather quietly “Other than being verses and stories from the Bible, I have no clue Eric”. With that, he got up and left the restaurant. I left shortly after him, with a new destination in mind: Shelly’s Men's Club in Houma. Given that it is a Friday night, usually the busier nights for clubs like this, I hope Sierra is working. My GPS had me turn onto Meadowland Dr and park my car after the thirty minute drive there; luckily an hour after opening. I walk into this small, podunk club with one thing in mind; tracking down Sierra. This club was nothing like I was used to seeing after spending years in NOLA. The small stage and small private booths can be seen from the bar. The barkeep, a woman who looked to be around her 40s with black hair and a skimpy outfit named Tiffany, asked me in a somewhat sultry voice, “What can I get you to drink, sweetie?” I smiled politely back at her, simply telling her “I would like a Busch Light.  I am actually looking for Sierra, is she in tonight?” Tiffany said that “Sierra is working tonight and in the back changing, do you want a private session with her?” I nod my head and hand her a $5 bill for the beer I ordered before taking the beverage and informing Tiffany where I am sitting for Sierra to find me. As I sit in the back half of the room, nursing my beer, watching the girls do their dances up and down the poles waiting for Sierra, I notice a woman walk out of the changing rooms. Her blonde hair was flowing back in the breeze of her strides; some strands tangling on her pink lingerie as her voluptuous breasts jiggle with each step she takes in her bright pink heels to the bar. Tiffany hastily points Sierra in my direction, sharing some silent words before Sierra closes the distance quickly and she sits on my lap. The aroma of roses caressed my nose like a gentle breeze. “Hello handsome”, she says in a sultry voice; her back to me. She then swings her legs around to the right, putting her legs over mine; resting half of her exposed cheeks on a part of my thighs. “If you are wanting a private session honey, it is $15 clothed and $20 naked, unless you want a little something more”. Her eyes finally made contact with mine. Her eyes looked hopelessly black, soulless, like all of the love, hope and joy was violently sucked out of them. It wasn’t until she caressed my cheek that I realized she was speaking to me, “Did you want to do the $20 dance honey?”. I cleared my throat and firmly let her know I was actually here looking for Beau. She shot daggers at me from her side eye, before slowly sitting in the chair to my left. “I already told the Parrish police everything I know about his disappearance. What more information do you people need?” I took a big drink of my beer, before gently putting the bottle back down onto the table. “Sierra, I am not law enforcement. I am simply looking for my childhood best friend, we grew up together. Nothing about this case has added up for me since it happened. Do you have any possible clue where he could have gone?” I take another swig from the cold bottle, “Joel and Beau were supposed to meet you here the Tuesday night after he went missing. Are you aware of any other people he was having these meetings with?” I refrained from any further eye contact with her, as I finished my bottle. Sierra smiled as she watched me drink every last drop, before saying. “I do not know who Beau was meeting with next, but, he had a circle of people he was currently praying over and listening to.” I smile softly, “that’s great! Do you happen to remember some of the names or places he would meet them?” She looked at me, watching me intently before saying, “I don’t know all of the places but the last time I had seen Beau, Joel was mentioning their plans to meet a man named Micah, a known heroin and cocaine dealer behind the Dollar General here in town on Thursday night. Other than Micah, they had mentioned a Henry. I believe he is a cult member of some type”. Henry and Micah, Micah sounds like an easier target to track down than Hank. “Thank you! Do you have a number for either one of those guys?” She quickly says “Yes I do have some other contacts connected to these guys. If you follow me into the back, private room, I can give you some other personal information on these men.” With a firm grasp on my left hand, she guided me into the employees only entrance off the stage floor. I got up and started to follow her guidance, my knees feeling weaker and weaker by the minute. My vision began to blur, the lights in the club dancing across my dilated corneas. The once upbeat, overly loud music, sounded like I was underwater. Before I knew it, she was gently pushing me from the back into the employee entrance; slamming the door shut behind her as she walked in. The room was spinning as everything began to fade to black;  getting one last look at her, as she snears before hushly saying “you’ll never find him.”

Part 3 		As I am unzipping my Bible bag to gently put my Bible neatly inside, Joel claps my shoulder to get my attention. “Great service tonight Beau, thank you again for doing this for our congregation! Pastor Fred and I are very blessed to have you. Are you still available for dinner tomorrow night?” I turn and look at Joel before smiling, “Thank you, it’s no problem at all, we are called to serve God. I cannot deny my calling, of course I am still open for dinner tomorrow. Where was it again?” “Tumabo! Just off of LA-56, across the Bayou Petit Gaillou.” We shake hands, as I say “Sounds good, I will see you tomorrow night at 7pm for dinner with Pastor Fred!” slinging my Bible bag around my left shoulder. I followed Joel to the front door of the church. I saw from the reflection in the glass doors, as his tail lights turned onto the main road as I tried to open the doors, making sure to lock up for the night. As I begin my slowly walk to my truck, my nose is violently assaulted by the smell of death and decay; almost as if I were down wind from the local slaughter house, except that's impossible. There isn’t a slaughter house in this city, so I quickly unlocked my truck. The head light beams piercing into the dark curtain of the night, as I climb into the driver's seat. Placing my Bible bag onto the passenger seat, I look up after cranking the engine to life. There was a man, standing in between the beams; he had a severed goat’s head over his head. The blood of the goat was free-bleeding down his shirt and pants. The eye sockets had been gouged out, revealing the piercing blue eyes of the man behind the mask. I quickly cut off the engine, opened my door and stepped out of the truck; remaining behind the door. I shout with everything I muster, voice trembling “What do you want!?”. The man cocks his head to the left, staring at me with what seems like childlike wonder, I bark again. “Leave now in the name of Jesu-” my sentence being cut off as my mouth and nose were covered by a rag, as two more men wearing goat heads scoop me up from behind. I instantly tried to thrash around like a gator who caught prey. Kicking, elbowing, punching as they wrestled me to the ground. My left foot getting caught in my running boards as I thrashed. Completely ripping off my loafer and dislocating my ankle in the process. Feeling the loud pop and agony shortly thereafter. The sound of their voices muffled and got quieter as I began to lose consciousness.

Part 4		As I attempt to sit up, gasping for air, finally coming to, my drug-fueled dream is still fresh in the forefront of my mind. I slowly begin to look around the silent rundown motel room where I awoke, noticing the cobwebs that formed on the lampshade, connecting to the stained nightstand next to the bed. The cross above the door had been turned upside down, the mirror broken and the least of these. There was a giant hole surrounded by mold where the ceiling fan used to hang.  As if being in this decrepit room wasn’t bad enough, my hands and feet are tied down to the sides of the bed.  I slowly glanced around the room for something or anything to get me out of my restraints. The silence was loudly interrupted by the sounds of someone running full speed in the direction of the door, before the loud groan the old doors hinges let out as it slowly opened. Sierra was slowly crawling on all fours into the room, before crawling up the walls and onto the ceiling; her empty hungry eyes never leaving me. “Wh… what the hell is this!? What do you want from me!?” I pleaded while being frozen in terror, Sierra gleefully smiles while slowly and gracefully getting herself off the ceiling. “What do I want?? Oh sweetie, it's not what I want. It’s what I need, your blood. Every last savory drop, can’t possibly finish the ritual without it. Especially knowing what kind of man you are. Glutton, lustful, prideful, rageful. Going off half cocked with no plan, no friends and nobody to save you is exactly what brought you to me.” I began to silently sob and cry out realizing there was no way out, before a still small voice reminded me what Beau was attempting to say before he was cut off. “Leave now in the name of Jesus Christ” as those words came to me, my arm hair started to stand up on end. I began to cry out to Jesus, “Jesus please help me lord, I am a weak and feeble man; without you, your amor and protection I am nothing. With you Lord, I can do all things; please Lord I need your help and guidance! God please save me, I need you now!” The room slowly began to tremble, the already broken mirror fell off the wall shattering into many pieces. Sierra grimaced while barking “You really think he is going to save you!? He couldn’t even save Beau!” As I looked back at her, into her eyes I realized, nothing but darkness in them. No color, no life, just an empty black pit. I shouted with every ounce in me “Leave now in the name of the King of Kings, Lord of Lords, Jesus Christ, Yahweh!” As the ceiling began to crack and crumble, I felt this strange calm peace set over me. Sierra's head started to violently and rapidly shake, side to side at a fast rate of speed. Her face and body slowly shifted into a gray, decaying mess; her once blue painted nails became long sharp talons. Her lips tightly shrunken against her maw of razor sharp blood covered teeth “I said leave now in the name of Jesus Christ!” Parts of the ceiling gave way, crashing to the floor as the once upside down cross, fixed itself right side up; my shackles breaking off my appendages freeing me. Sierra immediately turned, and sprinted out of the room; her hollering and hooting slowly growing fainter before leaving me in the silence once more.

Part 5			While I am slowly but surely making my way back to the club to get my car. Walking down these empty yet brightly lit streets, the crackle of thunder and flashes of lighting began to fill the night sky. The sounds of this biblical deluge muffling the sounds of crickets, mosquitoes and  cicadas buzzing. Throwing my hood over my head, I pulled out my phone to call Joel, hoping he could point me in the direction of Henry. The line rang three times before Joel answered with a gruff but yet angry tone. “Do not call me again, Boy.” before he ended the call. Struggling to quickly shove my phone back into my pockets to keep it dry, I accidently shoulder checked a man walking past. “I am so sorry” I began to start apologizing before he cut me off. “Eric, right? You’re Pastor Beau’s friend.” I looked at him quizzically while slowly nodding. “ Great, I have a message for you. You need to keep away from Joel and that congregation, do not under any circumstances go back and look for Sierra. Her real name is Eve, Sierra is her stage name. Micah is currently in Terrebonne Parish Jail, Henry’s here in Houma further north past the club here on 316. Look for Canal Lane and take it all the way down to the trailer on the left. He will know what to do. Before he departs, he smiles and clasps my shoulder “Don’t give up hope, have faith in the Lord.” As he briskly walks away, I realized I never got his name. “Wait, who are you?” He turns back and looks at me saying “Gabriel, they call me Gabriel” before he turns behind a building out of view. I ran after him, having more pressing questions, when I got to where he turned into. There was nothing there, just a brick wall. He faded away as fast as he showed up.

Part 6				Finally getting back to my car, I saw the havoc they left for me. It was in bad enough shape spending most of its life in the rust belt of the country. They decided slicing a tire and cracking my front windshield wasn't enough.  The lambs head which was still bleeding had been placed on my drivers seat. Bloody hand prints smeared up and down the both sides of my car; covering every door. Leading to the truck lid, where most of the blood was coming from. I hesitantly slid my key into the keyhole before turning and lifting the lid. My stomach instantly began to get queasy feeling; the bile rushed up from my stomach, I gagged as my eyes met the body of the lamb. My name was carved into the side of the disfigured and disemboweled animal. While digging  around the cadaver in an attempt to find my bag, laptop and chargers, I realized just how fresh this carcass was.  The still warm blood covered my hands while I felt around for my belongings. After locating and removing my items from the trunk,I looked up at the club’s front entrance. The door was shaking violently with what sounded like Latin coming from it. I slowly approached the door, feeling the indescribable unholy heat radiating from the door.  I realized I had no time to waste. Quickly putting my stuff on the passenger floor board and throwing the lambs head out of the car, I peeled out of the parking lot heading straight to Henry’s Pulling into Henry’s gravel driveway, I could see his porch light was on. Hundreds of swarming bugs attacking the light source, I lightly knocked on the door. A middle aged native American man slowly opened the door. His black hair was tightly pulled back away from his eyes, revealing a long scar over his right eye. “Hi, I am Eric. I am looking for Henry. Is he home?” The burly man nodded his head slowly while saying “I am Henry, you may come in.” Walking into Henry’s home, I noticed the old wooden paneling that ruled the living room walls. Gator heads and skulls hung on the walls and sat on dusty bookshelves.  I spun around to look at the man as I sat gently on his couch. He started to ask me about my business being here before hearing the high pitched whistle from his tea kettle. “Can I interest you in some tea before we get into business?”  I politely decline, learning from my past mistakes. Henry sat across from me at his coffee table in his rocking chair, “ So, what brings you to me?” He pondered sipping his steaming hot cup of tea. “I am Pastor Beau’s good friend. He’s been missing for four weeks now, Joel led me to Sierra which in turn led me to you. I am simply wanting him back, he's my only true friend.” Making eye contact with Henry as he slowly blows on his tea, he nods and sets it down slowly. “Ah, I see, so it is the preacher man you are here for. Beau is a good man, I do not know of anyone who would want to cause him harm. Do you happen to know where he went missing?” He questioned as he leaned back into his chair, “Yeah, I do. It was at the Baptist church in Chauvin. After his final fill-in sermon, he was supposed to head back to New Orleans afterwards but he never came back.” “Were there any messages or indicators of who did this?” Hank immediately asked. I told him all about the damaged bible, his shoe and of course the situation with Eve. Henry’s once stoic face turned into one of worry hearing about the demon encounter.  “You mentioned a dream after she drugged you, can you remember anything about the dream? Like smells, imagery, faces?” I responded cautiously “Yeah, in the dream I could see three or four men. They had decapitated goats heads on, horns and all. The eyes had been melon-balled out so they could see out of them, the blood refalling down their clothes. The smells of rot and decay wafted from them.” Henry leaned forward putting his hands together,” can you show me where this occurred?” I nodded my head while responding “Yes, I can. It is roughly thirty to forty minutes south in Chauvin. If you’d like, we can go now.” Henry quickly stood up, while saying “let me go get my coat.” Standing up and walking out back to my car, I remembered the lamb’s carcass decomposing in the trunk of it. I could smell the rot as I got closer to the car, by the time Henry came out. He watched me as I tried my best to fight this cadaver out of my trunk, “Let me guess, a gift from the Occult?” I stopped tugging at what I believed to be bottom half of the lamb, letting its hooves hang over the lip of my tailgate. “Occult?!” I exclaimed with confusion in my words. “Yes the Occult, ever heard of em?” as he walked up next to me helping me remove the body. “Yes, who hasn’t? I just didn’t know we had members of the occult in this area of Louisiana."" Henry, while walking away with the carcass proclaims “My mother was a medicine woman, she sold members items for rituals, spells and potions often” before throwing the lamb into the pond on his property. Once the initial splash on the water subsided, more loud splashing occurred. Around ten gators began to tear the remains to pieces.

Part 7 				The squeaking of my worn down windshield wipers took over the silent droning of the road noises heading back to Chauvin. The beams from my headlights cut through the dark of night, like the word of God cuts through darkness. Rapidly approaching the town, as the final rain drops hit the windshield, Chauvin was in complete and utter darkness.  No lights were on in the city. Every stoplight and lightpost had no power, as we closed in on the church. Off in the distance, we saw a giant pillar of light coming from around the church, the light dancing off the trees reminded me of the Mardi Gras parades at night. Half a mile away from the church, we finally saw what was causing the light, the church was on fire and rapidly burning down. Pulling into the drive of the old Baptist church slowly, we could hear the sound of the old bell ring out. My headlights revealed what appeared to be the entire town. They were dancing and running around this massive fire, wearing black cloaks with decapitated animal heads on each person. Real goats, lambs, pigs and sheep heads were used as face masks. The second Henry and I pulled into the parking lot, and stopped at the scene; the townspeople all stopped, turning their attention to us, standing silently staring at us. Henry stuttered while saying “Get us the hell out of here, NOW!” Quickly throwing my car into reverse, I put my full force down on the pedal. Cutting the wheel rapidly to the right, my tires screamed in protest as the vehicle lurched fast and hard to the left. Pointing the nose of our car to the edge of town, quickly throwing the gears from reverse to drive, I gunned it out of there. Howling and hooting could be heard from the crowd as they ran to their vehicles. “What in the ever loving hell was that!?” I screamed to Henry.  Running  his hands through his hair he answered, “You won’t like the answer but the final ritual has started. I roughly know where they’ll be.” Wiping the cold sweat off my forehead, I glance over at him. “Where will they be?” Henry looked back at me, as calmly as he could before answering, “An old cemetery out in the swamp, we may need an airboat or possibly walk there with flashlights. Did you happen to bring a spare?” I shook my head no while informing him “I only have one in my bag, there might be an extra in the glovebox in case I broke down at night.” Plopping open the old glovebox, my spare rusty blue flashlight revealed itself. “Good news, we’ve got two flashlights.” Checking the mirrors, I can see the headlights of tailing vehicles following us. Glancing back at the street signs, I see the dead end sign quickly go past my drivers side window, “We are running out of road here Henry, what do we do?” “Take this bend and floor it, the cemetery is off Bayou Terrebonne anyways. The water reclaimed the land around the cemetery some years back.” The sound of my engine was louder than ever as it rapidly approached thirty eight hundred revs per minute, topping out at seventy miles per hour. Every bump tossed my car and us around the road, “We only have one mile left of road, after that its on foot” Henry shouts out over the sounds of my car. “Then what?!” I shouted back, slamming on my breaks as we got closer to the bayou. “Follow me, keep close” He answered back over the sounds of my breaks protesting the amount of pressure I am putting them under; in an attempt to stop us before we drive straight into the bayou. Immediately after the car stopped, Henry grabbed the flashlight, clicking it on before taking off into the brush. I ripped my keys from the ignition, reaching into the back for my bag and successfully grabbing my flashlight before jumping out and dead sprinting after him into the dark. The convoy of lights rapidly approached behind us.

Part 8 			I am going to try my hardest to describe what happened to Henry and I over three weeks ago. Yes, I got out of that city and I am currently safe. I checked myself into Beacon Behavioral Hospital, it's a psychiatric hospital here in New Orleans. After successfully making it across the bayou, I followed Henry through the swamp. Our flashlight beams kept reflecting off the eyes of multiple alligators. Luckily Henry kept marshmallows on hand, as a lure to keep the gators away from us. I had never seen the night sky that full of stars before, the full moon's reflection bouncing off the water, allowing us to see more. Getting deeper into this swamp, the sound of hundreds of crickets, cicadas, frogs and the obnoxious onslaught of mosquitoes kept us company on this hike. Henry and I were on constant alert for snakes, continually doing three sixties with our lights to make sure the coast was clear. One of those times, Henry’s flashlight landed on a creature with the head of a wolf, its eyes glowing red, with the body of a large man. Henry yelled something in cajun french at it before it promptly sprinted away on all fours. Encroaching on the old cemetery, we could see torches lighting up the area. Skulls of all forms of mammals were on the iron fence posts. Some were  decayed and some still decaying, maggots eating away at the heads. The sounds that had accompanied us and kept us some level of comfort had long since subsided and  all we had then was the hanging dread. The only sound was coming from the men and women in cloaks,  all chanting in Latin holding lit candle sticks.  The hot wax was running down their bare hands.  In front of this crowd, standing on a stone stage behind an altar, was Joel. Beau was tied down on this stone altar, two makeshift drains leading to a massive summoning circle embedded in the ground. As Joel finished speaking in Latin to the crowd, Eve came up from behind Joel handing him an engraved knife. Joel plunged the knife into Beau’s stomach, cutting from his stomach, tossing his intestine to the side like an unwanted toy, continuing through his ribs finishing at his collarbone. His chanting in Latin continued as he pulled out Beau’s heart, giving it to Eve as she began to eat it. Henry began to vomit as I lost it, tears flowing down my face. I couldn't help but wail at that horrific sight, forever burned in my brain. Henry and I were quickly surrounded.  They zip-tied our hands behind our backs. Now placed on our knees a few feet in front of the altar, we could see Beau’s blood draining into the circle; rapidly flowing, filling the perfectly engraved channel.  Eve began to chant, her face smeared with blood.  As she continued to chant, the blood started boiling, the ground shaking harder and harder with each word she yelled out. Some of the members began to flee in panic, others stayed to see their plan successfully unfold. The ground cracked and faltered, caving in on itself. The unholy heat blasted us immediately.  The moans and wailing could be heard coming deep from within the pit. Unfortunately for those remaining members, several long-clawed, grey and weathered decaying demons began to crawl out of the pit opening, moving lightning fast. They snuffed out the candles as they tore the members to shreds, like starving, decrepit beasts,  dragging the remains back down to the pit with them. Joel came down the steps of the stage, looking down the pit with child-like wonder, smiling at his success.  His cheerful delight was cut off when Eve grabbed him from behind. Lifting the man up in one swoop like he was made of styrofoam. He cried out in fear, “Why are you doing this!?! This isn’t a part of the p-” He was cut off as she bent him in two. The cracking and crunching of his bones often echo in my head. Some of his ribs punched through his chest, the vertebrae completely visible. WIth a gleeful smile on her face, she tossed him like a chewed up chew toy into the pit. After vomiting at the scene, I felt Henry sneak up from behind me, cutting off my bounds.  “It’s time for us to leave” He whispered while grabbing me by the arm. Eve hissed “Just where exactly do you think you are going? Both of you belong to me now, and I will drain you slowly.” Henry took a brave step forward, his broad shoulders flexing as he did so. Holding his knife in his right hand, all his weight on his left foot. “Get out of here now, I will handle her.” Henry barked at me. Before I could even start backing away, she was on him like a lion on a wildebeest. In one fell swoop, her fist collided with his chest. I was stuck watching as his chest caved under the extreme force and pressure, he dropped like a sack of potatoes. She quickly discarded him into the pit, before turning all of her attention on me. She pounced on me with lighting speed, landing on top of me. My back and a part of my head in the water, my legs and hands were the only thing keeping her completely off me. Using my left forearm to keep her pushed back, her jaw started to unhinge. Her sharp teeth were all I could see, her ice cold breath on my face. I frantically started to search my back pocket to find anything to help me. That’s when I felt Beau’s cross necklace pressed against my hand. I began to pray, screaming out so the Lord almighty could hear me.”Your God cannot hear you now Boy!” She hissed right as I ripped the necklace out from my pocket. I shoved it in her mouth. She instantly started to scream, black smoke flowing out of her mouth. She cowered away from me, hacking and coughing while ripping at her own mouth trying to dislodge the cross. I prayed louder at the sight of this, feeling my hairs stand on end again with a calm peace washing over me like a tidal wave. As the fresh sunlight began to cover us like the hand of God she successfully pulled the necklace out, her hands now smoldering from where she touched it. Her ragged breath was all I could hear before she charged again. Feeling God's presence all around me, I began speaking in tongues. I calmly used her momentum to kick her off me, flinging her back down into the pit. I could hear her howling all the way down. After that, I ran back to my car full-tilt. Feeling my body begin to tremble with the overbearing anxiety running through my body like a hoard of fire ants crawling on me. My exhausted body fought the current back to the edge of the Bayou, my only way out just feet away. Dragging myself ashore, I had to collect myself on the bank. My ragged breathing was all I could hear as I wiped my snot and tears off my face. All the feelings crashed into me like a semi truck. I wallowed in my sorrow, soaked head to toe.  I could feel someone watching me from off in the distance.  Wasting no more time, I ran to my car. I forcefully shoved the key into the keyhole on the driver's side door, ripping the door open and threw myself into the car.  I cranked the engine over, threw the gear in drive and left that city in the rear view mirror. Roughly two hours after I left, I finally returned home to New Orleans. I felt somewhat at peace pulling into my parking spot outside of my apartment. That feeling didn’t last long.  That night after going to bed, I awoke to the sound of a child laughing coming from somewhere in my home. The feeling of unwanted dread covered me from head to toe; I could feel someone watching me. I immediately left home and checked myself into this hospital. The only thing I have with me besides this laptop, is my Bible. I  never stopped praying after the ritual, I feel like God is the only thing keeping me sane. I never leave this room, only taking my eyes off God’s word long enough to use the bathroom and eat. I spend all my free time talking with God, his grace covers me like a blanket. As I am writing this out, I can hear what sounds like great trumpets coming from Heaven. I look forward to seeing my Father in Heaven and Beau again.",1,1766172094.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I also very pretty and eventually went over to try and talk to her.

I introduced myself and she did as well. A little flirting began and I eventually asked her for her number.

She said yes and as she was grabbing her phone, her friend randomly interjected, got in between us and said “she’s not interested” and grabbed her hand and walked her away.

Luckily I ran into her later that night and I was able to get her number (grabbing coffee this weekend woop woop)

My question is what sign of this shows she’s not interested? She was about to give me her number, and I was about to 

However I notice this happens a lot (at least where I live). Girls will see their friend talking to a man and they immediately try to end the conversation between them without asking questions. 

Sometimes it’s very justified as the girl is NOT interested and even uncomfortable. Hell, I’ve stepped in to do that with some girls that I know. But sometimes it’s so blatant that she likes the guy and yet they still come in and claim things that just aren’t true.

I’ve never seen guys do this but to be fair I really just hang with my friend group and we’re always introducing each other to girls who we think would be good fits for our friends.

I’m just curious as to why this happens? I can imagine it has something to do with keeping them safe and not getting hurt, but why do this when they are having a good time talking to this person?

I went looking for a cool submarine photo today… and instead found a whole story.

Not just one picture — three snapshots of attitude, power, teamwork, and Silent Service swagger.

# 🚀 Those First Two Photos

That ain’t just a submarine “at speed.”

That’s a Skipjack-class legend saying:

>

She’s tearing through the water like she owes somebody money, throwing a bow wave that could knock the taste out of your mouth, reminding everyone why these boats were legends.

You can almost feel it:

* wind cutting your face
* the rumble under your boots
* the OOD yelling something important
* half the watch team pretending they aren’t freezing 🌊💨

Back before 4,000 screens and sensors that can hear shrimp sneeze — this was:

🧭 paper charts  
✏️ grease pencils  
☕ paint-stripping coffee  
💪 crews who didn’t need fanfare… they just needed to get it right

# 🚁 Now About the Photographer…

Whoever took those shots deserves:

🏅 a medal  
💰 a raise  
🧠 and maybe counseling

This wasn’t a drone.  
This wasn’t burst mode.  
This wasn’t “try again.”

This was some wild-eyed soul hanging halfway out of a helicopter with a 35mm camera… wind screaming… pilot yelling… boat hauling tail… and those boys running on adrenaline alone. ⚡

You *know* that flight sounded like:

>

No stabilization.  
No preview.  
No retakes.

Just one shot.  
One heartbeat.  
And a cockpit full of hootin’ and hollerin’ back to the LZ because they knew they caught lightning in a bottle. ⚡📸

# 🫡 Then the Third Photo…

Suddenly she’s calm.

Graceful.

Professional.

Sliding through the locks — most likely Panama — like a queen in a parade. 👑⚓

Crew topside.  
Line handlers locked in.  
Everyone doing that quiet, serious ballet that keeps bad days from happening. 🧠🧵

And back then?

It wasn’t inspection-ready, tactical-PR-approved super-uniforms like today.  
Nobody needed a photo committee, cue cards, or a branding department.

It was **good old Navy dungarees and khakis.** 👖👔  
Simple. Honest. Proven. Just like it ought to be.

Because back then…

👉 **we were pirates.** 🏴‍☠️

Cold War pirates with discipline, grit, humor, and absolute pride in what we did — unseen, uncelebrated, and deadly serious when it counted.

And we had **even greater captains to lead us into battle.** 🚢🧭

Leaders who trusted their crews… understood the mission… guarded morale like a tactical asset… and knew a tight, confident submarine crew could outrun storms, outrun fear, and outrun anything the world threw at them.

# ⚓ The Close

So here’s to **USS Shark (SSN-591)**…

To the speed.  
The swagger.  
The quiet professionalism.

And to every sailor who ever stood topside, held that wheel, ran that watch, trusted the guy next to him, and walked off with sea legs and a proud grin. 🇺🇸🦈

She ran like she owed somebody money…  
and carried herself like royalty when it mattered. 👑⚓

And every time I see photos like these…

I can still hear that ocean roar…  
feel the deck under my boots…  
and remember that quiet confidence that only comes from knowing your boat, trusting your crew, and doing hard things well. 💙🌊

Hey everyone, I'm here to share my three-month experience with Gluco6, a blood sugar support supplement that's been popping up in ads everywhere. As always, I need to be clear: I'm not a doctor. I'm a 52-year-old who was flagged with prediabetic fasting glucose levels at my last check-up. Motivated to make changes, I researched natural supplements and decided to put Gluco6's bold claims to a personal test.

**What Gluco6 Claims to Be:**  
According to its official website, Gluco6 is a dietary supplement that uses a ""breakthrough"" method. Instead of just adding more common ingredients, it focuses on supporting the body's **GLUT-4 receptors**—proteins crucial for transporting glucose from the bloodstream into cells. The idea is that by optimizing this process, you can prevent the sharp spikes and crashes that lead to fatigue and long-term issues.

**The ""Super 6"" Ingredients:**  
The formula is built around six key components:

* **Sukre:** Marketed as the star ingredient, a ""healthy sugar"" that supposedly takes pressure off GLUT-4 receptors.
* **Gymnema Sylvestre:** A well-known herb in Ayurvedic medicine for sugar metabolism.
* **Cinnamon Bark:** A common spice studied for its potential to support insulin sensitivity.
* **Chromium:** An essential mineral involved in carbohydrate and fat metabolism.
* **Green Tea Extract:** Provides antioxidants and may support metabolic rate.
* **TeaCrine®:** A patented compound from Chinese tea linked to energy and focus.

**My Testing Protocol & Starting Point:**  
My doctor recorded my fasting blood sugar at 112 mg/dL (in the prediabetic range). With his knowledge, I began a 90-day experiment:

1. **Consistent Use:** I took one Gluco6 capsule each morning before breakfast, as directed.
2. **Lifestyle Baseline:** I maintained my existing, moderately healthy diet and continued my routine of walking 30 minutes, 4 times a week. I did not make any drastic new changes to isolate the supplement's effect.
3. **Tracking:** I used a home glucose monitor to check my fasting levels every Monday and Wednesday morning. I also kept a daily journal rating my energy levels and sugar cravings.
4. **Medical Oversight:** I had follow-up blood work at my doctor's office after 90 days.

**My 90-Day Journey & Results:**

**Month 1: The Adjustment & First Signs**  
The first few weeks were about establishing the habit. The capsules were easy to swallow and caused no stomach upset.

* **Energy Shifts:** The most immediate change I noticed was a reduction in the **mid-afternoon energy crash**. I didn't need a 3 PM coffee to push through the workday. This was promising and kept me motivated.
* **Cravings:** My desire for sugary snacks, especially after dinner, began to diminish noticeably by the end of the first month.
* **Glucose Readings:** My at-home fasting readings were variable but started to show a slight downward trend, often dipping just below 110 mg/dL.

**Month 2: Noticeable Stabilization**  
This is where the effects felt more consistent and integrated into my daily life.

* **Steady Energy:** The stable energy throughout the day became the new normal. I felt more productive and less mentally foggy.
* **Readings Improve:** My weekly fasting glucose readings became more consistently in the 105-108 mg/dL range.
* **The ""Sukre"" Question:** I remained skeptical about this proprietary ingredient. While the overall formula seemed to be working for me, the lack of independent, third-party studies specifically on ""Sukre"" was a point of caution.

**Month 3: Results & The Big Picture**  
By the final month, the routine was solid, and I had clear data.

* **Doctor's Visit Results:** My official lab work showed my **fasting glucose had dropped to 101 mg/dL**, moving me back into the normal range. My A1C also showed improvement.
* **Non-Scale Victory:** I lost about 8 pounds over the three months without trying, which my doctor said often goes hand-in-hand with better glucose control.
* **Sustainable Feeling:** I felt in control of my health without feeling restricted. The supplement seemed to support my existing efforts effectively.

**What Worked Well:**

1. **Effective Support:** For me, it provided a tangible, positive effect on my energy stability and glucose numbers.
2. **Comprehensive Formula:** The combination of established ingredients like Gymnema and Cinnamon with the novel approach (GLUT-4 focus) felt more targeted than other blends.
3. **No Side Effects:** I experienced no negative digestive or other side effects.
4. **Convenience:** One capsule a day was an easy routine to maintain.

**Important Realities & Cautions:**

1. **It's a Supplement, Not a Cure:** Gluco6 worked *in conjunction with* my ongoing diet and exercise habits. It is not a magic pill that allows for poor lifestyle choices.
2. **The ""Sukre"" Transparency Issue:** The website's explanation of Sukre is vague. As a consumer, I prefer full transparency about what I'm putting in my body.
3. **""Backed by Research"" vs. ""Proven"":** The site cites general research on GLUT-4 and individual ingredients, but this is not the same as clinical trials on the finished Gluco6 product itself.
4. **Medical Guidance is Essential:** **This is the most important point.** I would never have started this without my doctor's awareness. Blood sugar management is serious, and supplements can interact with medications.

**Final Verdict:**  
In my 90-day test, Gluco6 was a successful tool that helped me improve my prediabetic markers and regain consistent daily energy. It provided the support I was looking for as part of a broader health strategy.

However, its effectiveness seems deeply tied to maintaining healthy habits. The lack of complete transparency around its signature ingredient is a drawback for the scientifically-minded. If you are considering it, you must do so as an informed consumer and **only under the guidance of your healthcare provider.** It could be a valuable support for some, but it is not a standalone solution.

**I'll share the official manufacturer link in the comments** for those who want to research it further after consulting with their doctor.

Hey everyone, I'm here with a review that's a bit different. I tested the **Neuro Energizer**, which isn't a pill or a powder, but a digital audio program that makes some pretty wild claims. The website says listening to a special 7-second audio track daily can stimulate your brain's ""genius bridge"" (the corpus callosum), supposedly unlocking sharper focus, memory, and creativity by mimicking the effects of Einstein's violin practice. As someone perpetually chasing better mental clarity, I was equal parts skeptical and curious enough to try it for 90 days.

**My Situation & Skepticism:**  
I'm a 38-year-old project manager. My skepticism was sky-high. The sales page tells a dramatic story about Einstein's stolen brain and features a ""Dr. Orson MacQuoid,"" a neuroscientist I couldn't independently verify. It promises life-altering results from a 7-second audio clip, which frankly, sounds too good to be true. I decided to approach it as an experiment: could this simple, daily habit make any discernible difference, or was it just a well-marketed gimmick?

**What Neuro Energizer Actually Is:**  
Let's be clear on what you're buying, because it's important:

* **It's a Digital Audio File:** You purchase access to a special audio track online.
* **The 7-Second Promise:** The core claim is that listening to this specific frequency for just 7 seconds a day is enough to ""activate"" your brain.
* **The ""Science"" Story:** The entire premise is built on a narrative linking Einstein's thick corpus callosum to his violin playing, suggesting this audio replicates those benefits.
* **One-Time Cost:** I paid the advertised price of $39 for lifetime access. There was no hidden subscription.

**My Testing Method:**  
To give it a fair shot, I committed to a strict routine:

* **Consistency:** I listened to the 7-second track every single morning, right after my alarm, using good-quality headphones.
* **Tracking:** I kept a simple journal, rating my daily focus, mental fog, and productivity on a scale of 1-10.
* **Control:** I didn't change my other habits—same coffee intake, sleep schedule, and diet—to see if the audio alone had an effect.
* **Real-World Tasks:** I paid attention to my performance in specific areas: writing reports, learning new software for work, and my ability to concentrate in open-office noise.

**90-Day Experience Breakdown:**

**Month 1: The Placebo Phase & Ritual Building**  
The first month was mostly about building the habit. The audio itself is a brief, somewhat pleasant tonal sound.

* **Immediate Effect?** For the first two weeks, I noticed a slight ""reset"" feeling—a moment of calm after listening. This felt more like the benefit of taking a deliberate 7-second pause than a neurological shift.
* **Journal Data:** My daily scores were erratic. Some days I felt great, others foggy. No clear pattern emerged that I could link to the audio.
* **The Ritual Value:** The one undeniable benefit was the ritual itself. Having a dedicated 7 seconds to intention-set for the day was surprisingly pleasant, but I suspect any mindful pause could do the same.

**Month 2: Looking for Subtle Shifts**  
I listened for more subtle, cumulative changes.

* **Focus & Flow:** I did have a few exceptional days of deep focus. However, they correlated more often with good sleep and low stress than with the audio.
* **The Placebo Question:** Was I *trying* to be sharper because I'd invested in this program? Quite possibly. The power of belief is strong.
* **No Negative Effects:** I experienced no headaches, dizziness, or ill effects, which was a positive.

**Month 3: The Long-Term Verdict**  
By the final month, the experiment had reached its conclusion for me.

* **No Transformation:** I did not experience a ""genius state,"" unlock hidden mental superpowers, or see my problem-solving ability radically change. My cognitive performance remained within my normal range.
* **The Ritual Stuck:** The 7-second morning ritual had become a nice habit for mental preparation, akin to a mini-meditation.
* **Value Assessment:** For $39, I bought a simple audio file and a structured reason to pause for 7 seconds each day. The extravagant claims of ""tapping into Einstein's brainpower"" were not substantiated in my experience.

**What the Website Doesn't Tell You (The Realities):**

1. **Zero Verifiable Science:** The site mentions ""EEG scans"" and ""research"" but provides **no links, study names, or credible citations**. The entire premise rests on a marketing story, not transparent science.
2. **The ""Doctor"" is Unverified:** The central figure, ""Dr. Orson MacQuoid,"" has no verifiable presence or published work in mainstream neuroscience. This is a major red flag.
3. **Contradicts Known Neurology:** The idea that 7 seconds of sound can rewire brain structure trivializes the concept of neuroplasticity, which is built through consistent, sustained effort over time.
4. **Testimonials are Not Evidence:** The glowing success stories are classic marketing material, not controlled evidence.

**Final Honest Thoughts:**  
Neuro Energizer did not deliver on its extraordinary promises of genius-level cognitive enhancement for me. It functioned as a brief, daily mindfulness trigger—which has value—but not as a revolutionary brain tool.

If you are looking for a small, simple ritual to start your day with a moment of focus, and you don't mind the $39 cost for a short audio file, you might find some utility in it as a behavioral cue. However, if you are seeking real, evidence-based support for memory, focus, or cognitive health, this is not it. You would be better served by established methods like consistent exercise, quality sleep, mindfulness meditation, or consulting with a healthcare professional about reputable nootropic supplements.

I’m looking for advice on choosing my next espresso machine and grinder. I currently live alone, but my girlfriend stays with me about two days a week. On those days, she drinks one or two milk-based drinks (usually just coffee with milk). She might move in in about six months, so I’d like something that can handle both espresso and milk drinks well.

I drink about six espressos a day, mostly straight, because my current machine can’t steam at all. I also enjoy milk-based drinks from time to time, so I’d like a machine that can do both reliably.

My budget is around €1000 for the machine and €500 for the grinder, but I’m flexible to a certain extent—better to invest in something long-term than to upgrade again in six months.

I’m considering the Profitec Go or Lelit Mara X, but I’m not sure if these are the right machines for me. I’m also open to used options if they offer better value.

For grinders, I’m leaning toward single dosing to experiment with different beans. I’m currently looking at the DF64 Gen 2, Timemore Sculpture 64S, and Niche Zero (though the Niche is hard to get in Germany).

A little background: My girlfriend gifted me a Barista course after I mentioned wanting to get into espresso. It was fun, but I’m now a bit afraid of making the wrong decision with my next machine.

Has anyone here used these machines or grinders? Which combination would you recommend for someone who mainly drinks espresso but also enjoys milk-based drinks occasionally?

1pqtmno,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1pqtmno/scarlet_lady_riviera_maya_review/,Scarlet lady riviera maya review,"Just got off my first VV cruise as a solo (literally, I'm still in Miami) and I loved it!

Overall, a 10/10 experience. I'm a first time cruiser and usually a ""walk 20k steps in a day urban explorer"" type of traveler so this was quite different for me.  I ""get"" cruising now. I see why people do it.

Anyway, below is is my comprehensive experience.

TL;DR : excellent experience, the spa is not worth it

Booking:

Super easy. I booked through the Virgin sales team who reached out after I put a hold on the booking. He was able to get me some extra sailor loot. My initial booking was for a limited view sea terrace.

Upgrade:

Decided I couldn't live with a view of a lifeboat, so I bid $110 ( a ""good"" bid) on central sea terrace which was accepted.

Travel to port:

This took an hour from south beach. My Lyft driver dropped me off next door at the carnival terminal due to the chaos. But getting to port was a huge pain, leave with plenty of time.

Embarkation:

Extremely quick and painless. Dropped my bag off with the porter and got in 15 minutes before my boarding time. Bag arrived within 30 minutes.

Room:

I had a central sea terrace on deck 8. The room was beautiful and included a cute ornament and two pins for the holidays. Being a solo traveler, it was more than enough storage for me and I didn't do any ""hacks"" like bringing extra hooks. And I also don't travel light. But I had plenty of room with all the various shelves and hangers. I will say the bathroom was tiny and I can't imagine sharing it with another human, but it worked for me.

Anyway, the in room tablet to control the lighting and curtains was very cool. My absolute favorite part was the iconic red hammock on the balcony. I spent tons of time out there staring at the ocean. Extremely happy with my choice to upgrade.

Deck 8 was really well placed; lots of venues are on deck 6 and 7.  Being mid-deck meant I didn't get any noise from the clubs or anything.

Food:

There's a lot of stress about this online, I was able to get reservations easily as a solo. I did test kitchen, extra virgin, Gunbae and the wake. I thought all the food at the restaurants  was great! However, my experience at Gunbae was weird bc one of the people at my table was not happy and complained to the manager. So that was awkward!

The galley was fine but not amazing.  I appreciated all the options, however especially the late night burger bar and breakfast (needed because they do NOT water these drinks down!). Also loved the option of things like muesli and overnight oats in the morning.

I did room service twice and it wasn't bad.

Drinks

I did not do a bar tab because of my sailor loot and because I didn't want to put money down I may not use. I also bought wine on board with me and had that to pregame. Still drank way too much with my solo sailor friends! My favorite bar was on the rocks on deck 6 but all the drinks were excellent. I thought the drinks were priced fine, i think the most I paid was $16 for a martini at the wake, which sadly is par for the course these days even on land.

The free drip coffee was pretty basic, but the espresso bars were nice.

Ship activities

I wanted to chill on this trip so I spent a lot of time doing just that in my hammock or on deck 7 AFT (the dock) or deck 15 AFT (by the galley). I didn't book any excursions in Cozumel (just as well since I didn't feel well that day) and only did a half day in Bimini. I did step out in Cozumel but i decided I didn't want to walk around too much, just popped into a few shops.

However...I did do a few things other than relax: the grog walk (recommended as a solo as it's designed to have you chat with others and i met some very nice people), bingo with the diva (highly entertaining), karaoke (lots of fun), and the tea service (sweets heavy but still good).

I will say the one thing that was a let down was the thermal spa. I'm a spa person and have been to many high end spas on day passes and this was, as the kids say, mid. I did it on a port day and it was fine, but I would not do it again.

Scarlet night was a fun spectacle. I skipped the pj party bc I was already wiped from the grog walk.

Bimini beach club was fun, but I was done after spending the entire morning there. I think this would have been more fun for me if I'd been in my 20s or if I would have been in a cabana.

Disembarkation

The Virgin process was nice and easy. it was nice to have the option to sleep in and have more time to pack and have breakfast. No issues with customs as you just do face recognition similar to global entry.

Getting out of port was terrible. I waited for an hour for a taxi and my cell service kept going down so I couldn't order a Lyft or Uber. Next time I'm hiring a driver or leaving earlier. It's also sad to see the people dropping off their luggage knowing that was you just five days ago.

Solo traveler stuff:

The solo sailor meetup was great! I ended up making a few ""cruise friends"" at that and at the grog walk to spend time with and I'm not particularly adept socially so if I can do it, anyone can!

I also felt completely safe as a solo female traveller. The staff were all great and very welcoming.

Anyway, I'll stop rambling now. Feel free to ask any questions",19,1766171590.0,VirginVoyages,22,0.95,False

I am quite happy with myself. For instance, I am very grateful to be studying my dream subject at university. I have hobbies that I am passionate about. I have a few close friends although I do not see them regularly because we are now in different parts of the world. I exercise and take care of myself.

1pqtfm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToeflAdvice/comments/1pqtfm8/first_attempt_at_toefl_106120/,First Attempt at TOEFL [106/120],"**Greetings everyone**,

I am Mehmet from Turkiye. I recently took the TOEFL iBT exam and scored a 106 out of 120. Although I know that the exam structure is soon changing significantly, I wanted to share my detailed experience before and during the exam, in case it might help those who will undertake this challenge have a clearer idea of what to expect. I read multiple entries on the r/ToeflAdvice subreddit before the exam, and it certainly helped. Thus, I wanted to contribute with my experience. I believe these kinds of posts especially help people from countries like Turkiye, where the economy is unstable, exchange rates are extremely high, and thus, the exam fee is too expensive to make multiple attempts (it is almost half the minimum wage in Turkiye, and most people work for the minimum wage). Without further ado, I want to start with my preparation.

# Exam Prep

To be honest, I spent about a week, a couple of hours a day, on the preparation, and most of it was practice tests.

Before anything, however, I have to say that I am not a beginner English learner. Since my childhood, most of the content I consume online has been in the English language. The games I played, the shows and movies I watched, the tutorial videos, anything you could think of. Also, although in Turkiye, I did my Bachelor's and I am about to finish my Master's in programs taught in English. I am trying to make the point that, unless you are already comfortable with using the language to some extent, I don't think the way I prepared will be effective enough, and it might be better to take more time to cover some grammar and vocabulary before attempting the test. If this sounds relatable, however, please allow me to share my preparation week.

**Reading/Listening**  
Because of the way I've been learning English, mostly by being at the receiving end of the 'conversations', I trust my passive skills better. So, for the first **2-3 days**, I just attempted as many practice tests as I could. There are plenty of websites that offer free section tests, which can be full-length or partial samples. Some are even interactive with buttons and a timer, but it is not too difficult to manually track time and note the answers on a piece of paper.

I made sure to use a timer at each attempt. This will definitely help you get used to the tempo and give you ideas on how you can cut corners while answering questions. For example, finding the related information in the paragraph quickly, or not even reading the whole question prompts, while answering vocabulary questions that ask for the synonym of a word.

Also, I tried to optimize the way I took notes during listening questions. Note-taking is especially an important skill in the next sections, and starting to establish this at the relatively easier listening part helped me later on.

**Writing**  
Since I also find writing relatively manageable, because I've had a fair amount of experience with writing both from school and online platforms, I spent about **1 day** practicing for the writing section. Again, you can find practice questions online. With that being said, I want to tell you about how I utilized AI tools for practicing the active sections. I specifically used [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app) because I recently obtained a free Pro plan using my student status. For writing, I first uploaded the official writing rubric of ETS. Then, I prompted the chat with details on how to behave, how to score, how to give feedback etc., to personalize my experience. I also prompted how I would upload my attempts (I might later add here the structure I used to upload my attempts). For writing, everything was in text. Although it was time-consuming, I converted the listening parts to text transcripts instead of uploading audio files, and it was worth it in the end. I didn't upload any files except the rubric. It worked smoothly.

Again, using a timer is absolutely recommended. Also, try to make sure you use the keyboard layout you will use at the exam center (likely English QWERTY, as it was for me).

**Speaking**  
Then comes the speaking section. I spent the remaining **3 or so days** practicing speaking. Along with the practice tests I took, I watched lots of YouTube videos that provide example answers and evaluations to understand what contributes to the score, and what a good-enough answer sounds like.

>The most striking realization for me, however obvious it might be to others, was that no one cares about who you are and what you actually think. Especially for the Task 1 of speaking section, independent speaking, don't try to come up with fancy points of view or deep reflections on the idea you are trying to support. Make up stories, lie about yourself, proceed not with what you actually think but what is easier to talk about. What matters is talking consistently and coherently for about 45 seconds with a good flow, intonation and rythm.

One more thing about the independent speaking task:

>It helped me a lot to have list of possible 'reasons' that can be generally relevant for a lot of opinions. What I had in mind were money/cost, time/efficiency, mental/physical health, relationships/social life, personal growth/experience. When tyou hear the question, qucikly scan this mental list and pick the easiest 2 options that are relatable.

The speaking section was where practicing with AI shone for me. Again, you can find lots of practice questions for all four tasks. It was a little frustrating at first because Gemini chat kept crashing and giving errors. Finally, I found a sweet spot, and here is how it worked for me. Similar to writing practice, I first uploaded the speaking rubric and adjusted the responses with prompts. Then, I recoded my answers using my laptop's voice recorder app. After I was done with all the tasks I wanted to attempt, I again converted all the listening parts to text transcripts. There are online tools that can do this, but you can always manually convert the speeches by writing them word by word. In the end, except for the rubric, the only files I uploaded were my voice-recorded answers, and all the rest was text. Also, .wav and .mp3 file extensions worked more reliably for me.

At first, I was not able to keep up with the time, and all my answers were getting cut off before I finished my sentences. I was attempting the same questions twice to understand what changes affect my speaking efficiency. I was trying to apply the feedback and suggestions from the chatbot, and it actually worked.

Running against the timer helped me the most in speaking sections. When I realized that I was speaking at a very low rate, I panicked a little, but I solved this with some practice.

I only took section tests and didn't attempt a full mock test.

Next, I would like to tell you about my exam experience.

# Exam Day

I want to give you a full narration of the day I took the exam (or rather what I remember of it) so that you can imagine how it might go for you when your time arrives.

**Before The Exam**  
Since I live in a town, I had to travel to the city center, about an hour by car. Thus, I woke up early, ate my breakfast, and hit the road. I always like to give myself a minimum of an hour extra to solve any inconveniences that might occur. I arrived earlier than I should, and I didn't get stressed about being late. I left my belongings in the car before entering the test center, only to realize that there was a waiting lounge where I could leave my things. They also provided transparent sealed bags to keep the precious belongings in the testing room. Moreover, I don't know if it is the same for every center, but they offered us free water, freshly brewed coffee, and tea. I had access to a clean restroom, too. The personnel were really friendly and helpful. I was relaxed overall, except for the excitement of taking this exam for the first time.

About half an hour before the exam time, they proceeded with the check-in procedure. They let a single student into the examination hall at a time. They then used the central computer to take a picture of the student. After that, a paragraph appears on the screen for the student to read out loud into the microphone. If I am not mistaken, this is used to sample the student's voice for later analysis of your test answers. I remember there was a countdown at the bottom of the screen, and the student had to make sure the timer started before starting to talk. The student was expected to speak clearly, consistently, and with enough voice level for the microphone to pick up sound. The student might not finish the whole paragraph in time, but this was not important as long as the voice was sampled clearly. For some students, they had to repeat this several times. For others, on the other hand, it worked the first time. ETS had sent a sample of this paragraph a few days before the exam day via email, so that the students could familiarize themselves with the content. It read something like ""My name is .... Today's date is .... I confirm that I will not tell the questions to anyone ... etc.""

After this, each student was assigned a desk, equipped with a computer, a monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, and a headset with a microphone. They also provided 3 sheets of A4 paper and 2-3 pencils for each student. In the session I attended, there were 6 students, including me.

Don't worry if the check-in process takes a while; the exam does not start until the personnel starts it for you. They start everyone's exams at the same time.

**Reading/Listening**  
This section was relatively easy, as expected. I didn't think too much about the questions and tried to answer as quickly as possible. I think that in the reading section, I had more of the easier questions or questions I could answer relatively quickly. This might also be because the mock tests I took sampled questions uniformly, while the real exam questions came with varying rarities. There were a few questions I had to guess either because I did not want to spend too much time reading a paragraph again, or because I missed a small detail in the listening part. I probably finished the Reading and Listening sections a few minutes earlier than the given time.

If I am not mistaken, the exam does not proceed to the next section unless you click a button, and I did not see any timers counting on the screen. So, I took a second to take a breath before starting the speaking section.

**Speaking**  
When I started the speaking section, I listened to the Task 1 question, and suddenly, I had a panic attack. I was the first person in the room to break the silence. My stomach started to churn, my hands started shaking, and I was not able to write on the paper. I just started saying the first things that came to my mind, and thankfully, I warmed up in a few seconds. However, since I couldn't structure my idea in the given 15 seconds due to the panic, I blanked out and couldn't speak for more than 5 seconds until the timer ran out in the end.

After that, I gathered myself and progressed through the remaining 3 tasks smoothly. I might have ran out of time on a question, but it was just a word or two that I couldn't say.

The only drawback was that everyone was speaking at the same time after a while. So you must be ready for that noisy interval.

I again took a second to shake off the feeling that the speaking section left on me.

**Writing**  
I was quite relaxed as I started the writing section. I did not rush anything. In Task 1, I quickly skimmed through the paragraphs and noted the main ideas of each one. Then I listened to the lecture and took detailed notes on what the lecturer said, filling in the main ideas I noted from the text. Since the reading passage was visible as I wrote, I just looked up the information I needed to include and paraphrased it. I wrote about 300 words (less than that, actually) and spent about 5 minutes proofreading. I read from bottom to top, so that my brain couldn't auto-correct the mistakes. I corrected as many words or grammatical errors as I could notice. The second task was easier. I don't remember the number of words I wrote, but it was slightly more than the recommended. I had time to proofread again, and I finished the exam.

In the last screen, I had 2 choices. **Cancel** and **Report**. Cancel means you don't want this exam to be evaluated, so be careful and choose the Report option. Actually, I can't think of a reason for cancelling the test, but in case you need it, you have the option to do so.

Right after I selected Report, I got my unofficial Reading and Listening scores, and then left the center. They even let me get a cup of coffee to go.

# My Evaluation

I am happy with my overall score. My goal was to reach 100/120, and I was prepared for a 90/120. However, my Reading and especially Speaking scores were below my expectations. Or rather, my performance was worse than in my practice tests, so I actually expected these scores. If I were a bit more careful in the Reading section, and I hadn't panicked in the speaking task, I feel like I could easily make at least 110/120. And to be honest, without a serious and targeted preparation, I don't think I could do any better than that.

# General Advice

Lastly, I want to list a few suggestions that came to my mind.

1. Learn the structure of the exam. There are 4 sections, and each has its specific contents. The questions change from exam to exam, but I was surprised to know how much of the exam was kept identical, and it almost felt like cheating. For example, in Task 1 of the Writing section, there are always 3 paragraphs where 3 different aspects of something are discussed. Then the lecturer always opposes these in order, in three paragraphs of his speech. You should learn how many questions are in each section, what type of questions are there, which task asks for what, and what is the order of occurrence in the exam, etc. This will ensure that you are getting fewer surprises during the exam.
2. In the speaking section, everyone speaks at the same time. There weren't any noise cancellation or passive isolation on the headsets. So you will hear what others say. Expect this beforehand and make sure to stay focused on your tasks instead of what others are saying. I found it helpful to crank the sound on my test application up so that I don't miss any details in the listening parts of the Speaking section.
3. I don't think you have to pay for any courses or practice materials. At least if you are not starting from scratch. Hunt and devour whatever free material you can find. Websites like [TOEFL Resources](https://www.toeflresources.com/) were really helpful. ETS has its own free materials and plenty of explanations on its website. I also watched videos from YouTube channels like [NoteFull TOEFL Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@NoteFullTOEFLMastery), [TOEFL Test](https://www.youtube.com/@TOEFL_test_with_LinguaTrip), [TST Prep TOEFL](https://www.youtube.com/@TSTPrep). One of the pinned posts on r/ToeflAdvice lists plenty of materials.
4. Make use of AI tools. Whether it is ChatGPT, Gemini, or another AI assistant, find a way to use it to your benefit. I especially recommend using them for the Speaking and Writing practices. Even ETS uses AI (although partially) to evaluate Speaking and Writing.
5. Stay confident through the exam. Even if you make a mistake or mess up a part, you still will have a chance to recover until the end. You can punish yourself after the exam is finished, use all your energy for whatever remaining part you still have to complete. I am saying this because I almost messed up Task 1 of the Speaking section, and gave up, but I recovered.
6. Have fun! It is not likely that you are being forced to take this exam. It's rather that you want to take the exam because you have a goal to achieve. So instead of being nervous and scared, have fun and own the experience.

That's all for now. I hope this wasn't a boring waste of time, and I hope I can be of help to at least someone. I will try to answer any specific questions you might have.

I am sorry for all the mistakes in my writing (about my TOEFL experience, how ironic :D). I am not proofreading this :D

Best of luck,

Mehmet

AITA for getting mad at my best friend/ business partner.

So early this summer me and my best friend (we will call her Emily) started a small business making handmade items that take a lot of work. 

Overall we have had a lot of fun but we do butt heads on somethings, some of the thing I have gotten upset about I feel like she puts the business on the back burner a lot until the last minute no matters how much I beg her for us to work on things and especially never prioritizes the events for smelling the items and her thinking it’s ok for us to just show up whenever and it will often be hours after the even started. she will get upset at me if I stop taking as much initiative but this frustrates me because at the same time i feel like she won’t let me and just bosses me around. 

For context we work out of her house because she has a very large house and I live out of one room so i often don’t have much choice in these matters if she fights me on it. 

Now a few weeks ago it was small business Saturday we had 2 important events we were signed up for but she had gotten sick after thanksgiving so i tried to take charge and do one of the events at our friends shop cause they could help me, but she had her mom text me and tell me that we weren’t going to be doing the events today but i had stated o would be doing it alone so i took this as her saying she wasn’t allowing me to take charge without her, but a few days after this passed when i finally heard from her she said it was a miscommunication. 

Now fast forward to the next Saturday it’s the towns biggest small business event of the year I had barley heard from her that hole week apart from that conversation and one other where she just answered the phone and she she couldn’t talk and hung up on me so i was confused and had just gotten a text from her the night before confirming we are going. (For more context for this next part I work another job she currently does not. As well as I am disabled with chronic pain and walking problems) But given how the week had gone, and the fact she was always late to this businesses events, and that I worked the night before and after the event was over and was already in a lot of paint i decided to just let her take charge that morning and wait to hear from her but watched her location because we both share it with each other to make sure she didn’t leave without saying anything. 

Finally she calls me over an hour after we are supposed to be there and tells me she’s leaving, so I go barrow the keys from my mom because I have to barrow her car at the moment because mine broke down and put my contacts in and then I call her to say I’m leaving but she says that the lady to check in is gone and she’s not sure what to do because of how full it was that day so not to leave until she can figure something out so I told her I’d wait to her from her, hours later she tells me she’s decided not to bother (what I had pieces together on my own. 

Now fast forward a day or two later I bring up the next weekends events (that Friday and Saturday) we are supposed to do and then she tells me that she thinks instead of me and her doing it her and her are going to get a hotel room the nights in between so they can do what married couples do without their dogs around. I was annoyed that after how the other weekends before Christmas had gone but thought whatever I’ll stay home and try to pickup some shifts because she isn’t a fun person to argue with and I knew she wouldn’t understand my point of view. 

But Thursday night she said that her husband friends were going to a little EDM show and that she did actually want me to come and that we would all stay in a hotel to be closer to both events, i thought it would be a little work a little play and agreed. Friday morning I asked what time the candle event was that day because she does the booking she said she decided we weren’t going to do Friday because there hadn’t been enough time to prepare, again kind of annoyed but at least we were doing Saturday together so I went with the flow. 

We check into the hotel and her husbands friends come before the show and him and his friends started doing party favors and she was taking a lot of shots but Im sober so I just stayed in the bathroom getting ready at this point is when I had the feeling when the morning comes they are not going to want to do business stuff so I asked what time do we have to check into tomorrow to what she replied “I don’t care it doesn’t maybe will show up when I’m ready to show up”, and this feeling of this will be another wasted business opportunity grew more and more as the night went come 4AM after the show his friends were still doing their thing in our room to what i started getting annoyed and said so are we going to bed at any point and she got confused and said I always go to bed at some point I said I mean at a decent time she said can you not go to bed? (Keep in mind the room she got didn’t had a pull out bed for me what it didn’t but even if it did him and his friends were on the couch) I said no I can’t with a room full of people doing “party favors” all night ( not the exact words I used) and she replied that she couldn’t make anyone do anything but she was sure they would leave soon. 

At that point I sent her a text because i didn’t want people to hear me that I didn’t know why we put on so much work of none of the events were going to be prioritized to what I watched her swipe it away without a second glance. 

Eventually they left, I tried to go to bed, but they stayed up hours after that being very loud. 

The next morning as I suspected they slept past check out I eventually work them up because I went outside to smoke and my key stopped working and they started saying we didn’t have time to make check in and that there was no point in going. We went to check out and me and her had to stay behind in the lobby coffee shop while her husband ran her other friend they picked up because with all our business stuff there wasn’t room for all of us. 

That’s when she brought up the text and stated that while she knows how i feel to what I said you don’t though because I haven’t gotten to tell you and she said that she was talking right now and that we weren’t going to have this talk if I said anything so I let her talk and she said I ruined the putting for her and that she needed it because everything had been all work no play, I asked if I could speak she said in kind of a condescending voice like a kindergarten teacher talking to a toddler “I’d love for you to talk now”. So I said I was had been frustrated that she hadn’t cared about any events for awhile now and that one of our last big events before the winter was over turned into her and her husbands romantic get away until it came to something with his friends, and that the fact we are supposed to be business partners didn’t seem to matter much at all even when I am willing to give up shift at my actual job for this and break my back doing long hours at both. 

To what she got offended saying she couldn’t believe I’d say she didn’t care after how much money she has put in and I said that’s why I didn’t understand why she didn’t care about selling any of it and how after what happened last weekend I thought she would start taking it more seriously, to what she blamed me for not calling her over and over all morning like every other time I blamed the fact I don’t have my own car right now what didn’t make sense because I had a car that day she didn’t have to come get me to what I told her i had a car and I hadn’t even heard from her until the night before and she hasn’t been letting me take charge so I was waiting for her to let me know what was going on and then she said I told you that the weekend before that was a misunderstanding, and then said I just didn’t understand mental health I said I do understand mental health because I have to push through it and chronic pain for both jobs and that’s why I tried to take care of things any time she got sick but that I don’t understand throwing away every last event we had for the season when there was other options or prioritizing partying or doing her husband. And then she said that maybe we shouldn’t be business partners to what I replied well maybe we shouldn’t be friends she called me a bitch and I left and got a different ride home. 

She offered to talk that night but I said I needed time because I had picked up a shift after I got into town and hadn’t had time to eat or process everything, my next day off I said I was ready to talk and she said if things stay calm what I took kind of sideways because it felt like she was blaming everything on me so I just didn’t reply and we have not spoken since. 

So am I the asshole for A getting upset with her for not prioritizing our business, B bringing our friendship into the business because my other friend said that I shouldn’t have brought that into things, and C not responding to her last text?",1,1766171080.0,okstorytime,1,1.0,False

I feel like we live in a culture these days that normalises being flaky and prioritising yourself which is good advice if you spread yourself too thin but also I don’t understand why you wouldn’t just set boundaries with yourself rather than make it other people’s problem to deal with when you make them set aside time for you and then cancel last minute.

# What is early direct deposit?

Early direct deposit basically means you could get access to your paycheck before your official payday. As soon as they get the payroll file from your employer, they drop the money into your account. That could mean you’ll get your paycheck up to 2 business days early. 

This is why people search specifically for banks that offer early direct deposit. Once you try it, waiting for your official payday feels ancient.

# How early direct deposit helps you dodge late fees

Late fees happen for one simple reason: your paycheck and your bills aren’t on speaking terms. Early direct deposit helps them finally get along.

# 1. You get cash before your bills are due

Rent, utilities, and apps you forgot you subscribed to—it can feel like all the payments are due at the same time. If your paycheck lands early, you’re covered before anything auto-withdraws.

# 2. You can actually plan your money

Instead of sweating it out and refreshing your bank app like it’s r/wheresmypaycheck, early pay could help with timing payments and expenses.

# 3. You can stop panicking

If you know money is coming early, you hopefully won’t have to scramble. 

# How early direct deposit helps you avoid overdrafts

Overdrafts usually happen when spending hits before your paycheck does. Early direct deposit gives you more buffer and helps you stay safely in the positive. Here’s how:

# 1. Your balance won’t dip in the red

More money in your account sooner could mean fewer accidental overdrafts.

# 2. You’re covered before auto-payments hit

Those surprise autopays don’t stand a chance if you already have cash in the account up to two business days early.

# 3. You skip the tiny purchase, huge fee trap

A little buffer goes a long way. With early direct deposit, small purchases stay small. And you could avoid getting hit with an up to $35 overdraft fee when you buy a $5 cup of coffee.

If you’re tired of not having enough cash for bills, getting ambushed by higher overdraft fees, and feeling like you’re playing financial whack-a-mole, early direct deposit is a game changer.

1pqtcr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pqtcr4/hr_curtain_call/,[HR] Curtain Call,"The light flicks on over a flight of basement steps; the single lightbulb illuminates the stairway that descends to the dark but not vacant basement. The only sound was the light bulb's hum. Fabrizio opens the door and steps down the stairs; the creaks echo off the walls with every step until he reaches the bottom, at his final step, Fabrizio felt winded. 

Once one is at his old age, they'd need to take a moment to breathe, but this night was of too much importance. Fabrizio is approaching his older years, about seventy-seven, and his stature is tall, with an average build; his hair is a coffee brown, which does not age, unlike his body. Once dedicated to being a man of the cloth, he was, but after an altercation with a demon in his early life, he devoted his life to hunting down the demon who stripped him of his faith. After exercising most of Italy, battling werewolves in Romania, and reversing Gypsy curses from France to Poland, he had found the time to end his days fighting the darkness and descend into his own end.

Fabrizio flips a switch to turn on a light above a heavy cell door at the other side of the basement. The door was highly irregular compared to the rest of the area, although it had been so empty, it had stuck out from the surrounding concrete walls and dirt floor. There were no openings, and it resembled the door of an isolation tank in prison. The only opening was accessible only from the outside and was only wide enough to see a pair of eyes. Fabrizio brought a chair that sat in what seemed to be the only dark area of the basement, brought it to the front of the door, and shifted the eye hole open. He walks back to the chair and looks at the door,

""I was nineteen when I started to learn the good book. When I was growing up, my parents fell on hard times and struggled to parent effectively. But I began reading the Bible and sought to find purity and godliness in man. Some odd years later, I had been granted residency in Italy for one of their many cathedrals. One late night, I was attending the church and started picking up after the last mass when a young woman walked in. That night, there had been a terrible storm, so bad that it was only right to dismiss the mass early because the church had almost flooded. But she seemed to be perfectly dry. I bid her a good evening, but she ignored me. She walked into the confessional, and I walked into the booth on the other side."" A low, heavy boding growl had emerged from the darkness inside the cell and rumbled through the door.

""I stared through the divider just watching her and asked if I was able to help her, ""For this is the house of God and all who repent may be absolved of their sin."" The growling had come to a stop, and earthly stomps approached the door, and a voice bellows,

""And what did she say, Favvy?""

Fabrizio had been frozen with fear, but realized he could relax, because he posed more of a threat to the demon behind than the beast to him. ""Well, she had asked for forgiveness and said her last confession had been a month ago. So I asked her what sin she had been asking forgiveness for, to which she said it was the murder of a priest. She lunged through the dividing wall and pushed me through the booth. We fought on the church floor, she bit off my ear and some of my fingers, until I grew angry and struck her in the heart with the cross of my rosary.""

The voice lowered its aggression and spoke to Fabrizio, ""Oh, Favvy, we all make mistakes; you did the right thing. The poor girl couldn't handle my possession anyway."" The demon wholeheartedly laughed, and Fabrizio was quiet. He got up and dug a key from the pocket of his slacks. ""That night is when I devoted my life to tracking you down, and within my dark journey throughout my years was only to damn you back to hell from where you've come from."" The demon shifted to the peephole and peered with his glowing reptile-like eyes. ""And all those gypsies had big mouths, which I will punish after I’m done with you!"" Fabrizio held the key to the door and spoke with assurance, ""Demon, tonight, I will let you free to accompany me for some whiskey, dinner, and cigars. I have decided that it is time for me to lay myself to my final rest. I am too old to live on, you continue possession not just on me but in my home, we settle tonight in peace so you can take me to the after, and you may be free."" The demon raised an eyebrow and questioned Fabrizio's intention.

""You want me? To drink and eat with my captor and accompany you before suicide?""

""It is not suicide that will end me but your passage into the underworld, or wherever it is that you have come from, after battling creatures and evil like you, then I could only see darkness as my peace.""

The demon lets out an intrigued sigh and peers back through the peephole.

""I'll tell you what, Favvy, you've got yourself a deal. Then I can return the favor of hosting you in my domain, for all eternity."" Fabrizio grasps the key and yells back to the demon, ""Your wicked trickery and sickness will no longer hold me prisoner in my own home; the nightmares, the sounds, the visions! And it was all because of you! So, you win, but I go on my terms, and that is peacefully.""

""Alright, alright, fine, whatever you say, Favvy. We'll go where you want to go; it just goes to show that the boogeyman was too much for your old self."" Fabrizio had said nothing but began reaching for the lock. The room had been silent this whole time, but Fabrizio could hear the wind building around him; it felt like it was rushing past his ears and swirling around him. The wind, like a vacuum, receded into the cell room and blew the heavy steel door open. Fabrizio was struck and flew into the wall on the other side of the basement. He felt the impact but was not inflicted with pain. He lay still, not out of fear, but some invisible force kept him pressed to the floor. Fabrizio managed to turn his head toward the open cell; the door had swung open and unhinged, causing it to hang to one side. The air had been thin, but suddenly it was filled with footsteps. The steps had gotten closer to Fabrizio and grown louder, CLIP-CLOP, CLIP-CLOP.

The steps grew closer, and a match had struck itself to light a now appearing cigar. Fabrizio's body was lifted from the ground, lifted like a rag doll, and kept his head straight toward the floating cigar. The invisible figure had gotten closer and drawn the cigar to its mouth, blowing smoke into Fabrizio's face. The smoke had cloaked Fabrizio entirely and sent him through a now-formed tunnel of smoke, and a light appeared at the end of the tunnel. Fabrizio approached cautiously and walked toward the light. The closer he drew, the more he was able to figure out what made the light. He got to the end and, before he knew it, had realized it was the doorway back to his kitchen. Fabrizio entrusted the familiar surroundings and walked through. The kitchen light was on but started to flicker; it shuddered, then glowed brighter.

""How do you know you're not already dead?"" The demon's voice broke the dead air and emerged from the darkness. The figure walked around Fabrizio and took the seat across from him. ""Well, for one, I know you like to torture your victims on any chance you find. But I present what your believers do whenever they need their evil to cease, as a matter of peace and a celebration of the beginning to my end. I know you are a taker of souls and judge humankind, but the work keeps the peace. Just as mine had kept peace from the likes of you; hellfire, lust, goblins, werewolves, gypsy vampires, and it took all that to get to you. So I see then, as I see now, that there was only ever darkness whenever I needed light.""

The demon sat back and peered through the shadow covering his face; his attire was from an earlier era, almost Prohibition-like, and his demeanor seemed grimly approachable yet with hidden, dangerous intent. The demon's hands lost their humanity toward his fingers; they grew longer than the average man's, as if one finger was sewn to another at the knuckle; his nails were gray, practically dead-like, and serrated like shark's teeth.

""Well, sorry to burst your bubble, Favvy, but there is light and a god. But he did not choose you; the moment of your downfall, Hell inherited your soul. That night, I attacked you, in possession of that sweet girl; it was supposed to be the end of your life.""

Fabrizio got up from the table; he sensed the conversation had not been hostile but almost a confession. ""Would you mind if I switched on a light? My eyesight is not what it once was.""

""If you do, then I must change form. How would you like to see me?"" Fabrizio turned toward the demon, and the creature peered back into eye contact; ""Just as a regular man, because of you, I was never able to call someone a friend. The life of chasing your wretched soul left me lonely to my death.""

Fabrizio leaned over and flicked the switch; within the blink of an eye, the creature morphed into the younger Fabrizio, Padre Fabrizio.

""You know what they say, the best kind of company is your own."" The demon had kept its demented eyes and demon hands; it seemed that being away from other souls had diminished its ability to form fully. The creature poured a glass of zinfandel for Fabrizio and himself. ""Ya'know? The only thing I liked about Italy was the wine; everything else I had done was purely business, and after encountering you, well, let's say I found another favorite thing about it.""

Fabrizio had started to cook the dinner, a thick seafood alfredo with a rosemary seasoning,
Fabrizio drained the pasta and poured the sauce into the pot. 

The demon spoke in an amused tone, ""My friend, you know your way around the stove. Why hadn't I smelled a delicacy like this, while imprisoned in the shoe box I called home?""

""Probably because I had no occasion to cook, being alone for so many years, there had not been a chance for company, and I do not think I would be able to explain your growls and moaning from the basement, it sounded like a dog in pain."" The demon slammed the table and growled an insult in Latin; this did not frighten Fabrizio. At one point, it was all he heard at night. ""So whenever I was hungry, I left this haunted place for a soup kitchen in town, I washed bowls afterwards, and tried to be out as late as possible."" 

The demon had sat back and listened to Fabrizio; he finished his glass and lit a cigar. ""Do you know my name, Fabrizio? I think if we are sharing it all one last time, I'd like to be called by my name instead of Demon or Creature, it is very annoying."" Fabrizio set out the utensils and placed two plates on the table, set out napkins, and sat across from the demon.

""Your name is Nefario, commonly known as the Shadow Man, judgment demon for the devil, and tasked to pass judgment on humans through dreams and premonitions. Worshippers offer what I do tonight; to rid you of your torment or to ask you for your judgment on their enemies.""

Fabrizio took a couple of bites of Alfredo, and Nefario only sipped his wine, 

""Do not forget the possessions, which is a big no-no in the Fire Man's book."" Nefario chuckled and flashed a sharp grin.

Fabrizio had patted his mouth clean and placed the napkin on the side of his plate, ""And you were tasked to seek me out, why? Out of the billions of people on holy Earth?"" Nefario had taken a couple of bites of Alfredo and picked his bottom teeth with the fork.

""That's exactly why Favvy, because you think this land is holy, the lies and sins that man commits must all be punished, because your judgment is too soft. I had to make you kill that girl to make you impure and only worthy of the gates of hell-"" Nefario reached and grabbed Fabrizio's hands, lunged forward, and stared into his eyes. Fabrizio had seen him in this light before, once when he had to push him back into the cell after one of his tricks; those yellow eyes had now turned red, and the creature's pupils widened so much that Fabrizio could make out his own reflection.

""SINCE YOU KILLED HER, YOU NO LONGER HOLD A PURE SOUL! YOU WILL BURN BECAUSE YOUR GOD NO LONGER HOLDS FAITH IN YOU!""

Stiff. Frozen. Almost dead, Fabrizio could only stare back, for he had witnessed and vanquished all dark forces; for that, this did not faze him either. He could only see this reaction as no more than a child's tantrum than a threat.
""For that is his judgment, then it shall be his will.""
They both remained sitting and staring at each other for what seemed like hours, and in this moment, Fabrizio noticed that Nefario's eyes had lost their rage, like a candle being snuffed out. 
For the next thirty minutes, it was quiet. Fabrizio finished his food while Nefario only stared at him. 

He put out the cigar hanging from his mouth and collected the plates and glasses, placed them into the sink, and turned to Fabrizio. ""Well, we had our chat, I ate your food and drank your wine. I think it is about time to finish up the arrangement.""
Fabrizio had stood from the chair and pushed the chair tucked under the table, ""You might be right, Nefario, you just might be right."" Fabrizio walks into the hallway toward his front door, and behind him, the kitchen light turns off. Fabrizio was no longer afraid; he hummed an old lullaby his mother used to sing to him. He passed underneath the hall light and exploded over his head, sending glass and sparks crashing against the walls and Fabrizio's shoulders. Fabrizio had kept walking and came to the front door, 

""My fate does not end with you, for this conversation was to make amends to my creator and finally be accepted back into his grace. I banish you, demon, back to the hell you came from."" 

Fabrizio turns the doorknob and immediately burns his hand. Fabrizio had not reacted but only looked at the burn on his palm, and the burn had branded him with a pentagram.
Fabrizio begins to cry; a tear falls onto the burn and sizzles into mist. Out of thin air, a grandfather clock begins to ring its bell. The bells ding and ring throughout the house; they fill Fabrizo's home and his consciousness. Fabrizio cries, wails, then lets himself fall to the ground and lies in a fetal position.

A slow chuckle builds in his throat; almost uncontrollably, Fabrizio begins to laugh, but not in amusement, but in fear. His laugh begins to occur maniacally, and he gets up from the floor and begins to walk down the hallway to the basement door, he stumbles and grabs onto the doorway; the door had been opened for him, and his laugh grew louder and developed into shouts as he walked toward the opening cell door in the basement, fire begins to build and erupt out of the cell. Fabrizio tries to fight whatever power is pushing him into the inflamed cell. Fabrizio's laugh continued, but tears and expressions around the grin showed his terror at the fire about to consume him, but he stopped. Staring into the eye of hellfire, he sees damned souls screaming and wailing from their torment. Fabrizio started to breathe heavily in a panic, and a cold pair of hands grabbed the back of his neck,

""Your soul IS MINE!!""

Fabrizio is thrown into the cell. The door swung shut, and the house lights popped. Now, the house was quiet. All noise ceased, and the air had died with Fabrizio.

1pqtc4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/McBeeDynasty/comments/1pqtc4e/allie_eklund/,Allie Eklund,"I think by now anyone with a brain can see how desperate for limelight she is and how performative, curated and disingenuous her posts are.

There’s evidence that two months ago, Steve Jr. was still sliding into girls DMs, yet they make a post mere weeks later that “they’ve never been so sure.” Mind you, Steven said on his podcast that their first date felt like he met his future business partner, not romantic partner. That should tell you all you need to know about their relationship. 

Allie attends Bravocon, being photographed, having never been on the show yet and while the other two, who have been around for years, are a wife, fiancee and mothers of the children are no where to be found.

Allie posts the brothers and acts as though she has this deep, strong bond with Jesse and Cole … Even referring to herself as an aunt and stating she has loved watching Cole grow as a father (you’ve literally probably have been around him less than 10 times).

Allie sets up a photo shoot of her and Steven weeks into them dating and then blasts the pictures all over social media … Also, oddly similar to photos him and Calah have taken in the past. 

Allie inserts herself into the businesses, putting her name and photograph front and center on a business she did not build nor has a connection to. I’d be wildly offended if I were Kacie or other Ali. Why does the GIRLFRIEND of two months get to be included and featured on a Christmas card attached to the business? Why does her name appear before Steve’s? Why when people are posting their meat PR packages, only Allie is tagged? And why can’t Kristi see through this bullshit?

Allie makes an IG account of Sitka, and nonstop posts about how the dog is soooooo attached to her, their bond with one another and how she’s Sitka’s “mom.” Again, desperate, cringy and disingenuous. 

Allie pretends she’s SUCH A RANCH GIRL! trying to show she belongs here. Posting herself driving a pick-up truck, holding chickens and smoking cigars. Also making sure it’s known her daddy owns a Texas ranch … Girl, I doubt you have ever actually shoveled animal shit, been hunting and woken up at the ass crack of dawn to tend to the ranch. Her family’s ranch is nothing more than a back drop for social media content to her. It’s giving “I’m not like other girls.” 

She documents EVERY LITTLE THING, making it seem as though she’s entrenched with this family, giving the appearance that she has known them forever. Prior to Steve Sr. going to prison, she posted numerous stories of him making her coffee and his “world famous omelette” … I’m sure that was maybe the second time they had met. 

My point is, she’s trying to win over the audience by attempting to convince us she’s everything Calah wasn’t - can do ranch life, is super close with the family, can generate income & be part of the business … When in reality it’s all a fucking facade.

At the end of the day, she’s a girl who grew up extremely wealthy and privileged. She’s dated famous athletes, comedians and has lived adjacent to that sphere for a long time. She’s been married and divorced, but fails to address that part of her life. She’s high maintenance and plastic, supported by her social media posts - nonstop facials, laser treatments, massages, botox, blowouts, nail appointments, hair extensions … Not to mention the stuff she doesn’t highlight - nose job, boob job, filler, etc. She hasn’t had to work in the way most people do. She doesn’t work a 9-5, she doesn’t commute daily. She doesn’t answer to a boss and she doesn’t make an average US salary. She gets paid to play dress-up at Aritizia, post social media content for products, and do photo shoots. She gets to go on constant trips, shopping sprees and enjoy luxuries like facials, massages, personal trainers, on & on. Yet she claims she hustles and has the “heart of a lion.” It’s giving Mikayla’s Nogueria’s infamous, “try being an influencer for a day.” Good for her for having that life, but don’t act like you’ve crawled your way to the top with blood, sweat and tears. Her & Steven are not compatible at the end of the day. His life has been and always will be in Galatin and that will never change because that’s where the ranch is. As much as she wants to paint herself as a farm country girl at heart, she is not and will never be. I mean for fucksake, she gets numerous coffees every time so she can “try all the flavors,” when most of us get ourselves coffee out as a treat … She’s not a ranch girl. She’s a vapid influencer. 

What is most insufferable is not who she is (which is pretty insufferable) but it is her not owning what she is. She cannot trick people into thinking she’s exactly what Steve needs. What Steve needs is a genuine, lowkey, supportive girl who is not with him for money or Bravo fame, who is content living their life in Missouri and eventually helping raise a family out there for the remainder of her life, while understanding what it takes to run a ranch - he should take notes from his brother’s partners. They are regular people, who work regular jobs and would be with Jesse and Cole with or without a television show on Bravo. I can’t even imagine what Kacie and Ali truly think of other Allie, they cannot be more opposite and it’s very insulting how this girl is portraying that her role in the Mcbee’s life is front and center and the most interesting thing about them. 

Calah has her faults, but she was at least liked by most of the audience and relatable because she didn’t try and pretend to be someone she was not and she never tried to hide her true intentions. 

I’ve just truly have had enough of this chick, their two month “relationship” and her starvation to be famous and well known and season 3 hasn’t even aired yet. I wonder if we’ll see the true feelings of the McBee clan towards her play out on screen … They can’t be as fooled as Jr. by this thirsty Temu Calah. ",25,1766170893.0,McBeeDynasty,9,0.93,False

Fast forward to today, and late this morning. Lying down and felt that characteristic burning pain in my upper abdomen. I've also felt these same burning sensations in my chest, all over my chest in fact, like heartburn, but not quite. I am still feeling it now (although not quite as bad as this morning).

Is this a gastritis flare up? I've been really upset and despondent today, I don't get it, don't understand why this has happened.

I went the hospital last month and after bloods etc doctor there said likely gastritis. More recently my GP has prescribed famotedine but I can't pick it up from the chemist until Monday. She said if this doesn't work (I had to stop omeprazole due to side effects) then she'd refer me for endoscopy. Which is scaring the life out of me.

I already have chronic health anxiety and this has been dialled up to 11 this last month that I've been struggling with this. I don't know how to combat this. I've changed my diet, no spicy/acidic/heavy foods, no coffee, just water and some chamomile tea.

1pqt9as,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roblox_EmpireClash/comments/1pqt9as/the_big_map_with_horses/,The big map with horses.,"I got teleported to another server after my team won and I became an overseer thief.

 Our team was actually the smallest, which means it wasn't the best idea to cause any conflict with other nations at the moment, so the king ordered us to focus on economy after he a citizen advised him on doing so.

There weren't any hunting rifles in the capital, so I just took a war scythe with me. I figured I could just buy a gun in another teams base.

I trekked all the way to the red capital and used the sneak tunnels to get inside. We were actually allied with them and even had a trade agreement, but I figured that won't last long.

So I stayed there for days while disguised as a redcliff peasant, gathering info and buying all their healing food and coffee.

Eventually, a blue soldier showed up and asked the red king to join them in their fight against the empyrium, who they've been fighting ever since I joined the server. They also formed a protection pact.

I immediately hid and told my team team about it.

After a bit, I found myself stuck between the redcliff gates after I fell off a wall. I couldn't escape because my team didn't have connected borders with redcliff, so I had to wait until a red citizen opens it for me.

I decided to disguise as a blue peasant, and pretend I'm just a lowly noob who got lost. It worked surprisingly, after a bit of spinning to get someone's attention, a red soldier showed up and opened up the gates. 

I figured it'll be too suspicious if I tried to switch into a red peasant again, so I decided to get out of their and make my way to the empyrium and disguised as a hunter.

The empyrium had only one territory left and that was their tree house capital.  And so I joined the red and blue soldiers there and sneaked inside to check things out.
 
While the empyrium did a fine job defending their capital, they were soon overwhelmed, and eventually, red took it over.

I decided to listen in to the soldiers conversation and found them discussing attacking the overseers, which is my team. And so I told my team via chat. But I accidently forgot to switch to team chat and I ended up saying it in disguise chat. Thankfully, Noone noticed, I thought I was done for.

I stayed behind in the treehouse after the red and blue army left, which I regretted  because I then realized I could assassinate the red king once they wage war.

So I left the treehouse and tried to follow them, but since most of them were cavalry on horseback, I ended up losing them all.

So I went to rekigrad instead, which was owned by the redcliffs.

In rekigrad was the blue king, along with a blue cavalryman on horseback. They asked why I was there, but I ignored them and pretended I couldn't use chat. 

They were the only ones there, so when they left, I quickly informed my team that blue might betray redcliff. 

Not long after, a redcliff cavalry man showed up, and at the same time, redcliff and korblox waged war on the overseers.

The blue king and his horse driver are both facing away from me, they're not moving. I had the perfect shot.

I pulled out my hunting rifle, and fired at the korblox king. 

""This player has diplomatic immunity.""

Ah, crap.

He was an ambassador, and now his cuirasseer is  barreling towards me with his lance. He killed me.

I respawned as a hunter.

My team managed to make peace with redcliff, but it didn't take long for their truce with us to have a timer again.

I discovered a fellow hunter in the jousting area. I got suspicious of him, so I hit him with my hunting rifle.

It said, ""cannot attack friendly players"".

""Friendly players"", instead of saying ""teammates"".

I figured it was a red thief because when I shot him on the head, his disguise didn't break and he didn't die.

I called him out on it, but he kept denying. 
The conversation went like this:

Me: you're a red thief!

Thief: no im not.

Me: it said friendly player and not teammate.

Thief: nope.

Red suddenly allies us.

Thief: see?

Me: can a warden arrest this guy?

So I called a warden, which made him retreat back into his sneaky, which happened to be in the jousting area. He was eventually arrested by the warden.

I requested for the warden to appoint me as a deputy, so I could catch any more thieves who try to sneak in. 

There ended being no other thieves, but I did arrest a redcliff soldier who tried to get past the front gate.

I went to check on him and apperantly he only came to get some food because he was starving. I felt sorry for the guy, so I gave him some bread.

Anyway, after we allied with red, our army started helping them fight Korblox because I guess Korblox did end up betraying them.

In the end, Redcliff had the winning countdown and I was appointed the throne.

We were still the team with the least players, so we weren't confident in winning against them, so I sent a letter to one of their citizens to not attack us. 

And then, I told my team that we weren't the win.

I decided to donate a bunch money into the treasury, so that my team can at least get some money after the round ended.

Literally stopped taking lamotragine and atomextine yesterday.

Should I keep giving it time or tell doc I’m feeling off?

1pqt2fz,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1pqt2fz/mild_pain_after_rct_on_upper_molar_should_i_be/,Mild pain after RCT on upper molar — should I be worried?,"I had a cavity in an upper molar and my dentist suggested a root canal. The treatment was done over 5 appointments.

On the first day, she took an X-ray, drilled the tooth, and put a temporary filling. From the second appointment onward, she started cleaning the canals. During those sessions, she kept asking if I felt pain — and I actually did. It felt sharp and pinching, not just pressure. I told her multiple times.

Even during the final cleaning appointment, I was still feeling pain and told her clearly. She said there couldn’t be any nerve left, that if there was a nerve she’d see blood, and that the pain was probably in my head or that I was overreacting. But I honestly was in real pain while she was working. I kept telling her but she dismissed it, mostly there was no pain but sometimes I did feel pain, And she said all is good now. 

After that, the crown was placed.

About a month later, I started noticing:

Slight but noticeable pain/sensitivity when I drink hot coffee or eat hot food

The feeling lingers for a bit, then goes away

Mild discomfort when I press on the tooth or bite hard. Or else all fine

No swelling, no pus, no fever


I thought an RCT tooth shouldn’t react to heat at all, so this confused me.

I went back to the same dentist. She checked and said everything looks normal. She adjusted my bite a little, saying it might be due to a bite issue, but the heat sensitivity is still there.

It’s now been about 1.5 months since the RCT. The pain isn’t severe — it’s mild — but it’s definitely there.

I’m trying to understand:

Is it normal for an upper molar to still have heat sensitivity after RCT?

Could a canal have been missed?


Would seeing an endodontist or getting a CBCT make sense?


I can’t afford retreatment right now, so I’m also trying to understand how risky it is to wait if the pain stays mild.

Any advice or similar experiences would really help.

I have ADHD/OCD. Which unfortunately, is one of the root causes as to why I tend to get limerence every now and then.

The half of a year my limerence has been a regular barista I see a few times a week.

However I’m mindful of it. I meditate and practice mindfulness all the time and know when my feelings and thoughts are being irrational. 

I’ve never hit on her or ever really had a conversation with her in the past year and a half since I started going. I wouldn’t even know her name, or any of the baristas names really, had I not heard call each other by name or if some of them had not come out in my people you may know on FB. 

But my barista has been acting cold with me. For a while she was very nice, which added to my limerence. Don’t worry, I’m aware she was being customer service friendly. But yeah she would try to guess my order, smiled when I went I went up, would point at me and be “hmmm what can I get for you this time” and would say good day”. Overall bubbly. 

But now she puts on a serious demeanor when I go up to order (when friendly with others) , doesn’t really say good day, overall puts on a serious face and that customer service friendliness is gone. 

Now I’m scared I had done something that creeped her out but I couldn’t possibly know what. What sucks about being neurodivergent is that you think you’re acting normal until someone tells you “why are you behaving oddly”. Again I’ve never really conversed with her, or any of the baristas.

Look this place is the best coffee in town, and the last thing I would ever want to is make a barista uncomfortable on the regular. My limerence is just that, my internal battle. I feel guilty that she made think I’m a creep. Internally, maybe so, externally, I always make sure not let my ego/thoughts/feelings get the better of me. I’d like to think I’m more rational than that despite my OCD. I wish I didn’t have limerence believe me but I do. 

They often say women sense men’s behavior so well and now I’m scared this barista can sense my limerence and make her feel unease. 

How can I go nuclear and make things feel at ease when I’m in the building?

It was then that Theo felt Captain Tanhkmet's presence before her.

A thick band of calm maroon flame formed above his forehead, dark like wet earth. The plates of his armor took on some of the same reddish-brown hue, tinting the steel's gunmetal gray. His massive shield warmed, then luminesced, soon a singular slab of coffee-colored fire. And a faint but certain hum filled the air, like the remains of note from a great gong, though the tone never diminished as would fading echoes from such an instrument.

A handful of other soldiers assembled around the town square cast casual glances toward the captain, made aware of his presence just the same. But they were quick to retrain their focus back into their rifles' sights, ignoring the sudden sensation of that new presence. They'd seen and felt that vis many times before. Only Theo stared, transfixed. 

That close, she felt her stance as solid and firm as though her back was pressed against a retaining wall of deep-dug earthworks. Her boots grew weightier, although she lifted one and realized doing so took no more effort than usual. The wind itself seemed to lessen, as if halted in surprise of Tanhkmet's sudden imposition upon the world.

""You three ready?"" asked the Captain

Theo blinked, returning to reality, then nodded, gripping her revolver. 

She was about to clear a building with the Captain of the Imperial Guard, himself, she realized. She very well might be following him into a firefight. 

""Alright. Stay close.""

Tanhkmet squared up against the front door of the farmhouse. With Krion on his left, and Junius to his right, he raised one leg, leaning back, then brought his weight down beside the knob.

The rotten wood of the farmhouse door came apart like unfired clay. The middle bowed, rather than splintering, as it was kicked to the ground, while other smaller clumps of spongy mush splattered away. The hinges and lock came free from the wall as if secured there by thread. 

Tanhkmet rushed forward, shield raised, carrying on in the same motion as his kick. His two lieutenants followed, Theo a step behind them, each aiming down the sights of the pistols into the dark interior.

Spores of mildew billowed, then stilled. The low hum of Tanhkmet's vis filled the interior. 

Theo kept her aim on one corner of the dark room even with her revolver lowered so as not to sweep those ahead of her with its muzzle. Holding her breath, she made ready for some cloaked anarchist to lunge into open doorway's new light.

Seconds passed, with no such ambush sprung. As Tanhkmet shuffled forward behind his shield, she could see the hovel's first floor appeared vacant of any enemy.

""Krion, keep your sights on the stairs. Belisarion, stay back and alert. Junius, let's check that, there,"" said Tanhkmet, gesturing to what looked like a closet or pantry.

""Aye, sir.""

Theo stared down the sights of her weapon as her eyes adjusted to the darkness. Wood splintered again, the sound dryer and less rotten than before.

""All clear down here. Belisarion, what are you getting?"" Tanhkmet called back to her.

Theo ventured further inside as Tanhkmet returned to guard the base of the stairs, facing his shield toward any threat from above. Once again positioned safely behind him, she flickered her vis, and green light mixed with the faint red-brown cast by Tanhkmet's power. 

At once, small yellow flakes scattered on the floor by the stairs tugged at her, oozing embers of green flame that drifted up toward her crown. She fell into a squat, inspecting the trace of her quarry.

""Right here. Looks like bits of straw… same signature as the doll,"" she reported. ""Maybe he picked at some of its filling and kept it with him.""

 ""Very well. We can take a closer look if there's nothing to find upstairs,"" said Tanhkmet. ""Get ready. Junius, call in one of yours to watch this floor as we clear the second.""

Junius barked an order outside as Krion steeled himself, firming his grip on his pistol where it he leveled it over Tanhkmet's shoulder. The humming around the Captain's vis deepened and strengthened, and Theo could feel herself repelled away from his shield by some unseen force as he hefted in such close proximity.

Tanhkmet ducked his chin, then started swift but careful up the stairs of the farmhouse with Krion and Junius close behind, always with his massive shield facing the most likely point of ambush. Theo followed a few steps back, keeping her head down as she'd been ordered.

But as they ascended, still, no ambush came.

The second floor held two rooms, connected by a hallway. It was more cramped by half than it'd been downstairs, almost no larger than an attic, and Theo tasted the odor of mildew and rotting wood worse in the stale air. 

""Same as before. Krion, keep watch on the right, and we'll start on the left,"" instructed Tanhkmet. 

There was again a crash and the shuffle of plate metal.

Theo heard the wet crunch of rotting wood beneath Tanhkmet's boot, followed by a sob from the other room, behind the final door yet unopened.

It was not unlike a noise of the sort she'd become quite familiar in the months since she'd received her officer's saber: the wail of a young child, like one separated from their parents in the wide-open markets of Atum-Ra.




* * *




The tear-stained face of a young boy stared back at Theodora from beneath the bed of that final room. His eyes wide, and brimming with moisture. 

""It's him, sir. The sybil."" She flickered her vis once more. ""Definitely him.""

His chest seized with panicked breath, all while he remained somehow uncanny in a strange stillness, unmoving from his spot pressed against the wall.

The maroon light of Tanhkmet's vis vanished, and the humming in the air ceased, as he set aside his shield to peer underneath the wooden frame of the bed for himself. After examining the child for a moment, he returned to his feet.

""Krion, keep watch on the hall. Junius, alert the rifles outside that the enemy isn't here, likely elsewhere in the town. Have them all positioned to defend this building, if need be.""

""Aye, sir.""

""Well, Belisarion… think you can get him to come out?""

Theo hesitated, unsure. She was never good with children. But the Captain of the Imperial Guard standing over her expectantly was strong motivation at least to try.

""Uh… it's okay…"" she ventured. ""You're safe now…""

It was the kind of thing she'd have said to children lost in crowded urban markets as she tried to reunite them with their parents. But she'd no idea if that was the right thing to say to a sibylline child, as well. She reached toward him beneath the bed, and he recoiled from the brush of her fingers.

""Uh… what's your name, there?""

The boy's sobs softened.

""…Caesos,"" he replied, sniffling.

""Alright, Caesos, well... it's safe, now. You can come out, and the Captain and I will keep you safe. We'll get you back to the caretakers,"" she said.

""No!"" he screamed. ""I don't wanna go back!""

She glanced back up at Tanhkmet. His expression was ashen, but unreadable beyond that.

The boy resumed sobbing in greater force.

 ""Shhh, there, shhh. If you come with us, it'll be okay… the bad people won't be able to hurt you anymore. We'll protect you,"" she attempted once more.

""I don't want to go back… please don't make me go back.""

Footsteps climbed back up the stairs, as Junius returned. He gave the captain a curt nod.

""Help me lift the bed, commander,"" said Tanhkmet quietly. ""We can't linger here… there's no way this isn't some kind of trap. You grab him, lieutenant, and we'll get out of here.""

Theo swallowed, making herself ready.

With a heave, Tanhkmet and Junius hoisted the nearest side of the bedframe aloft. Theo stepped over to scoop the boy up as gently as she could.

She expected him to scream, and try to scramble away. But he let out only a soft, defeated whimper, and made no attempt to resist. He smelled terrible, she realized, as she gathered him into her arms.

It was then she saw he was blind. His eyes milky gray, and unfocused.

""Let's move,"" said Tanhkmet. He slung his shield back down onto his arm once more as he made for the door. 

The child nestled further into Theo's arms as she followed the captain. His tears subdued, but did not stop.

She couldn't help but feel a sudden frustration, holding him then. 

That had been too easy, hadn't it? How was she supposed to impress Captain Tanhkmet by doing no more than just carrying a child? Where were the evil anarchists for her to tackle? And the smell on the boy was truly horrible, much worse than the average commoner, like a sewer.

""Krion, we have him,"" said Tanhkmet, halfway down the stairs. ""Back on us."" 

""What's your name, son?"" Junius tried to ask the boy, as he descended behind her.

""…Caesos,"" he answered again, between stifled sobs.

""You're alright now, Caesos. You're safe. Can you tell me where the bad people are? The ones who took you here? Where are the people who took you from— from the city?"" 

""There's no one…"" the boy managed, his voice tiny and wavering.

""They're gone now, but do you know where they went? Did you hear any of their names, perhaps?"" continued Junius.

""There's no one… no one took me… I came here all by myself,"" the boy murmured tearfully. 

The gray of his blind eyes glinted in the darkness of that musty stairway.

""And there's no one… no one left…"" he said.

But his voice then was not his own. 

True silver light shimmered in his pupils, Theo saw.

""It's not safe here,"" that other voice breathed.

Then the shimmer left his eyes, and he fell limp in her arms.

Theo fell against the wall to keep from stumbling down the rest of the stairs, given the sudden change in balance. Stabilizing, she put her ear to his chest, and was glad to find his heartbeat.

""What the fuck was that?"" said Junius.

""He's fainted,"" she said.

""No, I mean—""

""Not now,"" hissed Tanhkmet. ""Out, first.""

After another step, though, Theo's legs buckled.

""Steady there, lieutenant. You're pale…""

As she struggled through the last few steps before the farmhouse front door — for a split second, she found herself in the eye of the storm. With a final moment of terrible clarity.

Nebet. Nebet is in danger.

The next instant, she sensed the most malevolent and powerful presence of vis she'd ever felt before in her life.

She first thought the aura must be originating from somewhere impossibly near, given she felt it so intense. As if its wielder were standing right in front of her. 

Tanhkmet and Junius stopped dead in their tracks at the threshold. The air hummed as Tanhkmet's band of maroon flame reappeared, and he brought his shield up to a full shouldered brace, as did Junius with a two-handed sword of fire navy blue, followed by a company of other presences belonging to the guards positioned outside. Less experienced, Theo manifested her vis as well if a second later, and the interior swam in the dark-green mixture of their halos.

The two veterans shared a look, eyes wide.

Without another word, the captain darted outside. Theo followed alongside Junius and Krion, as quickly as she could. 

The soldiers of the company were entrenched in makeshift barricades around the farmhouse as prepared by Junius minutes ago. A rainbow of flaming crowns filled the square, together with the raised barrels of their rifles.

Without exception, those rifles were aimed in the direction from which they all sensed that terrible enemy. 

Towards the north. The direction of Atum-Ra. 

Towards an enemy apparently still so far away as to remain unseen. Theo was blanketed in cold fear as she realized the sheer power necessary to exude a presence like that at such distance.

Every veteran in the courtyard held their breath, all together feeling the same strange pause. Like the spreading cracks of a dam, seconds before failure.

Theo saw her love Nebet in her mind's eye, then, one last time. 

An instant before the whole of the sky was white and burning and painfully, unbearably bright.

Around half an hour later a truck pulls over. I grab my gear and head for the passenger's side. ""Go ahead and throw your stuff in the back"" I hear as I'm walking up alongside the tailgate. I get to the window. Driver, ""Where you going?"" ""Mobile, AL."" ""I'm headed down to Florida."" ""Are you taking the 64/81 down?"" ""Yeah, until It hits the 77."" ""Awesome!"" ""Toss your stuff in the back."" 

I toss my gear in the back seat. Get in the front.  ""Thanks for stopping!"" ""Yeah man. I did some hitchhiking and walking when I was younger. Used to go to Dead shows all the time."" ""Sweet! I saw a bunch of shows myself years back.""

He's a few years older than I am. It was nice to talk to someone that has lived and grown up in the same era I did. We had a lot in common.

I check maps to see where I'm at and start planning an easy spot for him to drop me off. I notice the 77 will take me to Charlotte, NC, away from the mountians, and a couple hours south of where I would jump out if I stayed on the 81.

""I think I'll roll with you until Charlotte."" ""Yeah man. No problem.""

We roll down the road for a few hours. Hit traffic outside the 485 loop north of the city. I find a truck stop in the middle of town that seems to be easy-off easy-on for him. 

We hit the truck stop. He gives me a bag of homemade deer jerky we've been muching on on the way down. ""Thanks man!"" I grab my gear, say goodbye, and head inside. 

I drop my gear in the subway attached to the truck stop. Start looking for a city bus to get me out of town. I have no desire to try and urban camp in a major city.

Had to use the bathroom. It seemed to be a little sketchy in there (judging by the armed and vested security guy/cop that was there.) No homebums inside, but I'm not gambling with my gear.

Gear up. Water bottle, gloves, bag of jerky, and hoodie in one hand. The other free to navigate the door. I head for the bathroom.

Off to my left I hear, ""Are you traveling?"" I turn to look. And there stands the tallest black man I've ever seen. ""Yeah."" ""Where you comin' from?"" ""Haymarket, VA."" ""Where you headed?"" ""Down to Mobile, AL."" ""Tell you what, I was cleaning my truck out today and found this. You can have it."" He hands me twenty. ""Wow! Thanks man!"" ""You're welcome. What about a shower? Are you taking off right now or you gonna hang for a bit?"" ""I'm gonna head out on a city bus to get to the edge of town for the night.""

""Let's see if I got extra shower credits... Yep. Got eight. Let me give you my phone number. You can use it when you hit another Pilot to get a shower."" I type his number into my phone. ""Thanks man! That's huge!"" ""You're welcome. Good luck out there, and stay safe!"" ""Thank you!""

I hit the head. It's flooded. There's a guy in there cleaning up. He sees me, ""The urinals are out of order 'cause they keep floodin'"" ""Gotcha."" I squeeze my way in this tiny bathroom into a stall, backpack on, stuff in one hand. Execute one-handed relief maneuver. Back out to the tables in Subway.

Gear down. phone plugged in. I start checking city busses. It'll take two busses, for a couple hours, and a thirty-three minute walk to a Love's just outside the 485. The bus stop is a five minute walk from here. 'Perfect!'

Some screwing around on the interwebs later, it's time to go. Gear up. Out the door. Down the street to the bus stop.

I put my route in maps as I'm walking to see exactly where the bus stop is. It's about a hundred feet from me. ""Stop Canceled.""

'Fuck. 😆' Back to Subway/Pilot. Drop my gear at the same table. Start digging through maps to see what's up. There's another bus in about fourty minutes. My thiry-three minute walk has turned into a fifty-five minute walk. 'It's all part of the adventure,' I tell myself with a smile.

I catch the bus. Make my transfer. Get dropped near the edge of town. A few minutes later I'm peeling off layers.

Make it to my destination. I drop my gear and hang outside to cool off. I'm sweating. I definitely don't want to walk inside a warm building amd add to the heat coming off me. Have a smoke. I start to get cold.

Gear up. Inside. Find a table. Grab a couple burritos. Phone plugged in. I start looking for a place to camp for the next forty-eight hours. It's gonna rain tomorrow and through the night. I'm gonna be here for a minute.'

I spy a dirt road on the other side of 85 that has a house at the end of it. 'No go there.' I keep looking. There's another dirt road that looks like it doesn't go anywhere, but should be a good way to get into the trees. And it's a little closer.

Charger in pack. Phone in pocket. Gear up. Fifteen miute walk to dirt road...

The road goes up a steep but short hill. I head up. There's a tree across the road that somebody cut intentionally for that purpose. 'Nice! Don't have to worry about an vehicles coming up here.'

It took me a bit of wandering around to find a level-ish spot. Theres no way to get to me except on foot the same way I came in. Zero signs of anyone being up there recently. 'Perfect!'

Gear down. Tent up. Me and gear inside tent. Bed made. Even hung my tent light up and used it since nobody could see me. 'Pretty sweet spot.'

Yesterday...

Woke up nice and late around 9:00am to sound of rain. Chargers, headphones, and a couple random things into my small day pack. Grab my umbrella. Hoody on. Coat and gloves in hand. Off to truck stop.

Some charging. Some interwebs. Some coffee and food. 'Damn this place is expensive!' And back out to the tent. Smoke a one-hitter of some weed I brought with me, and pass out to some old Lost in Space...",52,1766170017.0,vagabond,6,0.94,False

Disclaimer: I don’t want to do extinction/CIO, but I am open to short check-ins. I used the chair method with my first baby, but I’m not sure it’s the right fit this time. I’ve been considering PLS possibly? 

My second baby is six months old and wakes 7–10 times per night. I know the two big things I need to work on/need advice on are:

1. Teaching her to fall asleep independently

2. Breaking the feed-to-sleep association

I’m a teacher and have the next two weeks off for winter break, so I’d really like to tackle this now.

She’s very small (1st percentile), so I plan to keep two night feeds. Daytime sleep is hard to track because she’s at daycare Monday–Friday. On weekends, she usually takes 3–4 naps and is awake about 2.5–3 hours between naps. The 4th nap only happens if all the earlier naps were short and she’s clearly struggling. Naps typically total about 2.5hrs per day. Bedtime is 8pm and DWT is 6/6:30am. Our bedtime routine is bath, pajamas/lotion, bottle, then crib. Occasionally she’ll go down drowsy, but most nights I’m laying her down fully asleep.

I’m completely exhausted and have been sleeping in 45-minute stretches for months. I’m not big on CIO, but I understand some fussing is part of the process. Can anyone share practical, step-by-step tips on what to do?",1,1766169940.0,sleeptrain,3,1.0,False

Tell us a bit about your Christian journey: I was baptized in 2024. Ever since then I can’t help but feel like I’m being attacked? I’ve been tested in ways I can’t explain.. now I’m moving forward completely on my own. God has placed me in a pruning season. 

What sort of person are you looking for?

I’m looking for someone who is serious about their faith. I believe in the traditional type of relationship where I can just take care of everything for her, while she stays home and focuses on us.. but I have respect for those who want to work and have no problem with that. 

I’ve reached a high point in my career and I run my own company online. I’m focused on health/fitness and being an entrepreneur. I’m looking for someone that likes my mug and genuinely wants to know me. I just want to serve my woman and build a better life for each other

Age range: F24 - 35

Would you be willing to do long distance/relocate

Yes, for the right woman I will absolutely make that effort.

From my personal experiences, I’ve been losing faith in finding someone here for me in the states.. it just feels like the hook-up culture is all that matters here. If I don’t meet someone soon I may be traveling to other countries in the near future. ",5,1766169921.0,ChristianDating,0,0.86,False

In most private spaces - let's say a phone call with a friend or while you're car pooling, or maybe whispering over some coffee at Starbucks - I think trauma dumping is perfectly reasonable.

Yes. I understand that a good trauma dump could traumatize or trigger on the receiving end but that doesn't mean we should avoid it all together. No. You don't have to ask permission.

But there is one caveat that is implied here.

The zero (sum) expectation rule: if you trauma dump - you should not have any significant expectation from the person listening to you.

You can expect that your trauma be kept as a secret, or that your friend will stay your friend. That's fine. But you can't really expect anything beyond that. Whatever that may be.

As long as we market trauma dumping with the zero expectation rule - I think we'll be fine.

1pqsrew,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pqsrew,Poker Night at the Inventory: Character Rundown,"Decided to give a rundown of each of the characters in my ""Poker Night at the Inventory"" reboot/sequel:

***Angel Dust***

A famous demon drag queen pornstar/hardcore gangster who died in the 1940s. Starring in many a raunchy film, soon realized that it was time for a change of scenery and became the first patron of the Hazbin Hotel, a place ran by the daughter of Lucifer himself, Charlie Morningstar, as a way to (hopefully) rehabilitate sinners and allow them to ascend up into heaven. Angel Dust is a carefree, crass, and lecherous spider-demon, with the twin occupations of violent gangster and drag queen porn star, who loves living off crime and vice in Hell. Except, his situation is not nearly as amazing as he pretends, and he might actually have more than just pragmatic reasons to stay at Charlie’s hotel.

Angel Dust’s strategy when playing poker basically flirt first, play second. He often uses his flirtatious acts as a way to throw off his opponents. Outside of that, he bluffs often and makes periodic bets throughout the river. Despite that, he’s very observant and a wiz at reading people.

Should it be his turn to place a bounty, Angel will choose to place one of his tommy guns. Should the player win the tommy gun, they will win the Angelic Drumgun for the Sniper in Team Fortress 2.

Should the player equip the same Hazbin Hotel themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes the titular Hazbin Hotel, with sinners roaming around the Inventory and Niffty rushing around trying to kill every bug she sees. Angel Dust will also gain a new outfit based on his get up in the episode ""Masquerade"". Doing this also unlocks new conversations regarding the staff of the Hazbin Hotel, hell itself, and shows new elimination cutscenes involving Niffty seeing a bug on the losing opponent, and being sicked onto them.

Quotes

* “Aww, look at you, putting in the big-boy chips.” - Reaction to player betting
* “Careful, sweetheart, if you bet any higher you might grow a spine.” - Reaction to player raising
* “You call *that* a raise? I’ve seen johns more threatening.” - Raising
* “Oh, honey, that bluff is see-througher than my work outfits.” - Calling a bluff
* “Heh heh, pal, I know a bluff when I see one. Call.” - Calling a bluff
* “Holy shit!” - Reaction to large bet/all in

***Zoe***

The resident eldritch horror turned fandom enthusiast of Spooky Academy. Once an eldritch horror that lived inside a totem named Z’gord, it was released and ended up being shown the wonders of high school, making it decide to live as a high school girl named Zoe. Zoe is a HUGE enjoyer of fandom culture, including fanart, fanfiction, and shipping culture (her favorite ship being Naruto X Garfield).

Zoe is a wildcard when it comes to poker. She often bets and calls randomly with abandon.

Should it be her turn to place a bounty, Zoe will choose to place her fanfic “Liam Prom”. Should the player win Liam Prom, they will win a wig based on Zoe’s hair in Team Fortress 2.

Should the player equip the same Monster Prom themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes Spooky Academy, with the school’s student body roaming the Inventory. Zoe will also gain a new outfit that is a cosplay of Garfield. Doing this also unlocks new conversations regarding Zoe’s adventures at Spooky Academy/Monster Con and shows new elimination cutscenes involving Polly Geist and Scott Howl (the PRANK MASTERZ) pulling a dangerous prank on the losing opponent.

Quotes

* “Ooooh, spicy bet! I vibe with the drama. Call!” - Calling
* “Wow, those are a lot of chips… Welp, time to do some calling!” - Calling
* “I’m investing in this narrative arc. Raise!” - Raising

* “Come on, Zoe, think of all the merch you can get… (sigh) I’m out” - Folding
* “Nope! Even the Great Old Ones would think this hand sucks.” - Folding
* “Hell ya! Zoe for the win!” - Winning the pot
* “I would like to thank probability, hubris, and dumb luck.” - Winning the pot
* “This reminds me of a tabletop RPG I played with Polly, only with fewer orgies. So far.” -Idle

***The Spy***

The shapeshifting, disappearing frenchman assassin. Cigarette in one hand, butterfly knife in the other, The Spy is an international man of mystery who deals in infiltration, deception, and psychological warfare. Whether he’s impersonating an enemy, hiding in plain sight, or backstabbing a heavy, The Spy operates with cool composure, impeccable style, and minimal effort.

When it comes to poker, the Spy is the hardest to read out of each character. He keeps his composer and usually checks and calls and doesn’t bet or raise until the end of the river. He also knows when to fold as well as when somebody’s bluffing

Should it be his turn to place a bounty, Spy will choose to place the Dead Ringer. Should the player win the Dead Ringer, they will win a special casino themed outfit for the Spy in Team Fortress 2.

Should the player equip the same Team Fortress 2 themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes 2Fort, with the tournament being held in BLU team’s intelligence room. Spy will also gain a new outfit that changes his outfit to a casino inspired get up. Doing this also unlocks new conversations regarding Spy’s battles with RED team and shows new elimination cutscenes involving the BLU Engineer firing a rocket sentry at the losing opponent.

* “If you insist on throwing your money away, I am happy to assist.” - Reaction to call/bet

* “And that, gentlemen, is why you never play against a professional.” - Winning
* “Was there ever a doubt?” - Wins a hand
* “Merde!” - Loosing
* “Do not act so cocky, you’ve only got lucky” - Lost a hand

***Sonar***

The Superhero Dispatch Network’s resident batboy/crypto bro. Once a Harvard graduate turned supervillain, Sonar orchestrated some of the biggest Silicon Valley investment frauds in US history. After being arrested, he decided to turn his life around by joining the SDN’s (Superhero Dispatch Network) phoenix program that’s dedicated to reforming.

Despite his attitude, Sonar is very calculative when it comes to poker. He tries his best to plan for every possibility, but has a tendency to be blind sided when the pot gets big enough.

Should it be his turn to place a bounty, Sonar will choose to place an SDN coffee mug. Should the player win the mug, they will win an SDN shirt and tie for the Scout in Team Fortress 2.

Should the player equip the same Dispatch themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes the SDN building, with members of Z-Team roaming the Inventory. Sonar will also gain a new outfit where he is in a detective inspired get up. Doing this also unlocks new conversations regarding Sonar’s adventures with the Z-Team and shows new elimination cutscenes involving different members of the Z-Team removing the losing opponent from the tournament.

Quotes

***Mira***

A member of the famous kpop idol group HUNTR/X. Mira acts as a famous celebrity by day, and works as a demon hunter by night, protecting Korea from vicious demons who seek to devour their souls. Mira was considered the black sheep of her family, but she eventually joined HUNTR/X in their mission to protect humanity from demons as the group’s visual expert and lead dancer.

Mira’s strategy when playing poker is basically to be as aggressive as possible. She makes bets throughout the river and is the first to call when she thinks someone is bluffing. She may even intimidate her opponents into folding with her aggression.

Me and my ex broke up 6 weeks ago after a very loving 4 year relationship. We broke up because she shut down emotionally and couldn’t handle the relationship, but told me she regretted it during the conversation 😂. There was no loss of love or attraction. Just fear. 

About 3 weeks later, I completed my first marathon and she sent me a really nice, intimate message saying she was happy for me and she knew how much dedication it took. 2 weeks later, after fighting the urges, I decided to invite her for a coffee. 

She replied: I appreciate the message and have thought about it but I don’t think it’s a good idea because I don’t want to make this harder on either of us and it’s still early from the break up. 

I feel so trapped in ambiguity. I want this to work out so much but I don’t know where her heads at. ",1,1766169449.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

1pqsn21,https://www.reddit.com/r/laos/comments/1pqsn21/just_got_back_from_an_8day_laos_trip_with_the/,Just got back from an 8-day Laos trip with the boys — here’s an honest review,"Just returned from Laos (Vientiane → Pakse → Vang Vieng → Luang Prabang) and honestly, it’s one of those trips that quietly grows on you. Not flashy, not overwhelming, but deeply satisfying.

We were a group of 5 guys, experience > luxury type, and Laos delivered exactly that.

Vientiane
Not a city you “do”, but a city you settle into. We stayed here twice and it worked well as a base. Very laid-back, almost sleepy vibes. Patuxai and the Mekong riverfront are nice for a first-day reset after international travel. Nothing mind-blowing, but calm and easy. Food is simple, cheap, and decent.

Pakse & Tad Fane (Bolaven Plateau)
This was the standout adventure day. Flew in early morning, did the Tad Fane waterfall zipline, and flew back the same evening — tiring but 100% worth it. The zipline over the waterfall is genuinely epic, not overhyped. Bolaven Plateau itself feels raw and untouched, coffee plantations everywhere, lush greenery. If you like nature and adrenaline, don’t skip this.

Vang Vieng
This is where the trip peaked for us. Stunning limestone mountains, river views everywhere, and a perfect mix of adventure + chill + chaos.
Kayaking and tubing were ridiculously fun. Blue Lagoons are epic & it was exemplified by the sudden rains making it more beautiful. Nights are lively without being trashy (unless you want them to be). It’s one of those places where you wake up and don’t feel like checking the time. Easily our favourite stop.

Luang Prabang
A perfect way to end the trip. Calm, beautiful, cultural without being boring. Kuang Si waterfalls alone justify coming here — probably one of the prettiest waterfalls I’ve seen. Night market is great for food and souvenirs. Temples, cafés, slow walks — it balances out the madness of Vang Vieng really well.

General thoughts
	•	Laos is insanely underrated
	•	People are kind and non-pushy
	•	Very affordable (food, transport, activities)
	•	Infrastructure is basic but improving (trains are surprisingly good)
	•	Not a place for luxury seekers — but perfect for travellers

If you’re someone who likes nature, simple living, adventure, and travelling with friends without rushing through checklists — Laos deserves a spot on your list.

Would I go back? Yes.
Would I recommend it over more “popular” SEA destinations? Also yes, if you’re bored of crowds and Instagram chaos.

Happy to answer questions if anyone’s planning a similar route.",14,1766169221.0,laos,1,0.94,False

1pqsmet,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pqsmet,Poker Night at the Inventory: Character Rundown,"Decided to give a rundown of each of the characters in my ""Poker Night at the Inventory"" reboot/sequel:

***Angel Dust***

A famous demon drag queen pornstar/hardcore gangster who died in the 1940s. Starring in many a raunchy film, soon realized that it was time for a change of scenery and became the first patron of the Hazbin Hotel, a place ran by the daughter of Lucifer himself, Charlie Morningstar, as a way to (hopefully) rehabilitate sinners and allow them to ascend up into heaven. Angel Dust is a carefree, crass, and lecherous spider-demon, with the twin occupations of violent gangster and drag queen porn star, who loves living off crime and vice in Hell. Except, his situation is not nearly as amazing as he pretends, and he might actually have more than just pragmatic reasons to stay at Charlie’s hotel.

Angel Dust’s strategy when playing poker basically flirt first, play second. He often uses his flirtatious acts as a way to throw off his opponents. Outside of that, he bluffs often and makes periodic bets throughout the river. Despite that, he’s very observant and a wiz at reading people.

Should it be his turn to place a bounty, Angel will choose to place one of his tommy guns. Should the player win the tommy gun, they will win the Angelic Drumgun for the Sniper in Team Fortress 2.

Should the player equip the same Hazbin Hotel themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes the titular Hazbin Hotel, with sinners roaming around the Inventory and Niffty rushing around trying to kill every bug she sees. Angel Dust will also gain a new outfit based on his get up in the episode ""Masquerade"". Doing this also unlocks new conversations regarding the staff of the Hazbin Hotel, hell itself, and shows new elimination cutscenes involving Niffty seeing a bug on the losing opponent, and being sicked onto them.

* “Oh, honey, that bluff is see-througher than my work outfits.” - Calling a bluff
* “Heh heh, pal, I know a bluff when I see one. Call.” - Calling a bluff
* “Holy shit!” - Reaction to large bet/all in

***Zoe***

The resident eldritch horror turned fandom enthusiast of Spooky Academy. Once an eldritch horror that lived inside a totem named Z’gord, it was released and ended up being shown the wonders of high school, making it decide to live as a high school girl named Zoe. Zoe is a HUGE enjoyer of fandom culture, including fanart, fanfiction, and shipping culture (her favorite ship being Naruto X Garfield).

Zoe is a wildcard when it comes to poker. She often bets and calls randomly with abandon.

Should it be her turn to place a bounty, Zoe will choose to place her fanfic “Liam Prom”. Should the player win Liam Prom, they will win a wig based on Zoe’s hair in Team Fortress 2.

Should the player equip the same Monster Prom themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes Spooky Academy, with the school’s student body roaming the Inventory. Zoe will also gain a new outfit that is a cosplay of Garfield. Doing this also unlocks new conversations regarding Zoe’s adventures at Spooky Academy/Monster Con and shows new elimination cutscenes involving Polly Geist and Scott Howl (the PRANK MASTERZ) pulling a dangerous prank on the losing opponent.

***The Spy***

The shapeshifting, disappearing frenchman assassin. Cigarette in one hand, butterfly knife in the other, The Spy is an international man of mystery who deals in infiltration, deception, and psychological warfare. Whether he’s impersonating an enemy, hiding in plain sight, or backstabbing a heavy, The Spy operates with cool composure, impeccable style, and minimal effort.

When it comes to poker, the Spy is the hardest to read out of each character. He keeps his composer and usually checks and calls and doesn’t bet or raise until the end of the river. He also knows when to fold as well as when somebody’s bluffing

Should it be his turn to place a bounty, Spy will choose to place the Dead Ringer. Should the player win the Dead Ringer, they will win a special casino themed outfit for the Spy in Team Fortress 2.

Should the player equip the same Team Fortress 2 themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes 2Fort, with the tournament being held in BLU team’s intelligence room.

* “Do not act so cocky, you’ve only got lucky” - Lost a hand

***Sonar***

The Superhero Dispatch Network’s resident batboy/crypto bro. Once a Harvard graduate turned supervillain, Sonar orchestrated some of the biggest Silicon Valley investment frauds in US history. After being arrested, he decided to turn his life around by joining the SDN’s (Superhero Dispatch Network) phoenix program that’s dedicated to reforming.

Despite his attitude, Sonar is very calculative when it comes to poker. He tries his best to plan for every possibility, but has a tendency to be blind sided when the pot gets big enough.

Should it be his turn to place a bounty, Sonar will choose to place an SDN coffee mug. Should the player win the mug, they will win an SDN shirt and tie for the Scout in Team Fortress 2.

Should the player equip the same Dispatch themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes the SDN building, with members of Z-Team roaming the Inventory.

Think Again.,"Free Speech for People writes-   ""Following Donald Trump’s loss in the 2020 election, reports began to spring up of Trump supporters gaining unauthorized access to election equipment across multiple swing states. The reports suggested that the efforts were unconnected but evidence surfaced in 2022 that indicated otherwise.

Plaintiffs in a long-standing Georgia lawsuit filed in 2017, led by the Coalition for Good Governance (CGG), uncovered evidence that the voting equipment in Coffee County, Georgia had been unlawfully accessed. CGG is an allied organization to Free Speech For People, and Susan Greenhalgh, FSFP’s Senior Advisor for Election Security is a consulting expert to the CGG plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

After obtaining evidence that the voting system was improperly accessed, CGG successfully petitioned the Court for discovery regarding the breach in the Spring of 2022. Through records, emails, texts, surveillance videos, photographs, contracts, documents and depositions produced through court discovery, the plaintiffs amassed evidence that showed that Trump attorney Sidney Powell hired computer forensics operatives to go to Coffee County, and with the cooperation of the County’s election director and GOP county chair, copied all of the software on the voting devices. The records also revealed that the Georgia voting system breach was part of a larger, coordinated plot to similarly take software from voting equipment in other states and share it with the same network of Trump allies.""

this is also a cross post from another reddit, but i did need some help/advice from people who are, you know, adults. 

i’m a high school senior turning 18 this summer, and i’m looking for general financial advice as i prepare to move out and manage my own finances. i’ve been accepted to yale university and will be moving to new haven, ct (i know it's expensive there, so that's why i'm mentioning this). 

my education is fully funded, and i plan to complete my undergraduate degree in biology with the goal of becoming an immunodermatologist (so lot's of school left </3). 

since tuition isn’t a concern, i’m mainly looking for guidance on things like which financial accounts to open and how to set myself up responsibly early on, especially as someone who will be in school for a long time. 

one of my biggest questions is whether it’s smart to work during undergrad even if i don’t need the income for the purpose of investing. any additional advice would be greatly appreciated. 

**some extra info** 

\- i 'm currently at an ECHS (early college high school) and graduate high school with my associate's degree (all my credits transfer, i will only have 2 years of my bachelor's degree before i graduate with a B.S. i'm mentioning this bc it means ill take lots of hard classes in the next two years). 

\- i am incredibly organized and productive so i think i could handle having a job in college? however, they are more difficult courses + more hours so ofc it depends but throughout high school i managed a job, stuco president + more so i think i might be capable. 

 \- i plan on minoring in chem and philosophy (more crazy credit hours there..) 

\- i plan on going to med school right after my undergrad. 

\- i have worked around 35hrs per week (more hours over breaks) since my since 10th grade year and currently have around $25k in savings. what should i do with this..?

\- i'm at around $15 an hour now working for a coffee company and have stocks as well.

\-  this figure could be higher but isn't. this is because i have pretty bad spending habits. i'm super girly and spend a lot of money on things like shoes, makeup and clothes + i go out a lot and love giving gifts/paying for strangers/etc. i'm working on it tho!! promise. 

any and all advice is appreciated so much, thank you all so much and have a wonderful day <3",3,1766169137.0,Adulting,3,1.0,False

About me: I’m gay, 27 years old, turning 28 in May. I work remotely for a tech company based in Durham, NC. Currently single and have no pets. I graduated from UNCW in 2020 and was on the gymnastics team! I use to work at Apple before finding my new job. I love traveling, being outside, going out to eat, watching movies, spending time with family and being with friends.

Who I’m looking for: A friendly roommate who is in their twenties. Young professional, clean/tidy, and has no pets (I am very clean/tidy myself). I work remotely, so I will be working from home 100% of the time. Open to someone who also works from home. Would love to be friends and cook/go out together but also okay with keeping to ourselves if preferred. 

Where I am looking: I’ve been on the upper west side during my sublease. I love it, but I am also open to other neighborhoods (West Village, West Harlem, Williamsburg, Lincoln Square, FiDi, etc). 

What I’m looking for: Two bedroom, one/two bathroom - apartment. I have furniture I can bring to fully furniture the living room (tv, couch, coffee table, etc) but it is all currently in a storage unit back in NC. I would love to find a place already furnished or re-furnish a place rather than make the trip back home and drive all my stuff here. Ideally, want rent to be $1,500 or below (per person). Also open to having 2 roommates (three bedrooms, one-two bathrooms).

When I’m looking: Move in date would be January 22nd-February 1st. Move in date is flexible it’s good match!

Please message me if you are interested or know someone who might be :)

1pqsjwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/driving/comments/1pqsjwv/former_driving_instructor_here_things_i_told/,Former driving instructor here. Things I told teenage students . . .,"1. Don't feel pressure to catch up to the car in front of you. Staying back on the road isn't like staying back in school. There's no shame.
2. Don't gravitate to the corner just because you're planning make a turn. Stay away from the corner and go AROUND it. Pretend there's a rattlesnake on the corner, and it bites tires.
3. When a green light turns yellow, will you make it before it turns red? If you have time to ponder this, you have time to slow down on yellow and stop on red.
4. Red always means stop, but green doesn't always mean go. Sometimes it means yield because someone else has the right of way.
5. Don't let gravity dictate your speed. If you're heading uphill, you must fight gravity using the gas pedal. If you're heading downhill, you must fight gravity using the brake pedal. Skiers who don't fight gravity end up in the parking lot, jammed under a car.
6. Young people have a persistent sense of urgency, and it affects driving. So pretend you're old and retired and constipated.
7. Someone is honking at you when you're doing nothing wrong? Pretend it's a goose honking. They don't know shit, but they shit on everything.
8. Glide to a stop like a train glides into the station with every passenger sipping hot coffee. Slow and smooth. Nothing jerky.
9. The most important driving skill is self-restraint. Someday there will be nobody in the passenger seat. It's one of those growing-up moments you'll never forget. You're on your own. But when you're hungry or angry or late for work, will you be able to restrain yourself, or will you end up on the news?
10. The highest level of driving is called BORING. It's not like sports, where the best athletes do dramatic stuff. It's the opposite. The best drivers do nothing interesting. It's anticlimactic but true.
11. Failing to look and failing to signal are the two most common reasons for failing the road exam. So when you practice your maneuvers (parking on a hill, three-point turn, reversing straight, parallel parking), your turn signal should be on basically the whole time, and your neck should be sore from looking over your shoulders constantly.
12. The road examiner might have an ominous tone, but don't crumble. You might be doing fine. Some of them keep kids on edge the whole time, but then they're generous with pass/fail in the end.
13. Driving is like shooting pool. Think a couple moves ahead.
14. Don't zip alongside a row of parked cars as if nothing can go wrong. Lots can go wrong. Doors fly open. Dogs, strollers, joggers, elders can suddenly emerge from between the cars. And a row of slow cars on the highway is no better. Someone is bound to get frustrated and jump into your lane. Get your reflexes ready.
15. If you fail your road test, your life isn't over. Just hold your head down at the dinner table for a few days, then retake the test. I failed my first one, but now I'm a driving instructor.
16. Some people have their turn signals on by accident. So don't assume they're going to turn into your street and just pull out in front of them.
17. Driving at night isn't so bad. Road markings and signs and traffic lights and brake lights are more obvious, the sun is never in your eyes, you get a warning about approaching cars because you see headlights coming, and there are fewer cars and pedestrians to worry about.
18. Driving on the highway isn't so bad. Everyone is going in the same direction. There are no intersections or traffic lights or pedestrians. Practice on a weekend morning. Get on, go down one exit, get off.
19. If a cop pulls you over, don't cry and don't get cocky. Both are suss behavior. Just be humble and cooperative.
20. Driving on snow or ice isn't so bad. Go to a quiet place and hit the brakes hard, to see how much traction you've got. Drive accordingly. Every input (steering, gas, brake) needs to be smoother and gentler than normal, and don't forget number 1 above. Don't catch up to the car in front of you.

1pqse19,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1pqse19/so_much_loss_in_two_months_please_dont_forget_to/,"So much loss in two months, please don't forget to take care of yourself!!!","I am going to sound hypocritical because I am unsure, I will continue to take care of myself. But those of you who can, please don't forget yourself. In two months, I quit eating. I have been eating maybe once a week. I have lost 50 pounds and weigh like 110 which is extremely unhealthy for me. I also realized I wasn't bathing. I think I bathed twice in a month. Grief is terrifying, I honestly forgot to do basic hygiene. It never crossed my mind because all I think off is the losses of the last two months. I have curly hair and only brush it when I shower. Well, I wasn't bathing and I have a huge clump of matted hair on the side of my head. I am too ashamed and embarrassed to see a hairstylist and deal with judgement. I just can't. My only support system is my boyfriend. I live 2,500 miles from family. Our relationship is on and off again. Luckily, I was staying with him two days ago or I don't know what would have happened.

 I woke up yesterday, I felt fine, he was still in bed. I went to the bathroom, I remember turning off the lights and thinking okay let's go make coffee. I remember nothing after that. When I ""woke"" up, I was lying down, my boyfriend was shaking me and practically screaming and I was terrified. I had no idea what was going on. He went into the other room, and I could hear him freaking out which freaked me out. What we think happen is I fainted in the dining room. There's a blood trail to the living room. I think I was trying to get to the couch because if I get dizzy which does sometimes happen, I lay down. There was a pretty big blood pool in the living room, which makes us think I fell again. He has a back problem and can't just jump out of bed. He heard the noise and called to me and I didn't answer. He was starting to get up when he said I came through the bedroom door. I think I was trying to get to him. He said i was trying to grab something to hold but there's nothing there but walls and he was asking me what is going on, are you okay? I fainted again right in front of him. I remember none of this. I have a deep laceration on my chin somehow and he took me to the ER. The doctor immediately asked me, you have not been eating, have you? I asked how he knew, and he said there's a certain smell on your breath from when your body starts eating itself. That freaked me out. And made me self-conscious because I didn't brush my teeth before I went lol. Here is what happened over the last two months.

I've been blessed in the fact that I had never experienced grief before. In October, my three-year-old labradoodle died suddenly. There were no warning signs. I had an autopsy done on him and he had cancer. Even if I had known, they said it was too late. Even in his final days, he was such a happy guy. I just can't believe there were no signs and he was only 3. It hit me hard.

I know this page is about loss, but I want to add this part in here because it has affected me immensely. At work, they dropped my hours in half. I was one of two full time employees and the company got bought out by private equity two months before. When my manager refused to fix it, I went to HR. Huge mistake. They didn't respond for weeks and during those weeks, I worked with the same four people, 2 supervisors, 2 assistant managers. They all started targeting me, harassing me, discriminating against me for my PTSD (they only knew because I had disability leave), and retaliating against me. My store manager refused to do anything. I didn't want to go to HR because they did nothing about my hours, so I filed an official complaint of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. I never heard back from them until a couple weeks ago, long after I left the company and was told the case was investigated and closed. They never spoke to me and there was no way to contact them or I would have. My district manager showed up one day to speak to me about the HR complaint of my reduced hours, which is protected under the Labor and Industries Minimum Wage Act....I didn't know that at this time. She asked if I had health insurance through them, I did not. She tells me they don't have full time employees, which is a lie, and demotes me to part time. I am in shock, but my main concern is this discrimination, it is affecting me obviously. I ask if she's there to discuss that as well. She had no idea what I was talking about. I could see that she was angry, and she dismissed me.

 The very next day, my store manager tried placing me on an unattainable PIP, there was no way I would pass it. She said it was due to my performance. I asked her how so, we just did our yearly performance reviews and I did great. I also have no verbal or written warnings. I met the store's goals myself by the middle of the month.  It quickly hit me this was retaliation for going to HR about my hours, and the discrimination complaint that I repeatedly brought to her attention, and she did nothing about. I quit citing constructive dismissal. There was no way I could go back to work in an intolerable working environment where my supervisors, managers, store manager, district manager, and HR were all against me. I filed for unemployment; they are fighting it. I have not been paid. I've also filed with the EEOC but that takes a long time and have been talking to an employment attorney who advised me to get my records from work. Interestingly, they said they do not provide performance reviews. I have copies, well screenshots. They ignored my request twice, I emailed them after I received the information to provide my reason for leaving, my disability leave, and all HR communication. Just completely ignored it, not even to say they do not provide it. I have copies of those, just screenshots. So, this has been a nightmare.

The week after I lost my job, my mother called and said my grandmother was in the hospital. She had COPD for twenty years and it was not uncommon for her to go to the hospital. A few days later, my mom informed me my grandmother was entering hospice. We were all in shock, she had seemed okay and hadn't been to the hospital in a while, and it just happened so fast. Within three days she passed. I have so many regrets. Not seeing her enough, calling her, etc. I've been absorbed in grief.

A few weeks ago, my 10-year-old English bulldog all of a sudden could barely get up and walk. I still remember my final night with him; I was taking him to the vet in the morning. He did not make it. The house is eerily quiet; I cry all the time. I miss the sound of doggie toenails on the floor as they walk. ",1,1766168634.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

1pqscu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Delusional_At_Best/comments/1pqscu0/bus_ride_through_thoughts/,Bus Ride Through Thoughts,"I’m on a Seattle bus heading home from a grueling day at work and an equally grueling day at the gym.

I stopped by at the local coffee shop, first, to secure a cappucino before I started my reverse journey for the day. I get the sudden vision of myself from a third person perspective. I take the bus driving west to start my day and then I take a bus driving east to finish it. It’s poetic. It feels like I’m a personification of our sun’s journey across the sky from dawn to dusk, daily.

I get jostled out of my thoughts by the bus coming to a slight abrupt stop. One of the may steps of its journey that it’s done everyday of its mechanical life. Funny quip - imagine if the bus had a soul and could speak about its daily travels (I wonder what stories it would tell?)? So the doors open and in walks a cute little family. They’re sweet, but I’m in a selfish mood. I press a finger to, and hold it on, my Bose earbuds to activate “immersion” mode and turn the music up a little. I catch the father’s facial expression in the mirrored window as the streets pass by. I feel bad, but sir this isn’t about you. I’m sure you’re lovely people with lovely things to talk about. But I have had a hard year. Granted, I know that there are other people who have just as hard a year or worse. The pragmatism is not lost on me, but I too am a person with my own desires and my own hardships.

While I think these selfish thoughts, it sparks another thought about how I used to interact with the world in NYC vs Seattle. In NYC, I thought of myself as polite and caring about others. I helped people where I could and even at times when it distressed me. I thought, “hey, you’re doing a good thing for a person you care about and all you’re giving up is your time. It’s worth it.” And for strangers, I helped people out like a good NY’er does growing up here. We helped random strangers, within reason, and we all quietly knew what type of help you could ask for on a “want basis” vs on a “need basis.” The same is true here for Seattle, but we’re just slightly off from each other, in a way. I notice the difference in behaviors; almost like a brother & sister who are related in fundamental ways, yet, different in so many other, equally fundamental, ways. Funny enough, that thought brought me back to my present moment on the bus.

I start to think about how I am perceived by others. Do they see me as friendly or do they view me as some callous and cold person? As the bus stops, for every rider who pulls the cord to signal a desired stop or to let new travelers onboard from the cold weather outside, I notice the passengers either waving hello/bye or saying “thank you bus driver” on their way out or coming on. This is the realization that has me comparing how I behave here, on the Seattle buses, vs how I did on NYC buses. I immediately highlight the fact that I never said “thank you” to the Seattle bus drivers on my most recent trips (including the start of this one). That realization forced me to search the depths of my memories to see if I ever thanked NYC bus drivers. I conclude I never have and then I begin to wonder if I really am a nice person or not, despite my recollection of my time in NY. Then I begin to dissect those memories further to see if I ever noticed anyone else, on NYC buses, thanking the bus driver. I’m sure there were but I do not think I ever noticed them personally. How could I not notice? I’m supposed to be this Virgo horoscope known for paying attention to the most minutiae of details. My mind races. It tries to sift through all the details and logic to arrive to some sort of epiphany, some s ort of understating, and it finally reaches its desired terminus: size.

In NYC, the buses are almost always at full capacity at any given time. It reminds me of larger cities, like Hong Kong or Tokyo, and I remember watching videos of their transportation network. I remember watching a sea of strangers enter either the trains or buses and, they too, are jam packed while everyone remains steadfast in anonymity, in cold expressionless faces. Logic and pragmatism take over my thoughts, finally, and the answer begins to unveil itself. In NYC, it is harder to take the time and slow your pace for daily niceties. When you share nearly intimate spacing with total strangers all around your person, the last thing anyone anticipates is stopping to thank your driver while a sea of others need to get through you to get to their destinations. It is actually being “kind” to keep the flow moving, off the train or bus, so others are not late or delayed in where they need to go. But Seattle is not NY. Seattle is like a sister to NYC (being its brother). Seattle is softer. Seattle is smaller in size. Seattle is more aligned with just “being.” People here take the time to say “thank you” and enjoy the day at their own leisurely pace instead of being slave to the “hustle & bustle” of an overpopulated city. Seattle enjoys living in the moment and I find my soul resonating. I moved here for a reason after all. And as I alternate between awareness of my surroundings, as the city of Seattle whizzes by outside the bus window,  and de ep reflection of my social quirks, I make the conscious decision to change myself.

I think about making the conscious commitment to become more present in the moment. I decide I will become more present while living my life and achieving my goals. I determine I will start small, like a growing snowball on its way down from the top of a steep mountain. I will begin by joining my fellow citizens in taking the time to thank my drivers as I enter or exit the bus from now on. I conclude that I, too, will join the rest of the Seattleites in thanking my bus driver for their diligence of their daily duties. This makes me feel something. It makes me feel satisfied because I understand I am assessing my present situation, I am investigating past memories, and I am determining to make a meaningful change in who I am…or at least who I am now and want to become.

This enlightenment brings me back to the beginning of my thoughts, on this reverse journey home. I think about how I started my day heading to work and ending my day by self-reflecting on my way home. I smile knowing that I just had a wonderful personal experience amongst total strangers on a public bus. I examined my life, my memories, of who I was and decided to make meaningful changes. I slowly return to the present, to reality, but feeling reinvigorated about myself, about my life, and the day’s hardships seem to just melt away. I turn my head, in a panoramic motion, taking in the sights of the bus. I see fellow passengers in their own worlds. I see that cute family again, but this time I notice that they too are in their own little world and beaming happiness. I catch the dad’s eyes again and we both smile shyly before we both turn our heads away from each other and back to our own lives. I feel better now and I relinquish my thoughts, so my mind can become unencumbered to the music playing in my earbuds for the remaining length of this bus ride home. I smile again and dip my head when doing so because this was not just a bus ride
 home, but it was a bus ride through my own thoughts. ",1,1766168551.0,u_Delusional_At_Best,0,1.0,False

My initial idea is to make it chill, have coffee and tea and calming music with lots of places to sit to talk. Kinda like a blind date event but more casual. There will be name tags where you can write your name, if you are poly or monogamous, your pronouns, and whatever else you want to disclose openly to everyone you see. 

People could then ask to sit down, mingle, maybe make this a first date or a spring to a first date somewhere else. Stuff like that. 

What would you like to see at the event? Different format, music choice, etc",3,1766168517.0,fargo,0,0.57,False

The subway was already full of people who hadn’t slept enough and hoped no one would notice.

Ethan stood near the door, holding his phone like it might fall apart. In three minutes, he was supposed to make a call he had postponed for almost a year.

His father.

They hadn’t argued.
They had just… stopped talking.

Ethan had left for the city chasing a career that didn’t happen fast enough. Each month without results made the silence heavier. Pride grew where words should’ve been.

The train stopped between stations. Lights flickered. No signal.

People sighed. Someone cursed. A woman laughed quietly.

And then Ethan’s phone rang.

Unknown number.

It was his father’s neighbor. Short sentences. No drama.
A hospital. A fall. “He’s asking for you.”

Ethan didn’t run.
He didn’t panic.

He just sat down on the dirty subway floor and breathed — slow, deliberate — the way his father had once taught him when he was a kid afraid of the dark.

In for four.
Out for six.

At the hospital, there were no big speeches. No apologies rehearsed in advance.

His father looked smaller. Older.
But when he saw Ethan, he smiled the same way.

— “You made it,” he said. Not “You’re late.” Not “Where were you?”

Just that.

They talked about nothing important. Weather. Coffee. A bad nurse joke.
The silence didn’t feel heavy anymore.

His father recovered. Slowly.

Ethan went back to the city. Same job. Same problems. Same doubts.

But something had shifted.

He stopped waiting for the “right moment” — at work, in life, in conversations.
He sent the email.
He asked for the meeting.
He made the calls.

Nothing changed overnight.

But months later, when something finally worked, Ethan understood:

Progress didn’t start when he succeeded.

It started the moment he chose not to avoid what scared him.

Sometimes the bravest thing you do
is pick up the phone.

1pqsb5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/kitchen/comments/1pqsb5t/ideas_for_improving_and_reducing_collisions_in/,Ideas for improving and reducing collisions in the kitchen,"Hello,

**Warning**:  **This is a long read**.  I wanted to make sure you had all the details.  I've put my top question at the bottom for those who want to wing it with just the photos.

**For the brave, here is the nitty gritty:**

I've had what I consider a ""good"" kitchen layout  since we designed and built our house.  We put allot of thought into everything 20 years ago.

We nailed certain things but there's a bit that has often annoyed me.  That's the workspace for small appliances and convenient workspace available, in general, when multiple bodies are working together.  Part of it was due to budget constraints making our island a corporate table we got for free after we built.

**It's not all bad:**

I'm happy with allot of it so I'm going to list the things I do like allot:

* Lighting.  The open space and windows has made the kitchen excellent to be in.  I can even work without light at dusk and dawn sometimes.
* Space:  There's allot of space. and the triangle everyone talks about works really well.  We even installed a prep sink right away so we technically have 2 triangles to work from.  This makes a huge difference when multiple people are in there.
* The main cooking flow:  Pull stuff out of fridge and drop below microwave, prep using cutting boards and knives stored above that counter, rinse in prep sink right there, move onto space next to stove and continue with cooking/baking, place cooled pots and pans next to the main sinks, ready to wash.
* Access and visibility: Being able to access from the living room, entrance and hall bedroom hall from one side and the back porch and dining room from the other has been great.
* Visibility:  With an open concept, it's been nice having no upper cabinets over the island or main sinks.  It's great for entertaining, and greeting/waving someone in when they arrive at the front door.
* Our existing colors/cabinet surfaces, mostly.

**So what's the issue if I like the flow so much?**

Enter small appliances!  As you can see in the photos, The microwave, toaster and kettle all use the space next to the fridge.  This is also where spices are stored underneath, and where pots were before those drawers died.  The coffee ""station"" is in the corner on the other side of the prep sink.  There's contention for conveniently located countertop.   I watched my wife make her lunch from leftovers today.  She grabbed food from the fridge to reheat in the microwave, which is super convenient, but then used the remaining space in the corner there to prep her salad because well there's just no room.  If I'd been prepping something, which I often am, I'd be relocating to the island and going back and forth to the prep sink or to where she is to get the tools I need

Another issue is storing certain things away from where they are used, meaning someone else will come bother the person working near that storage for an item them need (doh!).  That corner next to the stove is where baking pans, cooking utensils, mixing bowls, bread, baking ingredients are stored right now.  Other examples:  All our dinnerware is in the area to the right of the stove.  Decent after doing dishes but not as good when someone is working.  Liquor is stored above the stove, just because it was a little high for commonly used stuff and we didn't have a better place.

**Some of my own ideas:**

I have analysis paralysis but I have come up with some decisions and thoughts to bounce off you:

* We're going to be putting in a proper island with lower cabinets and  power therein.  One idea is to move the baking ingredients, electric mixer, mixing bowls and baking utensils and tools to the cabinets in said island.   This will free up most of the storage in the upper and lower cabinets to the left of the stove and the lower cabinet to the right of the stove.  Hopefully this will also render the kitchen island  the natural baking area (mixing, rolling), reducing traffic to the left of the stove.
* The island could be made into an L shape, joining the area with the main sinks and dishwashers and moving that kitchen access closer to the all.  This would allot a small full height pantry where the existing corner cabinet to the left of the sink but would also mean the dishwasher would open very near the new lower corner cabinet in the island.
* Turning our pantry into a regular counter top with upper and lower cabinets, adding a power outlet there and bringing the toaster and related supplies there.  Maybe the kettle too.
* ...or replacing our pantry with the fridge and extending the counter to the right of the fridge to give  more room for all that's going on there.
* Moving the cutlery drawer to the island but I'm not sure that would help so much without the drinkware, plates and bowls following suit.  It would be perfect as a place to bring washed/dried dishes though.
* Repair/replace the 3 drawer cabinet system in the gaping hole in the lower cabinet below the microwave.
* Move pots, pans and baking sheets to the freed up space next the stove
* Get better lower corner cabinets.  Right now, they're just classic annoying corner cabinets.
* Finally finish the pantry (if it stays)
* Use a 2 door Fridge to encourage using the island as a drop zone for it and make it more accessible from the dining room.  Not sure that's enough to make the island a natural drop zone for it but I'm sure it will keep at least some traffic out of the kitchen.

**Some top of mind questions:**

* How would you relocate the toaster and/or coffee work areas and not get in the way of something else or otherwise reduce the demand for the space next to the fridge?
* Any modern cabinet design ideas you'd consider.  Corner cabinets and pantry design come to mind.
* How could I efficiently store the heavy pots and pans next to the stove?  Their weight might be what killed the drawers in both the lower cabinet under the microwave and the pantry

**Budget**:  There is no big money constraint, but I mostly like our kitchen.  I will be spending to get matching doors and drawers as needed and refinishing existing doors.

Excuse the unfinished kitchen backsplash and pantry.  Health issues and budget kept some things looking a little shoddy.  Some bits have broken, which I have to get to (again).

I put allot of time into making this post survivable for you all :)  
Thanks in advance for any ideas you have.

this is also a cross post from another reddit, but i did need some help/advice. 

i’m a high school senior turning 18 this summer, and i’m looking for general financial advice as i prepare to move out and manage my own finances.

i’ve been accepted to yale university and will be moving to new haven, ct (i know it's expensive there, so that's why i'm mentioning this). my education is fully funded, and i plan to complete my undergraduate degree in biology with the goal of becoming an immunodermatologist (so lot's of school left </3).

since tuition isn’t a concern, i’m mainly looking for guidance on things like which financial accounts to open and how to set myself up responsibly early on, especially as someone who will be in school for a long time.

one of my biggest questions is whether it’s smart to work during undergrad even if i don’t need the income for the purpose of investing. any additional advice would be greatly appreciated.



**some extra info**

\- i 'm currently at an ECHS (early college high school) and graduate high school with my associate's degree (all my credits transfer, i will only have 2 years of my bachelor's degree before i graduate with a B.S) 

\- i am incredibly organized and productive so i think i could handle having a job in college? however, they are more difficult courses + more hours so ofc it depends. 

\- i plan on minoring in chemistry 

\- i plan on going to med school right after my undergrad.

\- i have worked around 35hrs per week (more hours over breaks) since my since 10th grade year and currently have around $25k in savings. (i'm at around $15 an hour now working for a coffee company and have stocks as well. this figure could be higher but isn't. this is because i have pretty bad spending habits. i'm super girly and spend a lot of money on things like shoes, makeup and clothes + i go out a lot and love giving gifts/paying for strangers/etc. i'm working on it tho!! promise)

So I hooked our accounts up to an AI finance tool. It automatically categorizes everything, tracks our bills, and builds the budget based on when our paychecks hit.

Every Sunday, I sit down with her and give her a ""financial update."" I tell her exactly how much we spent on groceries, what bills are coming up, and how our savings are looking.
