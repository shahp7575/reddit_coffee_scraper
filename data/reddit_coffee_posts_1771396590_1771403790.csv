If I can do exactly what the writer was talking about — based on their 60-day experiment — I’ll leave the resource link at the bottom of this post.

It’s all about switching to a cash-only budget, where you divide your take-home pay into different envelopes: groceries, gas and transport, social life, coffee and small treats, household supplies, and emergency savings.

Putting real cash into each envelope creates a clear limit.

The reason I like this idea is that it helps you stick to your budget plan. When the coffee envelope starts running low, there’s no overdraft or credit card to save you.

Just to use what you have not what you don't.

I'm not really one to ask for favors or be pampered because I grew up doing things myself, but small acts of noticing how frustrated I get when I can't peel off seals from things I bought or having warm water ready when I wake up when I have my period, it means more to me than just doing what is requested because I feel like that's the bare minimum, but doing the extra mile?

1r7xj54,https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/1r7xj54/trying_to_replicate_morning_fuel_vanilla_matcha/,Trying to replicate Morning Fuel Vanilla Matcha Shake,"Hey everybody,

I'm addicted to Morning Fuel Vanilla Matcha Shake (from Alphafoods), which has become my coffee replacement for the last 2 years. Now it is not available for some reason and I'm in desperate need (yes I'm exaggerating) of a replacement. I've asked two AIs to help me replicate that stuff, and it has actually worked to some degree, but it's still not quite like the original. I'm not going for 100% the original, but something with the same effect and a well rounded taste. I was hoping to find people here that know these things better than I do. Here's the powder's composition:

`Ingredients: OATS (ground), pea protein powder, coconut blossom sugar, flavoring, spinach leaf powder, MCT oil powder (from coconut), quinoa flour, emulsifier (lecithins), thickener (guar gum), spirulina powder (SULPHITES), Indian psyllium husk powder, maca root powder, ALMONDS (ground), sweet potato powder, guarana seed extract (contains 22% caffeine), matcha powder, alfalfa herb powder, bromelain (pineapple), sweetener (steviol glycosides from stevia), cyanocobalamin, pyridoxine hydrochloride.`

I got most of these components. What I don't have is quinoa flour, spirulina, sweet potato powder (because I can't find the yellow kind, only the purple). Also I don't have the last few ingredients: alfalfa herb powder, bromelain (pineapple), sweetener (steviol glycosides from stevia), cyanocobalamin, pyridoxine hydrochloride. The herb powder is expensive to ship, and if it's not absolutely necessary, I'd rather save the money. The rest I think is just micronutrients that I don't need. I take enough of these in other ways.

So far what I'm doing is rather amateurish, I don't have precision scales. For a 30g scoop (the original measurement spoon) I take (tsp=tea spoon)  
\~ 15g oats flour  
\~ 2 tsp coconut sugar  
\~ 2 tsp sp pea protein  
1 tsp spinach powder  
1 tsp mct oil powder  
1 tsp soy lecithine  
1 tsp almonds flour   
1/2 tsp guarana  
1/2 tsp maca root  
1/4 tsp guar gum  
1/4 tsp psyllium husk powder  
1/4 tsp matcha

The result is somewhat close to the original. The texture is ok-ish now, the sweetness also. The color is too yellowish (I guess because no spirulina), but that's not a big deal. Not sure about the coffeine dose. It seems fine. The original has 50mg per 30g which is around the same as an espresso. That's what I'm aiming for.

The taste is... well, it's drinkable. Something's clearly missing though.

Maybe someone here knows the original stuff, or how these things are made in general? Any thoughts welcome.",1,1771403328.0,soylent,0,1.0,False
1r7xit5,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatewaytapes/comments/1r7xit5/has_anyone_experienced_negative_life_events_after/,Has anyone experienced negative life events after starting the Gateway Tapes?,"hi everyone,

it's been 1 month since I started listening to gateway tapes, once every day before sleeping, often twice a day.  
I'm still a beginner, I don't think I ever reached the focus 10 level, but I truly enjoy this tapes because in those moments I feel in peace and I can experience a different way of living compared with normal day life.  
But...  
Since I started many unfortunate events occurred in my life:

* My best friend turned out to be fake and blocked me.
* My girlfriend cheated without remorse.
* My work has been declining.
* 30 mins ago , even my laptop adapter started smoking and partially burned in a coffee shop.

I know this sounds irrational,  but I’ve never had so many strongly negative events happening at the same time in the last 3–4 years.

The Gateway tapes are the only significant change in my routine recently.

I saw a video claiming that Gateway meditations could be questionable because the frequencies used are not fully disclosed, and it made comparisons to how Aum Shinrikyō , the japanese terrorist, allegedly used sound frequencies to convert followers.

I know my brain might try to look for patterns and rationalize this events, even when there aren’t any, however…

  
I just want honest feedback from people who have practiced Gateway for longer:

* Did you ever experience destabilization?
* Did you notice negative coincidences?
* Is it possible that intensive meditation can psychologically amplify perception of negative events?

I genuinely want grounded opinions from experienced practitioners.

**Revolution and Evolution**

The newsreader’s voice drifted across the dinner table.

“major protests are expected to disrupt the city tomorrow”

Mum shook her head before the reporter even finished. “Pointless,” she scoffed. “They block roads. They yell. Nothing changes.”

 “Can I go?” I asked. “My friends at school want to go

She paused mid-step and turned around. “No. Protests are dangerous. Police get involved. You’re too young to be there.”

“Maybe it’s more dangerous if the youth stay silent,” I said quietly. 

Grandma chuckled “You’re just like i was”

“What do you mean?” I asked.

Grandma folded her napkin carefully. “When I was around your age,” she said, turning to me, “I did not ask for permission to protest.”

I blinked. “You…. protested?”

“All the time ,” she replied. “When I was studying at university back in Ethiopia. During the student movement.”

She stood up slowly. “Wait here, I want to show you something.”

Mum rolled her eyes “You know times have changed since you used to do all of that”

Mum moved toward the pantry, reaching for the coffee beans. When she roasts them, it’s like a ritual, slow and meticulous. I knew the rhythm - the smoke, the grinding, the brewing. I had time.

Grandma returned from her room with a small book, the leather cracked like dry earth. The cover read ‘Mastawesha Debter’ (diary)

“Read what I’ve written,” she said.

  


# March 28th, 1971 – Haile Selassie University, Addis Ababa 

Today we marched against the very man that our university is named after.

We’ve become outraged with the land and wealth inequities in our country. 

The chant began softly.

“Meret Le’arashu” (Land to the Tiller) 

Then it began to roar.

When the police released tear gas, the air turned to liquid fire. We pressed wet cloth to our faces to ease the pain. Some ran and took cover. Many stayed and marched.

I realised something then, and it's that the future belongs to those who were brave enough to disrupt the present. 

The future is ours.



The words did not sound like a history lesson. They were a message that my generation needed to hear. Urgently.

I turned the page.



# Speech from the Library Steps –  May 25th, 1972

He raised his hand, and the murmuring subdued.

“They call us impatient,” he began. “They say reform takes time.”

A brief pause followed.

“But how long must injustice wait before it is addressed?”

The question lingered in the air.

“We do not stand here because we despise our country. We stand because we refuse to inherit its inequalities.”

“A government that fears its youth, should fear its future.”

For a moment, we did not cheer.

We simply stood, but our hearts were moved. Then the chanting began.

“Meret Le’arashu!”



In the kitchen, the beans cracked loudly, splitting under the heat of the *Jebena*.

Another page.



# Letter to a Comrade– October 18th, 1972

Dear Almaz,

Bring the thick cardboard from behind the cafeteria if you can. And bring red paint, as it's more visible on our signs.

Soak cloth in water before you come. If the gas is released again, the younger members  will panic, so make sure there's enough cloth to go around. Tell them to link arms and stay together. Dispersal is what they want. We must show that we won’t back down. 

If arrests happen, do not let the march dwindle. Continue to the city square.

Resistance must outlast the sirens.

“Land to the tiller” is not just a chant.

It’s a promise we will make real.



Your sister in solidarity, Kelem

*SENT VIA ROYAL ETHIOPIAN POSTAL SERVICE* 



# July 7th, 1973

Today, our lecture was cut short, after the police barged into the hall. They took five students. They did not resist, but didn’t cower either, walking out with their hands cuffed but heads held high

The police wanted to struggle so they can justify their force, they wanted us to beg so they can feel their power. They gave them neither.



The smoke from the coffee drifted into the living room now, and I flipped another page forward.



# September 12th, 1974

The news had spread like wildfire. The monarchy has fallen. 

The coup was not ours alone, but our continued efforts and relentless activism fractured the myth that authority was impenetrable

No system is as permanent as it pretends to be.

  


# March 4th, 1975

The feudal land system has been abolished.

The Public Ownership of Rural Lands Proclamation has now been implemented.

The landlords will no longer own what they do not cultivate.

For years, “Land to the tiller” was just a chant sung by students. Today, it is law



“Buna’s ready,” Mum called.

I closed the diary gently, its words replaying in my mind. 

When I returned to the table, Grandma watched me closely.

“Well?” Mum asked.

I took a breath.

“You said protests don’t change anything,” I began. “But Grandma protested for years before land reform became law. She watched a monarchy collapse. She saw a system shift because people refused to be silent.”

Mum’s jaw clenched. “And what came after? It’s not that simple.”

“I know things weren’t perfect after,” I said. “But protest doesn’t promise a utopia, it just refuses to allow time to pass without necessary evolution.”

Grandma smiled slightly, almost as if she could see her younger self speaking through me.

“If they hadn’t protested,” I continued, “the feudal system would have stayed, and none of the working class would have any land, or money. If we don’t protest inequity now, it too will stay.”

The kitchen was quiet except for the soft hum of the heater.

Mum exhaled slowly. “Why do you think it’s your responsibility?”

“It's not just mine, it's everyone's,"" I said. “You always taught me to care about fairness. Grandma's stories showed me the cost of caring, and what can blossom from it.”

Mum's gaze softened as she looked back at the diary still resting on the table. 

“Fine, you can go,” she said finally. “But keep your phone on.”



Later in the night, my fingers excitedly clicked my phone's keypad as I messaged my group chat.

Meet me at the train station tomorrow at 10AM, we're going to the protest. 

Btw, does anyone have some cardboard and a spray can?

She has never had a pet in youth  (except bird and squirrel in the childhood, she ki11ed them btw). 

When her son (my husband) was 13ish years old he found a kitten, British. Cat lived with them for \~2 years. Then “doctor” called and said that all the family has BAD CAT ALLERGY (no tests were taken and no symptoms of course wasn’t seen). Cat was given away the very next morning. Cool, huh? 

Then it was hedgehog. Firstly, she thought hedgehog was bought for torturing (like, WTF?? who thinks about that when your son buys a pet ???)

3 years later it d1ed because apparently someone gave it unwashed strawberries from sketchy market. 

Now my husband and I have cats, everything great. Our late cat hated this woman - she grabbed cat, tried to take photos, yelled at cat.. of course cat was furious and scratched her badly. 

Now we have to stay at my husbands parents place (due to heavy shelling of our area we had to move out temporarily), cats of course are confused. One of them peed in wrong place for a few times, and of surely we are “bad cat parents”, “we are doing something wrong that’s why she pees in the wrong place - TO REVENGE US FOR SOMETHING WE DID” (what a bull omg).

Damn I just don’t understand this woman. 

She buys cats food and beds and brushes etc even if they have everything and the next moment she goes “two cats are too much you  should FUCKING GIVE ONE AWAY TO FUCKING SOMEONE”. 

Or she opens windows to take some pictures of forest or sunset or other shit without noticing that two hyperactive creatures zooming around who able to jump from the floor on my shoulder with zero effort. Damn, women, can you just notice anything around you ? She says I got it I’ll keep an eye on them and at the same time cats already looking down from fucking opened window at 7th floor. 

I’m genuinely afraid that one day I’ll go for a walk and when I’m back cats either thrown away or fall out of the window or drowned in washing machine or she gave them (FUCKING AGAIN) avocado or coffee to try. 5 yrs old behaviour but 45+ yrs woman. 

Yeah, remember, I wrote  about AlLeRgY? 

All family lives under one roof with two cats who shed like crazy and everything is okay. 

Pretty much same when she say she has anaphylactic shock after bee sting/some pollens/mustard, but she doesn’t have an epipen or even some simplest anti allergy pills like loratadini and in the same time goes for a warm to fields full of bees wasps spiders flower etc. (mustard allergy is real btw, maybe I should add some to her soup.

Even if let's say I had perfect compliance over week 3 & extrapolated, I would still be only about 75% of the way there. I also had better weight loss in the past (PSMF - around 5 kg / month each time). So I feel I am missing a few tricks here...



\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I still believe & I am working on the assumption that the key to obesity is disregulation of appetite by endocrine distruptors - mainly phthalates, mainly picked up in processing. But the more I control for them, the more I start seeing some other effects that also matter:

\- my appetite goes up, but not crazy up (say from av of 1,000kcal > 1,500kcal) after coming into contact with peelable fruit / veg subject to systemic fungicides post harvest - noticed with with oranges, sweet potatoes & regular potatoes. So it's more than just phthalates... 

\- sometimes I am cold, just out of the blue after eating something. It is very obvious, as temp in the flat is largely constant, and most of the times I am perfectly comfortable with it - until I am suddently not! Unclear why. 

\- my levels of energy have been fluctuating widely over this month from very good to real sluggish. Can't quite tell why - it does not map to say days when eating less or more. 

\- so has water retention in the body - my rings go from tight fit to falling off the finger from day to day and even within the same day (and my salt intake is usually consistent - and due to baking & pickles, quite high!). 

\- enzymes in food (TG & amylase) make little impact on appetite - maybe 1-200 kcal increase - unlike what I previously thought. They still make my life a misery due to allergy / digestion issues so I'll carry on avoiding them for those reasons). Plus, they impact energy levels & bloat levels - so, they're confounders to some extent to other things I'd like to monitor. 



\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

So the goals for next month are as follows:

\- Aim for better compliance (I have no travel plans, so that may actually be possible)

\- Add more foods into the mix - especially spices - the more varied the diet, without ruining the weight loss magic, the better

\- Keep an eye on indicators other than appetite, such as energy levels, water retention & temperature. Experiment with organic / non-organic produce to see if it makes a difference, at which point it'll be clear its post harvest treatments and / or pesticide residues that are the problem. 

\- (& stay away from TG, no one needs that shit!). 



\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Here's some week on week notes & changes I made to the food protocol at the end. 



*Week 1 - Meat & milk*

3 days of perfect compliance - when I ate nothing but peelable fruit & veg, potatoes, meat, eggs, nuts in shells, fresh herbs, brine pickles & duck fat rendered by me from the Xmas duck. Only things eaten that were touched by industry in any way were coffee & salt (and I guess, meat?). Average kcal for this period: just under 1,000.

The rest of the time I had some milk with the coffee & went out and had food cooked by others, nothing too serious, but it included oils / butter, seeds & fruit juice. Max calories in these days - 2,010. 

After struggling with feeling miserable almost constantly over the holidays, it became clear to me that:

\- producers now add mTG to whole milk, incl. organic and unhomogenised 😱 AND

\- to a lot of organic & grass fed large meat pieces I used to buy from butchers & upmarker supermarkets (!!!) And in some fresh whole fish 😱. 

I am beyond furious at this new level of food adulteration. I get an unpleasant allergic reaction to mTG, so it's something I want to avoid, regardless of trying to avoid plasticisers. And it's becoming impossible. The symptoms are: red face / sore throath within 15-20 mins of eating, then feeling like you got the flu + a hungover + indigestion for 12-24 hrs after (tired, low concentration, muscle & joint pain, bloat). 

In fact I was so furious that I started another sub r/foodadulteration. It's not about health, just about how UK food shops & producers rip you off these days.



\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

*Week 2 - Sugar & sunflower oil*

Had a lot of sugar (probably 50g+ on 3 days) due to.. making marmalade and eating a lot of it, repeatedly!  Still, 2 of those days were under 1,300 and one under 900kcal. Sugar's not the enemy, at least not as far as appetite's concerned. 

Also had up to 2 tbsp of sunflower oil on 2 days, both under 1,300kcal (I do not trust my batch of lard...TG wise) Sunflower oil, in small quantities also okay.

But, 1 cup oat milk > 1,650 kcal. Plus TG allergy symptoms. Never doing that again. 

I have actually had terrible bloat since starting with the sugar...



\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

*Week 3 - Beans*

Started the week eating black beans, cooked at home from dry. Kcal - 2,500+ 😱😤 WTF? Obvs that made me look into all the intricacies of processing dry beans to figure out why that may be (had chickepeas & soybeans before with no issues, so whatever it is, it's not generalised to all beans & pulses). The only suspect I can think of is the heat treatment that some manufacturers apply to comply with various hygene rules, imposed on food importers (in the same way as for some spices). 

Took to days to get back to around 1,200kcal's worth of at lib appetite. But then ate out 2x, ending the next days at just above 2,000. 

While eating a lot after the black beans incident, my go to food was marmalade. And therefore ate a ton of sugar. The crazy bloat went on... so much so that I cut out sugar toward the end of the week to see what happens. 

Bloat gone. And weight started to come off too. 

I guess the sugar bloat is due to the amylase used in its production to separate the starches from the sugar in sugarcane. Amylase is typically used to facilitate fermentation... you get the picture as to what it may do in your intestines and what the outward signs of that may be. Not ideal. The amounts involved in white sugar are waaaaaay less than in flour & baked goods, though. 

Also had a lot of diet coke, from PET bottle, with no adverse effects. But had regular coke from glass bottle & was really freezing thereafter & hungrier... weird. 

And some fish (whole-smoked) with no issues. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*



*Week 4 - Lentils & veg*

Almost perfect compliance for 6 days (+ one day going out, with food, desert, booze - still under 2,200kcal). Mainly bread, aivar, eggs, potatoes & fruit / veg based. 

Had some UK grown brown lentils - no issues, pulses okay (if not heat treated?). Guess the safest way is to buys beans / pulses grown locally. 

Had some non-pealable veg, which are typically not covered in edible waxes - mushrooms, cauliflower, kale. Cold & mildly hungry after the kale.

Had sweet potatoes - appetite jumped up to 1,450kcal. same happened with kiwi. Hmmm.. 



\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

*The updated diet protocol*



OK to Eat (the \* means organic)

\- naked grains - wheat (standard\*, durum)

\- covered grains, fully polished only - white rice

\- pulses - soybeans\*, brown lentils (whole), 

\- peelables - potatoes\*, apples\*, oranges\*, carrots\*, onions\*, parsnips\*, brussel sprouts, cabbage\*, lemons, tomatoes, aubergines, peppers (peeled after roasting), mango, bananas, plantains, beetroot\*, garlic

\- non-peelables - mushrooms, cauliflower, spring onion, rosemary, parsley, broccoli\*, celery\*

\- nuts in shells - brazil nuts, coconut, peanuts, walnuts

\- eggs

\- whole fish, smoked (fresh seems to have TG).

\- seeds - poppy\*, unhulled sesame\*, linseed\* & chia - 1tbsp max (for baking decoration purposes!)

\- spices & aids - salt, chilli flakes\*, pepper, dried porcini mushrooms, nutritional yeast\*, active dry yeast. 

\- cofee



& the following industrially produced stuff that don't seem to affect me much:

\- white sugar (but with serious bloat if say > 50g)

\- jaggery (one brand only, sugar block not powder, same bloating problem as with sugar at larger quantities). 

\- sunflower oil\* (up to 2tbsp)

\- diet coke 



I have suspicions on the following:

\- peelables - papaya, kiwi, sweet potatoes, potatoes, oranges, tangerines 

\- non-peelables - kale

\- white sugar / jaggery 



& Staying away from: 

\- black beans\* (dry)

\- milk & non-dairy substitutes (literally cannot find TG free milk, incl. plant 'milk' in the shops any more!) 

\- meat (avoiding as it is mostly not TG free - search for an honest supplier is on!). ",1,1771402593.0,PlasticObesity,0,1.0,False

Thanks for accepting me here. 

I'm 27M. I've been trying to verify if I had apnea during the past 6 months. The reason was a partner and some friends telling me that I was doing long pauses during my sleep, and snoring quite a lot.

Personally, I feel tired a lot of the time. I take coffee and do naps 1-2 times a day, and I regularly feel ""in my head"" and not very present in the moment. Social events tend to exhaust me quite fast, like I have a 1-hour endurance and then I turn into a passive mode where I only ""react"" to things. Also a libido clearly different from my male friends.

So I started a long journey, doing a first polygraphy (result: 2.4 AHI, no apnea), then a second one (2.6, no apnea). I then saw a surgeon specialized in sleep problems, and he diagnosed me with UARS symptoms, identifying 3 sources of obstruction (enlarged uvula, enlarged tonsils, deviated septum). He agreed to operate on all of this, then changed his mind 1 week before surgery after reviewing the polygraphy, saying he wasn't sure I had something and wanting to investigate further.

Then finally I did a last test, a polysomnography, out of spite and just to try one last thing because I had lost hope at that point. The nurses were struggling with the device, not very sure how to handle it - like they were googling the manual in front of me. My mom, as a nurse, told me it wasn't that uncommon and that the diagnosis is still valid, but I made me doubt.

According to the test, I slept something like 3.5 hours, I had 66 micro-arousals per hour, and an AHI at 15. The 3.5 hours of sleep also made me doubt, the nurses telling it was a short night. But now the surgeon has agreed to operate, but I feel like even I don't trust my own case anymore.

I had two negative tests, a surgeon first refusing to operate me. An expensive polysomnography with unsure nurses and a short night. All my family and friends look at me with skepticism when I tell them about sleep apnea. My parents told me ""you know, we are tired a lot of the time too!"", my friends tell me I seem fine. Even I doubt, because sometimes I can have a productive day of work, I do sports every day or every other day, my energy levels seem very variable (I can feel very energetic, sometimes super lazy, sometimes ""lazy but stressed"" - I think nearly everyone could say the same). So on the surface I feel like a person who doesn't have apnea, and the diagnosis has been so long and chaotic so I'm not 100% reassured. 

Also, even if I'm handling it so far, I'm not at a perfect point in my life. So I may have some anxiety, or low mood, and it's hard to tell if I don't suffer from psychological issues of sleep apnea.

So I'm kinda lost and I think I need reassurance before the surgery, in six days. Do I really have something significant? Is a surgery really going to improve my life significantly? Or is the anxiety, low libido, and ""inside my head"" feeling just the result of a temporarily difficult period in my life?",1,1771402036.0,SleepApnea,3,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

After some research I narrowed it down to these grinders:

\* 1zpresso K Max

\* 1zpresso J Max

\* 1zpresso J Ultra

\* Kingrinder K4

\* Kingrinder K6

I'll use it 90% of the time for espresso but i also have an aeropress that I'd like to use. (Especially when travelling).

I only drink dark and medium roast coffees and want to make milk based drinks as well.

I’ve seen some videos from Lance Hendricks and wanted to ask if any of you could share some advice or real world experience using these hand grinders. I really need help choosing between these different grinders. I want something that can grow with my hobby so i can use it for a longer period of time without having to upgrade it.

“Happy Accident”

POV Ivy

I used to be fun, untamed, crazy, and the life of the party.

Then I met Keith, and within five years I turned into a doormat. 

The moment I found Keith's second hidden phone with my cousin Linsey naked on the screen, my entire world turned upside down.

I was done. I had shed my last tear, and it was time to move on from that asshole.

I phoned my best friend, Ella Shepherd. 

She dropped everything and insisted we go away for a girls’ week.

Now I’m in Vegas with Ella, trying to forget my shattered life.

“Ella, this bathing suit is practically dental floss with tiny triangles over my nipples.”

“You said you wanted the Vegas experience.”

“Yeah, in baby steps, not straight from good girl to hooker,” I point out.

“It’s a three thousand dollar bikini, Ivy, not some trashy hooker outfit,” Ella says.

‘Just wear your trench coat to the pool, then jump in the water quickly and hope it doesn’t fall apart,’ my wolf Ash teases me.

I head to my hotel room two doors down from hers.

After putting it on, I look in the mirror and feel beyond mortified.

‘All you need is a stripper pole,’ Ash chuckles.

I instantly grab my trench coat and hide my body. 

At least I’m wearing the bikini. Baby steps…

I put my dark hair in a bun and bravely step out into the hallway.

‘Relax, you're the only one who knows what’s under the trench coat,’ Ash teases.

I make it as far as the elevator, wimp out, and knock on Ella’s door. 

When I knock, the door just opens. The latch is keeping it from closing.

I guess she knew I would be back. 

I walk in slowly.

“Listen, I think…”

“Yes,” a shirtless god of a man says, standing there like he’s expecting me. “You’re fucking an hour late. Now I have no time to fuck you. I have a meeting in twenty minutes. This is unacceptable!”

My heart races, and my cheeks turn beet red.

He’s incredibly tall; his eyes are blue green. His hair is dark and wild, his face is flawless, his body is pure muscle, and he’s holding a whip.

“Are you even listening to me?” he growls.

I snap out of my daze.

“I don’t think he’s a wolf, Ash. We need to get out of here,” I say to my wolf in my head, slowly backing up towards the door.

“Whoa, I wasn’t trying to scare you. What’s with the trench coat?” he says, walking over and unbuttoning it.

His musky scent makes my world tilt, and I think my mouth is hanging open.

‘Your mouth is hanging open, you need to shut it,’ Ash, my wolf, snickers.

When he’s done with the buttons, he opens my coat. His eyes widen, and he flashes me the sexiest smile.

His scent, the way he looks at me, I suddenly feel dizzy, drunk on him.

My legs get weak, and he catches me.

“Fuck, are you drunk?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“On drugs?”

I shake my head.

“What is it then?”

I smile and touch his hard, muscular chest, but he pulls away.

I brace myself against the wall.

“No touching. It’s bad enough you're not even my type. If you're going to break the rules, I’m going to have to spank you.”

‘Did he just say he’ll spank you if you break the rules? Quick, touch his chest again,’ Ash begs.

We both love to be spanked. Keith thought it was childish.

Ash takes over and places both hands on his chest, and we lean against his rock hard muscles, and the guy looks at me in surprise.

I slide my hand down over his abs, and he tenses but doesn’t move.

“I’ve been naughty. Spank me,” I smile mischievously.

He yanks off my trench coat, puts me over his lap on the bed, and spanks me with his whip. 

Oddly, he’s gentle with it.

When he’s done, I grab him and kiss him quickly on the lips.

Over his lap I go again. This time he’s angry about my defiance and spanks me harder with his hand.

I’m in absolute heaven when I feel him graze my tiny bikini bottoms.

“Are you wet from me spanking you?” he growls.

I don’t answer.

He spanks me harder. I try not to moan in pleasure.”

I’m a weirdo. I know.

“I’ve gone over my twenty minutes. I have to go,” he says, letting me up.

I dive on him with my whole body and kiss him and bite his bottom lip.

I jump off him, grab my trench coat, fly out the door, and slam right into Ella.

“Run!” I yell at the top of my lungs, grabbing her arm and pulling her along with me.

We run for our lives, like I just left the scene of a crime. Pushing ourselves as fast as we can down the hall, and hide panting behind the stairwell door.

“Wait. Why are we running? Why is your ass bright red?”

I cover her mouth, shove her face into the tiny window on the stairwell door, and we watch him come out of his room.

“Oh my God, look at that ass,” she says as we watch him walk down the hall to the elevator, pushing the button and glaring at his watch. “Did you hire a male escort?” 

“No, I walked into what I thought was your room, and he thought I was there to service him.”

“Wait, you just pimped yourself out?” Ella says, shocked.

“No, he just took off my trench coat, said I wasn’t his type, and spanked me when I touched his chest.”

“You what?”

“It was Ash’s idea. He only had twenty minutes, and I wanted a good spanking,” I smile, putting back on the trench coat.

“You can’t go swimming with a red ass.” 

“Good, I'm starved. Let's eat. I’ll change and…”

“No, I was looking forward to the pool. I’ll buy lunch, you wear the trench coat,” she demands.

She pulls my hair out of the bun in the elevator and walks arm in arm with me like I’m her girlfriend into the restaurant.

“You’re having steak and potatoes,” she says.

“No, a salad.” 

“Ivy, you're wasting away. Did Keith even let you eat?”

“He likes his women small and skinny.”

“You’re practically a bone rack.”

“Fine, order me whatever as long as it comes with a coffee,” I say.

“Oh, no.”

“What wrong?” I ask her.

“Your client is here. Looks like he’s in a meeting.”

“He’s not my client. He didn’t pay me,” I hiss.

“Like you would tell me if you did.”

“Just drop it. I walked into the wrong room, and he had a whip, and I couldn’t leave until he punished me. Just let it go,” I say.

“Do you realize how insane you sound,” she points out.

I whip open my trench coat. “No, this dental floss bikini is the only insane thing here.”

I look over, and the waiter is standing there, checking me out slowly, head to toe.

I shut my trench coat.

“Flash me for thirty seconds, and your meal is on me,” he says.

“Happy Accident”

POV Ivy

I used to be fun, untamed, crazy, and the life of the party.

Then I met Keith, and within five years I turned into a doormat. 

The moment I found Keith's second hidden phone with my cousin Linsey naked on the screen, my entire world turned upside down.

I was done. I had shed my last tear, and it was time to move on from that asshole.

I phoned my best friend, Ella Shepherd. 

She dropped everything and insisted we go away for a girls’ week.

Now I’m in Vegas with Ella, trying to forget my shattered life.

“Ella, this bathing suit is practically dental floss with tiny triangles over my nipples.”

“You said you wanted the Vegas experience.”

“Yeah, in baby steps, not straight from good girl to hooker,” I point out.

“It’s a three thousand dollar bikini, Ivy, not some trashy hooker outfit,” Ella says.

‘Just wear your trench coat to the pool, then jump in the water quickly and hope it doesn’t fall apart,’ my wolf Ash teases me.

I head to my hotel room two doors down from hers.

After putting it on, I look in the mirror and feel beyond mortified.

‘All you need is a stripper pole,’ Ash chuckles.

I instantly grab my trench coat and hide my body. 

At least I’m wearing the bikini. Baby steps…

I put my dark hair in a bun and bravely step out into the hallway.

‘Relax, you're the only one who knows what’s under the trench coat,’ Ash teases.

I make it as far as the elevator, wimp out, and knock on Ella’s door. 

When I knock, the door just opens. The latch is keeping it from closing.

I guess she knew I would be back. 

I walk in slowly.

“Listen, I think…”

“Yes,” a shirtless god of a man says, standing there like he’s expecting me. “You’re fucking an hour late. Now I have no time to fuck you. I have a meeting in twenty minutes. This is unacceptable!”

My heart races, and my cheeks turn beet red.

He’s incredibly tall; his eyes are blue green. His hair is dark and wild, his face is flawless, his body is pure muscle, and he’s holding a whip.

“Are you even listening to me?” he growls.

I snap out of my daze.

“I don’t think he’s a wolf, Ash. We need to get out of here,” I say to my wolf in my head, slowly backing up towards the door.

“Whoa, I wasn’t trying to scare you. What’s with the trench coat?” he says, walking over and unbuttoning it.

His musky scent makes my world tilt, and I think my mouth is hanging open.

‘Your mouth is hanging open, you need to shut it,’ Ash, my wolf, snickers.

When he’s done with the buttons, he opens my coat. His eyes widen, and he flashes me the sexiest smile.

His scent, the way he looks at me, I suddenly feel dizzy, drunk on him.

My legs get weak, and he catches me.

“Fuck, are you drunk?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“On drugs?”

I shake my head.

“What is it then?”

I smile and touch his hard, muscular chest, but he pulls away.

I brace myself against the wall.

“No touching. It’s bad enough you're not even my type. If you're going to break the rules, I’m going to have to spank you.”

‘Did he just say he’ll spank you if you break the rules? Quick, touch his chest again,’ Ash begs.

We both love to be spanked. Keith thought it was childish.

Ash takes over and places both hands on his chest, and we lean against his rock hard muscles, and the guy looks at me in surprise.

I slide my hand down over his abs, and he tenses but doesn’t move.

“I’ve been naughty. Spank me,” I smile mischievously.

He yanks off my trench coat, puts me over his lap on the bed, and spanks me with his whip. 

Oddly, he’s gentle with it.

When he’s done, I grab him and kiss him quickly on the lips.

Over his lap I go again. This time he’s angry about my defiance and spanks me harder with his hand.

I’m in absolute heaven when I feel him graze my tiny bikini bottoms.

“Are you wet from me spanking you?” he growls.

I don’t answer.

He spanks me harder. I try not to moan in pleasure.”

I’m a weirdo. I know.

“I’ve gone over my twenty minutes. I have to go,” he says, letting me up.

I dive on him with my whole body and kiss him and bite his bottom lip.

I jump off him, grab my trench coat, fly out the door, and slam right into Ella.

“Run!” I yell at the top of my lungs, grabbing her arm and pulling her along with me.

We run for our lives, like I just left the scene of a crime. Pushing ourselves as fast as we can down the hall, and hide panting behind the stairwell door.

“Wait. Why are we running? Why is your ass bright red?”

I cover her mouth, shove her face into the tiny window on the stairwell door, and we watch him come out of his room.

“Oh my God, look at that ass,” she says as we watch him walk down the hall to the elevator, pushing the button and glaring at his watch. “Did you hire a male escort?”

1r7x37g,https://www.reddit.com/r/roleplaying/comments/1r7x37g/f4m_past_lovers_reunited/,[F4M] Past lovers reunited,"We were inseparable. I met you during a time I needed a breath of fresh air which is exactly what you brought. You were passionate about fast cars, bonfires, and wrenching in the garage. On the other hand, I loved reading, exploring new shops in town, listening to music, and was generally a homebody. Together, we introduced each other to new experiences. You taught me how to change a tire and change my oil, while I showed you my favorite coffee and how to relax in a field. As the year progressed, our love for each other only grew stronger. I yearned for you your presence more and more. You loved me in ways I had never imagined, understanding my needs and desires perfectly. From a gentle squeeze of my hand when I was feeling overwhelmed to encouraging me to step out of my comfort zone when I needed a nudge, I could always count on you to catch me if I fell. Everybody in town was always smitten with you, yearning to experience what I knew so well. They would throw themselves at you, sending their numbers to you even when they thought I wouldn’t notice. Despite all this, you always made it clear that your love was for me alone. 

For a while, I noticed that you had been acting differently, but if you wanted to talk about it, you would have brought it up. I would lie on your chest quietly and let you twirl my hair in your fingers while you listened to your music. I would text you, filling you in on what I was doing when you said you were too busy. We went a week without seeing each other, and soon enough, it was a month. I received short texts here and there, but there was something amiss. I decided to bake your favorite cupcakes, hoping to stop by the shop to see you, but when I pulled up, I saw a car I recognized too well. With tears streaming down my face, I dropped the cupcakes and walked out. I drove and drove until I pulled over on the side of the highway to cry. My phone was flooded with messages and missed calls, but I blocked your number. I didn’t want an explanation; I wanted nothing from you.

Six years later, I’m returning to my hometown. I had moved away after the heartbreak and decided that I needed to achieve my dreams on my own. I became a model and had a house in the woods by the river. My quiet place away from the city. My parents had been nagging me about coming back home to visit, but after years of procrastination, I couldn’t put it off any longer. I had been avoiding town because of a foolish high school love story. I had decided to meet up with some old friends at the local spot, unaware that you frequented it every Friday.

The moment I found Keith's second hidden phone with my cousin Linsey naked on the screen, my entire world turned upside down.

I was done. I had shed my last tear, and it was time to move on from that asshole.

I phoned my best friend, Ella Shepherd. 

She dropped everything and insisted we go away for a girls’ week.

Now I’m in Vegas with Ella, trying to forget my shattered life.

“Ella, this bathing suit is practically dental floss with tiny triangles over my nipples.”

“You said you wanted the Vegas experience.”

“Yeah, in baby steps, not straight from good girl to hooker,” I point out.

“It’s a three thousand dollar bikini, Ivy, not some trashy hooker outfit,” Ella says.

‘Just wear your trench coat to the pool, then jump in the water quickly and hope it doesn’t fall apart,’ my wolf Ash teases me.

I head to my hotel room two doors down from hers.

After putting it on, I look in the mirror and feel beyond mortified.

‘All you need is a stripper pole,’ Ash chuckles.

I instantly grab my trench coat and hide my body. 

At least I’m wearing the bikini. Baby steps…

I put my dark hair in a bun and bravely step out into the hallway.

‘Relax, you're the only one who knows what’s under the trench coat,’ Ash teases.

I make it as far as the elevator, wimp out, and knock on Ella’s door. 

When I knock, the door just opens. The latch is keeping it from closing.

I guess she knew I would be back. 

I walk in slowly.

“Listen, I think…”

“Yes,” a shirtless god of a man says, standing there like he’s expecting me. “You’re fucking an hour late. Now I have no time to fuck you. I have a meeting in twenty minutes. This is unacceptable!”

My heart races, and my cheeks turn beet red.

He’s incredibly tall; his eyes are blue green. His hair is dark and wild, his face is flawless, his body is pure muscle, and he’s holding a whip.

“Are you even listening to me?” he growls.

I snap out of my daze.

“I don’t think he’s a wolf, Ash. We need to get out of here,” I say to my wolf in my head, slowly backing up towards the door.

“Whoa, I wasn’t trying to scare you. What’s with the trench coat?” he says, walking over and unbuttoning it.

His musky scent makes my world tilt, and I think my mouth is hanging open.

‘Your mouth is hanging open, you need to shut it,’ Ash, my wolf, snickers.

When he’s done with the buttons, he opens my coat. His eyes widen, and he flashes me the sexiest smile.

His scent, the way he looks at me, I suddenly feel dizzy, drunk on him.

My legs get weak, and he catches me.

“Fuck, are you drunk?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“On drugs?”

I shake my head.

“What is it then?”

I smile and touch his hard, muscular chest, but he pulls away.

I brace myself against the wall.

“No touching. It’s bad enough you're not even my type. If you're going to break the rules, I’m going to have to spank you.”

‘Did he just say he’ll spank you if you break the rules? Quick, touch his chest again,’ Ash begs.

We both love to be spanked. Keith thought it was childish.

Ash takes over and places both hands on his chest, and we lean against his rock hard muscles, and the guy looks at me in surprise.

I slide my hand down over his abs, and he tenses but doesn’t move.

“I’ve been naughty. Spank me,” I smile mischievously.

He yanks off my trench coat, puts me over his lap on the bed, and spanks me with his whip. 

Oddly, he’s gentle with it.

When he’s done, I grab him and kiss him quickly on the lips.

Over his lap I go again. This time he’s angry about my defiance and spanks me harder with his hand.

I’m in absolute heaven when I feel him graze my tiny bikini bottoms.

“Are you wet from me spanking you?” he growls.

I don’t answer.

He spanks me harder. I try not to moan in pleasure.”

I’m a weirdo. I know.

“I’ve gone over my twenty minutes. I have to go,” he says, letting me up.

I dive on him with my whole body and kiss him and bite his bottom lip.

I jump off him, grab my trench coat, fly out the door, and slam right into Ella.

“Run!” I yell at the top of my lungs, grabbing her arm and pulling her along with me.

We run for our lives, like I just left the scene of a crime. Pushing ourselves as fast as we can down the hall, and hide panting behind the stairwell door.

“Wait. Why are we running? Why is your ass bright red?”

I cover her mouth, shove her face into the tiny window on the stairwell door, and we watch him come out of his room.

“Oh my God, look at that ass,” she says as we watch him walk down the hall to the elevator, pushing the button and glaring at his watch. “Did you hire a male escort?” 

“No, I walked into what I thought was your room, and he thought I was there to service him.”

“Wait, you just pimped yourself out?” Ella says, shocked.

“No, he just took off my trench coat, said I wasn’t his type, and spanked me when I touched his chest.”

“You what?”

“It was Ash’s idea. He only had twenty minutes, and I wanted a good spanking,” I smile, putting back on the trench coat.

“You can’t go swimming with a red ass.” 

“Good, I'm starved. Let's eat. I’ll change and…”

“No, I was looking forward to the pool. I’ll buy lunch, you wear the trench coat,” she demands.

She pulls my hair out of the bun in the elevator and walks arm in arm with me like I’m her girlfriend into the restaurant.

“You’re having steak and potatoes,” she says.

“No, a salad.” 

“Ivy, you're wasting away. Did Keith even let you eat?”

“He likes his women small and skinny.”

“You’re practically a bone rack.”

“Fine, order me whatever as long as it comes with a coffee,” I say.

“Oh, no.”

“What wrong?” I ask her.

“Your client is here. Looks like he’s in a meeting.”

“He’s not my client. He didn’t pay me,” I hiss.

“Like you would tell me if you did.”

“Just drop it. I walked into the wrong room, and he had a whip, and I couldn’t leave until he punished me. Just let it go,” I say.

“Do you realize how insane you sound,” she points out.

I whip open my trench coat. “No, this dental floss bikini is the only insane thing here.”

I look over, and the waiter is standing there, checking me out slowly, head to toe.

I shut my trench coat.

“Flash me for thirty seconds, and your meal is on me,” he says.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

“Happy Accident”

POV Ivy

I used to be fun, untamed, crazy, and the life of the party.

Then I met Keith, and within five years I turned into a doormat. 

The moment I found Keith's second hidden phone with my cousin Linsey naked on the screen, my entire world turned upside down.

I was done. I had shed my last tear, and it was time to move on from that asshole.

I phoned my best friend, Ella Shepherd. 

She dropped everything and insisted we go away for a girls’ week.

Now I’m in Vegas with Ella, trying to forget my shattered life.

“Ella, this bathing suit is practically dental floss with tiny triangles over my nipples.”

“You said you wanted the Vegas experience.”

“Yeah, in baby steps, not straight from good girl to hooker,” I point out.

“It’s a three thousand dollar bikini, Ivy, not some trashy hooker outfit,” Ella says.

‘Just wear your trench coat to the pool, then jump in the water quickly and hope it doesn’t fall apart,’ my wolf Ash teases me.

I head to my hotel room two doors down from hers.

After putting it on, I look in the mirror and feel beyond mortified.

‘All you need is a stripper pole,’ Ash chuckles.

I instantly grab my trench coat and hide my body. 

At least I’m wearing the bikini. Baby steps…

Behind this unique concept is Ms. **Tricia T**., PH’s visionary CEO, who (you guessed right) is a lifelong perfume connoisseur.



Recognizing that coffee beans are natural scent neutralizers for perfume testing, Ms. Tricia saw an opportunity to create more than a perfume hub. She imagined a space where fragrance and coffee could coexist. Her vision gave birth to *Perfume Hub + Café,* a destination where scent exploration meets the warmth of freshly brewed coffee, elevating the experience of both. It’s the newest branch, which opened in August 2025.

You were passionate about fast cars, bonfires, and wrenching in the garage. On the other hand, I loved reading, exploring new shops in town, listening to music, and was generally a homebody. Together, we introduced each other to new experiences. You taught me how to change a tire and change my oil, while I showed you my favorite coffee and how to relax in a field. As the year progressed, our love for each other only grew stronger. I yearned for you your presence more and more. You loved me in ways I had never imagined, understanding my needs and desires perfectly. From a gentle squeeze of my hand when I was feeling overwhelmed to encouraging me to step out of my comfort zone when I needed a nudge, I could always count on you to catch me if I fell. Everybody in town was always smitten with you, yearning to experience what I knew so well. They would throw themselves at you, sending their numbers to you even when they thought I wouldn’t notice. Despite all this, you always made it clear that your love was for me alone. 

For a while, I noticed that you had been acting differently, but if you wanted to talk about it, you would have brought it up. I would lie on your chest quietly and let you twirl my hair in your fingers while you listened to your music. I would text you, filling you in on what I was doing when you said you were too busy. We went a week without seeing each other, and soon enough, it was a month. I received short texts here and there, but there was something amiss. I decided to bake your favorite cupcakes, hoping to stop by the shop to see you, but when I pulled up, I saw a car I recognized too well. With tears streaming down my face, I dropped the cupcakes and walked out. I drove and drove until I pulled over on the side of the highway to cry. My phone was flooded with messages and missed calls, but I blocked your number. I didn’t want an explanation; I wanted nothing from you.

Six years later, I’m returning to my hometown. I had moved away after the heartbreak and decided that I needed to achieve my dreams on my own. I became a model and had a house in the woods by the river. My quiet place away from the city. My parents had been nagging me about coming back home to visit, but after years of procrastination, I couldn’t put it off any longer. I had been avoiding town because of a foolish high school love story. I had decided to meet up with some old friends at the local spot, unaware that you frequented it every Friday.

“Happy Accident”

POV Ivy

I used to be fun, untamed, crazy, and the life of the party.

Then I met Keith, and within five years I turned into a doormat. 

The moment I found Keith's second hidden phone with my cousin Linsey naked on the screen, my entire world turned upside down.

I was done. I had shed my last tear, and it was time to move on from that asshole.

I phoned my best friend, Ella Shepherd. 

She dropped everything and insisted we go away for a girls’ week.

Now I’m in Vegas with Ella, trying to forget my shattered life.

“Ella, this bathing suit is practically dental floss with tiny triangles over my nipples.”

“You said you wanted the Vegas experience.”

“Yeah, in baby steps, not straight from good girl to hooker,” I point out.

“It’s a three thousand dollar bikini, Ivy, not some trashy hooker outfit,” Ella says.

‘Just wear your trench coat to the pool, then jump in the water quickly and hope it doesn’t fall apart,’ my wolf Ash teases me.

I head to my hotel room two doors down from hers.

After putting it on, I look in the mirror and feel beyond mortified.

‘All you need is a stripper pole,’ Ash chuckles.

I instantly grab my trench coat and hide my body. 

At least I’m wearing the bikini. Baby steps…

I put my dark hair in a bun and bravely step out into the hallway.

‘Relax, you're the only one who knows what’s under the trench coat,’ Ash teases.

I make it as far as the elevator, wimp out, and knock on Ella’s door. 

When I knock, the door just opens. The latch is keeping it from closing.

I guess she knew I would be back. 

I walk in slowly.

“Listen, I think…”

“Yes,” a shirtless god of a man says, standing there like he’s expecting me. “You’re fucking an hour late. Now I have no time to fuck you. I have a meeting in twenty minutes. This is unacceptable!”

My heart races, and my cheeks turn beet red.

He’s incredibly tall; his eyes are blue green. His hair is dark and wild, his face is flawless, his body is pure muscle, and he’s holding a whip.

“Are you even listening to me?” he growls.

I snap out of my daze.

“I don’t think he’s a wolf, Ash. We need to get out of here,” I say to my wolf in my head, slowly backing up towards the door.

“Whoa, I wasn’t trying to scare you. What’s with the trench coat?” he says, walking over and unbuttoning it.

His musky scent makes my world tilt, and I think my mouth is hanging open.

‘Your mouth is hanging open, you need to shut it,’ Ash, my wolf, snickers.

When he’s done with the buttons, he opens my coat. His eyes widen, and he flashes me the sexiest smile.

His scent, the way he looks at me, I suddenly feel dizzy, drunk on him.

My legs get weak, and he catches me.

“Fuck, are you drunk?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“On drugs?”

I shake my head.

“What is it then?”

I smile and touch his hard, muscular chest, but he pulls away.

I brace myself against the wall.

“No touching. It’s bad enough you're not even my type. If you're going to break the rules, I’m going to have to spank you.”

‘Did he just say he’ll spank you if you break the rules? Quick, touch his chest again,’ Ash begs.

We both love to be spanked. Keith thought it was childish.

Ash takes over and places both hands on his chest, and we lean against his rock hard muscles, and the guy looks at me in surprise.

I slide my hand down over his abs, and he tenses but doesn’t move.

“I’ve been naughty. Spank me,” I smile mischievously.

He yanks off my trench coat, puts me over his lap on the bed, and spanks me with his whip. 

Oddly, he’s gentle with it.

When he’s done, I grab him and kiss him quickly on the lips.

Over his lap I go again. This time he’s angry about my defiance and spanks me harder with his hand.

I’m in absolute heaven when I feel him graze my tiny bikini bottoms.

“Are you wet from me spanking you?” he growls.

I don’t answer.

He spanks me harder. I try not to moan in pleasure.”

I’m a weirdo. I know.

“I’ve gone over my twenty minutes. I have to go,” he says, letting me up.

I dive on him with my whole body and kiss him and bite his bottom lip.

I jump off him, grab my trench coat, fly out the door, and slam right into Ella.

“Run!” I yell at the top of my lungs, grabbing her arm and pulling her along with me.

We run for our lives, like I just left the scene of a crime. Pushing ourselves as fast as we can down the hall, and hide panting behind the stairwell door.

“Wait. Why are we running? Why is your ass bright red?”

I cover her mouth, shove her face into the tiny window on the stairwell door, and we watch him come out of his room.

“Oh my God, look at that ass,” she says as we watch him walk down the hall to the elevator, pushing the button and glaring at his watch. “Did you hire a male escort?” 

“No, I walked into what I thought was your room, and he thought I was there to service him.”

“Wait, you just pimped yourself out?” Ella says, shocked.

“No, he just took off my trench coat, said I wasn’t his type, and spanked me when I touched his chest.”

“You what?”

“It was Ash’s idea. He only had twenty minutes, and I wanted a good spanking,” I smile, putting back on the trench coat.

“You can’t go swimming with a red ass.” 

“Good, I'm starved. Let's eat. I’ll change and…”

“No, I was looking forward to the pool. I’ll buy lunch, you wear the trench coat,” she demands.

She pulls my hair out of the bun in the elevator and walks arm in arm with me like I’m her girlfriend into the restaurant.

“You’re having steak and potatoes,” she says.

“No, a salad.” 

“Ivy, you're wasting away. Did Keith even let you eat?”

“He likes his women small and skinny.”

“You’re practically a bone rack.”

“Fine, order me whatever as long as it comes with a coffee,” I say.

“Oh, no.”

“What wrong?” I ask her.

“Your client is here. Looks like he’s in a meeting.”

“He’s not my client. He didn’t pay me,” I hiss.

“Like you would tell me if you did.”

“Just drop it. I walked into the wrong room, and he had a whip, and I couldn’t leave until he punished me. Just let it go,” I say.

“Do you realize how insane you sound,” she points out.

I whip open my trench coat. “No, this dental floss bikini is the only insane thing here.”

I look over, and the waiter is standing there, checking me out slowly, head to toe.

I shut my trench coat.

“Flash me for thirty seconds, and your meal is on me,” he says.

The problem with hot brew is that the coffee is bitter. I am hoping this would make the coffee more complex with the flavor and not bitter. There is one major problem with this that makes me think this may be an awful idea, one word bacteria.

I was done. I had shed my last tear, and it was time to move on from that asshole.

I phoned my best friend, Ella Shepherd. 

She dropped everything and insisted we go away for a girls’ week.

Now I’m in Vegas with Ella, trying to forget my shattered life.

“Ella, this bathing suit is practically dental floss with tiny triangles over my nipples.”

“You said you wanted the Vegas experience.”

“Yeah, in baby steps, not straight from good girl to hooker,” I point out.

“It’s a three thousand dollar bikini, Ivy, not some trashy hooker outfit,” Ella says.

‘Just wear your trench coat to the pool, then jump in the water quickly and hope it doesn’t fall apart,’ my wolf Ash teases me.

I head to my hotel room two doors down from hers.

After putting it on, I look in the mirror and feel beyond mortified.

‘All you need is a stripper pole,’ Ash chuckles.

I instantly grab my trench coat and hide my body. 

At least I’m wearing the bikini. Baby steps…

I put my dark hair in a bun and bravely step out into the hallway.

‘Relax, you're the only one who knows what’s under the trench coat,’ Ash teases.

I make it as far as the elevator, wimp out, and knock on Ella’s door. 

When I knock, the door just opens. The latch is keeping it from closing.

I guess she knew I would be back. 

I walk in slowly.

“Listen, I think…”

“Yes,” a shirtless god of a man says, standing there like he’s expecting me. “You’re fucking an hour late. Now I have no time to fuck you. I have a meeting in twenty minutes. This is unacceptable!”

My heart races, and my cheeks turn beet red.

He’s incredibly tall; his eyes are blue green. His hair is dark and wild, his face is flawless, his body is pure muscle, and he’s holding a whip.

“Are you even listening to me?” he growls.

I snap out of my daze.

“I don’t think he’s a wolf, Ash. We need to get out of here,” I say to my wolf in my head, slowly backing up towards the door.

“Whoa, I wasn’t trying to scare you. What’s with the trench coat?” he says, walking over and unbuttoning it.

His musky scent makes my world tilt, and I think my mouth is hanging open.

‘Your mouth is hanging open, you need to shut it,’ Ash, my wolf, snickers.

When he’s done with the buttons, he opens my coat. His eyes widen, and he flashes me the sexiest smile.

His scent, the way he looks at me, I suddenly feel dizzy, drunk on him.

My legs get weak, and he catches me.

“Fuck, are you drunk?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“On drugs?”

I shake my head.

“What is it then?”

I smile and touch his hard, muscular chest, but he pulls away.

I brace myself against the wall.

“No touching. It’s bad enough you're not even my type. If you're going to break the rules, I’m going to have to spank you.”

‘Did he just say he’ll spank you if you break the rules? Quick, touch his chest again,’ Ash begs.

We both love to be spanked. Keith thought it was childish.

Ash takes over and places both hands on his chest, and we lean against his rock hard muscles, and the guy looks at me in surprise.

I slide my hand down over his abs, and he tenses but doesn’t move.

“I’ve been naughty. Spank me,” I smile mischievously.

He yanks off my trench coat, puts me over his lap on the bed, and spanks me with his whip. 

Oddly, he’s gentle with it.

When he’s done, I grab him and kiss him quickly on the lips.

Over his lap I go again. This time he’s angry about my defiance and spanks me harder with his hand.

I’m in absolute heaven when I feel him graze my tiny bikini bottoms.

“Are you wet from me spanking you?” he growls.

I don’t answer.

He spanks me harder. I try not to moan in pleasure.”

I’m a weirdo. I know.

“I’ve gone over my twenty minutes. I have to go,” he says, letting me up.

I dive on him with my whole body and kiss him and bite his bottom lip.

I jump off him, grab my trench coat, fly out the door, and slam right into Ella.

“Run!” I yell at the top of my lungs, grabbing her arm and pulling her along with me.

We run for our lives, like I just left the scene of a crime. Pushing ourselves as fast as we can down the hall, and hide panting behind the stairwell door.

“Wait. Why are we running? Why is your ass bright red?”

I cover her mouth, shove her face into the tiny window on the stairwell door, and we watch him come out of his room.

“Oh my God, look at that ass,” she says as we watch him walk down the hall to the elevator, pushing the button and glaring at his watch. “Did you hire a male escort?” 

“No, I walked into what I thought was your room, and he thought I was there to service him.”

“Wait, you just pimped yourself out?” Ella says, shocked.

“No, he just took off my trench coat, said I wasn’t his type, and spanked me when I touched his chest.”

“You what?”

“It was Ash’s idea. He only had twenty minutes, and I wanted a good spanking,” I smile, putting back on the trench coat.

“You can’t go swimming with a red ass.” 

“Good, I'm starved. Let's eat. I’ll change and…”

“No, I was looking forward to the pool. I’ll buy lunch, you wear the trench coat,” she demands.

She pulls my hair out of the bun in the elevator and walks arm in arm with me like I’m her girlfriend into the restaurant.

“You’re having steak and potatoes,” she says.

“No, a salad.” 

“Ivy, you're wasting away. Did Keith even let you eat?”

“He likes his women small and skinny.”

“You’re practically a bone rack.”

“Fine, order me whatever as long as it comes with a coffee,” I say.

“Oh, no.”

“What wrong?” I ask her.

“Your client is here. Looks like he’s in a meeting.”

“He’s not my client. He didn’t pay me,” I hiss.

“Like you would tell me if you did.”

“Just drop it. I walked into the wrong room, and he had a whip, and I couldn’t leave until he punished me. Just let it go,” I say.

“Do you realize how insane you sound,” she points out.

I whip open my trench coat. “No, this dental floss bikini is the only insane thing here.”

I look over, and the waiter is standing there, checking me out slowly, head to toe.

I shut my trench coat.

“Flash me for thirty seconds, and your meal is on me,” he says.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

“Happy Accident”

POV Ivy

I used to be fun, untamed, crazy, and the life of the party.

Then I met Keith, and within five years I turned into a doormat. 

The moment I found Keith's second hidden phone with my cousin Linsey naked on the screen, my entire world turned upside down.

I was done. I had shed my last tear, and it was time to move on from that asshole.

I phoned my best friend, Ella Shepherd. 

She dropped everything and insisted we go away for a girls’ week.

Now I’m in Vegas with Ella, trying to forget my shattered life.

“Ella, this bathing suit is practically dental floss with tiny triangles over my nipples.”

“You said you wanted the Vegas experience.”

“Yeah, in baby steps, not straight from good girl to hooker,” I point out.

“It’s a three thousand dollar bikini, Ivy, not some trashy hooker outfit,” Ella says.

‘Just wear your trench coat to the pool, then jump in the water quickly and hope it doesn’t fall apart,’ my wolf Ash teases me.

I head to my hotel room two doors down from hers.

After putting it on, I look in the mirror and feel beyond mortified.

‘All you need is a stripper pole,’ Ash chuckles.

I instantly grab my trench coat and hide my body. 

At least I’m wearing the bikini. Baby steps…

I put my dark hair in a bun and bravely step out into the hallway.

‘Relax, you're the only one who knows what’s under the trench coat,’ Ash teases.

I make it as far as the elevator, wimp out, and knock on Ella’s door. 

When I knock, the door just opens. The latch is keeping it from closing.

I guess she knew I would be back. 

I walk in slowly.

“Listen, I think…”

“Yes,” a shirtless god of a man says, standing there like he’s expecting me. “You’re fucking an hour late. Now I have no time to fuck you. I have a meeting in twenty minutes. This is unacceptable!”

My heart races, and my cheeks turn beet red.

He’s incredibly tall; his eyes are blue green. His hair is dark and wild, his face is flawless, his body is pure muscle, and he’s holding a whip.

“Are you even listening to me?” he growls.

I snap out of my daze.

“I don’t think he’s a wolf, Ash. We need to get out of here,” I say to my wolf in my head, slowly backing up towards the door.

“Whoa, I wasn’t trying to scare you. What’s with the trench coat?” he says, walking over and unbuttoning it.

His musky scent makes my world tilt, and I think my mouth is hanging open.

‘Your mouth is hanging open, you need to shut it,’ Ash, my wolf, snickers.

When he’s done with the buttons, he opens my coat. His eyes widen, and he flashes me the sexiest smile.

His scent, the way he looks at me, I suddenly feel dizzy, drunk on him.

My legs get weak, and he catches me.

“Fuck, are you drunk?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“On drugs?”

I shake my head.

“What is it then?”

I smile and touch his hard, muscular chest, but he pulls away.

I brace myself against the wall.

“No touching. It’s bad enough you're not even my type. If you're going to break the rules, I’m going to have to spank you.”

‘Did he just say he’ll spank you if you break the rules? Quick, touch his chest again,’ Ash begs.

We both love to be spanked. Keith thought it was childish.

Ash takes over and places both hands on his chest, and we lean against his rock hard muscles, and the guy looks at me in surprise.

I slide my hand down over his abs, and he tenses but doesn’t move.

“I’ve been naughty. Spank me,” I smile mischievously.

He yanks off my trench coat, puts me over his lap on the bed, and spanks me with his whip. 

Oddly, he’s gentle with it.

When he’s done, I grab him and kiss him quickly on the lips.

Over his lap I go again. This time he’s angry about my defiance and spanks me harder with his hand.

I’m in absolute heaven when I feel him graze my tiny bikini bottoms.

“Are you wet from me spanking you?” he growls.

I don’t answer.

He spanks me harder. I try not to moan in pleasure.”

I’m a weirdo. I know.

“I’ve gone over my twenty minutes. I have to go,” he says, letting me up.

I dive on him with my whole body and kiss him and bite his bottom lip.

I jump off him, grab my trench coat, fly out the door, and slam right into Ella.

“Run!” I yell at the top of my lungs, grabbing her arm and pulling her along with me.

We run for our lives, like I just left the scene of a crime. Pushing ourselves as fast as we can down the hall, and hide panting behind the stairwell door.

“Wait. Why are we running? Why is your ass bright red?”

I cover her mouth, shove her face into the tiny window on the stairwell door, and we watch him come out of his room.

“Oh my God, look at that ass,” she says as we watch him walk down the hall to the elevator, pushing the button and glaring at his watch. “Did you hire a male escort?” 

“No, I walked into what I thought was your room, and he thought I was there to service him.”

“Wait, you just pimped yourself out?” Ella says, shocked.

“No, he just took off my trench coat, said I wasn’t his type, and spanked me when I touched his chest.”

“You what?”

“It was Ash’s idea. He only had twenty minutes, and I wanted a good spanking,” I smile, putting back on the trench coat.

“You can’t go swimming with a red ass.” 

“Good, I'm starved. Let's eat. I’ll change and…”

“No, I was looking forward to the pool. I’ll buy lunch, you wear the trench coat,” she demands.

She pulls my hair out of the bun in the elevator and walks arm in arm with me like I’m her girlfriend into the restaurant.

“You’re having steak and potatoes,” she says.

“No, a salad.” 

“Ivy, you're wasting away. Did Keith even let you eat?”

“He likes his women small and skinny.”

“You’re practically a bone rack.”

“Fine, order me whatever as long as it comes with a coffee,” I say.

“Oh, no.”

“What wrong?” I ask her.

“Your client is here. Looks like he’s in a meeting.”

“He’s not my client. He didn’t pay me,” I hiss.

“Like you would tell me if you did.”

“Just drop it. I walked into the wrong room, and he had a whip, and I couldn’t leave until he punished me. Just let it go,” I say.

“Do you realize how insane you sound,” she points out.

I whip open my trench coat. “No, this dental floss bikini is the only insane thing here.”

I look over, and the waiter is standing there, checking me out slowly, head to toe.

I shut my trench coat.

“Flash me for thirty seconds, and your meal is on me,” he says.

Located in the US but for the last couple of years, every time I drink the tiniest bit of Organic Valley milk, it hits me so hard every time. I have no issue with other brands of milk (supermarket brands, fancy local farms, etc.) but with this brand specifically, it wrecks me. The first time I bought the milk, I thought I was the only one in my home to catch food poisoning for a week despite my husband eating the exact same stuff as me.

My work now stocks this milk in the kitchenette for coffee. I was hesitant when I saw the milk this morning but it had been over a year since I had it so I figured I'd try a splash of it. I used the tiniest splash this around 10:30am, and by early afternoon, I was dropping things suddenly and running to the bathroom. Normally my stomach is pretty sturdy and not bothered by much.

Or is it some other type of scam?,"I'm alone in a new-ish town. I moved here 2 years ago when I got married, but my husband turned out to be a narcissistic abuser. I have my own apartment separate from him, and we sort of have an ""on and off relationship."" There were a few times that I thought I was going to make a friend and it fizzled out:

We were apart during most of December because he kicked me out of his place for some imagined slight. I found a local Facebook group for women in my town, and posted a message there, briefly telling my situation and asking if anyone knew of a restaurant open on Christmas Day. I got a few responses including a woman who said she had also been in a narcissistic relationship and knew what I was going through. Then she sent me a DM asking if I'd like to get together for lunch sometime and we could vent about our shared experiences. I said that sounded great, and mentioned a few possible dates. She wrote back, ""OK, how about we meet at the Panera near XYZ."" Except, being a newbie to the town I wasn't too familiar with the location she mentioned, so I wrote back to clarify which Panera location she meant. No reply. A week went by and I wrote back again asking if she still wanted to get together. No reply.

My husband and I sort of ""made up"" after Christmas, but then had another fight in February. So he punished me by backing out of the weekend plans we had for Valentine's Day. So again I was alone at my apartment, and posted to that Facebook women's group asking if anyone knew of any interesting events happening in town this weekend. Someone left a comment about how ""it sounds like you could use a friend"" and that I could DM her. So I sent her a message and she suggested we get together for coffee. (This was on Saturday or Sunday.) Over the next day or two, we wrote back and forth a little about what type of place we wanted to go to, and I let her know when I'd be available this week, and she said, ""OK, I can do something next weekend, maybe Friday afternoon or evening, or else sometime on Saturday?"" I wrote back to say I could do Friday or Saturday evening. No reply.

Why would people do this? I don't understand the purpose of messaging someone and pretending to want to befriend them, and then ghost them when they take you up on it. Now I feel worse than I would if these women had never messaged me in the first place. :(  Is this part of some kind of scam?",1,1771400046.0,lonely,1,1.0,False

Let’s start at the beginning and I will go over if as fast as I can. 

When I was a child and my parents where still married they had friends that had kids same age as me and my brother. 

We did everything together camping, summerhouse dinners and all in all we where extremely happy. 

My moms friend was her best friend and they could talk for hours on the phone and they did everything together. 

When I was in my early teens my mom and dad sit down with me and tell me that they are going to divorce. 

My brother is 5 years older then me so he moved out with my dad and me and my mom stayed at our house while they where selling it. 

My life took a 360 and my mom started to party every weekend and my home ended up being a party place for me and my friends because there was never any adult there. 

When my parents sold the house me and my mom moved in to a cute little apartment in our capital city and our life was ok but my moms partying did not stop and in the end I decided to move out and this time I’m still a teenager and my moms partying did was not happy about it. 

I moved with my x boyfriend to a really small town 800km away from her and she cried for 3 days before I left. 

My x boyfriend was not a nice person and he was mentally and fiscally abusing me so I was going back and forward to my moms and my ex. 

In this time my mom met my stepdad and she was happy and when I moved back home he was living with her so I felt like I was in the way of there relationship and I always felt frustration from him for moving back home and at this time my mom had completely stopped talking to her best friend and she never wanted to tell me why. 

In the end they moved and at that time I was not living with her but she made a small room for me there and when I moved home i always gave up because I never felt welcome there. 

I moved out and started to party a lot and started to do drugs and had huge problems because of that drug use. 

In 2003 I found out I was pregnant and I turned my life around and 2004 my daughter was born. 

At this time my mom and he where living in the other side of our country and my mom moved me and my new born there so she could help me but I never felt welcome so 3 months later I gave up and moved back to our capital. 

Long story short from that time I never really felt welcome when I went to see my mom and they never included me ore my brother in there plans it was always just his kids and there spouses. 

My brother did not really care but I was always hurt because of this because I felt like he was trying to delete us from her life. 

Ok let’s get to the point. 

In the end of April my mom got diagnosed with terminal cancer and I tried my best to help her and take her to her chemo and doctors appointments because he was working. 

My mom was doing ok and we had big hopes that she would be with us for years. 

In November she had the first scan and there came the shock the cancer had spread and it was everywhere. 

This was my grandmothers birthday and I had taken her to see my mom but when we walk in my mom is on the phone in the other room. 

Me and my grandma sit down in the kitchen and I make us coffee and we are waiting for my mom. 

She comes out and immediately I saw on her face

The news was not good. 

She tells us the news and my heart just broke and my grandmother just sat there crying. 

The doctor gave her only 5% chances of the cancer not spreading if she would have more chemo and later that night I called her and told her that we love her but if she decides to not have more chemotherapy I would understand because the chemo had been making her really sick. 

She told me they already decided on stopping the chemo. 

From there everything happened really fast she stopped being able to walk on her own and was just bound to her bed. 

From there I contacted my childhood friend that I had not talked to for years to let her know and she told me her mom had never wanted to talk about what happened but my mom had tried to reconcile years ago but her friend had said she was not interested in it. 

I decided to call her and we talked for probably a hour but she never told me what happened but I asked her if she would be interested in coming with me to see my mom and she said yes. 

I went to my moms and talked to her in private and asked her if it was ok if her friend would come with me to see her and she said yes. 

Two days later we went there together and my stepdad was furious but the smile on my moms face made it all worth it. 

They were sitting there and talking for maybe 30 minutes and my mom was smiling for the first time in a long time. 

Later that night I call her like I always did but she had gone from extremely happy to angry and she told me I had to learn to mind my own business. 

I knew in my heart that he had started to nag in her about this after we left there home. 

This is the last time I heard her voice. 

This is on Friday and on Sunday we where all called to her home to be with her and on Tuesday she passed away peacefully in there home with me and my grandma there with her. 

They had a will saying he could sit on all there assets  and it would not be divided until he was dead. 

I was not really happy with that because I have no interest in being in any contract with him but this was my moms wish so I stayed quiet. 

But since my mom was passed me and my brother became my grandmothers inheritance and we quickly found out from my grandmother that she had given my mom a lot of money in prepaid inheritance. 

But sins my mom passed away before my grandma this money belonged to me and my brother and he was given a legal document saying that he had to pay this money back to me and my brother. 

Because of the situation between me and my stepdad I had my brother be in complete communication with him and I stayed on the sidelines. 

I had to go to there home few times to pick up small stuff and i was always nice and friendly with him. 

Me and my brother had talked about going there together to go over my mom’s personal belongings like stuff from her and my dad and my grate grate grandmother but when we talked to him about it he got angry and said that this is something we can do after he dies. 

I had asked him if I could at least have her handwritten cook books because I wanted to make one of the cakes she always made for me when I was a child. 

I went there in the beginning of this week after he told me he had found it and to my surprise I see that he had packed up most of her private stuff and I asked him if it would be ok if I would have her knitting stuff and he looked at me what I did not know you liked to do that (of course not he didn’t know me at all)

And then he tells me he gave it all away to his daughter in law. 

I was devastated that he had started to give her belongings away and not tell us about it and I asked him to at least give me her clothes because she had so many beautiful dresses that I wanted and he said it was no problem he had already planned to throw it all out but if I wanted it I could take it. 

Now he has given away most of her belongings to his daughters in law and I have started to worry that he is going to transfer all of there belongings to his kids so we will not get anything from her. 

So am I the a hole if I hire a lawyer to freeze there belongings and make him pay us our inheritance now?",1,1771399841.0,AITAH,3,0.6,False

On paper, my numbers work. I’m not asking how to cut my lifestyle — I’m comfortable with how I spend. I just need advice on managing cashflow timing because one cutoff always feels tight.

Here’s the breakdown:

**Work expenses (around 20 days/month)**  
₱650/day (transpo + coffee + lunch)  
= ₱14,300/month

**Monthly bills**  
PLDT – ₱1,799  
Parents – ₱5,000  
Dog – ₱1,400  
Debt – ₱8,100  
= ₱16,299

**Other monthly allocations**  
Home upgrades – ₱1,700  
Play money – ₱8,000  
Utilities – ₱2,300  
Grab – ₱3,000  
= ₱15,000

Total monthly expenses: ₱45,599  
Remaining from ₱66,000: ₱20,401

Mathematically, I should still be able to save ₱20k monthly.

The issue is timing.

Most of my bills and debt hit around the same cutoff. So one ₱33k payout gets heavily reduced immediately. Then I use my credit card to float daily expenses. Next cutoff, I pay off the credit — and the cycle continues.

So I'm unable to save. Could be easier once my debt is over which is July this year.

I'm 18F. I just need advice/perspective/support on my situation. im truly sorry if I'm lowkey overreacting 😭

I'm trying to word this all with clarity as this all has kind of come out of left field and just keeps going. for context, I barely have any romantic experience. I've only been rejected in that regard. I struggle badly with anxiety, (you can probably tell because I'm ruminating a lot) I am also sheltered and from that I am naive. people think I'm being taken advantage of in this situation. im scared. I only really started socializing a couple years ago. 

I started really liking this guy in late 2024. he's very passive, well meaning but nervous and awkward, along with sheltered like me. then around this time last year I told him I liked him through a letter because I was so nervous. he didn't reciprocate but really appreciated it. I honestly expected it and was pretty sure he liked someone else. 

I had to go out of town for 6 months. I return home and his family throws a party that a bunch of our mutual friends would also be at. I go and that's where I met his mom. his mom off the bat really liked me but I didn't think much of it. everything was pretty normal. I start seeing him more and more but it was just through mutual friends and events. 

 

well, then suddenly it became his mom inviting me to things. it was once again just stuff with a couple mutual friends though. the guy I like starts acting stranger around me (for example, pointing out random things I'm doing usually leading to a odd compliment, staring at me, pacing around me, always trying to talk to me when he barely tried before, praising me on very small things I do). I still thought nothing of it and thought he was just being friendly. 

then his mom started talking plans of having just me over for stuff. I didn't really think much of it and thought they were just being nice. well then suddenly last month, his mom wanted to get coffee, one on one, just me and her. it sounds so creepy but I swear, it was normal. I didn't feel creeped out in the moment. my mom starts getting concerned, along with a couple of my friends. I start feeling uneasy too. 

I see the guy I like again soon after and he's trying to talk to me but it was so awkward and it had such a nervous energy. he keeps trying to continue the conversation but loses his words and is fidgeting and hard blinking a bunch. that was the last time I saw him. I had to leave town and his mom recently texted me and is trying to plan something when I get back home. I feel really uneasy and confused. I can't tell if there are genuine red flags here because when I ask my friends, they are confused too. 

I'm scared that I'm potentially going to be taken advantage of after what my friends and others have told me that it's weird and creepy. how should I go about this all? do you guys think it's weird? I still really like him and he's a great guy. ",2,1771399014.0,internetparents,3,1.0,False

Not all packaging of coffee beans indicates roast level, though the majority do. How does one then identify this? I understand that a lot can be discerned through the colour of the coffee bean, but I will be honest, sometimes looking at a bean’s colour I could be splitting hairs (the exception here is dark roasted coffee). I ask this with regards to water/brewing temperature ONLY. How do you decide on what temp to brew at if there is not roast level, and let’s say, no additional direction from the roaster on the packaging. Do most of you brew with a standard range for all coffee roast levels e.g. 89-93°C.",1,1771398767.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

**TL;DR:**  If you're Planning for Everest Base Camp Trek? This guide covers real costs ($1,200-$5,000 with breakdown), honest difficulty (7/10), exact training needed (8-12 weeks), complete 14-day itinerary, what to pack, altitude sickness prevention, and how to not get scammed by budget operators. Written by someone who's guided this trek for 10+ years.

PS: I've used LLMs to write better English for me while writing this post (as I am not a native English speaker), but I wrote an entire detailed guide you would need to plan for your trek


---

## Why I'm Writing This

I've been guiding treks in the Himalayas for over a decade, with 100+ Everest Base Camp expeditions under my belt. I've seen first-time trekkers summit Kala Patthar at 70 years old, and I've seen 25-year-old ""fit"" guys turn back at Namche Bazaar because they didn't prepare properly.

Most EBC guides online are either:
- Travel bloggers who did it once and don't know the operational side
- Companies that sugarcoat everything to get bookings
- Reddit posts from 2015 with outdated pricing and logistics

This guide is **everything I wish trekkers knew before showing up in Kathmandu**. No BS - just the real deal.

*(If you want to discuss your specific situation or need help planning, DM me – I'm happy to answer questions or point you to trusted operators. I've seen enough people underprepared or overpaying that I genuinely want folks to have the best experience possible.)*

## How Much Does EBC Actually Cost? (Real Numbers)

Let's cut through the marketing BS. Here's what you'll ACTUALLY spend:

### **Budget Package: $1,200–$1,500**

**What's included:**
- Basic teahouse accommodation (11 nights on trek)
- Kathmandu hotel (2 nights, 3-star standard)
- All meals during trek (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
- English-speaking guide ($35–$45/day wages)
- Porter to carry your duffel bag ($25–$30/day wages)
- Sagarmatha National Park permit ($30)
- Local entry permits ($20)
- Lukla–Kathmandu return flights ($452 per person)
- Airport transfers in Kathmandu

**What's NOT included:**
- Hot showers ($3-5 each)
- WiFi ($5-8/day)
- Drinks and snacks
- Travel insurance
- Tips ($150-200)

### **Standard Package: $1,500–$2,200**

Everything above PLUS:
- Better Kathmandu hotel (4-star)
- More experienced guide (6-7 years minimum)
- Down jacket and sleeping bag rental included
- Pre-trek briefing session
- 24/7 emergency support
- Trip completion certificate
- Better quality teahouses

### **Luxury Package: $2,400–$5,000**

- Premium lodge accommodation throughout
- Private guide and porter
- Helicopter return option from Gorakshep ($4,000 add-on)
- Satellite phone
- Oxygen cylinder and comprehensive first aid
- Porter carries heavier load (15kg vs 10kg)

### **Hidden Costs Everyone Forgets:**

- **Nepal visa:** $50 (get on arrival, bring exact USD cash)
- **Travel insurance with altitude coverage:** $150-250 (NON-NEGOTIABLE – covers 6,000m altitude + helicopter evacuation)
- **Tips for guide/porter:** $150-200 total (this is their main income, don't skip)
- **Hot showers on trek:** $40-60 total if you shower every other day
- **Device charging:** $30-50 (electricity costs money above 4,000m)
- **WiFi:** $50-80 if you need to stay connected
- **Snacks/drinks:** $10-15/day = $150-180 for trek
- **Contingency for Lukla flight delays:** $100-200 (20% chance of 1-2 day delay)
- **Gear you don't own:** $100-300 (or rent in Kathmandu)

### **Total Realistic Budget:**

- **Budget conscious:** $1,800-2,200
- **Standard comfort:** $2,200-2,800
- **Don't worry about money:** $3,500-5,000+

**My advice:** Don't be the cheapest person on the mountain. Companies offering $950 packages are cutting corners on guide experience, safety equipment, or porter wages. This is 5,500m altitude – not the place to save $300.

## How Hard Is It Really? (Difficulty: 7/10)

### **The Brutal Truth:**

**Altitude is the main enemy, not fitness.**

I've guided marathon runners who got wrecked by altitude, and 60-year-olds who crushed it because they took acclimatization seriously. Here's what you're up against:

**Physical demands:**
- **5-8 hours walking per day** for 12 consecutive days
- **Total elevation gain:** ~4,000m cumulative
- **Highest point:** Kala Patthar at 5,545m (Everest Base Camp itself is 5,364m)
- **Oxygen levels:** 50% of sea level at EBC
- **Terrain:** Rocky glacial moraine, suspension bridges, steep climbs
- **Weather:** -20°C nights at Gorakshep, strong winds above 5,000m

**Altitude sickness affects 75% of trekkers** (usually mild – headaches, fatigue, nausea). The standard 14-day itinerary with 2 acclimatization days minimizes this, but you WILL feel it.

### **Hardest Days (In Order):**

1. **Kala Patthar sunrise climb (Day 10):** 4:30 AM start, -15°C, 381m vertical gain in thin air, pitch black with headlamps. Hardest 2 hours of the trek but the best Everest views.

2. **Namche Bazaar climb (Day 3):** 600m elevation gain in final 2 hours, legs burning, first altitude exposure at 3,440m.

3. **Lobuche to Gorakshep to EBC and back (Day 9):** 8-9 hours total, crossing glacial moraine, altitude symptoms kicking in.

4. **Tengboche to Dingboche (Day 6):** Long day, +550m elevation, entering high altitude zone (4,410m).

### **Comparison to Other Treks:**

**Harder than:**
- Annapurna Base Camp (4,130m) – easier altitude
- Langtang Valley (3,870m) – shorter, lower
- Kilimanjaro (5,895m) – EBC is longer but better acclimatization

**Easier than:**
- Everest Three Pass Trek (adds 3 high passes over 5,400m)
- Island Peak (6,189m technical climbing)

**Similar to:**
- Manaslu Circuit (5,106m Larkya La Pass)

### **Can Beginners Do It?**

**YES – if you check these boxes:**

✅ Can hike 6-7 hours with a light daypack (porter carries main bag)  
✅ Good cardiovascular fitness (can run 5K without dying)  
✅ Complete 8-12 week training program (see below)  
✅ No serious heart/lung conditions  
✅ Mental toughness – this is 60% mental, 40% physical  
✅ Follow acclimatization schedule religiously  

**Success rate:** 85-90% of properly prepared trekkers reach EBC.

**Main reasons people turn back:**
- Altitude sickness (preventable with proper acclimatization)
- Under-trained (didn't do cardio prep)
- Rushed itinerary (skipping acclimatization days)
- Bad weather (rare but happens)

---

## Training Program: 8-12 Weeks

**Start AT LEAST 8 weeks before departure.** Your porter carries your duffel (10-12kg), but you need fitness for 5-8 hours daily hiking at altitude with a daypack (5-6kg).

### **Weeks 1-4: Base Building**

**Cardio (4-5x per week):**
- Long hikes: 3-4 hours on weekends with 500m elevation gain
- Stair climbing: 30-45 min with weighted pack (5kg)
- Running/cycling: 45-60 min moderate intensity
- Swimming: 30-40 min continuous

**Strength (2-3x per week):**
- Lunges: 3 sets x 15 per leg
- Squats: 3 sets x 20 (add weight progressively)
- Step-ups: 3 sets x 15 per leg
- Calf raises: 3 sets x 25
- Core work: planks, mountain climbers (3 sets each)

### **Weeks 5-8: Trek-Specific**

**Long Hikes (Every Weekend):**
- Week 5: 5 hours, 700m gain, 8kg pack
- Week 6: 6 hours, 800m gain, 10kg pack
- Week 7: 7 hours, 900m gain, 10kg pack
- Week 8: 4 hours easy (taper week)

**Back-to-Back Training:**
- Hike 4-5 hours Saturday, 3-4 hours Sunday
- Simulates consecutive trekking days
- Focus on recovery: stretching, hydration

**Mental Prep:**
- Train in rain/cold conditions
- One uncomfortable session per week
- Visualize completing the trek

### **Fitness Test Before Booking:**

Can you hike **6 hours with 600m elevation gain carrying 8kg** without being completely destroyed?

- **Yes:** You're ready for EBC
- **No:** You need more training time

### **Training Tips for Flat Areas:**

No mountains nearby? Use:
- **Stadium stairs** with weighted backpack (45-60 min, 3-4x/week)
- **Treadmill at 12-15% incline** (60 min at walking pace)
- **Stair climber machine** at gym
- **Office building stairwells** (climb 20+ floors with pack)

**My recommendation:** October is THE BEST MONTH for EBC – crystal clear views, manageable cold, stable weather.

---

---

#### **Monsoon: June to August**

❌ Heavy daily rain  
❌ Leeches below 3,000m  
❌ Clouds hide mountains  
❌ Landslide risk on Lukla flight path  

Even with 50% discounts, not worth it.

### **Typical Meals:**

**Breakfast:**
- Porridge with honey
- Tibetan bread with jam
- Eggs (fried, scrambled, omelet)
- Pancakes
- French toast

**Water:** Boiled water $1-3/liter (increases with altitude). Buy refills vs plastic bottles.

---

## Guided vs Independent Trek

### **Why You SHOULD Hire a Guide:**

**Safety:**
- Guides recognize altitude sickness symptoms before you do
- Know when to descend or take extra acclimatization
- Handle emergencies (rescue coordination, helicopter evacuation)
- Navigate in fog/snow
- **95% of trekkers use guides**

**Logistics:**
- Book teahouses daily (peak season fills up)
- Handle permit paperwork
- Arrange Lukla flights (complicated during peak season)
- Deal with flight delays/rebookings
- Navigate Manthali airport transfers

**Cultural:**
- Sherpa guides share local knowledge, stories, traditions
- Invitations to local homes
- Monastery/cultural explanations
- Language translation

**Cost-Benefit:**
- Guide + permits + logistics = $600-800
- Independent saves maybe $200-300 but loses ALL above benefits
- **Not worth risk at 5,500m**

---

### **Group vs Private Trek:**

**Group Trek ($1,200-1,500):**
- Share guide with 8-12 people
- Cheaper
- Social experience
- Fixed itinerary

**Private Guided ($1,800-2,500):**
- Personal guide and porter
- Flexible itinerary
- One-on-one attention
- Smaller teahouses
- Recommended for families/older trekkers

---

## How to Choose a Trekking Agency (Don't Get Scammed)

With 800+ trekking companies in Nepal, choosing matters for safety.

### **🚩 RED FLAGS (Avoid):**

❌ Prices below $1,000 (cutting corners on guide experience, insurance, accommodation)  
❌ No verifiable Kathmandu office address  
❌ Can't provide guide credentials/certification  
❌ No emergency evacuation insurance for staff  
❌ Pressure tactics (""last spot available!"")  
❌ Poor English on website (communication will be worse in person)  
❌ No reviews on TripAdvisor/Google  
❌ All 5-star reviews from same month (fake)  

---

### **✅ GREEN FLAGS (Look For):**

**Essential:**
- Licensed by Nepal Tourism Board
- Guide with minimum 5 years EBC experience
- Guide has wilderness first aid certification
- Porter insurance and fair wages ($25-30/day minimum)
- 24/7 emergency Kathmandu contact
- Clear cancellation/refund policy

**Trust Signals:**
- 50+ reviews on TripAdvisor spanning multiple years
- Detailed, transparent pricing breakdown
- Physical office in Kathmandu (not just online)
- Responds to emails within 24 hours
- Doesn't oversell (""best company,"" ""luxury"" for $1,000)
- Written evacuation protocol

**Bonus:**
- Oxygen cylinder + comprehensive first aid
- Satellite phone
- Porter carries lighter load (10kg vs 12kg)
- Itinerary flexibility
- Pre-trek hotel night included

---

### **Questions to Ask Before Booking:**

1. ""What is your guide's name and experience?"" (Need 5+ years, 20+ EBC treks)
2. ""What happens if I get altitude sickness?"" (Should include: rest day, oxygen, descent, evacuation)
3. ""What if Lukla flights delayed?"" (Should cover contingency accommodation)
4. ""Do guides/porters have insurance?"" (Must be YES)
5. ""What's NOT included in price?"" (Transparency test)
6. ""Can I see photos from previous treks?"" (Verify they operate)
7. ""What's cancellation policy?"" (Important for flexibility)

---

### **Budget Recommendation:**

**Don't be cheapest person on the mountain.**

Budget companies:
- Hire inexperienced guides
- Don't carry oxygen
- Book worst teahouses
- Underpay porters
- Cut safety corners

**Spend $1,400-2,000** for reputable company. This is once-in-a-lifetime trek to 5,500m – not where you save $300.

---

## Altitude Sickness: Prevention, Symptoms, Treatment

**75% of EBC trekkers get mild altitude sickness.** Manageable if you recognize symptoms and act quickly.

### **What Causes It:**

Above 3,000m, oxygen drops significantly. Body needs time to adapt (produce red blood cells, increase breathing). Ascend too quickly = sick.

---

### **Symptoms (Mild to Severe):**

**Mild (AMS - Acute Mountain Sickness):**
- Headache (most common)
- Fatigue
- Nausea/loss of appetite
- Dizziness
- Difficulty sleeping
- Shortness of breath during activity

**Moderate:**
- Severe headache not relieved by painkillers
- Vomiting
- Weakness
- Extreme fatigue

**Severe (LIFE-THREATENING - HACE/HAPE):**
- Confusion, irrational behavior
- Difficulty walking
- Severe shortness of breath at rest
- Coughing blood/pink frothy sputum
- Blue lips/fingernails

**If severe symptoms: DESCEND IMMEDIATELY.** Even 300m descent can save life.

---

### **Prevention:**

**1. Acclimatize Properly:**
- Follow ""climb high, sleep low""
- NEVER skip acclimatization days (Day 4 Namche, Day 7 Dingboche)
- Don't rush itinerary

**2. Hydrate Aggressively:**
- 4-5L water per day minimum
- Urine should be clear (yellow = drink more)

**3. Ascend Slowly:**
- ""Pole, pole"" (slowly, slowly)
- Don't race other trekkers
- Don't gain more than 500m sleeping altitude/day above 3,000m

**4. Consider Diamox (acetazolamide):**
- Prescription med that helps acclimatization
- Start 1-2 days before Lukla flight
- Dosage: 125mg twice daily
- Side effects: tingling fingers/toes, frequent urination
- Consult doctor before trek

**5. Sleep with Head Elevated:**
- Use extra pillow or rolled jacket
- Helps breathing at night

**6. Avoid Alcohol and Sleeping Pills:**
- Both suppress breathing
- Worsens altitude adaptation

---

### **Treatment Protocol:**

**Mild symptoms:**
- Rest 4-6 hours
- Drink water
- Ibuprofen/paracetamol for headache
- Light snack
- Guide monitors every 2 hours

**If no improvement after 6 hours:**
- Stay extra day for acclimatization
- Don't ascend until symptoms resolve

**Moderate to Severe:**
- Descend immediately to last sleeping altitude (300-500m lower)
- Administer oxygen (guide carries portable oxygen)
- Dexamethasone injection if severe (guide carries)
- Contact Himalayan Rescue Association in Pheriche
- Arrange helicopter evacuation if worsens

**Helicopter evacuation: $4,000-10,000.** Why altitude-specific insurance is mandatory.

---

### **Lake Louise Score:**

Guide uses this scoring daily:
- Headache: 0-3 points
- Gastrointestinal: 0-3 points
- Fatigue: 0-2 points
- Dizziness: 0-2 points

**Score 3-5:** Mild AMS (monitor, slow ascent)  
**Score 6+:** Moderate AMS (extra day or descend)  

---

## Insurance (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Standard travel insurance does NOT cover EBC. Need specialized high-altitude trekking insurance.

### **What Insurance MUST Cover:**

**Mandatory:**
- **Trekking up to 6,000m altitude** (EBC is 5,364m, Kala Patthar 5,545m)
- **Helicopter evacuation from remote areas** ($4,000-10,000 cost)
- Emergency medical treatment in Nepal
- Repatriation to home country
- 24/7 emergency hotline

**Recommended:**
- Trip cancellation
- Flight delay coverage (Lukla delays common)
- Lost/stolen baggage
- COVID-19 coverage

---

### **Recommended Providers:**

**US/Canada:**
- World Nomads (Adventurous plan) - $150-250 for 2 weeks
- IMG Global - $120-200
- Seven Corners - $150-220

**UK/Europe:**
- BMC (British Mountaineering Council) - £60-90
- Austrian Alpine Club - €60-100
- True Traveller - £80-120

**Australia/NZ:**
- World Nomads (Adventurous) - AUD$200-300
- Cover-More - AUD$180-280

---

**Verify before purchase:**
- Call insurance company: ""Does this cover trekking to 5,545m with helicopter evacuation?""
- Get written confirmation
- Print policy, carry physical copy during trek

**Cost:** Budget $150-300 for comprehensive coverage.

---

## Permits Required

Your agency handles permits, but you provide documents 2-3 weeks before departure.

### **Required Permits:**

**1. Sagarmatha National Park Entry Permit**
- Cost: NPR 3,000 (~$30 USD)
- Issued by: Nepal Tourism Board or park entrance at Monjo
- Required: Passport copy, 2 passport photos

**2. Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality Permit**
- Cost: NPR 2,000 (~$20 USD)
- Issued by: Local municipality office
- Required: Passport copy
- Purpose: Local area entry fee (introduced 2018)

**Total permit cost: $50**

---

### **How Permits Work:**

- Agency obtains using your passport copy
- Checked at:
  - Monjo checkpoint (entering Sagarmatha National Park)
  - Various trail points
- Keep accessible (guide usually carries)
- Non-refundable

---

### **Nepal Tourist Visa:**

Required for all foreign nationals:

**Cost:**
- 15 days: $30 USD
- 30 days: $50 USD
- 90 days: $125 USD

**How to get:**
- **On arrival at Kathmandu airport** (easiest) – bring passport photos + USD cash
- From Nepal embassy in your country
- Online application (still pay on arrival)

**Processing:** 15-30 min at airport (have exact USD, passport photos)

---

## Tipping Guide and Porter

Tipping is customary and expected. Guide/porter earn base wages, but tips are significant income.

### **Standard Guidelines:**

**Group treks (8-12 people sharing guide):**
- Guide: $8-12 USD per day per trekker
- Porter: $6-8 USD per day per trekker
- **For 12-day trek: Budget $150-200 total per person**

**Private treks (personal guide/porter):**
- Guide: $12-15 USD per day
- Porter: $8-10 USD per day
- **For 12-day trek: Budget $200-250 total**

---

### **When and How:**

- **Timing:** End of trek in Lukla or Namche (not Kathmandu)
- **Format:** Cash in USD or Nepali rupees in sealed envelope
- **Ceremony:** At celebration dinner with handshake and thank you
- **Split tips:** Guide helps distribute fairly if multiple porters

---

### **Tip More If:**
- Guide went above and beyond (extra care, emergency handling)
- Porter carried heavier load or helped with personal items
- Bad weather (snow, rain, extreme cold)
- Genuine friendship formed

**Don't skip tipping.** These men spend 12 days from families, carry 20-30kg daily, sleep in cold teahouses, earn $25-45/day base. Your tip = 30-50% of monthly income.

---

## . Risk-to-savings ratio heavily favors hiring guide.

---



**Q: Can I drink tap water?**

A: No. Drink boiled water (buy from teahouses, $1-3/liter) or use water purification tablets/SteriPen. Refill bottles vs buying plastic (reduce waste). Hydration critical at altitude – 4-5L per day minimum.

---

**Q: How cold does it get?**

A: Varies by altitude and season:
- **Namche (3,440m):** 5-15°C day, -5 to 0°C night
- **Dingboche (4,410m):** 0-10°C day, -10 to -5°C night
- **Gorakshep (5,164m):** -5 to 5°C day, -20 to -15°C night

Coldest months: Dec-Feb (add -10°C). Warmest: May-Aug (add +5°C). Wind chill makes it 5-10°C colder.

---

**Q: Can older people (60+) do this?**

A: Yes, if fit and healthy. Age less important than fitness and mental determination. I've seen 70-year-olds summit Kala Patthar and 25-year-olds turn back. For 60+: get medical clearance, consider private guide, add extra acclimatization day in Dingboche, accept slower pace. Oldest recorded: 84 years old.

---

**Q: What about kids? Families?**

A: Possible but not recommended under 12. Altitude affects children differently – can't always communicate symptoms. If bringing kids (12+): private guide mandatory, extra acclimatization days, be prepared to descend if child shows any altitude sickness. Success rate for kids lower (70% vs 90% adults).

---

**Q: Can I rent gear in Kathmandu vs buying?**

A: Yes. Thamel has dozens of rental shops. Down jacket ($1-2/day), sleeping bag ($1-2/day), trekking poles ($0.50-1/day), boots ($2-3/day). Quality varies – inspect carefully. Many agencies include down jacket/sleeping bag in package. Boots should be purchased and broken in before trek (rental causes blisters).

---

**Q: How many trekkers on trail?**

A: Peak season (Mar-May, Sept-Nov): 200-400 trekkers/day from Lukla. Never alone, but doesn't feel crowded – groups spread over 6-8 hour trekking day. Teahouses in popular villages (Namche, Dingboche) can be full – booking ahead helps.

---

**Q: Can I extend trek to other places?**

A: Yes. Popular extensions:
- **Gokyo Lakes + Cho La Pass:** Add 4-6 days, more challenging
- **Three Passes Trek:** Add 8-10 days, technical sections
- **Island Peak climb:** Add 3-4 days, requires climbing experience
- **Helicopter return from EBC:** Save 4-5 days descending ($1,200-1,500/person)

Discuss extensions when booking – requires different permits and itinerary.

---

## Final Advice: Is EBC Worth It?

**YES – if you meet these:**

✅ Reasonably fit (can hike 6-7 hours with breaks)  
✅ Have 16-17 days total (14-day trek + contingency + travel)  
✅ Have $2,500-3,500 budget (trek + flights + gear + extras)  
✅ Fascinated by mountains (if ambivalent about hiking, skip it)  
✅ Okay with discomfort (cold, basic toilets, thin walls, altitude headaches)  

---

**The Payoff:**

- Standing at 5,545m looking at Everest's summit (8,848m)
- 12 days walking through Sherpa villages and Buddhist monasteries
- Crossing suspension bridges over glacial rivers
- Sleeping in teahouses at 5,164m
- Achievement that 1% of people accomplish
- Stories you'll tell for life

---

**This isn't vacation – it's expedition.** You'll be cold, tired, sore, uncomfortable. Nose runs constantly. You'll smell. Sleep in rooms with thin walls and cold floors.

But when you stand on Kala Patthar at sunrise, watching golden light hit Everest's summit, with prayer flags snapping in wind and Khumbu Valley stretching 2,000m below... you'll understand why 35,000 people do this yearly.

---

## Need Help Planning?

**I've guided 100+ EBC treks over the past decade.** I've seen what works, what doesn't, who succeeds, who turns back, which operators are legit, which cut corners.

**If you have questions or want personalized advice, DM me.**

I'm genuinely happy to help because I've seen too many people:
- Underprepared (didn't train, got altitude sick)
- Overpaying (booked $4,000 ""luxury"" when $1,600 would've been identical)
- Booking sketchy operators (inexperienced guides, no safety equipment, underpaid porters)

**I can help with:**
- Evaluating your fitness level honestly
- Recommending trusted operators in your budget range
- Customizing itinerary (extra acclimatization days, private vs group, extensions)
- Training program advice specific to your situation
- Gear recommendations (what to buy vs rent)
- Questions I didn't cover here

**I don't work for any specific company** – I just want people to have the incredible experience EBC can be when done right.

---

**Start training today. Book your trek. Go to Everest Base Camp.**

You won't regret it.

Currently brew with v60 and struggle with consistency of brews, and find that at this volume V60 is not very forgiving (sometimes I get stellar brews, but tiniest changes throw the taste off a lot, and new coffees take a lot of work to dial in).

People have recommended 185 for the same recipe, essentially saying with flatter bed extration would be more even and therefore more forgiving. 

Pulsar seems like it's the biggest thought and can maybe be less of a fuss to brew, and have a slightly hhigher yield due to being no bypass and allowing for higher ratios.

There's also big boy from Orea which seems like it can take similar filters to the 185

Someone would ask “what should we do?”, the group chat would fill with ideas, half the people would say “I’m down for anything”, and nothing ever actually got decided.

So I built an iOS app to fix that.

It’s called What Now?

The idea is simple:

* Create a session
* Invite your friends
* Everyone swipes and votes on food places and activities 
* The group decides together

When the session is live, you can add photos, and it all gets saved to a Memories tab so plans don’t just disappear.

It’s private by default, built around friends (not followers), and meant to be used anytime of day — coffee, dinner, spontaneous plans, whatever.

Would love for people here to check it out if it sounds useful. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.

I did everything by the book... I studied, got good grades, got a degree, got an internship and then a full time job. And I'm not happy. I have nothing in my personal life to look forward to, and my professional life sucks. It's been almost 4 years since I joined corporate and it has slowly sucked the life out of me. I used to be so happy and optimistic. I was a person who genuinely liked to go to school and college. I had so many hobbies, I was so creative. I have absolutely no time or energy for anything anymore. Every week is like clockwork, I wake up, go to the gym, go to office, work, eat, come back home, eat and sleep. Every single day. And then it's weekend, but I barely have the energy to start anything (I can't even start a new movie or tv show cuz I feel so overwhelmed). And before I know it, it's Monday again... And then again. I'm still living with my parents, who aren't super strict but I still hate having to mentally prepare myself for their interrogations every time I want to go out (I'm a girl btw, so of course ig). Its not like I want to party and have boyfriends or anything. I just want to be able to spontaneously do what I want, to go on trip or a trek, or just meet a friend for coffee whenever I want, without having to give a day's notice. And ik they're parents and they are always going to be worried and just want to make sure I'm safe but it's so frustrating. And yes the obvious answer would be to move out, but I can't do that unless I get a job somewhere out of state. And for that I have to get time to prepare for interviews and study. I don't have time or energy for that either. I can't just quit my job cuz the job market is crazy and there's no guarantee I'll find a decent job. I used to be so outgoing and such an extrovert, I barely talk to my friends anymore, I have very few friends at office and I don't talk to anyone new. Some weekends I lie to cancel plans because I feel like it's just too much to be surrounded by people. My love life is non existent, I haven't liked anyone for a long time and I can't even think of dating rn cuz all I want to do is quit my job and move out to some place far far away. But as days go by, even that is seeming impossible. I'm stressed out all the time, my hair started greying and falling out, I barely get good sleep anymore and I'm tired all the time. I feel like I should have been a rebel, should have taken risks and done something crazy instead of getting a job. 
I'm going to be stuck in this loop forever, and it will slowly consume whatever is left of me.",9,1771398548.0,TwentiesIndia,14,0.92,False

Day 1 reality check hit differently.

First, installing Angular CLI already made me feel like I was setting up a mini backend project. Node versions, global installs, creating a workspace — not exactly the “open index.html and code” vibe.

Then I created my first app with ng new and boom — 20+ files and folders. My simple brain was looking for one JS file; Angular gave me a full ecosystem.

Things I experienced on Day 1:

TypeScript everywhere
If you’re coming from plain JS, this is your first surprise. Interfaces, types, decorators — it feels strict but also kinda powerful.

Components are the world
In Angular, everything is a component. Header? Component. Button? Component. Probably my future coffee mug? Also a component.

Modules confusion
NgModules had me staring at the screen like 🤨
“Why do I need to import this here when I already imported it there?”

Data binding magic
{{ }}, property binding, event binding, two-way binding…
When it worked, I felt like a wizard. When it didn’t, I questioned my career.

Folder structure discipline
Angular basically says:
“You will be organized, whether you like it or not.”

Documentation is your best friend
You can’t wing Angular. Googling and reading docs is part of the process.


Biggest realization:
Angular isn’t just a library, it’s a full framework with opinions. It wants structure, patterns, and consistency.

End of Day 1 feelings:

30% confused

30% impressed

40% motivated to continue


But honestly, once you see things connect, it starts making sense.

New restaurants, cafés, hotels, and food chains are opening every day in cities and small towns. With this growth, the demand for high-quality restaurant furniture has also increased. Among many furniture manufacturers, **Best of Exports** has emerged as the No.1 [restaurant tables](https://bestofexports.com/restaurant-furniture/restaurant-tables/) manufacturer in India.

But how did this company achieve such success? What makes it different from others? In this blog, we will explore the journey of Best of Exports and understand how it became a trusted name in the restaurant furniture industry.



# A Strong Beginning with a Clear Vision

Every successful company starts with a strong vision. Best of Exports was founded with a simple goal: to manufacture high-quality restaurant tables that combine durability, style, and affordability.

From the beginning, the company focused only on commercial furniture. Instead of producing all types of furniture, they specialized in restaurant tables and related products. This clear focus helped them understand the needs of restaurant owners better than anyone else.

They studied the market carefully. They observed what restaurant owners wanted — strong tables, stylish designs, easy maintenance, and affordable prices. By understanding customer needs, Best of Exports built a solid foundation for long-term success.



# High-Quality Materials and Manufacturing

One of the main reasons Best of Exports became No.1 is its commitment to quality. In the restaurant business, furniture goes through heavy daily use. Tables must handle weight, spills, heat, and constant cleaning.

Best of Exports uses premium materials such as:

* Solid wood
* Engineered wood
* Stainless steel
* Cast iron bases
* High-pressure laminates
* Marble and stone tops

The company also uses modern machinery and advanced manufacturing techniques. Their factory follows strict quality control at every stage. Each table is carefully checked before delivery.

Because of this focus on quality, their products last longer and require less maintenance. Restaurant owners see this as a smart long-term investment.



# Wide Range of Restaurant Table Designs

Another key factor behind their success is product variety. Restaurants have different themes and interiors. A fine-dining restaurant needs elegant tables, while a café may prefer modern or industrial-style tables.

Best of Exports offers a wide range of options, including:

* Wooden dining tables
* Metal frame tables
* Marble-top tables
* Outdoor restaurant tables
* Bar tables
* Custom-designed tables

This wide selection allows restaurant owners to find the perfect table for their concept. The company also offers customization options, which makes it even more attractive to customers.



# Customization That Meets Every Need

Customization is one of the strongest advantages of Best of Exports. Every restaurant is different. Some need compact tables for small spaces, while others need large tables for family dining.

Best of Exports allows clients to customize:

* Table size
* Shape (round, square, rectangular)
* Color and finish
* Base design
* Material type

This flexibility makes them a preferred partner for restaurant chains and interior designers across India.

Many big hospitality brands choose Best of Exports because they can get furniture made exactly according to their brand guidelines.



# Strong Presence Across India

To become No.1 in India, a company must have strong nationwide reach. Best of Exports has built a wide distribution network that serves clients in major cities like:

* Mumbai
* Delhi
* Bangalore
* Hyderabad
* Chennai
* Pune
* Kolkata

They also supply to smaller cities and towns. Their ability to deliver on time across India has built trust among customers.

Timely delivery is very important in the restaurant industry. When a restaurant is about to open, any delay in furniture can cause huge losses. Best of Exports understands this and ensures smooth logistics and quick dispatch.



# Affordable Pricing Without Compromising Quality

One of the biggest challenges in manufacturing is balancing price and quality. Many companies either offer low prices with low quality or high quality with very high prices.

Best of Exports found the perfect balance.

Because of their large-scale production and efficient manufacturing process, they are able to keep costs under control. They pass this benefit to customers without reducing quality.

This affordable pricing strategy has helped them attract both small restaurant owners and large chains.



# Focus on Innovation and Trends

The restaurant industry keeps changing. New design trends appear every year. Modern customers prefer stylish interiors that look good in photos and on social media.

Best of Exports stays updated with the latest furniture trends. They regularly introduce:

* Minimalist designs
* Industrial-style tables
* Rustic wooden finishes
* Luxury marble tops
* Eco-friendly materials

By staying ahead of trends, they help restaurant owners create attractive dining spaces.

Their design team continuously researches global furniture styles and adapts them for the Indian market.



# Commitment to Customer Satisfaction

A major reason for the company’s success is its customer-first approach. Best of Exports believes that happy customers are the best marketing tool.

They focus on:

* Clear communication
* Transparent pricing
* Fast response to queries
* After-sales support
* Easy bulk order handling

Many customers return for repeat orders because of their smooth buying experience.

Positive word-of-mouth and strong client relationships have played a big role in making Best of Exports the No.1 restaurant tables manufacturer in India.



# Serving Hotels, Cafés, and Large Restaurant Chains

Best of Exports does not only supply to small restaurants. They also work with:

* Large hotel chains
* Fine dining restaurants
* Food courts
* Cafés and coffee shops
* Cloud kitchens
* Bars and lounges

By handling bulk projects and large commercial orders, the company has built strong experience in commercial furniture manufacturing.

Their ability to manage big projects efficiently has given them a competitive advantage over smaller manufacturers.



# Export Quality Standards

As the name suggests, Best of Exports maintains international quality standards. Even though they are based in India, their manufacturing process matches global benchmarks.

Their tables are designed to meet international durability and safety standards. This makes them suitable not only for Indian restaurants but also for export markets.

Their export-quality manufacturing has strengthened their brand image and positioned them as a premium furniture manufacturer.

Logically, I know it doesn't matter. But my brain is currently running a full forensic analysis of every word I said, looking for signs of total social failure.

I’ve struggled with this ""mental noise"" for as long as I can remember. For a while, I thought it was just a personality trait [feelokay.in](http://feelokay.in) like I was just ""the intense one."" But after falling into a massive depression a few years ago, I realized that my overthinking was actually a survival mechanism that had gone totally haywire. I was constantly scanning for threats that didn't exist.

The weirdest realization I’ve had lately is that I’m actually ""addicted to the chaos."" When things are finally calm, I feel itchy. My skin crawls. I start looking for a problem to solve because my brain doesn't know how to function in the quiet. I’ve literally sabotaged good jobs and relationships just because the stability felt ""wrong"".It’s like I’ve lived in a storm for so long that I don't know how to exist in the sun.

Here’s what I’ve learned (the hard way):

* **Thinking isn't doing.** I used to spend hours ""researching"" how to be happy instead of just... doing one thing that made me happy. Researching is just overthinking in a fancy suit.
* **The ""Brain Dump"" is mandatory.** I keep a notepad by my bed. When the ""inner radio"" gets too loud, I write it all down. Seeing the thoughts on paper usually makes them look a lot smaller and more ridiculous than they feel when they’re screaming in my skull.
* **Action over Logic.** When I’m spiraling, I can't ""think"" my way out. I have to move my way out. I go for a walk, I do the dishes, I take a cold shower. Anything to get the energy out of my head and back into my body.

I’m still a mess most days, but I’m a mess that understands why the noise is happening. I’m learning to treat my brain like a well-meaning but incredibly annoying neighbor. ""Thanks for the input, Brenda, but I’m trying to sleep now.""

Does anyone else feel this? Like you’re constantly trying to ""solve"" your own life? How do you guys quiet the radio when it gets too loud?.

1r7vzl7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r7vzl7,"Tesla Optimus: The 400,000 Simulated Years Behind Every Elegant Step","Tesla Optimus: The 400,000 Simulated Years Behind Every Elegant Step

Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robot is no longer just a prototype—it’s a learning machine that’s quietly racking up experience at a scale no human could match. According to internal estimates shared in recent engineering briefings, reaching the next leap in capabilities—from reliable factory work to true general-purpose assistance—will require the equivalent of 400,000 years of simulated experience.

That’s not marketing hype. It’s the raw math of training a brain that must master balance on two legs, delicate finger movements, and adaptive decision-making in unpredictable environments.

Why Simulation Is the Only Way

Real-world training for a humanoid is brutally inefficient. Drop a physical Optimus into a kitchen to learn how to fold laundry, and you risk bent actuators, spilled coffee, and weeks of downtime for repairs. One wrong grip on an egg and the demo is over.

Tesla’s solution? Let thousands of virtual Optimus robots live entire lifetimes inside hyper-realistic simulations every single day.

Using the same physics-accurate “world model” technology that powers Full Self-Driving, Tesla runs millions of parallel simulations on its Dojo supercomputer and massive GPU clusters. In these digital worlds:

	•	Time accelerates dramatically.

	•	Physics can be randomized (slippery floors, gusts of wind, varying object weights).

	•	Every failure is instant feedback.

A single night of simulation can compress months of real-world trial-and-error. Multiply that across 10,000+ virtual instances running 24/7, and the cumulative “robot-years” pile up fast. The 400,000-year figure represents the total equivalent lived experience needed across thousands of diverse skills—pouring liquids without spilling, navigating crowded rooms, handing tools safely to humans, and understanding context like “if the coffee is too hot, wait 30 seconds.”

From Digital Dreams to Real-World Dexterity

Recent demos already show the payoff. Optimus Gen 2 and early Gen 3 prototypes have demonstrated zero-shot transfer: skills learned entirely in simulation work on the first try in the physical world. Folding shirts, sorting battery cells, and walking with natural gait were all trained primarily in simulation before the real robot ever attempted them.

Elon Musk has repeatedly highlighted this approach: “We’re training Optimus the same way we trained the car—billions of miles in simulation, then real-world validation.” The plan includes an “Optimus Academy” where fleets of physical robots will share data and learn from one another, but the heavy lifting will always happen in simulation first.

The Road Ahead

Critics might call 400,000 years an absurd number. In AI terms, it’s actually conservative. Modern language models digest data equivalent to millions of human lifetimes. Humanoid robots need comparable “embodied” experience to handle the messy physical world.

Tesla’s target remains aggressive: thousands of Optimus units in factories by the end of 2025, scaling to millions in the coming decade. Each new generation will build on the previous simulated knowledge base, accelerating progress further.

When Optimus finally pours your morning coffee without hesitation, remember—it didn’t learn that in a few days of practice. It lived 400,000 years perfecting the motion in a digital universe before ever touching a real mug.

The future of work isn’t coming in human time. It’s already been training for millennia—in silicon.",0,1771397650.0,grok,1,0.5,False

1r7vur0,https://www.reddit.com/r/elearning/comments/1r7vur0/completion_rates_for_compliance_training_are/,Completion rates for compliance training are notoriously bad (usually ~30% ) for us. I finally hit 90% this month without chasing people. Here’s what changed.,"We all know the ""Compliance Headache."" Most employees see compliance training as 60 minutes of clicking 'next' while they do actual work. We realized our problem wasn't the content, it was the friction. I stopped forcing people to sit at their desks for an hour and moved everything to a mobile-first approach.

3 things that actually worked for us:

1. **Micro-learning:** We broke those 1-hour tutorials into 5-10 minute ""sprints.""
2. **True Mobile Access:** Not just ""it works in a mobile browser"" but a native mobile app where learners can finish a module while waiting for coffee or commuting.
3. **Automated Nudges:** Instead of we sending reminders via emails, the system tracks progress and sends a push notification only when they’re actually behind.

I’ve been using iSpring LMS for this because the mobile app syncs offline (huge for our field team). But honestly, any LMS that prioritizes UX over ""checkbox features"" will probably see the same jump.

I am curious what’s your ""compliance completion"" strategy? Do you guys find that managers chasing people is the only way or is there a tool I’m missing that handles the automation better?",1,1771397184.0,elearning,0,0.67,False

They'll say to their wives that their coworker is cheating on his wife. When in actuality it's them. It's a sneaky way of admitting to it. I wonder if this occurs amongst people with BPD, like my husband, as I've suspected several times he's done it. For example he told me that his ex was slandered him after he called it off. He said she told people he was dangerous because he was interested in serial killers. Not only was he, by definition, slandering her to me. I was the one interested in serial killers.

I was eventually told negative things by his ex, and his former friend, including that he badmouthed me. He said they both were lying.  He is studying to become a counselor. He told me a while back after the teacher discussing a client they had. A man who was having an online affair, which was emotional in nature, and didn't think he'd done anything wrong. He said he was trying to help the woman. I have, for several years now, suspected my husband has cheated. One of the people I believe he tried to cheat with, and possibly did, was someone he said was in an abusive relationship. 

He seemed to take to women in vulnerable positions, wanting to save, just as he did with me. I wonder now if he was telling on himself. Today he told me the teacher mentioned a client she saw today, one who told her he wasn't attracted to his wife anymore, because of her weight gain. He said she was seeking out attractive female therapists as he wanted their attention. I was overweight when we first met in person, after knowing one another online for years, and though online he said he didn't mind it was a different story in person. He rejected me a lot and everything we did felt forced. 

I lost weight and changed and he showed more interest in me. He said he had OCD prior to that about not finding me attractive. That he didn't tell me because he didn't want to hurt me. And that he thought I'd leave. I never fully believed he was attracted to me. He was on medication he claimed killed his libido but I caught him looking at p*rn and at other women. I regained weight and he stopped showing as much interest in me, blaming it on the meds. However, he insulted me over my weight many times during arguments. He called me fat and ugly and said guys prefer thin women. Hl

He said he didn't mean the insults, that he said them to hurt me, and that I also insulted him over his weight gain. He swore he was still attracted to me but eventually, during an argument, admitted to being more attracted to me when I weighed less. He swore he Soto found me atttractive but there's a lot to suggest he doesn't. And that he's not telling me because it doesn't benefit him to. At the start of the year he started looking for a female therpaist. He found one nearby, an older women, with several qualifications. He said she was likely the one but then he found another. A younger, attractive woman. 

He tossed the other option out of the window, no longer considered it, when this new therapist was over an hour away. He did as I expected he'd do it and used her against me, lying about her saying things, such as that he doesn't have BPD after the first few sessions. He included her a joke I made with him which was partially flirtatious. It felt inappropriate. He told me she recommended coffee places for us to go to. He told me today to message her for him, and call her by her first name abbreviated, but then denied he said that, and that if he did it was a mistake. 

Today he told me she made the same comment I did about something his psychiatrist said, concerning an issue he has, which I crticized and said wasn't professional. He didn't seem to agree with that or take it seriously until he told me she said the same thing. I got frustrated and without saying anything, once he sensed I was bothered, he knew why and insisted it wasn't that he was taking what she says more seriously. It was obvious that he was. Now he tells me his teacher supposedly saw a client today, and what he supposedly shared, which mirrors how I percieve our situation. ",5,1771397150.0,BPDlovedones,0,0.86,False

1r7vq9t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r7vq9t,An attempt at a better AI storytelling platform,"Most tools in this space do a few things well and fall apart elsewhere. I've found that most of the new platforms are locked into one audience and ignores everyone else. [LoreWeaver](https://loreweaverai.com/) exists because I wanted something that does everything, and does it well.

**Actual frontier models:** You get access to the real good stuff. Hermes 4 405B, DeepSeek V3.2 with 64K context on Pro, Trinity with 128K context, Qwen3, GLM-5. I stay up to date on the latest and greatest models, and make sure new players are available day one.

**Memory that doesn't cap out:** The tiered compression system means unlimited memories that automatically condense as they age without losing critical plot points. The memory algorithm learns what matters. Memories that keep getting retrieved get boosted in future searches. Your story teaches the engine what's important. Content hashing prevents duplicate junk from clogging your context. When I say unlimited, I mean actually unlimited and not as a marketing buzzword.

**Lore injection that isn't stupid:** Every lore card has importance weighting (1-5), tags scored against current context, and optional pinning for stuff that's always relevant. When tokens get tight, LoreWeaver preserves important canon first instead of randomly truncating your world.

**Integrated visuals, powered by VoyceMe's SEE Engine:** We partnered with VoyceMe to bring their SEE Engine exclusively into LoreWeaver. It reads your character's actual appearance from their portrait and lore description, then generates scenes that look like them. Image chaining means every image builds on the last, so your character stays on-model across outfits, locations, and poses. In multi-character worlds it automatically detects who the scene is about and pulls the right visual profile. Pro users get Auto Scene Detection, where the AI watches your story and generates images on its own when the moment calls for it. No other platform in this space is doing character-consistent, context-aware, lore-reinforced image generation like this.

**Voice that actually sounds alive:** LoreWeaver runs on the world's #1 TTS engine. Every character can have a fully custom voice built from scratch or fine-tuned to match how you imagine them. Tap call on any character and you're in a real-time voice conversation that feels like you're actually on the phone with them. Their personality, their memories, their voice, all there. It's the closest thing to talking to someone who lives inside your story.

**Story branching:** Your narrative isn't a straight line and LoreWeaver doesn't force it into one. Branch at any decision point and explore alternate paths without losing the original. The branch graph gives you a full node-graph view of every timeline, git-style version control for your narrative. Compare divergent outcomes or just let a ""what if"" run wild without consequence. Every branch carries its own memory and lore state, so nothing bleeds where it shouldn't.

**Adaptive soundtracks:** Livestreamed music that reacts to your story in real time. Mood, tempo, intensity shift as scenes change. Think of it like a dynamic radio with full awareness of what's happening in your narrative.

**LoreMaps:** Node-graph view of your entire world. See all your lore cards at once, visualize how characters, locations, and factions connect, spot gaps in your worldbuilding instantly. This is an actual tool, not decoration.

**Full control if you want it:** Model presets for quick tuning. Full parameter control if you're that kind of nerd.

**Community:** There's a Hub for publishing and discovering worlds and characters. Browse by genre, follow creators, quick-play into anything that catches your eye. Some of you are going to build things way more creative than me. That's the point.

**Content policy** Fiction is fiction. Your story is yours.

**Pricing**

* Free tier: unlimited free model messages with 5 premium messages/day with a model of your choice, as well as 10 minutes per month of Character Calling and 5K characters of TTS. Think of it as sampling the goods.
* Plus: $8/mo
* Pro: $15/mo unlimited with image gen and highest context and TTS limits

**Try it** I'm not claiming this is perfect. I'm claiming it's complete in a way I couldn't find anywhere else.

1r7vojx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1r7vojx/help_what_nespresso_model_for_my_lifestyle/,Help! What Nespresso model for my lifestyle?,"Hi! I'm new to the espresso/nespresso world and have been struggling with finding a model that would fit my needs. 

Little background: I've been a Keurig owner for 10 years and am tired of the watered down artificial taste. Im not a straight espresso person, but a generic Starbucks girl that needs her Iced caramel macchiato and vanilla lattes.

I'm a single mom of a child with ADHD, so my top priority is convenience. I want to press a button, go brush my kiddos hair, and come back to a finished drink (if not, mostly finished) and head out the door.

I'm not even sure whether to choose an original line or Vertuo. I've heard the Vertuo is better for milk based drinks, but has a history of leaking / bad reviews. On the other hand, I've read the original line is better for espresso only (so not for me?), and is more reliable / frequently praised. I've seen the Lattissima, but again, reviews weren't that great and not sure what sub-model would be best. 

Needs: 

* Convenient drink preparation 
* Drink ability: Iced caramel macchiato, vanilla latte, iced coffee, mocha, & cortado (for the husband)

Wants: 

* Convenient cleaning
* Milk frother
* Removable milk tank to store in the fridge.
* Budget around $350-400. Could be around $500 if the thing is absolutely worth it.

Any suggestion on original/vertuo and a specific model would be so greatly appreciated!!! Heck, if you recommend a completely different brand, I'll still be grateful. I just need some good coffee in my life without spending an arm and a leg everyday at the bucks. Thanks in advance!",2,1771396591.0,nespresso,2,1.0,False
