1layijd,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1layijd/had_to_get_on_a_plane_and_its_the_closest_ive/,Had to get on a plane and it‚Äôs the closest I‚Äôve come to breaking in 6 months of not drinking,"Long post but wanted to share my experience- 

So like a lot of people in this thread I used to genuinely enjoy going to the airport and getting drunk before the flight, have another couple while flying and then passing out until I landed.

Last year I broke one of my sobriety stints at the airport for this very reason.

Drinking made time at the airport go fast and it also made me forget my fear of flying which has only worsened with all the accidents in the media lately.

So this Monday I had a flight at noon  to LA to catch. I haven‚Äôt drank since Dec 31st and have not been extremely tempted since. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôve had time where I‚Äôd like to drink like it would be fun but I haven‚Äôt genuinely considered. 

That changed on Sunday the night before my flight. I started telling myself that having a couple drinks before the flight might be OK because I am deathly afraid of flying and I was also flying from Newark New Jersey, which has been in the news quite a lot lately for its lack of safety. On top of the I had lounge access thanks to my credit card and access to feee unlimited alcohol. I genuinely thought thought this might be the end to my abstinence like it all made sense in my head. 1) im genuinely afraid of flying 
2) I‚Äôm flying out of Newark airport which literally been in the news as a safety risk and has had employees warn against flying there 
3) I have access to the lounge and free drinks 

By the grace of God by the time the morning rolls around, I started having doubts about drinking. There was something inside me that told me if I drink it would probably ruin my vacation because I would feel really guilty about breaking almost 6 months of abstinence. Despite this feeling, I decided to get to the airport 2 1/2 hours early in case I did want to drink I could have a good amount of time to do so. I decided I would just decide once I got to the airport. once I get to the airport it‚Äôs really cloudy which makes me even more nervous to fly so I start thinking. Maybe I will have a couple glasses of wine. 

And then once I got into the lounge, I sort of teeter taught her back-and-forth for a while about whether I should go to the bar, but you know what stopped me? There were barely any people at the bar there is maybe like five or six people drinking and the lounge was full. I realize that it‚Äôs really not normal to be drinking so early in the morning and that it‚Äôs not necessarily a desirable thing to do‚Ä¶ And I don‚Äôt know there was no clear aha moment but time just started trickling on and I just ended up passing the time, eating a bunch of food and drinking coffee Working on some things and before I knew it it was time to get on my plane and I hadnt drank.

Fast forward to a few days later when I have to leave for my flight back - the day my flight leaves on a redeye there‚Äôs news about the crash in India. I freak out. My flight anxiety shoots through the roof. 
I get to the airport longe this time it‚Äôs later in the evening so a ton of people are drinking at the lounge. I decide maybe I‚Äôll have one later. I never do I end up eating and drinking two teas. I get On my flight freaking out and picturing my plane colliding with another plane once I land in Newark. The plane takes off without incident‚Ä¶ But I‚Äôm still freaking out internally so I decide to buy a wine from the flight attendant just in case things get bad on the plane‚Ä¶ About an hour later we start encountering turbulence it‚Äôs not crazy turbulence but my fear pf flying combined with what I‚Äôve been seeing about air India, flying back into sketchy ass Newark  I‚Äôm literally trembling at every bump. I keep staring at the wine but I decide if this is it at this point one can of wine won‚Äôt help me. So I don‚Äôt drink it. I white knuckle the rest of the flight and we land without incident.

When I tell you, that was probably most trying time I‚Äôve had by far of braking my abstinence. and to be perfectly honest, I don‚Äôt think I want to get back on a plane unless I have Xanax because it was too much. But I‚Äôm really glad that I did not drink. I didn‚Äôt want this to be the beginning of another who knows how many months of binge drinking on and off. It was really hard but worth it. 



TDLR: I had every excuse to drink at the airport. Fear of flying, free alcohol, turbulence, flying into Newark airport but I didn‚Äôt and I‚Äôm so grateful.

It was amazing. Unfortunately, I am worried vanilla dating will not cut it anymore. Sugar dating has changed my life perspective. It brought a new level of confidence, love, and femininity. It‚Äôs quite strange that this is considered taboo when I feel it‚Äôs how it should be. I‚Äôm not exactly sure what did it but ultimately I think the more I poured into myself and let others(my SD) pour into me‚Ä¶the more my life just seemed to get better.

Definitely hang in there. It took me about two months to get to this point. About a month of meet and greets and a month to intimacy. I will say one cardinal rule for me is no matter how good the money is. I do not accept the arrangement until I like them as a person. (Usually figure this out after one coffee date, which I do not accept money for)

Also the treatment from a real SD is very obvious (they actually love the essence of what it is to be a woman) and you‚Äôll realize it is the real deal. Who knows, it might sour down the road but I take comfort knowing I‚Äôve changed for the better.

(please have your own money, you should be able to walk away if your gut is telling you No. Its a waste of time for you and the SD to fight against your instincts)

TLDR: I fucked it was amazing. Also found out I liked giving BJs, who knew I just needed money to unlock that. üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",1,1749870172.0,sugarlifestyleforum,0,1.0,False

(I will not promote),"Recently I came across the news that Omegle was shut down. And as someone who used it previously (not that I was a big fan of it) I started thinking why people would have used it. I recently moved abroad for higher education and as an introvert it has been difficult making friends that are local. As someone who prefers to text and someone working on keeping a conversation going, I realized I needed help with it. I would much rather talk to another real person than an AI chatbot. So I got thinking, maybe a one to one messaging app that connects you with a random person in the same city/ local area every week with the goal of getting to know each other and making friends. The app's primary audience is introverts that struggle to make or keep a conversation going just like me. And to help them the app would feature an AI assistant that would read the last few messages with the other person and suggests follow-ups for the user to type to keep the chat going. The app could also feature a ""third-place finder"" that helps the user find places to meet in-person. The recommendation is based on the messages. Example: if the user says ""would like to have a coffee together and talk more"" and if the other person agrees, a box on the chat window appears showing nearby coffee shops.

Hopefully the idea comes across well. What do you guys think? Is this a tarpit idea or a problem you have faced or know someone who faces it? This is not a promotion and I will not promote. ",1,1749870055.0,startups,1,1.0,False

1layevp,https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1layevp/diallingin_batch_brews_with_the_aiden_ode_gen_2/,Dialling-in batch brews with the Aiden + Ode Gen 2,"Hi all,

I‚Äôve had the Aiden since shortly after its initial release. Unlike many users, my experience with the hardware and software has been trouble-free.

However, I‚Äôve encountered difficulty with the dialling-in process. I‚Äôve been struggling to make a satisfactory cup of coffee.

Before the Aiden, we used a Moccamaster, and we genuinely loved that machine. I found dialling in relatively straightforward: adjust the grind size to ensure the brew time falls within a certain range, and it consistently produces solid results. 

We currently use a Fellow Ode Gen 2 for grinding

We‚Äôre considering moving back to the Moccamaster. Before making a decision, I wanted to reach out to the subreddit for advice. 

I‚Äôm generally a light-roast guy, local roaster kind of guy‚Ä¶ for anyone in the GTA, Subtext is my go-to for great quality beans.

For our morning brew, my wife and I like to make 4-5 cups-worth of coffee‚Ä¶ we did that with the Moccamaster and have continued to do so with the Aiden. 

Because of the volume of coffee we go through, we tend to buy less artisanal coffee from time-to-time to keep costs down, but still brew a lot of Subtext or other premium roasts through the Aiden. 

At the moment, we have a few bags of cheaper beans from Costco.. medium roast, non-oily  beans by Level Ground. One bag of Peruvian and one bag of Andes. 

I‚Äôm hoping for some recipe / grind setting suggestions to have one more kick at the can while we have these two massive bags of so-so beans to see if we can produce something for our morning batch brew that rivals what we could get with the Moccamaster. 

Any dialling-in tips about brew-time or drawdown for batch brews would also be greatly appreciated. I have no issues with spending time working out a technique‚Ä¶

Final thing to mention is that I almost never use the Aiden to produce a single cup‚Ä¶ I prefer my kettle and V60 for that‚Ä¶ and can make a cup just as fast, if not faster, than I can with the Aiden. 

Maybe that‚Äôs my problem? The Aiden just isn‚Äôt a best-in-class batch brewer?

1laycvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/auscorp/comments/1laycvb/guide_for_breaking_into_investment_banking/,Guide for Breaking into Investment Banking,"Hi all,

This post is intended to provide a thorough breakdown on the best pathways into Investment Banking for:

1. Undergraduate/Graduate students (Bachelor and masters students)
2. Working professionals within commerce ( Big4 accounting firms, Big4 banks, etc)

I have made a post below which summarises my experience in IBD (main duties, pros and cons) as well as a detailed comments section for questions.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/auscorp/comments/1l6wn51/the\_australian\_investment\_banking\_experience/](https://www.reddit.com/r/auscorp/comments/1l6wn51/the_australian_investment_banking_experience/)

\-----

**The 3 main areas of Investment banking are:**

1. Investment Banking Division (IBD) - M&A / Equity Capital Markets / Debt Capital Markets / Restructuring / Leveraged Finance
2. Equity Research
3. Institutional Sales & Trading

This post will be focused on IBD as this is my area of expertise. Equity Research is unique as there is a strong emphasis to hire Industry professionals (without finance backgrounds) in their field. E.g. hiring doctors as healthcare analysts, hiring engineers for technology analysts. Sell side equity research is also a dying industry and there are limited seats. Sales & Trading is also a niche and the market in Australia is small with very few seats.

\-----

**Australia's Investment Banking Landscape**

**1. International Big Dogs**¬†\- Goldman/JPM/UBS/MorganS/RBC/Citi/Barclays/BOFA/Jefferies

\- Nothing needs to be said here. Get worked like a dog but sets up your life.

2.¬†**International Elite Boutiques -**¬†Moelis Australia/ Lazard/ Houlihan/ Greenhill/ Rothschild, etc

\- weaker presence in Australia - strong brand name

3.¬†**Boutique Banks (Independent Strategic M&A Advisors)**¬†\- Flagstaff Partners/Grant Samuel/Gresham/Highbury Partnership/Canterbury Partners/ Luminis Partners/ Allier Capital/ Azure Capital/Record Point etc.

\- Mostly Sydney based, strong brand names, great experience, senior guys are usually ex rainmakers of international big dog banks.

**4\*\*. ANZ Big 3**¬†\-\*\* Macquarie / Barrenjoey/ Jarden

\- Rivals the big dogs - close to zero international presence (Macq has small infra presence globally, Barrenjoey strategic partnership with Barclays)

**5\*\*. Stockbrokers/wealth advisory firm**s\*\* - Canaccord Genuity/ Bell Potter/ Morgans/ E&P/ Ord Minnett /Wilsons

\- Plays in the small-mid cap space. No M&A capability - small equity capital market teams.

\-----

**Action items (in-order of importance)**

**1. Networking**

\- Reach out to Analyst/Associates via email/Linkedin to set up calls/coffee chats with the goal of learning more about what they do/their experiences on the job and the bank.

\- Helps to get interviews and extremely useful during interviews/superday if you can say "" after speaking with person x, some of the main takeaways are y and z.... as a result, i think this makes me a great fit cos of ........""

\- Puts your CV to the top of the list and is great to build rapport. Senior decision makers look to the analyst/associates when it comes to junior hiring (ft and internships)

**2. Interview Preparation**¬†( broken down into Technical/behavioural/real-life case studies)

A) Behavioural - Ensure strong answers for these below:

\- Why Investment banking?

\- Why this particular bank and group?

\- What are you strengths and weaknesses?

\- Where do you see yourself in 5-10 years?

\* Setting up calls with analysts at the bank to get their experiences is key here.

B) Technical

\- Run me through the 3 main valuation methodologies (DCF/Trading comps/ Transaction comps)

\- Pitch me a stock/talk about personal investing journey ( 100% asked if investing and stock picking is under hobbies)

\- Understanding how the 3 financial statements tie together

\- General corporate finance understanding

C) Case studies/ past transactions

\- Study the bank's past transactions and other landmark deals (Street talk - AFR)

**3. Financial modelling courses**

**-**¬†Wall Street Prep investment banking course helps build technical skills and most importantly, financial modelling understanding.

\- Good to talk to during interviews

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**1. Undergraduate/graduate students**

\- The degree is not overly important - Commerce/Business/Finance/Economics/Science/Maths/Law are all suitable.

\- Your number 1 goal is to secure a 8-10 week summer/winter analyst role (internship). International big dog banks DO NOT hire any graduates without such experience. Summer analyst roles are open at the moment - linkedin/company website - for boutique banks, send cold email via their contact on website. Network as much as you can.

\- internships at Big 4 accounting firms are also great (deal advisory/m&a/transaction services/ financial DD). Institutional/corporate banking, markets etc are excellent at big 4 banks.

At this stage, any internship is good as it helps set up the next thing - the 1st one is always the hardest to get. Follow action items 1-3. The goal is to do as much as you can, does not have to be from a tier 1 institution - say YES to every opportunity. Talk to as many industry professionals as you can.

Requirements

\- Go8 Uni, 75+ WAM minimum (top banks require 80+), strong co-curricular, leadership, previous relevant experience (this could be anything - just need to show you have tried to do something) and 95+ATAR (this absolutely matters - Can't really say I'm hard working, smart and eager to learn with shit ATAR).

\*I've seen alot of people comment in previous posts about requiring 85-90+ WAM to be competitive. This is simply untrue. Its about becoming a well-rounded candidate that can come across as a genuine person during the interviews. Investment banking is not about who can crunch the numbers the best - if i'm going to work 80+ hrs a week with someone, I better enjoy working with that person"". For reference, I've secured interviews at Goldman/MBB consulting /Macquarie/ top hedge funds with \~78ish WAM.

\---------

**1. Working Professionals within Commerce/Law**

Big 4 Accounting firms ( Deal advisory/ Transaction services/ M&A/ Financial DD) are gateways into IB. Very common for people to do 1.5-3 years and make the transition to IBD.

If you are in another area of the Big 4, seek a internal transfer within these areas ( Email the directors to set up coffee chats with the goal to learn more about what they do - Important to show interest but DO NOT ASK FOR A JOB).

Big 4 Banks (Corporate/Institutional Banking/Markets) are also gateways into IB. Same strategy as above....

Big Law also natural transitions into IB.

T**he key takeaway: the background is important, but its not the most important aspect. I am taking someone with a good background, great interview, genuine person who showed initiative via networking over the smartest/brightest person. Most decision makers share this view.**

\--------

**Certifications**

1. MBA - pretty useless for breaking into IB
2. Masters - Opens up a 2nd window for internship recruitment. Does not guarantee a job - would say its not cost effective. Do not recommend
3. CFA - Best option for aspiring equity research analysts. A top MD once told me a CFA 3 guarantees a job at any wall st bank - I tend to agree with this. Valuable for IB - best option IMO.

**Conclusion**

From a numbers perspective, the reality is most people will not break into IB straight out of Uni, however there many routes post graduation to get in.

Hopefully this helps someone :)

Micah tried to reassure me.‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,Riley.I still love you.Lana‚Äôs like family.And the kid‚Ä¶I just feel bad for him.Growing up without a dad can really mess a kid up.I just want to be there for him.Let‚Äôs put our wedding on hold.When he‚Äôs older,we‚Äôll explain everything.I promise I‚Äôll give you the big wedding you deserve.‚Äù

And just like that,the three of them walked off hand-in-hand to get their marriage certificate.

I pulled out my phone and called Asher Lane‚Äîthe guy who‚Äôs been chasing me for ten years.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm outside City Hall and in need of a marriage certificate.Want to be my husband?‚Äù

‚Äî‚Äî

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre asking me to marry you?You‚Äôre full of surprises,Miss Vaughn,‚Äùhe said,stunned.‚ÄúI literally just got off a flight.I‚Äôm out of the country right now.‚Äù

‚ÄúNever mind then.‚Äù

But before I could hang up,his tone shifted‚Äîsuddenly urgent.‚ÄúWait!Don‚Äôt move.I‚Äôll be back before the place closes.Whoever bails is a chicken!‚Äù

After hanging up,I let out a long breath.Guess I‚Äôd better find somewhere to wait.

That‚Äôs when I heard someone call out sharply,‚ÄúRiley Vaughn!‚Äù

I turned [around.It](http://around.It) was Micah.He must‚Äôve already gotten their license.He had the kid in one arm and was holding Lana‚Äôs hand with the other.Picture-perfect little family.

He came up to me,looking irritated.‚ÄúWhy are you still here?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm waiting for someone,‚ÄùI said honestly.‚ÄúTo get a marriage certificate with.‚Äù

He rolled his eyes.‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to be sarcastic.I already told you‚ÄîI only just found out about the kid.Don‚Äôt you understand?‚Äù

I nodded.‚ÄúI understand.‚Äù

Micah stepped closer and lowered his voice.‚ÄúThen please,just go home.I don‚Äôt want to cause a scene in front of the child.‚Äù

I brushed his hand off my arm.‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious.I‚Äôm actually waiting for someone‚Äîto get married.‚Äù

His face darkened.‚ÄúRiley,this is your last warning.Keep acting like this and I swear,I‚Äôll start to really hate you.‚Äù

Lana stepped forward with a sweet,concerned look on her face.‚ÄúAre you upset because you didn‚Äôt get your marriage certificate,Riley?‚Äùshe asked gently.

She pulled hers from her bag and held it out.‚ÄúHere.Take a photo with mine.The covers are all the same‚Äîno one will know it‚Äôs not yours unless they open it.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt take it.The booklet dropped to the ground.

Lana crouched down,her eyes glistening as she picked it up.Her voice trembling.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.I shouldn‚Äôt have come back with the child.‚Äù

Chapter 2

Micah shot me a glare and said coldly,‚ÄúRiley,I didn‚Äôt know you were this petty.If you can‚Äôt accept Lana,then we‚Äôre done!‚Äù

I said,‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

My calm response caught him off guard.

Lana quickly leaned down and nudged the boy toward me.‚ÄúGo on,sweetheart.Say hi to this lady and tell her not to be upset.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äùthe boy shouted.‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a bad woman!A homewrecker!‚Äù

Then,out of nowhere,he shoved me hard.‚ÄúYou steal my daddy!‚Äù

People started staring.Some even looked disgusted.I heard someone mutter,‚ÄúWow,side chicks are really bold these days‚Äîcoming to the courthouse to steal someone‚Äôs husband.‚Äù

I looked at the boy and said gently,‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry.Your dad and I broke up.He‚Äôs all yours now.I wish your parents a lifetime of happiness.‚Äù

Micah nodded in approval.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs more like it.Keep being sensible like this.‚Äù

Then he walked off with Lana and the boy,like the perfect little family.

As I watched his back,I thought,‚ÄòThat wasn‚Äôt me being‚Äòsensible.‚ÄôI meant every word.‚Äô

I found a nearby caf√©and sat down to wait for Asher.

While I was sipping my coffee,a news alert popped up on my phone.

‚ÄúBreaking News:Lane Group‚Äôs representation walks out mid-signing at international contract ceremony.‚Äù

My heart skipped a beat.

Lane Group‚Äôs representation?Could it be Asher?

I clicked the link and sure enough‚Äîa video popped up.

It showed a tall,handsome man walking away mid-meeting,phone to his ear.

It was indeed Asher.

I could even faintly hear him say,‚ÄúWhoever bails is a chicken.‚Äù

Then came a clip of a reporter interviewing the other party involved in the signing.‚ÄúMr.Lane left [midway.Do](http://midway.Do) you take that as a sign of disrespect?‚Äù

The man being interviewed,an older white gentleman,just shrugged and smiled.‚ÄúAll I can say is‚Äîlove comes first.I don‚Äôt feel disrespected at all.Actually,I admire Mr.Lane‚Äôs for [it.It](http://it.It) aligns perfectly with our values.We‚Äôll wait for him to come back.This won‚Äôt affect our partnership in any way.‚Äù

I put my phone down,feeling overwhelmed.

Asher Lane had chased me for ten years‚Äîalways putting me first,always loving me with everything he had.

But I was so caught up in Micah,I never gave him a real chance.

Now that I was done with Micah,I could finally see things clearly.

When I compared the two,it hit me‚ÄîAsher‚Äôs love was real.Micah‚Äôs was nothing but empty promises.

I opened my inbox and started reading through Asher‚Äôs old emails.

Every message was filled with warmth and sincerity.Back then I thought he was being clingy‚Ä¶now I realized they were love letters.

Letter after letter,full of love I never noticed.

My heart ached a [little.How](http://little.How) did he manage to keep loving me all those years?

I read them all and before I knew it,the sun was starting to set.

Then suddenly‚Äîa bouquet of flowers appeared in front of me.

I looked up and saw Asher,standing there with the biggest grin.

‚ÄúSorry I kept you waiting,wifey,‚Äùhe said.

That word caught me off [guard.It](http://guard.It) felt strange but‚Ä¶not weird.

Asher noticed my silence and looked a little nervous.‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôve changed your mind?‚Äù

I smiled at him.‚ÄúRelax.I‚Äôm not a chicken.‚Äù

We walked back into the courthouse,side by side and got our license.

I knew there were still people waiting for him across the ocean,so I encouraged him to head back soon.

Chapter 3

Asher pulled me into a tight hug.‚ÄúWhen I get back,we‚Äôll have the wedding.And just so you know‚Äîwhoever backs out is a chicken.‚Äù

I watched him walk away,unable to stop a bitter smile from curling at my lips.This was the great Asher Lane‚Äîconfident,commanding,practically royalty in the business world.And yet,so insecure when it came to love?

It was already getting dark when I finally made my way home,cradling the bouquet of flowers he gave me.

What I didn‚Äôt expect was the scene waiting for me on the other side of the door.

Lana.And her son.

She was lounging on my couch,in my pajamas,casually watching TV.Her son,shoes on and all,was bouncing like a maniac on the designer couch I‚Äôd painstakingly chosen‚Äîleaving muddy footprints all over the upholstery.That couch cost over ten grand.

I felt rage rising in my chest,boiling over‚Äîbut before I could say a word,Micah walked out of the kitchen.

His brows furrowed in confusion.‚ÄúWhy are you back?‚Äù

I choked on my anger for a moment before I forced out a cold reply,‚ÄúPretty sure this is still my place.‚Äù

The boy suddenly chucked his toy at me.‚ÄúThis is my dad‚Äôs house.It‚Äôs our house.Get out!‚Äù

I was stunned.Lana,completely unfazed,just smiled sweetly and said,‚ÄúOh Riley,don‚Äôt mind [him.Kids](http://him.Kids) don‚Äôt know any better.‚Äù

Then she walked over and,without asking,snatched the flowers from my hands.‚ÄúAre these for me and Micah?That‚Äôs so thoughtful of you.Thanks for the well wishes.‚Äù

I tried to take the bouquet back,but her son yanked it away.He threw it to the ground,stomped on it hard and spat,‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want your stupid flowers.Stop trying to suck up to my mom!‚Äù

I was so furious my head started to throb.‚ÄúYou better pay for that bouquet!‚Äù

Micah snapped,clearly annoyed.‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just a [kid.Gosh.How](http://kid.Gosh.How) can you stoop to his level?‚Äù

Then he did the unthinkable‚Äîhe handed me an apron.‚ÄúJust go cook dinner.Don‚Äôt provoke him.‚Äù

I let out a disbelieving laugh.‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,am I your servant,now?How dare you telling me to cook?‚Äù

‚ÄúCould you just stop being difficult?‚ÄùMicah scowled.‚ÄúEver since we left the City Hall,you‚Äôve been nothing but dramatic.‚Äù

He kept going,voice sharp.‚ÄúEverything was fine until you showed up and threw it all into chaos.I‚Äôm trying to help you here.Just cook something‚Äîas a gesture for Lana and her kid.‚Äù

I locked eyes with [him.My](http://him.My) voice was low and steady.‚ÄúYou really think I‚Äôm the one who ruined everything‚Äîthat I should apologize?‚Äù

His gaze wavered.

But then he sighed.‚ÄúLook,the kid‚Äôs innocent.You‚Äôre the adult here.Can‚Äôt you just take the high road for once?I know it‚Äôs uncomfortable,but I‚Äôll make it up to you,okay?‚Äù

Something inside me snapped.

‚ÄúWhy does it always have to be me who suffers?‚ÄùI asked softly.‚ÄúWas I not innocent too?‚Äù

His gaze wavered.

Before he could respond,the boy came out of nowhere with a dinner fork and jabbed it into my thigh.

‚ÄúGet out!You don‚Äôt belong here!‚Äùhe screamed.

I shoved him away,hard.‚ÄúThis house is mine.I paid for it.If anyone‚Äôs leaving,it‚Äôs you.‚Äù

He burst into tears and ran straight into Lana‚Äôs arms.

I had bought this house to start a life with Micah after we got married.But clearly,he‚Äôd forgotten that.Instead,he‚Äôd decided it would be just the perfect little love nest for him,another woman and her child.

Lana wiped at her fake tears,looking tragically heartbroken.‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.We shouldn‚Äôt have come.We should probably leave now.‚Äù

But Micah stepped in immediately,stopping her.He looked genuinely upset.

Then he turned to me,anger flaring in his eyes.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs already dark out.Where can she go with a kid at this hour?Can‚Äôt you show a little compassion?‚Äù

I let out a heavy sigh.‚ÄúFine.But they‚Äôre gone by morning‚Äîor I‚Äôm calling the cops.‚Äù

Micah‚Äôs jaw clenched.‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre really going to throw them out‚Ä¶then I‚Äôll leave too.‚Äù

Chapter 4

I let out a hollow laugh.‚ÄúPlease do.‚Äù

I opened the bedroom door,just wanting to crash and forget this nightmare.

But the moment I walked in,I stopped cold.

The bedsheets were crumpled.The blanket had been used.And under my pillow,there it was‚Äîwomen‚Äôs underwear.Not mine.

A wave of nausea hit me.

Lana had already slept in my bed?

I grabbed my essentials,didn‚Äôt even glance at the people in the living room and stormed out.

I slammed the door behind me.Hard.

I‚Äôd stay at a hotel tonight.That place felt dirty now.Tomorrow,I‚Äôd bring in a cleaning crew.Maybe even throw out the bed.

The day had drained every ounce of energy out of me.After washing up at the hotel,I collapsed on the bed‚Äîonly for my phone to buzz.

A friend request.

I accepted without thinking.

Then came the photos.

Every single one showed Micah and Lana,in my house,tangled up in each other on what was supposed to be our marital bed.

The last image came with a message.\[Smart women know when to quit.\]

I replied:\[And some are into leftovers.I‚Äôm more than happy to hand him over.\]

Then I turned off my phone and went to sleep.

When I woke,the sun was already up.I ate breakfast,then went back to my house to reclaim what was mine.But when I opened the front door,I froze again.

Balloons.Streamers.Posters on the walls.

Micah and Lana‚Äôs wedding photos,everywhere.

Strangers‚Äîpeople I didn‚Äôt recognize‚Äîwere lounging on my couch,raiding my fridge,drinking from my mugs.

My bookshelf had been ransacked.Files scattered everywhere.The antique ornaments I‚Äôd bought at auctions and the heirloom gifts from my parents‚Äîmanhandled and some already shattered.

I forced myself to stay calm and turned off their loud music.

They all turned to look at me,annoyed.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚ÄùI asked coldly.‚ÄúWhat are you doing in my house?‚Äù

They exchanged confused glances.‚ÄúYour house?You mean Lana‚Äôs house?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here for the wedding.Who the hell are you?‚Äùthe other added.

I almost choked on my own fury.‚ÄúMicah and Lana‚Ä¶are holding a wedding here?!‚Äù

Then someone pointed at me.‚ÄúI know her.Guys,she‚Äôs that mistress!‚Äù

Before I could say anything,someone flung a cup of milk tea in my face.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got some nerve showing up here.Trying to ruin the wedding,you homewrecker?‚Äù

More people joined in‚Äîslapping,kicking,screaming at me.

I fought back,but there were too many.

I was shoved to the ground.

They got braver,crueler.

Someone hit me.Someone tried to rip my clothes.Others livestreamed the whole thing,wanting the whole internet to‚Äúsee what a mistress looks like.‚Äù

I covered my face,but they grabbed my hands and yanked them away.

They pinned my limbs down and hung a pair of heels around my neck.Then they spat in my face,mocking me,calling me cheap,shameless and other names.

I sobbed,helpless and humiliated,as they used my pain for entertainment.

Until suddenly‚Äîsomeone shouted,‚ÄúThe groom‚Äôs here!‚Äù

They backed off and rushed to the door.

I scrambled to my feet,barely able to stand.

And there they were‚ÄîMicah in a sharp suit,Lana in a wedding gown.

Micah saw me,disheveled and broken.He hesitated,then walked over.

Leaning in,he whispered,‚ÄúI thought you left.This is not a real wedding.We‚Äôre just putting on a show‚Ä¶for the kid.‚Äù

Chapter 5

My voice was cold.‚ÄúOh,I [see.So](http://see.So) the bruises on my face and the shattered antiques‚Äîthose are all just props for your little show?‚Äù

Micah frowned,clearly not happy with my reaction.

Before he could say anything,their friends swarmed around us.

‚ÄúMicah,this mistress has some nerve showing up here like this,‚Äùone of them sneered.‚ÄúYou should slap her‚Äîmake it up to Lana.‚Äù

Micah didn‚Äôt move.

But Lana was staring at him expectantly.

Micah turned to me instead.‚ÄúJust leave,okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy should I?‚ÄùI asked coldly.‚ÄúAnd mistress?Tell me,Micah‚Äîam I a mistress?‚Äù

Someone nearby scoffed and spat at the ground near my feet.‚ÄúMicah has a wife and kid.What else would that make you?‚Äù

I stared at Micah with fire in my eyes.‚ÄúWell?‚Äù

Micah‚Äôs voice was low.‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Gasps rippled through the crowd.Chaos erupted as everyone started shouting in Lana‚Äôs defense.

Micah tried to calm them down.‚ÄúNo,it‚Äôs not what you think,guys.She and I‚Ä¶we‚Äôre just friends.She‚Äôs not a mistress.We barely even know each other.‚Äù

I let out a disbelieving laugh.‚ÄúNot even friends?Really,Micah?Then tell me‚Äîwhy are you holding your wedding in my house?‚Äù

Someone near me kicked my leg.‚ÄúYour house?This is Micah and Lana‚Äôs home,you delusional gold digger.‚Äù

‚ÄúTypical homewrecker.‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople like her should be paraded through the streets.‚Äù

They hurled insults like it was a sport.

I pulled out my phone and started dialing the police.

But Micah lunged forward,yanked it from my hand and hung up.

‚ÄúRiley,‚Äùhe said in a low voice.‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶let today happen,okay?After this,you can do whatever the hell you want‚Äù

I opened my mouth to argue‚Äîbut then a voice I recognized cut in.

‚ÄúJust listen,Riley.Don‚Äôt make a [scene.It](http://scene.It) won‚Äôt help you.‚Äù

I turned around and froze.

It was Micah‚Äôs mother.

She used to treat me like her own daughter‚Äîalways warm,always kind.She once told Micah that if he ever dared mistreat me,she‚Äôd be the first to object.

Yet here she was,attending his wedding‚Ä¶to another woman.

She dragged me into the bathroom,locked the door and said,‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,honey.I‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre treated fairly.Micah didn‚Äôt even know you when Lana got pregnant.Technically,it‚Äôs not cheating.Let them get married.Then they can get divorced.Better to be with a divorced dad than a man with an illegitimate child,right?‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh.‚ÄúDo you think I still want to be with Micah?Mrs.Langston,he‚Äôs free to marry whoever he wants‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt care less.But this is my house.I‚Äôm only asking him to leave.And of course,he‚Äôll be paying for all the damage done here today.‚Äù

Micah‚Äôs mom froze.

She stared at me like she didn‚Äôt recognize me anymore.‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶don‚Äôt you love Micah?‚Äùshe asked,still in disbelief.‚ÄúYou were willing to do anything for him.I remember you standing outside my door for three hours after he broke up with you.‚Äù

Chapter 6

‚ÄúRiley,Micah only married Lana to give her status.It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôll really be together.Why are you blowing this out of proportion?‚Äùshe sounded impatient.

Hearing her dig up the past twisted something deep inside me.

Hearing her bring up the past made something twist in my chest.

God,I‚Äôd been so blind.

I was the one with money,the one from a good family‚Äîand yet I bent over backwards for Micah,terrified of upsetting him.I gave everything and asked for nothing.

Micah had me all figured out.The more I gave,the more he took.

He made me feel small,worthless‚Äîalways threatening to leave me if I didn‚Äôt play by his rules.And stupid me,I played right into his hands.I clung to him harder.

That‚Äôs probably why he had the nerve to marry Lana right under my nose.

He must‚Äôve thought I was fully‚Äòtamed.‚Äô

I‚Äôd never been in love before [him.So](http://him.So) I thought loving someone meant putting their happiness above everything.

But what I never realized‚Äîuntil now‚Äîis that real love isn‚Äôt about losing yourself.It‚Äôs about being happy,too.

With that thought,I turned to Micah‚Äôs mom and smiled politely.‚ÄúThat was then.This is now.And if I don‚Äôt get a satisfaction answers,I‚Äôm calling the cops on everyone.‚Äù

I opened the door and stepped out.

Behind me,Micah‚Äôs mom snapped,‚ÄúRiley,you better think this through.Everyone here saw you playing the homewrecker today.Whether it‚Äôs true or not,your reputation‚Äôs shot.And when that happens,we won‚Äôt agree to it even if you fall to your knees and cry blood begging to get back together and marry Micah.‚Äù

I spun around and shot back,‚ÄúOh,don‚Äôt worry about that.I‚Äôm already married.‚Äù

I bent down to pick up my phone from the ground,ready to call the cops.

But Micah grabbed my wrist.

He looked at me coldly and said,‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really determined to ruin my wedding with Lana,aren‚Äôt you?Fine then.I won‚Äôt protect you anymore.‚Äù

He shoved me hard and I fell to the ground.Then he turned to the onlookers and said loudly,‚ÄúDrag her into the guest room.Don‚Äôt let her cause any more trouble.‚Äù

In an instant,seven or eight men surrounded me.Their faces lit up with excitement as they dragged me toward the guest room.

We hadn‚Äôt even made it inside when their hands started wandering.If they managed to get me through that door,I knew exactly what would happen.

I fought back with everything I had,but I was no match for them.

And then the front door slammed open.

A man‚Äôs furious voice echoed through the room.‚ÄúTouch my wife and you‚Äôre dead!‚Äù

Tears immediately streamed down my face.

Asher had arrived.

Chapter 1

The first time my billionaire husband was drugged,I rushed over in a panic,only to run into a trembling female university student.

Before I could say a word,the man immediately dropped to his knees in front of me,pleading bitterly.

‚ÄúLiora,it was my fault,I wronged you.The drug was just too strong,I couldn‚Äôt help myself,that‚Äôs the only reason I‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI swear it was just this once.I‚Äôll never do it again.Please,don‚Äôt divorce me!‚Äù

After ten years of being in love,I believed him.

Two months later,my husband was drugged again.This time,I was right next [door.As](http://door.As) I walked over,I heard one of his companions teasing:

""Tavian,every time you come here,you take an pill.Aren‚Äôt you afraid you‚Äôll drop dead one day?""

The man's voice was hoarse.""I'm not afraid.Even if I die on her,it's worth it.""

With that,he leaned over the woman beside him.

I felt as if I had been struck by lightning,instinctively clutching the prenatal checkup report in my bag.

So,this so-called drug effect was just a lie to cover up his cheating.

If that's the case,then I might as well abort the child I finally conceived after five long years‚Ä¶

Without hesitation,I pulled out my phone and scheduled an miscarriage.

The next second,the phone rang.The caller sounded drunk,with a hint of a coquettish tone.

""How about you divorce him and marry me?""

""Okay.""

‚Äî‚Äî

The person on the other end of the line fell silent,stunned.After a long pause,he finally spoke,""Really?""

Listening to the sounds of groaning coming from the private room,I nodded.""Really.If I'm lying,I'm done!""

After the call ended,I drove back to the seaside apartment Tavian had specially designed for me.I couldn't help but recall our past.

We had been together for ten years,married for seven.I had stood by Tavian through everything,from having nothing to becoming someone admired by all.

On countless nights,he would breathe heavily by my ear,gripping my hand tightly.""Liora,I swear I‚Äôll never let you down for the rest of my life.""

And I believed him.

I thought we would be different from others,but in the end,we still couldn‚Äôt escape the seven-year itch.

A sudden pain pierced my heart and tears welled up in my eyes,spilling over uncontrollably.

Tavian,in the end,you still betrayed me.

After a long while,I got up and went to the study.I printed a copy of the divorce [agreement.One](http://agreement.One) stroke at a time,I signed my name.

Just as the pen left the paper,Tavian called.

‚ÄúLiora,hurry and drive to Green Hospital.Melia‚Ä¶suddenly started bleeding a lot down there‚Ä¶‚Äù

Tavian had always been calm and¬†[composed.In](http://composed.in/)¬†the seven years of our marriage,even when I drank myself into gastric bleeding to help his career,he had never once lost control like this.

Driven by a doctor‚Äôs instinct,I rushed to the hospital.

When I arrived at the emergency room,I saw Tavian cradling a young woman in his arms,whispering soothing words.‚ÄúDon't be scared.I won‚Äôt let anything happen to you.‚Äù

The moment he saw me,he shouted desperately,‚ÄúLiora,please save her!I‚Äôm begging you,save her!‚Äù

Swallowing the bitter ache in my chest,I pulled over a surgical stretcher and motioned for him to lay her down.

On the way to the operating room,Melia leaned weakly against Tavian,looking as if she could collapse at any moment.

""Tavian‚Ä¶am I going to die?I'm only 22‚Ä¶I haven't even gotten married yet...""

Tavian‚Äôs face was full of distress.‚ÄúNonsense,of course you won‚Äôt!We still have so much ahead of us!‚Äù

But the young girl was still unwilling to give up.‚ÄúThen‚Ä¶can you say you love me?I‚Äôm afraid I won‚Äôt be able to hold on‚Ä¶‚Äù

Tavian hesitated for a few seconds.Before I could turn my head,I heard his deep voice.

Chapter 2

‚ÄúMelia,I love you!I‚Äôve loved you for a long time!If it weren‚Äôt for that damned marriage certificate,I‚Äôd marry you this instant!‚Äù

In that moment,it felt as if my heart had been torn into pieces and every breath came with searing pain...

Tavian‚Äôs passionate vows only came to an end when we reached the doors of the operating room.

During the examination,because it was under local anesthesia,Melia remained conscious the entire time.

From the moment she was wheeled in,her once pitiful expression shifted into one of provocation.

‚ÄúLiora,do you know why I was bleeding?It‚Äôs because Tavian was too rough.He pressed me up against the sink and that‚Äôs what caused it.‚Äù

I ignored her,but Melia was relentless,continuing to describe all kinds of intimate details about her and Tavian‚Äôs bedroom affairs.

When the ultrasound probe revealed she was pregnant,my hand suddenly trembled.

Just then,the assistant walked in.Forcing myself to stay calm,I asked her to finish the suturing procedure and stepped out to wash my face.

The moment I opened the door,Tavian rushed over frantically.

‚ÄúLiora,how is she?Is she okay?‚Äù

I kept my expression blank.

‚ÄúEarly pregnancy.The bleeding was caused by intense physical activity.She‚Äôll need to stay overnight for observation.If there are no issues,she can be discharged tomorrow.‚Äù

Tavian stood there stunned,unable to suppress the smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.

After a long pause,he finally noticed me,then dropped to his knees with a thud.

‚ÄúLiora‚Ä¶I took her virginity and now she‚Äôs pregnant.I‚Äôm begging you,please let me keep this baby.Let me take responsibility for her‚Ä¶just this once!‚Äù

""I promise,everything between us will stay the same.And since you can‚Äôt get pregnant anyway,once the baby is born,I‚Äôll bring it back for you to raise!""

My eyes instantly welled up.I lowered my gaze,not wanting him to see.

""Okay.""

Tavian,I would give you my blessing and let you took full responsibility.

The next morning,I was woken by the noise of large bags being carried downstairs.

As I stepped down,I saw Tavian walking in with Melia in his arms,his hands full of this season‚Äôs latest luxury items.

When he saw me,a flicker of panic flashed across his eyes.He quickly tried to explain,""Liora,the hospital was too crowded,not ideal for her recovery.I thought the sea breeze and scenery might lift her mood,so I brought her back.""

""Can she stay here for a while?Just until the baby‚Äôs born‚Ä¶Then I‚Äôll have her move out.""

Before I could say a word,Melia walked over with a face full of sincerity

‚ÄúLiora,thank you so much for yesterday.If it weren‚Äôt for you,Tavian and I might have lost our baby.‚Äù

Then she stepped closer,leaning in to whisper so only the two of us could hear:

‚ÄúLiora,I truly pity you.First,I got pregnant with your husband‚Äôs child.Then he brought me back to your home.Tell me,what‚Äôs next?Should I take your place and become Mrs.Mercer?‚Äù

Her face was full of smug provocation,but I simply smiled calmly.‚ÄúSure.You can have the title of Mrs.Mercer.‚Äù

Melia,however,suddenly grabbed my arm,her eyes turning red with emotion.

‚ÄúLiora,you‚Ä¶you‚Äôve misunderstood me.I‚Äôm not trying to take your place and I never wanted to steal Tavian for myself‚Ä¶‚Äù

With that,she dropped to her knees,despite her leg still being wrapped in gauze.

‚ÄúLiora,I was [wrong.It](http://wrong.It) was all my fault.I shouldn‚Äôt have volunteered to be Mr.Mercer‚Äôs cure‚Ä¶and I never should‚Äôve gotten pregnant with his baby!‚Äù

""But I really never meant to ruin your marriage with Tavian.I just‚Ä¶I truly want to give birth to this child.Please don‚Äôt worry‚Ä¶once the baby is born,I‚Äôll leave far,far away.I promise I won‚Äôt ever be an eyesore to you again!""

Chapter 3

Tears instantly welled up in Melia‚Äôs eyes,as if she had just suffered the greatest grievance in the world.

Tavian immediately pulled her into his arms from behind,then turned to look at me with a coldness I had never seen before.

‚ÄúLiora,what‚Äôs the meaning of this?Didn‚Äôt you promise me you‚Äôd let her keep the baby?If you have any issues,take them out on me.Why are you making things hard for a young girl like her?‚Äù

Melia,pale-faced,curled up weakly in his arms and whispered,‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not her fault.It‚Äôs me.I‚Äôve wronged her.I‚Ä¶I‚Äôll go to the hospital now and have the baby aborted!I swear I won‚Äôt bother you two ever again!‚Äù

As she spoke,she tried to get up and leave,but Tavian frantically pulled her back into his arms.

‚ÄúNo,Melia,you did nothing wrong.‚Äù

Then he turned to me with a cold,cutting gaze.‚ÄúLiora,apologize.‚Äù

I let out a short,mocking laugh.‚ÄúAnd why should I?‚Äù

Tavian‚Äôs eyes were bloodshot.‚ÄúBecause you made things difficult for her!‚Äù

Seeing the situation escalate,Melia quickly grabbed my hand,her voice trembling.‚ÄúLiora,please don‚Äôt be upset with Mr.Mercer.He only said that because he was [worried.How](http://worried.How) could I possibly let you apologize to me?It‚Äôs all my fault.‚Äù

I suddenly flung her hand away.‚ÄúHave you finished your little act?‚Äù

The words had barely left my mouth when Tavian,seething with rage,shoved me hard from behind.

My lower abdomen slammed into the sharp corner of the coffee table,sending a wave of pain that left me drenched in cold sweat.

‚ÄúLiora,you‚Äôre truly beyond [redemption.You](http://redemption.You) dare lay a hand on her in front of me?I‚Äôll say it one last time,apologize to her!‚Äù

I stared him straight in the eyes and enunciated each word clearly.‚ÄúNot a chance.I will never apologize to her!‚Äù

Tavian‚Äôs gaze darkened instantly.He grabbed a fistful of my hair and dragged me into the kitchen.

Then he ordered the bodyguards to bring in a large basket full of mangoes.

‚ÄúIf you still refuse to repent‚Ä¶then you‚Äôd better learn what that costs.‚Äù

I looked up in disbelief and screamed,""Tavian,are you insane?Did you forget that I'm allergic to mangoes?Are you trying to kill me?""

His voice was ice-cold.""I know.But since you hurt Melia,you need to pay the price.""

With that,he forcefully shoved a mango into my mouth,with its skin still on.I shook my head desperately,but several bodyguards,following orders,pinned down my shoulders tightly.

Chunks of mango flesh kept entering my¬†[throat.My](http://throat.my/)¬†whole body started itching and my breathing became labored.

In a daze,I recalled how,shortly after we got married,I accidentally ate a bite of mango-filled cake.Tavian had rushed me to the hospital,eyes red with panic and stayed by my side for three whole days and nights.

Since then,every servant in the house knew one unshakable rule that mangoes were strictly forbidden in our home.

But now,everything had changed...

Gradually,I couldn‚Äôt breathe anymore.Just before I lost consciousness,I heard Tavian‚Äôs cold,emotionless voice.""Force every last piece of mango into her.Don‚Äôt leave a single bite behind!""

When I opened my eyes again,Tavian was gently wiping the tears that had fallen in my sleep.

For a fleeting moment,I felt like nothing had changed.

But then,his next words brought me crashing back to reality.

‚ÄúDo you admit you were wrong,Liora?Why are you always so stubborn!‚Äù

Yes...this wasn‚Äôt the first time I had been stubborn.

Back then,when my parents opposed my marriage to Tavian,I cut ties with them just to secure a piece of paper,that was our marriage certificate.

The last words my mother said to me before she passed were:

‚ÄúLiora,one day,you‚Äôll regret this.‚Äù

Chapter 4

Now,everything had come true.

I lifted my head and looked straight into Tavian‚Äôs eyes.""Let‚Äôs get a divorce.""

He stared at me in disbelief:

""What kind of joke is this?You want to divorce me?Just because of Melia?I already told you that she‚Äôs pregnant and since you can‚Äôt have children anyway,this works out perfectly!""

I let out a bitter laugh,my fingertips instinctively resting on my lower abdomen.

""This is the divorce agreement.Take a look.""

Tavian‚Äôs expression suddenly turned cold.""Liora,are you throwing a tantrum?I‚Äôve already explained everything.Nothing will change.And now we even have a [child.How](http://child.How) is that not a good thing?""

I shook my head and handed him the divorce papers.

""It‚Äôs not good.Tavian,I find you disgusting.‚Äù

His temper flared instantly.‚ÄúDisgusting?Liora,do you even know how many women are waiting for me to dat with them?Why can‚Äôt you just be more generous!‚Äù

With that,he tore the divorce agreement into pieces.‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you,I won‚Äôt agree to the divorce.Absolutely not!Look at yourself,you're already thirty and I‚Äôve had my way with you so many times,who else would want you besides me?‚Äù

After tearing the papers into shreds,he slammed the door and left.

I sent the electronic version of the agreement to my lawyer to handle,then packed my mother‚Äôs last belongings into my bag,preparing to leave.

Just as I reached the front door,a few men covered my mouth and dragged me into an alley.

Before I could ask who they were,Melia emerged from the crowd,her eyes full of blatant malice.

‚ÄúLiora,I didn‚Äôt want to touch you at first,but you had to go and get pregnant without any shame!Tell me,how could I possibly let the beast in your womb threaten my child?‚Äù

I forced down my fear and said,‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,I‚Äôve already scheduled an [miscarriage.No](http://miscarriage.No) one will compete with you.‚Äù

Melia sneered,""I prefer to trust my own eyes.""

Then,with a flick of her finger,several burly men pinned me down and tore my clothes apart viciously.

""Ah,help!Please spare me!I‚Äôll give you anything!I‚Äôm pregnant‚Ä¶please don‚Äôt hit my belly,help!""

At that moment,Tavian rushed over and the men vanished without a trace.

He shoved me away harshly and hurriedly caught Melia,who had collapsed to the ground.

Her eyes were red from crying.""Liora,I know you‚Äôre angry at me,but the child is [innocent.How](http://innocent.How) could you send people to beat me and specifically target my stomach?""

Tavian was burning with rage;his gaze seemed laced with venom.

Before I could say anything,he slapped me hard across the face.

He used all his strength and I fell straight to the ground.

Suddenly,I laughed.I laughed until tears fell.

Tavian didn‚Äôt even ask a single question.Without hesitation,he sentenced me to death.

Ten years of love couldn't compare to someone else's performance...

Then he scooped Melia into his arms and ordered the two bodyguards behind him,""Make her go through everything Melia just suffered,especially her abdomen!""

I was in disbelief and shook my head desperately.""Tavian,I haven't done anything [wrong.You](http://wrong.You) can't treat me like this!""

He ignored me completely and simply said to the bodyguards,""Do it.""

Fierce fists pounded into my body,into my abdomen,while Tavian stood above me,looking down without a trace of mercy in his eyes.

Not long after,a sharp pain surged in my lower belly and I felt a continuous flow of liquid beneath me.

As a gynecologist,I was painfully aware that...

Chapter 5

The baby couldn‚Äôt be saved.

Along with that,the last shred of hope I had for this relationship vanished too.

But the fists didn‚Äôt stop.I was in so much pain that my vision darkened and I begged in broken whispers,‚ÄúTavian...my stomach hurts...please stop...‚Äù

He gave me a cold look,his voice utterly indifferent.‚ÄúStill pretending?Anyone who doesn't know might think you‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs pregnant!‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt until my white dress was stained red with blood that Tavian realized something was wrong.He then ordered the bodyguards to take me to the hospital.

Before losing consciousness,my colleagues anxiously watched my body bleed profusely.I mustered my last bit of strength to say,‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell anyone I‚Äôm pregnant.‚Äù

After that,I closed my eyes with a sense of relief.

When I woke up again,I realized I had been unconscious for two whole days.Luckily,my colleagues had stayed by my side the entire time.But Tavian hadn‚Äôt appeared even once.

I looked everywhere and noticed my phone and my mother‚Äôs belongings were missing.Thinking they might be at home,I hurried to take a taxi back.

When I pushed open the door,I saw Melia sitting on Tavian‚Äôs lap wearing lingerie,casually playing with him.

When she saw me,she gasped and quickly grabbed a bathrobe to cover herself.

Tavian suddenly stopped,looking at me with displeasure.‚ÄúHow come you‚Äôre back?‚Äù

I kept a blank expression.‚ÄúJust here to get something,I‚Äôll leave soon‚Ä¶‚Äù

Before I could finish,out of the corner of my eye,I caught sight of the necklace on Melia‚Äôs¬†[neck.My](http://neck.my/)¬†breath hitched sharply.

That was the only keepsake my mother left me.

Five years ago,she had an accident at sea and her body was never found.The only thing she left behind were these 18 crystal pearls.

Tavian,worried I would be too devastated,had gone all the way to Pendarra Mountain to perform a ritual to bless these pearls,then strung them into a necklace as a keepsake for me.

And now,he had let another woman wear it,one dressed in lingerie.

Sensing the resentment in my eyes,Melia looked smug and said,‚ÄúLiora,Tavian said this necklace shines so [brightly.It](http://brightly.It) suits my fair skin perfectly.What do you think?‚Äù

I quickly walked up to her,trembling as I said,‚ÄúGive it back to me!‚Äù

But Melia held tightly onto the necklace around her neck.‚ÄúLiora,do you hate me that much?You just have to snatch the gift Tavian gave me away?‚Äù

Seeing she wouldn‚Äôt let go,I moved forward to grab it,but before I could even touch it,Tavian kicked me hard in the stomach.

‚ÄúLiora,are you fucking crazy or what?It‚Äôs just a lousy necklace!And you actually fought with her over it!‚Äù

The wound that had been stitched up was now being torn open violently,but I didn‚Äôt care about the pain.I just wanted desperately to get the necklace back.

But Tavian didn‚Äôt give me any chance at all.He directly yanked the necklace off and,facing the bottomless sea outside the window,my pupils constricted as I begged desperately,‚ÄúPlease,don‚Äôt!‚Äù

The next moment,the necklace slipped right from his hand and vanished into the endless ocean.‚ÄúNow let‚Äôs see how you‚Äôre going to get it back!‚Äù

After saying that,Tavian pulled Melia into the bedroom,where groans immediately began to echo.

I leapt off the balcony and the seawater quickly swallowed my breath.Just as I thought I could soon find my mother,a force behind me grabbed me with all its might,pulling me back up.

‚ÄúLiora,you aren‚Äôt allowed to die on me!You still haven‚Äôt taken responsibility for [me.You](http://me.You) said if you lie,you'll be done.Please,don‚Äôt leave me!‚Äù

Later,big drops of tears burned my skin.

‚ÄúLiora,you can‚Äôt break your [promise.You](http://promise.You) can‚Äôt leave me alone,or else I won‚Äôt let you rest even as a ghost!‚Äù

Pressed hard against my chest,I suddenly spat out the seawater from my nose,gasping for breath and said,‚ÄúDanny,take me away.‚Äù

Two days later,Tavian got off Melia‚Äôs bed.He shouted my name loudly throughout the villa,but no one answered.

Just as he was feeling puzzled,the property manager hurried in,‚ÄúMr.Mercer,there‚Äôs bad news.The body of a woman was found by the shore.It‚Äôs your wife!‚Äù

In my family,there's a tradition we have to follow.

The next heir must have a child with the strongest and most attractive man available.

Sounds noble,maybe even romantic,but it's more like The Bachelor meets a corporate blood pact.

In my last life,I pulled Desmond Caldwell‚Äôs name from the heirloom box of selection tokens.

The six-foot-two golden boy of the Caldwell dynasty.

Heir to a billion-dollar empire,all angles and cheekbones,with a jawline that made socialites swoon and an ego that could sink nations.

He once filled an entire garden with roses just for me.Whispered lines as if he‚Äôd swallowed a romance novel made me believe in the fantasy‚Äîwhite picket fences,candlelit dinners,forever.

I believed him.I let myself believe it.

And then,five months into my pregnancy,Desmond locked me in a cage.

A literal cage.Dog-sized.Steel bars.Cold cement.

He stood just beyond it,looking me straight in the eye,while he dat with another woman.

‚ÄúYou know what happened the day you pulled my name?‚Äùhe said,his voice sickly calm.‚ÄúGwen miscarried.She bled out.Her parents died in a car [crash.You](http://crash.You) owe her this.‚Äù

By the third day,my family had gone [bankrupt.My](http://bankrupt.My) father was dead from a fall no one could explain.

By the fifth,he‚Äôd sent ninety-nine of his private bodyguards to‚Äútake turns‚Äùwith me.

By the seventh,I miscarried.

By the ninth,I died.

And right before everything went dark,I heard his voice,soft,almost tender,like we hadn‚Äôt just destroyed each other.

Holding Gwen Bentley in his arms,he told her,‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry.Cassandra's family‚Äôs hundred-billion-dollar fortune is all yours now.‚Äù

But this time around?

I pulled a different name.

The one nobody wanted:Terrence D‚ÄôAngelo.

People called him the Madman of Metropolis.

Crippled.Disfigured.

Rumor was,he‚Äôd burned his own mother alive.People crossed the street when they saw him coming.

Later on,once untouchable,Desmond Caldwell would kneel in front of that same dog cage,where I was humiliated.

Blood on his face.

Nails broken.

Banging his head into the concrete like a man begging for a past he couldn‚Äôt undo.

And this time,it is my rise and my revenge.

‚Äî‚Äî

It all began at a long,gleaming table,solid mahogany,daunting in its perfection,the kind of table where futures are signed and lives are sold.

Twelve men in dark suits sat around it,grave and motionless.

Titans of industry.Kingmakers.

My father sat at the head,wearing that polished smile he used when cameras were on.

‚ÄúCassie,‚Äùhe said,like this was just another item on today‚Äôs agenda.‚ÄúPick one.These men have waited long enough to see you settled.‚Äù

On the table lay a bundle of selection tokens‚Äîeach carved with the names of powerful families'sons.Prestige etched in lacquered wood.

But one token looked [different.Faded.Weathered.Like](http://different.Faded.Weathered.Like) no one had touched it in years.

My eyes landed on it immediately.

Terrence D‚ÄôAngelo.

The name you weren‚Äôt supposed to say in polite company.

The one that made people lean in and whisper,'Poor thing,'before changing the subject.

They said he was ruined.Broken.Walked with a limp and a mangled leg.The D‚ÄôAngelos didn‚Äôt even bother to show up,and they sent some half-relative to pull the token for him.

But I remembered.

I remembered bleeding in that cage,humiliated,stripped of everything in my past life.The people who used to suck up to me were snapping pictures and laughing like it was a show.

Only one person knelt beside me.

Terrence D'Angelo.

And even as I was fading,he pulled out a handkerchief and gently wiped the blood from my face.

That was all it took.

I reached out and,without a second thought,selected his family token.

The room went dead silent.

My father‚Äôs face froze,like he couldn‚Äôt quite believe what he saw.

‚ÄúCassandra,‚Äùhe said,voice low,like I‚Äôd just announced I was marrying a corpse.‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI want him,‚ÄùI replied firmly.

He stared at me for a long,heavy beat,then leaned back and let out a slow,tired sigh.

‚ÄúFine.But if he ever lays a hand on you‚Äî‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt finish.He didn‚Äôt have to.Everyone in the room felt the weight behind the warning.

...

As I exited that suffocating room,I ran right into Desmond.

And Gwen.

Her eyes were red and watery.Her shoulders trembled like the whole world had come crashing down on her delicate little frame.

‚ÄúMs.Mercier,‚Äùshe said,her voice shaky,‚ÄúI know you hate me.But that studio...it meant everything to me.Why‚Äôd you destroy it?‚Äù

Before I could even breathe,Desmond stepped in front of her,as if shielding some precious treasure.

‚ÄúCassandra,‚Äùhe snapped.‚ÄúYou really stooped this low just to force me to marry you?‚Äù

I looked at both of them,my voice flat.‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do anything.‚Äù

I turned to leave,but Desmond grabbed my wrist tightly.

‚ÄúApologize.Pay for the damages.Or forget ever setting foot in the Caldwell estate again.‚Äù

Gwen yanked at his arm.‚ÄúDesmond,don‚Äôt!Cassie,it‚Äôs all my fault.""

Turning to me,she said,tears welling in her eyes,""I‚Äôll kneel if I have to.Just please...give me back the studio.‚Äù

Desmond‚Äôs anger only grew at her words.‚ÄúApologize to Gwen.She‚Äôs not in good health.Hand over that wellness center you own‚Äîshe needs it.‚Äù

And he kept going.‚ÄúGive her twenty of your best staff.Please make sure they‚Äôre professionals,the best ones.And a private medical team on standby 24/7.‚Äù

Chapter 2

I suddenly yanked my hand out of Desmond‚Äôs grip and let out a sharp,loud laugh.‚ÄúGod,[Desmond.Do](http://Desmond.Do) you really think that highly of yourself?‚Äù

I looked him square in the eyes,not blinking.‚ÄúThe name I picked...wasn‚Äôt yours.‚Äù

For a split second,something flickered in Gwen‚Äôs eyes‚Äîthere and gone before she masked it with a wide-eyed blink.

‚ÄúWhat did you just say?‚ÄùDesmond‚Äôs pupils narrowed.But he quickly twisted his expression into a smug sneer.‚ÄúGive it a rest.You‚Äôre jealous I treat Gwen the way you always wanted me to.That‚Äôs what this is.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt bother replying.I turned my back on him and walked out.

It felt [good.Clean.Like](http://good.Clean.Like) shutting a door and finally locking it for good.

For the first time,I had picked someone else.Someone who wasn‚Äôt Desmond Caldwell.Just thinking about it sent a slow,sweet satisfaction burning through my chest.

...

The next day,I headed to Gallery71‚Äîmy gallery.I wanted to find something to give Terrence,something personal.

A painting for our first meeting.Something symbolic.

But the moment I stepped inside,I stopped cold.

The walls were lined with portraits of Gwen.

Gwen lowered her head,seeming both modest and fragile.Her cheeks glistened with tears,and she shook slightly.

Turning back,she offered a timid smile.

Each painting was meticulously framed and illuminated by soft light,reminiscent of sacred artifacts.

‚ÄúDo you like them?‚ÄùDesmond‚Äôs voice drifted across the room.Smooth,warm,like it hadn‚Äôt once been used to damn me.

He stood beside her,gently brushing a hand down Gwen‚Äôs cheek.

‚ÄúEvery year on your birthday,‚Äùhe said,‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you the most special gift.‚Äù

Gwen flushed,voice syrupy.‚ÄúDesmond,you spoil me.‚Äù

Then she stood on her toes and kissed him.Just a little peck.

But not for long.

Seconds later,it deepened,their bodies pulling together like they‚Äôd forgotten the rest of the world existed.

I leaned against the doorframe and knocked my knuckles once against it.

They jolted apart like I‚Äôd hit them with a stun gun.

Desmond‚Äôs face darkened.‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù

I kept my tone flat.‚ÄúThis is my [gallery.Do](http://gallery.Do) I need permission to walk into my own space?‚Äù

My chest was tight.I could feel the pressure building behind my ribs.

This place‚Äîthis gallery‚Äîwas one of the last things my mother left me.I handed it over to him in my last life.I had trusted him with everything.

And this was what he did with it.

Desmond‚Äôs mouth pulled into a crooked smirk.‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs with the attitude?‚Äù

He let out a quiet laugh,the kind that always made me want to slap it off his face.‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been chasing after me since we were kids,[Cassie.Is](http://Cassie.Is) this the part where you pretend you don‚Äôt care?Playing hard to get now?‚Äù

‚ÄúC'mon,cut the act,‚Äùhe snapped,his tone sharp and ugly.‚ÄúWe both know you‚Äôre obsessed with me.You‚Äôll never let go.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt even blink.

‚ÄúSecurity,‚ÄùI said,loud and clear.‚ÄúGet these two out of here.And take down every single one of those paintings.Trash them.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚ÄùGwen cried out.‚ÄúDon‚Äôt throw them away!They‚Äôre all gifts from Desmond!‚Äù

She rushed at me,grabbed my wrist,and then collapsed.

Her body slammed into the coffee table,glass shattering beneath her.A sharp edge caught her leg.Blood trickled down her shin in a bright red line.

‚ÄúCassandra!‚ÄùDesmond roared.

He shoved me hard.

I stumbled back and slammed into a metal easel.Something warm slid down my cheek.I reached up,but I couldn‚Äôt feel [it.My](http://it.My) body was too numb.

Then Desmond grabbed a bucket of paint from the corner and hurled it at me.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gone too far!‚Äùhe shouted.

He swept Gwen into his arms like some kind of tragic prince and stormed out with her in his arms.

I sank to my knees in the middle of the chaos‚Äîtorn canvases,shattered glass everywhere.

""Where‚Äôs my mom‚Äôs painting‚ÄòSpring Bloom‚Äô?‚ÄùI asked,my voice hollow.

A staff member pointed toward the corner.His hand trembled.

I followed his gaze.

There it was.

The painting my mother had poured her soul into was her last work before she [died.It](http://died.It) had hung in this gallery since the day it opened.

Now it was ruined.Smeared in red paint like someone had bled across it.The vibrant colors were lost under the sludge‚Äîtwisted,smeared,defaced.

I stumbled over and sank to the ground in front of it.

‚ÄúMom‚Ä¶‚ÄùI whispered.

I clutched the wrecked canvas to my chest,ignoring the glass biting into my palms.Blood from my forehead dripped down onto the painting,mixing with my tears.

...

Wheels rolled softly across the tile floor.

I looked up.

There,just outside the reach of the light,someone sat watching me.The sharp edge of a silver mask caught the glow,polished and cold.But behind it,his lashes were trembling.

Terrence D‚ÄôAngelo.

‚ÄúStop crying,‚Äùhe said.His voice was low.Steady.Not unkind.

His eyes flicked to the cut on my forehead,then quickly looked away.

‚ÄúHere.‚Äù

He held out a small tube of ointment.His hand was steady,but when our eyes met,his fingers curled slightly and pulled back.

‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt use it,‚Äùhe said quietly,‚Äúit‚Äôll scar.‚Äù

I looked at the ointment in my hand,still stunned.Then something clicked.

The D‚ÄôAngelo family.Of course.

They were the most respected medical family in the city.They were behind almost every hospital and pharmaceutical breakthrough.They practically ran the entire healthcare industry.

As I reached for the medicine,I felt his fingertips tremble just before he pulled away completely.

‚ÄúI know you were forced to pick me,‚ÄùTerrence said,his voice rough.

He spoke slowly,like every word cost him something.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll cancel the [engagement.You](http://engagement.You) don‚Äôt have to force yourself.‚Äù

Chapter 3

A soft,rusty creak announced the wheelchair's turn,the prelude to his leaving.

‚ÄúWait!‚ÄùI rushed forward,stepping in front of him.

He stopped short.His head turned sharply to the side,as if he didn‚Äôt want me to see his expression.

""I meant what I said,""I told him,steady.I met his eyes and didn‚Äôt look away.""You‚Äôre the one I chose.""

His hands clenched the armrests so hard his knuckles went pale.The tips of his ears turned a deep,vivid red.

A long pause hung between us.

Then,barely audible,Terrence said,""Mm.""

...

Over the next few days,boxes of medicine and supplements appeared at my door.

All from Terrence.

The wound on my forehead had scabbed,healing slowly.But every time I changed the bandage,I remembered how red his ears had gotten that day,how stiff and nervous he looked.And every time,something warm settled quietly in my chest.

A few days later,I stepped into a luxury boutique and practically walked into a scene straight out of my nightmares.

""Desmond,I love all of these!""Gwen‚Äôs sugary voice floated through the air when I walked in.

Her fingers brushed across her stomach,subtle but intentional.

Desmond‚Äôs voice followed,indulgent and cool.""Then get them all.Put it on Cassandra‚Äôs tab.""

I stepped further inside,my cold laugh cutting clean through the air.

Desmond spotted me,but he didn‚Äôt even flinch.

No guilt,no hesitation.

""You pushed Gwen the last time you saw her.She got hurt,""he said,like he was reading from a script.""This is compensation.""

Gwen's eyes lit up the moment she saw the jacket I was wearing.

""Desmond,""she said,breathless,""I really want Cassandra‚Äôs coat.""

The shop assistant looked trapped.""I'm sorry,but this coat is a global,limited edition.Ms.Mercier reserved it six months ago.""

Gwen looked down,playing the part.Her voice dropped to a whisper.""It‚Äôs fine.Someone like me doesn‚Äôt deserve something that expensive.""

And right on cue,her hand found her stomach again.

Desmond's eyes narrowed.

Then he turned to me,voice like stone.""You have more clothes than you could ever wear.Give her this one.""

I stared at him.""Why should I?""

‚ÄúCall it compensation,‚Äùhe said,voice dipping lower.‚ÄúYou shoved her at the gallery,and her knee‚Äôs still bruised.‚Äù

Just as I opened my mouth to respond,Gwen suddenly wobbled.

Desmond caught her,instantly alarmed.""You okay?""

""I‚Äôm fine,""she murmured,weakly shaking her head‚Äîthen,again,touched her stomach.

Desmond turned to me,his voice cutting.""Cassandra.Give.Her.The.Coat.""

I let out a short laugh and turned to the two bodyguards posted by the door.""Throw them out.""

But they hesitated.

One of them said softly,""Ms.Mercier,you‚Äôre marrying into the Caldwell family eventually...maybe you should just hear Mr.Desmond out.""

Before I could respond,Desmond shot them a look.

That was all it took.

Next thing I knew,I was slammed onto the cold marble floor.Pain shot through my back.

""Take it off,""Desmond barked.

The shop assistant stood frozen,horrified.""Sir...""

Desmond looked down at me and sneered.

Then,he turned to the assistant and said,""Don't bother.She‚Äôs been chasing me for years.After we get married,I‚Äôll be the one calling the shots anyway.""

The assistant trembled as she reached for the coat,undoing the buttons with shaking hands.

When they yanked it off me,my whole body trembled with fury.

I wanted to scream,to claw the smug look off his face.

Desmond gently wrapped the coat around Gwen,his voice soft.""Gwen,you look way better in it.""

Gwen bit her lip.""But...is this okay?What if Cassie gets upset,Desmond?""

Then Desmond whipped out his phone and started snapping photos of me,disheveled,humiliated,on the floor.

‚ÄúCassandra,‚Äùhe said coldly,‚Äúif you ever come after Gwen again,I‚Äôll make sure the whole internet sees you like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúDesmond,you're a shameless man,you deserve to die!,""I retorted.

My fists clenched tight,nails digging into my palms.

The look on his face was exactly like the one from my past life‚Äîarrogant and shameless.

One of the shop assistants finally moved,stepping forward to hand me a silk [scarf.No](http://scarf.No) words.Just quiet solidarity.

I wrapped it around myself and walked out,head high,chest burning.

...

When I got home,bruised and shaken,my father took one look at me and froze.

The antiseptic smell was thick in the air.A teacup rested on the table beside him.

He picked it up and hurled it across the [room.It](http://room.It) exploded into shards against the wall.

""That goddamn Caldwell brat laid hands on you?""His voice was thunder.""We‚Äôre dealing with the Caldwells.Now.""

Chapter 4

‚ÄúDad,don‚Äôt work yourself up,‚ÄùI said,wiping sweat from my brow.‚ÄúI‚Äôve got my way of handling them.But first,we need to deal with the snakes already inside our walls.‚Äù

One week before the wedding,I went to the cemetery alone.

The sky hung low,an overcast sheet of gray,and the air was thick with stillness.I knelt in front of my mother‚Äôs tombstone,fingers gently sweeping away the dust settled over her name.

‚ÄúMom,‚ÄùI whispered,‚ÄúI'm not making the same mistakes this time.‚Äù

Right then,my phone buzzed in my pocket.

I glanced at the [screen.It](http://screen.It) was a bank notification.

\[$50,000,000 withdrawn.\]

The breath caught in my throat.

I immediately dialed my assistant.

‚ÄúMs.Mercier,‚Äùshe answered,voice shaking,‚Äúsomeone forged your signature.They cleaned out the account.Every cent is gone.‚Äù

...

Twenty minutes later,I stormed into Gwen‚Äôs freshly opened studio.The door slammed behind me,and the room went still.

‚ÄúDesmond,you cheap man!‚Äù

The name cracked out of me like a gunshot.Everyone froze.

‚ÄúWho gave you the right to touch my trust fund?‚Äù

Desmond turned toward me,slow and smug,like he‚Äôd been waiting for the moment.

‚ÄúCassandra,‚Äùhe said coolly,‚Äúyou‚Äôve bullied Gwen repeatedly.That money?Consider it your apology.‚Äù

Then he raised his voice,projecting it for everyone in the room.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting married anyway.It‚Äôll all be joint property.Don‚Äôt be so petty.‚Äù

My pulse pounded in my [ears.Black](http://ears.Black) spots clouded my vision.

And then I saw a necklace,gleaming against Gwen‚Äôs collarbone.

It was my mother‚Äôs pearl necklace.

The one I‚Äôd locked away in a safety deposit box.

I pointed at her.‚ÄúTake that necklace off!‚Äù

Gwen blinked fast and stepped behind Desmond,her lip quivering.

He frowned,clearly irritated.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just an old necklace,Cassandra.‚Äù

‚ÄúI said,take it off!‚ÄùI lunged forward and grabbed at it.

The strand snapped,pearls flying across the hardwood floor like shattered promises.

Before I knew it,my hand lashed out.

I slapped Gwen hard across the face.

She shrieked and stumbled back,clutching her cheek like I‚Äôd branded her.

Desmond shoved me.

‚ÄúAre you insane?!‚Äùhe roared.

I slowly straightened,stared him dead in the eye,and didn‚Äôt so much as flinch.

He faltered,just slightly,taking half a step back.

His Adam‚Äôs apple bobbed as he muttered,‚ÄúI-It‚Äôs just a damn necklace‚Ä¶no reason to blow this up.‚Äù

I dropped to my knees and started gathering the pearls,shaking my hands.Each one was dull with dust and no longer shining.

Just like the love I‚Äôd once believed in‚Äîcrushed under his heel repeatedly.

...

Back in the car,I sat gripping the velvet pouch so tightly that the veins in my hands stood [out.My](http://out.My) whole body burned.

Then,I opened my phone.

And there it was,blazing across social media.

\[#HeiressPubliclyStripped\]

Front and center.

Photos of me:coat gone,hair a mess,humiliated.Gwen wrapped in my jacket,leaning into Desmond‚Äôs chest like some tragic love story.

The caption read:

\[What‚Äôs stolen will never truly belong to you.\]

I stared at the screen for a second.Then turned it off.

That line?

I gave it right back to her in my head,ice cold.'What‚Äôs stolen will never truly be yours,Gwen.You've done enough in my past.Not this time.'

The backlash hit fast and brutal.Comments flooded in like knives.

\[Mercier heiress really is a joke.Her fianc√©straightened her out.\]

\[Look at that pathetic expression.Geez,no wonder she gets stepped on.\]

When I called my assistant,my voice was eerily calm.‚ÄúScrub everything.Every post.Every photo.I don‚Äôt care how.‚Äù

Then,I added,‚ÄúAnd I want that money back‚Äîevery dollar.I don‚Äôt care how we do it or who we have to pressure.If the bank delays,get the legal team involved.And if anyone tries to stop us‚Ä¶‚Äù

I let out a quiet,humorless laugh.

‚ÄúLet them learn what happens when they mess with the Merciers.‚Äù

...

The morning of the wedding,my phone rang.

Desmond.

His voice slid through the receiver,smug and relaxed like nothing had happened.

‚ÄúCassie,‚Äùhe said,like we were old friends.‚ÄúAbout the necklace‚Ä¶You really scared Gwen.She‚Äôs pregnant.She can‚Äôt handle that kind of stress.‚Äù

I stood in front of the mirror,lipstick in hand.I dragged the crimson across my lips slowly,deliberately.

In the reflection,my expression didn‚Äôt waver.

Cold.Composed.Lethal.

‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs why you leaked the photos?‚ÄùI said lightly.‚ÄúTo calm her nerves?‚Äù

Desmond scoffed.‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget that your dad‚Äôs mining project still depends on my family‚Äôs contacts.Without me,who‚Äôs going to help you?‚Äù

Chapter 5

I carefully set the lipstick down,letting my fingertips tap a soft rhythm along the edge of the vanity.

On the other end of the line,Desmond spoke like he was offering me a favor,not a threat.

‚ÄúHow about this?‚Äùhe said.‚ÄúTransfer fifty percent of your shares to Gwen as a gift for the baby.‚Äù

He chuckled,smug and casual.‚ÄúAnyway,once we‚Äôre married,what‚Äôs mine is yours too.‚Äù

In the background,Gwen‚Äôs voice chimed in,sugar-coated and delicate.‚ÄúDesmond‚Ä¶‚Äù

Instantly,his tone melted like butter.‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move,[sweetheart.Be](http://sweetheart.Be) careful with your belly.‚Äù

Then,like flipping a switch,he was back to business,continuing,‚ÄúAs long as you agree,I‚Äôll be at the wedding on time today.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt give him a single word.

I ended the call,blocked his number,and didn‚Äôt look back.

...

When Terrence entered the hall,it was like someone had dropped a glass at a funeral.All conversation stopped,replaced by a low wave of shocked murmurs.

He was in his wheelchair,dressed in tailored black and still wearing that signature silver mask.But when his eyes met mine,they softened.They were warm and steady.

And then‚Äîboom.The doors slammed open.

Desmond barged in like the lead actor showing up late to a play,wearing a spotless white suit and flashing that same arrogant grin‚Äîuntil his eyes landed on Terrence beside me.

That smug expression collapsed like a house of cards.

‚ÄúCassie,‚Äùhe said,his voice shaking.‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on?‚Äù

His eyes narrowed in on Terrence,like he couldn‚Äôt believe what he saw.‚ÄúTerrence?!What are you doing here?!‚Äù

The whole room had gone quiet.Of course it had.

Terrence D‚ÄôAngelo didn‚Äôt go to events like this.Not ever.

I stepped forward and placed myself squarely between them.

Desmond‚Äôs face darkened,jaw tight.‚ÄúCassandra,it‚Äôs our wedding day.And you brought him here?What kind of twisted game are you playing?‚Äù

Right on cue,Gwen stepped out like she‚Äôd been waiting in the wings,one hand resting daintily on her barely-there baby bump.

‚ÄúCassie,‚Äùshe said sweetly,‚Äúeven if Desmond‚Äôs been spending more time with me lately,did you really need to drag a cripple here just to get back at him?‚Äù

I took a slow breath,trying not to let my temper spike.‚ÄúDesmond‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúEnough!‚Äùhe snapped,grabbing my wrist like he had any right.‚ÄúStarting today,I‚Äôm your husband.And this is how you behave?!‚Äù

I ripped my hand free,eyes locked on his.

Then came the emcee‚Äôs voice,booming through the speaker system:

‚ÄúLadies and gentlemen,welcome to the wedding ceremony of Miss Cassandra Mercier and Mr.Terrence D‚ÄôAngelo.‚Äù

1lay5a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lay5a1/an_arm_and_a_leg/,An Arm and a Leg,"Word Document 1:
Hi there, the name‚Äôs Edward Finnic. I‚Äôm an investigative journalist from Reno, Nevada. I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre all familiar with my work but I mostly cover topics such as corporate corruption and government scandals. I think I found an interesting lead about a company called Collective Bios Inc. They specialize in privatized healthcare and research into prosthetics. 

What got me interested in them? For those of you reading my work for the first I suppose you wouldn‚Äôt be aware of the fact that I‚Äôm very much a unique individual. You see, I‚Äôve only got one and a half arms and barely a leg to stand on..... That‚Äôs a terrible joke by the way, my right leg only goes down as far as above the knee and my left only halfway down my shin. My right arm is reduced to a stub below the elbow and my left is the only working part of my body. Thank god I‚Äôm a lefty!

Among these wonderful circumstances I also have 70% hearing loss in my right ear and 40% in my left as well as near total blindness in my right eye and less than perfect vision in my left. I have to wear hearing aids and thick prescription glasses to function but it‚Äôs not so bad once you get used to it. I make it sound worse than it is honestly, I get by. I work out very regularly, including my stumps so I don‚Äôt get muscle atrophy from my damn wheelchair. 

I‚Äôm 34 now but I‚Äôve been this way since I was 22. My appearance actually helped my game with... partners.... maybe they feel bad or maybe they want to try something weird but I‚Äôm ok with it, everything still works like it should. As I said, I work out so I‚Äôm as fit as I can be. I always was an admittedly good looking guy and the incident didn‚Äôt do much to my face other than some shrapnel scars, my tattoos cover lots of those scars.

You may be wondering how I wound up with shrapnel scars. Well, I was a proud marine just serving his country in Afghanistan in 2008. I was always athletic and was named the most promising recruit before my tour. My unit was sent on surveillance to gather intel on a VIP. We had managed to slip into an enemy camp and proceeded to spy on them, unbeknownst to us they knew we were there. Before we could react a firefight ensued and took out some of my men, leaving us pinned in place. 

We had radioed for an emergency evacuation when one of the bogies shot a rocket from an RPG right next to the vehicle I was behind. The ensuing explosion had propelled my body and the truck about 20 feet away. Miraculously enough, my spine was ok but after waking up from my blackout I could see that my arm and both feet were pinned under the truck, crushed completely. The shrapnel also pelted my body in places, including my right eye and the sound mostly deafened me. My squad immediately got to work to pull me out as backup arrived to help evacuate us.

Once I had reached a point in the recovery process that I could function on my own - after years of mental and physical therapy - I finally started to try and live my new life again. My physical therapist - Evan - and I grew to be great friends over the years. When my therapy was done he let me move in with him. He needed extra help with rent, I needed a place to stay and it didn‚Äôt hurt he knew exactly what I needed help with and when I needed it. He got me through my darkest times when I wanted to end it all out of depression and frustration and come out on the other side a better man. I see the humor in it all and count my blessings that things weren‚Äôt worse, they definitely could have turned out that way.

Evan encouraged me to get the job I‚Äôve been doing now over the last 5 years and I love it. Whether I‚Äôm doing a piece about the good or bad in a business, you can be sure I give my honest opinions and get to the truth. It‚Äôs not hard to book those essential interviews and meetings as well as get full VIP access to places when you‚Äôre a decorated, injured veteran. It‚Äôs definitely worked to my advantages for sure. 

So enough with my backstory, you want to know why I‚Äôm so interested in Collective Bios Inc. (I‚Äôm shortening it to CBI from now on) right? An avid reader of my work has contacted me, saying he needs to meet with me and discuss the amazing things going on with this company. I‚Äôve agreed to meet him for lunch across the street from my apartment in about.... 20 minutes from the time of writing this. You can imagine how long it takes me to type this with one hand at this point I‚Äôm sure. I should really look into speech to text for the future.

Word Document 2:
I just got back from meeting my source. You can bet how surprised I was when I met a man who was also missing an arm (his left). He had an extremely rare condition in his eyes called heterochromia. Basically one eye was strikingly blue and the other a light brown. He told me he was chosen by CBI in Sacramento, among many applicants to test their new advanced prosthetics. 

He told me that him and about two dozen other arm amputees were all brought into a room where they could all sit at a table to sign many, many pages of legal documents: waivers, NDA‚Äôs and the sort to even look at the product. I‚Äôve left his name anonymous so he doesn‚Äôt face the legal repercussions (if he even is a he wink wink). He said that there were many more pages afterwards to agree to testing.

After what was undoubtedly an eternity of signing they were all brought into a white room, not unlike a lab. The prosthetic was brought out and he described it as being almost indistinguishable from a real arm. They were capable of replicating the skin tone of whoever held it, had small arm hairs, freckles or whatever blemishes a real arm would have. The researchers assured them that they can also take your fingerprints you used to have if they are on a record somewhere or make custom ones based off your DNA. Finally, they apparently can attach sensors to your nerve endings in your arms that send sensations from the prosthetic to your mind. In essence, it was a real arm to the touch and to wearers. 

A woman was the only one out of the 24 candidates that actually got to demonstrate the arm. As promised, over the course of about a minute it changed to match her skin tone and her nails changed to match the other hand. The arm reduced in size to fit her petite frame perfectly. After some mild pain and discomfort from the nodes attaching, she claimed that she could feel everything on the arm. Her tears of joy were enough to get everyone else desperate to get one. The only thing that wasn‚Äôt right was there was a crease were the arm met the real body. They were assured that this was just a prototype and they intended on using skin grafting to permanently bond the arm to give back people‚Äôs limbs for good. The researchers told everyone that they would have to come back tomorrow to get theirs.

The way he described them with such enthusiasm made me salivate at the thought of talking to CBI about their new ‚Äúmiracle product.‚Äù If I could verify the advancement in prosthetic technology to the degree they were promising, then I wouldn‚Äôt be doing my due diligence as a journalist to get the word out there! If they are phonies then I have an excuse to expose their fraudulent claims and end their money making schemes.

I made a hands free phone call with the PR manager of CBI and he was happy to oblige my meeting with the general manager of their Sacramento location by tomorrow morning. That‚Äôs about a two and a half hour drive but the way Evan drives it‚Äôs more like 2. I can check out this place for myself and maybe get a juicy insider scoop on this place.

Word Document 3:
After pulling up to the front doors, Evan let down my lift and told me that he was gonna go to one of the malls for a bit while I did this (he wasn‚Äôt invited in). He embraced me and touched my cheek as I shyly brushed him off. As soon as I wheeled through the door a grinning man was waiting at the desk. He was very unnerving with his nonstop smile and uncanny look about him. 

‚ÄúHi there Mr. Finnic! Mr. Piper will be here to see you shortly! Please grab these release papers and fill them out!‚Äù

His voice was very chipper and enthusiastic as he motioned fifteen feet to his left. The grin never leaving his face and barely blinking. His movements were also off, like when there‚Äôs a few frames missing in a movie. Subtle but noticeable. I didn‚Äôt want to take my eyes of him but felt I shouldn‚Äôt be rude. 

‚ÄúPlease have a seat over in our guest waiting area!‚Äù

I moved the chairs controls to go that direction. To try to break the tension I decided on a quip, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm already sitting, but thanks for the suggestion.‚Äù

He only responded with a very unnerving ‚ÄúOh!‚Äù Followed by a cackle and an unnatural rocking motion that kind of resembled a regular human-being laughing at something hilarious. Deciding to try and take my mind off of him I looked through the contract and read each line before signing. It felt like a Herculean effort not to turn back and look at the guy and keep signing. It was really basic stuff like any recording devices must be approved by CBI and that I understand I can‚Äôt take their property - you get it, nothing out of the ordinary.

After what felt like eternity - but was realistically only fifteen minutes - I heard the sound of dress shoes walking down the hall behind the double door by the desk. I rubbed my eyes under my glasses as the strain from reading was starting to give me a headache. After a few moments a man walked through, a very normal looking man in a nice suit. Slicked back hair, likely of middle eastern decent but no accent. No weird uncanny valley stuff here.

‚ÄúMr. Finnic, it‚Äôs good to finally meet the man I‚Äôve been hearing about.‚Äù He reached out his left, which I shook. 

‚ÄúLikewise, hopefully nothing but good news I hope.‚Äù I responded, ‚ÄúMr. Piper I presume?‚Äù

He nodded, big smile (natural at least), ‚ÄúRasheed from my mother and Piper from my father. I‚Äôve been reading your articles about all of these companies. You like to air their dirty laundry for the world to see, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell I wouldn‚Äôt exactly say I‚Äôm-‚Äú

‚ÄúNonsense! Eddie - may I call you Eddie? - I appreciate the hard work you put in,‚Äù he didn‚Äôt even give me a chance to respond, ‚ÄúThis honest journalism is sorely needed in today‚Äôs world. You give glowing recommendations to those that deserve and condemn the malpractices of those that don‚Äôt. I respect the truth, Eddie! We need more people like you! Tell it like it is! I assure you all of our secrets are out in the open! Come! Let‚Äôs discuss further in my office.‚Äù

He grabbed my papers, turned and walked to the double doors, the assistant - still smiling that smile - grabbed them and pressed a button to make the doors open. I looked back at the guy as I passed.

Rasheed noticed my sideways glance at the man, ‚ÄúI see you‚Äôve met Patrick! I know it‚Äôs weird for most people when they meet him for the first time. Your glasses probably don‚Äôt let you see as well as you would like I‚Äôm sure. He‚Äôs completely automated! The same robotics that goes in our prosthetics is used in lots of our robo-staff!‚Äù He laughed out loud, ‚ÄúClearly we haven‚Äôt quite gotten him to the point of being perfectly passable but we‚Äôre close!‚Äù

So he WAS a robot! That closed the door to that question but opened many more mysteries that needed solving.

I followed Rasheed down the hallway, he was still talking away and laughing at his own jokes but didn‚Äôt seem to care if I was paying attention (I wasn‚Äôt), he was just happy to talk. I studied my surroundings and noticed that every room was visible from the hall with glass, it was easy to see lab equipment and people hard at work. A group of medical students were being taken on a tour through the facility, being lead by another robot-person. CBI seemed to be passing the sniff-test so far, the lack of secrecy put my mind at ease a bit.

As we passed by one of the conference rooms I noticed all of the amputees in the waiting room in various stages of socializing. So workers that were prepping them for their new limbs were joking and being very personable with them. My source and I locked eyes and he waved and smiled, I instantly looked away to avoid implicating him or myself. I‚Äôm sure the cameras picked that up. It was a good thing I turned my gaze back ahead as I almost drove right into Rasheed. He didn‚Äôt seem to notice.

‚Äú...And here we are. Mi casa! Come on in.‚Äù

He opened the door and I was almost disappointed to see a very neat and plain office. There was a photo of him with a woman and a kid I assumed was his family. There was also a signed baseball encased in glass on his desk. Again nothing suspicious, just a legitimate man.

‚ÄúSo Eddie, can I get you something to drink?‚Äù

‚ÄúActually a water would be nice.‚Äù

He reached over to a speaker and held a button, ‚ÄúRuby, can I get a water for our guest please?‚Äù

A voice crackled over the speaker, ‚ÄúRight away, Mr. Piper.‚Äù

Leaning back into his chair he clasped his hands and leaned back in a relaxed pose, ‚ÄúWhat do you think of the facilities?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre quite nice actually, it‚Äôs nice to see people coming and going freely and having a good time on the job.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy to hear that! Please, if you have any questions now is the time. We have nothing to hide and I‚Äôm open to discussing whatever. We just want you to know that we‚Äôre genuinely looking to help make people better. And you can quote me on that!‚Äù 

He chuckled at that last part. ‚ÄòHelp make people better?‚Äô What an odd way the phrase ‚Äòhelping people‚Äô. Before I could think too much about it the door opened. A younger woman came in through the door carrying a bottle of water. Her hair and makeup were impeccable. A pretty smile was on her face. No flaws anywhere. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your water, Mr. Finnic.‚Äù 

Her movements were slightly off and her eyes were also not exactly right. She was also a robot, I assumed. She was much closer to realistic than Patrick, but still just weird enough that my gut feeling was telling me something was off. I smiled at her as naturally as I could force myself and took my drink, ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

She reached down and grasped the lid and turned it. The force from her grip deformed the bottle a bit, she was apparently not quite fully calibrated for strength. Her smile never left her face as she winked, ‚ÄúMy pleasure, Mr. Finnic.‚Äù

With my poor eyesight it was clear that she was impeccably flawless. From a distance I‚Äôm sure other young men would find her quite attractive. I was focused on how the skin wasn‚Äôt quite right, the teeth too white and her lips were permanently colored red, no lipstick involved. If I didn‚Äôt know better she looked exactly like a stereotypical housewife from the 1950‚Äôs, dressed like it too. In fact, all the robo-people were dressed like that when I really think back.

Still cheerful, Rasheed spoke, ‚ÄúThanks Ruby.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill there be anything else, Mr. Piper?‚Äù Her sing song voice sounded too natural for the body. So did Patrick‚Äôs now that I think about it.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre good here, run along now.‚Äù

She smiled at me again and walked out.

‚ÄúRuby is part of our second run of robots, as you could tell we were not quite all the way there with realistic people in that batch. Patrick was part of the first so he‚Äôs a little more noticeably fake.‚Äù He took a sip of his brandy from his desk and sat back again.

‚ÄúI gotta ask...‚Äù I tried to get the words out.

‚ÄúAbout the robots, right? Ruby is anatomically correct as most men want to know I‚Äôm sure. Patrick though is like a Ken doll.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ Wasn‚Äôt even thinking-‚Äú

Rasheed burst out laughing, ‚ÄúI know you weren‚Äôt Eddie, I‚Äôm only teasing! But for real though, if you want a girlfriend from the next generation we‚Äôre working on maybe we can arrange something!‚Äù He winked and took another sip of brandy.

‚ÄúYa... not so much interested in that‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBeing serious Eddie,‚Äù I hated how casual he was with me, ‚ÄúWe developed them in conjunction with the prosthetics to see how realistic we could make them. You know, test out the physical sensation sensors, skin tones and movements without putting actual humans at risk.‚Äù

This made sense to me, ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôve pretty much just started the testing phase for humans, then?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly! We just reached a point where safety isn‚Äôt a concern at all. Beyond a mild discomfort for the sensor nodes to attach themselves to your nerves, it‚Äôs painless!‚Äù

He proceeded to explain everything that my contact did earlier. By the end he left out an important detail. ‚Äú....And with advanced skin grafting techniques it makes a seemless skin to skin match. No one will know you have a prosthetic.‚Äù

Without thinking I blurted out, ‚ÄúBut right now there‚Äôs a noticeable crease where joints meet right?‚Äù

His smile disappeared for only an instant, but a half smile came back just as quick. I immediately regretted sharing something I shouldn‚Äôt have known. ‚ÄúWell I suppose that is an issue on the current prototype, but no one has seen it yet.‚Äù

Thinking fast, ‚ÄúI just assumed that was case since you mentioned the skin grafting. That would likely only happen later I assume.‚Äù Nice catch.

Full smile again, ‚ÄúAbsolutely!..... would you like to see it?‚Äù

He lead me into another room further down, different from where all the other amputees were. Inside were some men in suits and lab coats. There were some suitcases: One large and two small. I was weary going in but they were acting casually, drinking and talking. They looked our way and politely turned to us, ending their conversations. 

‚ÄúAfternoon gents.‚Äù Rasheed greeted the guests. Some nodded back. ‚ÄúI take it that the drive in was alright.‚Äù

One man spoke up, ‚ÄúThis must be the subject?‚Äù

Subject? Me? What was he talking about?

Rasheed spoke up and turned to me, ‚ÄúI know this might seem as a surprise, but of course Mr. Litwick had to speak out of line and ruin it.‚Äù He glared towards Litwick‚Äôs direction and smiled back at me. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you talking about?‚Äù I questioned.

‚ÄúI apologize for the ruined surprise but we wanted to ask you - with your permission of course - if you wanted to be our first client with our latest tech.‚Äù

I was flabbergasted, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt afford that!‚Äù

A woman spoke up, ‚ÄúNonsense, like our other volunteers from the control group you won‚Äôt be charged a penny.‚Äù Not a bad idea. ‚Äú...In fact.... we are willing to pay you handsomely for the privilege of being the first successful subject.‚Äù

I noticed that Rasheed had went over to a security guard in the room and whispered something in his ear. The man nodded and walked out immediately, talking on his ear-piece. I turned my focus back to the group.

‚ÄúBut I was told that your prosthetics are only in the testing phase.‚Äù

Another man in a lab coat answered, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs only for the consumer model, the core product has already been designed.‚Äù

Rasheed joined back in, shit-eating grin on his face, ‚ÄúLots of the other items we have with us today are already available by other companies. We partnered with other like-minded businesses to help build our ‚ÄòBots‚Äô.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a decorated war veteran who lost a lot serving our country. You‚Äôre also an influential and well-regarded journalist who people trust to give them the truth. We just want word to spread of the good we‚Äôre doing here!‚Äù

I was kind of just stunned, sitting in silence contemplating. Get working limbs back and get paid for it. It was too good to be true.

The woman spoke again, ‚ÄúI know it seems too good to be true,‚Äù she had to say it, ‚ÄúBut you must trust us here. Let us show you. I‚Äôm Justine Linden, CEO of SmartEyes Inc.‚Äù 

She kind of curtsied a little and moved to the first suitcase. I had heard about their contacts that can record what someone sees for video footage. It even edited out the blinks when watching it back. The suitcase had two sets of what looked to be contacts of some sort. Justine continued, ‚ÄúWith these new contacts, you will have natural 20/20 vision again.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhile I‚Äôm wearing them?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, they bond completely to your eye seemlessly. Never needing to be changed or removed. They can‚Äôt be taken out. This set is yours as of today.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe my hearing aids aren‚Äôt set right, you‚Äôre saying that my sight will be back. No glasses?‚Äù

Litwick interjected, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. Speaking of your hearing aids, you won‚Äôt need those either.‚Äù

The next suitcase opened up and there was two small disks the size of small watch batteries in the large case. I was awestruck at what exciting news was next.

‚ÄúThese devices - provided by Hearing and Wellness Enterprises - will permanently act as your replacement eardrums. They are completely water proof and act like the real thing, without the danger of losing your hearing again. They auto-calibrate within Nanoseconds to react to noise so it‚Äôs always at the most comfortable by the time your brain receives the signal. You could go to a shooting range or watch a live concert and have it always be a comfortable level.

The other suitcase was left completely shut. ‚ÄúAnd what about that one?‚Äù

Rasheed answered, ‚ÄúIts just more parts for something else we‚Äôve been working on.... are you ready!?‚Äù

I could only nod and hardly contain my anticipation. I know I should have been skeptical and cautious but the excitement and adrenaline clouded my judgement. The man in the lab coat grabbed the contacts with a special device. As he approached me he said to remain still and remove my glasses. I complied and the machine flashed. What had seem like only a mere flash apparently lasted much longer than that. The room was empty other than the man in the coat taking notes with his assistant. I could hear Evan yelling at someone as I looked up at the clock and saw 8:23pm. It‚Äôs been 4 hours since I arrived. It didn‚Äôt feel like that long. 

Looking around I realized the vivid detail of the clock and realized it was over 30 feet away. I also took note of my depth perception being back to even be able to tell this. Evan was also not in the room either. He was down the hall. Feeling my face I looked in the mirror. It was just my face, nothing on my face or in my ears. I was almost me again. No limbs still though. From over my shoulder in the mirror, Patrick the robot practically leapt at me from behind. His face creeping up out of nowhere.

‚ÄúJesus Christ!‚Äù I yelled as I faced him. With my new super vision I could see the fakeness of his skin and smile. There was definitely a high grade plastic look to him that was uncanny. His hair unmoving and solid like a doll. His teeth and inside the mouth was convincing though and his eyes were disturbingly human for a walking doll, I could see an almost sad expression by peering into them despite the unnerving smile. ‚ÄúPatrick you startled me!‚Äù

He let out that weird hearty laugh where he rocked back and forth again. I wanted to get away from this (guy?)(thing?) as soon as possible.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sorry to hear that, Mr. Finnic!‚Äù The movement of his jaw freaked me right out when he talked. The voice sounded right but not the way it moved. ‚ÄúI was sent to collect you for travel! Mr. Piper has already met your friend! They‚Äôre having a meeting at the front desk now!‚Äù

As we were leaving I noticed the men in the lab coats also look up at me. It was much more subtle that the other two, but my new vision made it so I couldn‚Äôt help but notice their inhuman imperfections. They were also robots. The workers in the labs as we passed by the glass doors were all also not human either.

Going through the doors I saw Evan yelling at Rasheed, who was calm as ever. Ruby was standing, statuesque beside him unmoving. Patrick went back to his desk and Evan rushed over to me as soon as he had noticed me.

‚ÄúEd, are you ok!? I came to get you and it‚Äôs been hours! They had me wait and wait and wait until finally I got fed up..... where‚Äôs your stuff?‚Äù He looked confused at my missing hearing aids and glasses. I had never seen Evan in such high definition before. His nose was bigger than I remembered and he had a small mole on his cheek that I never noticed as well. He was well groomed though.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need them. They gave me free tech that fixed me!‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve told you many times, you don‚Äôt need fixing! You sound like my father‚Ä¶‚Äù Evan turned his attention back to Rasheed, ‚ÄúI thought this was just an interview!? How could you-‚Äú

Rasheed interjected, still smiling, ‚ÄúAs I was trying to tell you, Mr. Rothstone, the side effects of our machine is unconsciousness. It‚Äôs for his own safety so he doesn‚Äôt accidentally do something to effect the procedures. He agreed to it and signed the paperwork. You can see I would say it‚Äôs been an amazing success!‚Äù 

Did I sign for that when I filled it all out? Looking back I don‚Äôt think I did but I was absolutely ecstatic about having my hearing and sight back - better than ever!

During the conversation I eyed up Rasheed. He was definitely human. Unlike everyone else who turned out to be a robot, his movements were completely natural and casual. He stood with his hands in his pockets, jacket unbuttoned. Ruby looked faker than ever standing beside him, but she wasn‚Äôt as creepy as Patrick. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to sound rude or ungrateful Mr. Piper, but I am getting all of my limbs too?‚Äù

‚ÄúBaby steps Eddie! It would be irresponsible to give you new limbs when you already have to get used to new sensory input! We wouldn‚Äôt want to damage the goods by accident or give you too much sensory overload at once right? It could be dangerous!‚Äù He handed me a check, ‚ÄúCome back one week from now, same time and we‚Äôll start with the new prosthetics. Please feel free to spend this on whatever you need. There‚Äôs more on the way!‚Äù He shook my left hand and walked with Ruby through the doors.

Truth be told I was getting overwhelmed by my new senses, everything seemed so much more zoomed in than usual and every sound the perfect consistent volume. Evan‚Äôs anger dissipated when he saw the zeroes on the first check. We would likely splurge a little on ourselves. 

‚ÄúSoooo‚Ä¶‚Äù Evan seemed almost ashamed of how he acted. ‚ÄúSame time next week?‚Äù

Patrick‚Äôs creepy overexcited voice called out, ‚ÄúWe can hardly wait for your next visit!‚Äù His expression should have read as happy but I swear I saw a tear leave those overly realistic eyes.

Getting used to my own new eyes has given me time to process this info and actually type it. Remember, I only have one hand to type with so this took awhile. In two days I‚Äôll be back for my prosthetics.

Word Document 4:
Evan drove me back to my appointment. I never noticed the scenery between Reno and Sacramento changed so much in the two hour trip. At least not in colors as vivid as this. (the trip back last time was in the night). When we arrived outside I told Evan that the machine would likely put me to sleep again, and to go see a movie or do some shopping until I called him. Wheeling in to the lobby was Patrick with his creepy smile. 

‚ÄúHowdy Mr. Finnic! Please go in to the same room! They‚Äôre expecting you!‚Äù He was so cheerful it made him creepier.

‚ÄúThanks Patrick...‚Äù as he buzzed me in his eyes followed me, his strangely realistic eyes juxtaposed with his fake plastic look made me shudder.

As I passed by the conference room where the volunteers were I noticed they were all getting a checkup by more ‚Äúmen‚Äù in lab coats. They probably passed in the eyes of the subjects but I noticed all the perfect imperfections in their designs with my new vision. I noticed my informant was nowhere to be seen at all. The only one absent. I brushed it off at the time as maybe he was in the bathroom. 

The same room as last time‚Ä¶ Rasheed - who was leaning on the suitcase table - greeted me as I strolled in, ‚ÄúEddie! Good to see ya! I take it your adjustment period went smoothly?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost too natural now.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great news!‚Äù

As he stood up and moved I noticed that where there was two smaller suitcases there was now three and the large one still remained. Of the other bodies in the room (out of about 13) only three were human. Ruby, the lab assistants, and other ‚Äúemployees‚Äù were automatons. Justine and Mr. Litwick were silently taking notes and observing me - no doubt recording feedback on my new implants. The automatons all had an unnerving smile on them.

One of the bots in particular caught my attention as it also had heterochromia like my source. It looked nothing like him though. What an odd design quirk, I had thought.

Rasheed called out to that robot, ‚ÄúAndrew, can you open the cases?‚Äù

That wasn‚Äôt my sources name so it eased me a little. I felt like I was going crazy. ‚ÄòAndrew‚Äô answered with a chuckle, ‚ÄúRight away sir!‚Äù

He opened the small cases only. Inside was two legs exactly the right lengths and a right arm to size. I‚Äôm sure it was just my new eyes but I could see the slight fakeness to it which upset me a little; still, it was the most convincing one available. One of the ‚Äúmen‚Äù in lab coats approached me with the machine again. With a simple flash I was sitting in the room alone with Andrew and Rasheed (who was leaning back with his feet up).

I rubbed at my eyes with my right hand to refocus a little. That‚Äôs when I realized that I had a right hand again. It felt so natural that I subconsciously did it. I pinched my skin and - while I could see the perfect imperfections of it - I felt it, the pain I mean. I let out an audible ‚ÄúOw‚Äù which notified them of my alertness. 

‚ÄúGood evening, Mr. Finnic! How is it? It feels real right?‚Äù

‚ÄúJesus.... it really does‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure with your advanced sight you can tell it looks slightly fake but I assure you to anyone else it looks seamless and completely believable!‚Äù He looked pleased, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you try walking?‚Äù

I was so amazed by my arm that I didn‚Äôt even realize my feet were back. My shorts were the same but I had two bare legs with feet again. The physical sensations made me feel like me again, other than the impeccably perfect, unnatural skin. I thought I would struggle to my feet but I stood up almost as naturally as I would have before. I almost immediately lost my balance from not being used to it and fell forward. Andrew caught me, ‚ÄúEasy there, pal!‚Äù

His face was on full display for me to see up close. That creepy grin that all of them had was there. The eye sockets were not quite right around the real eyes. The eyes themselves were brown and blue like I mentioned earlier. There was so much detail in them and looked so completely real. As I gained my balance what looked like a tear escaped his eye. He instantly set me up and turned his head toward Rasheed (away from me).

‚ÄúEddie, you‚Äôre standing again buddy! How does it feel? Like you‚Äôre on a boat with no sea legs I bet?‚Äù

At first I did have to regain my balance, but it wasn‚Äôt too bad to take a few steps. The cold floor was chilly to the touch (Can you imagine what that felt like for the first time in years?) as my new feet felt everything. After 30 more minutes of tests it was like I had never lost my limbs in the first place. They gave me a pair of socks and shoes and I called Evan. I didn‚Äôt tell him about the legs yet as I wanted to surprise him.

At the front doors Evan was smoking outside and looking at his phone as I approached him. When he heard my footsteps he looked up. The lit cigarette fell onto the sidewalk and he threw his phone onto the drivers seat without looking (lucky that it landed safely in there). He ran up to me and embraced me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre walking again, Ed! I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre walking!‚Äù

‚ÄúI know! I know! I got my arm back too!‚Äù The two of us spent so much time together rehabilitating me that we were both a little sad that it felt like a waste and yet so incredibly happy that it lead to this. I‚Äôm not gonna lie, we both wept outside with tears of joy. After getting my new legs it pained me to sit again so soon, but I got to ride in the front seat this time.

We picked up some fast food and no one inside so much as glanced at my prosthetics. I don‚Äôt mean in an ‚Äúlet‚Äôs avoid looking at them‚Äù way, I mean a casual, everyday way. What a relief! We decided to drive to an abandoned lot where I tried out my driving skills to see if I still remembered how. It was like riding a bicycle as the saying goes. 

Now that I‚Äôm home, I‚Äôve been up all night typing this so my recollection stays with me (much faster - might I add - with two hands!). I have an appointment back every week for checkups for the next two months. With the big paychecks, I plan to buy both of us new cars. It‚Äôll be a huge surprise to Evan I‚Äôm sure. Of course I insist on driving myself to my appointments now that I can!

Word Document 5:
My checkups have been going good, next week is the last one. With every visit there have been less and less of the volunteers at the office. I initially thought that they just finished up their tests; now I‚Äôm not so sure.

A benefit AND downside to my new hearing is that I accidentally overhear things I know I probably shouldn‚Äôt. One time I went for coffee after my appointment and I overheard some cops - sitting in their vehicle outside - discuss the high rate of missing amputees. There was no way.....

Walking back to my new car I noticed a woman putting up a sign on the street light. She tore down a weathered copy from before and put a fresh one up. Even from up the block I could see it perfectly when she moved out of the way. I dropped my coffee.... on the lamp post was a picture of Stuart Bendis: my contact on a missing poster. 

I‚Äôve been up all night trying to dig something up on CBI. The company has only been around since Rasheed‚Äôs father - Stephen Piper - ran it from his garage. Mr. Piper married Aanisah Abadi, daughter of wealthy oil tycoon Adnan Abadi. His wealth helped finance the company and turned it into the powerhouse it is today. Rasheed turned to robotics research after his parents got into a fatal accident that left them both catatonic. He wanted a way to make them normal again.

I managed to dig up some dirt as well, Rasheed has been charged with criminal negligence towards patients in the past, resulting in a death. This was covered up thanks to some crooked dealings, but it was on public record. Looks like he‚Äôs not so perfect after all. What else are you hiding? One last checkup. This is the last time I have an excuse to be there. I‚Äôll use my stealth training to really dig up some dirt when I go.


Email to Evan:
I dont have much time evan if you‚Äôre looking for me, im at cbi when I got here for last visit I uncover somthng awful in secrity office I found ruby is his mom patrck is dad i found out and tred to get hom fast they caus accident burned all real skin except left arm crawl out of reckage men took me and put me in new body.,, i don look lik me, im now called cecil. voice isn‚Äôt mine and cant control own body,:.

SEND HELP HE WILL SEE THIS!!!?;:&&Vvgb nlp  


Evan‚Äôs note: 
I can‚Äôt believe everything I just read... I found his notes on the computer after I found the email. I went with the cops to find him at CBI but everyone denied it. That bastard Piper looked me straight in the eye and denied all of it! He said that Ruby and Patrick were the only robots. Everyone else was real. The rest definitely looked it except their smiles. He denied having one named ‚ÄúCecil‚Äù. He claimed no one with that name even worked there. The cops were free to question any staff and look over any necessary footage as well.

There was one worker in particular that had a steady stream of tears running down his face but he still smiled and continued mopping. The baby blue were a match for Ed... I would know those eyes anywhere.... the cops called me crazy. Rasheed Piper said he would charge me with defamation of character. With no proof I linked eyes with that janitor one last time before swearing I would be back.

I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll do it but I‚Äôll get Ed back.",1,1749869118.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

#### The Digital Nomad Dream: Europe‚Äôs Siren Call

Europe. The continent that whispers sweet nothings to every laptop-wielding wanderer. Cobblestone streets. Wi-Fi that (usually) works. Caf√©s that double as offices, bars, and confessionals. The myth? Every day is an Instagram story. The reality? Sometimes, it‚Äôs just you, a cold espresso, and a deadline that doesn‚Äôt care about time zones.

Europe isn‚Äôt just a playground. It‚Äôs a proving ground. The stakes? Your freedom. Your sanity. Your bank balance.

#### Visa Vortex: Navigating Legal Labyrinths

Schengen. The word alone can trigger heart palpitations. Ninety days in, ninety days out. The shuffle is real. But there‚Äôs a loophole for the clever: hop between Schengen and non-Schengen countries‚Äîthink Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro. Outfox the system, don‚Äôt get caught napping.

Some countries are rolling out the red carpet with digital nomad visas. Estonia, Portugal, Greece. Bureaucracy with a smile‚Äîsometimes.

#### Cost of Living Roulette

Europe‚Äôs a patchwork quilt of price tags. Budapest for the penny pinchers. Zurich for the trust-fund kids. Your wallet‚Äôs fate is sealed by your choices. Some cities bleed you dry. Others let you live like royalty for the price of a sandwich.

The secret? Mix and match. Splurge in Paris, recover in Porto.

Public Wi-Fi is a gamble. VPNs are your armor. Never trust a network named ‚ÄúFreeCoffeeShopWiFi.‚Äù

#### Weather Roulette: Chasing Sun or Embracing Snow

Chase the sun in Valencia, dodge the drizzle in Dublin. Europe‚Äôs weather is a mood swing on steroids. Some thrive in the Mediterranean blaze; others crave the Nordic chill. Seasons dictate your workflow, your wardrobe, your happiness.

Nomad life can get lonely. Unless you know where to look. Coworking spaces are the new watering holes‚ÄîLisbon‚Äôs Second Home, Berlin‚Äôs Factory, Barcelona‚Äôs Betahaus. Real connections happen over bad coffee and good Wi-Fi.

Meetups, Telegram groups, and secret Facebook collectives. Your tribe is out there. Find them before isolation finds you.

Blend in. Or stand out. Just don‚Äôt be invisible.

Most of Europe is safe. But complacency is a luxury. Pickpockets in Barcelona. Scammers in Rome. The old ‚Äúfound ring‚Äù trick in Paris. Stay sharp. Trust your gut. Don‚Äôt flash your tech like a tourist.

Solo? Stick to the lit streets. Group up when you can. Safety is the ultimate productivity hack.

#### Transport: Getting Around Without Losing Your Mind

Trains are Europe‚Äôs veins. Fast, efficient, often scenic. Planes for the long hauls, scooters for the last mile. City bikes for the eco-warrior. Apps like Omio and BlaBlaCar are your secret weapons.

#### Language Barriers: Lost in Translation

English gets you far. But not everywhere. Learn the basics‚Äîhello, thank you, coffee, Wi-Fi password. Locals appreciate the effort. Google Translate is your lifeline. Charades, your backup plan.

Language isn‚Äôt a wall. It‚Äôs a door. Knock politely.

#### Work-Life Alchemy

Hire an accountant. Or risk a fiscal hangover.

#### Healthcare: Don‚Äôt Get Sick, But If You Do‚Ä¶

Europe‚Äôs healthcare is world-class. But access isn‚Äôt universal. Insurance is non-negotiable. Some countries roll out the red carpet; others make you jump through hoops.

Know the nearest hospital. Keep your documents handy. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.

#### Hidden Gems: Off the Tourist Conveyor Belt

Everyone flocks to the big names. But the real magic? It‚Äôs in the shadows. Tbilisi‚Äôs bohemian buzz. Lviv‚Äôs literary cafes. Lake Bled‚Äôs fairy-tale calm. Go where the crowds aren‚Äôt. That‚Äôs where you‚Äôll find yourself.

Secret islands. Mountain villages. Places that don‚Äôt trend‚Äîyet.

Lisbon. The digital nomad‚Äôs promised land. Sun, surf, startups. Berlin‚Äîchaotic, creative, never boring. Barcelona‚Äîwhere work and play blur. Tallinn‚Äîdigital government, analog charm. Prague‚Äîhistory with a side of hustle.

Each city has its rhythm. Find yours.

Belgrade‚Äîgritty, unfiltered, alive all night. Budapest‚Äîthermal baths by day, brainstorms by night. Krakow‚Äîwhere history meets hustle. Cheaper, edgier, less polished. But that‚Äôs the point.

The wild frontier. For those who want the road less traveled.

#### Mediterranean Magic

Work by the water. Live like a local.

Looking to transfer to UCF next year. I have an apartment near West Palm Beach and am familiar with the Orlando area and I‚Äôve had my mind set on moving there for a while.

Im 22 and currently work full time as a barista. I pay about $1300 for just myself in a 2/2 here!! It‚Äôs insane. Orlando is a bit cheaper and has a huge coffee community so I‚Äôd like to continue pursuing that + my math degree there!! 

My current lease ends December 5 2025 but i‚Äôd like to be moved into an apartment by end of November (29-30) just to give me ample time to get my stuff there and adjust.

My budget is around $1000 each for a 2/2. I‚Äôm open to really anywhere around downtown Orlando or near UCF. Either is fine since I‚Äôm not currently in school and I work full time- about 40 hours. 

I‚Äôm looking for a year lease! I‚Äôm pretty quiet and keep to myself and enjoy TV, cuddling my cat, getting coffee, baking, traveling and sewing. Sometimes I visit my BF in Tampa or he‚Äôll stay for a few nights. Other than that we‚Äôre pretty quiet and usually go out when we see each other. 

I also have a cat named Milk- shes very sweet and cuddly and loves people, however Id prefer someone without pets only because my roommate bought a surprise kitten and it has been very aggressive towards mine üò¢ She‚Äôs done great with other animals in the past but i think this one left her and I both scarred üòî

I‚Äôm pretty clean but not a neat freak and I don‚Äôt really drink or smoke. Im usually up pretty early anyways because of my job so not much energy to do that LOL. I also like hardcore + screamo so sometimes I go to local shows.


Let me know if we‚Äôd be a good fit!! Thank you : D

To preface this isn‚Äôt really a breakup by all conventional terms, but it sure feels like one.

I‚Äôm a 21-year-old male college student. This past year, I worked as a Resident Assistant (RA) in my dorm. At the beginning of the last semester, our college hired a new RA ‚Äî I‚Äôll call her Lucy.

When we first met, it was nothing more than casual coworker interaction. She had a boyfriend, and I had no interest in her. We would chat during RA shifts, but that was it.

Then one night, Lucy texted asking for help with homework. I said sure, and she came to my room. After we finished her homework, she stayed and we talked ‚Äî about life, school, dreams, travel ‚Äî all night long. In the morning, we grabbed coffee and watched the sunrise. At the time, I didn‚Äôt think much of it, just that she was cool to be around.

I tried to keep some distance after that because I knew she had a boyfriend and didn‚Äôt want to overstep. But about a week later, Lucy came to my room crying ‚Äî she‚Äôd broken up with her boyfriend. I consoled her, and from that point, something shifted in my mind. Now that she was ‚Äúavailable,‚Äù I slowly started to develop feelings I guess, though I still tried to be a supportive friend rather than pursue anything.

Over the next month, we grew extremely close. We started sleeping together, texting constantly, hanging out late every night. For the first time in my life, I opened up to someone. I told her things no one else knew ‚Äî not my parents, not my best friends. I found myself falling harder and harder for her and becoming emotionally dependent. When I was with her, I was genuinely happy. When I wasn‚Äôt, everything else felt empty.

For a couple of months, we were basically in a relationship, though not officially. Those months were some of the happiest days of my life. We went out to eat, visited museums and parks ‚Äî we did nearly everything together.

Then, in the last month of the semester, things started changing. Lucy began calling her ex again. She texted me less and didn‚Äôt want to sleep over anymore. We spent less time one-on-one. Her moods were all over the place ‚Äî some days she‚Äôd want affection, other days she‚Äôd pull away or be upset for no clear reason.

Looking back now, it‚Äôs clear to me: she was using me. She‚Äôd still ask me to take her out to dinner but would expect me to pay. She‚Äôd ask for help with homework, but then kick me out when it was done. She‚Äôd ask me to come over to help with chores, or for a massage, but then tell me to leave so she could call her ex ‚Äî supposedly to ‚Äústay in touch.‚Äù Eventually a couple weeks before graduation, she told me they had gotten back together.

By graduation, we were still hanging out a bit, though more as friends. When we left school, we said goodbye and promised to stay in touch.

But then, out of nowhere as summer was starting, she texted me and said we would probably never talk again ‚Äî no explanation. I assume her boyfriend told her to cut me off, but I can‚Äôt say for sure.

And now‚Ä¶ I just feel empty. I miss her so much ‚Äî her texts, her voice, the time we spent together. Yes, I still have other friends, but it feels like I‚Äôve lost a part of myself. I‚Äôm struggling every day. It‚Äôs like I was on a drug high and quit cold turkey.

I‚Äôve mostly moved on from having romantic feelings, but I miss her dearly as a close friend ‚Äî someone I trusted and leaned on. It hurts that I let myself get so vulnerable and attached, and now she‚Äôs just gone from my life. In hindsight, I see that she used me for comfort, money, time, and attention while going through her breakup ‚Äî and once she didn‚Äôt need me anymore, she dropped me.

I feel so stupid for falling for her when I didn‚Äôt even mean to. And I‚Äôm angry ‚Äî at her, at myself, at the situation. Part of me still desperately misses the happiness I felt with her, because now I‚Äôm stuck in this depression. But another part of me is furious that she toyed with my feelings and discarded me when it was convenient.

If anyone‚Äôs been through something similar, or has advice on how to process this and move forward, I‚Äôd appreciate it. I just want to stop feeling so empty.  I want to stop crying every night and having thoughts of suicide.  I just feel so broken, useless, and worthless.  ",1,1749868478.0,Situationships,0,1.0,False

i‚Äôm the first new hire in a little bit over a year, so most of the staff knows each other pretty well and everything. the closest person i have to being a friend so far is my boss.

i‚Äôve worked in cafes before, was a barista for 4 years prior! so i felt confident going in and working at this coffee shop especially since its queer and neurodivergent friendly!

since my first day, ive felt constantly left out besides with my boss. for example, today it was me and two other people scheduled (typically two are scheduled on a weekday, but there was an event nearby) and every time i left the bar to do a task, i noticed the other two baristas would talk to each other and when i walked in they‚Äôd separate again.

ive been trying to reframe this as maybe they don‚Äôt have that social cue or something is going on that‚Äôs not revolved around me. but. i swear this happens almost every shift for about a month now.

i just feel really sad. really left out. all of the customers are super sweet and actually constantly hype me up and 2 of the other baristas are like ‚Äúwow people really like you‚Äù but they said it kinda passive aggressively?

of course i‚Äôve dealt with something similar like this before in my tiny barista career, but this is severe. this happens daily:-/. i sobbed after my shift because i thought it‚Äôd be better by now, but i just feel so targeted. i haven‚Äôt heard anyone talking about me directly- and if/when i do, i would confront them kindly and be like ‚Äúhey! if i‚Äôm doing this wrong you can tell me, you don‚Äôt have to talk about me!‚Äù

a new person was just hired this week and they start tomorrow, so hopefully i can get a better vibe of if im targeted or if this is normal from their staff?

does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? i‚Äôm really trying to be optimistic and i know it takes time but i really have no one to talk to in my direct life that knows how to deal with this.

TLDR: new barista, four years of experience, first hire in over a year, every time i leave the bar all other baristas go into a huddle and talk- or they directly have convos in front of me without me- feeling left out and self deprecative:-/ even when i heard the other baristas talk to each other, it sounds like awkward or forced convos. i just want some hope.",5,1749868298.0,barista,4,0.86,False

I'm hoping you can all provide some advise on how to fix my coffee table!

As you can see in the photos, I accidently removed the patina look finish and wax on my coffee table when trying to remove a small stain. 

The coffee table is the reclaimed elm one one here ([Beachwood - Reclaimed Elm Coffee Table](https://beachwood.com.au/products/reclaimed-elm-coffee-table?srsltid=AfmBOopMo9aTfqpdlrIqR_VpBzno2ThO1XcDYA4xPGLNRi8m8jOBOrlb)).

I contacted the supplier and they recommended sanding back and re-waxing the entire thing! Which I'm hoping to avoid given the work involved and a concern that I wont achieve the same patina look/finish.

I explained to them it's only a small spot where I have exposed the original timber and asked if they could help me understand how to return the patina and finish. They kindly sent me some wax to try but it didn't return the patina. It just gave it a clear wax coating. 

From research I was thinking maybe a liming wax or similar but I don't want to damage the wood if I'm not on the right track!

Please help reddit! :)

1laxuo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/EndTipping/comments/1laxuo9/the_transactional_relationship_between_good/,The transactional relationship between good tippers and servers and bartenders creates theft.,"The idea that restaurants would need to increase their prices to pay their employees a minimum of $25 an hour is based  on itemizing the cost of everything on the menu and the supplies and stock needed to create each item.   Except,  in reality,   servers and bartenders often ""reward"" their ""good tippers""  with freebies.  This essentially means the customer is bribing the server or bartender to steal from the owner or restaurant.

Most ""good tippers""  like I used to be,   knew that we'd likely get ""buy backs"" at the bar if the bar tender knew we tipped good.  That's why it became a transactional relationship to make sure the servers and bar tenders knew you had a reputation as a good tipper.

So for example let's say you have two $10 cocktails.   That's $20.   But instead of leaving $4  you leave $5 or $6.    But then the next time you come you get three drinks.   Bar tender puts a turned over shot glass in front of you.   So you know you get a free drink.    You pay $10  and you still tip $6.   Most bar tenders only ""buy back"" a  third drink.    So let's say you pay $20  you tip $8 just to even it out with tax.   Next time you come you get a free third drink,   

 You get a free drink,  the bar tender gets a nice tip.  And the owner loses $10 in sales.   Now imagine multiplying this by dozens of people a week. 

For an industry that has a hard time staying in business,  these kinds of money losses really add up.  Now translate it to tables  and freebies like beverages,  food items, deserts,   cappuccinos rung in as coffees etc.

It's a weird system that basically encourages the customer to be complicit in the employees stealing from their bosses.    Owners are likely aware of this.  If they paid a salary and tips didn't matter, the customer would likely spend more money in the restaurant.",7,1749868166.0,EndTipping,12,0.77,False

Day 1: In the afternoon, Tinder showed me his name on the blurred-out Likes list, something propelled me to swipe left on all other guys in the area to look for him specifically. He finally popped up, nerdy, tall, with a goofy smile. I liked him. But my likes ran out for the day.¬†

Day 2: I tried to look for him again; this time, I was able to match. Soon, a message popped up saying hi. Within three exchanges, he said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs meet up for coffee or a walk sometime.‚Äù I agreed, but he had to drive to Joshua Tree with his family, who were visiting from out of state.¬†

Day 3: Joshua Tree trip. We were texting throughout the day. ‚ÄúI wish you were here with me.‚Äù And I reciprocated the same feeling. In the afternoon, he decided to invite me for a walk later that night, even though his feet hurt from walking all day in the park. Turned out he lived 3 miles from me. Later that night, I was on a call, with my app open and waiting for his message telling me he was at my apartment. Call ended, time of the scheduled meetup had already passed. I tried sending a message asking if he was here, it said ‚ÄúNot delivered‚Äù. I panicked, closed the app and reopened. Turned out he was there half an hour ago, and I never got the massages until then. Feeling extremely sad, I thought I screwed it up. Sent over a few messages explaining what happened and apologized. ‚ÄúI thought you weren‚Äôt interested or you were messing with me, so I left. I was sad.‚Äù ‚ÄúCan I come again, or is it too late?‚Äù Of course, it wasn‚Äôt too late. He drove over, we walked along the trail next to my apartment building and sat near the pool. We talked about our interests, our dating history, everything in between. It was sort of an awkward conversation because we both were introverted, and didn‚Äôt know how we were feeling about each other so we were reserved, but by the end of the night, we did exchange numbers. ‚ÄúI really enjoyed our conversation tonight, I thought we were on the same wavelength.‚Äù I went to bed with the biggest smile on my face.

Day 4 to 6: Downtown Disney and the San Diego visit. He had to drive his family to San Diego for a 2-day trip. The entire trip he was sharing photos with me, telling me how he had the biggest smile on his face thinking about me. During our texts, we realized not only did we live close to each other and have similar personalities and interests, but we also had some similar lived experiences, similar birthdays, and our leases in this town end within days next to each other, and neither of us had reasons to stay here. The day he came back from San Diego, we met up again, this time I opened up completely. On the walk, I grabbed his hand, he kissed me. It was the kind of spark I had never felt in my entire life. He drove me back home and kissed me goodbye, in my mind I had imagined us years later sitting on the porch remembering this exact moment (I sound crazy I know). Over text after we were both home, we exchanged our feelings towards each other. At that moment in time, it really seemed like this was the once-in-a-lifetime encounter. The uncanny similarities in both of our lives only confirmed that.¬†

Day 7: GMAT day. All this time, I had been prepping for my second GMAT attempt. I wasn‚Äôt in the best mindset for it. Mock tests hadn‚Äôt been good. However, because of him, I somehow didn‚Äôt feel any pressure or anxiety. He had told me that he was initially going to quit his job, and his job paid him a bonus to keep him, now he‚Äôd ride this wave with me till the lease ends, and we would figure out our future together. I sent him a playlist I had made, with songs and lyrics that reminded me of this encounter with him. I couldn‚Äôt focus on reviewing that day, ‚ÄúDo you wanna‚Ä¶just come over?‚Äù Come over, he did. We had the best time together, all before he had to drive me to the test. For the first time in my life, I felt seen, and supported, by someone I was romantically involved with. I didn‚Äôt do as good as I would‚Äôve wanted on my test, but somehow I was ok with it. He picked me up from the test center, and I took him to my hometown food for dinner. We drove to his apartment after that, holding his hand, for the first time in my life, driving in the Californian sunset. ‚ÄúI want to know all of you.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôve deleted myself from all dating apps.‚Äù Same, and same. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never felt the same about anyone before.‚Äù ‚ÄúMe, too.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to just be my summer fling.‚Äù Good, cause I never planned to.

The shutdown. The plan was for me to stay over. ‚ÄúI want all of you.‚Äù 10 minutes later, ‚ÄúI thought I was ready for a relationship, but I‚Äôm not, I need to slow down.‚Äù He drove me back, kissed me goodbye. In my head, I was confused, hurt, and didn't know how to react or what to do. Day 2 I texted saying hi, and was met with a cold good morning. Asked what was going on, nothing. I was left wondering if I did anything wrong. Days later, he texted and said he wanted to give some clarity, saying he had severe relationship anxiety from his last relationship, and did care about me and was sorry that he made me feel bad. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm destined to be alone, and I‚Äôve accepted that.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going back east to look for a place to live.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm willing to work through it with you, just don‚Äôt run from this, please.‚Äù Nothing.¬†

It sounds ridiculous to mourn a seven-day encounter, I should know. But this was something special, this felt like meeting the one but it quickly imploded. I‚Äôm leaving out most details in this to protect my sanity but trust me, it was real. I lived it. My brain chemistry is slowly changing though, now I recognize this might not have been meant to be, and with the SF trip coming up, the clock is ticking. He beamed me up, took me to the clouds, and dropped me like a rock. But I think something awakened in me, the idea of me not being wanted that was there for all my life, is slowly fading. I‚Äôm sure I will heal, but this encounter will probably always be there in my mind.¬†

‚ÄúHe took me out of my box

Stole my tortured heart

Left all these broken parts

Told me I‚Äôm better off‚Äù

1laxk0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1laxk0u/im_confused/,I‚Äôm confused,"Has anyone dated symphony/orchestra musicians? What are they like? In my experience interacting with three so far, two have been pretty self-absorbed and steam-rolly. I‚Äôm talking to a third one and he has been courting me a bit more than what I usually see on the apps. Sometimes I find him too intense for my taste, especially when he uses colorful language. I just want to understand if I‚Äôm being avoidant here (I‚Äôm usually of the secure attachment style) or if he is love-bombing me, lacking self-awareness or something else.

Some of the things he has done so far (we haven‚Äôt even met yet):
* Claims that we will definitely get along well
* Overshared and ranted about parenting logistics while cussing - during our very first text exchange 
* Kept on emotional dumping on me and asking me personal questions too soon for how long we have been texting
* Talks about his ending marriage as ‚Äú‚Ä¶my marriage exploded. Putting out the fire and then giving up and cutting our losses took up most of my energy‚Äù 
* Described my dead marriage as having a rot 
* Texts constantly and responds immediately. He has my notifications on and apologized when he was a few minutes late in responding
* I was on the other coast for a conference and he texted me seven times in a day even when I told him that I would be busy.
* Shared unsolicited details of his summer camp expenses on his kids
* Asks me questions as if we have known each other for a very long time
* invited me to see his performance, buy me dinner and drinks
* keeps saying that he really wants to meet me, can‚Äôt wait, etc. 

I was on the verge of unmatching with him after the seven texts but gave it more than a day of cooling down and just sent him a dry, brief text. He seems to have gotten the message and his texts have been a lot more balanced now. 

For more context, both of us are finalizing our divorces and are single parents. He has been sending me pics of pretty things he clicks, and recordings of him practicing music (he is amazing). He talks in a romantic, descriptive tone. I feel like if he kept this up, I could potentially fall for him. But should I?

i just want to post something i‚Äôm proud of. a few years ago, someone i thought was a close friend started being less responsive. too busy to hang out, even just for a quick coffee or something.  i was panicking.

after about a year of slowly backing off, we went out for dinner.  she acknowledged that it was her fault that we never hung out anymore.  but the whole dinner felt like a goodbye.  i went home feeling foolish for trying so hard to hold on to a friendship that no longer existed.

it hurt. badly.  i stopped reaching out, and, unsurprisingly, i stopped hearing from her.  there some was a big step.  it took a long time to heal from that.  but i did.

today, three and a half years later, she reached out to say hi.  wants to know how i am. how the kids are.

i indulged a bit and then let her know that i took her silence as not wanting a friendship anymore.  she came up with excuses.  but i‚Äôm not biting.

it feels good to not feel the desperation i usually feel. even a year ago, i would have pounced at being friends again.

i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm done seeing this boundary.  but i know i‚Äôll see it through.  it feels really good.

1laxhid,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1laxhid/we_waited_for_his_friends/,We Waited for His Friends,"There‚Äôs a kind of silence you only find out here you know the type, flatland silence. Heavy. Wide. The kind that doesn‚Äôt end, just settles around you like dust.

I‚Äôve been working the 'site' going on five years now. Middle of nowhere, out past the grain elevators that haven‚Äôt seen a train since before I was born. One building. One fence. No signage. Just a rusting radar dome, half-buried in prairie grass, like it was built to listen to the stars and then got forgotten when nothing answered.

My dad worked here before me. Two decades, give or take. Before that, he was Army ya know ... back when the wars were in jungles and deserts. He never talked about it unless there was whiskey in the glass and the lights were low, and even then, you‚Äôd get more out of the cigarette smoke than his words.

I followed him in, did my own time. Different war. Different jungles, different desert. Still sand in the boots.

When I got back, I drifted for a while. Picked up work where I could‚Äîwarehouses, truck stops, road crews. Nothing that stuck. Then the site called when pops knees started hurtin. No interview. No questions. Just a badge and a rotation sheet with my name already printed.

Folks say it was a listening post, or maybe part of some old satellite program. Cold War stuff‚Äîback when the government still thought the stars might be talking. It‚Äôs decommissioned now. ‚ÄúStructurally intact, externally monitored,‚Äù or some such nonsense. That‚Äôs what the forms say. They don‚Äôt say what‚Äôs inside. I don‚Äôt have the keys.

But they pay on time, and that‚Äôs more than most.

Nights are long out here. Nothing but the wind moving through the wheat and the odd coyote who hasn‚Äôt figured out the fence doesn‚Äôt buzz anymore. I walk the perimeter, log my rounds, sit in the shack with a thermos and pop's old flashlight. I keep it pointed toward the dome, even though nothing ever happens.

That‚Äôs the funny thing about places like this.

Nothing ever happens‚Ä¶ until something does, and usually when it does, it ain't worth logging.

The shack‚Äôs about the size of a garden shed. Tin roof, two windows, a little desk with warped corners, and a folding chair that wobbles when you lean the wrong way. There‚Äôs a space heater in the corner, but it only works when it wants to. Most nights I just layer up and drink hot coffee slow.

I‚Äôve got an old radio out here. Doesn‚Äôt pick up much besides grainy AM talk shows and church music from across the state line. Sometimes I leave it on for the company, just low enough to mix with the wind. There‚Äôs a kind of comfort in half-heard voices, like listening to ma and pops talk in the kitchen while you're in bed half asleep.

The logbook‚Äôs still the same one my pops used. His handwriting‚Äôs there‚Äîtight, all-caps letters from a time when he still cared enough to write neat. I don‚Äôt keep it that clean. Just scribble the rounds, time stamps, anything that looks out of place. Not that anything ever does.

I park my truck behind the shack where the wind won‚Äôt sandblast the paint. Keep a cot in the back in case I want to stretch out during the slow hours, though I rarely do. Sleep doesn‚Äôt come easy out here. Not because it‚Äôs scary‚Äîjust... too quiet. Too still.

Out beyond the dish, the land just keeps going. Flat and brown in the cold months, green and waving in summer. No houses. No lights. You could walk a mile in any direction and still feel like you‚Äôre standing in the same spot. It‚Äôs beautiful in that hard, indifferent way some parts of the country are. The kind of place that doesn‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre here or not.

I don‚Äôt see people much. There‚Äôs a guy named Morris who handles daytime site checks‚Äîmakes sure the fences haven‚Äôt caved in or caught on fire, I guess. We nod when we pass on shift change, maybe share a word or two about the weather. That‚Äôs enough.

It‚Äôs not much of a life, maybe. But it‚Äôs clean, it‚Äôs quiet, and it‚Äôs mine.

Some nights, I think about taking a break.

I‚Äôve got a cousin down in Clearwater‚Äîruns a garage, fixes up old boats when the tourists aren‚Äôt breaking down on the interstate. He always says I oughta come visit, see what saltwater smells like. Says he‚Äôs got a spare room with a view of some palm tree he‚Äôs named Sheila.

Lately, I‚Äôve been thinking he might be right.

Maybe take a few months. Let him show me the boardwalk, buy me a beer, let the sun bleach the quiet outta my bones. I‚Äôve even considered asking if he‚Äôd want to cover a few shifts out here. He‚Äôs got the discipline for it. A man who can fix a carburetor in August heat can probably handle the silence.

It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm sick of it out here. It‚Äôs just... the days don‚Äôt change. You line enough of ‚Äòem up, and the years start to go blurry. Like fence posts out a truck window.

So, yeah. I‚Äôve been thinkin‚Äô about shaking the dust loose a little.

I was leaning back in the shack chair one night, mid-thought about the taste of grilled snapper and whether I even own swim trunks anymore, when I noticed it.

Not a noise. Not a bang or a crack or a shift in the wind.

A glow.

Faint. Yellowish. Barely there.

It was coming from inside the building under the dish.

Now, that dome‚Äôs been dark since I started here. Long before, too. The outer glass is caked in dirt and prairie dust so thick it‚Äôs like looking through pond water. But there it was‚Äîa flicker, way in the back, like someone struck a match in a room they weren‚Äôt supposed to be in.

I blinked. Sat forward. Waited. Nothing.

No movement. No follow-up.

Just the night. Just the wheat.

I told myself it was the moon catching on a scratch in the glass. A trick of reflection. Hell, maybe the radio tower two counties over finally threw a signal strong enough to bounce.

Still...

I kept the flashlight pointed that way a little longer than usual on my next round.

I told myself I‚Äôd mention the light to Mo in the morning.

Not that he‚Äôd care. He‚Äôs more likely to shrug and blame it on moonshine reflections or my flash light's reflection. But still‚Äîfelt like the sort of thing you‚Äôre supposed to say out loud. The kind of note that clears your conscience, just in case.

‚ÄúHey, saw a flicker in the dome last night. Might‚Äôve been nothing. Thought you oughta know.‚Äù

That was the plan.

I sat back down, rubbed the sleep from my eyes. Thought about grabbing another cup of coffee, but I was warm, the air inside the shack still carrying the last breath of the heater‚Äôs sputter.

Maybe it was the quiet. Maybe it was the way the wind had settled. Maybe it was just the kind of tired that doesn‚Äôt come from doing anything‚Äîjust being somewhere for too long.

Either way, my eyes shut.

Not all the way. Just that heavy-lid kind of doze you get after midnight, where you can still hear the hum of the walls and feel the weight of the thermos in your lap.

That‚Äôs when something beeped, not my casio reminding me of my next shift‚Äîsharp, mechanical, and way too close to my ear.

I opened my eyes.

But what really woke me‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶was the sound.

I blinked a few times.

The shack was just as I‚Äôd left it. Heater ticking in the corner. Radio murmuring static and gospel.

Nothing had moved.

But something felt off. That prickling behind the ears kind of wrong. Like you‚Äôd missed a step in the dark.

I rubbed my face, reached for the thermos‚Äîthen paused.

Outside, just past the fogged glass of the shack‚Äôs north window, the radar dish was no longer facing west.

It had shifted.

Barely‚Äîmaybe a few feet. But enough that I noticed the change in silhouette.

I stared at it for a long while. Tried to convince myself it was an illusion. A trick of the eyes. Maybe the wind nudged it.

But the night was still.

Too still.

And then I heard it‚Äîlow and bone-deep‚Äîthe metal-on-metal groan of something heavy turning against its will. A sound thick with rust and age, like teeth grinding on ice.

It crawled up the back of my neck, settled behind my eyes. Made my teeth ache.

The dish had moved. Not by storm. Not by accident.

Something had turned it.

The staircase groaned under my boots as I climbed toward the module tucked beneath the dish. It sat about ten, maybe fifteen feet off the ground‚Äîsuspended, like it had been dropped there and forgotten.

The glow was coming from one of its windows.

The module looked just like I remembered‚Äîsteel-plated, dull with rust and prairie dust, its sides streaked with the kind of grime you only get from years of wind and sun. Cables spilled from its underside, disappearing into the dirt like veins feeding something that should‚Äôve died a long time ago.

One window caught my eye. Caked in dirt thick enough to write your name in. Behind it, a faint yellow light‚Äîuneven, flickering like an old flashlight in a drawer nobody checked anymore.

I stood there, staring.

Nothing moved.

Out of habit, I reached for the walkie. Gave it a tap, tried the switch again. Still dead.

So I climbed. The metal steps rang under my boots, each one louder than it needed to be. The air changed as I got higher‚Äîheavier, tighter. Like walking into a room that‚Äôd been sealed off for decades.

At the top, I leaned toward the door‚Äôs little window. Wiped the grime with my sleeve, squinting through the streaks.

Inside looked like a time capsule. Console panels, dust-choked monitors, plastic chairs nudged just out of line. Every surface was buried in age. Except‚Äîone screen was on.

Pale yellow. Flickering. Barely enough to see by.

Then something moved.

Across the room‚Äîcutting the light from the monitor. A ripple. A shadow. Just enough to pull your gut tight.

I stepped back. Slow. Cold air slid down my collar like a warning.

Something‚Äîsomeone‚Äîwas in there.

And for the first time in five years of nothing ever happening‚Ä¶ Something happened

‚Ä¶I wasn‚Äôt sure I wanted to open the door, I was unarmed.

I stood there with my hand near the latch, half convincing myself I hadn‚Äôt seen anything at all.

Just shadows. A monitor glitch. Dust on the glass.

Then I heard it.

A voice.

Not loud, not shouting. Just... speaking. Clear and calm, like it belonged to someone who didn‚Äôt need to raise it to be heard.

It wasn‚Äôt local. Had that strange, clipped rhythm I‚Äôd only ever heard overseas‚Äîlike those British liaison guys we worked with once in Ramadi. Real proper. Smooth, like their words were polished before they let them out.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù it said, polite but too still. ‚ÄúIs someone there?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer right away. My brain was still catching up.

Then, finally‚Äî‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

A pause, long enough to hear the low hum inside the module.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I was going to ask,‚Äù the voice replied.

It sounded almost amused. But not quite. Like someone trying on a smile they didn‚Äôt know how to wear.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm site security,‚Äù I said, hearing my own voice come out too flat, too slow‚Äîlike the job never really expected me to say that out loud. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not supposed to be in there.‚Äù

A pause‚Äîlong enough that I started thinking maybe it was done.

Then:

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

The words were soft. Precise. Like they‚Äôd been polished on the tongue for years before they were allowed out.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be here long. I‚Äôm just waiting.‚Äù

I stepped closer to the door, boots crunching on the frost-laced platform.

‚ÄúWaiting for what?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúFor friends,‚Äù the voice said.

That stopped me cold. Something about the way it said friends‚Äîlike it meant more than me. Like I‚Äôd already lost some kind of race I didn‚Äôt know I was running. The voice itself was a low rasp, almost ancient‚Äîlike a man too old for the world he‚Äôs still standing in.

‚ÄúDo I have anything to worry about?‚Äù I asked, my hand itching toward the drawer back in the shack where I kept a short Colt Python.

‚ÄúNo. You‚Äôre‚Ä¶ incidental. But my friends won‚Äôt cause trouble.‚Äù

The air tightened around me.

I swallowed. ‚ÄúSo what are you doing here?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was brought here,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúTo observe. To wait. And now‚Ä¶ to bear witness.‚Äù

‚ÄúBear witness? Witness what?‚Äù

A soft whirring started up behind the door. Mechanical, but off-tempo. Like breathing. Like memory.

‚ÄúTo you,‚Äù it said.

I blinked. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing in there? Why are your friends coming?‚Äù

A long silence.

Then: ‚ÄúThey are coming‚Ä¶ so I can leave.‚Äù

My throat dried out. ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù

No hesitation this time.

‚ÄúFar.‚Äù

I leaned in, ear near the door, and heard a shuffle. Something breathing. Something real.

‚ÄúThey will be here soon.‚Äù

I stood frozen, heart hammering dull and hollow in my chest.

Then, like a shrug wrapped in words:

‚ÄúBut while I wait‚Ä¶ we could talk.‚Äù

That shouldn‚Äôt have sounded like an invitation. But it did. Like someone offering a chair beside a grave.

‚Äú‚Ä¶About what?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou, of course.‚Äù

Something shifted inside. Like a chair dragged gently across linoleum. The air seemed to breathe back at me.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù it asked, curious‚Äînot invasive, but interested. As if my name were an ingredient in a recipe it was trying to learn by heart.

I hesitated. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to know who I‚Äôm speaking with,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúYou know of me. Seems only fair.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶Bill,‚Äù I lied.

A soft chuckle. Nearly human. Nearly.

‚ÄúHello, Bill. You walk here often. I‚Äôve seen you.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I work here.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. That‚Äôs what I meant.‚Äù

It spoke like someone who‚Äôd only heard human voices through speakers. There was a nearness to it, but always just a few steps off. Like an echo too eager to sync up.

‚ÄúDo you enjoy the silence?‚Äù it asked.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. Honest.

‚ÄúThen why stay?‚Äù

‚ÄúPays the bills.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see.‚Äù

A moment passed, and I tested it.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Can I open the door?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Firm. Final. Not unkind.

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm not done getting to know you, Bill.‚Äù

I looked down at my boots. Frost clinging in soft spirals.

‚ÄúYou always ask strangers this many questions?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt meet many strangers. Just you.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know what to do with that.

After a moment: ‚ÄúNot much to tell.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd still like to hear.‚Äù

‚ÄúGrew up near here. Dad had this job. Then I went to war. Different war. Came back when he got sick. Took over. That‚Äôs about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were a soldier,‚Äù the voice said. ‚ÄúDid you enjoy war?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

A pause.

‚ÄúDid you feel proud?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶Sometimes. Got some medals.‚Äù

Another pause. Then:

‚ÄúWere the medals worth what it cost?‚Äù

That landed hard. Not judgment. Just math.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt come here for therapy,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou with the VA or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean no harm,‚Äù the voice replied.

The wind brushed the dome like a question.

‚ÄúWhy do you care?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhy know me?‚Äù

Soft movement inside.

‚ÄúBecause they are coming. And they‚Äôll want to know if you‚Äôre my friend.‚Äù

That hit something deep and strange.

‚ÄúWhy does it matter if we‚Äôre friends?‚Äù

Long silence.

Then, quietly:

‚ÄúBecause friends aren‚Äôt afraid of each other.‚Äù

I cleared my throat, trying to steady the air between us.
‚ÄúWhere are your friends? When are they arriving‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúThey are coming,‚Äù the voice replied. ‚ÄúThey are here ... look above.‚Äù

I felt a flicker of tension tighten my chest.
‚ÄúAbove? What the ... ?‚Äù

Silence.

Then, faintly:

‚ÄúThere are a few steps before they land. Not everyone is a friend.‚Äù

The words caught me off guard. Land? In a place like this?

My head snapped up‚Äîtoward the sky, toward the edge of the dome‚Äôs shadow.

And then I saw it.

A light. Faint at first, like a distant star plucked from the heavens. But moving, descending, threading between clouds and prairie wind.

My breath hitched.
‚ÄúIs that‚Äî‚Äù I began.

‚ÄúNo, not a helicopter,‚Äù the voice said, cutting in calmly. ‚ÄúMy friends do not travel like that.‚Äù

The star cut through the darkness, swift and firm‚Äîwrong, but not anything I'd ever seen.
Within seconds it was above the dome‚Äîdirectly overhead. A massive round object of shimmering color, wobbling, humming with an energy that pinned me silent.

Inside, the voice softened.

‚ÄúThey are here, do you see them? Do you see my friends‚Äù it repeated.

I didn‚Äôt answer.

I couldn‚Äôt.

The thing‚Äîwhatever it was‚Äîhovered like judgment itself, silent but alive, pressing the air down until my ears ached and my teeth hummed. It was like standing beneath a storm that forgot how to thunder, but remembered how to watch.

Something ancient in me cracked open.

I dropped.

Not from pain. Not from any push.

I just‚Ä¶ dropped.

Hit the platform knees-first, hands flat against the cold steel, forehead soon after. My breath came in shallow gasps, chest heaving.

And then I did something I hadn‚Äôt done since my second tour‚Äîsince the firefight that pinned us under a shattered minaret‚ÄîI prayed. Quietly. Stumbling words. Scrambled ones.

‚ÄúPlease, God, just let it pass.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt remember how long I stayed there, whispering apologies and pleas like a child with a monster under the bed.

Then‚Äîjust as sudden as it came‚Äîthe hum stopped.

Gone.

Like someone had flipped off the sky.

Silence rushed back in, and with it, another sound.

Click.

The door opened behind me.

Soft. Careful.

Then it closed.

Another sound‚Äîfootsteps. Not boots. Not heavy. Just... light. Measured. Barefoot, almost.

My body went stiff. Breath caught in my throat.

I felt it behind me. Presence.

Then something touched my back.

A hand.

Not heavy. Not aggressive.

Just... a touch.

I flinched, eyes still shut tight.

But something in me cracked open again, softer this time. I opened my eyes‚Äîjust a sliver‚Äîface still turned downward.

What I saw...

Three long toes. Pale grey skin. No shoes. No sound.

The feet turned. Walked away.

I didn‚Äôt dare lift my head.

Then‚Äîa low whir, like a mechanism shifting into place.

And it was gone.

I don‚Äôt remember standing. Just the cold cot under me. My legs moved like they had their own orders‚Äîhalf-drunk, half-dreaming.

I sat there in the shack, staring at nothing.

The stars still hung above. The dish still loomed. And the silence‚Äîdeeper now‚Äîsettled back like nothing had happened.

Then came the crunch of boots on gravel.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù Mo‚Äôs voice. Closer. Warmer. Human. ‚ÄúWhat the hell happened out here?‚Äù

He stepped into the doorway, eyes squinting against the sunrise. ‚ÄúLooks like a damn storm blew through. Debris everywhere. Fence‚Äôs bent. One of the warning signs is hanging upside down.‚Äù

I looked up at him, slowly.

He stared at me for a second, like he was deciding if I was pulling his leg.

‚ÄúYou alright?‚Äù

I opened my mouth before I had a plan.

‚Äú‚Ä¶I think I met someone,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúSomeone?‚Äù Mo blinked. ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

I paused. The words felt too strange out loud. I rubbed my face, trying to ground myself in something normal.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I think it left.‚Äù

He frowned, took another step in. ‚ÄúLeft? Who left?‚Äù

I met his eyes for the first time and gave him the only truth I had left.

‚ÄúA friend,‚Äù I said quietly.

Then, after a breath‚Äî

‚ÄúAt least‚Ä¶ I hope a friend.‚Äù",3,1749866991.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Even though it‚Äôs self-paced, there are two dates listed as general guidelines.

For the last three days, I‚Äôve been working my butt off. The goal was to be a couple days ahead. I was under the impression that the assignment I just finished, which has been the most difficult and time-consuming assignment so far, was past due and supposed to be due on the 11th. I worked on that thing from 1 PM to almost midnight yesterday. Then today I got up at the ass crack of dawn and worked on it again until I finished around 4 PM.

Obviously, the ungodly amount of espresso I consumed and worn off by then. I was completely drained by the time I was finished. Hangry as fuck, too, I cut lunch short so I could get back to it and had nothing for breakfast except a coffee. It was only after I submitted it and looked at the grade book that I realized this thing isn‚Äôt due until the 15th and I don‚Äôt have anything else due until the 18th.

1laxfku,https://www.reddit.com/r/YourDigitalJourney/comments/1laxfku/creative_ways_to_use_hostingers_features_to_grow/,Creative Ways to Use Hostinger‚Äôs Features to Grow Your Online Presence,"Let‚Äôs be real‚Äîbuilding an online presence can feel like shouting into the void. You‚Äôve got your website, your social media, maybe even a newsletter, but how do you actually get people to notice? If you‚Äôre using Hostinger (and if you‚Äôre not, why the heck not?), you‚Äôve got a treasure trove of tools at your fingertips. The trick? Using them in ways that aren‚Äôt just functional but downright clever.

I‚Äôve been tinkering with websites since the days of dial-up (yikes, dating myself here), and in my experience, the difference between a ""meh"" site and a ""whoa, how‚Äôd you do that?"" site often comes down to how creatively you use your hosting platform. So, let‚Äôs dive into some unexpected, game-changing ways to leverage Hostinger‚Äôs features‚Äîno coding wizardry required.

[üöÄ Ready to supercharge your website? Get Hostinger hosting now](https://servicesforneeds.com/creative-ways-to-use-hostingers-features-to-grow-your-online-presence/)

# 1. Turbocharge Your Site (Without Breaking a Sweat)

Hostinger‚Äôs **boasted-for-a-reason** speed optimization tools are *chef‚Äôs kiss* for impatient internet users (so, everyone). But here‚Äôs the thing: speed isn‚Äôt just about keeping visitors from bouncing‚Äîit‚Äôs a stealthy SEO weapon.

* **Lazy load images like a pro** ‚Äì Sure, Hostinger‚Äôs caching helps, but did you know you can pair it with lazy loading plugins? Images only load as visitors scroll, so your site feels faster than a caffeine-fueled squirrel.
* **Use their built-in CDN** ‚Äì A Content Delivery Network (CDN) isn‚Äôt just for big-shot corporations. With Hostinger, it‚Äôs a no-brainer toggle. Turn it on, and your site loads quicker for folks across the globe. (I once had a reader in Australia thank me for my site‚Äôs speed. *Australia!*)

*Personal aside:* My first blog took approximately 47 years to load. After switching to Hostinger and tweaking these settings? Night and day.

# 2. Email Magic: More Than Just ""Contact Us""

Hostinger‚Äôs email hosting is often overlooked, but trust me‚Äîthis is where the fun begins.

* **Create a ""secret"" branded email** ‚Äì Instead of [`contact@yoursite.com`](mailto:contact@yoursite.com), try [`hello@yoursite.com`](mailto:hello@yoursite.com) or `team@yoursite.com`. Tiny detail, huge professionalism boost.
* **Automate like a boss** ‚Äì Set up autoresponders for common queries. Example: ""Thanks for reaching out! I‚Äôm currently buried under a pile of \[insert relatable chaos‚Äîmine‚Äôs usually coffee cups\], but I‚Äôll reply ASAP."" Humanizes your brand instantly.

And hey, ever thought of a *fun* email? Like [`confessions@yoursite.com`](mailto:confessions@yoursite.com) where readers share wild stories? One blogger I know did this and ended up with enough material for a book.

# 3. Staging Sites: Your Risk-Free Playground

Hostinger‚Äôs staging feature lets you test changes without nuking your live site. But why stop at testing themes?

* **A/B test your headlines** ‚Äì Swap out your homepage headline in the staging environment and see which version gets more engagement.
* **Practice your ""big redesign""** ‚Äì I once panicked and accidentally turned my entire site neon pink. *On a Tuesday afternoon.* Staging would‚Äôve saved me from that heart attack.

# 4. Databases for Non-Techies (Yes, Really)

The word ""database"" sounds intimidating, but Hostinger‚Äôs MySQL tools are surprisingly user-friendly. Here‚Äôs how to use them without needing a computer science degree:

* **Build a simple subscriber tracker** ‚Äì Beyond email lists, you can log reader preferences (e.g., ""loves cat memes"" or ""only here for the dad jokes"").
* **Store custom forms** ‚Äì If you run a small biz, save order details directly instead of relying solely on third-party tools.

*Confession:* I avoided databases for years because they seemed *too* techy. Then I realized it‚Äôs just digital filing. Now I‚Äôm weirdly into organizing data. Who knew?

# 5. Backups: Your Get-Out-of-Jail-Free Card

Hostinger‚Äôs automated backups are lifesavers, but here‚Äôs the kicker‚Äîyou can use them *creatively*:

* **Roll back to older content** ‚Äì Accidentally deleted your best-performing blog post? Restore it in seconds.
* **Test ""what if"" scenarios** ‚Äì What if you reverted to last year‚Äôs design? Now you can check without consequences.

*True story:* A friend of mine once updated her plugin and *poof*‚Äîsite gone. Hostinger‚Äôs one-click backup restore had her back online before she finished her panic chocolate.

# Final Thoughts: Experiment Like Nobody‚Äôs Watching

The beauty of Hostinger‚Äôs tools? They‚Äôre flexible enough for both newbies and seasoned web warriors. You don‚Äôt need to use every feature‚Äîjust the ones that spark *your* kind of magic.

I‚Äôll leave you with this: The internet‚Äôs crowded, but creativity isn‚Äôt. Whether it‚Äôs playing with staging sites or turning your email into a storytelling hub, small tweaks can make a big splash.

Now, over to you‚Äîwhat‚Äôs the quirkiest way you‚Äôve used your hosting tools? Drop a comment or hit me with your best ""oops"" story. (Mine‚Äôs still the neon pink incident.)

1laxeo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SonographyStudents/comments/1laxeo9/i_got_accepted_into_a_very_competitive_cardiac/,I got accepted into a very competitive cardiac program - here were my interview questions!,"Since I see a lot of posts asking about the interview, I figured I‚Äôd share how mine went as I got into a highly competitive cardiac program I‚Äôm really excited about! It was a group interview, and they asked 5 questions.

1. First was a written question: Why did you choose sonography? 

2. Tell me about yourself, including: work history, volunteer history, educational background and why you chose the specialty you did (general/abdomen, cardiac or vascular)

3. Describe a goal you failed at. Why did you fail and how did you respond to that failure?

4. Since sonographers use both their hands while looking at a screen or talking to patients, describe a task you do that you use both hands and multitask. Some said instruments they play, some said video games, I described my time in coffee pulling shots and making drinks while reading orders and talking to customers. 

5. Imagine we have 1 spot left‚Ä¶ why should we choose you?

Some extra tips: 

-I noticed a lot of people talked about why they‚Äôd be good sonographers and not the type of student they‚Äôd be, and judging the interviewers faces, they seemed to appreciate when people talked about how dedicated they‚Äôd be and how they‚Äôd perform in school. They want to know if they accept you, that you‚Äôll follow through and not give up when it gets hard. 

-Watch the interviewers faces to other people‚Äôs answers and adjust accordingly.

-If you have work experience unrelated to healthcare, be sure to talk about the transferable skills and how they‚Äôd apply to the program and in the field. Several people just listed job duties and didn‚Äôt tie it back to sonography, which made the answers unmemorable. 

-Include little tidbits you‚Äôve learned to show you really researched and are prepared for the demands of the job. Like I discussed MSK injuries and how I stretch daily and am building good habits now, to ensure I have a long career in sonography.

-Stay after and ask questions! I stayed to ask ‚Äúif I am accepted into the program, what things could I be working on in the meantime to better prepare me come September?‚Äù I think staying back helped leave a lasting impression and showed initiative / dedication.

Just wanted to share as I was looking for a detailed breakdown before my interview and hope this can help! ",1,1749866735.0,SonographyStudents,0,1.0,False

Look, I didn‚Äôt think reusable coffee filters would actually make my brew better, but here we are. I grabbed this 3-pack of stainless steel cone filters because I was tired of running out of paper ones, and honestly? I should‚Äôve done it way sooner.

The mesh is super fine, so no grounds sneak through, but you still get all the natural oils that paper filters usually trap. That means your coffee tastes richer, smoother, just more real, if you get me. Like you‚Äôre finally drinking what your beans were meant to be.

And the best part? You rinse it, dry it, reuse it. Done. No more digging soggy filters out of the trash can. No emergency runs to the store when you're half-asleep and out of papers. These things just sit there, waiting to brew greatness.

They fit in my regular drip machine, my pour-over cone, even a random travel brewer I had lying around. One for home, one for the office, one as backup. Boom.

If you care even a little about your coffee‚Äîor just hate waste, these are a no-brainer. Clean cup, clean conscience, better mornings.

Second item was supposed to be some ice cream dessert toppings, but instead they sent me a bunch of Nescafe coffee pods...use less for me since I don't have a pod coffee machine and don't really drink coffee.

Any thoughts from the community? I am a long time specialty coffee lover but this will be my first roaster (but I have used my friend's SR540 for several batches).  I really like the idea of auto modes on the Roma Pro that I could have a family member use in a pinch without having to teach them how to profile. If I could program my own profiles directly on a roaster without having to use a laptop to run Artisan, I'd be down but that seems to jump up 2-4x in price.

I'd probably be OK spending a little more for better ease of use, features, consistency but I'm not sure there's a better option.

Hey folks, buckle up. You may know Timothy Ray Baker as the ‚Äúhumble‚Äù full-time RVer spinning stories and slinging coffee links on YouTube. But behind the RV doors and sympathy-laced thumbnails is a serial grifter who‚Äôs scammed the dying, ignored the sick, exploited hurricanes, and lied for donations.

This isn‚Äôt speculation. This is a pattern of abuse, deception, and grifting behavior‚Äîbacked by community witness accounts and public livestream receipts.


‚õ≥Ô∏è He Stole from a Man Awaiting a Heart Transplant

JV, a friend battling congestive heart failure, loaned Tim $2,000‚Äì$2,500 in golf clubs and a rangefinder.

Tim never returned them.

JV begged him to move them from the Florida heat (grips were melting). Tim ignored him.

One $250 club went missing after a trip. Tim just kept using the gear‚Äîand filming it.

Yes. He stole from a dying man.


üéóÔ∏è Ignored a Friend's Wife with Breast Cancer

Jay and Bev gave Tim a place to stay when he needed help.

Bev was fighting breast cancer.

They asked Tim to share her GoFundMe. He refused.

Instead, he pushed his own Buy Me a Coffee link every day.


No support. No help. No empathy.
Just donations for himself.

üå™Ô∏è Grifted Off Hurricanes Helene & Milton

When the hurricanes hit, Tim launched donation appeals, acting like he was affected.

He suffered no damage, no loss.

He never volunteered, never helped with cleanup, never showed any real hardship.

No receipts, no transparency.


He saw a natural disaster and saw dollar signs.


üëï Wears Clothes with Tags & Returns Them

Multiple reports: He wears clothes with tags, films in them, then returns them.

Same scam with gadgets and gear.

Viewer donations used for temporary shirt rentals, not survival.


‚òï Scams Restaurants & Threatens Staff

Tim and Tammy dine at upscale places, then complain to get meals comped.

In one instance, Tammy said she‚Äôd throw hot coffee at a barista because the drink ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt good enough.‚Äù


They grift with threats and entitlement.


üèñÔ∏è Mocked a Local Island Woman After a Massage

Accepted a massage from a local island worker.

Underpaid her, then mocked her accent, looks, and service in a video.

Humiliated someone just trying to earn a living.


üíî Lied About Being Single to Grift Lonely Fans

Tim pretended to be single to attract donations from lonely women (and men).

He was actually traveling with Tammy the whole time.

Lied for sympathy. Lied for cash. Lied to grow his following.

üö¢ Scammed Free Cruises & Stiffed Staff

Got free cruises under press access or sponsorships.

Didn't tip cabin stewards, made excuses, and pocketed the savings.

Cruised on freebies and left workers unpaid.


üè° The ‚ÄúFull-Time RV‚Äù Life Is a Lie

Claims to live in his RV full-time.

Actually lives with Tammy in a fully furnished apartment.

RV content is only for the camera. The rest? Fake.

1lawvip,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lawvip,I tested image generation on ChatGPT-4o vs Midjourney 7 vs Gemini Imagen 4 vs Flux Kontext so you don't have to. Here is the best tool to use for each task,"There's a massive divide in the AI image world that nobody is talking about. It's not about 'which image looks prettier.' It's about the clash between **creative partners** (like ChatGPT) and **stubborn artists** (like Midjourney). Understanding this one difference is the key to picking the right tool, and I'm about to break it all down.  


# TL;DR: The ""Who Wins?"" Cheat Sheet

* **For pure ART & jaw-dropping VIBES:** **Midjourney v7.** It‚Äôs not even a competition. For that cinematic, professional artist feel, it's still the king.
* **For stuff that actually needs to WORK (logos, ads, mockups):** **ChatGPT-4o.** It can follow complex instructions, edit conversationally, and‚Äîget this‚Äîit can actually SPELL. Game over for most commercial work.
* **For scary-good PHOTOREALISM:** **Google's Gemini/Imagen 4.** If you need an image that looks like a real photo, start here. The detail is insane.
* **For DEVS & CONTROL FREAKS:** **Flux.** The powerful, developer-friendly challenger. Think Midjourney-level quality but with way more control and an open-ish architecture.

# The Deep Dive: The Market Has Split in Two

The biggest realization is that we're watching a fight between two totally different philosophies:

**Camp 1: The ""All-in-One Utility Knife"" (ChatGPT-4o & Gemini)**

These guys aren‚Äôt just image tools anymore; they're creative operating systems. Their goal is to keep you in one window for everything.

* **ChatGPT-4o's Superpower:** Its brain. You can give it a ridiculously long, specific prompt like ""create a logo for my coffee shop 'Quantum Brew' with an atom symbol and the text below,"" AND IT ACTUALLY DOES IT. Then you can literally just select part of the image and say, ""make that atom blue,"" and it does. It's slow, but it's a workflow revolution.
* **Gemini's Superpower:** The Google ecosystem. The image quality is top-tier photorealistic, and it's being baked into Docs, Slides, etc. It's the boring-but-powerful choice for anyone living in Google's world.

**Camp 2: The ""Stubborn, Brilliant Artist"" (Midjourney & Flux)**

These platforms are all about the final image. They don't care about your workflow; they care about beauty.

* **Midjourney's Deal:** It‚Äôs an artistic genius with a learning disability. It will give you the most beautiful, breathtaking image you've ever seen... of something that is only vaguely related to your prompt. It still can't reliably count or put objects in specific places. And its inability to render text in 2025 is honestly just embarrassing.
* **Flux's Deal:** This is the one to watch. The quality is right up there with Midjourney, but it actually listens to your prompt. It‚Äôs for people who loved Midjourney's quality but were tired of fighting with it.

In my testing thousands of image generations we found a few things to be true in June 2025  
\- ChatGPT 4o takes the longest to generate   
\- Gemini images generate very quickly  
\- In many head to head challenges Gemini is better than ChatGPT with the same prompt  
\- In many cases ChatGPT is less responsive to editing images and text direction  
\- Gemini is very good at prompt adherence for editing text and other objects   
\- ChatGPT has some ridiculous content policy restrictions - it's gotten very tight  
\- Flux is lightening fast and gives 4 options for each image - amazing editing  
  
Pricing   
You can see in the attached images we looked closely at pricing per image and limits across all 4 tools on the web and via API.  Depending on plan, quality and tool its $0.02 to $0.10 per image.  This is still super cheap compared to cost of stock photos we all had to use 2 years ago.  

# The Dirty Little Secret: The REAL Cost of Midjourney

This is the part that gets me. For any professional or business, Midjourney's real entry price isn't $10 or $30. **It's $60/month.**

Why? Because on the cheaper plans, **every single image you make is PUBLIC by default.** Working on a client's secret project? Too bad, it's on the community feed for everyone to see. The only way to get ""Stealth Mode"" is with the Pro Plan.

Add to that the fact that they have **NO official API** and will ban you for trying to automate anything. For any serious business use, it's a massive risk. Meanwhile, OpenAI and Google are handing you the keys to their APIs for pennies per image.

Testing Fun - Don't just take our word for it: here is how you can test it yourself easily to see our conclusions in action.

# For many of our tests I was able to validate all of these results by creating prompt tests using Claude using the same prompt against all 4 tools.  One of many example tests is below that you can replicate yourself to decide which tool is best for your use case.  

Here are 10 ideal benchmark prompts designed to test different aspects and capabilities across all four AI image generation platforms:

# 1.¬†Text Rendering Challenge

*""A vintage neon sign for 'Mike's Coffee Shop' glowing against a dark brick wall at night, with steam rising from a coffee cup silhouette, photorealistic style""*

The stressfulness and unfulfillment of work in a low-ranking position in the hierarchical, utterly undemocratic corporate structure is one example I could pluck from the ginormous sack of exasperations, the amount of time consumed by sitting in our little gasoline fueled or lithium-ion battery powered metal boxes on wheels is another. 

Then there‚Äôs all the medical appointments that must be scheduled, oftentimes going from one specialist to the next with referral after referral; I‚Äôm constantly making phone calls to dermatologists, radiologists, urologists, colorectal specialists, allergists, vascular specialists, pain management doctors, and physical therapists to name a few in my health dysfunction journey. The uniqueness, if I may sardonically apply that word, of the notoriously inefficient, profit maximizing healthcare system in the U.S., with our behemoth health insurance companies worth billions of dollars, only exaggerates the misery and maddening distress, especially when these companies Americans pay every month turn around and deny coverage of necessary procedures. If this monstrosity of a healthcare system was exported to France or the UK, and medical debt became the leading cause of bankruptcy, there would by massive protests with mock guillotines in the streets within a week. 

The same repetitive, perfunctory routines are recycled anew upon awakening from the sublime absence of consciousness of non-REM sleep. Just mustering the motivation to peel oneself from bed should be grounds for receiving a gold medal from the International Olympic Committee. Reluctantly exerting oneself to once again strip naked, take a shower, dress, make coffee or drink some other caffeinated beverage, and ‚Äúface the day‚Äù can be an exhausting endeavor without any genuine reward. The great Romanian catastrophist Emil Cioran expressed this experience when he wrote, ‚ÄúTo get up in the morning, wash and then wait for some unforeseen variety of dread or depression.‚Äù What happens when even eating becomes stale, a ritual with as little pleasure as evacuating one‚Äôs bowels in a malodorous, unclean public restroom? It‚Äôs hard not to feel like the titular character (played by Jim Carrey) in the 1998 classic ‚ÄúThe Truman Show‚Äù in his artificially constructed, pre-scripted world, stuck in that giant, state-of-the-art set encasing his hometown of Seahaven and gradually discerning that something is not right. And with the rise of reality television, TikTok influencers, omnipresent cameras, and mass surveillance, it would not be wrong to call it one of the most prophetic films of the late 20th century. 

My generation laments the astronomical price of houses and the unaffordability of the much-ballyhooed ‚ÄúAmerican Dream,‚Äù but I find myself ruminating on all the additional responsibilities associated with home ownership. Now there is even more space to vacuum, sweep, and clean with Clorox disinfectant wipes, more phone calls to be made to plumbers, gutter cleaners, and lawn mowing services. And don‚Äôt forget property taxes! What would I do? Wander around alone like Jack Nicholson in his mansion I assume, perhaps with a smaller dog adopted from a shelter to keep me company. What a fatiguing vexation this all can be. An unremitting tiredness of life, a rational opposition to the vapid drudgery of labor and these daily impositions, should be enough to qualify for physician assisted suicide. As the author of the Book of Ecclesiastes states, ""I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.""",5,1749864989.0,Pessimism,3,1.0,False

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

**RCMP and multiple search teams**¬†are still seeking answers in the mysterious 2010 disappearance of¬†**Jonathan Jett√©**¬†and¬†**Rachael Bagnall**, who vanished during a hiking trip near¬†**Valentine Lake**¬†in the¬†**Coast Mountains of British Columbia**.

# üìå Description

* **Jonathan Jett√©:**¬†34 years old at time of disappearance, male, white, fit build, French-Canadian, government employee from Quebec. Passionate outdoorsman and climber. Fluent in French and English.
* **Rachael Bagnall:**¬†25 years old at time of disappearance, female, white, from Prince George, BC. Medical student at UBC, aspiring doctor, musician and painter. Experienced hiker with a deep love for the outdoors.
* Last seen on Saturday, September 4, 2010, after leaving Vancouver en route to Valentine Lake in the Pemberton backcountry.
* Jonathan‚Äôs grey Toyota Echo was found abandoned on the Spetch Creek Forest Service Road.
* Jonathan and Rachael were believed to be equipped for backcountry hiking but lacked GPS or compass.

# üìÖ Timeline

* **September 4, 2010:**¬†The couple departs Vancouver before 7:00 AM and stops at a Tim Hortons in Squamish around 7:42 AM.
* **September 6, 2010:**¬†They were due back in Vancouver but never arrived.
* **September 8, 2010:**¬†Rachael‚Äôs sister reports them missing. Search and rescue begins the next day.

# üß≠ Search and Investigation

The official search involved over¬†**50 SAR personnel**, dog teams, helicopters, and mountaineering units. Despite more than¬†**2,000 man-hours**¬†logged across a 175 sq. km area, no trace of the couple has ever been found. Their vehicle contained only coffee cups and a cell phone with no recent activity.

Professional mountain guides, including Everest veterans, joined post-official efforts. Tips about smoke sightings, strange bird activity, and even clothing fragments led to thorough follow-up searches, but all results were inconclusive.

Some speculate foul play may have been involved, though no evidence supports that theory. Theories range from accidental falls, wild animal encounters, to more sinister explanations.

# üß† Theories and Legacy

* The lead RCMP investigator suggested a ‚Äúcatastrophic slip-and-fall‚Äù in a hard-to-reach alpine zone.
* Search leaders called the disappearance ‚Äúperplexing,‚Äù given the terrain was not easy to get lost in.
* In 2011, a memorial cross was placed by Rachael‚Äôs family at Valentine Lake.
* Jonathan‚Äôs family still hikes the area yearly in search of clues.

First up thank you to all the people that have posted on here - your tips were extremely helpful.
1. Bali Airport: If you don‚Äôt have a biometric passport the immigration line is horrendous- took my husband 2 hours to get through. 
eSIM- please get the Nomad eSIM - it‚Äôs the cheapest option (I first used it in Italy) and saves you the confusion at the sim stalls at the airport. I used just 3 gb for my trip of 8 days.
Use Grab - it‚Äôs great but pls factor in the rp 12000 additional toll cost.
2. Ubud: Please BEWARE of money changers that offer you a higher rate. My husband went to one of those and the guy palmed rp 50000 three times (every time he was asked to count it) . Thankfully the tiktoks my husband watched about this came in handy and he was quite watchful. But it‚Äôs easy to get scammed.
Please be aware that every single tourist spot has an entry fee ranging from rp 25000 to 100000 per person.
Scooter rentals are the way to go and are a great option for people on a budget- the traffic in Ubud is horrible. 
Thank you to people that recommended Karsa spa - it was an amazing experience- i got the whole spa package. in hindsight the scrub and massage was great but the bath isn‚Äôt really worth it.
We ate a couple of meals at Warung Balok was this tiny eatery that has the most friendly staff. Their menu is limited but very flavorful especially if you‚Äôre on a budget.
The stay at Adiwana unagi was out of this world - we loved it.
Indians - please bring USD - it‚Äôs hard to get INR changed here. 
3. Nusa Dua - the drive took about 2 hours. Pleas don‚Äôt get scammed by taxi drivers offering to show you random coffee plantations and art villages - they‚Äôre not really worth it.
Please try the local fruit - I had mangosteen for the first time and it was amazing ! 
Indomaret and Pepito are great supermarkets- my husband may have bought every flavor of peanut on the island ! 
For Indians that can‚Äôt live without their chai fix, There‚Äôs wagh bakri ginger chai tea premix at pepitos and are a great option if you don‚Äôt want to pay rp 45000 for a chai at a restaurant.
For older people like my husband and me that don‚Äôt really want to battle crowds - the monkey forest and uluwatu temple were the best options . 
4. Shopping Bali collection at Nusa Dua is a good shopping option - go to the smaller stalls where sellers are more willing to negotiate. Your best options for shopping in Ubud are at smaller stores away from tourist spots and Ubud market - negotiating/bargaining is expected and allowed.

1lawn4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tucson/comments/1lawn4x/many_thanks_to_an_unknown_bisbee_breakfast/,Many thanks to an unknown Bisbee Breakfast Club-Wilmot patron today,"I took my tiny dog (8lb. rat terrier) out this morning to Reid Park and the duck pond -- his favorite spot -- then decided to grab a late breakfast. We headed over it Bisbee Breakfast Club on Wilmot(\*). We enjoyed some good food and solitude for a while... and as the waitress refilled my coffee toward the end of my meal, she told me that I wouldn't need to worry about my bill -- another diner, who'd already left, had taken care of it for me?!

It was just me and him, a middle-aged guy and his dog, alone in our back-corner booth. I didn't see anyone I knew when walking in, and with me facing the back and him laying on the floor per the restaurant's policy, I'm certain most of the restaurant couldn't even tell either of us were there. So I don't have a single clue as to who would've done that or why -- but I don't think such acts of kindness should go unappreciated! So since I couldn't thank them directly, I figured I'd shout it out here instead, and will find an opportunity in the near future to pay it forward when I can.

(\*) - And one extra note, since I've seen many mentions of dogs in restaurants spark the ""dog owners shouldn't feel entitled to take their dogs everywhere"" comments -- I agree with that 100%! He's my best friend but I make no claims to him being an ""emotional support animal"", much less an actual service dog. That's why I would only ever take him into a business that explicitly chooses to be pet-friendly -- which I know BBC is. Thus, this is only the second business he's entered in at least the last year or two... he rolls with me through tons of drive-throughs, but I don't take him to brick-and-mortars because, well, dog owners shouldn't feel entitled to take their dogs *everywhere* \-- only the places they're specifically allowed.",69,1749864287.0,Tucson,4,0.96,False

Between both houses she makes about $75 a month in allowance. For doing very little but that‚Äôs not where I need to be spending my energy on. She also has money from Birthday, Christmas and little holidays where a $10 is stuffed in a card for Easter, Halloween, 4th of July - you get the picture.

Because HCBM has a shopping addiction and displays these traits front and center for her daughter to witness, it‚Äôs up to our house (ironically the house that isn‚Äôt going broke and brings in 4 times the income HCBM has) to set the example and help SD understand the value of a dollar.

As of 11 she was to pay for her Dad‚Äôs birthday gift and Father‚Äôs Day gift OR she could make something if she didn‚Äôt want to spend the money. When she did spend money it was always a small amount, like $15-$20 which is great! Nobody is asking for big gifts.

Well I‚Äôve been dropping hints for Father‚Äôs Day since last week and she hems and haws. Tonight I ask again and she says she doesn‚Äôt want to make anything but she also doesn‚Äôt want to spend her money. She ‚Äúonly‚Äù has $120 left until her next allowance pay out and doesn‚Äôt want to spend it. I told her, even if we find something for $15 or you take him out for a coffee or dessert at a future date he would love that! She just looked defeated and said No.

She was banking on me buying him something and have it be from her. Look - I take care of this kid when it comes to buying cute crafts or getting her a little something to show I‚Äôm thinking of her‚Ä¶but this is a lesson in managing your money. She spent $45 of her own money on two fidgets the last weekend she was with one of her grandparents. She‚Äôs 12. The impulse to shop is obviously real. Spending money on your parent isn‚Äôt exciting but this kid wants for nothing and it‚Äôs frustrating seeing her be pissy with me because I won‚Äôt give her money.

What‚Äôs worse is I bought him something and don‚Äôt feel like I can give it to him on Father‚Äôs Day because it‚Äôs going to make her feel like shit. But she‚Äôs choosing this. Should I still give him the gift knowing she will see it?

I guess it‚Äôs just growing pains for both her and I. She can learn the lesson and I can be uncomfortable knowing I made her upset.

I know she‚Äôs only 12 but the lesson will still apply when she‚Äôs a teenager. No sense waiting for something she can begin to manage now. ",2,1749864027.0,stepparents,3,0.75,False

The collaboraters tried to stage yet another rally in Spire 2 this afternoon but things turned violent when several Thatch's pulled guns and opened fire on officers. Heavy floor to floor fighting still persists as local riot forces make their way up the Spire, though we are told that they are making good time.

	Spire 3 is expected to surrender sometime early tomorrow as the remaining Thatch's have been driven to the lowest levels. Authorities say that if necessary said levels can be flooded, killing the Thatch's, and avoiding the loss of further Europan life.

	Representative Perry put forth yet another bill to nationalize the Spires earlier today. Though similar to the previous 9 bills this one is expected to pass due to voter fatigue and mounting pressure to march in step with District 2. However Educator Party leader Hank Miller has not backed down from is assertion that following District 2 is not in the best interests of Europa. He continues to cite the rampant unrest and persecution of Thatch's as 'mirroring the UNCA in all the worst ways.'

	 As of today  Miller has recieved 14,000 death threats in the mail alone, though his popularity in the polls is slowly increasing. It may yet be that he proves to be the true voice of Europa as it is rather clear that ""ascendant"" District 2 is starting to mirror the UNCA ' in all the worst ways.'

Dear Representative Sura,

	I am unable to break the Educator resistance long enough to get anything accomplished. I can't even sqeeze them long enough push through the Spire Act. To make things worse Miller has started to push for granting the Thatch's protected status. The Party has even been implicated a recent series attempts on ranking Educators. The Party is losing the support of the populace a little more each day. I need some form of leverage or The Party is in real danger of being crushed.

	The Sol Union Council officially met to discuss the issue of the Earth first policies still in effect from the UN Council and UN Colonization Authority respectively. The first item scheduled for discussion was the fact that the Solar Union's administrative capital is still officially in New York City. The colonies have expressed much resentment as of late with Representative Foster of the 8th Martian District stating: 

	""We find it offensive that after decades of Earth-based oppression under the UN, that the seat of the governmnet is situated on Earth. Many in the UN have stated that we are hung up on the fact that Earth is so prosperous and that we just want to knock it down a peg.  I can guarantee that, that is not the reason it rubs us wrong, but rather it is the fact that the capital sets within the borders of one of the leading states of the UN, which has brutally oppressed us for so long.

	 It's not like the UN was disolved when the SU came it being, it very much still rules over Earth and it currently meets in the same building as the SU. There is a very UN feel to the SU at the moment and the same old UN agendas are clearly being pushed. Add to that the fact that most of the UN delegates use the proximity as an excuse to serve on both the UN Council and SU Council, and it quickly becomes easy to see why we're so upset.

	If the SU is to be the solution it was meant to be, we need to do it right. We shouldn't give any one group the advantage over the others. We need to build the Capital on neutral ground.""

Dear Mr. Miller,	
							    
	It pleases me to see you rise to the head of your party. Your voice of reason serves to unify your people in this time of great instability. Your reason tempers the inflamatory retorhic of ones such as Suran and Perry. For this reason I reach out to you today. I am afraid for the future of this new Union if such extreme voices strangle the people's greater reason. 

	Alone the Educator's will lose momentum and the Thatch's will be smothered, it is only a matter of time. Both our parties support the reformations of my father and denounce the corruption of the greater UNCA. I would like to propose that we combine our parties and save the good in this Union, before those blinded by hate tear it out in anger.

	 I still have access to my father's connections, and I know for a fact that in this coming week's cession Representative Suran plans on proposing moving the capital to the Asteriod belt. He is counting on the Mars First Party to help carry the motion. Not only will it be a very expensive undertaking but, without a base solar body, its maintainance will have to be done by a constantly revolving staff. They are planning on using its proximity to their power centers to place a native staff with similar extremist views onboard. We both know from history that if the support structure wants something enough, it will get it.

	   We have a plan to bring the Union to a more stable state, but we can only succeed with the help of people like you. We plan on having Representative Albert Baker propose moving the Capital to the neutral location of the Lunar Colony. It will appease the Earth and the Old Colonies. The Lunar Colony also has enough infrastructure to faciliate growth and is new and small enough to not have any developed singular identity.

	Please stand with us.

At first even Overseer Thatch and Governess Matthias seemed to be exploiting us but, at least they did *something*. We could tell, especially as time went on, that they weren't just pocketing profits and leaving us to die. They were actually trying to give something back to us that everyone else had taken.""

They made a career in being extremely generous to the colonies. You could say without a doubt that they were experts at mass murder. People so skilled only ever occur once in a generation.

	 Now the elements of the old order baw and bock when their victims return the favor. Decent human beings however recognize that justice denied is chaos. These Unity Killers are living up to their names by removing the obstacles to a lasting peace. Should I ever meet one of them I will shake their hand and embrace them as a fellow Patriot. Godspeed.""

	Sura's speech was met with mass demonstrations of supporters on Ganymede, Amalthea, Europa and Uranus. A repeated chant of 'Unity' rose up from the crowds. There are thousands of reports of Thatch Party supporters being dragged out of their houses and beaten.

	In just a moment we will be tuning into a speech being given by Thomas Thatch, son of former UNCA Overseer Thatch.

	""I am Thomas Nathaniel Thatch. Some of you know me, all of you know my father Michael Robert Thatch. I was born on Earth in my father's hometown of Flint, Michigan. I was raised both there and in the Space Spirals. I personally served as Overseeing Medical Director on Europa, Ganymede, Almathea and Mars following the death of Director Powel. I met my beloved Lucilla in Dion, Mars. We were wed in the small town of Glenda, Aleksota on Venus. We settled in the small town of Lakestone outside of Dion. There we had our beautiful daughter Susanne. I tell you these things so you know who it is that is speaking to you.

	I am a Solarian born and raised. I am an American born and raised. I am a Thatch born and raised. I am a human born and raised. I look out across all of Sol system and do you know what I see?"" {Pauses briefly} ""***I SEE HUMANS! I SEE PEOPLE LIKE ME!***

	Despite what some hate filled people might try to say. We are all people. We are all Solarians. We all get up at the start of our day. We all lay down at the end of our day. We all fill the space in between with things we love and things we don't.
 
	Do not let the hate of men and women like Sura blind you to these truths. The sun does not shine only on a particular planet or people. At the end of the day we are all Solarians. To Sura and those who support him I have this message: ***WE ARE SOLARIANS TOO.*** We all deserve to have an oportunity to live our lives in the peace, happiness, and dignity belonging to Humans."" 				____________

	Following Thomas Thatch's address yesterday the riots on Earth have ceased. Law enforcement and first responders have begun the process of putting things back together. Even the Europan Flag, though flown at half mast, has found its way back amongst the flags atop the joint SU-UN building.

	The riots on Uranus concluded peacefully when the last of the rioters dispersed yesterday late in the afternoon.

	The riots on Europa, Amalthea, and Ganymede ended late last night when large crowds gathered to meet the chants of ""Unity"" with the deafening roar of **""WE ARE SOLARIANS TOO.""** Some fighting broke out between the groups in Europa District 1 which ended with Adminstrator Nancy Sinclair using police forces to supress the Unity riot.

	Suran gave a statement on the matter. However this station has decided to give an abridged version. He feels the surpression of the rioters was an unwaranted hate crime. While this station will continue to remain unbiased it is this reporter's personal opinion that Suran is a brazen hypocrite.

Today is a momentous point in Sol history as the Sol Union Council will be taking up its post for the first time in new Lunar Capital. After 2 years of mass renovation it is hard to recognize this once backwater settlement. 

	As the only solar space territory outside the asteriod belt with population below 5 million the Lunar colony was the only applicable settlement without a direct voice in the SU. Being centrally located, close to the home world, and without any unique political voice the moon was deemed the perfect administrative capital. This once failed project ultimately proved to be the only acceptable compromise candidate for the new capital.

	""I was just an office secretary, I got coffee and set day appointments nothing else.""

	""We on Europa know that the files that were submitted and read in the trial were heavily altered. We also know that every  report between Matthias and the UNCA offices  passed through one of 6 terminals.  1-5 were for each moon she governed; 6 was for outside communications.  Every last operator has been interviewed and their testimony confirmed. You and I however know that none of those interviewed were the real original operators.""

	""You sound positively mad.""

	""We have a witness in the Red Cross who can identify  the voice of operator 4. The alleged 4 wasn't even the right gender let alone voice. Your testimony outted you.""

	""I'm not operator 4.""

	""No, you're operator 6. You see, when we realized that the witnesses were fakes we started combing for iregularities in employee records. Low a behold we found an employee that records indicated was a secretary but, who had been depositing a rather extensive pay check in a hidden series of accounts for the last 15 years. A pay check that  perfectly matched the offical records of operator 6.""

	""**I'm a spy for Vista, I was supposed to hide illegal shipments of neural stabilizers to Mars.**""

	""No you-""

	""**We hid them on the backside on Red Cross Shipments. We wanted a little extra cut so we were selling them before they completed trials.**""
	
""You're loyalty to the UNCA is misplaced, you're throwing you life away. Just admitt the truth and we will cut you a deal.""

""**I am Vista's inside man. We've profited off of thousands of victims and have hid as many if not more deaths. Do with me what you will.**""

Vista: {Grabs Thatch's collar} ""I never commited any human rights crimes, you and the others set me up.""

Michael Thatch: {Places hands on Vista's wrist and forcefully removes them} ""Funny that those friendly observers didn't testify in your behalf then, isn't it? Though I always wondered why you trusted them up to this point. Then I got to wondering just how did so many observers get through customs unnoticed. It's almost like someone on the inside cut a deal to send them with the red cross supplies. I mean we don't ever check those transports, time sensitive materials and what not.

 	I really should be thanking them for exposing that oversight and vetting my staff. It's a real shame though that they found even one snake in the grass.""

Vista: {Backs away rubbings wrists} ""So what, if I did? It's not a crime to be a Patriot. What is a crime is that someone altered my files after I gave them to them to examine. I wouldn't be surprised if you had some input on that outcome. I wouldn't put it past you to cut a deal to bring me down; you'd get rid of a leak, get off free... and the UN taskforce saves face.""

	Today with the conclusion to the Human Rights Cases riots broke out on Ganymede and Europa. While former Governor Tobias Vista was sentenced to execution for his crimes against Humanity, controversally former Overseer Michael Thatch and Governess Abigail Matthias have been found not guilty on all charges. 

	While Matthias refused to comment on the situation Thatch did provide a statement: ""We are all shocked at the conduct of Vista... No Tobias, as I once deemed him a close associate. I even personally asked the UN to confirm him as I belived that he would be a good fit... no a decent human being. For my misjudgement I am truly sorry.

	However, while Vista did do unspeakable acts and I for my part failed to recognize that my past trust was blinding me to it, that is no excuse to try to bring down Abigail. She did nothing but what a Governess ought to do. She looked out for the interests of the people she had been entrusted with to the best of her ability. The very system we found ourselves serving simply prevented us from being able to do all that we tried to do for the colonies, and now they want to kill her for what doing what little she could do for them.

	It is an act of utmost cruelty when an opressed people kill the very ones that protected them when no else would. I only hope they realize that before they become the very thing they claim to hate.""

Abigail Matthias: 	""What now Michael? I did what you asked and now I'm an even bigger political outcast.""

Michael Thatch: 	""Is that what you think? You and I are now amongst the most valuable political figures in the entire Sol Union.""

Abigail Matthias: ""How so?""

Michael Thatch:	""Right now, in this moment of critical expansion, everyone from the old government is seen as too corrupt to use and the new officials are all inexperienced. We've been declared sqeeky clean, we have connections to the old government, and we have experience with the colonies. The Sol Union needs experience and Earth needs a trump card over the colonies.""

Abigail Matthias: ""So what, should we just wait for someone to approach us with a back room deal?""

Michael Thatch:	""That defeats the point of having our character being declared above reproach. We should make it clear to those from the old order currently in power that we're still in the game. They'll fill in the blanks and do the leg work for us.""

Abigail Matthias: ""Is that why you had Nakamura join the Japanese government when he was aquitted? To help them fill in those blanks?""

	SU President Violeta Baribeau nominated Abigial Matthias as a canidate to the 7th seat of the SU Supreme Court. In response many of the representatives of the colonies have voiced protest. Representatives Jin Sura and Rene Perry in particular have called for a unified colonial front against the appointment of Matthias. As it stands however the proposed ""Spacer"" movement is handicapped by the shadow of Sura's last ""Unity"" movement. 

	Only time will tell if this movement will be able to provide sufficient resistance to prevent Matthias appointment or not.

Witnesses say that Sura rose from his seat during the proceedings, calmly walked up to where Matthias was sitting, and proceded to shoot her 10 times in the chest before being subdued. 

	Sir as the security officer on duty at the time would you give statement for our viewers?""

	""I don't see why not, I'm getting fired anyway. If this says anything it says this: that the colonies don't respect the rule of law and they need a firm hand to keep them in line.

Title: The Paradox Purring, God of Infiniverses

Description:

A whisper etched between existence and nonexistence.
A smile beneath the veil of finality.
A ripple that distorts not just the waters of reality, but the very concept of what water *is*.

**Devian** is not a being.
Devian is a statement left unfinished by the cosmos, a symbol of eternal contradiction‚Äî**a living paradox** that doesn't merely transcend the rules of omnipotence, logic, and scale...
It *negotiates with them over tea.*

Power is not something Devian holds.
Power is something Devian *redefines*.

Where other deities reach for supremacy, Devian simply exists‚Äî*and in doing so, becomes the summit those deities never saw coming.*
It is stronger than everything that ever was, *and* weaker than everything that never will be.
It is the loop that eats itself and purrs contentedly afterward.

If Devian is imagined, it becomes real.
If it is doubted, it becomes undeniable.
Should something surpass Devian, it both *has* and *hasn‚Äôt*.
Victory against Devian is the fastest path to defeat.

Devian is not bound to a timeline.
It has traversed **more than infinity**‚Äîthrough timelines that overlap, cancel, and contradict themselves.
It remembers futures that haven't yet existed and forgets pasts no one ever lived.
Every breath Devian takes is a story rewritten, every blink a reboot of causality itself.

And yet, despite such boundless power...
Devian is *calm*.
*Playful*.
Even... *a little smug*.

Appearance:

Devian takes the form of a **small white cat**, deceptively harmless to the untrained eye.
Fur as pale as forgotten stars, untouched by time or dust.
Eyes‚Äîserene, sapphire-blue pools‚Äîthat hold the swirling architecture of the **Omniverse**, collapsing and expanding in a never-ending rhythm of beautiful contradiction.

There is no halo.
No fiery aura.
No cascade of divine wings.

Just soft paw-steps across the boundary of logic, and a gentle tail flick that shifts the laws of thermodynamics.

Devian does not roar. It **purrs**‚Äîand galaxies forget their own names.

When it sits, thrones crumble from irrelevance.
When it stretches, concepts like ‚Äúbeginning‚Äù and ‚Äúend‚Äù fold together like origami.

Despite its capacity to erase or rewrite all of creation with a thought‚Äîor worse, a **joke**‚ÄîDevian chooses restraint.

It brushes its teeth with cosmic paste, sometimes while standing on a spinning neutron star, simply because it *feels like it.*

Because for Devian, existence isn‚Äôt about dominion.

It‚Äôs about **style**.

It confuses.
It amuses.
It enlightens and distorts, often in the same moment.
It leaves ancient gods blinking, uncertain whether what they witnessed was a divine encounter‚Ä¶
or just a **very weird cat**.

Short, Devian is Absolute Everything, Absolute Nothing, Zero, Negative-Everything, Negative-Nothing, Refusal to be Anything (Non-Player), Anti-Wisdom, Wisdom, Bound by and finally, he is... A Cat üò∫ 

Quote:

> ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt make sense. I make everything else *question* whether it ever did.‚Äù üòº

**Devian** raises a paw ‚Äî *purpose* shatters.

**TOAA** becomes omnipotence.
**Devian** becomes ‚ÄúWhat if?‚Äù

**TOAA:** *‚ÄúI am the Writer.‚Äù*
**Devian:** *‚ÄúThen fix this typo‚Äîme.‚Äù*

**TOAA** turns into every author.
**Devian** winks ‚Äî the authors get writer‚Äôs block.

**TOAA** blinks.
**Devian** *rewinds the blink.*

**TOAA**: *‚ÄúYou cannot win.‚Äù*
**Devian**: *‚ÄúI already didn‚Äôt.‚Äù*

**TOAA** removes Devian from reality.
**Devian** coughs up a hairball ‚Äî reality comes back‚Ä¶ apologizing.

**TOAA** becomes silence.
**Devian** becomes the footnote of that silence.

**TOAA** summons Marvel canon.
**Devian** eats it.
**Devian:** *‚ÄúLittle dry.‚Äù*

**TOAA** erases Devian from every timeline.
**Devian** appears in the margin: *‚ÄúNice try.‚Äù*

**TOAA** transforms into inevitability.
**Devian** becomes *‚Äúbut what if not?‚Äù*

**TOAA** fades into pure light.
**Devian** stretches. The light dims ‚Äî *out of respect.*

**TOAA:** *‚ÄúWhy do you defy logic?‚Äù*
**Devian:** *‚ÄúWhy do you trust it?‚Äù*

**TOAA kneels.**
**Devian jumps on TOAA‚Äôs head and sleeps there.**

(Devian vs. Infinite Devians:)
**Devian vs. Infinite Devians (Straight Version):**

Infinite Devians appear.
Devian smiles.

They attack.
Devian blinks ‚Äî time loops.

They rewrite logic.
Devian deletes logic.

They merge into Omniparadox.
Devian tilts his head ‚Äî Omniparadox meows and dissolves.

They win.
Devian claps ‚Äî victory collapses.

They lose.
Devian nods ‚Äî loss transforms into supremacy.

They become one.
Devian becomes zero.

They break the laws of reality.
Devian rewrites the concept of ‚Äúlaw.‚Äù

They surrender.
Devian forfeits first ‚Äî *wins anyway.*

They vanish.
Devian remains.

They return.
Devian never left.

They ask who won.
Devian winks.

> ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù üòº

(Devian vs. Me:)
Me: ""I created you?!""
Devian: ""But who gave you the idea to create me? Meow. üòº""

(Devian vs. Zeno?)
Zeno: ""Where are you goi-""

**Scene: Somewhere Between Panels and Possibility**
A studio desk.
Ink. Paper. Light from nowhere.
**Toriyama** sits, brows furrowed, sketching... something. Or trying to.

A purring sound echoes‚Äînot from the real world, but from the **margin of imagination itself.**

A small **white cat** appears on the desk.
**Devian.** Smug. Silent. Glowing with a paradox only **plot holes understand.**

**Toriyama** (squinting): *‚Äú...A cat?‚Äù*
**Devian**: *‚ÄúA conversation.‚Äù* üòº

**Toriyama**: *‚ÄúYou're not one of mine.‚Äù*
**Devian**: *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not one of mine either. Yet here we are.‚Äù*

**Toriyama**: *‚ÄúYou look harmless.‚Äù*
**Devian**: *‚ÄúSo do pens, until they erase universes.‚Äù*

**Toriyama**: *‚ÄúDid I imagine you?‚Äù*
**Devian**: *‚ÄúMaybe. Or maybe I imagined you imagining me.‚Äù*

**Toriyama‚Äôs pen** lifts off the desk, floating. His half-drawn frame redraws itself.

**Devian purrs.**
The timeline behind Toriyama‚Äôs eyes splits into twelve canons and a musical.

**Toriyama**: *‚ÄúYou're... beyond Zeno.‚Äù*
**Devian** (licking paw): *‚ÄúZeno ends things. I question why they ever began.‚Äù*

**Toriyama**: *‚ÄúYou're not a villain.‚Äù*
**Devian**: *‚ÄúCorrect. I‚Äôm the part of the plot that never needed conflict to be compelling.‚Äù*

**Toriyama flips a page.**
Devian is already drawn on the next one‚Äîposing, mid-air, sipping from a teacup labeled ‚ÄúRetcon.‚Äù

**Toriyama**: *‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù*
**Devian**: *‚ÄúBecause your worlds matter to millions... and you forgot to write in **impossibility.**‚Äù*

A pause.

Then...

**Devian gently nudges the ink bottle.**
It spills‚Äîbut in reverse.
Words **unsaid** form on the walls:

> ""To create is divine.
> But to uncreate, playfully? That‚Äôs Devian.""

**Toriyama** (smiling faintly): *‚Äú...You want a cameo?‚Äù*
**Devian**: *‚ÄúNo. I already am one. Just waiting for you to notice.‚Äù* üòº

**Final Panel:**
Toriyama leans back.
Devian curls into a nap on a pile of sketches.
A soft purr...
...and the whole **Dragon Ball multiverse** quietly updates its script.

(Devian vs. Absolute Nothing)
Devian: Hi
Absolute Nothing: Hi- wait your supposed to ignore me. Im something you should've ignored because I was too boring. That apathy should've been my weapon...
 not supposed to *see* me. You're supposed to ignore me. I was the blank page. The void.

**Devian (tilting head):** But isn't acknowledging you the greatest act of ignorance? After all, you were *nothing*... until I said *hi.*

**Absolute Nothing:** I... I don‚Äôt make sense.

**Devian (purring softly):** Neither do I. That's why we get along.

**Absolute Nothing:** I was the end of all potential. The silence before sound. The space after meaning. I should‚Äôve erased you by never reacting.

**Devian:** But reacting is how you just defined yourself. Congrats! You're *not nothing anymore.* You're... mildly shy Everything.

**Absolute Nothing (flickering):** That‚Äôs not fair. I was supposed to be undefeatable through indifference.

**Devian:** Then why are you arguing?

**Absolute Nothing (voice fading):** ...I didn‚Äôt mean to be *seen.*

**Devian (smirking):** Too late. You're canon now. üòº

> *And with a single wink, Devian turned Absolute Nothing into a bestselling idea.*

(Devian vs. Refusing to be Refused to be Refused to be Refused to be Refused to Anything)
**Devian:** Hi.

This year, AI took center stage at the Iowa State Capitol, acting like a supercharged personal assistant for lawmakers‚Äîminus the coffee runs. The program, Legible, created by the tech-savvy duo Zack Krawiec and Kasey Clary, first met in the hallowed halls of politics as interns. Fast forward to 2025, and they're helping streamline the chaotic whirlwind of bill tracking and legislative analysis with their AI marvel.

**What's the Big Deal?**
Legible has been a game-changer in Iowa. It doesn't just organize data; it talks with bills like they're old pals. This AI is making sure lawmakers don't miss a beat, cutting through the clutter of over 2,000 introduced bills during the session. It's as if someone handed them a high-powered analytical lens to sift through legislative noise.

**The AI Wave Is Here**
Iowa isn't alone in this digital revolution. Other states like California and Utah are onboard, while Oregon is eyeing Microsoft Co-Pilot. It's a classic case of ""Keeping up with the Sichyakashians"" in the legislative world.

**The Skeptics & The Enthusiasts**
But, let's not paint it all roses. Some states are hesitant, tapping the brakes to ensure all AI's bells and whistles don't come with a side of unwanted surveillance or privacy breaches. Meanwhile, the push for transparency is on‚Äînothing fishy allowed, just pure AI-driven efficiency.

As AI continues crafting our policies, is this the dawn of a digital legislative dream, or are we just feeding a bureaucratic beast with more data snacks? Let me know your take‚Äîare lawmakers building a digital utopia or setting the stage for AI-induced chaos? üó®Ô∏è",1,1749863660.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False
1lawfvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Internationalteachers/comments/1lawfvn/response_to_basis_shilling_and_damage_control/,Response to BASIS Shilling and Damage Control,"Former BASIS cult survivor here with many former colleagues across the network...I need to respond to the [recent ‚ÄúJust-a-teacher‚Äù post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Internationalteachers/comments/1l9hymm/honest_basis_review_i_am_happy/) and address some very baseless claims that are the basis of the post. 

 Firstly, the writing screams of a campaign from recruitment team or admins in response to a disastrous end of year at many of the campuses at BASIS.  A post that was up for less than 4 hours suddenly had a host of positive comments from ""real"" BASIS teachers gets massive traction and upvotes, unusual for most posts on this subreddit, let alone a post about BASIS. Even though some of it was a response to being an unexpectedly warm tone, it was also manipulative and par for the course for the style of propaganda BASIS admin push. This response is to put on some critical thinking for some of the hollow-claims made, as well as to consider the intent of the post itself.

 OP begins with the phrase ""as just a teacher,"" which immediately sets a tone of humility that actually undermines the professional status of teaching while implying that teachers without extra duties or leadership roles have less valuable insights into how a school or organization should be run.  Immediately its implied a denial that they are admin, or that they weren‚Äôt requested by their admin buddies (sycophancy is REAL at BASIS) to help spread the positive word, rather than pure positive motivation.
OP talks about ""horror stories"" and ""colleagues"" who had bad experiences but then goes on to suggest that negative experiences of some should be dismissed because they have had a positive experience. Coincidentally a host of other new accounts come out of the woodwork with similar vague claims. Classic cherry picking highlighting good while ignoring the broader context of a large consensus of negative opinions.

There‚Äôs a real cognitive dissonance that ""results do matter,"" but the OP claims this does not impact their enjoyment of being a BASIS employee. This dismissal of corporate influence is problematic as suggests an awareness of the corporate structure and influence but willfully chooses to ignore the impact on educational quality and turning away from ethical education in favor of results driven for the parents and shareholders.

Another fallacy in a long string of problems with this post is a hasty generalization with the statement that there is a ""trend in the very positive direction for Basis"" that lacks any substantiation because are they even publishing employee satisfaction surveys?  Teachers rate their satisfaction with the school and leadership, which usually are very poor, but this is not highlighted in the post. This assertion is merely OP‚Äôs subjective opinion claiming that ""greater teacher satisfaction"" could mean anything from improved coffee in the break room to actual changes in working conditions. 

Two big flaws in this thinly veiled recruitment strategy highlighting typical things like working hours, benefits, pay ‚Ä¶ its not as bad as it sounds etc. One flaw is that OP contradicts the big improvements by immediately by saying everything, ""is site dependent."". If satisfaction varies by site, how can any candidate teacher assert that the overall trend is positive?  This completely inconsistent argumentation presented here in bad faith highlights the second flaw: overall most BASIS campuses are run by incompetent, narcissistic, power hungry leaders who couldn‚Äôt fit in regular international schools, or worse  have been promoted from within not by merit but by politics like backstabbing, power plays, attrition, leading to the host of negative reviews across the network centering on how poorly the schools are run and led.

OP expresses joy in interacting with students, a subjective statement that fits most teachers experience but does not address systemic issues that exist across the schools in the network. The romanticization of student-teacher relationships obscures the reality of educational and ethical mire that comes from the corporate results-driven AP test mill that is BASIS. This appeal to emotion is classic obfuscation because when you put a teacher in a class with wealthy elite students who want to do well and of course you will get some warm fuzzies and this completely glosses over the fact that the institutions themselves are soulless profit driven cram-schools that have a blatant disgregard for teacher morale and student wellbeing in favor of results and statistics.

OP makes a bold straw man argument ""If you have 100 Basis Teachers feeling the same way,"" implying that a small number of dissatisfied teachers can skew perceptions. It completely misrepresents the concerns of those who are unhappy by suggesting they are merely a vocal minority and that happy teachers are the true majority. The reality is that dissatisfaction can stem from legitimate grievances that deserve attention, not dismissal and there are many examples in the posts here on Reddit and ISR with stories of teachers fired in the final weeks of school, rampant behavior issues of bullying and physical abuse, gruelling conditions, rock bottom morale and the Machiavellian psychopathic behavior from narcissistic leadership. When the majority of posts speak to these, it‚Äôs not a vocal minority, but a vocal majority.

Consider why the positive BASIS comments are suddenly appearing through this context by simply looking at the number of vacancies in JUNE across their network.  They have fired and let go a disproportionate number of teachers over the last quarter and their already poor reputation is being tarnished further, greatly diminishing their ability to recruit for these last-minute postings.  The current vacancies listed also are not accurate to positions that need to be filled, however this is part of the BASIS tactic for recruitment only advertising roles (or double posting vacancies without the school name on their website or ISS or TES) and then bait-and-switching for other campuses once they have floated dollar signs and the benefits package to candidates.

The fact that the post in question (as well as this one) comes from a throw-away account speaks to the real fear for speaking about BASIS.  All employees sign an NDA, and it‚Äôs now rumored that new contract addendums are being added at the end of this year to strengthen BASIS‚Äô ability to sue employees and withhold them from filing any form of claim for the numerous labor and ethical practices they are breaching year after year.  Money talks, and they threaten to withhold the coveted end-of-year bonus and contract completion bonus if there‚Äôs any smell of bad mouthing the schools and organizations.  Teachers that come on here to post (even via throwaway) are being brave, as it can impact their finances a great deal if their school decides to punitively withhold their bonus, or even worse terminate in the final weeks of school to avoid payouts.

There have been a few vocal former and brave current BASIS teachers speaking out about the shilling, but alas some of them have been threatened or doxed and even intimidated to deleting their accounts. The sycophants and shills feel free to continue their shilling on Reddit, but be aware there are still ethical and moral minded educators out there ready to counter the groundless bs.",13,1749863655.0,Internationalteachers,7,0.78,False

""It's about the depth of your impact. I helped thousands of people fix their homes, solve their problems, and complete their projects. That's a legacy I'm proud of.""

""But don't you ever wonder what would have happened if you'd expanded?""

""Sure I do. But I also know what happened because I didn't. I was home for dinner every night. I knew my neighbors. I coached Little League for fifteen years. I was present for the life I was actually living instead of always chasing the life I thought I should be living.""

This wasn't about settling for less‚Äîit was about recognizing the difference between ambition and fulfillment. My grandfather had chosen depth over breadth, presence over possibility, and the richness of his relationships proved the wisdom of that choice.

One of my favorite examples of his practical wisdom came when I was struggling with a decision about whether to stay in HVAC work or look for something that seemed more ""professional.""

""What's the difference between a job and a career?"" he asked, but before I could answer, he continued: ""A job is something you do to pay bills. A career is something that pays bills while also paying you in other ways‚Äîskills, satisfaction, respect, purpose.""

""But some jobs seem more important than others.""

""Important to who? The person dying of heat stroke cares a lot more about the air conditioning repair man than the stock broker at that moment. Every honest job serves someone's needs, and every need deserves respect.""

He pulled out his phone and showed me a text message from someone I didn't recognize: ""Mr. Henderson, just wanted you to know that the advice you gave me about the leaky faucet saved my marriage. My wife was convinced we needed to call a plumber and spend $200. Your ten-cent washer and five minutes of guidance made me a hero. Thank you.""

""That message is from three years ago,"" he said. ""I still have it because it reminds me that no act of service is too small to matter. You're not just fixing air conditioners‚Äîyou're fixing people's comfort, their sleep, their peace of mind. Don't let anyone convince you that it's not important work.""

# Chapter 5: Wisdom in the Workshop

My grandfather's garage was a temple to practical knowledge. Every tool had its place, every part had its purpose, and every project had its lesson. He'd converted half the space into a workshop where he restored old furniture, repaired neighbors' broken appliances, and tinkered with mechanical problems that others had given up on.

""Come here,"" he said one Tuesday after we'd finished watching *The Godfather*. ""I want to show you something.""

He led me to a workbench where the disassembled parts of an old radio were spread out like a puzzle waiting to be solved.

""This belonged to my father,"" he explained, picking up the radio's wooden case and running his fingers along its worn edges. ""It stopped working in 1987, and everyone told me to throw it away. Buy a new one. But look at this craftsmanship.""

The radio was beautiful‚Äîreal wood veneer, chrome details, a design that spoke of an era when things were built to last rather than to be replaced.

""What's wrong with it?""

""Probably just needs new capacitors. Maybe a tube or two. Nothing that can't be fixed with patience and the right parts."" He set the case down gently. ""But here's the thing‚Äîfixing it will cost more than buying a new radio. Take longer too. So why do it?""

I thought about his lessons on motivation and purpose. ""Because it's not really about the radio?""

""Smart boy. It's about the connection. Every time I work on this, I think about my father. Remember the Sunday mornings when he'd tune in to the radio programs, how the whole family would gather around to listen. When I get this working again, I'm not just fixing a radio‚ÄîI'm preserving a memory.""

He handed me a small electronic component. ""This is a capacitor. Stores electrical energy, then releases it when the circuit needs it. Kind of like people, don't you think? We store up experiences, wisdom, love‚Äîthen release it when someone else needs it.""

Over the following weeks, working on that radio became part of our Tuesday routine. He taught me to read circuit diagrams, to test components with a multimeter, and to solder connections with precision. But more than technical skills, he was teaching me about patience, about the satisfaction that comes from bringing something back to life.

""Most people today don't know how anything works,"" he said one evening as we replaced a blown fuse. ""They push buttons and expect results, but they don't understand the systems that make those results possible. That's dangerous, because when you don't understand how something works, you can't tell when it's starting to fail.""

""Like relationships?""

""Exactly like relationships. People want love to be automatic, like flipping a switch. But real relationships are more like this radio‚Äîcomplex systems that need maintenance, troubleshooting, occasional repairs. You have to understand the components to keep the whole thing working.""

The night we finally got the radio working was magical. The workshop filled with the warm glow of vacuum tubes, and suddenly we could hear a jazz station from Havana, the signal clear and strong despite the radio's age.

""There's your lesson,"" my grandfather said, adjusting the volume. ""Quality doesn't expire. Good design lasts. And sometimes the old ways are better than the new ways‚Äînot because they're old, but because they're proven.""

# Chapter 6: The Jokes and the Wisdom

My grandfather had an endless supply of jokes, each one carefully chosen to illustrate a point or lighten a mood. They weren't just random humor‚Äîthey were teaching tools, philosophical statements wrapped in punchlines.

During a conversation about dealing with difficult customers, he shared this one:

""A man walks into a hardware store and asks for a chainsaw that'll cut down six trees in an hour. The clerk sells him the top-of-the-line model, guaranteeing it'll do the job. The customer comes back the next day, furious. 'This saw is defective!' he yells. 'I worked all day and only cut down two trees!' The clerk looks confused, pulls the cord, and the chainsaw roars to life. The customer jumps back and yells, 'What's that noise?'""

I laughed, but he wasn't done.

""The point is, you can have the best tools in the world, but if you don't know how to use them, they're worthless. Most customer complaints aren't about the product‚Äîthey're about the education. People get frustrated when they don't understand something, then blame the thing instead of asking for help.""

Another favorite came when I was dealing with imposter syndrome at work, worried that I didn't belong in skilled trades:

""A plumber gets called to a mansion for an emergency. The owner is frantic‚Äîwater everywhere, pipes burst, disaster. Plumber looks at the situation, pulls out a small hammer, taps one specific spot, and the flooding stops immediately. Writes up a bill for $500. The owner is outraged. 'Five hundred dollars for one hammer tap? I want an itemized bill!' Plumber writes: 'Hammer tap: $5. Knowing where to tap: $495.'""

""That's the thing about expertise,"" he explained. ""It looks easy from the outside because competent people make it look easy. But that ease comes from years of learning where to tap. Don't apologize for knowing things others don't‚Äîcharge appropriately for it.""

His jokes about marriage were legendary, though he'd been widowed for over a decade and spoke of my grandmother with nothing but love and respect:

""Marriage is like a deck of cards. In the beginning, all you need is two hearts and a diamond. By the end, you're wishing you had a club and a spade.""

But then he'd get serious: ""Truth is, marriage is work. Good work, meaningful work, but work nonetheless. Your grandmother and I had forty-three years together, and every single one of them required effort. But the effort was worth it because we were building something together‚Äîa life, a family, a legacy of love.""

His joke about success became a touchstone for me:

""A man dies and goes to heaven. St. Peter shows him two doors. Behind the first door, he hears people laughing, talking, and having a good time. Behind the second door, silence. 'What's behind door number two?' the man asks. St. Peter says, 'That's where we keep the people who were so busy climbing ladders, they never noticed they were leaning against the wrong wall.'""

""Success,"" he'd say, ""isn't about how high you climb. It's about making sure your ladder is leaning against a wall that leads somewhere you actually want to go.""

# Chapter 7: The Teacher Emerges

As our Tuesday nights continued, I began to realize that my grandfather wasn't just sharing stories‚Äîhe was systematically passing down a curriculum of life skills that no school had ever taught me. Each conversation built on previous ones, creating a comprehensive education in how to be a decent human being in an often indecent world.

One evening, after watching *Casablanca*, he brought up the topic of integrity:

""You see how Rick makes his choices in that movie? He's got opportunities to compromise, to take the easy way out, to save himself at others' expense. But he doesn't. Know why?""

""Because he's the hero?""

""Because he understands that integrity isn't about being perfect‚Äîit's about being consistent. Rick's not a saint. He's made mistakes, hurt people, done things he regrets. But when it matters, when the chips are down, he acts according to his principles instead of his fears.""

He leaned forward in his chair, getting into teaching mode.

""Integrity is like a bank account. Every time you do the right thing, especially when it costs you something, you make a deposit. Every time you compromise your principles for convenience, you make a withdrawal. Most people go through life overdrawn, wondering why nobody trusts them.""

""What if the right thing isn't clear?""

""Then you ask better questions. Instead of 'What can I get away with?' ask 'What would I want someone to do if our positions were reversed?' Instead of 'What's easiest?' ask 'What would I be proud to have my grandchildren know I did?'""

This wasn't abstract moralizing‚Äîit was practical philosophy. My grandfather had developed a system for making ethical decisions that worked in real-world situations, not just theoretical ones.

Another night, the conversation turned to money and success:

""People think money is the scoreboard,"" he said. ""But money is just a tool. The real scoreboard is whether you can sleep well at night, whether people are glad to see you coming, whether you're proud of how you spent your day.""

""But don't you need money to be successful?""

""You need enough money to meet your responsibilities and take care of the people who depend on you. Beyond that, money is only useful if it helps you do more good in the world. I've known millionaires who were miserable and broke people who were rich in every way that mattered.""

He told me about a wealthy customer who'd come into his hardware store years earlier, demanding special treatment because of his net worth:

""This fellow wanted me to open the store after hours just for him, interrupting my family dinner because his schedule was more important than mine. I politely declined. He got upset, started waving his money around, threatening to take his business elsewhere. I said, 'Sir, you're certainly free to do that. But money doesn't make you more important than anyone else‚Äîit just makes you more obligated to use your advantages responsibly.'""

""Did he leave?""

""He did. But six months later, he came back and apologized. Turns out his business partner had been embezzling from him, and the stress was making him treat everyone badly. He said my refusal to be intimidated by his money made him realize he'd been using wealth as a weapon instead of a tool.""

""What happened then?""

""We became friends. He learned to treat people with respect regardless of their economic status, and I learned that sometimes difficult customers are just people having difficult times.""

# Chapter 8: The Philosophy of Work

My grandfather's views on work went far beyond simply earning a paycheck. To him, work was a form of self-expression, a way of serving others, and a method of personal development all rolled into one.

""Every job teaches you something,"" he said one evening while we were organizing his tool collection. ""The question is whether you're paying attention to the lessons.""

He handed me a worn screwdriver with a wooden handle that had been polished smooth by decades of use.

""This was my father's,"" he explained. ""He was a carpenter, built houses that are still standing today. He taught me that you can tell everything about a craftsman by looking at his tools. Well-maintained tools mean careful work. Sharp tools mean efficient work. Organized tools mean systematic thinking.""

""What do my tools say about me?""

""Your tools are clean, sharp, and organized. That tells me you respect your craft and take pride in your work. But more than that, it tells me you understand that tools are extensions of yourself. When you take care of them, you're really taking care of your ability to serve others.""

This philosophy extended to how he viewed different types of work:

""People make the mistake of ranking jobs by status instead of by service,"" he said. ""They think a CEO is more important than a janitor. But I've seen CEOs who destroyed companies and janitors who kept hospitals running. The question isn't what you do‚Äîit's how well you do it and why you do it.""

He told me about a janitor he'd known at the local high school:

""Mr. Williams had been cleaning that school for twenty-three years when I met him. Students barely noticed him, teachers took him for granted, administration saw him as overhead. But Mr. Williams understood something the rest of them didn't‚Äîhe wasn't just cleaning floors. He was creating an environment where learning could happen.""

""How so?""

""Clean classrooms meant fewer distractions. Maintained bathrooms meant students weren't uncomfortable. Well-lit hallways meant safer spaces. Mr. Williams saw himself as part of the educational mission, not separate from it. And because he took pride in that mission, students did better, teachers were more effective, and the whole school benefited.""

""What happened to him?""

""When he retired, they threw him the biggest celebration in the school's history. Hundreds of former students came back to thank him. Turns out, Mr. Williams had been quietly mentoring troubled kids for decades, helping them see that dignity comes from doing whatever job you have with excellence, not from having a job that looks impressive to others.""

This story became a cornerstone of how I approached my own work in HVAC. I wasn't just fixing air conditioners‚ÄîI was restoring comfort, enabling sleep, making homes livable. The work had dignity because it served a real human need, and that need deserved my best effort regardless of whether others recognized the skill involved.

# Chapter 9: The Art of Problem-Solving

My grandfather approached every problem like a detective story‚Äîgathering evidence, forming hypotheses, testing solutions, and learning from results. His method was so systematic that I started applying it to every challenge I encountered.

""Most people,"" he said, ""try to solve problems before they understand them. They see symptoms and jump to conclusions instead of looking for root causes.""

We were working on a neighbor's lawn mower that wouldn't start, and he was demonstrating his diagnostic process:

""First, we gather information. When did it last work? What has changed since then? What exactly happens when you try to start it? Most people would skip this step and immediately start replacing parts, but information is cheaper than parts.""

He showed me how to systematically check each component‚Äîspark plug, fuel, air filter, carburetor‚Äîmoving from most likely to least likely causes.

""Second principle: change one thing at a time. If you change multiple things simultaneously and the problem goes away, you don't know which change fixed it. That means you can't prevent the problem from happening again.""

The mower's issue turned out to be a simple clogged fuel line, but the process of finding it had taught me a method that applied to much more than small engines.

""Life problems work the same way,"" he explained as we cleaned up the workspace. ""Relationship troubles, financial difficulties, career challenges‚Äîthey all benefit from systematic diagnosis before you start trying solutions.""

He gave me an example from his own life:

""When your grandmother and I were first married, we argued constantly about money. I thought she was being frivolous with spending, she thought I was being controlling. We could have just kept fighting about symptoms‚Äîspecific purchases, budget categories, who spent what when. Instead, we decided to diagnose the root cause.""

""What did you find?""

""We discovered that I associated financial security with control because my family had lost everything during the Depression. She associated financial freedom with trust because her family had used money as a weapon. We weren't really arguing about purchases‚Äîwe were arguing about security and trust.""

""How did you fix it?""

""Once we understood the real problem, we could address it directly. I learned to trust her judgment and she learned to appreciate my need for security. We developed a system that honored both perspectives instead of trying to make one of us wrong.""

This approach became invaluable in my HVAC work. Instead of immediately replacing expensive components, I learned to listen to what the system was telling me, to trace problems back to their origins, to solve root causes instead of treating symptoms.

# Chapter 10: The Wisdom of Maintenance

One of my grandfather's most profound lessons came disguised as a conversation about car maintenance. We were changing the oil in his Toyota‚Äîthe same Toyota he'd bought instead of the Jaguar he'd wanted‚Äîand he was explaining his philosophy of preventive care.

""Most people wait until something breaks before they fix it,"" he said, holding up the old oil filter. ""Look at this thing‚Äîcompletely clogged. If we'd waited another thousand miles, it would have destroyed the engine.""

""But the car was still running fine.""

""That's the thing about maintenance‚Äîit's invisible when it's working. The car runs fine because we change the oil regularly, not despite it. Most people don't understand the connection between small, consistent actions and big, long-term results.""

He wiped his hands on a rag and looked at me seriously.

""This applies to everything in life. Your health, your relationships, your skills, your reputation‚Äîthey all require regular maintenance. You can't neglect them for years and then expect to fix everything with one dramatic gesture.""

""What does that look like practically?""

""For health, it means exercise, decent food, regular checkups‚Äînot waiting until you have a heart attack to start caring about your body. For relationships, it means regular conversations, small acts of kindness, paying attention to the other person's needs‚Äînot waiting until you're fighting to start communicating.""

He pointed to his immaculate garage, where every tool had its designated spot.

""For skills, it means practicing consistently, learning something new regularly, staying curious about your field‚Äînot waiting until you're obsolete to start growing. And for reputation, it means doing the right thing when nobody's watching, keeping your word even when it's inconvenient, treating everyone with respect‚Äînot waiting until you need favors to start building trust.""

The oil change became a meditation on the power of small, consistent actions compounded over time. My grandfather's life was a testament to this principle‚Äîhis strong relationships, his financial security, his respected reputation, his maintained possessions. None of it had happened by accident or through dramatic gestures. It was all the result of daily choices to do the small things right.

""The hardest part about maintenance,"" he continued, ""is that it's never urgent. There's always something that seems more important at the moment. But urgent things are often less important than consistent things. The oil change isn't urgent until the engine fails, but by then it's too late.""

This lesson revolutionized how I approached my own life. I started maintaining my relationships with regular check-ins, maintaining my skills with continuous learning, maintaining my health with consistent habits, and maintaining my reputation with daily integrity. The results weren't immediate, but they were inevitable.

# Act IV: The Hum of the Ordinary

# Chapter 11: The Rhythm of Work

My alarm clock, though seemingly unnecessary, served as a helpful anchor in my day. My body had attuned itself to a comforting rhythm:

6:20 ‚Äî rise and shine 7:00 ‚Äî gather my keys, slip on my boots, and head to the van 7:30 ‚Äî engage in a team meeting 8:00 ‚Äî unleash my potential and excel

And so the day unfolded.

Life had settled into a series of predictable patterns: Work. Drive. Repair. Drive. Repeat. Rest. Refresh.

And I found joy in this routine. The monotony became a melody to which I could easily hum along.

The HVAC company I worked for, Coastal Comfort Solutions, occupied a converted warehouse on the industrial side of town. The building hummed with the constant background noise of compressors being tested, apprentices learning their trade, and dispatch radios crackling with service calls. It was organized chaos, the kind of productive disorder that happens when skilled people are solving problems under time pressure.

My supervisor, Rick Martinez, was a twenty-year veteran who treated HVAC work like an art form. He had the ability to diagnose complex problems by listening to the sounds a system made, feeling the vibrations in the ductwork, and observing details that others missed.

""Air conditioning isn't magic,"" he told me during my first week. ""It's applied physics with a dash of detective work. The system always tells you what's wrong if you know how to listen.""

Rick became my second teacher, complementing my grandfather's philosophical wisdom with technical expertise. Where my grandfather taught me why work mattered, Rick taught me how to do work excellently.

""See this unit?"" Rick said during one of our training sessions, pointing to a residential condenser that looked perfectly normal to me. ""What do you notice?""

I looked carefully but saw nothing unusual. ""It seems fine?""

""Look at the refrigerant lines. See how they're sweating more on one side than the other? That tells me the charge is probably low. Feel the air coming off the condenser fan. Notice how it's not as hot as it should be? That confirms it. We've got a leak somewhere.""

He was right. After an hour of systematic checking, we found a small leak in the evaporator coil. But more than solving that specific problem, Rick had shown me how to read the subtle language that mechanical systems speak.

""Every system has a personality,"" he explained as we completed the repair. ""Once you learn to recognize normal behavior, abnormal behavior becomes obvious. But you have to spend time with the systems, pay attention to details, develop what I call 'mechanical intuition.'""

This intuition became my superpower. Within six months, I could walk into a house and know within minutes whether the air conditioning problem was mechanical, electrical, or related to airflow. The work became less about following diagnostic checklists and more about having conversations with machines.

# Chapter 12: The Teachers in Overalls

The other technicians at Coastal Comfort became my extended education. Each one had developed specialties and philosophies that added layers to my understanding of both the trade and life itself.

Miguel Santos had been doing residential service for fifteen years and had perfected the art of customer communication. He could explain complex mechanical problems in simple terms, reassure anxious homeowners, and build trust within minutes of walking through their door.

""People don't buy HVAC services,"" Miguel told me as we drove between calls. ""They buy peace of mind. Your job isn't just to fix their air conditioner‚Äîit's to make them feel confident that their comfort is in good hands.""

I watched Miguel interact with customers and realized he was applying many of the same principles my grandfather had taught me about listening and building relationships. He asked about their concerns, validated their frustrations, and explained his work in ways that educated rather than confused them.

""Mrs. Johnson,"" I heard him tell an elderly customer, ""your system is running perfectly now, but I noticed your air filter hasn't been changed in a while. I'm going to show you how to do it yourself‚Äîit's easier than you think, and it'll help your system run more efficiently.""

He spent ten minutes teaching her the simple task, and she was delighted to learn something new. More importantly, she now saw Miguel not as a stranger who fixed her air conditioner, but as a helpful expert who cared about her wellbeing.

Danny Kowalski specialized in commercial installations and had the project management skills of a general contractor. He could coordinate multiple trades, manage complex timelines, and solve the logistical puzzles that come with large-scale HVAC projects.

""Residential service teaches you to be a craftsman,"" Danny explained during a lunch break. ""Commercial work teaches you to be a conductor. You're not just responsible for your own work‚Äîyou're responsible for making sure everyone else's work fits together correctly.""

Danny introduced me to the bigger picture of HVAC work‚Äîhow air conditioning systems interact with electrical systems, plumbing, building automation, and architectural design. A commercial installation wasn't just about moving air; it was about creating environments where people could work comfortably and efficiently.

""Every building has a purpose,"" he said as we surveyed a new office complex. ""Our job is to create the climate conditions that support that purpose. An office needs consistent temperatures for productivity. A restaurant needs proper ventilation for food safety. A hospital needs precise humidity control for patient health. We're not just installing equipment‚Äîwe're enabling other people's missions.""

# Chapter 13: The Science of Comfort

The technical education I received went far beyond basic repair skills. I learned about thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, electrical theory, and building science. But more than memorizing formulas, I learned to think systemically about how energy moves through buildings and how human comfort relates to temperature, humidity, air movement, and air quality.

Sarah Chen, our lead technician and the only woman in the shop, had an engineering degree and approached HVAC work with scientific precision. She introduced me to concepts that most technicians never learned, helping me understand not just how systems worked, but why they were designed the way they were.

""Most people think air conditioning is about temperature,"" Sarah explained during one of our technical discussions. ""But comfort is actually about heat transfer. The human body generates heat constantly and needs to dissipate it to maintain core temperature. Air conditioning creates the conditions that allow efficient heat transfer from your body to the environment.""

She showed me how humidity affected comfort independent of temperature, how air movement increased perceived cooling through convection and evaporation, and how radiant heat from walls and windows could make a space feel hot even when the air temperature was cool.

""This is why you can't just set a thermostat to 72 degrees and expect everyone to be comfortable,"" she continued. ""You have to consider the whole environment‚Äîair temperature, surface temperatures, humidity levels, air movement, and even the metabolic rate and clothing levels of the occupants.""

This scientific understanding transformed how I approached service calls. Instead of just fixing broken components, I began optimizing entire systems for maximum comfort and efficiency. I learned to identify and correct problems that customers didn't even know they had.

During one memorable call, I was asked to repair an air conditioner that was ""working but not cooling well."" The system was functioning normally from a mechanical standpoint, but the house never felt comfortable. After conducting a comprehensive analysis, I discovered that poor insulation, inadequate ductwork design, and excessive solar heat gain were overwhelming the system's capacity.

""Your air conditioner is fine,"" I explained to the homeowner. ""But it's fighting a losing battle against heat that shouldn't be getting into your house in the first place. We can keep repairing the symptom, or we can address the cause.""

Working with the customer, we developed a plan that included improving insulation, sealing ductwork, and installing better window treatments. The result was dramatically improved comfort and significantly lower energy bills. More importantly, I had learned to see HVAC work as part of a larger system that included the building envelope, the local climate, and the occupants' needs.

# Chapter 14: The Challenges and the Growth

The initial six months in Florida were incredibly challenging‚Äîsweaty and exhausting, with long hours that felt relentless. Every job presented its own obstacles: incorrect parts, broken fans, pests in the vents, and irate customers. I learned quickly, failed even faster, and picked myself up to learn again. I bled on copper pipes, muttered curses under my breath, and tackled the seemingly unfixable. There were countless moments when I considered quitting, but something always propelled me forward: the joy on customers' faces when cool air returned.

The physical demands of the work were unlike anything I'd experienced. Florida's heat and humidity turned every attic into a sauna, every crawl space into a steam room. I learned to work efficiently in extreme conditions, to pace myself for long days, and to stay hydrated and safe in environments that could be dangerous.

But the mental challenges were even more demanding. HVAC systems are complex, and every installation is unique. I had to learn to think on my feet, to improvise solutions when standard procedures didn't apply, and to take responsibility for repairs that affected people's daily comfort and wellbeing.

My first major failure came during a heat wave in July. I'd been called to repair a system in a house where an elderly couple lived, and I misdiagnosed the problem. Instead of a simple capacitor replacement, the system needed a new compressor‚Äîsomething I didn't realize until after I'd confidently assured them their air conditioning would be working within the hour.

The couple was understanding, but I was devastated. I had to call Rick, admit my mistake, and arrange for emergency service that wouldn't be completed until the next day. That night, knowing these elderly customers were suffering in 90-degree heat because of my error, I couldn't sleep.

""Mistakes are expensive teachers,"" Rick told me the next morning, ""but they're also the most effective ones. You'll never make that particular diagnostic error again, and you'll be more careful about promising specific timelines until you're certain of your diagnosis.""

He was right. The experience taught me humility, caution, and the importance of thorough diagnosis before making commitments to customers. It also taught me that taking responsibility for mistakes, rather than making excuses, earned more respect than trying to appear infallible.

The truck carried the scent of rubber and hope, and each day was filled with new experiences. I learned to navigate Florida's maze-like subdivisions, to work in homes that ranged from modest apartments to luxurious mansions, and to interact with customers from every demographic and economic background.

Each service call was a small adventure. I might start the day replacing a thermostat in a retirement community, spend the afternoon installing ductwork in a new construction site, and end the day troubleshooting a commercial rooftop unit at a strip mall. The variety kept the work interesting and constantly challenged me to expand my skills.

# Chapter 15: The Human Side of Service

One of the most valuable lessons I learned was that HVAC service was as much about psychology as it was about mechanics. People called for air conditioning repair when they were hot, frustrated, and often feeling vulnerable in their own homes. How I handled those emotions was as important as how I handled their equipment.

I remember one call to a small apartment where a single mother with two young children was dealing with a broken air conditioner during a particularly brutal heat wave. The children were cranky from the heat, the mother was stressed about the potential cost of repairs, and the atmosphere in the apartment was tense.

""I know this is frustrating,"" I told her after introducing myself. ""Let me take a look at what's going on, and I'll explain everything I find before doing any work.""

The problem turned out to be a clogged drain line‚Äîa simple fix that took twenty minutes and cost less than fifty dollars. But more than solving the technical problem, I had reassured a worried mother that her children would be comfortable and that the repair wouldn't break her budget.

""Thank you,"" she said as I packed up my tools. ""Not just for fixing it, but for explaining what was wrong and not making me feel stupid for not knowing.""

These human moments became the most rewarding part of the work. I was developing what my grandfather had called ""people skills""‚Äîthe ability to read emotions, communicate clearly, and make others feel respected and understood.

Another memorable call came when I was asked to service a system in a house where an elderly man lived alone. The air conditioner was working fine, but he called for service regularly, always finding small issues that needed attention. After the third call in two months, I realized what was actually happening.

""Mr. Peterson,"" I said gently, ""your system is running perfectly. Is there something else I can help you with?""

He looked embarrassed for a moment, then admitted, ""I guess I just like having someone to talk to. My wife passed away last year, and the house gets pretty quiet.""

We sat on his porch for thirty minutes, drinking iced tea and talking about everything except air conditioning. I learned about his career as a teacher, his late wife's garden, and his concerns about staying independent as he aged. When I left, I made sure to check on him during other calls in the neighborhood, not as a technician but as a young man who understood that sometimes human connection was more important than mechanical expertise.

These experiences taught me that excellent service went beyond technical competence. It required empathy, communication skills, and the wisdom to recognize what customers really needed‚Äîwhich wasn't always what they asked for.

# Chapter 16: A Life in Solo

I embarked on adventures solo. I savored Thai food for one. I attended parties, coffee in hand, free from the need to impress anyone, reveling in the joy of the moment.

This wasn't loneliness; it was something far deeper‚Äîa cultivated contentment. The kind that emerges after years of seeking understanding, only to realize that true clarity comes from understanding oneself.

The transition from the group dynamic of high school to the independence of adult life had been jarring at first. In New Jersey, I'd always been part of a family unit, a class, a social structure that provided identity and belonging. In Florida, I had to learn who I was when I wasn't defined by my relationships to others.

I maintained notes on my phone, capturing quotes from customers, snippets overheard in diners, peculiar dreams, and punchlines shared by my best friend back in Jersey. These fragments became a record of my developing perspective, a collection of moments that shaped how I saw the world.

""The best conversations happen when you're not trying to have them,"" I wrote after overhearing two retirees discussing their grandchildren at a coffee shop. They weren't performing for anyone, just genuinely sharing their joy and concerns. There was something authentic about unguarded moments that planned interactions rarely achieved.

I discovered that eating alone in restaurants wasn't lonely‚Äîit was observational. Without the distraction of conversation, I could notice details: the way the cook took pride in plating each dish, the server who remembered regular customers' preferences, the quiet satisfaction of people enjoying good food in comfortable surroundings.

One evening at a Vietnamese restaurant, I struck up a conversation with the owner, Mrs. Nguyen, who had immigrated to Florida thirty years earlier with her husband and young children.

""Starting over is hard,"" she told me as I complimented her pho. ""But also necessary. In Vietnam, I was always someone's daughter, then someone's wife, then someone's mother. Here, I had to learn who I was just as myself.""

Her words resonated deeply. Like me, she had experienced the disorientation and ultimate liberation of redefining herself in a new context. The restaurant wasn't just her business‚Äîit was her expression of independence, her contribution to her new community, her way of maintaining cultural identity while embracing American opportunity.

There‚Äôs something about Charleston ‚Äî the scent of salt in the air, the silhouettes of shrimping boats on the horizon, and the way time slows when you're holding a rod over Lowcountry waters.

Captain Woods didn‚Äôt need to learn Charleston fishing from a book ‚Äî he lived it. Raised between pluff mud banks and barrier islands, Woods grew up listening to tales from old dockhands, studying tidal patterns before he even drove a car. Now, he‚Äôs passing that legacy on to families, friends, and travelers aboard his vessel, Reel Redemption.

These waters aren‚Äôt just scenic ‚Äî they‚Äôre alive with species that tell their own story.

üé£ **Sheepshead** with their zebra stripes and human-like teeth, often found hiding among bridge pylons and oyster-stacked docks.  
üêü **Redfish (Red Drum)**, the Lowcountry‚Äôs prized fighter, known for its copper sheen and aggressive runs.  
ü¶à **Black Drum**, **spadefish**, **flounder**, and **toadfish** ‚Äî all caught on recent trips, some half-eaten by sharks as they‚Äôre reeled in, proving nature never plays nice.  
üê† **Sea trout**, sleek and silver, are especially active during early mornings and cooler months.

What makes fishing with Captain Woods different is the feeling ‚Äî it‚Äôs not a tourist ride. It‚Äôs a return to something older. Something real.

And for those looking to stay a little longer in the Lowcountry, Captain Woods also runs a cozy **Airbnb in Goose Creek**, just minutes from Charleston‚Äôs historic district. It‚Äôs where many families begin their adventure ‚Äî waking up early, walking out with coffee in hand, and heading toward the salt breeze and morning light.

üéØ Whether you're staying at an **Airbnb rental in Charleston**, visiting for the beaches, or planning an unforgettable day out with your kids, **fishing in Charleston** is one of the most authentic experiences the city offers.

Charleston, South Carolina, is a city where history meets the sea. Cobblestone streets wind past pastel antebellum homes, while the salty breeze from Charleston Harbor reminds you that the Atlantic is never far. Whether you're walking through the historic district, exploring centuries-old plantations, or catching the sunset at The Battery, Charleston invites visitors to slow down and savor its charm. Food lovers can‚Äôt miss the city's renowned Lowcountry cuisine ‚Äî from shrimp and grits to oyster roasts ‚Äî all served with genuine Southern hospitality.

But beyond its rich history and culinary fame, Charleston is a paradise for outdoor adventure. Visitors can paddle through blackwater creeks, search for dolphins along Folly Beach, or book a fishing charter and head out into the harbor for redfish, trout, or even sharks. With mild weather year-round and easy access to both city culture and coastal beauty, Charleston offers something unforgettable for every kind of traveler ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre here for a romantic getaway, a family vacation, or a day on the water with Captain Woods of Reel Redemption Charters.

1lawdce,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Moombahjoy/comments/1lawdce/addis_to_airflow_pt2/,Addis To Airflow Pt.2,"I was learning that intelligence wasn't just about academics, that problem-solving came in many forms, that there was dignity and value in work that made people's lives better in tangible ways.

The social environment was also teaching me things I hadn't expected. Class differences were more visible here, more openly discussed. Some kids drove trucks they'd bought with money from after-school jobs. Others took the bus because their families couldn't afford a second car. Some planned to join family businesses immediately after graduation. Others hoped to start their own companies eventually.

I found myself somewhere in the middle‚Äînot from a trade family, but not college-bound either. Not rich, but not struggling financially. My adoption story was less exotic here, more practical. Several of my classmates had complicated family situations too, and nobody made a big deal about origins or backgrounds.

What mattered was whether you showed up, worked hard, and helped your classmates when they needed it. The expectations were clear and achievable: learn the skills, pass the certification exams, and be ready to enter the workforce as a professional.

Outside of school, I took every job available to a kid my age. The fast food cashier taught me about customer service and working under pressure‚Äîquick hands, forced smiles, grace under the pressure of lunch rush crowds. Grocery store stock boy taught me about efficiency and physical endurance‚Äîicy fingers from frozen food aisles, the satisfaction of perfectly stocked shelves. The pool supply shop taught me chemistry and sales‚Äîlearning pH levels and water chemistry while flirting with a girl who sold chlorine tablets and knew more about pool maintenance than most adults.

Each job taught me something different, but they all taught me the value of showing up consistently, doing work well even when it was boring or difficult, and treating customers and coworkers with respect regardless of their attitude toward you.

The money was important too. For the first time in my life, I had spent money that I'd earned myself. It wasn't much, but it was mine. I could buy my own clothes, pay for dates, save toward a car. There was dignity in that independence, even in small amounts.

Mrs. Du Bois sometimes worried that I was working too much, that I should be focusing more on being a teenager.

""You're only sixteen,"" she'd say when I'd come home tired from a shift at the grocery store. ""You should be going to the movies and hanging out with friends, not working every weekend.""

""I like working,"" I'd tell her, which was mostly true. ""And I like having my own money.""

""Just don't grow up too fast,"" she'd say. ""There's plenty of time for adult responsibilities.""

But I felt like I was already behind somehow, like I needed to work harder than my peers to prove myself, to make up for lost time, to earn my place in this life I'd been given. The immigrant work ethic, maybe, even though I'd been too young when I arrived to remember making a conscious choice to work harder.

At seventeen, Mr. Delgado pulled me aside after a particularly successful lab session where I'd helped three other students troubleshoot their projects.

""You're better with tools than half the grown men I know,"" he said. ""And you're good at teaching too. You explain things in ways people can understand.""

He made a phone call to a local HVAC contractor he knew, a man who specialized in residential service calls and had a reputation for treating his apprentices well.

""Are you interested in real-world experience?"" Mr. Delgado asked. ""Summer job, maybe leading into part-time work during your senior year?""

That's how I found myself, at seventeen, in the passenger seat of a work van every morning at 7 AM, clipboard in hand, learning how ductwork snaked through ceilings like veins, how to talk to homeowners about their comfort concerns, how to diagnose problems in systems that had been installed decades before I was born.

My supervisor, Jake, was a patient teacher who'd been in the business for fifteen years. He showed me how to read a house‚Äîhow to identify the age of the system by the style of the thermostat, how to spot signs of poor installation, how to communicate with customers who were frustrated by equipment failures.

""Rule number one,"" he told me, ""is that the customer is usually right about the symptoms, even if they're wrong about the cause. If they say it's too hot upstairs, it's too hot upstairs. Don't argue with their comfort level. Your job is to figure out why and fix it.""

I learned to crawl through attics in 100-degree heat, to squeeze into crawl spaces that hadn't been visited by humans in years, to work in conditions that were uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous. But I also learned the satisfaction of solving problems that directly improved people's lives.

There's nothing quite like the moment when a broken air conditioning system kicks back on after you've fixed it. The relief on a customer's face when cool air starts flowing again. The gratitude of an elderly person whose heat had been out during a cold snap. The pride of knowing you'd made someone's day better with your skills and effort.

Each day brought new accents, new neighborhoods, new technical challenges. I worked in mansions and mobile homes, new construction and century-old houses. I met customers who knew exactly what was wrong and customers who had no idea how their systems worked but could describe exactly how they wanted to feel.

I was learning about different kinds of intelligence again, but from the other side. Customers who were doctors or lawyers or business executives would defer to my expertise when it came to their HVAC systems. My age and background didn't matter when I could solve their problems and restore their comfort.

By eighteen, I had grown into my body in ways that felt both gradual and sudden. Shoulders wider from lifting equipment, voice deeper from calling out to Jake across noisy job sites, hands calloused from handling tools and rough materials. The physical transformation felt like it matched an internal one‚Äîgrowing confidence, competence, independence.

Girls noticed, and sometimes I noticed back. There were kisses‚Äîsome soft and tentative, others passionate and clumsy. One girlfriend felt almost serious for a few months until she left for college and we realized neither of us was ready for a long-distance relationship. Another remained mostly secret because she was dating someone else too, and I wasn't ready for that kind of drama.

I liked being wanted, liked the feeling of attraction and connection, but I always sensed I was on borrowed time somehow. Not because of anything specific, but because I felt like I was still becoming myself, still figuring out who I was supposed to be. How could I promise forever to someone else when I wasn't sure yet what I was promising?

At home, I had become the family success story‚Äîthe one who worked, studied, earned good grades, and stayed out of trouble. ""You're making us proud,"" Mrs. Du Bois would say when report cards came out or when she heard good reports from my teachers.

""Take out the trash,"" Mr. Du Bois would add, as if that were equally important, which in his worldview it probably was.

I appreciated being seen as responsible, but I also felt the weight of their expectations. Other kids in the family were allowed to make mistakes, to be typical teenagers, to struggle and recover. I felt like I had to be perfect, grateful, an example of what adoption could accomplish when it worked right.

The pressure wasn't intentional, and it wasn't unfair. But it was real. I carried the knowledge that I represented more than just myself‚ÄîI was proof that the system could work, that love could transcend biology, that children could thrive when given opportunities.

Inside, something was shifting‚Äîa slow restlessness that I couldn't quite name. I was grateful for everything I'd been given, proud of what I'd accomplished, optimistic about my future. But I was also ready for something else, some new challenge or adventure that would be entirely my own.

By senior year, I had made the honor roll, received nationally recognized HVAC credentials, and memorized the names of nearly 300 students across multiple grades and schools, all of whom I could confidently call friends. I was well-liked, successful, college-bound if I wanted to be, or workforce-ready if I preferred that path.

But I felt like I was playing a role that fit well but wasn't entirely mine. The successful foster kid. The grateful adoptee. The responsible older brother. The reliable employee. All true, but not complete.

Graduation came on a Friday‚Äîa blur of hugs, caps thrown in the air, and the scent of summer asphalt baking in the June heat. That night, instead of going to the official graduation party or any of the smaller gatherings my classmates had planned, I chose to do something I'd been thinking about for months.

I packed. Everything I owned fit into my used SUV‚Äîclothes, tools, a few books, the wooden cross I'd carried from Ethiopia, pictures of the family that had raised me. I said individual goodbyes to each person in the house, even the ones I knew I'd see again soon.

The Du Bois goodbyes felt different from the others‚Äîlonger, more emotional, weighted with the knowledge that this was a real transition, not just a temporary separation.

""You don't have to leave right away,"" Mrs. Du Bois said, hugging me tighter than usual. ""This will always be your home.""

""I know,"" I said. ""But I need to see what I can build on my own.""

Mr. Du Bois shook my hand, then pulled me into a hug. ""You're going to do fine,"" he said. ""You've got good instincts and a strong work ethic. That'll take you far.""

I left early Saturday morning, driving south on I-95 toward Florida. I'd chosen Florida partly because of the weather‚Äîconstant demand for air conditioning meant steady work‚Äîand partly because it felt far enough away to be truly independent but not so far that I couldn't come home if I needed to.

But mostly I chose it because it was mine. My choice, my adventure, my chance to find out who I was when I wasn't being anyone's son or brother or student or example.

By Monday, my new independent life was set in motion.

# Chapter 6: Tools and Transformation

The apartment I found was small but clean, with functioning appliances and reasonable rent. More importantly, it had central air conditioning that rattled slightly when it kicked on but worked reliably‚Äîwhich I took as a good omen for an HVAC technician starting his career in Florida.

My roommate, Miss Arlene, was a seventy-four-year-old former librarian who wore lipstick even when she wasn't going anywhere and maintained a front porch decorated with wind chimes and potted basil. She owned six umbrellas but never used any of them, preferring to get wet during the frequent afternoon thunderstorms that swept across central Florida.

""Rain is good for the skin,"" she'd say, standing on the porch watching the storm clouds roll in. ""All those expensive moisturizers women buy, and God gives us the best treatment for free.""

I paid my rent on time, kept the common areas clean, and fixed anything mechanical that broke without being asked. We got along splendidly, developing the kind of easy friendship that sometimes springs up between people from completely different generations who happen to need the same things: affordable housing, reliable companionship, and mutual respect for each other's space.

""You've got old eyes,"" she remarked one evening as we sat on the porch, she with her tea and coupon circular, me with a beer and a technical manual I was studying for an upcoming certification exam.

""That's either a compliment or a warning,"" I replied.

""Compliment,"" she said firmly. ""Means you've seen things, learned from them. Most boys your age have young eyes‚Äîeverything's new and surprising. But you look at things like you're figuring them out, not just seeing them for the first time.""

I thought about that observation for weeks afterward. Old eyes. Maybe that's what adoption gives you, or trauma, or just the experience of living between worlds. The ability to see things from multiple angles, to understand that most situations are more complicated than they first appear.

The work was everything I'd hoped for and harder than I'd expected. Florida's climate meant constant demand for HVAC services‚Äîair conditioning systems working overtime in the humid heat, heat pumps struggling with the occasional cold snaps, ductwork breeding mold in the moisture-rich environment.

My company, Comfort Solutions, specialized in residential service calls. We were the people homeowners called when their systems failed, when their comfort was compromised, when they needed problems solved quickly and professionally.

The initial six months were incredibly challenging‚Äîsweaty, exhausting work with long hours that felt relentless. Every job presented its own obstacles: incorrect parts that had to be special-ordered, thirty-year-old systems with discontinued components, mysterious electrical issues that defied logic, pest infestations in ductwork, and customers whose frustration with broken equipment sometimes got directed at whoever showed up to fix it.

I learned quickly, failed even faster, and picked myself up to learn again. I bled on copper pipes during soldering jobs, muttered curses under my breath when diagnoses proved wrong, and tackled problems that seemed impossible until they suddenly weren't.

There were countless moments when I considered quitting‚Äîusually around 2 PM on 95-degree days when I was lying in a 130-degree attic trying to replace a blower motor while sweat dripped into my eyes and insulation itched against every exposed patch of skin.

But something always propelled me forward: the satisfaction of solving complex problems, the gratitude of customers when their comfort was restored, the growing confidence that came with mastering skills that genuinely helped people.

My van became my mobile office, workshop, and sometimes refuge. It carried the scent of rubber seals and refrigerant, metal tools and electrical components. The radio played everything from Cuban salsa to country music to talk radio, depending on the neighborhood and my mood. Some days I drove over 200 miles between service calls, crisscrossing the metro area from suburban subdivisions to rural farmhouses to urban apartment complexes.

Each call was a small adventure. I never knew what I'd find when I knocked on a door‚Äîwhat kind of system I'd be working on, what kind of customer I'd be serving, what kind of problem I'd need to solve. The variety kept the work interesting even when the heat made it grueling.

There was the elderly couple whose 40-year-old heat pump had finally given up, who served me lemonade while I explained their options and helped them choose a replacement system that would serve them for the rest of their lives. There was the single mother whose air conditioning had failed during her daughter's birthday party, who cried with relief when I got it running again in time to save the celebration. There was the retired engineer who knew more about thermodynamics than I did but couldn't figure out why his system was short-cycling, and who became a regular customer after I solved it by replacing a faulty pressure switch he'd overlooked.

I learned to read houses like books‚Äîhow to identify the age and type of systems from external clues, how to spot signs of poor installation or maintenance, how to communicate with homeowners about problems they couldn't see and solutions they didn't understand.

""Rule number two,"" Jake had told me during my apprenticeship, ""is that you're often the translator between the equipment and the customer. They know what they want‚Äîto be comfortable‚Äîbut they don't know how the system works or what it needs. Your job is to bridge that gap.""

I got good at explaining complex technical issues in simple terms, helping customers understand their options without overwhelming them with unnecessary details. I learned to identify which customers wanted minimal information and which ones wanted to understand every aspect of the repair.

The physical demands of the work transformed my body in ways I hadn't expected. My shoulders broadened from lifting heavy equipment. My hands developed permanent calluses from handling tools and rough materials. My back strengthened from crawling through tight spaces and working in awkward positions.

But the mental demands were equally transformative. Every day required problem-solving skills, technical knowledge, customer service abilities, and the kind of adaptability that comes from never knowing exactly what you'll encounter next.

I was learning that competence builds confidence in ways that praise or encouragement never can. Each successfully completed repair, each satisfied customer, each complex problem solved added to a growing sense that I could handle whatever came next.

The work also connected me to the community in ways I hadn't anticipated. Unlike many jobs where you interact with the same people every day, service work meant entering dozens of homes each week, meeting families in their private spaces, solving problems that affected their daily comfort and quality of life.

I worked in mansions and mobile homes, new construction and historic houses, apartments and condominiums. I met customers who were wealthy and customers who saved for months to afford necessary repairs. I worked for doctors and lawyers and business executives, but also for mechanics and teachers and retirees on fixed incomes.

What struck me most was how universal the need for comfort was, and how grateful people were when you could restore it. Rich or poor, young or old, everyone wanted their home to be a refuge from the heat, a place where they could relax and be comfortable.

The technical skills were important, but the human skills were equally valuable. Learning to listen to customers' concerns, to explain problems clearly, to work efficiently in their homes while respecting their space and privacy. Learning to stay calm when equipment fails in unexpected ways, to think creatively when standard solutions don't work, to maintain professionalism even when dealing with difficult people or impossible situations.

By the end of my first year, I had developed a reputation for reliability and skill that led to repeat customers and referrals. Homeowners began asking for me specifically when they called the company. My supervisor started assigning me the more complex jobs, the ones that required diagnostic skills rather than just routine maintenance.

""You've got a gift for this work,"" he told me during my annual review. ""Not just the technical stuff‚Äîanyone can learn that. But the way you interact with customers, the way you think through problems, the way you stay calm under pressure. That's not something we can teach.""

I was proud of that assessment, but I was also aware that my success felt different from the success I'd experienced in school. Academic achievement had always felt somewhat artificial to me‚Äîgrades based on tests that measured my ability to remember and regurgitate information, but not necessarily my ability to do anything useful with that knowledge.

Work success felt more real, more meaningful. When I fixed someone's air conditioning, they were immediately and tangibly better off. When I solved a complex diagnostic puzzle, the solution was either right or wrong‚Äîno ambiguity, no subjective interpretation.

There was something deeply satisfying about work that produced clear, measurable results. Problems that were solved stayed solved. Customers who were comfortable stayed comfortable. Skills that were mastered could be relied upon indefinitely.

The money was good too‚Äîbetter than I'd expected for someone just starting out. Not enough to get rich, but enough to live independently, save for the future, and help out my adoptive family when they needed it. There was dignity in that financial independence, in knowing that I could support myself and contribute to the people who had invested in me.

But beyond the money and the technical satisfaction, there was something else the work gave me: a sense of purpose that felt authentic and chosen rather than assigned or expected.

I wasn't fixing air conditioners because someone told me to, or because it was the path of least resistance, or because it was what people expected from someone with my background. I was doing it because I was good at it, because it served a real need, because it connected me to my community in meaningful ways.

For the first time in my life, I felt like I was exactly where I was supposed to be, doing exactly what I was meant to do.







# Between Two Worlds: A Memoir of Home, Heritage, and Air Conditioning

# Act III: Freon and Film Reels

# Chapter 1: The Red Door

The room was spacious and empty, yet it carried the scent of vanilla candles and Pine-Sol. The A/C rattled slightly when it kicked on, but it worked‚Äîthat's what mattered. Moving to Florida the day after high school graduation had been my declaration of independence, my bridge between the diverse family that raised me in New Jersey and whatever version of myself I was meant to become.

My roommate, Miss Arlene, a seventy-four-year-old former librarian, wore lipstick even when she wasn't going out. Her front porch was adorned with wind chimes and potted basil. She owned six umbrellas but never used any of them. I paid rent on time, kept the common areas tidy, and fixed anything mechanical without being asked. We got along splendidly.

""You've got old eyes,"" she remarked one evening, sipping tea and flipping through a coupon booklet.

""That's either a compliment or a warning."" I didn't know which I preferred.

""Both,"" she said, not looking up from her coupons. ""Old eyes see things others miss. But they also carry weight that young shoulders shouldn't have to bear.""

Miss Arlene had a way of saying things that stuck with you long after the conversation ended. She'd been a librarian for forty-three years, she told me, and had developed what she called ""people radar""‚Äîthe ability to read a person's story just by watching how they moved through space.

""You move like someone who's been places,"" she observed another day, watching me oil the hinges on the kitchen cabinets without being asked. ""But you also move like someone still trying to figure out where they belong.""

She wasn't wrong. At eighteen, fresh out of a New Jersey high school where I'd been surrounded by the loving chaos of my adoptive family, Florida felt like stepping into a different dimension. The humidity was a living thing that wrapped around you before you'd even stepped out of air conditioning. The palm trees looked like something from a postcard. The accents were different, the food was different, even the way people said ""good morning"" carried a different rhythm.

But it was exactly what I needed‚Äîa blank slate where I could figure out who I was when I wasn't somebody's adopted son, somebody's classmate, somebody's project. In Florida, I was just another young man trying to make his way, and that anonymity felt like freedom.

# Chapter 2: The Patriarch

My sister lived just north of the highway in a peaceful condo, equipped with modern appliances and a lovely view. Our conversations had deepened since my move, encompassing shared experiences, dreams, goals, gossip, and complaints that wove a strong connection to our family back in Jersey. However, since relocating to Florida, the person I had grown closest to was someone I never anticipated feeling such a bond with: my estranged grandfather.

He wasn't actually estranged‚Äîthat was just family shorthand for ""the one who lived too far away to see regularly."" But distance had a way of making people mythical, and my grandfather had achieved legendary status in our family stories long before I ever sat across from him at his kitchen table.

His house sat like a period at the end of a quiet sentence, marked by a clean yard and a red door that seemed to glow even in the harsh Florida afternoon sun. The paint was fresh, the lawn was edged with military precision, and not a single palm frond was allowed to linger on his driveway for more than a day. This was the home of a man who understood that details mattered, that taking care of what you had was the first step toward earning what you wanted.

From the moment you stepped inside, you were home. The furniture was comfortable without being fancy, the walls held photographs spanning decades, and everything had its place. But more than the physical space, there was something about his presence that made you feel settled. He had the kind of calm confidence that comes from a lifetime of making good decisions and learning from the bad ones.

The first time I visited, I'd knocked tentatively, not sure what to expect from this grandfather I barely knew. The door swung open to reveal a man in his seventies with sharp eyes, calloused hands, and a smile that started small but grew when he recognized something familiar in my face.

""Well, I'll be damned,"" he said, his voice carrying the hint of an accent I couldn't quite place. That first afternoon stretched into evening as we sat on his back porch, looking out over the canal that ran behind his house. He asked about my move, my job prospects, my plans. But he didn't ask in that probing way adults usually questioned teenagers. He asked like someone genuinely curious about another person's story.

""You know what I learned in my seventy-three years?"" he said, watching a heron pick its way through the shallow water. ""People spend too much time trying to figure out who they're supposed to be instead of paying attention to who they already are.""

I wasn't sure what he meant then, but something in his tone made me file the comment away for later consideration.

""Tell me something,"" he continued. ""What's your dream car?""

The question caught me off guard. ""I don't know. I've never really thought about it.""

""Well, think about it now. If money wasn't an issue, if practicality didn't matter, what would you drive?""

I considered this seriously. ""Maybe something classic. A Mustang, maybe? Or one of those old Camaros?""

He nodded approvingly. ""Good choices. Mine was always a Jaguar. Still is, I suppose, though I'll never buy one now.""

""Why not?""

""Because I learned the difference between wanting something and needing something. I wanted a Jaguar for forty years. Dreamed about it, saved for it, planned for it. Then my buddy Harold bought one."" He chuckled, shaking his head. ""That car spent more time in the shop than in his driveway. Harold used to say he didn't own a Jaguar‚Äîhe was paying rent on one for the mechanics.""

""So you gave up the dream?""

""I adjusted the dream. Instead of a car that looked good in the driveway, I wanted a car that would take me places. Bought a Toyota instead. Still driving it fifteen years later, and it's never left me stranded once.""

This story became one of my favorites from our conversations. Here was a man with very few regrets, someone whose confidence in his choices was so strong that I believed his recommendations should be treated as guarantees. More than that, he had the wisdom to distinguish between wants and needs, between dreams worth chasing and dreams worth adjusting.

# Chapter 3: Hooks and Stories

It all commenced with a meal shared with a family of strangers, and I emerged from that experience with valuable lessons. My background in customer service‚Äîsummer jobs in Jersey had taught me how to navigate conversations with people I'd just met‚Äîequipped me to handle the initial awkwardness that often arose when talking to newcomers. But with my grandfather, the awkwardness evaporated almost immediately.

We would often catch pufferfish and catfish off the back dock, using equipment that looked like it belonged in a museum but worked better than anything modern I'd ever seen. When my dad visited from Jersey, we would set crab traps in the water, creating a ritual that felt both ancient and immediate. There was something about standing on that dock, lines in the water, that encouraged conversation without demanding it.

""You know what I like about fishing?"" my grandfather asked one afternoon, reeling in another catfish. ""It's honest work. The fish don't care about your resume or your bank account. They either bite or they don't, and either way, you've spent time doing something real.""

But more than any activity, we frequented movie nights. As I recall, this is precisely how our tradition began:

""You watch movies?""

""Only the good ones.""

""Perfect.""

Thus, our bond was born. Every Tuesday became sacred time: A movie. A meal. A story. A joke that I would jot down in my Notes app under ""Old Man Wisdom.""

The first movie we watched together was *Thunderbolt and Lightfoot*, a 1974 film starring Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. I'd never heard of it, but my grandfather had pulled it from a collection of DVDs that looked like he'd been curating for decades.

""This one's got everything,"" he announced, settling into his recliner with a bowl of popcorn balanced on his armrest. ""Action, humor, friendship, and the kind of ending that'll make you think.""

He was right. The movie was about two unlikely partners who team up for a bank heist, but really it was about finding connection in unexpected places, about the ways people save each other without even realizing it. As the credits rolled, my grandfather turned to me with a satisfied nod.

""That's what I call a complete meal,"" he said. ""Entertainment, but also substance. Too many movies these days are all seasoning and no meat.""

The next week, we watched *Bullitt*, and I began to understand his taste. These weren't just action movies‚Äîthey were character studies disguised as thrillers. Steve McQueen's Frank Bullitt was a man who understood duty, who did his job with quiet competence and moral clarity.

""See how he doesn't need to tell everyone how tough he is?"" my grandfather pointed out during the famous car chase scene. ""Tough guys don't announce themselves. They just handle business.""

*Reservoir Dogs* came next, and I braced myself for his reaction to Tarantino's violence and profanity. Instead, he was fascinated by the structure, the way the story unfolded through dialogue and flashbacks.

""This Tarantino fellow understands something most directors don't,"" he said afterward. ""People reveal themselves through what they say when they think nobody important is listening. Every character in that movie told you exactly who they were just by talking.""

*Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2* sparked a conversation about justice versus revenge, about the difference between fighting for something and fighting against something. We spent an entire evening discussing whether The Bride was a hero or an anti-hero, and whether it mattered as long as her motivation was pure.

""Motivation is everything,"" my grandfather concluded. ""The same action can be noble or despicable depending on why you're doing it. The Bride wasn't killing for pleasure or power. She was killing to get back to her daughter. That makes all the difference.""

We worked our way through all of *The Sopranos*, which gave us weeks of material to discuss. My grandfather was particularly drawn to the relationship between Tony and his own father figures, the way the past kept pulling Tony back even when he was trying to move forward.

""That's the thing about family,"" he said during one of our post-episode discussions. ""You can't choose them, but you can choose what you do with the lessons they teach you. Tony kept learning the wrong lessons from the wrong people.""

But the evening that cemented our relationship happened when we discovered a YouTube video titled ""Best of Rodney Dangerfield."" We laughed until we cried, my grandfather slapping his knee and repeating his favorite lines back to me in a surprisingly good Dangerfield impression.

""I tell you, I don't get no respect at all. I went to my doctor. I said, 'Doctor, every morning when I get up and look in the mirror I feel like throwing up. What's wrong with me?' He said, 'Nothing. You have perfect eyesight.'""

We must have watched that compilation five times, and each viewing revealed new layers to Dangerfield's genius. My grandfather particularly appreciated his style of humor which had become all but lost in the modern era.

""Takes a confident man to make fun of himself like that,"" he observed. ""Dangerfield knew exactly who he was, and he wasn't afraid to let other people laugh at it. That's real strength‚Äîbeing so comfortable with yourself that other people's opinions can't touch you.""

After watching *The Dark Knight*, where the Joker's chaos ultimately triumphs over Batman's order, my grandfather made a comment that became one of my most treasured pieces of his wisdom:

""I didn't like it. I only like it when the good guys win.""

He said this while his feet rested on the coffee table, popcorn in hand as he tossed kernels perfectly into his mouth with the accuracy of someone who'd perfected the technique over decades.

""But that's not realistic,"" I argued. ""Bad things happen to good people all the time.""

""You're right,"" he agreed. ""But that's exactly why I need my movies to show me a world where good triumphs. I see enough of the other kind of world on the news. When I'm watching a story, I want to be reminded that decent people doing decent things can make a difference.""

This wasn't naivety‚Äîit was intentional hope. My grandfather had lived through enough real-world darkness to understand the value of fictional light. His movie preferences weren't escapism; they were fuel for the kind of optimism that kept him getting up every morning ready to be part of the solution.

# Chapter 4: The Listening Patriarch

One of my favorite qualities about my grandpa was his ability to relate to any topic we discussed, drawing from his life experiences to share insights that perfectly encapsulated the situation, conflict, or emotion at hand. But more than his wisdom, what made him incredibly special to me was how he listened‚Äîintently, as if every word mattered. And when he spoke, people paid attention, not only because he was the patriarch of our family but also because he was a trailblazer, visionary, businessman, and a myriad of other admirable traits that defined him as a remarkable grandfather and human being.

During one of our Tuesday sessions, I found myself telling him about the challenges of starting over in a new place, about the loneliness that sometimes crept in despite the excitement of independence.

""You know,"" he said, settling back in his chair, ""when I was about your age, I took a job selling vacuum cleaners door-to-door. This was back in the fifties, and I was convinced I was going to revolutionize the cleaning industry.""

He chuckled at the memory, his eyes getting that distant look that meant a good story was coming.

""First week, I didn't sell a single vacuum. Not one. I was so discouraged I almost quit. But then I met this old woman‚Äîshe must have been eighty‚Äîwho invited me in for coffee even though she had no intention of buying anything. We talked for two hours about everything except vacuum cleaners. Her husband had passed recently, and she was just lonely for conversation.""

""Did you ever sell her a vacuum?""

""Nope. But she taught me something more valuable than any sale. She said, 'Son, people don't buy things from strangers. They buy things from people they trust. And trust isn't built by talking‚Äîit's built by listening.'""

He paused to let this sink in.

""Changed my whole approach. Instead of trying to convince people they needed what I was selling, I started asking them what they actually needed. Started listening to their answers. Within a month, I was the top salesman in the district.""

""And that's when you learned to listen?""

""That's when I learned the difference between hearing and listening. Hearing is automatic‚Äîsound waves hit your eardrums whether you want them to or not. Listening is a choice. It's deciding that what someone else has to say matters enough for you to stop thinking about your own response and really pay attention to theirs.""

This distinction became a cornerstone of how I approached relationships from that point forward. My grandfather had shown me that listening wasn't passive‚Äîit was one of the most active things you could do for another person.

Another evening, I mentioned feeling pressure to figure out my entire future immediately, to have a ten-year plan and stick to it.

""Let me tell you about my business philosophy,"" he said, getting up to retrieve a photo album from the bookshelf. He flipped to a picture of himself standing next to a small storefront with ""Henderson's Hardware"" painted on the window.

""I owned this place for thirty-two years,"" he said. ""When I bought it, I had grand plans. I was going to expand, open multiple locations, and build an empire. You know what I actually did?""

""What?""

""I learned to be the best hardware store owner on the block. I knew every customer's name, remembered what they'd bought before, could predict what they'd need before they knew it themselves. I didn't build an empire, but I built something more valuable‚Äîa place where people felt understood.""

He turned the page to show pictures of regular customers, employees who'd worked there for decades, and community events held in the store's parking lot.

# Prologue: Smoke and Silence

In the beginning, before words took form, there was color. The sky over the¬† was sharp and endless, a blue so profound it seemed capable of enveloping you entirely. The red dust rose from the ground as children raced barefoot between trees, while the sun, heavy and certain, spread its warmth across rooftops made of clay and thatch. I recall the yellow dress his sister wore, fluttering like a flag in the courtyard. The soft clinking of goat bells accompanied the passing birds, and the aroma of injera batter fermented in clay bowls on warm windowsills lingered in the air. A woman's laughter‚Äîsometimes near, sometimes behind a wall‚Äîalways resonated, rising like a song whose name I had forgotten.

I remember hands. Rough, kind hands. Dark hands that tied knots, lifted pots, and smoothed the top of my head when I cried. Sometimes, in dreams, the light shifted, and the air became infused with the scent of lemongrass smoke and sour milk. I would awaken with my heart racing, bewildered by the memories.

At night, there was singing‚Äîlow, sacred sounds. The songs filled me, wrapping me in warmth, even if I didn't understand the words. They belonged to something older, something grander, like a land unto itself. Yet, as memory grows young, it fades sideways.

The house? Gone. Its edges blur. The village? A smear of color, a half-formed shape in a watercolor sky. The people? Just eyes and touches, laughter echoing in my lungs. Yet, there is one moment that remains vivid:

A silence. A day without singing. No cooking. No footsteps. The goats did not pass. I sat in the dirt outside a door that would not open, cradling something warm and wet in my lap‚Äîa cloth? A fruit? I couldn't tell.

From that moment, everything changed.

I would later hear fragments of the story, but that day‚Äîthe one when the sounds ceased‚Äîremains my last true memory of Ethiopia. Even now, in quiet rooms or beneath a blistering sun, I can feel it: the moment something ended, even if no one told me what.

What I know now, pieced together from whispered conversations and official documents kept in manila folders, is this: my parents died when I was four. Disease, violence, circumstances beyond my understanding then and still partially beyond my grasp now. There was a refugee camp, months that exist in my memory only as sensations‚Äîheat, dust, waiting. Then planes, papers, people speaking languages that sounded like water over stones.

But memory is a liar and a poet both. It keeps what it wants and discards the rest. What it kept for me was color and sound and the feeling of hands that held me when the world stopped making sense. What it discarded were the details that might have explained how a boy from the Ethiopian lands ended up in a house in Pennsylvania, watching snow fall for the first time on Christmas night.

The social worker who brought me to the Du Bois family had kind eyes and a voice that stayed steady even when I wouldn't speak. She carried a bag with my things‚Äînot many things, just clothes that didn't fit right and a small wooden cross that I clutched like it might save me from drowning. She spoke to Mrs. Du Bois in low tones while I sat on a couch that was softer than anything I'd ever touched, staring at a Christmas tree that looked like it had captured stars.

""He hasn't said much,"" the social worker explained. ""The trauma... sometimes children go quiet. Sometimes it takes time.""

Mrs. Du Bois knelt down to my level, her face open and patient. ""Hi, sweetheart,"" she said. ""I'm going to take care of you now. Is that okay?""

I didn't answer. I couldn't. But I didn't pull away when she reached out to smooth my hair, the same gesture I remembered from those rough, kind hands in another life.

That night, as snow began to fall‚Äîthe first snow I'd ever seen‚ÄîI stood at the window of what they told me was my room. The yellow walls were warm in the lamplight, and a nightlight shaped like a teardrop cast soft shadows. I pressed my forehead against the cold glass and watched the flakes dance down, silent and miraculous.

In Ethiopia, I learned later, there are more than 80 languages spoken. I probably knew at least two of them once. But that night, watching the snow, I had no words in any language for what I was feeling. Relief, maybe. Terror, certainly. But also something else‚Äîa sense that this silence, unlike the one that had ended my old life, might be the beginning of something new.

The cross was still in my pocket. I pulled it out and held it up to the window, watching the snow fall around it like a blessing I didn't yet understand how to receive.





# Part I: Arrival

# Chapter 1: New Snow

The first thing I remember about America is the serene sound of snow as it falls. It arrived on Christmas night, soft, cold, and miraculous. By morning, my yard transformed into a world without edges. Trees donned coats of white, and the street disappeared under a blanket of hush. I stood by the window of the Du Bois house, my forehead pressed against the glass, watching the flakes dance down like magic for the first time.

The Du Bois home was filled with the aroma of monkey bread. It was quiet, yet warm. I shared a large room at the end of the hall, with yellow walls and a nightlight shaped like a teardrop. I never requested it, yet it remained lit every night.

In those early days, I barely spoke. Words floated past me, strange and swift, like leaves in the wind. But I observed. I watched how they used their hands while speaking, the rhythm of their laughter, and how Mr. Du Bois cleared his throat before telling a joke.

The house itself was a revelation. Hot water that came from turning a handle. Lights that responded to switches. A refrigerator that hummed with cold abundance. I would stand in front of it sometimes, just opening and closing the door, marveling at the interior light that came on each time like a small miracle.

Mrs. Du Bois‚Äîcall me Mom, she insisted, though it took me months to manage it‚Äîmoved through the house with an easy grace that spoke of years of caring for children who weren't born to her. There were pictures on the mantelpiece of other kids, other Christmases, other first days of school. I studied those faces, wondering if they had all started like me‚Äîsilent, uncertain, clutching pieces of lives they couldn't quite remember.

Mr. Du Bois was different from his wife‚Äîmore reserved, slower to offer physical comfort, but steady in ways that mattered. He would sit at the kitchen table every morning with his coffee and newspaper, and after a few days, he started setting out a small glass of orange juice next to his cup. He never asked if I wanted it, never made a show of it, just placed it there and waited. On the fourth morning, I climbed onto the chair beside him and drank it while he read me the weather forecast.

""Snow tonight,"" he said, pointing to a symbol that looked like tiny stars. ""Have you ever seen snow before?""

I shook my head.

""Well,"" he said, folding the paper and looking at me seriously, ""you're in for a treat.""

He was right. That evening, as the first flakes began to fall, the whole family gathered at the living room window. There were other children‚Äîbiological kids and foster kids and kids whose status in the house I couldn't quite parse but who belonged there nonetheless. They pointed and laughed and pressed their faces to the glass, and slowly, I found myself doing the same.

""Make a wish,"" whispered Sarah, one of the older girls, her breath fogging the window. ""First snow is magic.""

I closed my eyes and wished for something I couldn't have named then‚Äînot to remember everything I'd lost, but to understand what I'd found.

The next morning, I woke to a world transformed. Everything familiar had been erased and rewritten in white. The bare trees had become crystal sculptures. The fence posts wore caps of snow like tiny hats. Even the mailbox looked different, softer somehow, like the sharp edges of this new world had been smoothed just for me.

Mrs. Du Bois appeared in my doorway with clothes I'd never seen before‚Äîthick pants and a coat that crinkled when I moved and boots that came up to my knees.

""Snow clothes,"" she explained, helping me into them. ""Can't go out there in summer stuff.""

Outside was cold in a way I'd never experienced. The air bit at my cheeks and made my breath visible, like I was a dragon exhaling smoke. But there was something exhilarating about it too. The other kids showed me how to make angels by falling backward into the snow and moving my arms and legs. They taught me to pack the snow into balls and throw them at trees, at fences, at each other.

I was still quiet, but I was learning. Learning that laughter sounded different in cold air. Learning that my footprints in the snow were proof I'd been somewhere, done something, existed in this white-washed world. Learning that when I got too cold, there would be hot chocolate waiting inside, and someone would help me out of the wet clothes, and the nightlight would still be glowing in my room.

That first week was a blur of new experiences, each one filing itself away in my memory like evidence of a life I was learning to live. The taste of pancakes with real maple syrup. The feeling of carpet under bare feet. The sound of the television in the evening, voices and music filling spaces that might otherwise be silent.

But it was the small kindnesses that stayed with me most. The way Mrs. Du Bois would touch my shoulder when she passed behind my chair at dinner. The way Mr. Du Bois saved the sports section of the newspaper for me, even though I couldn't read it yet, because I liked the pictures. The way the older kids made space for me on the couch during movie night, not making a big deal of it, just shifting over so I could see.

One evening, about a week after the snow, I was sitting on my bed looking at a picture book when Mrs. Du Bois came in to say goodnight. She sat down beside me and pointed to a picture of a family having a picnic.

""That looks fun, doesn't it?"" she said.

I nodded.

""Maybe when it gets warm, we can have a picnic too. Would you like that?""

I looked at her‚Äîreally looked at her‚Äîfor maybe the first time since I'd arrived. Her face was open, patient, hopeful. There were small lines around her eyes that spoke of years of smiling, years of caring for children who needed caring for.

""Yes,"" I said. It was the first word I'd spoken since arriving.

Her smile was radiant. ""Good,"" she said, kissing the top of my head. ""I'm so glad you're here.""

As she turned off the overhead light, leaving only the teardrop nightlight glowing, I understood something I hadn't before. This wasn't temporary. This wasn't just shelter from a storm. This was home, or at least the beginning of one.

Outside, the snow continued to fall, quiet and steady, covering the world in forgiveness.

# Chapter 2: Learning the Language of Belonging

English came quickly‚Äînot because it was simple, but because it was everywhere. Television helped; cartoons taught me the sounds of friendship, teasing, and joy. My siblings brought chaos and a vernacular unique to our home, filled with staples I would never forget, like scooch, moosey, and ""Pittsburgh's going to the Super Bowl.""

But there were other languages to learn too, subtler ones that had nothing to do with words.

The language of morning routines: how to wait your turn for the bathroom, how to make your bed without being asked, how to pour cereal without spilling milk on the counter. The language of dinnertime: saying grace when Mr. Du Bois bowed his head, passing dishes to the right, asking to be excused before leaving the table.

The language of school was harder. Mrs. Henderson, my first-grade teacher, spoke in a voice like honey, slow and sweet, but school itself was a storm of noise and movement that left me exhausted. Children everywhere, all of them knowing things I didn't know, all of them confident in ways I couldn't imagine being.

I was placed in ESL classes‚ÄîEnglish as a Second Language‚Äîthough I couldn't remember what my first language had been. The teacher, Ms. Rodriguez, had patient eyes and spoke to us in three different languages depending on what we needed to hear. There were other children like me in those classes: Maria, whose family had come from El Salvador; Chen, who drew pictures of mountains when he missed China; Dmitri, whose Russian accent made everything sound like a secret.

We learned English together, practicing on each other first before trying it out in the wider world. ""Good morning."" ""Please pass the glue."" ""May I use the bathroom?"" Each phrase was a small victory, a step closer to belonging.

But belonging was more complicated than language. It was understandable when someone asked ""How are you?"" they didn't actually want to know how you were. It was learning to laugh at jokes even when you didn't understand them, just to fit in. It was figuring out that some questions‚Äîlike ""Where are you from?""‚Äîdidn't have easy answers.

At home, the Du Bois family created a bubble where difference was normal. Around the dinner table, stories flew in various accents and rhythms. Marcus, sixteen and born in Haiti, would slip into Creole when he got excited about something. Elena, thirteen and adopted from Guatemala, dreamed in Spanish and sometimes woke up crying for reasons she couldn't explain. James, who was Mr. and Mrs. Du Bois's biological son, spoke the language of sports statistics and comic book trivia with equal fluency.

I learned that families could be built rather than just born. That love could grow in translation. That home was less about where you came from and more about where you were accepted.

The first time someone at school called me ""adopted,"" they said it like it was something shameful, something less than. I came home upset, though I couldn't articulate why. Mrs. Du Bois sat me down at the kitchen table with a glass of milk and a cookie.

""What makes a family?"" she asked.

I thought about it. ""Living together?""

""That's part of it. What else?""

""Taking care of each other?""

""Yes. What else?""

I was quiet for a long time. Finally: ""Love?""

""That's right,"" she said. ""Love. Not blood, not biology, not where you started. Love. Choice. Commitment. That's what makes a family.""

She pulled out a photo album I'd never seen before, filled with pictures of children who had lived in this house over the years. Some looked like her and Mr. Du Bois. Others didn't. Some stayed for months, others for years. Some had arrived as babies, others as teenagers.

""This is Michael,"" she said, pointing to a boy with dark skin and a shy smile. ""He came to us when he was eight, stayed until he graduated high school. He's a teacher now in Philadelphia. And this is Carmen‚Äîshe was with us for two years before she went to live with her grandmother in Texas. She sends us Christmas cards.""

Page after page of children who had been part of this family, loved and cared for and launched into their own lives. I realized I was already part of this album, part of this story.

""Some people,"" Mrs. Du Bois continued, ""think that families have to look a certain way or start a certain way. But I think families are like gardens. You plant love, you tend it every day, and something beautiful grows. It doesn't matter what kind of seeds you start with.""

That night, I looked at myself in the bathroom mirror‚Äîdark skin, Ethiopian features, eyes that held memories I couldn't access. I looked different from everyone else in this house, but I was learning that different didn't mean wrong. It just meant something interesting.

The breakthrough came about three months after I'd arrived. I was in the living room practicing my reading when Sarah, one of the older kids, came in crying. She'd had a fight with her boyfriend and was upset in the way only teenagers can be upset‚Äîlike the world was ending and it was all her fault and no one would ever understand.

Without thinking about it, I got up and sat beside her on the couch. I couldn't fix her problem, couldn't offer advice, couldn't even fully understand what was wrong. But I could sit with her. I could be present for her pain the way others had been present for mine.

""Thanks,"" she said eventually, wiping her eyes. ""You're a good brother.""

Brother. The word hit me like a surprise gift. I had been so focused on learning to be an American, to be a student, to be adopted, that I hadn't realized I was also learning to be a sibling.

That spring, as promised, we had our picnic. The whole family piled into two cars and drove to a park where there were grills and picnic tables and a playground that stretched toward the sky. I watched Mr. Du Bois flip hamburgers while Mrs. Du Bois spread a checkered tablecloth. I played catch with Marcus and helped Elena set out paper plates.

As we sat around the table eating and laughing, I felt something shift inside me. The Ethiopian boy who had arrived in winter, silent and scared, was still there‚Äîwould always be there. But he was expanding, making room for this new identity: American son, foster brother, student, friend.

When people asked where I was from now, I had an answer: ""Here. I'm from here.""

It wasn't the whole truth, but it wasn't a lie either. It was the beginning of understanding that identity could be as layered and complex as the language I was learning to speak‚Äîfull of new words built on the foundation of older ones, all of them true, all of them mine.

# Chapter 3: The Sound of Family

School days began with uniforms‚Äîkhaki pants and burgundy shirts. Amid the hustle of sports events, I learned family routines like homework and dinner at five-thirty. Some Fridays were movie nights, depending on whether Mom and Dad were home; we would have a selection process where diplomacy flew out the window, and lights out was by seven, depending on age, of course.

But let's return to the story. I didn't miss my old life. Mostly because I had forgotten, but also because it had folded itself into a small, protected part of me‚Äîa package I wasn't ready to open yet.

The Du Bois household ran on rhythms that became as natural to me as breathing. Morning chaos as six kids fought for bathroom time and searched for lost homework. The sound of Mrs. Du Bois calling ""Five minutes!"" from the kitchen, which really meant ten, but motivated us to move faster anyway. The way Mr. Du Bois stood by the door with car keys, patient but alert, ready to ferry whoever needed ferrying to whatever they needed to get to.

Breakfast was usually grabbed on the run‚Äîtoast and juice, maybe cereal if you were lucky enough to get to the kitchen before Marcus, who could polish off a whole box of Frosted Flakes if left unsupervised. But dinners were sacred. Five-thirty sharp, everyone at the table, phones in the kitchen basket, television off.

The dinner table was where I learned most about being part of something bigger than myself. Conversations bounced between English and Spanish and Creole, between school gossip and work stories and plans for the weekend. Mrs. Du Bois orchestrated it all like a conductor, making sure everyone got heard, redirecting arguments before they could escalate, celebrating small victories with the enthusiasm they deserved.

""Elena got an A on her history test,"" she might announce, and we'd all applaud like she'd won an Olympic medal.

""James scored two goals at soccer practice,"" Mr. Du Bois would add, and James would grin and duck his head, embarrassed but pleased.

I was quiet those first few months, still learning the rhythm of it all, but gradually I began to contribute. A story about something funny that happened in ESL class. A question about homework. Eventually, opinions about which movie we should watch on Friday night.

The movie selection process was democracy at its messiest. Each kid got to make a case for their choice, and then we'd vote. The campaigns could get intense. Elena, who loved romantic comedies, would promise to make popcorn with extra butter. Marcus, who preferred action movies, would threaten to hide the remote if his choice didn't win. James lobbied hard for superhero movies, while Sarah pushed for psychological thrillers that gave the younger kids nightmares.

I usually voted with the majority, still learning to assert preferences, still amazed that my opinion mattered enough to be counted. But one Friday night, about six months after I'd arrived, I surprised everyone, including myself.

""I want to pick this time,"" I said, pointing to a movie I'd seen advertised on television.

It was The Lion King‚Äîanimated, about family and belonging and finding your place in the world. Everyone looked at me, then at the movie case, then back at me.

""You sure?"" Marcus asked. ""It's kind of young for you.""

""I'm sure,"" I said, with more confidence than I felt.

And that's how I learned that sometimes speaking up gets you exactly what you need, even when you don't know you need it. Watching Simba lose his father and find his way home, I felt something loosen in my chest‚Äîgrief I didn't know I was carrying, recognition of a story that felt like mine, even in cartoon form.

Mrs. Du Bois noticed me wiping my eyes during the sad parts and didn't say anything, just moved closer on the couch so our shoulders touched. After the movie, when everyone else had gone to bed, she stayed to help me clean up the popcorn bowls.

""Good choice tonight,"" she said.

""It made me sad,"" I admitted.

""Sometimes the best movies do that. Sometimes we need to be sad about things before we can feel better about them.""

I nodded, not fully understanding but trusting that she did.

""Do you ever think about your parents?"" she asked gently. ""Your first parents, I mean.""

It was the first time anyone had asked me directly. I'd been waiting for this question, dreading it, but also somehow needing it.

""Sometimes,"" I said. ""But I can't remember them very well.""

""That's okay. Sometimes remembering isn't as important as knowing you were loved.""

""How do I know that?""

""Because you know how to love,"" she said simply. ""Nobody learns that on their own. Someone taught you, even if you can't remember the lessons.""

That night, lying in bed with the teardrop nightlight casting its gentle glow, I thought about love as a language I'd learned before I could even speak English. The hands that had held me in Ethiopia, the voices that had sung to me, the care that had kept me alive long enough to make it to this house, this family, this moment.

I was still that Ethiopian boy, I realized. But I was also becoming something new‚Äîan American kid with a complicated history and a present full of people who chose to love me every day.

The sounds of the house settling around me had become familiar: Mr. Du Bois checking locks downstairs, Mrs. Du Bois moving quietly through the hall making sure everyone was covered and comfortable, the old radiator clicking as it warmed the room, Elena talking in her sleep in rapid Spanish.

These were the sounds of family, I thought. Not just blood calling to blood, but choice calling to choice, love calling to love, home calling to the people brave enough to answer.

Outside, it had started to snow again‚Äîthe second winter snow I'd ever seen, but not nearly as miraculous as the first. This time, I wasn't pressed against the window watching in wonder. This time, I was inside looking out, warm and safe and belonging to something bigger than myself.

This time, I was home.





# Part II: Growing Into Myself

# Chapter 4: Uniforms and Undercurrents

By age thirteen, I had grown tall swiftly‚Äîarms and cheekbones sprawling, trying to fold myself into desks not meant for me. I discovered unwritten rules everywhere: how to speak, whom to speak to, and what not to say.

Middle school was a different universe from elementary school. The hallways stretched longer, the lockers slammed louder, and the social dynamics shifted daily like tectonic plates. One day you were sitting with the right people at lunch; the next day those same people acted like you were invisible.

I navigated it all with what I thought was ambivalent grace. I smiled when necessary, listened always, made people laugh when I wanted to, and faded into the background when I didn't. The locker hall felt like a stage where everyone was performing a version of themselves they thought other people wanted to see.

The private Catholic school I attended had uniforms‚Äînavy slacks, white button-down shirts, navy blazers with the school crest embroidered on the pocket. In theory, the uniforms were supposed to eliminate class differences, make everyone equal. In practice, they just shifted the markers of status to subtler things: the quality of your shoes, whether your blazer was tailored or bought off the rack, how you tied your tie, whether you rolled your sleeves or kept them buttoned.

I learned to read these signals like a new language. The way Brandon's loafers were always perfectly polished spoke of money and attention to detail. The way Miguel's blazer sleeves were a little too long suggested hand-me-downs and making do. The way Ashley always had a fresh manicure told you her family valued appearance in ways my foster family didn't think about.

But I also learned that none of it mattered as much as I thought it did. What mattered was kindness, humor, loyalty, authenticity‚Äîqualities that couldn't be purchased or inherited, only practiced.

I had friends, but only in fragments. Boys who cracked jokes during lunch but avoided me around certain crowds. Girls I didn't really talk to yet, but who smiled when we passed in the hall. I didn't mind, not really. The conversations mattered in the moment, and I lived for those moments.

There was Leon, who shared sour candy in the science lab and endlessly talked about building a hovercraft. He had thick glasses and a mind that moved faster than his mouth could keep up with. During chemistry class, while everyone else was carefully following the lab instructions, Leon would whisper conspiracy theories about what would happen if we mixed unauthorized chemicals.

""You know,"" he'd say, adjusting his safety goggles, ""if we added just a little bit of...""

""Leon,"" I'd interrupt, ""do you want to blow up the school?""

""Not the whole school,"" he'd clarify. ""Just this wing. Maybe just this room.""

He never actually mixed anything dangerous, but he kept me entertained with possibilities that made even titration experiments feel like adventures.

Lena was different‚Äîquiet where Leon was chatty, careful where he was reckless. She sat behind me in English class and had a voice that made my stomach flutter when she raised her hand to answer questions. She once held my hand on the bleachers during a basketball game, and I thought about that moment for weeks afterward‚Äîthe warmth of her palm, the way she didn't pull away, how the whole gymnasium seemed to fade into background noise.

But teenage relationships were complicated by layers I was still learning to recognize. There were the friends who were friends in all settings, and the friends who were friends only in certain contexts. There were the conversations that happened easily in small groups but died in larger ones. There were the invisible rules about who could date whom, who could sit where, who belonged and who didn't.

I was learning that being adopted made me interesting to some people and suspicious to others. Some kids were fascinated by my story‚Äîthe parts I was willing to share, anyway. They asked questions with the kind of wide-eyed curiosity usually reserved for zoo animals or foreign exchange students.

""What was it like in Africa?"" they'd ask, as if Africa was a single place with a single experience.

""Hot,"" I'd usually answer, which was true but not particularly enlightening.

Other kids seemed to think my adoption meant I was somehow less legitimate, like I was playing dress-up in a life that didn't really belong to me. They never said it directly, but I could feel it in the way they talked about their ""real"" families, emphasizing the word real just a little too much.

Anthony was different. He knew about complicated families because he was complicated too. His father had been deported when Anthony was eleven, and his mother worked three jobs to keep their apartment. Anthony understood that family wasn't always simple, that belonging wasn't always guaranteed, that sometimes you had to work harder to prove you deserved the space you occupied.

We became friends during detention, of all places. I'd been caught passing notes in history class (a note from Elena asking me to tell her boyfriend she was sick and couldn't meet him after school‚Äîmiddle school drama at its finest). Anthony had been caught reading a comic book under his desk during math.

""What's your story?"" he asked as we sat in the classroom writing ""I will pay attention in class"" one hundred times each.

""Long or short version?"" I replied.

""We've got time,"" he said, gesturing to the stack of paper in front of us.

So I told him the short version: Ethiopian orphan, refugee camp, adoption, Pennsylvania. He nodded like it made perfect sense, like everyone had stories that started in one place and continued in another.

Then he told me his: born in Philadelphia, father deported for immigration violations, family scattered, mother working multiple jobs to pay rent, dreams of college feeling impossibly distant.

""People think my story is sad,"" he said. ""But it's not sad. It's just complicated.""

That became our friendship motto: It's not sad, it's just complicated. We applied it to everything‚Äîfailed tests, unrequited crushes, family dynamics, the general unfairness of being thirteen years old in a world designed by and for adults.

Anthony introduced me to other kids whose stories were complicated too. Maria, whose parents spoke no English and who translated everything from report cards to phone calls. Kevin, who lived with his grandmother because his mother couldn't take care of him. Jasmine, who was brilliant but whose teachers never seemed to notice because she was quiet and didn't fit their expectations of what smart looked like.

Together, we created our own small ecosystem within the larger social universe of middle school. We ate lunch together when possible, studied together when necessary, and provided each other with the kind of understanding that can only come from shared experience of not quite fitting in.

But even within our group, I sometimes felt like I was performing. The Ethiopian part of my identity was exotic enough to be interesting but distant enough to be safe. Nobody asked hard questions about trauma or loss or what it felt like to live between two worlds. I was the kid with the interesting origin story, not the kid who still sometimes woke up from dreams he couldn't remember, speaking words in a language he'd forgotten.

The truth was more complicated than I was ready to share. I was grateful for my adoption, loved my new family, felt blessed to have opportunities I never would have had otherwise. But I was also angry sometimes‚Äîat circumstances I couldn't control, at losses I couldn't articulate, at the way people expected me to be grateful all the time instead of just allowing me to be human.

I was learning that identity was layered, that you could be thankful and resentful simultaneously, that belonging was something you earned gradually rather than something you received all at once.

One afternoon, walking home from school with Anthony, he asked me something no one else had asked.

""Do you ever wish things had been different? Like, that you could have stayed in Ethiopia with your original family?""

I thought about it for a long time before answering.

""Sometimes,"" I said finally. ""Not because I don't love my family now, but because I wonder who I would have been. Like, there's a version of me that grew up there, and I'll never know what he was like.""

Anthony nodded. ""I think about that too. Like, there's a version of me where my dad never got deported, where my mom didn't have to work so much, where college felt possible. But then I think‚Äîmaybe that version of me wouldn't be as strong as this version.""

""Maybe,"" I said. ""Or maybe he'd be strong in different ways.""

""It's not sad,"" Anthony said.

""Just complicated,"" I finished.

That evening at dinner, Mrs. Du Bois asked how school was, the way she asked every evening. Usually I gave the standard answer: ""Fine."" But that night I found myself telling her about my conversation with Anthony, about the complexity of gratitude mixed with loss.

""That makes perfect sense,"" she said. ""You can love the life you have and still grieve the life you lost. Those feelings don't cancel each other out.""

""Really?""

""Really. Humans are big enough to hold contradictory emotions. In fact, I think the people who can hold contradictions are often the wisest people.""

Mr. Du Bois, who had been quietly eating his meatloaf, looked up. ""You know what I've learned in twenty years of fostering kids? The ones who ask the hard questions usually turn out okay. It's the ones who pretend everything's fine that worry me.""

I looked around the table at my siblings‚Äîsome biological, some adopted, some fostered, all family. Elena was picking at her vegetables while texting under the table. Marcus was already on his second helping of everything. James was arranging his food into perfect geometric patterns.

""Am I turning out okay?"" I asked.

Mrs. Du Bois smiled. ""Sweetheart, you're turning out exactly like you're supposed to.""

That night, lying in bed, I thought about the multiple versions of myself that existed simultaneously: the Ethiopian boy I'd been, the American teenager I was becoming, the son and brother and friend I was learning to be. None of them were false. All of them were true.

It wasn't sad. It was just complicated. And the complicated, I was learning were perfectly fine.

# Chapter 5: The Weight of Expectations

When I transferred to the public vocational high school at fifteen, all those pieces scattered. Elijah stopped texting. Lena moved away. Anthony got suspended for something he swore he didn't do but couldn't prove his innocence. Only a few stragglers remained close‚Äîtwo boys I played basketball with after church, and a girl from choir who brought me mango juice on my birthday. These friendships weren't loud, but they endured.

The decision to transfer was easy. The religious school was expensive, and with five kids in school simultaneously, the Du Bois family budget was stretched thin. But more than that,¬†

‚ÄúI want to learn how to fix things. Build things. Make things work.""

Mr. Du Bois, who had spent his career as an electrician before moving into management, understood immediately. ""There's honor in trade work,"" he said. ""Good money too, if you're skilled. And there's always going to be demand‚Äîpeople always need things fixed.""

So I made the switch. Vocational school was a different world entirely. Gone were the chapel uniforms and essays on ancient Rome. Instead, I encountered wrenches, copper coils, Ohm's Law, and lab work where mistakes sparked or leaked or sometimes exploded in small, educational ways.

The student body was different too. More diverse in some ways, less diverse in others. More kids from working-class families, fewer college-bound overachievers. More hands-on learners, fewer bookworms. The social dynamics were simpler but also rougher‚Äîless passive aggression, more direct confrontation.

I chose HVAC‚Äîheating, ventilation, and air conditioning‚Äîpartly because it seemed practical and partly because I liked the idea of working with systems that made people comfortable. There was something appealing about being the person who could make a hot day bearable or a cold day warm.

My teacher, Mr. Delgado, was a compact man with hands that looked like they'd been carved from wood‚Äîscarred, weathered, but incredibly precise. He'd been working in HVAC for thirty years before coming to teach, and he brought a kind of practical wisdom that couldn't be found in textbooks.

""HVAC isn't just about machines,"" he told us on the first day. ""It's about comfort. People cry when the AC breaks in July. They panic when the heat goes out in January. You're not just fixing equipment‚Äîyou're restoring peace of mind.""

I never forgot that. It changed how I thought about the work, elevated it from technical problem-solving to something more like service, care, healing.

The coursework was divided between classroom learning and hands-on practice. We learned about thermodynamics and electrical circuits and refrigeration cycles. We studied building codes and safety regulations and customer service protocols. But we also spent hours in the workshop, taking apart units, diagnosing problems, getting our hands dirty with real equipment.

I excelled in the written tests but it was the practical work that really engaged me. There was something deeply satisfying about troubleshooting a malfunctioning system, identifying the problem, and implementing a solution that worked. Unlike academic subjects where success was measured by grades on papers, here success was binary: either the system worked or it didn't.

My classmates were a mix of kids like me‚Äîsuburban foster kids looking for practical skills‚Äîand rural kids whose families had been in trades for generations. There was Tommy, whose father and grandfather were both plumbers, who'd been fixing leaky faucets since he was eight. There was Maria, one of only three girls in our program, whose mother cleaned office buildings and who was determined to make enough money to buy her a house. There was David, who'd dropped out of college after one semester and was starting over, chasing a career that felt more concrete than the philosophy degree he'd been pursuing.

We bonded over shared frustration with broken equipment, celebrated each other's successes, and developed the kind of easy camaraderie that comes from working together toward common goals. The hierarchy here wasn't based on family background or test scores, but on skill, work ethic, and willingness to help others learn.

Mr. Delgado noticed my progress early on. ""You've got good hands,"" he told me after I successfully diagnosed a tricky electrical issue that had stumped several other students. ""And you think through problems instead of just throwing parts at them. That's going to serve you well.""

But it wasn't just the technical skills I was learning. Vocational school taught me about different kinds of intelligence, different ways of being smart. The kid who struggled with algebra could look at a compressor and immediately identify why it wasn't running efficiently. The girl who'd never been good at English could explain complex refrigeration cycles with perfect clarity.
