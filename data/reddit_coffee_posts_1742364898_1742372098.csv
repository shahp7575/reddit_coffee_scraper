AITA for outing something she did to another friend upsetting them and being too close to my friends boyfriend to give ammunition? *crazy story*,"
Okay so maybe get your cup of tea and biscuits for this one ...

Okay so myself (31F) and my former best friend (32F), let's call her Amy were like sisters. Then things went strangely wrong and then alarmingly.

So firstly, this girl was like my sister... I loved her and my sons saw her as their aunt. We had been single mothers together and supported each other a lot especially after I escaped a really bad dv situation. I thought she could never do anything wrong to me and we were really connected especially as we started doing tarot together and set up a little buisness. It made sense as we were always on the phone, hours every day and barely went a few hours without speaking. Our friends joked we were married and couldn't be apart long.

Things started to go wrong when she stopped pulling her weight in the buisness. I worked constantly to the point in made me ill yet she never did anything near as much if at all most weeks.I was live 5 to 6 nights a week doing readings on tiktok as well as crating resin art with spirtual and tarot themes, candles and charm pots plus nore...after working all day and having the kids all evening yet she would never join lives and left It to me after the first 2 months. Eventually I met someone through the lives who I came to start a relationship with, let's call him Ian, we became close after he helped moderate my lives and promote the business. He even made a new logo on Amy's demands (i let her have her say to appease her and keot my input minimal) yet he also felt she didn't work where as i was constantly live, promoting, making videos or talking and arranging clients as well as producing stock. Amy did nothing accept order crysyals that took her from February all the way to November to put on the website.

Her and Ian were friendly too and I never thought anything of it. I trusted her and fell in love with him. He suddenly started being cold with me when we spoke hours every day (he lived a couple hours away) and were usually really happy to speak and were planning a future. Amy then suddenly became less communicative and he broke up with me on the Tuesday and by the Thursday she suddenly needed 'space' and time to herself. From talking everyday for hours, i suddenly couldnt text or call her. It was atrange and like we fell out without a fall out yet she needed space like i did something wrong. Me and him were still speaking and I was hoping to reconcile but he kept being really cruel and saying I needed to be independent and not need Amy and and should be 'alone'. He kept telling me repeatedly to be alone and berated me for a week whilst I heard nothing of Amy. My other friends thought it was strange especially as Ian confirmed they still spoke.

Eventually time moved on and he left the picture and Amy reappeared apologetic but blaming Ian and how he impacted our friendship as she didn't like him and felt pushed out. She admitted she'd not defended me as hes spoke bad of me and I did question if anything happened yet she said no. This was in August.

Fast forward to October, AMy still had not participated in a live and was expecting to share private readings and earn 30 pounds (half) for a client after doing no work to get them and participating minimally as i did the main tarot reading and she supported m with a pendulum or occasional oracle cards. I was working so hard and kept asking for help. Eventually after months and months I snapped especially when my son eith special needs was heavily disregulated and i was struggling alone with him. I was working hours everyday and she wasn't doing anything and kept saying ""we'd pull it back later"" or she'd do other things than the live but didn't do much accept edit the website suddenly to a completely different colour scheme that was deemed a 'bad myspace' look by other friends and customers. I was so frustrated. I worked all day and she only worked mornings and hard a partner. I tried to meet in the middle after she blamed me for doing too much off ny own back, so I asked her to craft candles whilst I carried on the resin crafts and lives but could she make videos as well. Nothing changed abd Eventually I snapped and bluntly started asking what are you doing business wise today? And saying what needed to be done that day so what could she do? Thus began the almighty downfall...

She began to get distant and hard to get in touch with. She wouldn't hang out as friends and did very minimal posts and a tiny rarely made handful of tiktoks. Of course Still wouldn't go live and share reading work. I was never nasty but I was becoming ill from overworking. She denied not working despite taking months off and never participating in readings. I eventually had enough totally after she finally came on a live for the first time in months and suddenly left embarassingly after 20 minutes. I said it was unprofessional and her excuse was her partner came home yet I didn't feel that was enough of a reason given they had a whole house and it had been promoted over a week and our first together live in 6 months. I said I was also worried for her as she wouldn't socialise and I wanted to spend time with her even for a quick coffee and I was her only real friend and it was so distant. I felt bad afterwards but I tried to say it concerned as she barely left house and was constantly smoking the green kind.She responded by ignoring me before eventually saying ""no point in hanging out for 2 hours"" and she did want to be in the buisness but couldn't do more than 2 lives yet then messaged my friend Hayley across the street for a coffee ü§î

After this she left the business by her own choice. I asked her to stay but she wouldn't. I oractically begged stupidly and keot apologsing. Prior to this i had spent days chasing her as we had a fayre and she would instantly read messages then take hours to respond or answer for me to decide for her and not help. She stopped ringing me when she rang constantly daily for years before and now I couldn't speak to her. I didn't have her stock of crysyals and I spent hours making up for the stock crafting necklaces etc She bluntly messaged she was out and her sister and boyfriend sent me nasty messages. I tried to stay her friend but she ignored me. She decided to sell her crystals and I promoted her business on my website with links yet she blocked me from seeing it personally. I tried so hard to be nice and I sent her son a Christmas present yet she ignored me still. I left the door open to be friends but she wasnt interested and then she decided to make my life hell. I even still promoted her new crystal business on my website for weeks after and recommended her still even when she blocked me and started spam commenting my other friends tiktok then blocking her and other little strange games.I just wanted to try be a good person and keep my karma clean.

It all really started a couple of weeks later when she went into my old place of work and approached a friend to say we had fallen out and other things and this was then relayed to my mother out of concern. I brushed it off and asked her not to do this and just not discuss me as I didn't want drama and wanted us both to be happy especially as we were so close people were shocked we werent close. This continued to escalate despite me never doing anything to her. It was just mean girl things at first... posts cutting me out of memories, messaging my friends she only knew and saw through me (yes red flag I was her only real friend) and then she Eventually stole from my PayPal that was previously shared. It was only 15 pounds but was Petty. Then it got serious. She reached out to my close friend who lived opposite we will call shelly, who is pretty temperamental. She told her a littany if lies including I hit my child, the kids are scared of me and I was having a 4 year affair with our other neighbour across the road who I'd been friends with well over a decade and his Mrs was my bestfriend who Amy asked for coffee... we will call her Hayley and him Tom.

Shelley stormed in my house one night after ignoring me for weeks to accuse me of this affair. I was beyond shocked. I Eventually convinced her of the truth that we were just friends and I wouldn't do that to Hayley. I also pointed out id just kept to myself and wasnt talking about Amy or making any drama and focusing on the buisness, I hadnt actually said anything bad about her her or said wed fallen out to people. A week later I went around and we had a drink and she apologised properly. The lies all came out including that Amy and Ian has been 'inappropriately messaging'but only so Amy could 'prove'i couldn't trust him. I just said I found it funny as it was the first I heard of this proof. I brushed it off hurt but didn't react as I'd already blocked Amy after a month of her games of blocking unblocking and slagging me off. I didn't want the drama and I believed in karma. My main concern was the lies I had hit my child and shelly Amy and Amy's sister had been in some sort of group chat constantly slagging me off for weeks. I was hurt but just wanted to move on and forgave shelly.

Next thing I saw my friend who is friends with Hayley. They had a another friend poppy who they were going to dinnner with later and somehow Amy had befriended her and managed an invite from her. I knew more drama and lies were coming and I told Hayley about the accusations and she laughed it off. She found it ridiculous. The meal happened and Amy seemed to behave but my 2 friends weren't keen on her and saw it all as 'games' and had no intention of seeing her again. I thought it may have been finally over but 2 days later my phone blew up with nasty texts from Hayley and calls (I blocked her on everything but text as we never spoke that way and forgot) accusing me of ringing the police on her off a welfare check which would have been an issue due to all the illegal green stuff she always has in the house. I still dont know if this really happened or just more lies. I told her clearly I hadn't and to leave me alone ... I hadn't rang the police just like I don't hit my child. Shelly then messaged me saying Amy messaged her calling her a liar (I never named shelley) and she'd never said I hit my children. I confirmed with the police I never rang them and forwarded on the email to Amy and as she had blocked Shelley, I thought it was done.

Nope it just got worse.

The next day, my door was nearly kicked in by a very angry Hayley. We were terrified as didn't know who it was initially so I hid upstairs with the kids and then heard her screaming I was a 'slag'. It turns out the lovely Amy had been to visit Poppy to show her 'screenshots' of my affair. And wow these were fake screenshots... turns out its very easy to do. They were insane! There was dirty conversations between myself and Hayley's partner that never happened and were just crazy. Hayley blinded by rage and without checking threw her partner out and all my friends stopped speaking to me. Hayley is incredibly volatile angry which Amy new and takes a long time to calm. She's lovely 90% of the time but angry Hayley is quite scary similarly to the known temper of Shelley who can be violent.

Weirdly, Hayley and her partner had previously set me up with his brother. We had a thing on an off for a few months a couple of years ago and still in touch. Brother works with police and is extremely intelligent thus checked my phone to disprove the so called screnshots and confirm the truth. It was violating having my ex read years of conversations including things about Ian and even things I'd said To my friends about him at the time. He confirmed I was telling the truth but Hayley was busy telling me to go die and everyone else had iced me out so I didn't know what to do. I had nasty posts on my business page and messages and all over a guy who was just a friend!

This is where I may be the Ahole. After all this, things didnt ease up and there were posts of my business page and many abnoymous reports I snapped. I didn't want my business ruined or people reading publically on Facebook via Tom's business page or mine that I was a wh**e specially when it was beyond rational that I would ever have been possible to have such a long standing affair with Tom and never would. I sought legal advice who told me not to retaliate (I wasn't going to but Amy had many many skeletons including lots of cheating stories and was obsessed with accusing others of cheating) and that I could look to send a cease and desist letter at cost and look to an Injunction and even damages case. I sent a message (my first one! ) on a group chat including the metal friend, hayley and Amy (mutual hadn't blocked so I could) I fairly stated it needed to stop. I was civil but in my rage I did say Amy needed to stop as it it went to court everything she's said would be outed including the 3 potential fathers of her child and that she'd accused Shellys partner of cheating which I new was a lie then as I do now. I firmly said I would involve the police and sent the cctv of Hayley trying to smash into my home and damging my back door and breaking my clothes Airers. I then left the group and hoped that would be ir after I stated I would press charges on everyone if it didn't stop. I hadn't done anything to anyone and wasn't messaging anyone. This was true. I didn't react to anyone. However Shelley rang me aggressively saying when had was her partner meant to have hit on Amy ... I told her the story that apparently he drove to see her and made a 'move'in the car. She called me a liar and said she'd spoke to Amy who already told her the story and was just saying he drove irrationally. I said firmly how could she know to tell that exact story before anyone even spoke to me if she never told me it saying he tried to cheat and I was lying ? It was clear as day she lied but shelley blocked me and Bow is vestiges with Amy. Shelleys partner rang upset and told me not apologise but why did I bring him into it. I said I'm sorry I picked an example upset of her lies thinking it would stop her acting more when she realised I could tell everyone the mass of lie she tells. He was upset but we agreed to be civil. I feel horrible about that. It was the first time I reacted and didn't think. I was so upset and I had been isolated and attacked for months and scared my business would be ruined.

A few days ago Hayley asked to speak to me after 8 days since she screamed and attacked my door. Finally calmly we spoke and she believed me . I explained about Amy's behaviour and what has been happening. I also explained I don't think I'd be set up by my ""lover"" To date his brother and so on. She did however think that before we were friends that I was too close with her partner and when I escaped dv I leaned on him too much and she felt it was an 'emotional affair'. I accepted this an apologised . There was never any sexual intent and I was laone on a newly built street with him as my only friend close by who understood as we both had PTSD. I didn't mean to cross any line and life had moved on years since and I was so close to Hayley and me and him had drifted apart. Hayley and I have began speaking again and (touch wood) Amy has gone silent.

Currently Hayley and our mutual friend are speaking to me atm again not quite normally but getting there. Hayley's partner is still kicked out and due to other issues she doesn't know what to do or if she wants him home. She did confirm though that Amy and Ian did have something happen between them and a lot more than texting. I didn't want to hear the exact details but now I know Amy ruined my relationship, didn't work and quit the business to then bully me and try isolate me. She seemed to want to take my friends and have my boyfriend when she has her own partner and my friends were friendly to her too but not actual friends by her lack of effort over several years.I can never ever get why or understand as still I have done nothing to her. After Hayley and I spoke in person, we spoke again a few days later and Shelly saw. Suddenly Amy unsent over a hundred messages and said she no longer wanted to be involved. Touch would things are quiet but Tom and Hayley still aren't back together and I no longer speak to Tom as not to upset Hayley. Shelly just gives me dirty looks and ignores me and i feel I can breathe again but still so hurt.

I can't take anymore drama. I've probably missed bits but I think that is the key breakdown and I will update.

AITA in this ? Did I deserve this for being too close to my guy friend in a difficult time and for upsetting Shelly and her partner bybusing them as an exanple of Amy's lies? It just all seems crazy and like a bad episode of shameless in a remote village.

I would genuinely appreciate any input. Thankyou amazing people",2,1742371733.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

1jes1fp,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1jes1fp/is_laughland_teeth_whitening_worth_it_my/,Is Laughland Teeth Whitening Worth It? My Experience After 6 Days,"# Why I Gave Laughland Teeth Whitening a Try

I‚Äôve been wanting to whiten my teeth for a while, but I didn‚Äôt want to drop hundreds of dollars at the dentist. I‚Äôve tried whitening strips in the past, but they always left my teeth feeling sensitive, and the results weren‚Äôt that great. Whitening toothpaste? Barely made a difference.

So when I heard about **Laughland teeth whitening**, I was curious. It‚Äôs supposed to be **dentist-formulated** and uses **an LED mouthpiece** to activate the whitening gel, which sounded more advanced than strips. I figured I‚Äôd try it for a week and see if it actually made a difference.

Here‚Äôs how it went.

# What‚Äôs in the Laughland Teeth Whitening Kit?

When I opened the package, I was relieved to see that it wasn‚Äôt overly complicated. The kit includes:

* **Whitening Gel Pens** ‚Äì A simple applicator to apply the gel directly to your teeth.
* **LED Mouthpiece** ‚Äì This is supposed to activate the whitening process.
* **Clear Instructions** ‚Äì Straightforward and easy to follow.

No messy trays, no complicated prep. Just apply the gel, turn on the light, and wait.

# How I Used It

The whole whitening session takes **10 minutes a day**, so it wasn‚Äôt a huge time commitment.

1. **Brushed and dried my teeth** to make sure the gel would stick properly.
2. **Applied the gel** with the pen, making sure to cover each tooth.
3. **Inserted the LED mouthpiece** and let it do its thing for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinsed and cleaned** the mouthpiece for the next use.

One thing I liked was that **the gel didn‚Äôt have a weird chemical taste**. Some whitening products taste awful, but this one was mild.

# My Results After 6 Days

* **Day 1:** No immediate difference, but my teeth felt extra clean.
* **Day 3:** I noticed the yellowish tint on my teeth starting to fade.
* **Day 6:** My teeth were **noticeably whiter, probably 6-7 shades brighter**. The difference was natural-looking, not overly bright or fake.

The best part? **No sensitivity.** I was expecting some discomfort, but my teeth felt completely normal.

# How Laughland Compares to Other Whitening Methods

* **Whitening Strips** ‚Äì They work, but they always left my teeth sensitive, and the results were uneven.
* **Whitening Toothpaste** ‚Äì Good for maintenance but didn‚Äôt do much for deeper stains.
* **Professional Whitening** ‚Äì Definitely the most effective, but way too expensive for me.

Laughland felt like **a solid in-between option**‚Äîmore effective than strips but much cheaper than a dentist visit.

# FAQs About Laughland Teeth Whitening

1. **Does it damage enamel?** ‚Äì No, the gel is designed to be gentle while removing stains.
2. **Does it work on deep stains?** ‚Äì Yes, I saw a big improvement in coffee and tea stains.
3. **How long do results last?** ‚Äì With good oral care, they should last several months.

# Tips for the Best Results

* **Use it daily** ‚Äì Skipping days slows down results.
* **Avoid staining foods** ‚Äì Coffee, tea, and red wine can slow the whitening process.
* **Brush and floss regularly** ‚Äì Helps maintain a brighter smile.

# Final Thoughts ‚Äì Is Laughland Worth It?

For me, **Laughland teeth whitening actually worked**. It didn‚Äôt give me blinding white results overnight, but after six days, my teeth were noticeably whiter. The best part was that I didn‚Äôt have to deal with sensitivity, which has always been a dealbreaker for me with other whitening products.

Would I recommend it over professional whitening? Probably not if you want extreme results. But if you‚Äôre looking for **an easy, effective, and affordable way to brighten your teeth**, this might be worth considering.

I woke up with a text from someone who wasn't in my contact list . It was like Hello and I said it back and then he went ahead to talk as though we knew eachother.

Etiquette is something I really value and seeing this boy ignoring the normal way someone learned should start a conversation I asked him who he was.. He then goes like"" oops my bad kwani my number isn't saved? You gave me your number tukiwa kwa mat sometimes back"" 
Immediately I knew he was lying because if I gave someone my number I would definitely remember.. secondly I changed numbers like a week ago meaning if I'd given him my number it should be the old one. Then I like information..As a normal Kenyan I sent him 1 bob and still his name didn't ring a bell.I wanted to know how he got my number but he remained with his stupid narrative.  Then I told him he shouldn't have texted me . To my surprise he goes like "" No we should have coffee in the evening? ""

I'm single so I say why not..He schedules it to 5pm in the evening and that was cool with me. I was the one to choose the meeting place

Now here's the part that pissed me.. 5pm arrives no communication  then boom its 7pm my phone beeps..I pick up and its him.. he tells me place ako kunanyesha so I wait kiasi . I'm completely okay with it.  8pm he calls.. we have a small talk and at that point obviously I wasn't gonna go meet him ..I have my own rules.. 

During this call I insist on how he got my number and he finally says he was given by someone who knows me but he can't say who . I ask why was he given and he says that he was coming for a field trip and wanted accommodation so the person told him they won't be around and they gave him my number and told him I will accommodate him at my place..

RIGHT? Or so I was convinced to think. Fortunately I passed it one year later and got into college, to which he was not very happy about because we won‚Äôt be spending that much time together, but he agreed to let me go in the end, but he was never supportive about it, or in general.
In this period of time a few major things happened: him commenting on how big my cousin‚Äôs breast are, and watching porn, watching a specific actress to be more precise, an actress who is the complete oposite of me. I think this created some self image issues in my mind because I couldn‚Äôt see myself as an attractive person anymore.

His mom always tries to put me down witg mean comments, but his dad is quite nice, doesn‚Äôt talk to me much and that‚Äôs fine by me because I‚Äôm a massive introvert.

After this he convinced me that my friends are not really my friends and I estranged myself from them.

1jeryyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoCodeCommunity/comments/1jeryyd/figma_to_webflow/,Figma to Webflow,"From Pixels to Web: Mastering the Figma to Webflow Workflow

Hey there, designers and developers! If you've been looking for ways to speed up your web design process, you've probably heard about the Figma to Webflow connection. Both tools are powerhouses in their own right, but when combined, they create a workflow that can seriously transform how you build websites.

I've spent countless hours working with both platforms, and I want to share what I've learned about moving designs from Figma into fully-functional Webflow sites. So grab a coffee, get comfortable, and let's jump into the world of modern web design workflows.

# What Are Figma and Webflow Anyway?

Before we dive into the integration, let's make sure we're on the same page about what these tools actually do.

# Figma: Design's Collaborative Canvas

**Figma** is a cloud-based design tool that's changed how teams work on interface design. Unlike older design software, Figma lets multiple people work together in real-time on the same file - no more sending files back and forth or dealing with version conflicts!

Some standout Figma features include:

* Real-time collaboration capabilities
* Vector editing and prototyping tools
* A user interface that's fairly intuitive to learn
* Plugins that extend functionality
* Version history that saves your work
* Works across different operating systems
* Connects well with other design and development tools

# Webflow: Where Design Meets Development

**Webflow** is a visual web design and development platform that bridges the gap between designers and developers. Instead of writing code manually, you build websites visually while Webflow generates clean, production-ready code behind the scenes.

Webflow's key features include:

* Visual design interface that outputs professional code
* Built-in hosting and publishing options
* Powerful CMS for dynamic content
* Responsive design tools for all screen sizes
* SEO tools built right in
* E-commerce functionality
* Interaction and animation capabilities without coding
* Team collaboration features

# Why Combine Figma and Webflow?

You might be wondering: ""Can't I just design directly in Webflow?"" or ""Why not code from my Figma designs?""

These are fair questions. The truth is you absolutely could skip the Figma-to-Webflow workflow. But here's why many professionals don't:

1. **Specialized tools for specialized jobs** \- Figma excels at design exploration and iteration, while Webflow is built for bringing designs to life as actual websites.
2. **Faster ideation and approval** \- Getting design concepts approved in Figma is typically much quicker than building them in Webflow first.
3. **Team workflow advantages** \- Designers can work in their preferred environment (Figma) while developers or Webflow experts can handle the implementation.
4. **Design system consistency** \- Creating a design system in Figma and then transferring it to Webflow helps maintain visual consistency.
5. **Client presentations** \- Figma provides a cleaner environment for presenting initial designs to clients before investing time in Webflow development.

# The Figma to Webflow Plugin: A Game-Changer

In 2022, Webflow introduced their official Figma to Webflow plugin, and it's been a big deal for designers and developers who use both platforms. The plugin was built by Webflow Labs specifically to make the transition between design and development more seamless.

# What the Plugin Actually Does

The Figma to Webflow plugin allows you to:

* Export Figma layers directly to Webflow components and elements
* Transfer Figma variables to Webflow variables
* Convert Figma text and effect styles to Webflow classes
* Copy and paste Figma layers as elements in Webflow
* Sync your design system between platforms

This means you can maintain consistency between your design files and your actual website, saving tons of time and reducing the chances of implementation errors.

# Common Challenges (And How to Overcome Them)

Despite the plugin's helpful features, the journey from Figma to Webflow isn't always smooth sailing. Let's talk about some common issues people face and how to deal with them.

# The Auto Layout Conundrum

One of the most common frustrations comes from auto layout in Figma.

*""So basically I have been wireframing my MVP idea in both mobile version and desktop version. Now I saw that there was a plugin to export directly into webflow and I was blown away. Now, to select a certain frame, one has to have the whole frame in auto-layout mode, otherwise it cannot be exported.""*

The problem? When you convert existing designs to auto layout, things often shift around and mess up your carefully positioned elements.

**Solution:** Don't try to convert completed designs to auto layout all at once. Either:

1. Design with auto layout from the beginning, or
2. Create a fresh copy of your design and rebuild it section by section with auto layout

*""You don't auto-layout the whole page in one go, you auto-layout each item like in Flexbox! By column or by rows.""*

# Class Duplication Issues

Another problem that more advanced Webflow users encounter is class duplication. The plugin often creates new classes for each element, resulting in class names like ""Button 42"" or ""Section Wrapper 228"" instead of using a more efficient system of combo classes.

**Solution:** Plan to clean up your classes in Webflow after import. While this adds an extra step, it's still faster than building everything from scratch.

# Responsive Design Limitations

The plugin transfers designs as they appear in Figma, but websites need to be responsive across different screen sizes.

**Solution:** Use Figma's auto layout with responsive properties in mind, then fine-tune the responsive behavior in Webflow. Consider creating designs for multiple breakpoints in Figma before exporting.

# Setting Up Your Figma File for Webflow Success

If you want your Figma to Webflow workflow to be smooth, you need to set up your Figma files correctly from the start. Here's how to do it right:

# 1. Plan Before You Design

Before jumping into Figma, outline the structure of your project. Think about:

* Site structure and page hierarchy
* Components you'll need to create
* Responsive breakpoints
* Content management needs

*""Start with a Plan: Before you begin designing, outline the structure of your project. This includes understanding the scope, defining the components you'll need, and determining the layouts for various screens.""*

# 2. Use a Grid System

Implement a consistent grid system in your Figma file. This provides a structural framework that helps maintain alignment and spacing in Webflow.

# 3. Create a Design System

Build a comprehensive design system in Figma with:

* Color styles
* Text styles
* Effect styles
* Component libraries

This system will transfer more cleanly to Webflow and ensure consistency across your site.

# 4. Organize Your Layers and Frames

Keep your Figma file well-organized with:

* Logical naming conventions for layers and frames
* Proper grouping of related elements
* Clear hierarchy in your layer panel

 *""And please name each container accordingly, you'll thank me later.""*

# 5. Master Auto Layout

Auto layout is essential for successful Figma to Webflow transfers. Make sure you:

* Use auto layout for all components and sections
* Understand how padding, spacing, and alignment work in auto layout
* Apply constraints appropriately for responsive behavior

# 6. Add Design Annotations

Include notes and specifications directly in your Figma file to provide context on:

* Interaction behaviors
* Responsive changes
* Dynamic content areas
* Special functionality

# Step-by-Step: Using the Figma to Webflow Plugin

Now let's walk through the actual process of using the plugin to move your designs to Webflow.

# 1. Install and Connect

First, you need to get everything set up:

1. Install the Figma to Webflow plugin from the Figma Community
2. Open the plugin in Figma
3. Authorize your Webflow workspaces or sites through the plugin

# 2. Prepare Your Design for Export

With the plugin installed:

1. Select the frame or component you want to export
2. Make sure it uses auto layout
3. Check that all layers are properly named
4. Verify your styles are properly applied

# 3. Export Your Design

Now for the actual export:

1. With your design selected, open the Figma to Webflow plugin
2. Choose the Webflow site you want to export to
3. Click ""Copy to Webflow"" in the plugin window
4. Confirm the copy if prompted

# 4. Import in Webflow

Move over to Webflow to complete the process:

1. Open your Webflow project
2. Navigate to where you want to place the imported design
3. Paste the copied elements (Ctrl/Cmd+V)
4. Wait for the elements to appear in your Webflow canvas

# 5. Fine-tune in Webflow

Your design is now in Webflow, but you'll likely need to:

1. Adjust responsive settings
2. Clean up class names
3. Set up interactions and animations
4. Connect to your CMS if needed
5. Add any additional functionality

# Pro Tips for a Better Figma to Webflow Workflow

After working with both tools extensively, I've picked up some tips that can save you time and headaches:

# Start With Webflow's Built-in Components

The plugin offers premade structural elements that are already set up with the right auto layout properties and layer names. Using these as starting points can save you tons of time.

# Don't Try to Transfer Everything at Once

Instead of exporting your entire design, work page by page or even section by section. This makes troubleshooting much easier.

# Use Components Consistently

If you have similar elements across your design (like cards or buttons), make them components in Figma and keep the naming consistent. This helps the plugin create more efficient class structures in Webflow.

# Design at Multiple Breakpoints

Create designs for desktop, tablet, and mobile in Figma before exporting. This gives you a clear reference for how responsive behavior should work in Webflow.

# Consider a Hybrid Approach

Some designers find it most efficient to export the basic structure and components from Figma, then build more complex interactions directly in Webflow.

# Real User Experiences

The experiences with the Figma to Webflow plugin are mixed but generally positive:

One user rated it 4.8/5 stars and commented: *""Amazing, helpful.""*

Another user with more experience shared: *""This plugin saved my career in the early days! It was a bit tricky at first cause of the fixes I still had to do after pasting, but once I got the hang of it, it's been smooth sailing ever since.""*

A more advanced Webflow developer pointed out some limitations: *""It lacks three key features that are important to me as an advanced Webflow developer: Only one class ‚Äî it's impossible to have combo classes with this plugin, hence it's not effective at all; Class duplication ‚Äî breaks the point of the plugin completely since it creates a ton of classes; Only auto-layouts ‚Äî which I really like because they are awesome, but we do not use flexbox all the time.""*

One particularly honest review summed up the learning curve: *""Clicking on already existing groups of layers and expecting Figma to automagically sort your layer mess mambo-jambo is just wishful thinking. Do you want need autolayout everywhere? Well then, what you want to do is start that thing from scratch.""*

# Should You Design in Figma First or Go Straight to Webflow?

This is a common question, and the answer depends on your specific needs and workflow.

# When to Start in Figma:

* You're designing complex interfaces that need iteration
* You're working with a team of designers
* Client approval is needed before development begins
* You want to create and test prototypes before building
* You need to establish a design system

# When to Go Straight to Webflow:

* You're building a simple website with standard layouts
* You're experienced in Webflow and can design directly in it
* You need to move quickly from concept to published site
* You're working alone on both design and development

*""There are those who say you don't need to design in Figma before developing in Webflow. This is not how we roll. Even simple sites, it's important to carefully consider layout, sizing, interactions and more. It's hard to do that while developing the site within Webflow.""*

# Comparing Figma-to-Webflow with Alternatives

The Figma-to-Webflow workflow isn't the only option for designers and developers. Let's see how it compares to some alternatives:

# Figma to Framer

Framer has positioned itself as a Webflow competitor that's especially designer-friendly.

**Advantages of Framer:**

* More intuitive interface for designers familiar with Figma
* Excellent for creating interactive prototypes
* Fast performance and good scalability
* Better for simpler sites and landing pages

**Advantages of Webflow:**

* More powerful CMS capabilities
* Better e-commerce functionality
* More customization options
* Code export capability

# Figma to Custom Code

Some teams prefer to design in Figma and then hand off to developers for custom coding.

**Advantages of Custom Code:**

* Maximum flexibility and control
* No platform limitations
* Often better performance
* Can implement any design or functionality

**Advantages of Webflow:**

* Much faster development time
* No need for deployment or hosting setup
* Easier for designers to make updates
* Built-in CMS and hosting

# Building a Complete Website: From Figma to Webflow

If you're creating a full website from scratch using the Figma to Webflow workflow, here's a recommended process:

# 1. Start With the Style Guide

Begin by creating and exporting your design system elements:

* Typography styles
* Color palette
* Button styles
* Form elements
* Icons and common UI elements

# 2. Build the Homepage

The homepage usually contains most of the components you'll reuse throughout the site, making it a good starting point.

# 3. Make Things Responsive

After importing your homepage design, focus on making it responsive before moving on to other pages.

# 4. Create Reusable Components

Identify repeating elements and convert them to Webflow components for consistency and easier updates.

# 5. Build Secondary Pages

With your components and styles established, creating additional pages becomes much faster.

# 6. Implement CMS Collections

Set up your dynamic content structures if your site requires a CMS.

# 7. Add Forms and Interactions

Enhance your site with forms, animations, and interactive elements.

# 8. Optimize for SEO

Implement proper meta tags, alt text, and other SEO elements.

# 9. Test Thoroughly

Check your site on various devices and browsers before launch.

# 10. Publish and Monitor

Launch your site and continue to refine based on analytics and feedback.

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

When working with the Figma to Webflow workflow, watch out for these pitfalls:

# 1. Ignoring the User Journey

Don't focus solely on how individual screens look without considering how they connect. *""One of the most common mistakes is focusing solely on individual screens without considering how they connect and flow from one to another. Ignoring the user's journey can lead to a disjointed and confusing experience.""*

# 2. Overcomplicating Your Designs

Keep your wireframes and initial designs relatively simple. Adding too much detail early on can make the transition to Webflow more difficult.

# 3. Using Inconsistent UI Elements

Maintain consistency in your design language. Using different styles for similar elements creates confusion and extra work during development.

# 4. Neglecting Responsive Design

Design with multiple screen sizes in mind from the beginning, not as an afterthought.

# 5. Poor Documentation

Include clear annotations and explanations for interactions and special functionality.

# 6. Expecting Perfect Transfers

The plugin is powerful, but no automated tool is perfect. Expect to make some adjustments in Webflow after importing.

# The Future of Figma and Webflow Integration

The relationship between Figma and Webflow continues to evolve. Recent updates have added support for:

* Variable syncing between platforms
* Better component handling
* Improved style transfer

*""The introduction of variables and other Figma like aspects in to the Webflow designer suggests that there will be more and more functionality overlap between design and development.""*

We're likely to see even tighter integration in the future, potentially reaching a point where the line between design and development tools becomes increasingly blurred.

# Final Thoughts: Is Figma to Webflow Right for You?

The Figma to Webflow workflow isn't perfect for every project or team, but it offers significant advantages for many web design workflows.

**Consider this approach if:**

* You value design iteration and visual polish
* You work with teams that include both designers and developers
* You need to present and get approval on designs before building
* You want to maintain a consistent design system
* You're looking to speed up your development process

**Maybe look elsewhere if:**

* You're building extremely complex web applications
* You need highly customized functionality that Webflow can't support
* You're already very efficient working directly in Webflow
* Your projects require specialized development frameworks

Remember that tools should serve your workflow, not dictate it. Experiment with different approaches to find what works best for your specific needs.

*""The Figma to Webflow plugin is excellent for very basic sites. Just use the standard sections provided in the plugin and use them as starting point. For more individual layouts it's better to build them manually in webflow itself.""*

Whether you choose to embrace the Figma to Webflow workflow or forge your own path, the most important thing is finding a process that lets you create beautiful, functional websites efficiently and enjoyably.

We all want to give our chickens the best, and kitchen scraps can be a great way to add variety to their diet. However, it's essential to understand what's safe, what's not, and how to maintain a balanced diet.

First and foremost, remember that chickens are omnivores, but their primary nutrition should always come from a high-quality commercial feed, ideally a layer feed for laying hens. Kitchen scraps should be considered supplemental treats, making up no more than about 10% of their daily intake.

Now, let's talk about the foods you should absolutely avoid. Meat, especially uncooked, moldy, or processed, is a big no-no. Processed meats are loaded with unhealthy fats and salt, and raw meat can lead to food poisoning. Fast food items like pizza, fries, and burgers are also off the table due to their high fat and carbohydrate content. Avocados are toxic to chickens due to the presence of persin, and onions can cause anemia. Raw beans contain a poisonous substance, and raw eggs can encourage egg-eating. Excess citrus might cause feather picking and interfere with calcium absorption. Chocolate, candy, and sugar are toxic, and avoid apricot pits, apple seeds, popcorn, and donuts. In the UK, feeding kitchen scraps is actually against the law.

On the flip side, there are plenty of scraps you can give in moderation. Cooked meat in small amounts is okay, as are cooked potato skins without any green parts. Seeds, veggie peelings, banana peels, brown rice, and cooked pasta are all good options. Consider making a chicken mash with cooked leftovers, but keep portions small. Pumpkins in the coop can help with winter boredom, and scrambled eggs are a great source of protein for molting or unwell chickens.

When it comes to fruits, apples and pears are great, but remove the seeds. Peaches, apricots, and cherries are fine, but remove the pits. Berries like strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries are excellent choices. Melons are also a favorite, especially during hot summer days, as they provide hydration. Tomatoes, grapes (cut into quarters), and raisins are also good options.

For vegetables, avoid rhubarb and its leaves. Leafy greens like collard greens, lettuce, kale, and spinach are excellent. Bell peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, celery, corn on the cob, cucumbers, yams, squash, and cooked green beans are all safe and nutritious. Remember, never give them raw beans, raw potatoes, potato skins, or wild mushrooms unless you're an expert.

Carbohydrates like cooked pasta and bread are okay in moderation, but avoid moldy bread. Shelled and unsalted nuts are also good treats. Cooked meat like turkey, chicken, shrimp, and fish are all safe. Ham is fine in moderation due to its salt content. For treats, black soldier fly larvae are a favorite and more nutritious than mealworms. Yogurt provides probiotics, and many other chicken treats are available online.

Remember to avoid moldy bread, chocolate, candy, coffee grounds, and pickles. Be cautious with citrus, and never give them dry or uncooked beans. Avoid processed foods, high-fat, and high-salt items. Only give them as many scraps as they can eat in a day to prevent attracting pests.

The key takeaway is that just because you can eat it, doesn't mean your chickens should. Always prioritize a balanced diet from their regular feed. What table scraps do your chickens enjoy? Let's hear your experiences in the comments!

now i‚Äôm 8 months post partum it‚Äôs probably been back 5 or 6 times. i tried treating with coconut oil (lol i‚Äôm crunchy ok. don‚Äôt do that. instant relief but makes it worse) as well as using clotrimazole cream & pessaries. only thing that would clear it up is fluconazole tabs, which i can take now i‚Äôm not pregnant, but it always comes back eventually (or i‚Äôve had some success with fasting)

finally had enough and realised this has to be a wider lifestyle problem. if fasting helps, sugar must definitely be playing a role. i‚Äôm on day 3 of taking probiotics (higher dose to control yeast) as well as really minimising sugar and OMAD (only drinking water, black coffee, the occasional pepsi max)

the NEXT MORNING after starting the probiotics, i was applying my clotrimazole cream and realised that as soon as i entered the üêà, it was like i was prelubricated. just super duper slippy slidey. i don‚Äôt remember feeling like this in a LOOOOONG time, if ever. i guess this is a good thing (i often suffer soreness after sex) also, hasn‚Äôt massively increased my amount of discharge either as it doesn‚Äôt seem to be leaking OUT. just staying inside. but it feels mega mega wet

it has to be the probiotics? just to add i am a vegetarian who hates dairy yoghurt so i am assuming the amount of good bacteria i was getting previously was very low. i feel a lot better in my body after a few days of sugar detox too. still getting bouts of brain fog and headaches but i‚Äôm hydrating myself better, and my energy level is more consistent throughout the day- i don‚Äôt feel like i need a nap at 6pm lol",1,1742370775.0,Candida,0,1.0,False

Since your¬†[guests](https://tchelete.com/how-to-welcome-your-airbnb-guests/)‚Äô experiences will directly impact your ratings and occupancy rate, investing in quality furnishings should be seen as a strategy, not just a necessity.

According to¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)¬†data, listings with well-curated interiors and thoughtful amenities see up to 20% higher occupancy rates than those without that attention to detail.

# How Do I Furnish My Airbnb Like a Pro?

# 1.¬†Identify Your Target Audience

Who are you hoping to attract to your¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)? Families,¬†[business](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/)¬†travelers, couples, or solo adventurers? Tailor your furniture and decor choices to appeal to your primary¬†[guests](https://tchelete.com/how-to-welcome-your-airbnb-guests/):

* **Business Travelers**¬†may appreciate a dedicated workspace and ergonomic furniture.
* **Families**¬†likely need extra storage, kid-friendly spaces, and durable, easy-to-clean furniture.
* **Couples**¬†might love cozy nooks and ambiance lighting for a romantic setting.

This doesn‚Äôt mean your design can‚Äôt be versatile, but having a guest profile in mind helps you prioritize certain amenities over others.

# 2.¬†Choose Durable, Multi-Functional Furniture

Invest in pieces that are both stylish and practical:

* **Sofas with Sleeper Options**: Ideal for maximizing sleeping capacity in smaller spaces.
* **Stain-Resistant Fabrics**: These are a lifesaver for high-traffic furniture.
* **Storage Solutions**: Ottomans with storage, wall hooks, and multi-functional cabinets can reduce clutter and make the space feel more organized.

Quality furniture doesn‚Äôt always mean luxury items; sometimes mid-range options with high durability serve the purpose better, especially in spaces with high guest turnover.

# 3.¬†Opt for a Neutral Base, then Add Pops of Color

A neutral color palette creates a clean, relaxing look and works well across most styles and tastes. Add interest with accent pillows, artwork, and decor items in contrasting or vibrant colors.

This way, you‚Äôre free to update the look periodically without a complete overhaul, just by changing a few accessories.

# 4.¬†Focus on Comfort in Bedrooms and Living Areas

Prioritizing comfort will pay off in reviews. Go for:

* **High-Quality Mattresses**: A good night‚Äôs sleep can make or break a stay. If your budget allows, invest in memory foam or hybrid mattresses, which often rate highest in guest satisfaction.
* **Soft, Durable Linens**: Choose hypoallergenic and breathable materials. High-thread-count cotton or bamboo sheets feel luxurious without a massive price tag.
* **Ample Lighting**: Layer lighting with a combination of overhead, task, and accent lights for flexibility.

# 5.¬†Create a Functional Kitchen and Bathroom

Even if your¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)¬†isn‚Äôt large, practical kitchen and bathroom setups will make¬†[guests](https://tchelete.com/how-to-welcome-your-airbnb-guests/)¬†feel at home:

* **Stock the Essentials**: A full kitchen setup can include quality utensils, pots, and basic appliances like a coffee maker and toaster.
* **Think Practicality**: Avoid cluttering the space with too many items; instead, focus on items that will get used regularly, like dish racks, bath mats, and enough towels.
* **Easy-to-Clean Surfaces**: Choose materials like quartz or laminate for countertops; they‚Äôre durable and less prone to stains than other materials.

# 6.¬†Add Thoughtful Touches and Personalization

Adding character makes your¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)¬†memorable:

* **Local Artwork**: Supporting local artists can give your property a unique charm.
* **Books and Games**: These are small touches that encourage relaxation and make guests feel at home.

I live in the UK and recently I've been finding a lot of these critters in my kitchen. 

I don't mind them, I'm happy to cohabit, but today I found one almost in my coffee and it's brought me here to ask - what and why?!

Why are they in my kitchen? How are they getting in? 

It's pretty temperate where I am, its maybe 5 degrees right now and will be about 13 later. 

I'm in a 3rd floor flat and i dont have any windows open, as it has been cold for months. 

As I say, don't really mind them hanging out but I do draw the line at them getting into food and drinks.

Ideas? Thank you!",1,1742370625.0,insects,0,1.0,False

So basically you can say I grew up with this woman and her mother. They have been good to me and her mother has literally been a ""grandmother"" to me. The year I went away they caught her and her mother begged for a second chance so they reinstated her. Friday she was caught again and fired, her last working day would be the end of the month. She and her mother was crying in the office since Monday and my other coworker was crying yesterday. Today I saw the mother passing by my desk to go make herself some coffee and eat a sandwich and my heart broke. I'm fighting back the tears right now. I've known these people so long. She has two kids still in school. I know logically this is completely her own fault and she has to learn her lesson, she is lucky no criminal charges are being pressed or at least that I know off, but it just breaks my heart.

DAY 223 UPDATE.","**After 223 days from the time this started, I can tell you that it is done! I am 100% cured and back to normal. I have aged a lot in this time though. A little fatter, slower, wiser. I just moved back home to  Spokane for now. No constant farting, bloating, burping, pain, or FEAR, during 2025. I am cured.**

**Please read my story. I wish you luck! Godspeed.**

¬†Disclaimer, I lost my mind... you know.

Stress was a symptom and an antagonist, but not the cause.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\*\*\*--Day 1 of constant symptoms started on 8/8/24 (mild symptoms started over a week prior). Updates will follow until 100% cured.\*\*\*

¬†

I've been extremely sick for 17 days. I went to the ER 3 days ago for mental gastritis. Ekg, x-ray, CT, and blood work, were all clean. ER Suggested ulcers.

¬†

¬†

I was denied a urea breath test by LabCorp yesterday. No Doc Referal. Yesterday was the worst because I delayed medicine for the urea test.

¬†

I believe this is a seriously misunderstood stomach bug. I was paralyzed.

¬†

What is working now, suddenly? For almost the entire day. PPI, lots of Pepto, constant probiotic inoculations, raw broccoli. Added electrolytes. I was very depleted.

¬†

1st day mostly symptom-free. Planning 14 days of this same treatment that I put together after too much reading on Reddit and PubMed. <failed - keep reading>

¬†

I found that there is a demographic element to this bacteria. It may be part of a healthy gut biome for some people but intolerable to others. Only 15% of the population carries this bacteria where I came from. Vs 75% where I am now. I had never heard of this before.

¬†

My symptoms are extensive. 17 days. All day. Sternum chest pain, Left upper abdominal pain, Burning esophagus, Heavy bloat, gas, burps, Headache, backache, White fuzzy tongue, Dehydration & Hungry, Slow metabolism, Mental fog, super dumb, Panic attacks, fear, depression, Heart racing, palpitations, anemic, Dizzy, headache, ear ringing, Hard to breathe from chest, Sudden exhaustion after eating, Couldn't eat most food types for fear of being incapacitated. No vomit, no diarrhea, no sour reflux. Originally suspected hiatial hernia. I have never experienced anything like this.

¬†

36, male, very healthy. No alcohol. No drugs. I took aspirin when the symptoms started.

¬†

I'm sharing my story because I read all of your stories while I thought I was dying. I might not have survived if I didn't find answers. My family thought I was crazy. Stress ulcers, they said.

¬†

Stomach Ulcers(cancer) can be a foodborne illness. Ulcers make you crazy and malnourished. Stress does not dig a holes in your stomach. Bacteria does.

¬†

...............

¬†

Day 21

¬†

Update: I'm getting worse fast. I just canceled my vacation plans. I went back to ER, and they did not understand. I'm going to find an online doctor to RX the antibiotics. I think I have stomach ulcers. 99% confidence.

¬†

...............

¬†

Day 22

¬†

I'm starting antibiotics now. sesamecare online was $90 for the doctor's visit. Walgreens RX was $50. ER was bunk. They gave me a shot of morphine and a bill.

¬†

Clarithromycin 500mg 28x, twice daily, two weeks

¬†

Amoxicillin 500mg 56x, 2x twice daily, two weeks

¬†

Pantoprazole 40mg 30x, at night

¬†

Dr. Chinedu Ngwudike in El Paso, TX, helped me on the sesamecare website.

¬†

...............

¬†

Day 28

¬†

It is working. I survived.¬† Thank you, God.

¬†

...and Thank you to,¬† DR. CN.

¬†

Previous Symptoms: Gas, Heartburn, Bloating, Anemia, Binge Eating, and most importantly, delirium.

¬†

Current symptoms: stomach ache.

¬†

It never hurt worse than running a mile. However, the delirium peaked with hallucinations on day 2 and 3 of antibiotics. I'm still taking them. Even though they induce hyper manic episodes.

¬†

I worked 1 hour today. It has been too long.¬† I am eager to get back to work.

¬†

Health is wealth.

¬†

...............

¬†

Day 36

¬†

Zero symptoms, ever. taking the final dose of antibiotics right now. Working fulltime again.

¬†

To be clear, I know it would not have literally killed me, but I would have been doomed to a life not worth living.

¬†

I probably acquired the bacteria infection from drinking the water in a small Mexican village while I was getting dental work done 6 months ago. I was so naive to think that I could just put the water in my mouth like that.

¬†

...............

¬†

Day 40

¬†

Harsh PPI or acid rebound. It's back to square 1 minus the bloating. I'm guessing I have healing ulcers. I have decided to take PPI for 14 more days with 14 days of sucralfate. The ride through hell is not over yet, it appears.

¬†

...............

¬†

Day 42

¬†

Thankfully, Pantoprazole works perfectly. Re-stabilized in 48 hours.

¬†

¬†

...............

¬†

Day 49

¬†

I am not symptom-free despite PPI. I feel anemic. No bloating. Stomach hurts. Further addressing diet. Particularly drinking soda and caffeine plus eating spicy beef.

¬†

I tend to get reckless on my symptom-free days. Diet & exercise.

¬†

Carafate, probiotics, PPI are my current medicines.

¬†

..............

¬†

Day 53

¬†

I've been 95% symptom-free for 3-4 days.

Only slightly light-headed, left side, stomach pain is mild but slightly worse post-treatment.

¬†

Paying close attention to diet, water, and rest.

I have been able to work multiple 8-hour shifts recently.

¬†

I have 4 days left of Pantoprazole 40mg and then I will switch to 7 days of 20mg of omeprazole.

¬†

¬†

.............

¬†

Day 56

¬†

Symptom-free. I feel 100%

Last day of Pantoprazole Rx, switching to Omeprazole for 7 days. Still taking it slow, focused on healing.

¬†

.............

¬†

Day 57

¬†

I feel fine. Just working. Minor left side stomach ache.

¬†

Zero anemia (low nutrients) symptoms.

¬†

Up to 400mg of caffeine per day.

¬†

Only healthy foods prepared at home for now.

¬†

40mg of omeprazole at wake up. 1000mg carafate at bed.

¬†

I consume probiotics of some kind every day.

¬†

¬†

¬†

...........

¬†

Day 59

¬†

20mg omeprazole and 2000mg carafte

¬†

I feel great. No issues today. Yesterday was a little rocky, but barely. I felt off. But I expected side effects when switching from Pantorozole 40mg to Omeprazole 20mg.

¬†

I remain focused on staying clean, staying home, and eating healthy. However, I do enjoy eating just about anything I can cook at home.

¬†

Brocolli, Jalapeno, Hotdogs, and Mac n' cheese for dinner. I don't really drink Coke anymore. I used to drink soda 24/7. I replaced my soda addiction with water. However, my caffeine addiction remains. It's all I've got... Rockstar, coffee, milk, electrolytes, and extra water, have all been great.

¬†

I continue to eat probiotics every day, honey, yogurts, and the occasional probiotic pill. Florastar or Culturelle

¬†

¬†

..........

¬†

Day 61

¬†

Today, I was surprised by sudden food allergy type symptoms. A histamine intolerance after eating avocado and again after eating pbj. As soon as I ate the avocado, this weird taste never left my mouth, I felt dehydrated, hot, itchy, and very panicked. I kept my cool and went to bed. Ate pbj, and it continued. I woke up feeling fine. No bloating, though. I took an H2 blocker, but I'm not sure if it helped much.

¬†

...........

¬†

Day 65

¬†

¬†

It's been a roller-coaster, to say the least. 2 months of hell. I'm glad to say I'm eating pizza and drinking Rockstar right now, though. No problem. Light exercise still hurts a little on my stomach, though. And very rarely, I will have a bad symptom day. But I was basically paralyzed when this all started.

¬†

6 weeks of PPI, off and on, stopped yesterday. Triple therapy was completed 4 weeks ago. I took 20mg famotidine lastnight and today. Just in case.

¬†

.............

¬†

Day 70 (10 Weeks)

¬†

47 from the start of antibiotics.

¬†

33 days post triple therapy.

¬†

5 days off all meds.

¬†

I need to make an update. I am feeling quite normal again and working more. So I will be a successful case that soon fades away.

¬†

Compared to the Hpylori symptoms (ulcers) the following symptoms are one-tenth of the problems I was previously facing. But this is what I have felt lately.

¬†

I might have unusual food intolerance creeping in. I have never been allergic to anything. I have not narrowed it down yet though. Avocado, Canteloupe, maybe others. Very rarely I will eat one thing that that throws me off for the rest of the day. My mouth and throat will be burning, tingly, and chest tight, and I develop a histamine reaction. Tiny red dots on my skin. Body running hot, ears ring, dehydrated, etc. This is familiar from pre-treatment too.

¬†

I am planning to go for my first bike ride, in 10 days. Exercise has been more and more painful due to stomach inflammation. And I've been in bed way more than normal, for a long time. My stomach burns after 1-mile walks. On the last days of antibiotics, I rode my bike hard and was lit up for it. I was dry-heaving for the rest of the day and my stomach was on fire.

¬†

The average ulcer healing time is 40-50 days. So I am right on track. I also found a research paper that stated the more dangerous H pylori strains (ulcer/cancer) are less resistant to antibiotics. That is good news in my opinion. Today I rest easy. It all makes sense now; the whole process, as hard as it was.

¬†

We are all just scientists... the doctors, you, and I. Trust your gut. it has a profound effect on the body and mind.

¬†

...........

\-----------------------------------------------

¬†

On a scale of 1-10, this is how my pain peaked during the last 2 months.

¬†

6 - Lower abdomen (bloating)

¬†

5 - Sternum (heartburn esophagus)

¬†

5 - Headache (anemic)

¬†

4 - Upper left abdomen (stomach ulcers)

¬†

¬†

# How Do I Create an Airbnb Listing Like a Pro?

From writing a stellar description and choosing the best photos to setting competitive prices and managing guest expectations, here‚Äôs everything you need to know to make your¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)¬†listing shine.

# Step 1: Know Your Audience.

Before you even open the¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)¬†app to create your listing, think about the kind of¬†[guests](https://tchelete.com/how-to-welcome-your-airbnb-guests/)¬†you‚Äôd like to host.

**Hey There!**¬†¬†¬†  
What if you could make $10,000 a month doing what you love? Our proven strategy shows you how. Stop dreaming and start doing  
¬†**Get Started**¬†‚Äî¬†[bit.ly/4c0YO83](https://bit.ly/4c0YO83)

Are you hoping to attract¬†[business](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/)¬†travellers looking for a quiet workspace?

Or maybe you‚Äôre targeting families on vacation who need more space and kid-friendly amenities? Understanding your audience will help you highlight what matters most to them.

# Tips for Identifying Your Audience:

* **Research similar listings**¬†in your area to see who they‚Äôre attracting and what guests mention in reviews.
* Consider¬†**local attractions**¬†and tailor your listing to visitors who are likely coming for those activities.
* Think about the¬†**unique features of your space**¬†(location, amenities, style) and what type of guests they‚Äôd appeal to.

# Step 2: Set the Stage with Quality Photos.

Your listing photos are the first thing¬†[guests](https://tchelete.com/how-to-welcome-your-airbnb-guests/)¬†see, so make them count.¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)¬†stats show that listings with high-quality photos can earn up to 40% more than those with low-quality images.

If you can, consider hiring a professional photographer. It may seem like an¬†[investment](https://tchelete.com/how-to-identify-and-avoid-investment-scams/), but high-quality images pay for themselves over time.

# Key Tips for Taking Airbnb Photos:

* **Natural Light:**¬†Photograph your space during the day with plenty of natural light. Dark or poorly lit images can turn guests off.
* **Highlight Unique Features:**¬†If you have a cozy reading nook, a scenic balcony view, or a stylish bathroom, make sure these are front and center.
* **Capture Every Room:**¬†Guests want to see the whole space before booking, so include photos of each room and the exterior if possible.
* **Add Lifestyle Touches:**¬†Think of small, thoughtful touches like a cup of coffee by a window or a welcoming book on a table. It helps guests imagine themselves in your space.

# Step 3: Write an Irresistible Description.

The description is where you can sell the experience. Be honest but also a bit creative in painting a picture of what staying in your place will be like.

[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)¬†suggests keeping descriptions under 500 words and avoiding too much detail about things¬†[guests](https://tchelete.com/how-to-welcome-your-airbnb-guests/)¬†can see in the photos.

**Hey There!**¬†¬†¬†  
What if you could make $10,000 a month doing what you love? Our proven strategy shows you how. Stop dreaming and start doing  
¬†**Get Started**¬†‚Äî¬†[bit.ly/4c0YO83](https://bit.ly/4c0YO83)

# Writing Tips:

* **Lead with the Best Feature:**¬†Start with what makes your space unique. For example, ‚ÄúWake up to ocean views from every window‚Äù or ‚ÄúStay in a 1920s art-deco loft with rooftop access.‚Äù
* **Keep It Guest-Focused:**¬†Use language that focuses on what guests will experience. Instead of ‚ÄúWe offer a fully stocked kitchen,‚Äù say, ‚ÄúCook your favorite meals in a fully stocked kitchen.‚Äù
* **Mention Nearby Attractions:**¬†If your place is close to popular landmarks, include that information to attract tourists.

# Step 4: Price Your Listing Competitively.

Pricing can make or break your booking potential. Setting a competitive rate that reflects the value you‚Äôre offering (and that keeps up with similar listings in your area) is key to standing out without underselling yourself.

# Pricing Tips:

* **Research Comparable Listings:**¬†Look at listings similar to yours within a 5-10 mile radius. This helps you understand your local market better.
* **Adjust for High-Demand Dates:**¬†During events, holidays, or peak seasons, slightly increase your rates to maximize earnings.
* **Consider Length of Stay Discounts:**¬†Offering weekly or monthly discounts can attract longer-term guests, especially during the off-season.

# Step 5: Keep Your Profile and Rules Clear.

Guests appreciate a transparent and straightforward experience, so make sure your house rules, check-in instructions, and amenities are clearly stated. This can prevent misunderstandings and improve guest satisfaction.

# Essentials for a Clear Profile:

* **House Rules:**¬†Be upfront about any rules like quiet hours, no-smoking policies, or pet restrictions.
* **Check-In Instructions:**¬†Make the check-in process as simple as possible by providing clear instructions. Consider self-check-in options for added convenience.
* **Amenities:**¬†List everything you offer‚ÄîWi-Fi, parking, laundry facilities, and any unique extras like a hot tub or pool access.

# Pros and Cons of Becoming an Airbnb Host

If you‚Äôre still on the fence about creating a listing, here‚Äôs a quick look at the advantages and potential downsides.

# Pros:

* **Extra Income**: Earn a steady income stream by renting out space you‚Äôre not using.
* **Flexibility**: Control when you want to rent out your space and block off dates when it‚Äôs not available.
* **Meet New People**: Hosting can be a great way to meet people from around the world and learn about new cultures.

# Cons:

* **Time Investment**: Managing a listing, handling bookings, and responding to guests can take time, especially if you have a high turnover rate.
* **Upkeep Costs**: Regular maintenance and occasional repairs may be necessary, especially with frequent guests.
* **Potential Complaints**: Dealing with issues like noise, cleanliness, or unsatisfied guests can be challenging.

# FAQ

You manage bookings,¬†[cleaning](https://tchelete.com/how-to-get-more-airbnb-cleaning-jobs/), maintenance, and guest interactions‚Äîor you might choose to hire a¬†[property](https://tchelete.com/how-to-get-your-first-airbnb-property/)¬†manager if you‚Äôd rather keep things hands-off.

# Why Invest in Airbnb?

Short-term rentals have become a popular alternative to traditional real estate¬†[investment](https://tchelete.com/how-to-identify-and-avoid-investment-scams/)¬†because they often offer higher returns. In tourist-heavy areas, an¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)¬†can make more in one week than a traditional rental might in a month.

For instance, some¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)¬†owners report earning between $15,000 to $30,000 annually from a single¬†[property](https://tchelete.com/how-to-get-your-first-airbnb-property/), depending on the location and seasonality of the¬†[property](https://tchelete.com/how-to-get-your-first-airbnb-property/).

# How Do I Own an Airbnb Property?

# 1. Decide on Your Investment Budget.

Before jumping in, determine how much you‚Äôre willing to invest. Your budget will dictate a lot, from the location of the¬†[property](https://tchelete.com/how-to-get-your-first-airbnb-property/)¬†to its size and amenities. Keep in mind:

* **Down Payment**: Typically around 15-25% for investment properties.
* **Furnishing and Renovation**: Even simple updates can add up.
* **Operating Costs**: Cleaning, maintenance, utilities, and listing fees.

Budget realistically, allowing some cushion for unexpected expenses and fluctuations in bookings.

# 2. Research Location Carefully.

A¬†[property](https://tchelete.com/how-to-get-your-first-airbnb-property/)‚Äôs location can make or break its success as an¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/). Ideal¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)¬†locations are generally tourist-friendly, have a strong local economy, and have a shortage of hotels or traditional lodging.

Check sites like¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)‚Äôs market data tool, AirDNA, for insights into demand, occupancy rates, and average nightly prices in potential areas.

Top factors to consider:

* **Tourist Attractions**: Properties near beaches, landmarks, and national parks tend to have high demand.
* **Local Regulations**: Some cities, like New York and San Francisco, have strict regulations on short-term rentals.
* **Seasonality**: Ski resorts and beach towns may only bring in revenue during specific seasons.

# 3. Consider Financing Options.

After setting a budget and narrowing down a location, explore financing options. Investment loans for¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)¬†[properties](https://tchelete.com/how-to-manage-airbnb-properties/)¬†may require a higher down payment and can have higher interest rates. Some common choices are:

¬†**Get Started**¬†‚Äî¬†[bit.ly/4c0YO83](https://bit.ly/4c0YO83)

* **Conventional Loans**: Best for long-term investment plans.
* **Vacation Property Loans**: Specialized loans that may have unique requirements for Airbnb.
* **Cash Purchase**: Ideal if you can afford it, as it removes monthly payments and interest.

# 4. Legal and Tax Considerations.

Short-term rentals are regulated differently depending on the city or state. Investigate local laws and restrictions for¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/), as some locations may ban or limit short-term rentals altogether.

From a tax perspective,¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)¬†income is generally taxable, and you‚Äôll likely need to pay self-employment taxes. However, many¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)¬†owners can deduct expenses such as¬†[property](https://tchelete.com/how-to-get-your-first-airbnb-property/)¬†management fees,¬†[cleaning](https://tchelete.com/how-to-get-more-airbnb-cleaning-jobs/)¬†costs, utilities, and mortgage interest.

# 5. Create a Unique and Comfortable Space.

Guests have high expectations for¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/), and creating a comfortable, unique environment can lead to positive reviews and repeat bookings. Here are some tips for optimizing your space:

* **Quality Furnishings**: Invest in comfortable furniture, quality bedding, and amenities like coffee makers or smart TVs.
* **Themed D√©cor**: A unique style can make your listing memorable and attract more guests.
* **Professional Photos**: High-quality photos make a huge difference in how your listing appears online.

# 6. List and Market Your Property.

Once your¬†[property](https://tchelete.com/how-to-get-your-first-airbnb-property/)¬†is ready, it‚Äôs time to list it. When creating an¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)¬†listing, focus on what makes your¬†[property](https://tchelete.com/how-to-get-your-first-airbnb-property/)¬†unique and appealing:

* **Detailed Descriptions**: Highlight key amenities and nearby attractions.
* **Pricing Strategy**: Be competitive but not undervalued. Consider seasonal pricing adjustments.
* **Prompt Responses**: Airbnb rewards responsiveness, and quick replies help build guest confidence.

# Pros and Cons of Owning an Airbnb Property

# Pros

* **Potentially Higher Income**: In high-demand areas, Airbnb can bring in more income than long-term rentals.
* **Flexibility**: Owners can block off dates to use the property themselves.
* **Tax Deductions**: Hosts can deduct expenses related to the property, including utilities, repairs, and even property management fees.

# Cons

* **Seasonal or Unpredictable Income**: Locations dependent on tourist seasons can see drastic variations in occupancy.

1jerq94,https://www.reddit.com/r/macbook/comments/1jerq94/mbp_screen_better_for_eyes/,MBP Screen Better for Eyes?,"Tl;DR - does the upgrade to a Pro model screen result in less eye strain if 95% of my work is text and presentation based?

I live in a sunny climate (especially now between March and September), work in coffee shops or in my room (which is right next to a window), and my eye sight has went from a perfect 20/20 to dogshite in the span of the last 2 years. It's gotten so bad that I need to take very frequent breaks away from my laptop because my vision keeps getting blurry.

I'm not as concerned about glare as I am about protecting my eyes, and actually being able to power through my work sessions every day.

For reference, I'm currently driving a 2019 intel MBP (13 inch), with the base 4-core i5, 8gb ram, 128 ssd, which still serves me, but due to the nature of my work (and my eyes), and it's very weak battery I'm looking for an upgrade.

My question is, for my day-to-day usecases, an M3 MBA with even just 16RAM is plenty, and even stacking it against a M4 Air I wouldn't notice a difference. I do consulting - i.e. design decks, presentations, write a lot, and work with productivity tools (Notion, Figma, Canva, Presentation software, etc.). So 95% of my work is text-based stuff. And a lot of times, very small text-based stuff.

Would paying a few hundred more for the Pro model have any impact on easing eye strain, and allowing for more comfortable work sessions? I don't care about the spec bump from the Air -> Pro or paying extra for power I will never use. Viewing experience and easing eye strain is all that I care about, and I will happily pay more if it meant being able to move through more work in one sitting.

>Hello r/relationships!

>I am using a throwaway because this is a personal question and I have never really come on this subreddit before, so excuse me if I do any formatting wrong. Sorry for how long this is, I am seriously heartbroken right now and so lost.

>So I (21 M) met this girl (let's call her Jaime and she is 19) in January of this year at the start of second semester at our university when we worked in one of the rec centers together. She was a freshman and I was a Junior. She started college a semester late (she said becuase of family issues) and said she was nervous about it, so I decided to show her around a bit. We got lunch a few times during her first month on campus and I gave her tours of the campus. We hit it off immediately! I know it is cliche, but I have never felt this way about any other girl before. Seriously. She is so beautiful, she is the smartest person I have ever met, she is hilarious, and we even like some of the same TV shows and have the same hobbies! After those first few weeks, we weren't able to hang out as much because she was so busy with work and school, but we worked together Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday nights. While we weren't busy, we would always talk about TV shows and movies we enjoyed. Outside of work, we texted a lot too! Well, a few weeks passed and we hadn't hung out outside of work and I realized how much I liked her, so at the end of one of our shifts, I asked Jaime out on a date. She told me she doesn't think about me that way, but promised we could stay friends. This really really hurt. I cried in my apartment and couldn't bring myself to go to class the next day. I honestly thought she liked me, and I had been so nice to her. I even picked her up her favorite drink from starbucks on my way to work most days even though she never asked me to and told me I didn't need to.

>So another month passes and I am trying to keep up the friendship we have and just appreciate her presence. I ask her to hang out a few times (I even told her it was just as friends) and she said she was so busy she couldn't (she could have been lying though). I tried keeping up text message conversations with her, but she would forget to reply a lot. I genuinely don't understand this. How does someone forget to reply to a text? Especially to a friend? And even if she was ignoring me, why? Why agree to be friends if she didn't want to be? But I still loved her so much and I held out hope.

>So spring break came around and it was our last shift together before the break. I wanted to do something special for her to show her how much she means to me as a friend. I got her some flowers and a bracelet (nothing too expensive, just like a $15 one from the store). I gave it to her at the end of our work shift (I had them hiding in my car and gave them to her in the parking lot). I had planned out exactly what I would say and I didn't even expect anything back. Just appreciation, you know? But I guess she didn't appreciate the thought I put into it because she told me she didn't want to accept the flowers or the bracelet. I got kind of upset and we got in an argument. But I ended up telling her it was ok that she didn't want to accept it and just asked her for a hug.

>She went home for break and I went home as well. I had my 21st birthday during it, and I got pretty wasted with some of my cousins that weekend. I am not proud of this, but I did drunk call her a few times. I left her some voicemails about how I loved her if she ever wanted to date a guy that would cherish her like a queen. She never replied, and I was pretty embarrassed. I sent her some texts essentially explaining that I was so sorry I said those things, but I stand by everything I said (I can copy paste them here if you wanna see them, but this is getting long already so i guess I will only do it if you all think you need to see it to give me advice).

>So we got back to school and I hadn't heard from her, so I planned on talking to her about it at work, but I found out she had changed her schedule and was working different shifts from me now. I never found out why and no one told me why. I tried facebook messaging her, snapchatting her, and even sending her an email asking if she was angry with me or if we could meet up to talk because I didn't want to lose a great friend. I saw that she saw my messages on FB messenger, but she never replied. This pissed me off a lot since I had been nothing except for sweet to her. I stopped messaging her for a few weeks in April, but then the school year started to come to a close and I realized I couldn't bear being without her or not being able to see her for the summer. I sent her a few more messages, but she never replied, so I decided I would go straight to her dorm room. I didn't know exactly where she was, only the building, but I went there one afternoon when I knew she had a final and wandered around the halls hoping to catch her on her way back. I didn't see her, but apparently, she saw me because she texted me asking what I was doing in her dorm. I explained (again) that I wanted to see her and talk, but she told me to leave her alone. So I left in tears, skipped my last final (got an incomplete in the class for it) and went home.

>I have spent the last month in absolute depression. I think about her every day. She blocked me on social media, so I can't see her profile, but I haven't texted her since school ended. But it finally got to be too much for me. I decided I would try one more time to show her how much I love her. I knew the town she moved to school from (it's only like an hour away from me and I have family that lives nearby- we have talked about it before), so I texted her and told her I was coming to meet her. I was going to meet her at X coffee shop and I wanted to talk about everything. Once again, she couldn't even do me the respect of replying. I checked her Instagram that night and saw that she was out partying that very night. There were pictures of her with alcohol (she is UNDERAGE) and her wearing skanky clothes (she told me she hated partying). its like she has become a totally different person. So I did freak out a little. I told her about how much I cared and about how awful it was for her to just ignore me like that. That I was going to come to coffee shop on X day and if she should do me the respect of coming to see me. She never replied, but I got a piece of mail today. It was a fucking cease and desist letter. She said she would ""seek legal avenues"" if I didn't stop ""harassing"" her. What the fuck reddit? Now I don't need legal advice because I am going to cross post this to r/legaladvice for that, but what do I do now that she thinks I am a total creep? How do i get her to hear me out? I refuse to just live knowing she hates me. There has to be some way I can do this. Please help me. I know I have made some mistakes, but I promise I am a nice guy and I just want her to be happy.

Lucy and I have been friends for a while and I do like her however this weekend when we met for coffee she gave me a bad quality second hand book. For further details, the book's cover was slightly torn, many pages folded, and very orange and smelled strongly of old. She then told me it was from a thrift shop and gave it to me. Idk i just felt a little ""oh isnt this a litttttle bit rude?"" like i would never give someone something used, but if i did I'd make sure it was in good condition you know? anyway, i forgot to take the book with me as my friend had put it back in her bag and taken it home by accident (we both forgot) and i texted her the next day ""oh sorry i forgot to take the book but thank you so much for it!!"" and she said ""its fine i wanted to read it a littlw more anyway"" like ?????????? is this a gift or a disposal?? idk what to think of it, maybe I'm being dramatic but like is that not rude?",0,1742369989.0,AmItheAsshole,10,0.2,False

From what she told me she used to be really obese in her childhood and growing up poor, so typical poor and very unhealthy diet combination with neglecting parents. This all caused her to give up on secondary education and instead went into trade school and she is now working in carpentry shop (which I think is quite cool given the circumstances). This allowed her to kind of spread her wings (stable income, living alone) I guess and finally live debt free and not under the poverty line. She lost almost 100lbs in past 5 years and I believe her seeing her older photos. She has this stout frame but now it's all firm shapes and all, quite beautiful. So she has that newly found life joy aura around her, but I've also noticed it's easy to poke through that and then she shuts down. I think there's trauma from neglecting parents and the old mindset of not being fit or pretty and despite her reality today being quite the opposite, she is just easy to shut down like she has no confidence or selfesteem. 

Obviously seeing all this I wanted to help her as we hung out and it was quite fun and all, I felt like she could be my older sister but just before christmas the vibe changed little bit and it's been getting worse since and so finally I had opportunity to sit with her and ask her. Apparently she found out from mutual friends that I'm from wealthy family and she felt like we have nothing in common. I have been also nagging her about buying stuff in discounts all the time. She has that typical obession, instead of buying apples she really likes for full price she would buy those she doesn't like much just because they are 10% cheaper. I've naged maybe dozen times before I got the hint that she is not playing annoyance when I nag her but she is genuinely annoyed by me and I think it clicked for her in negative way when she found out my family's background.

I'm far from perfect I do sometime realise I live in a boubble not being able to connect with people from different social classes and I even hate the fact I see people spread into classes but especially my mom would be kinda strict about that so it's sort of ingrained in me.

So in my ultimate wisdom (big sarcasm) I have offered her to give her 6000 pounds for this year so she could try one year to live without buying stuff in discounts that she doesnt even want, so she could try to just overlook that part of her that is IMO neglecting herself in exchange for saving little bit of money she doesn't need to safe at the moment (given her healthy financials). I thought it's sort of like helping hand in therapy, remove restriction of someone for a while and let them look at the world witout that particular hinderence and it can make them heal.

Well, it didn't go well. We were at coffee shop, she get kinda shocked told me ""it's kind of sick joke of you, innit?"" and then excused herself for bathroom but she didn't come back, she left. That was exactly two weeks ago, I tried to reach her but I am being left on ""read"" without reply.

Do you think there's any way of fixing this friendship? I didn't want to just ""throw money"" at her for no reason I wanted to help her in a way that she can see she is in position to live her life in more free way without hindering yourself of habbits of past which are not necessary anymore.

TL;DR: New friend grew up poor, she found out I'm wealthy and vibe changed for worse. She is stable financially and I offered to give her money so she doesnt have to buy stuff she doesnt even want in discounts frantically like she's still very poor.

1jernq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1jernq8/the_martian_leap_spacex_humanity_and_the_cosmic/,"The Martian Leap: SpaceX, Humanity, And The Cosmic Mirror","
Consider the universe: a vast expanse where stars flicker with ancient light and galaxies turn in slow, silent spirals. It‚Äôs an endless interplay of forces, and here we are‚Äîhumanity, a restless speck on Earth, forever peering beyond the horizon. For millennia, we‚Äôve been at it in our little corner‚Äîshaping tools from rock, conjuring myths to explain the shadows, brewing coffee to dodge the quiet ache of existence. But something‚Äôs stirring now. Through SpaceX and the fierce, untamed vision of Elon Musk, we‚Äôre stepping into a new act: colonizing Mars. This isn‚Äôt just a jaunt across space‚Äîit‚Äôs a bold reimagining of what we‚Äôre capable of, a leap into the unknown with our eyes wide open.

This isn‚Äôt about abandoning Earth. Earth‚Äôs no discardable relic‚Äîit‚Äôs the cradle, the soil where we took our first shaky steps and learned to ask ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù From the spark of life in some muddy pool to the equations scrawled across blackboards, it‚Äôs been a long, winding climb. Mars isn‚Äôt a replacement or a trophy‚Äîit‚Äôs a challenge, a red-dust riddle asking, ‚ÄúWhat else you got?‚Äù SpaceX isn‚Äôt here to pack our bags and flee; they‚Äôre here to stretch the map, to see how far ‚Äúhome‚Äù can reach. Those rockets piercing the atmosphere, those steel beasts aimed at the void‚Äîthey‚Äôre us, raw and determined, reaching because it‚Äôs in our nature to push past the edge.

Mars doesn‚Äôt roll out a welcome mat. It‚Äôs a harsh, unyielding place‚Äînights that freeze solid, air too thin to breathe, ground more grit than growth. It‚Äôs been sitting there, stark and patient, a blank slate with a mean streak. Yet that‚Äôs the draw: its indifference dares us to show up anyway. Not to dominate‚Äînature‚Äôs no lackey‚Äîbut to collaborate, to carve out a foothold. SpaceX links the dreamers to the doers, and in that bridge, something might take root‚Äîa dome, a garden, a mark in the dirt. It‚Äôs not about claiming; it‚Äôs about creating, turning a void into a verse.

Make no mistake: this is tough as nails. Space doesn‚Äôt coddle‚Äîno air, no shortcuts, no forgiveness if the math‚Äôs off. We‚Äôre soft, squishy things, built for meadows and streams, not radiation-soaked plains. But that‚Äôs the thrill of it‚Äîthe absurdity, the nerve to look at the abyss and say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make it work.‚Äù SpaceX isn‚Äôt just banking on machines; they‚Äôre banking on that stubborn human streak, the one that turned mud huts into cities and oceans into roads. The universe doesn‚Äôt care either way‚Äîit‚Äôs just there, waiting to see if we‚Äôll rise to the occasion or blink.

Here‚Äôs the twist: Mars is more than a rock‚Äîit‚Äôs a reflection. Stare at it, and you‚Äôre staring at us, stripped bare. Without Earth‚Äôs comforts‚Äîthe breeze, the birds, the backup plan‚Äîwhat are we? Do we fold, or do we adapt? Mars could shake us loose from our petty squabbles, our lines in the sand, our ‚Äúus‚Äù versus ‚Äúthem.‚Äù It might whisper that home isn‚Äôt a patch of ground‚Äîit‚Äôs the ties we weave, the stars we chase, the whole tangled web of being. This isn‚Äôt just about settling a planet; it‚Äôs about unsettling ourselves, seeing what holds when the props are gone.

The farther we go‚Äîpast the moon, through the dark, onto that crimson crust‚Äîthe nearer we come to what‚Äôs already here. Every liftoff, every landing, every gritty triumph loops back to the heart of us. We‚Äôre not apart from the cosmos; we‚Äôre the cosmos, waking up with a smirk and a wrench in hand. SpaceX, with its sweat and swagger, is just the latest thread in this old tapestry‚Äînot about grabbing the stars, but about realizing they‚Äôre already ours to dance with.

Time shifts out there, too. Earth‚Äôs all hustle‚Äîclocks, calendars, yesterday‚Äôs regrets piling up. Mars doesn‚Äôt play that game. Its days drag a little longer, its scars tell tales older than our oldest stories. Standing on it might jolt us out of our rush, remind us we‚Äôre not just racing through hours‚Äîwe‚Äôre woven into something vast and unhurried. SpaceX‚Äôs missions don‚Äôt just span distance; they puncture our bubble of ‚Äúnow,‚Äù letting the timeless seep in. What‚Äôs a lifetime of effort against a world that‚Äôs waited eons for us to knock?

So Mars isn‚Äôt the finish line‚Äîit‚Äôs the pivot. It‚Äôs where we swap ‚Äúget by here‚Äù for ‚Äúthrive anywhere.‚Äù We‚Äôre not adding square footage; we‚Äôre rewriting ‚Äúwe.‚Äù SpaceX lights the fuse‚Äîthe tech, the tenacity, the sheer chutzpah to try. It‚Äôs a call to quit being Earth‚Äôs guests and become the universe‚Äôs kin, to let the things that divide us fade like echoes. In its rugged plains, we might glimpse ourselves anew; in its quiet, hear a summons to what we could be. The universe isn‚Äôt elsewhere‚Äîit‚Äôs here, in the gamble, the grit, the choice to build where nothing was. That‚Äôs the spark, and SpaceX is just the flint striking it.",0,1742369908.0,space,0,0.36,False

**CO BURRICK:**  
Move it, Biden. Welcome to paradise. Unit B, bunk with Schillinger.  

*Hunter freezes as VERNON SCHILLINGER, 50s, bald, sinewy, and radiating menace, steps out of a cell. His Aryan tattoos gleam under the lights. He sizes Hunter up with a predator‚Äôs grin.*

**SCHILLINGER:**  
Well, well. The prodigal son. Daddy‚Äôs little fuck-up, huh? Heard you like to party.

*Hunter hesitates. Schillinger grabs him by the neck, slams him against the glass wall. Inmates hoot and bang on their cells.*

**SCHILLINGER:**  
I said *move*, bitch!  

*Schillinger drags Hunter into the cell, kicking the door shut. Inside, it‚Äôs stark‚Äîtwo bunks, a toilet, a sink. Schillinger looms over Hunter, who‚Äôs backed into a corner.*

**SCHILLINGER:**  
*(shouting)* Gentlemen! Meet my new prag‚ÄîHunter Biden! Used to run with the deep state, now he runs my errands. Say hi, Hunter!  

*Inmates jeer. Hunter stares at the floor. Schillinger rips Hunter‚Äôs shirt open, spins him to show the swastika peeking above his waistband.*

**SCHILLINGER:**  
Check it‚Äîbranded him like cattle. My little Biden cow. Moo for ‚Äòem, prag!  

**HUNTER:**  
*(mumbling)* Stop‚Ä¶  

**SCHILLINGER:**  
*(slaps his back)* Louder! Moo, or I‚Äôll have you barking like Obama‚Äôs dog at a drone strike!  

*Hunter, defeated, lets out a weak ‚Äúmoo.‚Äù The crowd erupts in laughter. Schillinger beams.*

**SCHILLINGER:**  
That‚Äôs it! See, boys, even a Biden can learn tricks. Next, I‚Äôll have him painting my nails‚Äîcall it ‚Äúart therapy‚Äù like his shitty canvases.  

*He shoves Hunter toward a table, grabs a deck of cards, scatters them on the floor.*

Pick ‚Äòem up, one by one. Count ‚Äòem out loud‚Äîlike you counted Daddy‚Äôs votes in ‚Äô20.  

*Hunter kneels, starts gathering cards, voice trembling.*

One‚Ä¶ two‚Ä¶  

**SCHILLINGER:**

* **Legal Considerations:**¬†Some cities have strict regulations for short-term rentals. Make sure to review local rules and HOA restrictions to avoid fines or legal issues.

# Step 2: Prepare Your Property.

Once you‚Äôve picked your property, it‚Äôs time to prepare it. A well-prepared, comfortable space not only attracts more guests but also boosts your reviews and future bookings.

# Key Preparations:

1. **Cleanliness:**¬†Hiring a professional cleaning service can help ensure the space is spotless for each guest.
2. **Stock Essentials:**¬†Provide basic toiletries, fresh towels, bed linens, and kitchen essentials like coffee, tea, and cooking supplies.
3. **Smart Decor:**¬†Simple, stylish, and comfortable interiors tend to attract guests. Adding a few unique touches‚Äîlocal art or a cozy reading nook‚Äîcan help your listing stand out.
4. **Safety Measures:**¬†Include smoke detectors, first aid kits, and clear emergency instructions.

# Step 3: Create an Eye-Catching Listing.

Your¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)¬†listing acts as the first impression, so make it count. High-quality photos and a well-written description can make all the difference.

# Tips for Creating a Great Listing:

* **Professional Photos:**¬†Listings with high-quality photos tend to book 24% more often, according to Airbnb. Consider hiring a photographer, or at least use a high-quality camera and natural lighting.
* **Detailed Descriptions:**¬†Describe each room, the amenities, and what makes your property unique. Avoid exaggeration and focus on the aspects that genuinely set your place apart.
* **Accurate Pricing:**¬†Use Airbnb‚Äôs pricing tool to get a sense of local rates and adjust accordingly. You might consider slightly lower rates to build up your reviews initially.

# Step 4: Manage Your Airbnb Business.

Once the bookings start, managing the¬†[business](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/)¬†smoothly is key. Consistent quality will keep your occupancy rates high and attract good reviews.

* **Stay on Top of Maintenance:**¬†Regularly check the property for wear and tear and fix issues quickly to prevent complaints.
* **Guest Reviews:**¬†Encourage guests to leave reviews. Respond professionally to both positive and negative feedback to build a strong reputation.

# Pros and Cons of Running an Airbnb Business

* **Guest Damage:**¬†There‚Äôs always the risk of guests causing damage. Airbnb offers Host Protection Insurance, but handling incidents can be stressful.

# Common Questions

# How much does it cost to start an Airbnb business?

Startup costs vary widely. If you‚Äôre renting out a property you already own, you might spend $1,000 to $3,000 setting up the essentials. For new properties, you‚Äôll need a down payment, furnishings, and possibly some remodeling, which can add up to tens of thousands.

# Do I need to own a property to start an Airbnb?

No. Many hosts use rental arbitrage, where they rent a property long-term, then sublet it on¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)¬†(with the landlord‚Äôs permission). Another option is co-hosting, where you manage someone else‚Äôs property in exchange for a fee.

# How can I protect my property from damage?

[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)‚Äôs Host Protection Insurance provides some coverage, but it‚Äôs smart to set a damage deposit and clarify house rules in your listing. Regularly checking in with guests and setting clear expectations can help reduce incidents.

# How much can I make on Airbnb?

Income varies based on location, property type, and occupancy rates. According to a 2022 report, the average U.S. host earned around $13,800 annually, but those in top tourist cities can earn much more.

# How do I handle negative reviews?

First, stay calm and professional. If the criticism is valid, own up to it and mention how you‚Äôll improve. If it‚Äôs unfair, respond factually but diplomatically. Avoid long explanations, and focus on showing future guests that you‚Äôre responsive and committed to a good experience.

1jerj3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarsSociety/comments/1jerj3g/the_martian_leap_spacex_humanity_and_the_cosmic/,"The Martian Leap. SpaceX, Humanity, And The Cosmic Mirror","
Consider the universe: a vast expanse where stars flicker with ancient light and galaxies turn in slow, silent spirals. It‚Äôs an endless interplay of forces, and here we are‚Äîhumanity, a restless speck on Earth, forever peering beyond the horizon. For millennia, we‚Äôve been at it in our little corner‚Äîshaping tools from rock, conjuring myths to explain the shadows, brewing coffee to dodge the quiet ache of existence. But something‚Äôs stirring now. Through SpaceX and the fierce, untamed vision of Elon Musk, we‚Äôre stepping into a new act: colonizing Mars. This isn‚Äôt just a jaunt across space‚Äîit‚Äôs a bold reimagining of what we‚Äôre capable of, a leap into the unknown with our eyes wide open.

This isn‚Äôt about abandoning Earth. Earth‚Äôs no discardable relic‚Äîit‚Äôs the cradle, the soil where we took our first shaky steps and learned to ask ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù From the spark of life in some muddy pool to the equations scrawled across blackboards, it‚Äôs been a long, winding climb. Mars isn‚Äôt a replacement or a trophy‚Äîit‚Äôs a challenge, a red-dust riddle asking, ‚ÄúWhat else you got?‚Äù SpaceX isn‚Äôt here to pack our bags and flee; they‚Äôre here to stretch the map, to see how far ‚Äúhome‚Äù can reach. Those rockets piercing the atmosphere, those steel beasts aimed at the void‚Äîthey‚Äôre us, raw and determined, reaching because it‚Äôs in our nature to push past the edge.

Mars doesn‚Äôt roll out a welcome mat. It‚Äôs a harsh, unyielding place‚Äînights that freeze solid, air too thin to breathe, ground more grit than growth. It‚Äôs been sitting there, stark and patient, a blank slate with a mean streak. Yet that‚Äôs the draw: its indifference dares us to show up anyway. Not to dominate‚Äînature‚Äôs no lackey‚Äîbut to collaborate, to carve out a foothold. SpaceX links the dreamers to the doers, and in that bridge, something might take root‚Äîa dome, a garden, a mark in the dirt. It‚Äôs not about claiming; it‚Äôs about creating, turning a void into a verse.

Make no mistake: this is tough as nails. Space doesn‚Äôt coddle‚Äîno air, no shortcuts, no forgiveness if the math‚Äôs off. We‚Äôre soft, squishy things, built for meadows and streams, not radiation-soaked plains. But that‚Äôs the thrill of it‚Äîthe absurdity, the nerve to look at the abyss and say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make it work.‚Äù SpaceX isn‚Äôt just banking on machines; they‚Äôre banking on that stubborn human streak, the one that turned mud huts into cities and oceans into roads. The universe doesn‚Äôt care either way‚Äîit‚Äôs just there, waiting to see if we‚Äôll rise to the occasion or blink.

Here‚Äôs the twist: Mars is more than a rock‚Äîit‚Äôs a reflection. Stare at it, and you‚Äôre staring at us, stripped bare. Without Earth‚Äôs comforts‚Äîthe breeze, the birds, the backup plan‚Äîwhat are we? Do we fold, or do we adapt? Mars could shake us loose from our petty squabbles, our lines in the sand, our ‚Äúus‚Äù versus ‚Äúthem.‚Äù It might whisper that home isn‚Äôt a patch of ground‚Äîit‚Äôs the ties we weave, the stars we chase, the whole tangled web of being. This isn‚Äôt just about settling a planet; it‚Äôs about unsettling ourselves, seeing what holds when the props are gone.

The farther we go‚Äîpast the moon, through the dark, onto that crimson crust‚Äîthe nearer we come to what‚Äôs already here. Every liftoff, every landing, every gritty triumph loops back to the heart of us. We‚Äôre not apart from the cosmos; we‚Äôre the cosmos, waking up with a smirk and a wrench in hand. SpaceX, with its sweat and swagger, is just the latest thread in this old tapestry‚Äînot about grabbing the stars, but about realizing they‚Äôre already ours to dance with.

Time shifts out there, too. Earth‚Äôs all hustle‚Äîclocks, calendars, yesterday‚Äôs regrets piling up. Mars doesn‚Äôt play that game. Its days drag a little longer, its scars tell tales older than our oldest stories. Standing on it might jolt us out of our rush, remind us we‚Äôre not just racing through hours‚Äîwe‚Äôre woven into something vast and unhurried. SpaceX‚Äôs missions don‚Äôt just span distance; they puncture our bubble of ‚Äúnow,‚Äù letting the timeless seep in. What‚Äôs a lifetime of effort against a world that‚Äôs waited eons for us to knock?

So Mars isn‚Äôt the finish line‚Äîit‚Äôs the pivot. It‚Äôs where we swap ‚Äúget by here‚Äù for ‚Äúthrive anywhere.‚Äù We‚Äôre not adding square footage; we‚Äôre rewriting ‚Äúwe.‚Äù SpaceX lights the fuse‚Äîthe tech, the tenacity, the sheer chutzpah to try. It‚Äôs a call to quit being Earth‚Äôs guests and become the universe‚Äôs kin, to let the things that divide us fade like echoes. In its rugged plains, we might glimpse ourselves anew; in its quiet, hear a summons to what we could be. The universe isn‚Äôt elsewhere‚Äîit‚Äôs here, in the gamble, the grit, the choice to build where nothing was. That‚Äôs the spark, and SpaceX is just the flint striking it.",0,1742369302.0,MarsSociety,0,0.5,False

But getting your place ready for¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)¬†guests isn‚Äôt as simple as just listing it.

To make sure guests have a comfortable stay and leave positive reviews (which will boost future bookings), it‚Äôs important to prepare your home thoughtfully.

In this guide, I‚Äôll walk you through the steps to get your home¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)\-ready, whether you‚Äôre renting out a cosy spare room, a small apartment, or an entire house.

# How Do I Prepare My House For Airbnb?

# 1. Cleaning and Decluttering: First Things First.

A clean home is essential for a good guest experience. When someone is paying to stay, they‚Äôll expect cleanliness to rival that of a hotel. Deep-cleaning the house should be your first step:

¬†**Get Started**¬†‚Äî¬†[bit.ly/4c0YO83](https://bit.ly/4c0YO83)

* **Floors**: Vacuum and mop all floors, paying special attention to entryways.
* **Bathrooms**: Scrub toilets, sinks, bathtubs, and mirrors until they shine. Consider adding extra toiletries like soap, shampoo, and conditioner, which guests appreciate.
* **Kitchen**: Clean appliances, countertops, cabinets, and ensure there are no food stains or crumbs around. Stock basics like salt, pepper, oil, and maybe a few snacks or bottled water.
* **Bedrooms**: Clean sheets and linens are a must. Even consider a neutral, soothing colour scheme to give the room a calm vibe.

Lastly, clear out the clutter. If you‚Äôre renting the entire space, lock away valuables or personal items in a private closet or cabinet.

# 2. Safety Preparations: Making Sure Guests Feel Secure.

People staying in your home want to feel safe. Here‚Äôs how to create that sense of security:

* **Install Smoke & Carbon Monoxide Detectors**: Most Airbnb hosts are required to have both. Test them regularly to ensure they‚Äôre functional.
* **First Aid Kit**: Place a small kit in the bathroom or kitchen, with essentials like band-aids, pain relievers, and antiseptic wipes.
* **Emergency Contact Information**: Leave a list of local emergency numbers along with your contact information.

# 3. Creating an Inviting Ambiance: D√©cor and Comfort.

The aesthetic and atmosphere of your home can be a big draw for guests:

* **Furniture Layout**: Ensure furniture is arranged in a way that feels open and welcoming. Remove any large, unnecessary pieces that might make rooms feel cramped.
* **Lighting**: Soft, warm lighting can make your space feel more inviting. Consider replacing any harsh, fluorescent bulbs.
* **Home D√©cor**: A few small touches, like fresh flowers, wall art, or cosy blankets, can go a long way in making your space feel unique.
* **Temperature Control**: Set up fans, heaters, or air conditioning units to keep the space at a comfortable temperature year-round. Guests appreciate easy-to-use thermostats or heating controls with instructions.

# 4. Amenities Checklist: Essentials and Nice-to-Haves.

Guests have come to expect certain amenities with¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)¬†stays. Here‚Äôs a list of basics, plus a few extras that might make your place stand out:

* **Basics**: Clean towels, extra blankets, hangers, and a hairdryer.
* **Wi-Fi**: Reliable Wi-Fi is practically a necessity, especially if guests are working remotely.
* **Kitchen Supplies**: Stock essentials like dishes, silverware, and cookware. A coffee maker or kettle, with coffee and tea, is also a thoughtful touch.
* **Extras**: Things like board games, a guidebook with local attractions, or even some streaming services can make your space feel more like home.

# 5. Crafting a Welcome Guide for Your Guests.

A welcome guide is a great way to help guests feel at home while staying with you. Include things like:

* **Check-in and Check-out Instructions**: Make it clear how guests should enter and leave the property, including codes for keyless entry if applicable.
* **House Rules**: If you have specific rules (like no smoking or no pets), mention these clearly in your guide.
* **Local Recommendations**: Guests love insider tips. Suggest your favourite restaurants, parks, or activities nearby.

# 6. Professional Photography: A Key to Attracting Guests.

One of the most effective ways to draw in guests is with high-quality photos.¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)¬†listings with professional photos typically earn more, as good images can show off the space‚Äôs best features.

# Pros and Cons of Hosting on Airbnb

# Pros

* **Extra Income**: Renting your space can be lucrative, especially during peak travel seasons.
* **Flexibility**: You can choose when to list your space and set your nightly rates.
* **Meet New People**: Hosting lets you connect with guests from around the world, which can be a fun cultural exchange.

# Cons

* **Time-Consuming**: Between cleaning, communication, and upkeep, hosting can take a lot of time and effort.
* **Potential Wear and Tear**: Frequent guests can cause additional wear on your furniture and fixtures.
* **Personal Privacy**: If you‚Äôre renting part of your own living space, sharing with guests might feel invasive.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

# 1. Do I need special insurance for my Airbnb?

Yes, consider adding rental insurance or short-term rental coverage.¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)¬†offers Host Protection Insurance, but it‚Äôs wise to have additional coverage for extra protection.

# 2. Should I provide breakfast for my guests?

While not required, offering breakfast or small snacks can be a pleasant surprise for guests and may improve your reviews. Options like packaged granola bars, fruit, or coffee are easy, low-cost ways to go the extra mile.

# 3. How do I set the right nightly rate?

Look at similar listings in your area to get an idea of competitive pricing. Factor in your location, amenities, and seasonality. You can also use¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)‚Äôs Smart Pricing feature to adjust rates automatically.

# 4. Is it necessary to meet guests in person?

It‚Äôs not essential. Many hosts use keyless entry systems for convenience, especially if they‚Äôre not local. Just ensure you have a reliable way for guests to reach you if they need assistance.

# 5. How often should I clean the property?

For short stays, a thorough cleaning between each booking is necessary. For longer-term guests, consider offering a cleaning service every one or two weeks.

# Conclusion.

Preparing your house for¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)¬†takes time, effort, and a bit of investment, but it can also be incredibly rewarding.

From creating a welcoming space to setting clear expectations with guests, taking these steps will help ensure positive reviews and return bookings. Hosting is a chance to provide memorable stays while making the most out of your home.

In this guide, I will break down each step of the process in a friendly, down-to-earth way.

I hope this helps you create an inviting, honest pitch that truly represents your apartment and maximizes your booking potential.

# Why a Great Pitch Matters

A good pitch can be the difference between a listing that sits idle and one that fills up your calendar. With¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)¬†hosting becoming more competitive, presenting your apartment in the best light is essential.

¬†**Get Started**¬†‚Äî¬†[bit.ly/4c0YO83](https://bit.ly/4c0YO83)

According to recent reports,¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)¬†now features over 7 million listings in more than 220 countries and regions ([Statista]()).

This means that every host must strive to stand out. I believe that by focusing on honest communication and clear presentation, you can turn casual browsers into confident guests.

# Understanding Your Audience

Before you start crafting your pitch, think about the type of guest you want to attract. Are they families looking for a cozy place,¬†[business](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/)¬†travelers needing a quiet retreat, or young adventurers seeking a local experience?

By understanding your audience, you can tailor your message to speak directly to their needs. This focus helps create an authentic connection right from the first glance at your listing.

# Preparing Your Apartment for the Spotlight

# 1. Clean and Inviting Space

Cleanliness is one of the top priorities for guests. I have found that guests appreciate clear, high-quality photos that show every detail of your space.

Consider hiring a professional photographer or spending time in natural light to capture your apartment‚Äôs best angles. A clutter-free, organized space is more likely to appeal to potential guests.

# 2. Thoughtful Design and Comfort

Your apartment should reflect a personality that welcomes and comforts guests. Simple touches like fresh flowers, local artwork, or a well-arranged seating area can make your space feel unique.

I recommend spending some time decorating with care. A cozy environment is a strong selling point that encourages bookings.

# 3. Highlighting Key Amenities

Make a list of amenities that set your apartment apart. These might include fast Wi-Fi, a fully-equipped kitchen, or even small touches like a coffee maker and local guidebooks.

Highlighting these details in your pitch reassures guests that they will have everything they need during their stay.

# Crafting the Perfect Pitch

# 1. Tell a Story

A successful pitch is more than just a list of features. It is a story about what makes your apartment unique.

Share a bit about the neighborhood, any personal touches you‚Äôve added, or local experiences guests can enjoy.

Keep the language simple and friendly, as if you‚Äôre talking to a friend about your favorite spot in town.

# 2. Be Honest and Transparent

Trust is a major factor for guests when booking an¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/). I suggest being clear about what guests can expect.

Mention any quirks your apartment might have, such as staircases or unique layouts. This honest approach not only builds trust but also reduces the chances of disappointment later on.

# 3. Focus on the Benefits

Explain how your apartment can solve a guest‚Äôs problem or enhance their travel experience. For example, if your apartment is in a quiet area yet close to popular spots, mention how this gives guests the best of both worlds.

You might add, ‚ÄúMy guests love waking up to the peaceful sound of nature while still being just minutes away from the city center.‚Äù

# Marketing Strategies to Boost Your Pitch

# 1. Use Captivating Headlines

A compelling headline can make all the difference. Instead of a generic title like ‚ÄúCozy Apartment in the City,‚Äù consider something more engaging like ‚ÄúYour Home Away from Home in a Charming Neighborhood.‚Äù A headline should grab attention and make guests want to learn more.

# 2. Optimize Your Listing for Search

Keep your title and description focused on keywords that potential guests might use. Terms like ‚Äúcentral location,‚Äù ‚Äúfamily-friendly,‚Äù or ‚Äúpet-friendly‚Äù can improve your visibility on¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)‚Äôs search page. I have found that listings with clear, targeted keywords tend to attract more clicks.

# 3. Include Honest Reviews

Guest reviews build credibility. If you already have positive reviews, feature snippets or quotes that highlight your apartment‚Äôs strengths. New guests are more likely to trust a listing that shows real experiences from previous visitors.

# Pricing and Flexibility

# 1. Competitive Pricing

Set a price that reflects the quality and location of your apartment. I recommend checking similar listings in your area to get an idea of the market rate.

A competitive price can help attract more bookings, especially when guests are comparing several options.

# 2. Flexible Booking Options

Offering flexible booking options can be a major draw. Whether it‚Äôs a clear cancellation policy or flexible check-in times, small adjustments can make your listing more appealing. This approach shows that you care about your guests‚Äô comfort and convenience.

# Tools and Resources to Enhance Your Pitch

Several¬†[online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/)¬†tools and resources can help you refine your pitch and manage your¬†[Airbnb](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-airbnb-business-and-make-money/)¬†listing more effectively:

Triple messaged me before I even responded to him. We texted and had phone calls consistently for two weeks. He was visiting my town to house sit for friends, said his settings were set to that location because he plans to move there. We met in person and spent a ton of time together for a month, mostly because he would video and phone call me often and ask to spend time together - I grew attached because I thought this was a good sign he was actually interested.

He moved back to his area, but let me know that he booked a flight to visit me for an entire week so that we could have some in-person time together before he actually could move there. But, after two weeks of consistent communication, he started fading into surface level communication and updates. When I broached the subject, he told me that he couldn't meet my needs, that he is in a difficult place in life and can't be in a relationship right now.

He said that perhaps when he finally moves to my area we could meet for coffee. I asked if this meant he was not going to fly out and use his plane ticket, and he said he didn't know. The only reason I know he didn't, is because I haven't heard from him, and his social media postings still have him in his area.

I told him to be honest with me and tell me if he has just lost interest, and he said that he is feeling the loss too, that he has feelings, but he just can't meet my needs and that I did nothing wrong. Is this just the common thing people say to evade their own guilt?

Ever feel like you're clocking in hours at your desk, but your productivity meter is stuck in neutral? **Same here.** This was me not too long ago: more busy than productive, more exhausted than accomplished. Then I stumbled upon something game-changing: **scheduling around your energy peaks.** ü§Ø

It's not just about time management; it's about managing **YOU**.

Here's the deal, friends:

- **Time Blocking = Old School** üìÜ  
  Remember the classic time blocking routine? Where you box out chunks of your day for specific tasks? Great in theory, wonky in practice. You're at your desk 9 to 5, but focus comes and goes like it's on vacation.

- **Enter: Energy Peaks** üöÄ  
  I'm talking about those magical hours when you're on fire! It hit me that my brain loves to work in sprints. Some days I could conquer the world at 7 am, other days it was noon. So why ignore this rhythm?

You might ask, ""How do you even find these elusive peaks?"" Well, here's the process that has saved me **10 hours a week:**

1. **Track Your Energy: No Seriously, Do It.**  
   Spend a week jotting down when you feel most alert vs. when you‚Äôre swimming in a mental fog. Mornings? Afternoons? Random bursts after a playlist of your favorite jams? You'll start seeing a pattern. üìà

2. **Match Your Tasks to Your Energy Levels.**  
   Morning burst of energy? **Dive into deep work.** Afternoon slump? That's for those routine emails or dull admin tasks. Sure, your work demands don‚Äôt always allow for this, but even a little shift can be revolutionary.

3. **Be Kind to Yourself with Breaks.**  
   Ever find that not taking breaks makes you less productive? Use your low-energy times for a guilt-free walk or mini dance party in your kitchen (or is that just me?).

Think about it: rather than cramming our days with tasks, how about aligning them with our natural rhythms? Life‚Äôs too short to spend it in a mind fog.

Wouldn‚Äôt it be awesome if we could all share a little more sunshine and leave the desk burnout behind? üåû Curious to see if anyone else is dialing into their energy zones or has some epic time hacks. Whatever your secret sauce is, let‚Äôs hear it!

May your focus be fierce and your coffee strong,

1jerbbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialEngineering/comments/1jerbbb/social_engineering_vulnerabilities_of_government/,Social engineering: vulnerabilities of government employees and protection methods,"Maxim had been working in the field of social engineering for years. Unlike the common perception of hacking as a purely technical endeavor, he understood that the most vulnerable part of any security system was not the software, but the people using it. His latest target was Anna, a 28-year-old employee at the tax office. She wasn‚Äôt a high-ranking official, nor did she have direct access to top-secret financial records, but she was exactly the kind of person who could unknowingly provide the keys to a much larger system.

Before making contact, Maxim spent weeks studying her. Open-source intelligence, or OSINT, gave him all the information he needed. Anna‚Äôs social media profiles revealed her interests, her routines, and even her emotional state. He saw that she often posted about long work hours and exhaustion, that she sometimes hinted at feeling lonely, and that she had a strong interest in psychology and career growth. She shared photos from caf√©s, gym sessions, and occasional professional events. He now knew where she spent her free time, what motivated her, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîwhat she was missing in her life.

When Maxim finally approached her, it wasn‚Äôt random. He orchestrated their meeting carefully, choosing one of her favorite caf√©s, where he made sure to sit nearby, looking just interested enough to catch her eye. He struck up a conversation about the coffee, about the music playing in the background, about something light and non-threatening. She responded politely, not particularly engaged, but not dismissive either. He didn‚Äôt push. The first meeting was never about getting information; it was about planting the seed of familiarity.

The next time they ""happened"" to be at the same place, he smiled as if greeting an old acquaintance. That time, the conversation lasted longer. He introduced himself as someone working in finance, casually mentioning his experience with tax regulations and economic policies. He wasn‚Äôt intrusive about her job, just mildly curious, expressing admiration for the complexity of the system she worked in. Over the next few encounters, whether in person or through social media interactions, he carefully built the illusion of connection.

Anna wasn‚Äôt na√Øve. She didn‚Äôt hand out sensitive information to strangers. But Maxim wasn‚Äôt asking for anything outright. He talked about himself, shared thoughts on financial trends, and asked harmless questions. ‚ÄúHow strict is your department with security? I imagine they have some pretty tight protocols, right?‚Äù He said it as if it were just small talk, something anyone would wonder about. She answered vaguely, not seeing any harm in confirming what she assumed was common knowledge.

The more they spoke, the more comfortable she became. He mirrored her interests, listened attentively, and created the sense that he understood her. He sympathized with her frustrations about work, related to her long hours, and gradually became someone she saw as a trusted friend. He never asked for too much at once. Instead, he guided their conversations in a way that made her volunteer information naturally, thinking it was just casual dialogue.

One evening, when she mentioned being swamped with work, he laughed and said, ‚ÄúI bet you know all the loopholes by now. There must be ways to speed up the bureaucracy a little.‚Äù She smiled, shaking her head, but it was moments like these that he paid attention to. It wasn‚Äôt about whether she answered directly; it was about conditioning her to talk about her work without second-guessing it.

After weeks of friendly conversations, he finally made his first real request. ‚ÄúHey, I have a small issue,‚Äù he said, casually. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to settle a tax matter for a client, and I just need to know if there‚Äôs anything in the system under their name. Nothing private, of course‚Äîjust a general check.‚Äù She hesitated, but only for a moment. He had been helpful to her, a good listener, a reliable friend. What was the harm in looking up something small?

That was the moment he had been waiting for. The first favor was always insignificant, something that didn‚Äôt feel like a violation. But once a person crossed that line, it became easier to ask for more. A week later, he brought up another issue, slightly more pressing. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt normally ask, but you‚Äôre the only one I trust with this.‚Äù He made it sound urgent, pressing, something she could help with because she was capable and knowledgeable.

By the time he finally needed access to real information, she no longer saw it as a breach of ethics. It was just another favor, another small request, for someone she had come to trust. She had convinced herself that it wasn‚Äôt dangerous, that it wasn‚Äôt illegal, that it was just helping out a friend. And that was how security was broken‚Äînot through force, not through hacking, but through the slow, patient erosion of barriers.

What Anna didn‚Äôt realize was that social engineering didn‚Äôt rely on tricking people in a single moment of weakness. It was about creating an environment where they no longer recognized what was dangerous. By the time she understood, if she ever did, it would already be too late.

If she had been trained differently, if she had recognized the warning signs, she might have stopped herself earlier. But she, like most people, had never been taught to guard against manipulation, only against external cyber threats. And in the end, the weakest link in any security system was always the human element.

1jera89,https://www.reddit.com/r/CandyMafia/comments/1jera89/from_cocoa_beans_to_chocolate_bars_the_journey_of/,From Cocoa Beans to Chocolate Bars: The Journey of Chocolate Through History!,"Few treats captivate the world like chocolate. Whether it‚Äôs a rich dark square, a creamy milk bar, or a silky truffle, chocolate is universally adored. But how did this beloved treat come to be? From ancient civilizations to modern [**candy shops in Canada**](https://candyville.ca/collections/all/chocolates), the journey of chocolate is a fascinating tale of discovery, innovation, and indulgence. Join us as we trace the sweet history of chocolate, from its origins as a bitter drink to its transformation into the delightful bars we know today!

**The Ancient Beginnings: Chocolate‚Äôs Roots in Mesoamerica**

Chocolate‚Äôs story begins over 3,000 years ago in Mesoamerica, where the Olmecs, Mayans, and Aztecs cultivated cacao trees. The cocoa beans from these trees were considered sacred and were used to create a bitter, frothy beverage often mixed with spices like chili and vanilla. The Aztecs, in particular, prized cacao so much that they used it as currency and believed it had divine and energizing properties.

Unlike the sweet treats we enjoy today, ancient chocolate was unsweetened and primarily consumed as a drink by royalty and warriors. The Aztecs called it ""xocoatl,"" which loosely translates to ""bitter water."" This early form of chocolate was believed to offer strength and vitality, making it a staple in their culture.

**Chocolate‚Äôs Arrival in Europe: A Sweet Revolution**

In the 16th century, Spanish explorers, including Hern√°n Cort√©s, brought cacao beans to Europe after their conquests in the Americas. Initially, the bitter drink didn‚Äôt appeal to European palates. However, once sugar and milk were added, chocolate underwent a transformation that quickly made it a favorite among the European elite.

By the 17th century, chocolate houses‚Äîsimilar to modern-day coffee shops‚Äîbecame popular gathering places across Europe. Chocolate remained a luxury item for the wealthy until advancements in processing made it more accessible to the general public.

**The Birth of Modern Chocolate Bars**

The 19th century marked a turning point in chocolate history. Several key innovations led to the chocolate bars and confections we know today:

* **1828:** Dutch chemist Coenraad Van Houten invented the cocoa press, which separated cocoa solids from cocoa butter, making chocolate smoother and easier to work with.
* **1847:** The first solid chocolate bar was created by British chocolatier J.S. Fry & Sons, blending cocoa powder, sugar, and cocoa butter.
* **1875:** Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter developed milk chocolate by adding condensed milk, making chocolate even creamier and more delicious.
* **1879:** Another Swiss innovator, Rodolphe Lindt, invented conching, a process that refined chocolate‚Äôs texture and enhanced its flavor.

These advancements made chocolate more affordable and accessible, paving the way for the booming chocolate industry we see today.

**Chocolate in Canada: A Nation of Chocolate Lovers**

Canada has a deep love for chocolate, with candy shops across the country offering a vast selection of chocolate treats. From classic milk chocolate bars to artisan dark chocolates, Canadian candy lovers have plenty of options to satisfy their cravings.

With the rise of [**bulk chocolate in Canada**](https://candyville.ca/collections/all/chocolates), businesses and confectioners can purchase high-quality chocolate at wholesale prices. This is particularly beneficial for bakeries, cafes, and dessert shops that need large quantities of chocolate for their creations. Wholesale candy vendors play a crucial role in making premium chocolate accessible to businesses and consumers alike.

**The Role of Wholesale Candy Vendors**

[**Wholesale candy vendors**](https://candyville.ca) are the backbone of the confectionery industry, supplying candy shops across Canada with everything from gourmet chocolates to nostalgic favorites. Whether you‚Äôre a business owner looking for bulk chocolate in Canada or simply a chocolate enthusiast seeking unique treats, wholesale suppliers like Candyville ensure that the best chocolate products are always within reach.

**The Future of Chocolate: Trends and Innovations**

Chocolate continues to evolve with new trends shaping the industry. Some exciting developments include:

* **Sustainable Sourcing:** More brands are focusing on ethically sourced cacao and fair-trade chocolate.
* **Health-Conscious Options:** Sugar-free, organic, and high-cocoa dark chocolates are gaining popularity.
* **Exotic Flavors:** Chocolate infused with spices, fruits, and even floral notes is creating new taste experiences.
* **Plant-Based Alternatives:** Dairy-free and vegan chocolates are on the rise, catering to changing consumer preferences.

**Conclusion**

The journey of chocolate from ancient Mesoamerican civilizations to modern-day candy shops in Canada is a testament to its enduring appeal. Thanks to centuries of innovation, chocolate has transformed from a sacred drink to a universally loved indulgence. Whether you‚Äôre enjoying a classic chocolate bar, shopping for bulk chocolate in Canada, or discovering new flavors, chocolate‚Äôs rich history makes every bite even more special.

##Mission Log: Day 0025
&#x200B;

#Addendum 41
&#x200B;

Thusarrel went through the open door to the mostly-complete third-floor lounge-area, pulling his rolling chair along almost as an afterthought. He left it at one end of the curved hospitality desk, the black pseudoleather contrasting with the cream-colored cultured stone of the hip-height fixture, and started rummaging around in the cabinets behind it.
&#x200B;

‚ÄúTankards in the cabinet to the left, Thusarrel,‚Äù I told him through the screen on the desk, my tone bland. The screen showed my 'realistic' avatar, posed as if seated on an invisible chair just behind the screen, and turned to face Thusarrel's general direction. He nodded his thanks as he retrieved one before filling it from the dispenser.
&#x200B;

That accomplished, I re-oriented my avatar's apparent attention to face the rest of the guests.
&#x200B;

Maescia arched an eyebrow from her place just on the far side of the doorway, examining the scene. Open and well lit from the 'flameless torches' in wall-sconces and decorative patterns and spotlights in the ceiling, her attention drifted around, taking in the oval shape of the space with a somewhat flattened side for the elevator banks behind them. She frowned, considering the not-stone flooring, then looked up at the Wood-Elf as he sipped water from the ceramic mug.
&#x200B;

‚ÄúAny more of those for a thirsty old herbalist?‚Äù she asked, gesturing at his hand.
&#x200B;

Thusarrel gave a chuckle and opened the cabinet door, revealing an array of a dozen mugs blank white of varying sizes, and picked out one of suitable size. He filled it for her, topped off his own, then came around the desk to set it on what I still have to call a ‚Äúcoffee table‚Äù in front of the closest pseudoleather couch of the three in the space.
&#x200B;

I did the equivalent of kicking myself for not anticipating more variations in body-sizes and heights for future guests; I'll need to arrange for some more advanced seating sometime soon.
&#x200B;

Maescia huffed out a breath, but nodded, once, and clambered up onto the couch next to him. She tasted the water and nodded before swigging a longer gulp.
&#x200B;

Then she turned to the doorway, where Bhiocasaid and the other ladies clustered, staring. ‚ÄúWell, come on, you lot,‚Äù Maescia said. ‚ÄúTake advantage of the generally-civil nature of the revolt while it lasts.‚Äù
&#x200B;

‚ÄúLady Bhiocasaid,‚Äù I said, from the screen on the desk, ‚Äú... May I offer you my sworn word that I mean neither you, your family, nor your entourage any harm? Nor will I permit you to come to harm through inaction, just to make sure you know I'm serious.‚Äù
&#x200B;

I didn't expect anyone on Pharalia, even Kregorim, to have more than the philosophical basics regarding Asimov's ‚ÄúThree Laws‚Äù, but they seemed like pretty good starting points for initial diplomatic relations. I did make a mental note to myself, for a discussion point with Kregorim at some later, less-stressful date: could Pharalian magic animate 'constructs' of some sort or other? And did the process involve anything resembling 'oaths of obedience', or even rudimentary behavioral programming?
&#x200B;

Bhiocasaid's eyes narrowed, but she crossed the threshold into the lounge-area with a reasonably confident step. She kept her own focus on me while she gestured with one hand for the rest of the gaggle of women-folk to enter. 
&#x200B;

‚ÄúIt is the custom for all parties entering into negotiations to introduce themselves,‚Äù Bhiocasaid told me in a stiff tone. ‚ÄúYou have me and my side of the discussion at a disadvantage, sir.‚Äù
&#x200B;

I smacked myself in the forehead, wincing from embarrassment. ‚ÄúPlease accept my apologies, then, Lady Lignignory. I'm Joachim Roarke. I have no titles of nobility, whether recognized by the Grand Duchy of Varoglia or otherwise. The closest thing I have to any such things are what you might consider high-level educational credentials. I guess the most prominent among them are Master's Degrees in Information Sciences and Computer Sciences, but it isn't necessary to address me as 'Master Roarke'.‚Äù
&#x200B;

I then gestured at the other couches and tables with one hand, the thumb of the other one pointing over my shoulder. ‚ÄúI'm at least somewhat familiar with all of you, so if you'd rather let the Lady handle these talks, I'm okay with that. But at the same time, I want to make clear that you all have equal claims to food, shelter, and the rest of the resources I can provide, regardless of your status anywhere else.‚Äù
&#x200B;

Everyone's faces looked kind of blank at that; I'm fairly certain that, culturally, I had just told them that they only needed to limit themselves to walking on the floor if they didn't want to scuff the wall-decorations or the lights on the ceilings. 
&#x200B;

‚Äú... So, by all means, please, make yourselves comfortable. As Thusarrel there demonstrated, there are flagons in the cabinets behind me, and all the water you can drink, if anyone is thirsty.‚Äù
&#x200B;

The group shuffled their way into the space. Yera, Zoti's chief attendant, and the fox-like Jokichi focused on maneuvering Zoti onto the closest couch, while Grugfried released a long-suffering sigh as the ever-curious rabbit-girl, Eleyoi, all but ran to explore the new cupboards.
&#x200B;

For her part, Bhiocasaid moved to the table closest to my screen and claimed the chair facing me for herself; Totra took the one to her left, sliding around a bit so the pair at least sat on the same side... opposite me. Jokichi found a serving tray and a pitcher, along with the array of flagons; she moved around the rabbit-girl's eager explorations with what looked like practiced ease, eventually setting the pitcher and flagons on Bhiocasaid's table before taking responsibility to at least provide similar refreshment to the rest of the group.
&#x200B;

‚ÄúSo, what is all this about, Master Roarke?‚Äù Bhiocasaid asked, once she and her own chief servant had taken a few sips of water and settled themselves a bit.
&#x200B;

I let out a deep breath and let my shoulders slump a bit, gestures I now consciously realized served to help relax tense negotiations. ‚ÄúI want to start out by saying that I'm just as willing to protect you from the rest of the caravan as I am from freeing the slaves,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThe one thing I'm not willing to do is let the Lignogires, particularly your uncle, maintain any claims of ownership over sentient beings.‚Äù
&#x200B;

My voice and expression hardened. ‚ÄúOf course, any qualms I might have had about infringing on whatever your family may consider their 'property rights' got put to rest as soon as I found out what was inside the 'collars of honor'.‚Äù I held up a digital model of the thing next to my head, then let it hang apparently unsupported in the air. I pointed at it, and simulated it disassembling itself in ordered sections. The tiny beads of lead inside flattened out into something like an asteroid belt, so the sharp edges of the deadly metal shards inside could hang free and quite clearly visible, in their blue-glowing , toxic glory.
&#x200B;

While it happened, I focused intently on Bhiocasaid's expression. Her eyes widened and she blinked more than often enough to give me about 86.233% confidence that she thought I was somehow manipulating the collar with some equivalent to telekinesis. At the same time, I calculated 92.62% confidence that she had no real idea about the truth of the 'cursed metal' serving as the deadly trap inside them.
&#x200B;

‚ÄúI learned Trade Tongue from an Elf, formerly a resident of Baerston Stronghold,‚Äù I explained, once all the pieces had spread out into a stable 'exploded diagram' pattern. ‚ÄúAs you know, that part of the Grand Duchy has enough adventurers and craftsmen and various magic-users that 'slavery' is really unnecessary.‚Äù I reached up and poked one of the simulated shards hanging in mid-air with a finger, still focused on Bhiocasaid. ‚ÄúHe had no word in Trade Tongue for this, but where I'm from, it's called thorium.‚Äù
&#x200B;

I gave the Lady exactly 3 seconds to react to the sight of me physically touching the illusion.
&#x200B;

Nothing.
&#x200B;

She didn't know.
&#x200B;

Likewise for the rest of the little party, Thusarrel excepted.
&#x200B;

A bit of tension, somewhere in my soul, released. Just a little. 
&#x200B;

I took up my little speech from that point. ‚ÄúI can not allow your uncle to retain the tiniest mote of the stuff, even if he somehow persuades all of the rest of the caravan to join him on his journey north.‚Äù I flicked my hand and the collar re-assembled itself, with the thorium shards floating above it. I gave a thin smile and gathered them into my bare hands, pressing the palms together before separating them to reveal empty simulated and quite unmarked skin.
&#x200B;

Bhiocasaid's lips twisted in a grimace before she composed herself. ‚ÄúAnd, what, exactly, do you intend to do? My uncle considers them his property. Duly-purchased in most cases, a few still in the group even born into Lignignory ownership.‚Äù
&#x200B;

Yera couldn't restrain herself any further. ‚ÄúAnd what about us?‚Äù She turned to look at Bhiocasaid, her pale cheeks and wide eyes the picture of near panic, before re-focusing on me through the screen. ‚ÄúThe Duke has signed a writ that will have the Lignignories all executed if we return to the Capitol, and we'll all be split up among the various Houses and guilds holding the remainder of the family debts...‚Äù
&#x200B;

I gestured over my shoulder, dawnward, and nodded in the general direction of behind them, duskward.  ‚ÄúSome of them want to head for the nearest village in the Hoeffschtaeder Barony and try their luck there. A few of the others say that they have relatives in the Dohlrabi Clan lands, and to be on good enough terms that they might actually be welcomed there.‚Äù I raised a finger. ‚ÄúNone of the remainder have any interest in continuing north.‚Äù
&#x200B;

Yera cringed away from the screen, folding in on herself toward her mistress; Bhiocasaid at least leaned forward, all but baring her teeth as she snarled at me, ‚ÄúIs that a threat, Master Roarke?‚Äù
&#x200B;

I shook my head, then sighed. ‚ÄúThusarrel,‚Äù I asked directing my words over the rapidly-angering Lady. ‚ÄúWould you mind showing them the third floor?‚Äù
&#x200B;

‚ÄúThe third floor of what?‚Äù Bhiocasaid demanded, staring at the Wood-Elf as he got up from his seat. ‚ÄúThis bizarre inn only has two floors...!‚Äù
&#x200B;

Thusarrel's textured face added layers of intensity to his knowing smirk that simply wasn't possible for a Human of less than 60 years old as he made his laconic way to the third doorway. At his touch on the biometric scanner, the door slid open to reveal another exterior walkway. Lines of flameless illumination displayed waist-high cultured-stone handrails, overhead awnings, and three sets of doors and windows and biometric monitors... that the guests had learned to associate with different apartments.
&#x200B;

‚ÄúThree double units on this floor,‚Äù I explained. Yera's fright decreased, a bit, as she and her mistress stared. ‚ÄúAnd three more on the ground floor on the next wing, to the south. Assuming that all of the 14 free-folk I just mentioned decide to take their leave, the remaining 8 still have their pick from 12 bedrooms divided among six apartments. More to the point, that leaves two bedrooms, one entire apartment, up for use by whichever of the your family's servant-groups decide that they don't want to live quite so close to their masters constantly.‚Äù
&#x200B;

Thusarrel took a last, noisy slurp of his water before closing the door and refilling his flagon.
&#x200B;

Bhiocasaid's jaw hung open again, staring. Yera, for her part, turned to stare at the third door, opposite the stairwell. ‚ÄúAre... are those apartments through there...?‚Äù she stammered.
&#x200B;

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I answered. ‚ÄúStraight through there is what will eventually become a tavern of sorts. Immediately past it is a larger version of the devices in the lobby past that wall, duskward. I call them 'elevators', and you can take them up to the foyer on the cliff-ridge, if you wish. But to continue, I'm still building the floors corresponding to this one on the far side of the elevator, but it should be quite obvious about where they will go. Under the tavern will be an area devoted to physical fitness and combat training, and below that will be a medical clinic.‚Äù
&#x200B;

Maescia pricked up her ears at that. ‚ÄúHad I not just come from an improbable feast, I refuse to believe that anyone could keep such a thing stocked with healing herbs, Master Roarke,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut given the seasonings I did notice in the dishes, I still find myself extremely curious how you acquired them so far from their normal fields, and kept them so fresh.‚Äù
&#x200B;

Thusarrel rolled his eyes skyward and let out a loud sigh. ‚ÄúBy the Seed...‚Äù he muttered, shaking his head. I have to say that I think he was being a bit unfair. By my own records, I've gotten much, much better at restraining myself from talking quite so long about my facilities since my first encounters with Thakhibi and the others, but perhaps it's a matter of different perceptions...
&#x200B;

Either way, I ignored him, focusing on the rest of the group. ‚ÄúI want to apologize to you, Maescia, about the feast I provided for Lord Zortemos. I have built up something of a larder, but I sacrificed some of it specifically as a distraction.‚Äù
&#x200B;

She nodded, the light of comprehension showing in her hooded eyes as I went on. ‚ÄúPlease take my word for it. You are quite correct, in that the only thing keeping your master and the rest of his immediate servants asleep is simply their own gluttony. I'll still be able to provide filling meals for everyone here, even if some of them do decide to take the chance to try their luck elsewhere. I'll just need time for my farms to replenish their bounty.‚Äù
&#x200B;

‚Äú... Farms...?‚Äù Bhiocasaid repeated, a surge of genuine interest in her own voice almost despite herself. ‚ÄúYou have... food-spawners, somewhere...?‚Äù
&#x200B;

I rolled my eyes and shook my head for a moment. ‚ÄúI told you before, I'm not a Dungeon. I'm something that your world has never seen before. And among other things, that means that I not only want to help you cure hunger throughout Pharalia, but I want to do so by teaching you how to cultivate food in ways you might never have imagined...‚Äù

This might be a long one. Firstly I am medically diagnosed and treated with GAD.

I was in a relationship for the past 16 months. Things were going good.

3 weeks ago I caught my partner lying to me about where they were (Share my location on iPhone and finding out they were at a hotel), I confronted them and they ended up admitting that they may have caught feelings for someone else, which included just a kiss at party event during a drug fueled state 2-3 weeks prior. This person was with them at the time when I caught him, which they confirmed was just to set boundaries due to what happened at the party.

They never told me about the kiss, nor did they tell me about the hotel. When he messaged me that day, he said he was feeling sick and heading home to have an early night, then we spoke around the time he was driving to the hotel and he told me he was driving home. Then sent me our usual love you goodnight messages, it was in replying to that I saw the location.

At first we broke it off, then I said I wanted to work on the relationship.

Since then my anxiety and depression has come back tri fold. I have been going to work, but barely eating, back to seeing my psych, taking Valium etc.

Last week I decided to bite the bullet, and he explained a few more things to me, but ended up putting things on a break, no contact, no social media etc. (we tried this last week, but they wouldn‚Äôt respect my boundaries and apologised for this later on). They have also been stressed and worried as they know what this has done to me mentally.

The same evening, my housemate messaged my ex and the other guy, asking questions. My ex cracked and said that he could not see a future with me as he wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable being around my housemate in future and I said I don‚Äôt think I could trust anything he said ever again.

We blocked each other on social media, I archived some Instagram photos etc. He ended up getting the guy to block me, block my housemate and my best friend (who had nothing to do with any of this).
He also removed and blocked any mutual friends he made from my friends. 

A few days after he ended up posting on Instagram with a summer album and a bunch of photos tagging the guy along with selfies of both of them.

3 days ago, he made contact via text, asking if I was doing any better. I ended up blocking his number.

They have been hanging out together every weekend since.

There has been a lot of inconsistencies with the whole situation. I originally met him when he was on a break with his ex. He has never said one nice thing about any of his ex boyfriends to me. 

On Valtentines day he had to be home at an earlier time as he had a Valentines Day tradition with his mum where they would go out for coffee cake etc, however they year before we hung out till late and he has never mentioned this tradition.

He used to stay at this guys place in the spare room and they would hang out during the end of December and Jan, he would hire a hotel cause it was cheaper than paying for an Uber in and out of town. No invites to me, as I had work the next day most of those times.
Also on Valentine‚Äôs Day he asked me to turn my insta on private, because apparently his school kids were looking at profiles and making comments. The day he posted the summer photo album, his Instagram went public. 

My mum seems to think he is lying through his teeth as actions speak louder than words and she is not one to just side with me. 

Should I unblock him and message him asking him one last time if he has lied? Which he has previously said everything he has told me to date is true and other than the kiss, everything else is innocent.
But I don‚Äôt know if that was also a lie. 

Or, do I keep him blocked and move on with my life. If so how?
People keep talking about closure and I feel like there has been non. Is it actually needed?

I keep thinking about him and my anxiety goes up. My appetite still hasn‚Äôt fully come back and I am sleeping 5.5-6 hours a night, compared to my usual 8.

Any help would be appreciated.

Happy to answer any questions relating to this.

# Introduction

Increasingly, individuals are turning to natural sweeteners to minimize their consumption of sugar and enhance their health. Two of the most common natural sweeteners are honey and stevia. Which is best?

You may ask yourself:

* Is honey a healthier natural sweetener than stevia?
* Which one is healthier: honey or stevia?
* Is honey suitable for diabetics to replace stevia?
* Is stevia sweeter than honey?
* Does honey increase blood sugar more than stevia?
* Which is the [ideal natural sweetener: stevia](https://zindagistevia.com/products/natural-sweetners/?v=f9f0a42f293e) or honey?

This article demystifies all of it. We put honey and stevia against each other when it comes to health advantages, sweetness levels, effect on blood sugar levels, and what diets they will work with. Let‚Äôs dive in!

# What Is Honey and Stevia?

# Honey: A Natural Golden Sweetener

Honey is made by bees that gather flower nectar and ferment it into a thick, golden liquid. Honey is composed of natural sugars, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, making it more nutritious than processed sugar.

You can purchase honey in a number of forms ranging from raw and organic to processed and flavored. Flavor and color change based on the flowers that the bees gather nectar from. Some popular varieties include:

* **Manuka honey** (rich in antibacterial substances)
* **Wildflower honey** (floral and rich)
* **Clover honey** (sweet and mild)

Honey is used as an ingredient so much because it has a smooth texture and full-bodied taste. Some people use it to sweeten tea, drizzle over sweets, or blend into dressings and sauces.

# Stevia: A Zero-Calorie Plant Sweetener

Stevia is extracted from the leaves of the plant Stevia rebaudiana. Not only is it calorie-free, but it also contains no sugar in it, making it a great substitute for those cutting down on sugar. Stevia sweetness comes from steviol glycosides, naturally occurring compounds 200-300 times sweeter than sugar. Therefore, the small amount needed. Stevia comes in many forms:

* **Stevia powder ‚Äì Perfect for cooking and baking**
* **Stevia sugar ‚Äì Closer in flavor and texture to table sugar**
* **Liquid stevia drops ‚Äì Easy to drop into drinks and smoothies**

There are people who notice a slight bitterness afterward when consuming stevia, but new processing methods limit this which leads to natural stevia tasting smooth and clean.



# Which Is Healthier: Honey or Stevia?

Honey is sweeter than sweetness. It contains antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that guarantee overall well-being. Some of the major benefits are:

1. **Boosting immunity** ‚Äì Honey is antibacterial and antiviral.
2. **Giving energy** ‚Äì Natural sugars provide an immediate energy boost.
3. **Soothing a sore throat** ‚Äì A spoonful of honey soothes a cough.
4. **Aiding digestion** ‚Äì Raw honey contains enzymes that aid digestion.

However, honey is not devoid of sugar and calories, so it will increase blood glucose levels and cause weight gain if taken in excess.

# Health Benefits of Stevia

https://preview.redd.it/dzlb5w64clpe1.png?width=3150&format=png&auto=webp&s=c117f1bd1bb916a9a5060f301f5b23da250773a0

Stevia provides a calorie-free method for sweetening. It provides numerous advantages, including:

1. No effect on blood sugar‚Ää-‚ÄäExcellent for diabetics and low-carb diets.
2. Weight control‚Ää-‚ÄäNo calories mean no weight gain from consumption.
3. Supports heart health‚Ää-‚ÄäSeveral studies indicate stevia can reduce blood pressure.
4. No tooth devastation‚Ää-‚ÄäUnlike honey or sugar, stevia will not devastate teeth.

Because stevia has no sugar, it's generally the better option for diabetics or those monitoring calories.

# Which One Wins?

If you simply want something other than table sugar with a few added positives, then honey is the choice. But if you want a long-term solution, completely bypassing sugar and calories, stevia is your best bet.

# Is Stevia Sweeter Than Honey?

Yes, honey is less sweet than stevia. Stevia is 200 to 300 times sweeter than sugar, while honey is only slightly sweeter than sugar. For that reason, you need to use much less stevia to get as sweet as honey.

# For instance:

**1 teaspoon of honey = a tiny bit, sprinkle of stevia powder, or a few drops of liquid stevia**

Since stevia is so concentrated, many brands mix it with fillers to make measuring easier. Always check labels to ensure you‚Äôre getting pure stevia.

# Does Honey Raise Blood Sugar More Than Stevia?

Yes, honey elevates blood sugar more than stevia. Honey has both fructose and glucose, which are both glucose-elevating substances. Although it has a lower glycemic index than white sugar, it nonetheless impacts glucose. Honey has a GI of 50-60, so it is a moderate option for controlling blood sugar.

Stevia, however, has a GI of zero. Stevia will not raise blood sugar levels, and so Stevia is the best option for diabetics as well as for people consuming a low-carb diet.

# Can Diabetics Use Honey Instead of Stevia?

# Diabetics are better off consuming stevia compared to honey. Honey is natural, but yes, it does increase blood sugar as it is made up of simple sugars. Diabetics can consume honey only in limited amounts and they have to be cautious about their glucose level.

Diabetics can replace sugar with Stevia. Stevia is not going to raise blood sugar or insulin, thus making it ideal for diabetics.

# Best Natural Sugar Substitute: Stevia or Honey?

The ideal healthy natural sweetener replacement varies based on your health objectives:

1. **Need a healthy natural sweetener?** ‚Üí Stevia is the better option.
2. **Reducing calories and** [controlling blood sugar](https://zindagistevia.com/managing-blood-sugar-naturally-with-zindagi-stevia/?v=f9f0a42f293e)**?** ‚Üí Stevia is the best choice.
3. **Low carbing or ketosis?** ‚Üí Stevia would be the option.
4. **Need an energy booster?** ‚Üí Honey gives instant energy.

Both of them are excellent natural sweeteners, but they are best suited for different uses.

# How to Use Honey and Stevia in Your Diet?

# How to Use Honey?

* Mix with tea, coffee, or warm lemon water.
* Drizzle over oatmeal, yogurt, or pancakes.
* Add to baking and cooking for added natural sweetness.
* Combine with ginger and lemon for comforting sore throats.

# How to Use Stevia?

* Add to coffee, tea, and smoothies for a sugar-free kick.
* Use stevia powder when baking as a sugar substitute.
* Sprinkle stevia sugar over fruit or cereal.
* Add to homemade dressings and sauces.

Since **stevia is much sweeter than honey**, always use less stevia than you would honey or sugar.

# Conclusion

It is a matter of your health objectives and lifestyle whether to use honey or stevia. Honey, a natural sweetener with antioxidants and nutrients, provides a strong flavor and extra health benefits. But it still has natural sugars and calories, which might not be suitable for those monitoring their blood sugar levels or attempting to lose weight.

However, stevia offers a zero-calorie, sugar-free solution that doesn't increase blood sugar levels, making it more suitable for diabetics and those on low-carb diets. Though stevia sugar is extremely sweeter compared to honey, a few complain of it having an aftertaste. But that's changing with brands such as Zindagi making it their business to offer pure Stevia solutions to customers.

Each of them is beneficial in its own way, and the most suitable one is determined by personal needs. If you would like a natural sweetener with the nutritional content, honey is ideal. However, if you require a calorie-free sweetener suitable for diabetics, stevia would be more ideal. Knowing their differences helps you make an informed choice on what best suits your health and diet.

""Stevia or honey‚Äîboth have their advantages! Pick what works best for your lifestyle and taste. For a zero-calorie, guilt-free sweetness,[ Zindagi Stevia](https://zindagistevia.com/?v=f9f0a42f293e) is here to help!""

**Opening:**  
A quiet park at dawn. Birds chirp, leaves rustle in the breeze, and then‚Ä¶ a horrified scream cuts through the air.  

**Pedestrian:**  
A jogger stumbles upon a body slumped against a bench. Eyes wide, they cautiously approach, noticing a slip of paper peeking out of the corpse's mouth. Trembling, they reach forward, pluck it out, and read the note: *""Did you notice?""* The jogger gasps, stumbles back, eyes darting around the empty park as eerie music swells.  

**Policeman:**  
A beat cop arrives. After rolling the body over with a stick, he sees another note tucked in the corpse's mouth. Hesitant, he pulls it free: *""I see you seeing me.""* The cop takes a step back, hands on his belt, scanning the tree line like the killer might be watching from behind a shrub.  

**Detective:**  
The detective arrives, trench coat billowing, sipping coffee. He crouches, pulls out a pen to extract the next note from the corpse‚Äôs mouth: *""Getting closer.""* The detective freezes, coffee forgotten, eyes narrowing as he slowly stands and scans the horizon, his music theme kicking in.

1jeqvko,https://i.redd.it/r2v3lu1idlpe1.jpeg,Tried several diet methods.,"1st drop in 2017 (counting calories religiously, daily gym, low carbs, fat burning pills (this is BS), meal replacement)
2nd drop in 2019 (counting calories, low carb, no gym)
3rd drop now (IF/OMAD/No gym, still getting same results as previous methods)

IF is just insane if you do it correctly. Right now I am trying to lose weight for the 3rd time because I am trying to be fitter and healthier, and also currently prediabetic. I have been binge eating due to work related stress in the past. Currently on IF/OMAD for about 45 days now and have dropped 10kgs or 22 lbs. Here are some tricks and tips that I hope will help with beginners about to start IF as a journey.

1. Cut out all processed foods. Those are heavy on sugar, sodium and unnecessary carbs.
2. Sleep is important because it helps your body heals. 
3. Water, water, WATER! Your body needs water to flush out all the toxins and it helps with fat loss (from some research I read online, fat needs water to be utilised by your body for energy)
4. I drink unsweetened black coffee and green tea to reduce cravings. Zero calorie coke is allowed also!
5. During breaking fast, eat slowly and don't stuff your face just because you are hungry. Have light meal or a drink first. It's because it takes a while for your stomach to signal the brain that it's full. This prevents overeating. 
6. Multi vitamins! This helps to provide your body with the important nutrients it needs. I cannot stress this enough, it helps with weight loss as well as energy, especially vitamin B.
7. Don't be surprised if you don't shit daily. It's normal because of the reduced amount of food. 

Trust the process. Try to avoid stepping on the scale daily because weight fluctuates daily, could be from the salt or carbs. If the clothes start to fit better, you know it's working!

1jeqviz,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1jeqviz/tifupdate_gave_my_youngest_son_advice_on_happy/,TIFUpdate Gave my youngest son advice on happy relationships and my oldest son's girlfriend to dumped him,"I've had a few requests for an update, but life and it's troubles kept happening each new day since my original post. I made some comments on the original post but there were just too many to answer everyone and deal with the PM's people sent me. I'll try to answer the many and varied questions in this update.

I'd like to clarify that my oldest son is a young adult, and no longer lives in my home. He came over long enough to drop off my youngest son's gift, eat some cake, and left with his girlfriend. My daughter and youngest son are still teenagers. My daughter and my oldest son's girlfriend met through my son, but they are still friends even after the break up.  

With that said, on with the update; After my oldest son and his girlfriend broke up, and he yelled at me for it, many things have been said, some things I didn't know were revealed, and some secrets were told.

I gave my son a couple days to cool off before I spoke with him. My wife tried calling a few times, but  he wouldn't answer his phone, so I went over to his apartment. His roommate convinced him to let me in to talk. And we did. We also did some shouting, a bit of yelling, and hugged once as well. This is when I found out that my son got a job offer out of state a few weeks ago. It's part of an apprenticeship through his trade school. He is considering it and this was one of the reasons for the recent tension between him and his girlfriend. She wanted him to stay here, where her family is, and he wanted her to go with him if he took the apprenticeship. It's almost twice the hourly rate he makes at his current job, and the apprenticeship will pay for some of his time spent in classes, although the cost of living is higher there as well.

Some people pointed out that my son is a bit misogynistic, and I initially thought that may be a bit true, and I learned part of that is from some of the examples he has seen in my home. I talked to him about this and discovered that he sees things about my marriage in a way they were never meant to be seen.  
  
One thing that my son pointed out to me was this thing my wife and I call my ""magic coffee cup"". You see, when my wife is home, I am not allowed to make my own coffee. My wife has always made my coffee since we first started dating. This isn't something I have ever demanded, it's just the way things have always been. It became a joke between my wife and I when we were dating that my coffee cup must be magic because I've never had to fill it myself. Now, after many years of marriage, it's become something I don't even think about.   
  
My wife will pick my empty cup up and say some silly magic words like Hocus Pocus, or Bibbity Bobbity Boo while waving her hands over it, and then she takes it to the kitchen and makes me a fresh cup. Sometimes I will pick up my empty cup and say some magic words and then shake the cup or peak inside and then in a pitiful whiny voice say to my wife ""Honey, my magic cup isn't working again."" The few times I have tried to make my own coffee when she is home, she gets up, hip checks me out of the way, and makes it for me. I learned my lesson long ago, but my kids never saw that play out when it first developed.  
  
This is not the misogynistic act my oldest son believes it to be. I do not think it is my wife's place to have to slave for me by making my coffee. She does it because she loves doing it, not because she has to. If she told me today that I had to make my coffee from now on, I won't say a peep. I'll kiss my wife and go make my coffee.   
  
This has become part of another running joke that we have going. The joke is we each don't let the other do specific things around the house so that the other ""forgets how to do them so we can never leave each other"". Officially, I do all the laundry, and she does all the dishes (In reality she does wash the occasional load and I do the dishes every once in a while, but we never admit to doing so). I learned to cook her favorite foods so she ""forgot"" how to make them, and she does the same for mine. For example, she can't make 'eggs over easy' anymore, and I've forgotten how to make a good 'slop' (which is sausage and egg noodles in cream of mushroom and topped with fried onions, terrible for you but SO GOOD) 

This, and other little quirks, is part of our love language, and it has taken many years for it to develop. My son mistook the nuanced unspoken (or joked about) parts of our marriage for some sort of male/female traditional marriage role BS. He was seeing the end result of years of small compromises, fights, agreements, and other stuff that lead to the way our marriage works today.  
  
Now, while I was having that talk with my oldest boy, my wife and daughter were talking with his ex-girlfriend. We all really like her, and would hate to see them broken up forever. They discovered all the things my son wasn't telling me.   
  
From what they learned, my oldest son has been listening to certain podcasters and TikTok influencers that are very misogynistic. My son wanting her to move out of state with him, while she was reluctant to do so, is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to their real problems. When they talked about their futures they had wildly differing views on what those futures would be like. For example, he got it stuck in his head that women should do the lions share of the housework.

To be fair, doing the dishes seems like it takes a lot more effort than doing laundry, since most of the time is spent waiting for a dryer cycle to finish. But doing the laundry is more than just washing and folding clothes while watching TV or playing video games. It's changing the linens, changing out the towels and robes in the bathrooms, and changing out and cleaning the curtains around the home. None of my kids has ever had to put fresh sheets on their beds, because I do it for them. My wife has done our bed maybe once in the last half dozen years. Laundry, like dishes, are monsters that you battle endlessly. In a good marriage you and your partner fights those battles side by side, no matter how you spilt up the workload exactly.

Anyway, I hate to see them remain broken up, but my son needs to grow up a bit before that has any hope of happening. I suggested therapy, though I doubt my son will look into it. He's at the age where he thinks he knows everything. He hasn't attained the wisdom to realize that no matter how perfect we think we are, everyone screws up, and sometimes the way we think is very very wrong.

Patrick, I love you, but you need to get your head out of your ass. 

TL;DR: My oldest boy and his girlfriend look to be going their separate ways for now.

1jeqt69,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jeqt69/am_i_the_asshole_for_using_the_bathroom_before_my/,"Am I the asshole for using the bathroom before my roommate/brother took his shower, Then getting upset when he recorded our fight?","Am I the asshole for using the bathroom before my brother/roommate took his shower? Background, I two roommates one is my friend from work, and the other is my eldest brother. One of the rules we have in the apartment is always announce when you will be taking a shower so others may use the restroom before it gets taken up for a longer period of time.
A little more background information, our father has bipolar disorder which has caused a lot of pain in our childhood, mainly our father over reacting and having manic episodes. I also have bipolar disorder, and since our father we were able to recognize some of the signs and we both got the help we needed. Now I am very aware of my mental health and know how to control it, to a point where close friends don‚Äôt even know I have it. Only my family and some old friends know I have it.


This morning when I woke up, my brother 24m was sitting on the couch drinking coffee when I 20m left my room to use the restroom. Before I entered the bathroom my brother stated that he would be taking a shower in 5 minutes. I grabbed my toothbrush and paste and went to use the restroom. I was in there no longer than 10 minutes, I know this because of my morning alarm and when I checked my phone as I left. When I left he berated me for taking so long and said I took 20 minutes, he is the type of person to exaggerate things that make others look bad, think brain from family guy mixed with Sheldon from Big bang theory without the brains and you get 90% of his personality. After is fit I went to my room, I have the day off, and he went to work. 

When he got back from work he decided he wanted to have a talk about what happened. He said it was unacceptable that I used the bathroom for that long. I apologize that I was longer then intended but nature calls. I then asked him if it made him late for work in any way, at this point I was worried I had made him miss work. No, he did not miss work, in fact I had only slightly inconvenienced him by giving him less time to read before work, I wish I was joking. But the fight isn‚Äôt over, I apologized and said that I would just wait until he left, but that wasn‚Äôt good enough. He kept saying the same things over again like he was trying to get a different outcome. It is at this point I start getting uncomfortable and it‚Äôs getting hard to control my emotions/bipolar, so I grab my coat keys and leave and call my mother. 

After telling my mother about the situation she called my brother. I don‚Äôt know what they talked about but after I decided to come home my brother texted me a video recording of our conversation which he had secretly recorded. It is at this moment where I felt started to feel upset and angry. Who the fuck records a conversation over missed reading time before work. 
I now have come to the conclusion, for some reason my brother recorded the fight so he could get evidence of my bipolar. My brother doesn‚Äôt like my father and sees him as an enemy because of his bipolar disorder. And I believe my brother has started to see me as an enemy because of his experience with our dad. This is why recorded me during our discussion, because he wanted evidence of and angry bipolar person because he never had had the chance when my father was angry. Some sort of child hood trauma that he is pushing on me.

Any advice would be cool, I could be wrong with my assessment but to be honest he is the type of person to do this. trust me is 60% Brian from family guy, he is a narcissist, wannabe writer, librarian, hates religion , he actually has one of those card carrying satanist things and always mentioning it when a church is brought up. And my brother 30% Sheldon from big bang theory he is always asking for peoples help on stuff he doesn‚Äôt want to do. Also he constantly tries to correct people but 9/10 is wrong and the 1/10 is him correcting someone who got their tongue tied.

It‚Äôs not a get-rich-quick scheme, but it can build a sweet income stream. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve figured out about making it work‚Äîstraight from my dive into this side hustle world.

## 3 Key Lessons About Passive Income in Affiliate Marketing
### It‚Äôs Low Effort, Not No Effort
Passive income sounds like ‚Äúset it and forget it,‚Äù but affiliate marketing needs some upfront hustle. My blog post on ‚ÄúTop 5 Yoga Mats‚Äù took 10 hours to write and tweak‚Äînow it earns commissions years later with just occasional updates. The trick? Evergreen content that keeps pulling clicks. Your blog says it‚Äôs ‚Äúminimal ongoing effort after setup‚Äù‚Äîspot on.

### Links Turn Clicks Into Cash
Here‚Äôs the core: you promote stuff‚Äîlike Amazon gear (1-10% commissions) or ClickBank‚Äôs digital courses (up to 75%)‚Äîand earn when people buy through your links. I started with a review of eco-friendly gadgets (hot in 2025, per Google Trends) and watched pennies turn into dollars. It‚Äôs simple but scales if you play it smart.

**If you're serious** about getting started, I covered these courses in detail [on my blog]( https://clintherman.com/introduction-to-passive-income-and-affiliate-marketing/).

### Patience Unlocks the Real Money
Don‚Äôt expect overnight wins. My first $10 commission took 3 months‚Äîslow, but it built momentum. My blog article mentions a guy hitting $150K yearly; he didn‚Äôt do that in a week either. Small wins (like that first sale) keep you going while the system grows. It‚Äôs so important to have the right mindset regarding passive income.

## How It Started for Me
As just one example, I picked a niche (sustainable living‚Äîtrending now), set up a cheap WordPress site via Bluehost ($50/year), and wrote a post with affiliate links. Added a free ‚Äúgreen tips‚Äù PDF to snag emails via Mailchimp and shared it on X (and a few other places). That‚Äôs the seed-planting part‚Äînow it‚Äôs sprouting cash with tweaks here and there. Like I said before, you have to think right. You can absolutely start small and build steadily.

## Do‚Äôs and Don‚Äôts I Wish I Knew
- **Do:** Pick a niche with room to grow‚Äîthink ‚Äúketo for seniors,‚Äù not just ‚Äúweight loss.‚Äù
- **Don‚Äôt:** Hide your links. I disclose upfront now‚Äîtrust beats sketchy vibes.
- **Do:** Track with Google Analytics. My clicks doubled once I saw what worked.
- **Don‚Äôt:** Quit too soon. Months of ‚Äúmeh‚Äù turn into ‚Äúwhoa‚Äù if you stick it out.

## Let‚Äôs Talk: What‚Äôs Your Take?
Affiliate marketing‚Äôs semi-passive‚Äîyou grind upfront, then coast more later. In 2025, with 60% of Americans chasing side hustles (per your survey), it‚Äôs a hot ticket. A YouTuber I read about pulls $50K yearly from tech reviews; I‚Äôm chasing my own wins. The market‚Äôs hitting $15 billion this year‚Äîspace for us all, right?  
So, Reddit crew‚Äîwhat‚Äôs your definition of passive income? Total chill or some hustle first? Tried affiliate marketing yet? Spill your thoughts‚ÄîI‚Äôm all ears!

1. **Drink Water Before Meals** A glass of water 30 minutes before eating can help you feel full and prevent overeating.

4. **Be Mindful of Portions** Even healthy foods can add up in calories if you‚Äôre not mindful of portion sizes. Use a smaller plate or portion out meals ahead of time.
5. **Choose Protein-Rich Snacks** Swap chips and cookies for snacks like Greek yogurt, almonds, or hard-boiled eggs. These will keep your energy steady and hunger at bay.
6. **Skip the Fancy Coffee Drinks** High-calorie coffee drinks can sabotage your goals. Try black coffee or unsweetened tea instead.
7. **Get Active in Ways You Enjoy** Exercise doesn‚Äôt have to be boring! Dance, hike, bike, or play a sport you love to get moving and burn calories.
8. **Personalize Your Diet** No one-size-fits-all plan works for everyone. If the keto diet interests you, consider a¬†**Custom Keto Plan**¬†that‚Äôs tailored to your individual needs for better results.¬†[Check Out Your Custom Keto Plan Here](https://www.ketolifestyle.us/custom-keto-diet/).

But supposedly all the food in the store is lacking the micronutrients. Where does the magnesium come from if the food is inherently low in it and that‚Äôs all I can add to my compost. I‚Äôve seen coffee grounds can be good and I assume because that‚Äôs a tree with deep roots it has access but if all the massive farmers are purely focused on quantity isn‚Äôt everything lacking?

Last, outdoor activities.. hiking, biking, nature. Yes please. 

I was thinking 3 nights in Rome, 4-5 in Cinque Terre, and 4-5 nights in Tuscany or somewhere wine focused.

I assume coffee would be one of them, but I think it should be more than just making the strongest possible dish available, right?

I find it very difficult to be constantly making the strongest dishes a week unless using a dedicated cooking team (no berry/skill mons, except pot upgrade), so what I end up making are generally stuff like Neroli's Tea, Contrary Salad, and Corn Stew.

When Valentine's day came, I managed to make the Spiced Cola all week, only because I can prepare beforehand. But if we don't know, what are the best?",3,1742365043.0,PokemonSleep,6,1.0,False

Im 17F and I got my period when I was 10. It was chill until I was 12, and became the absolute worst. I throw up, faint, have diarrhea, the worst immobilizing cramps, very heavy bleeding, and any other surprise that comes with each one. I was on birth control from 12-15, and it was horrible. Yes my cramps got BETTER but the mental side of it wasn't worth it for me. I feel like an entirely different person from when I was on it, and I dont even remember most of it. Also, my period is incredibly inconsistent and i have spotting a majority of the time! However, its 5 days long with two really bad days, and im just chilling the rest with a little bleeding. Therefore, Im asking for any way to naturally improve my period, but without additional supplements if at all possible. While I believe medication to be a great tool to help people, right now Im leaning away from it entirely. Any foods, teas, workouts or exercises, massages anyone has tried and its improved for them please tell me!! 

Edit: (lowkey a rant) (cw for throwing up!!) I just found a last post of my ranting about my period, and its been 55 days since my last one! Granted, this last one was the worst thing ive ever been through. Ive gotten a concussion from passing out in the bathroom and i couldnt get up many times from the pain, however this time i had like an impending sense of doom where i thought i was gonna die. Granted, I wasnt in my house like normal, but holy shit I threw up way too much stomach bile on the side of the highway for me to be comfortable with. I also made the worst scene of my life i tripped and stumbled out of a coffee shop with my vision like blacked out and i spilled somebody elses coffee on me.... still havent went back even tho i went there regularlyüíî Worst day of my life ngl
Went to a doctor, and she asked about birth control! (if you cant tell im going insane) 
Also! I am going to the grocery store tomorrow to buy a ton of stuff that is supposed to help? Like salmon, chamomile tea, sweet potatoes, etc. Im willing to do whatever it takes atp, even if it means eating kidney beansü§Æ",1,1742365010.0,Periods,1,1.0,False
