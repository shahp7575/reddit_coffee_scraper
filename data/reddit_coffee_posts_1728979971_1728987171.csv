1g446jk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Serverlife/comments/1g446jk/a_funny_thing_that_happened_to_me/,A funny thing that happened to me,"I work in a small pub in rural England. The chef‚Äôs good at his job so we got a rep for good food, and we‚Äôre connected to a fancy hotel across the road. Needless to say, we get customers expecting a (perhaps unrealistically) high standard from what is essentially a very traditional rural pub.

Anyway, the other day a very old couple come in from the hotel and order lunch. They‚Äôre pretty rude in the way many old Brits are, complaining about the lack of variety; they wanted a roast (English pubs mainly only serve roasts on Sundays). They finally settled on fish and chips.

At the end of the meal, I ask them if they want anything else, and they say absolutely nothing, just stare at me. I leave them be and start dealing with some other tables, when the bloke calls me back and just says, ‚ÄúCoffee. Black.‚Äù

I‚Äôm like okie dokie but cause he caught me in the middle of doing something else, I forget about it for a bit. Maybe 7 minutes later he‚Äôs at the bar.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my coffee?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh I‚Äôll just grab it for you‚Äù

‚ÄúNo never mind, just give me the bill‚Äù

So I feel a bit bad now but also don‚Äôt really give a shit cause he‚Äôs been nowt but rude so far. When I do give him the card machine, he pays and surprisingly leaves a ¬£7 tip, not too shabby for England.

However, as he is leaving, apparently, he told my coworker that the tip is for her (she didn‚Äôt touch his table) and I‚Äôm not to get any of it.

It was just funny cause thats not at all how our tips work. Irritatingly, they‚Äôre shared between us, the hotel, and another failing pub down the road. I get 1p for every pound. The base pay is good enough tho so I don‚Äôt desperately mind.

It was quite nice tbh cause it helped me realise that playing for tips is kind of pointless here. I can be friendly to customers, which I honestly like doing, but also not put up with rudeness for a 7p tip.",1,1728986795.0,Serverlife,0,1.0,False
1g445ll,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1g445ll/choosing_three_tea_types_for_a_tasting_service/,Choosing three tea types for a tasting service,"Hi folks. So two of my friends are now aware of my tea obsession and want a tasting/education session on Gongfu tea, tea culture, history, processing, science, etc. I'm well versed in explaining these things and hosting people for tastings but usually we just have one tea type at a time, or compare two teas of the same type. 

These two friends are a speciality coffee roaster and a fine dining chef, so their tastes will likely be more discerning. As such id like to have a service of three tea types to give them a better idea of the spectrum of flavour profiles, brewing apparatus, etc. that are out there. 

If you had to choose three tea types to serve in such a situation, what would you serve to represent a wide spectrum of flavours and aromas? I will have examples of all 6 tea types available for them to at least smell the dry leaves, but was thinking of actually drinking just 3. 

Early on I'm thinking:
- White or Green (probably Bai Mu Dan, or Longjing)
- Black or Oolong (Probably a Dancong, Jin Jun Mei, or an unsmoked Lapsang)
- Shou Puerh (being coffee people they are very excited about the prospect of a fermented tea)

Thoughts and advice is appreciated!",1,1728986687.0,tea,0,1.0,False

1g443tp,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1g443tp/sudden_amsterdam_layover_urgent_advice_needed/,"Sudden Amsterdam layover, urgent advice needed ","Despite waking up at 2am, getting to the airport early and setting up camp at the gate a half hour before boarding started, I somehow managed to miss my flight this morning. The most upsetting and shameful part is I. Was. Sitting. Right. There. The. Whole. Time. 

It was my second super early morning flight in a row (woke up at 4am yesterday to fly from Paris to BCN) so I‚Äôm beyond tired. 

Now instead of leaving BCN at 6:20a and getting home to California by noon today, I‚Äôm leave BCN at 5pm, flying to AMS, where I‚Äôll land around 7:30pm, have a 13.5 hour layover, and finally get on my 11 hour flight home at 9am tomorrow. 

I miss my dog.

Im very much a budget traveler but broke down and sprang for the extended lounge pass (all 106‚Ç¨) here in BCN so I can take a shower and eat and charge my phone and not have to worry about anyone stealing my stuff if I pass out or am not paying attention (cus clearly I am not on the ball today)

I‚Äôll be honest, it was very much worth it. I may take a nap here after my shower but I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôll miss my flight again so I doubt it‚Äôll be very restful sleep.

Here‚Äôs where you, experienced, intrepid traveler, comes in. I need your advice. What should I do for accommodation in Amsterdam tonight? Is it safe to sleep at Schiphol? Is there a good lounge open overnight that offers paid day-passes? I‚Äôm down to get a room, but the last time I had a long layover there (mumble mumble) years ago, I stayed at the Yotel in the airport, and they want close to 300‚Ç¨ for a room tonight, which is way out of my budget.

4 hours ago, when all this went down, and mid-panic attack, visiting a coffee shop on an impromptu AMS layover seemed like an excellent if not necessary idea, and I figured I‚Äôd get a hotel room at the airport, take public transit into the city center, spend a few hours indulging in the local tourist culture to help take the edge off and ease the blow of this sudden turn of events, public transit back to the airport around 9:30 or 10, sleep 6 hours, get up, catch my flight, and boom I‚Äôm home. This seemed smarter than trying to find somewhere to stay in the center of town. Now I‚Äôm just so tired. And rambling. So I‚Äôll stop here. What do you suggest? Try sleeping in the terminal? Lounge? Nearby airport hotel? If so, which one? My budget is roughly up to 100‚Ç¨, tho I‚Äôd like to keep it under 60‚Ç¨, and can go as high as 140‚Ç¨ if need be.

1g4434z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g4434z,Park Hyatt London Review,"I stayed over the weekend at the newly opened Park Hyatt London located in the Nine Elms area of London, next to the US Embassy. The location is a little out of the way compared to other luxury hotels. It‚Äôs approximately 10 mins walk to the nearest tube at Nine Elms. 

First impressions: Arriving at the driveway of the hotel which is shared with another tower and the PH Residences, staff rushed out to greet me in my Uber. Both the Guest Relations Team Leader Hannah and a doorman greeted me and asked for my name to escort me to the front desk. Both were genuinely excited to be welcoming a guest to the hotel.

Check In: Was handled at the front desk where passport and credit card were verified. Staff explained the facilities available and open. I was then escorted to my room by Hannah.

Service: This is what will make or break any luxury hotel. The staff are clearly well trained and proud to be working here. Everyone I came across addressed me by name and were genuinely interested in how my day was going. We had problems with the air conditioning in my suite and they were unable to repair it, so they moved me to an identical suite 3 floors higher the next day. There was good follow up by the front desk following the first engineer‚Äôs visit to see if the problem had been resolved, though am surprised they didn‚Äôt verify directly with the engineer, but maybe that was their way of being proactive. Service recovery of moving to another similar suite was good, and they helped with the move. I had hoped that they might move me to one of the nicer suites considering the inconvenience, but not a big deal as it was such a short stay. 

Room: I was upgraded to Park Suite River View. Had used a SUA since I have spare expiring carts, but likely not needed as they had the space in the end. Right now, both the Park Suite and Park Suite River View are standard suites despite a $300 price difference. The suite is compact with decent views of the river. I think it would be hard to fit a rollaway here, but they say you can for families. The floor to ceiling windows are soundproofed and the doors are extra thick and very quiet consequently. Hardwood floors in the living room, carpet in the bedroom and marble tile in the bathroom. The floors laid out in a herringbone pattern, which looked nice. There‚Äôs a walk-in closet off the living room and the bathroom is attached to bedroom with the 1 toilet accessible from the living room too.

Nespresso coffee and teas available and a well-stocked minibar. Luxurious leather ice bucket as well as leather coasters.

The room‚Äôs lights and curtains are all touch operated on the wall. An outlet with USB A & C provided by the bedside. A missed opportunity was to include an international outlet. adapter available upon request.

Bathroom: The suites have Japanese style toilets, with wireless remote control which is a nice feature to have. There were no heated floors, or a TV in the mirror or speakers in the bathroom, which you often find in many luxury hotels. I think this was a missed opportunity. Not a big deal but I know many luxury hotels now include that. The inclusion of a claw foot bathtub enhanced the look of the bathroom. No branded robes or slippers yet. Maybe those are coming?

Interestingly they have a cordless hairdryer with lots of attachments but isn‚Äôt a Dyson unlike many other luxury hotels. Not a big deal for me but might influence others.

Welcome gift: Welcome wine and raspberry covered Madeline‚Äôs we‚Äôre waiting for me on check-in. The wine at retail is about ¬£7 which for a luxury hotel is super cheap, so they need to up their game. For comparison on a recent stay at Corinthia hotel they offered a bottle of champagne. Same at Great Scotland Yard, a sister Hyatt property.

Turndown service: Offered the first evening with slippers and water placed by bedside. Curtains down. Second night they forgot to do the turndown.

Restaurant & Bar: Breakfast in the hotel restaurant which was covered as a globalist. Continental buffet was set out and then you order hot dishes a la carte. I ordered eggs Benedict as my main dish. The eggs were perfectly cooked (which is a pet peeve of mine when yolk isn‚Äôt runny). The brioche was a little thick but seemed homemade. With one person managing tea and coffee I think that‚Äôs going to be a bottleneck when they‚Äôre busy. If you‚Äôre not staying as a Globalist or have it included in your rate you can order a la carte still.

Bar is quite large, and the artwork pays homage to auto parts and the old Rolls Royce factory that used to be here. Most importantly the bartenders can make a good martini!

Pool/Gym: Taking up the entire first floor the space is very welcoming. They‚Äôve got a lot of good equipment in the gym with views onto a construction site. The pool is very bright and deceptively large. The depth was at most 5 ft at deepest. It gently gets shallower at one end, which does make swimming harder. They‚Äôve got kids hours for families which I‚Äôve noticed in more hotels now, especially in the UK. There was a funky smell which they claim is chlorine‚Ä¶ but last I checked chlorine doesn‚Äôt smell like sewer. Maybe I have an overly sensitive sense of smell, but I couldn‚Äôt enjoy my time in the pool area. The changing rooms have showers and segregated saunas which were broken on this visit.

Spa: Pricing was quite high, which isn‚Äôt surprising for a brand new luxury hotel. I didn‚Äôt get a chance to visit this time around. No offers for in-house guests or for those with loyalty.

House car: They have a car from 5-9 each night available for guests on a first come first serve basis. Unsure of limits. First night was a BMW i7. Second night was a luxury Range Rover.

Overall a lovely addition to the Park Hyatt brand and London. Would likely repeat for business rather than with family. ",5,1728986423.0,hyatt,0,1.0,False

My upstairs neighbors frequently toss their butts over their balconies into the garden (one of them also throws some of his/her used coffee filters, tea bags and rotten fruit, biom√ºll I guess). 

The facility manager is aware of the problem but only mows the lawn and blows leaves without addressing the problem. 

Dogs are walked in that area and outdoor cats like to hang out there, this can cause a serious problem if they ingest one of these cigarette butts or some coffee granules on top of being very unpleasant and possibly leaching toxic chemicals and plastic into the soil. 

What can I do in this situation? I‚Äôm unsure which specific neighbors are responsible. ",1,1728986407.0,AskAGerman,1,1.0,False

The most common type you are going to find is in  capsule form, but there is others like gummies, powder, etc. I'll break each one down.. starting with the one I recommend most which is [Self Obsessed](https://amzndp.com/B0CK8JPHQ2) - it's a multi-ingredient capsule that contains HGW and 9 other potent ingredients like shilajit, ashwagandha, tongkat, boron and more. I will also drop my favorite picks for powder and gummies. If you have any questions, feel free to drop them down below and i'll do my best to answer all of them!

I really really like these capsules.. These were the first HWG capsules I tried before self obsessed and they are a solid, more affordable option. Now, they don't contain 10 ingredients like self obsessed, but they do boast HGW, Tribulus Terrestris, Diindolylmethane, Tongkat, and a few others, so you are getting a good balance of ingredients. And of course they are capsules, so super easy and convenient to take.

**3 -** [Force Factor HGW Gummies](https://amzndp.com/B09W1R4JJ9) **‚Äî Best Gummy Option**

These are fcking delicious, probably the most irresistable supplement gummy I have ever had, which is saying something. So if you opt for these, make sure you can limit yourself to 2 a day, otherwise you may end up eating the whole jar at once. They contain HGW, Tongkat Ali, , Tribulus Terrestris, Fenugreek, & Black Maca, so it's a great option for those that like gummies.

You can check it out [here.](https://amzndp.com/B09W1R4JJ9)

**4 -** [Micro Ingredients HGW Powder](https://amzndp.com/B01L2TGSVM) **‚Äî Best Powder Option**

This is a great option that contains pure organic HGW with Active Icariins. It's filler free and is non-gmo. Super convenient if you are wanting to just mix it with coffee or a drink and take it on the go. The taste was barely noticeable for me personally, and you get a solid 1000mg serving, so if you want something you can mix with liquid, this is for you.

You can check it out [here.](https://amzndp.com/B01L2TGSVM)

I hope that helped a few of you who are in the market for hgw or have been wanting to try it! Any of these will be a good option to go with, but I am partial to self obsessed.

1g43ywd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1g43ywd/male_friend_making_weird_comments_i_am_in_a/,Male friend making weird comments (I am in a relationship),"I think I actually know the answer for this one, but I feel like I really need to vent and get some input from other ladies. I'm 35, I have been with my partner for 7 years and getting married. I have some great friends, but most of them are mutual friends of my partner. (we started dating after meeting in our friend circle). So I have found this longing to have friends who are just ""my friends"". I joined threads a few weeks back (the app) and started connecting with some people. A guy was being very funny and contact seeking. (a guess the first red flag) So we connected on instagram and started talking. I am very upfront about having a partner,  I post about it in my profile, so he knew I was not single. We share a lot of the same interests. He was newly single after 6 years and felt very lonely and friendless. I felt bad for him, as I could empathize being in that situation. (He is 41). He wanted to went some about his ex, we talked and joked. 

It seemed to be going very well and I was feeling excited to have a new friend. He was hilarious and would message me a ton, liking all of my posts instantly and coming with these funny remarks. I love people with humor so we clicked really well. He seemed interested in what I was doing during my day and as I said- reaching out a lot. We met for coffee in town, which went very well. He was being perfectly respectful and cordial, while talking about his animals a lot. (He lives alone with different animals, I am a huge animal lover myself).

Then the evening he messaged me a bit more, but then made an off-handed comment about my body as in ""it was hard to keep eye contact with me and not look at my chest"". I just kind of ignored the comment and we talked as normal (stupid).

He then made some more comments, as for instance I made a comment on a designers threads about this beautiful dress from one of my favorite books. It is very revealing but stunning, so I wrote that I love the dress but would only wear it at home. (Threads works a bit like, you can see what your mutuals comment on, so I was making a public comment on it) and he then messaged me privately that he would love to see me in that dress. I sent him back a gif with ""i dont think so"".

We kept chatting and he was having some issues with his bloodsugar levels (he is diabetic) and I was chatting to him about his anxiety with this and trying to be supportive. I asked what he could do to fix it and he said he would ride his exercise bike to bring it down. Then he sends me another message saying ""sex really helps with it too üòâ"". I commented back to him, that he should probably look for a friends with benefits situation with someone else then.

When we started talking, he said he was only looking for friends and not looking to date and he never felt like dating again.  I liked that as I feel it is easier to have male friends if they arent looking for romance.

The day after this, I talked to him and I was like. I am not ok with these sexual comments and any ""jokes"" he makes should be jokes he would be comfortable making in front of my partner, otherwise those jokes are clearly not okay. He apologized. I even said if he was really looking for a friend or something else? because I was only interested in friendship and if he wanted something more he was barking up the wrong tree. He said he was really only looking for a friend and that he would respect my boundaries.

Since then we didnt talk that much. He messaged a bit about his cat which is sick. I gave advice and sympathies. Asked a bit later how the cat was doing etc. Then I saw he had stopped liking my posts on threads (not selfies, but just posts about things) when in the past he would instantly like everything. I could see on his profile he was commenting on random crap on other people, so it wasnt that he was not on the app. I know he sees my posts from past interactions, so I just felt he purposely ignored my posts suddenly, because I told him off?

I decided to simply ask him about it, as that is how I am like. I made a joke about it and asked if we are cool. Since he just suddenly stopped. He gave me a kind of rude and aggressive reply back saying that he had been busy with his cat and had his mind on other things. Which granted makes total sense, expect for the fact that I could literally see him commenting random crap to other people on his profile.

  
My instinct right now is to just block him. I dont feel like he is a friend or friendship is what he was looking for. He also didnt respect my boundaries. Actually a thing he said very early on was ""dont block me over my jokes"". So i feel like perhaps he was simply testing the waters?

Am I overanalyzing? because I feel like him for instance not liking my posts at all is some passive agressive bs as well. One thing if you arent active on the app. But him getting likes on the app also seemed very important to him as he would send me a screenshot of how many likes one of his posts got.

1g43xcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stalking/comments/1g43xcp/my_boyfriends_upstairs_neighbor_is_stalking_him/,"My boyfriend‚Äôs upstairs neighbor is stalking him, and now she‚Äôs starting to include me in her messages‚Äîwhat should we do?","
My boyfriend and I have been together for about half a year, and we‚Äôre really happy. He told me early on that his upstairs neighbor was a stalker, but I didn‚Äôt take it too seriously at first. I thought it was just some girl with a crush. But after reading her messages and seeing how weirdly intense she is, I‚Äôm honestly scared now. I‚Äôd love to hear your opinions on this.

The story:

At first, my boyfriend and his neighbor were just that‚Äîneighbors. They lived in the same building for about two months without any issues. She‚Äôs a 35-year-old woman from Ukraine, who moved to Germany years before the war. She used to give motivational pep talks at seminars for immigrants (a really commendable job!), but she only did that a couple of times and has been home ever since. She lives above him in a small, single-room apartment, just like his. They initiated some superficial small talk and exchanged numbers in case one of them needed something or if something happened. For example, he texted her to let her know he‚Äôd be having a birthday party and that it might get noisy, or when he was about to drill holes into his wall for a shelf to check if it would disturb her.

Then, a bit later, she kind of switched‚Äîshe threatened to call the police on him because he used to smoke weed in his apartment. But since we live in Berlin, even the police don‚Äôt care about that, so she eventually dropped it. Still, she kept up this passive-aggressive attitude toward him‚Äîcomplaining about noise and criticizing him over random things.

One day, they ran into each other in the stairwell, and she invited him up for coffee to talk about ‚Äúgetting along better as neighbors.‚Äù So, they sat down, and she randomly started telling him about a phone call she‚Äôd just had with her father, where my boyfriend mentioned that his relationship with his mother isn‚Äôt the best (he‚Äôs very open and kind, and he doesn‚Äôt hesitate to speak about personal things, which I love‚Äîbut in this case, it might have given her the wrong signals). He barely remembers how they ended up talking about their family situations, but it was weird. He also felt uncomfortable at her place, which was sterile and obsessively clean.

That‚Äôs when the stalking started.

She began texting him all the time‚Äîtelling him to turn down his TV because ‚Äúthey‚Äù should go to sleep (I guess meaning her and him?). Then she‚Äôd say she could feel his ‚Äúenergy‚Äù through the walls, claiming she could sense when he wasn‚Äôt doing well. She even sent him a picture of her Christmas table, asking him to come up and have dinner with her. He called her and told her no, but that didn‚Äôt stop the messages.

It escalated further. She‚Äôd accuse him of ‚Äúpunishing‚Äù her when she overheard him sleeping with other women (he had some casual dates after parties). She started writing him letters with weird, alternating handwriting styles‚Äîtiming her entries, sometimes just 10 minutes apart. In the letters, she started getting way too personal, advising him to ‚Äújump over his mother‚Äôs shadow‚Äù and overcome his family issues. One entry she mentioned that he returned home at 2:41 AM, saying she could feel his ‚Äústrange energy‚Äù. And that his energy made her think of seeing a therapist together to ‚Äútalk without wanting to kill each other.‚Äù He was completely disturbed reading this, as he realized HOW deep her feelings go. Feelings from a woman he doesn‚Äôt even want to know.

In her letters, she also wrote bizarre things like how she didn‚Äôt want to use her ‚Äútoy‚Äù because she could feel that he didn‚Äôt want her to. She even left a self-help book about sibling relationships in his mailbox, telling him it helped her and that he should read it. At that point, he lost it, went up to her door, banged on it, but she stayed quiet. He ripped up the book and left it on her doormat.

The following year, for his birthday, she even put up garlands on his doorframe. She remembered his birthday because the year before he texted her about throwing a party and that it will get loud. She remembered it!! Some other day she left a cupcake on his doormat which he threw away, fearing it would be poisoned. 

All the while, the past three years, she stayed home all day. She has a little trampoline that she jumps on, and she seems to do it whenever we come home, like she‚Äôs listening for us. He told me back then that he had breakdowns over this‚Äîjust the constant presence and knowing she‚Äôs there, watching.

He hasn‚Äôt blocked her because he‚Äôs afraid she‚Äôll escalate further and find other ways to contact him if she can‚Äôt message him. He just tries to manage it, but the strain is real.

Now, she‚Äôs including me.

Since we got together, she‚Äôs been a little quieter, but she still finds ways to insert herself into his life. For instance, she‚Äôll take packages for other neighbors and leave them on his doormat, texting him about it to have a reason to reach out. The other day, she sent this message while we were out:

‚ÄúTell your girlfriend thank you. It‚Äôs about time the two of you understand that a connection from you to me is unwanted. I‚Äôm saying this with a hint of sadness and nothing else. You have to accept my boundaries, if not respect them.‚Äù

The thing is, I‚Äôve never even spoken to her. She‚Äôs also technically my neighbor because I live in the building across the courtyard, but the fact that she‚Äôs now bringing me into her delusion is terrifying. It feels like she‚Äôs creating this whole dynamic where she thinks she‚Äôs part of our relationship, when in reality we‚Äôre strangers.

What do I do?

I‚Äôve done some research, and it seems like she could be an ‚Äúintimacy-seeking stalker.‚Äù But should I be scared? My boyfriend has told her so many times that he‚Äôs not interested in her and that she needs help, but she‚Äôs completely unselfaware and refuses to see it. She almost seems narcissistic, like she thinks she‚Äôs important in our lives. I don‚Äôt believe that she will stop or reflects her behavior, and that her message was just a try to gain control over a situation that only exists in her head.

What should we do? Should we try to talk to her again, or is that just making things worse? Should we involve the police? I‚Äôd appreciate any advice, especially from people who have been in a similar situation.

1g43xaf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g43xaf,Blind Spot near Centre appeared.,"Hello, guys, after a strenuous move, the next day I got a blind spot in my left eye below the visual center. It flickers when you look at a white wall and blink. It also glows briefly when you close your eyes. Whole letters disappear where the spot is. So it's a scotoma I think.

I have three of these spots on my right. The first one appeared about 20 years ago. They are permanent but they are hardly bothersome anymore, apparently my brain has gotten used to them. Some of them disappear completely. 

What's noticeable is that the spot almost always appears after a very stressful phase or when you drink a lot of coffee, for example. That makes me think of retinopathy centralis serosa, but there is no evidence of that from an ophthalmological point of view.

So what else could it be? 

I'm looking for like-minded people with similar experiences.

I recently went to the
ophthalmologist but he couldn't find anything, he also did an OCT. But he wants to dilate my pupils again in the next few weeks and look at them with a microscope. According to him, the OCT was normal. He said, he suspects something in the vitreous body. But I can't imagine that. Vitreous body condensation doesn't happen overnight, does it? 

Sorry for that long text. Also I used translator üòÖ

I have added pictures of the Oct and an example of how I see the blind spot.

So here's the situation,

I (35m) working met somebody (25f) studying fashion in October last year. Everything I could ever want in a woman. We got together pretty fast, we got physical really fast, just two in love inseperable people.

Ater a few months I sometimes felt like I was giving more than her. she never really wanted me to invest in her. I don't mean going on fancy dates or buying her things, I mean emotionally. While also she was very very reciprocal for love and affection. She had her way of showing it but it was just always less. I even threw out an I love you, but never got it back. Already some red flags. Mind you I was never really all over her constantly, I gave her enough freedom and space.

She's an expat studying here, so during the summer she went back to Spain to visit her family for three whole months, she never asked me to come with her, but she did send me updates of her life there. So I feel she kept me secret to her family this whole time. Cause when she got back she came with her dad who stayed there for another week, and I could only see her after her dad left. So again hiding me. I didn't think much of it and let it slide cause I would just be too nosy.

We didn't hang out that much in September and this month now, cause she is is busy with her master year, which is asking a lot from her.

Two weeks ago we went on a date, things felt off. And it made me frustrated that we weren't as close as before, I jokingly said I would need a new girlfriend after some stupid thing we were joking about. She laughed and said it would be ok we would be going for coffee. So the day after I texted that I felt she was waiting for me to break up with her cause I felt nothing more than a friend. I felt unloved. And she didn't have the balls to do it herself. The thing she said bugged me hard and rubbed me the wrong way. I said if you wanna make this work then I need more time from you, I was hardly seeing her. Like if you care you would find more time right?

She said she cares for me a lot but she needs time and space, that we go in circles cause I ask more, she can't give more, we talk, I ask more. It's taking half of her mind, and she can't do that cause she needs to focus on her priorities which are her studies. She doesn't want me to wait for her and feels we are living two different realities. She thinks I think she's the woman I want for the rest of my life, and said she's not.

She doesn't want me to change but she said she needs a bit of distance cause our lifestyles are not compatible right now.

So all this time I felt like she just used me to fill that lonely void of being alone in a city, not wanting anything serious but never really fucking telling me straight to my face, always just stringing me along. Just somebody to keep her warm at night and give her validation. Feels good right? So never really giving the guy back what he deserved.

The keywords here are give her time and space, incompatible lifestyles¬†**right now**. She never mentioned the words breaking up. She would love to go for coffee in a few months but thinks it's a bad idea right now.

So.. I don't want to wait but I also don't want to move further. I was happy with her, and I know if she ends her studies she could give this a lot more energy. She never really fought for this, just let it happen, giving in to the situation which can't be changed. Why let a person go like this this easy? I could find another woman sure, doesn't bother her apparently.

She knows I would be an amazing partner, I gave her my best while putting myself first a lot.

Will she come back or am I a fool that got used?

Either way I'm disappearing from her life, no contact.

Mind you I'm focusing on myself, talking to different people (women)",0,1728985014.0,heartbreak,0,0.5,False
1g43rqy,https://i.redd.it/57a1amaz3wud1.png,20 Years of Anand Movie,"If there's one movie I love wholeheartedly from TFI it's Anand Movie. This is a classic and a quintessential Tollywood movie. It was released exactly today, 20 years ago. 

The movie is like a warm cup of coffee on a beautiful monsoon morning. It has an insane re-watch value. Starting with the set design, costumes, cinematography, music, props, the dialogues, every single thing about the movie elevates the beautiful story it tells. 

The movie feels like a love letter to young Telugu women, crafted with utmost respect, dignity and affection. 

The characters of Roopa and Anand are very well written. Roopa, her trauma, her relationships and friendship dynamics, her strength, her mindset was portrayed very well by Kamalini Mukherjee. Raja was wonderful in bringing the gentle and earnest Anand to life. Can't imagine anyone else in these roles although Anand's role was apparently written with Pawan Kalyan in mind. 

Anand's music album is one that never tires you, KM Radha Krishnan has cemented the movie as a classic with his compositions. 

The lyrics penned by Veturi have breathed life into the movie. Every single line is so beautiful that it brings tears to my eyes. 

Satya Krishnan, Anish Kuruvilla, Anuj Guruwara, Chandana Chakrabarti, Bakhitha, Snoopy gaadu, Bhow Bhow Gaadu, uff, the movie wouldn't be the same without this wonderful cast. 

Inka raayali ante oka 20 pages rastha. Antha picchi ga istam naaku ee movie. 

There's a directors cut of this movie on YouTube with some extra scenes. That shows a bit more of Roopa falling in love with Anand. Do check it out of you have time. It's totally worth it.

I'm really sad that there's no re-release of this movie today, but I hope it can be done sometime in future. I'll bring at least 20 people to the theater lol.

1g43qvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g43qvw/i_cut_off_my_chosen_sister_after_i_kicked_her_out/,I cut off my chosen sister after I kicked her out of my place ,"Okay, so some background, I (25 F)have been really close with this person (26 F) for years, they were there for a big surgery I had to get that made it hard for me to move around for a while, I‚Äôve been there for them when they attempted s*****e and regularly made sure to call in with them while they were in a mental hospital, even was there for them when they cheated on another close friend of mine when they were manic, which I don‚Äôt use as an excuse and hold her accountable with her actions, and even have been there to comfort her when she‚Äôs called me about her mom who is terrible and extremely abusive. But whenever it came to her needs, if I didn‚Äôt meet them in her preferred way or expected timeframe, she would always call me the most vile , talk down my relationship with my fianc√©e (23 F), tell me I deserved to be alone and then she would also hang over my head ‚Äúhow much she‚Äôs done for me‚Äù when all the things she has done for me was completely voluntary, she chose to step up and do them for me even when I didn‚Äôt ask. This has been a constant cycle for years. Come this trip that just recently ended where she was here for two weeks from Texas with her mom (where we originally planned for her to be here for the entire two weeks at our place, but her mom paid for her flight ticket and told her since she paid for it she was going to come with her for the first week). With her moms track record I knew a week wasn‚Äôt going to last with them, I warned my friend that I was worried her mom was going to throw off everything and cause a huge problem and said I expected that if she stayed with her mom for the trip for the first week that I would probably see her only a few days in because her mom would do something to make her not want to finish the week with her. I was right. On the exact day I expected something to happen it did. I‚Äôm not going to go into detail of all that happened but let‚Äôs just say my friend called me that evening saying she was stranded at an airport in the middle of Virginia alongside her niece and had no way to get anywhere. So I told her I wouldn‚Äôt have minded coming to pick her up I was mostly worried about my phone bill which was disconnected until I could pay it a handful of days from then because of the timing of my checks, she offered to pay them and said I can pay her back whenever or not she didn‚Äôt care. I said okay and took the offer and made the plan to go get her with my fianc√©e. We got back home with her and settled in our place at 3 in the morning and I went to work immediately after we got home because I work at 4 in the morning at my job. I got home afterwards and brought donuts for everyone for breakfast and other snacks I knew my friend loved as I planned to give her a good day to clear her head and rest and spend time with me as we hadn‚Äôt since she left for home again last year around this time after staying for my surgery. I got home and all of her things were spread about my place lazily and she and her niece were missing, I texted her where she was and she told me she went to hang out with a friend she wanted to meet while she was in town. I was a little annoyed as we had already talked about what me and her had planned and that I was going to get off at 12 that day to start the day with her early and we would hang out and stuff. Apparently she ‚Äúforgot‚Äù and said she wouldn‚Äôt be out much longer and eventually after like 30 minutes said she was heading home in a minute, that became almost 3 hours to where I just gave up hanging out with her mostly that day and just got some rest since i hadn‚Äôt for almost 36 hours at that point and pretty much slept the rest of the day. The next day I was off and me and my fiancee both were off, we were both unsure what was planned but she had already beaten us to the punch by us walking out into the living room and finding her getting ready for something already and THEN tells us that we were all going to Starbucks to get coffee with her sister-in-law and we had about 20 minutes to get ready. Me and my fianc√©e were a little annoyed as we have already pre warned her that we needed an actual plan of what she wanted to do during the trip and the timeline of those plans so we knew what to expect and do which is really important for my fianc√©e as she has high functioning autism and not knowing what‚Äôs going on and stuff for her with plans and stuff is a lot for her to handle. We decided to get ready and go as she said they would be mobile ordering and we wouldn‚Äôt even really have to do much but just ride with them. We said okay and hopped in the car with her sister-in-law where the very first thing she says to us is ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs two black gay guys in a couple and they have a baby, who‚Äôs the one to leave?‚Äù I never really heard a joke like that from her and was really surprised and uncomfortable immediately and my fianc√©e was really not vibing with that and I could tell she instantly regretted getting in the car. She never mobile ordered or asked us what we wanted and by the time me and my fiancee realized, we were in the drive thru and my friend looked back at us after not even really saying we needed a minute to order and me and my fianc√©e rarely have gotten anything from Starbucks so we were expecting the mobile order plans to help us figure out what we wanted where we could take our time to figure it out. That wasn‚Äôt the case, so out of pressure of time my fianc√©e just gave up and said she didn‚Äôt want anything which frustrated me a bit with my friend because she was going to work not too long after that and now she won‚Äôt be eating anything all morning. I just found something simple that sounded okay and ordered that and we headed home but during the entire car ride my friends sister-in-law is driving with TikTok open on her phone actively scrolling which terrified me and my fianc√©e that we‚Äôd get in an accident. When we got home my fianc√©e went to get ready for work while shaking off how overwhelming a simple trip to Starbucks was. I told my friend how I was a little annoyed that nothing has gone to plan since she‚Äôs been here and that we thought there was some form of it. She said she was waiting to plan things with me to where I explained how it‚Äôs been hard to so far given it‚Äôs been one sudden and unplanned thing after another already and that we had already thought up ideas before she even came into town but she never fleshed anything out with anyone and just said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking it day by day‚Äù which instantly frustrated me because that‚Äôs the opposite of planning. I brushed it off and we just kind of relaxed for the rest of the day after we finally fleshed out at least the next day of the trip but she ended up falling asleep not too long after that so the rest of the trip was still unplanned. The next day goes a bit smoother though I was pretty overwhelmed with all that we were doing between me driving to drop off my fianc√©e at work after I finished work myself and showing my friend how to DoorDash as she was curious about it since she doesn‚Äôt have a job and needed to find something simple with income, me driving to pick up her other nieces for a little girls night she planned, and me getting my eyebrow pierced finally. It was a decent day where I was pretty tired after. Come the next day and me and my fianc√©e are both pretty tired after all of that as we kind of had to squeeze rest in throughout the trip so far which took a toll on us and everyone besides my friend and her family saw it, my friend tells us about the dinner with one of her online friends that was pretty much the only thing we actually had expected this entire trip and when she wanted to do it that day. We apologize and tell her that we both have been extremely exhausted and we were going to stay home and get some more proper rest and offered to let her take the car so she could still go see her friend as we didn‚Äôt want us hanging back to ruin her plans as she didn‚Äôt have any other method of transportation. She says she‚Äôs okay with that and goes to meet this person. Suddenly at midnight she texts my fianc√©e that she brought over another friend she met during the night to stay the night with her alongside her niece which is something we never talked about or expected. She confessed that she didn‚Äôt ask them what time they got off of work (which was late) and still wanted to try and hang out with them. Which I later found out the person who was invited had already told her she felt uncomfortable doing something like that to us so last minute and my friend said ‚Äúthey‚Äôll be okay with it‚Äù which we definitely weren‚Äôt because neither of us knew this person at the time. I didn‚Äôt even fully know about it until I came home from work for my lunch break the next morning and had to find out by pretty much seeing them hanging out and smoking with my friend in the guest room after I was going in the room originally to show my friend that I got some eggnog for later that day for us to enjoy. I was floored to find out what was going on and was a bit upset but tried to just push it down for the sake of not making her feel bad we were uncomfortable and upset with the situation at hand because now we had two people in our house that we never accounted for and now had to figure out their transportation and stuff later that day and she‚Äôs already seen how her unplanned things have frustrated us and made us tired already but has done nothing substantial to make anything better since. But then not too long after me finding that out my friend gets some eggnog and starts offering it to everyone which just blew me away because I just bought that eggnog and originally planned for it to be for just me and her and my fianc√©e. I told her that and she got upset and said she bought groceries for everyone a few days ago and I shouldn‚Äôt be annoyed she‚Äôs sharing my eggnog because she shared her groceries (which wasn‚Äôt fully true because those groceries were stuff for her like face wash and toothpaste and stuff and some food for her girls night with her nieces so there wasn‚Äôt really anything substantial to really say that kind of thing). I explain that I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with them even being in my house without knowing much about it at all besides her last minute texting my fianc√©e what was going on AS SHE WAS COMING HOME WITH THEM. As I‚Äôm try to explain she starts yelling and calling us assholes for being upset and dumbasses and retarded which instantly set me off and yelled and told her she needed to leave as she‚Äôs disrespected me and my fianc√©e enough and she said ‚ÄúI will once I finish washing your dishes‚Äù which I told her I didn‚Äôt care about those and she didn‚Äôt bother cleaning anything the entire trip so why do it now and to just leave to which she started yelling even more and then broke a bunch of dishes. I instantly said she needed to go immediately and told her to stop touching my dishes and to just leave to where it became us both yelling which eventually broke my fianc√©e and she snapped and said ‚Äúget out you stupid bitch I can‚Äôt take this anymore‚Äù and I knew she was overwhelmed to the extreme for her to even snap like that and I made her go into our bedroom while I called 911 because at that point the entire house was getting out of control and I still had to go back to work in 30 minutes. The cops were on the way and I told her she needed to gather her things and during the entire phone call with police she‚Äôs calling us even more vile stuff and then went completely homophobic and a bunch of other things. Finally the cops arrive as she‚Äôs trying to walk out the door and they help diffuse everything and get her sorted out with a ride from our place with her friends and they leave. Not too long after that she sent a message to my fianc√©e as I had already blocked her and continued saying vile disrespectful stuff to her and said she hoped we rotted and ended up completely alone. Then come the past couple of days where I‚Äôve been dealing with a couple of her friends sending me or my fianc√©e messages about how we were lying about the story because she told them she ‚Äúonly broke one dish‚Äù or ‚Äúthey were cheap‚Äù to her friend that was there who saw all of it happen and told her she shouldn‚Äôt have broken dishes like that. Eventually once I posted about the full story on my socials to get things clear they then were upset at me because ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have called the cops and kicked her out‚Äù. Her friend that was there later that day apologized about how everything could have been avoided to begin with if she actually asked if we were okay with what my friend was doing but also said it was really messed up for her to behave the way she did. Then I find out my friend has been posting about me with her side of the story and god knows what narrative shes spinning because I already figured out she‚Äôs lied to two people, but I don‚Äôt even really want to look or anything because I just want to grieve about it all and move on.

Eighteen Months earlier

  
¬†

The cold blue glow of his computer screen cast eerie shadows on the walls of Ryan‚Äôs office. It was late, and the building was almost empty. In the past weeks, he had been feeling increasingly uneasy, a gnawing sense of dread that he couldn‚Äôt quite place. Integrating the NanoChip software and working on the AI controls systems had become a monumental task, and the constant scrutiny from the board, particularly from their CEO, Edmundsson, made it all the more unbearable.

The pressure was immense. The NanoChip was supposed to be NAPPA‚Äôs crowning achievement, a revolutionary piece of technology that could change the world. But as the head of software and AI integration, Ryan felt the weight of that responsibility pressing down on him every day. He was beginning to crack under the strain.

He knew they had to get this launch right. They wouldn‚Äôt have a second chance. But Edmundsson wasn‚Äôt just increasing pressure on everyone, but he was slowing them down due to his safety concerns. Ryan knew it was bullshit. He was concerned about one thing only‚Äîcash. Always had been. What triggered him, though, was one particular email by Edmundsson, in which he had even started talking about postponing the launch, citing concerns that the AI integration had not been tested enough. This could cause a delay of weeks, even months! Ryan couldn‚Äôt let that happen. This was *his* life‚Äôs work, too!

Unable to bear the pressure any longer, that evening, Ryan stormed into General Meyer‚Äôs office, passing Dr. Zhang with whom she had apparently just met with. He found Meyer reviewing reports on her computer, her expression focused and intense. An obligatory large bottle of coke and a cup of coffee were her newest companions. Apparently, she was feeling the pressure, as well.

‚ÄúGeneral, we need to talk,‚Äù Ryan said, his voice trembling with frustration.

Meyer looked up from her coffee, slightly surprised by his abrupt entrance. Several empty cups were loosely spread on her table. ‚ÄúRyan, how can I help you?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Edmundsson. He‚Äôs constantly questioning the NanoChip project, raising concerns about timelines, AI integrations, and customer feedback. Everything has to be tested, then retested twice. He‚Äôs using every excuse in the book, and it‚Äôs slowing us down,‚Äù Ryan explained, pacing the room.

Meyer leaned back in her chair, considering his words. ‚ÄúEdmundsson is a cautious man at his core, especially when it comes to finances. If something is jeopardizing the sales of NanoChip, he‚Äôs bound to respond. So, he‚Äôs trying to avoid any public backlash by being careful.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut we can‚Äôt afford to take breaks,‚Äù Ryan insisted. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on the brink of something extraordinary, and his hesitation is risking everything.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you suggest?‚Äù She sipped her coffee.

‚ÄúWe complete the AI integration still in version Beta. Once the product is launched, we deal with smaller issues. We know the NanoChip is safe enough. This is what I‚Äôve been telling the team for months now. There is no complete security in a project like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean by that?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I told this to both Edmundsson and Amanda many times before. Yes, the user will be the last authority, but the system is not perfect, the AI is not perfect. There are always ways to circumvent the AI and interfere with the NanoChips. In the end, the nanobots have to communicate with each other, and we can disturb that process.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù Meyer looked surprised. ‚ÄúI had no idea.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, you would need significant resources and time to do that, but no system is perfect is what I‚Äôm saying.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an interesting point you‚Äôre raising. I do agree with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnyway, coming back to the topic at hand‚ÄîEdmundsson; what do we do about him?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWell, what does Niko say about it?‚Äù Meyer took a few notes and started to scribble on a block of paper. She was really old-school like that.

‚ÄúNiko is engrossed in his work with the medical and regulatory department. They are preparing for launch, so I barely get to see him anymore, except at board meetings and press conferences. You know him, he wouldn‚Äôt understand me. But you understand, don‚Äôt you, General?‚Äù

Meyer looked up, studied him for a moment, then nodded. ‚ÄúI see that you have a lot of potential, Ryan. You‚Äôre still young, but if you want to progress in your career and if you want to be a leader at NAPPA, you need to deal with the likes of Edmundsson. Show him that we need to move forward, for the sake of our vision.‚Äù

Ryan felt a mix of relief and anxiety. ‚ÄúWhat are you suggesting?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm suggesting you take control of the situation and confront him,‚Äù Meyer said firmly. ‚ÄúSometimes, leadership means making hard decisions. Now, I would ask you to please leave. I have another meeting coming up in a minute and have to prepare.‚Äù¬†

Ryan turned around to leave.

‚ÄúOh, and Ryan? One more thing‚Äîdo speak with Amanda. She has made some remarkable progress in the NanoChip functions recently. You might be able to help her with some integration aspects. Maybe also tell my secretary to bring me another one of these? With lots of sugar?‚Äù She pointed to her empty mug.

Ryan left her office, agitated. Was Edmundsson an obstacle to his success and to NAPPA‚Äôs vision? Did General Meyer really see it, too? He felt a surge of adrenalin passing through him.

Days turned into weeks, and Ryan‚Äôs paranoia grew. He started to see Edmundsson as a threat to his career and to NAPPA‚Äôs future. Their interactions became increasingly tense, their conversations filled with veiled threats and accusations.

Then Ryan found himself standing outside Edmundsson‚Äôs office. He was in such a state that he didn‚Äôt even realize how he had gotten there or why.¬†

The door was slightly ajar, and he could hear Edmundsson talking on the phone, his voice filled with concern.

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt allow them to go through with this. It‚Äôs too dangerous.‚Äù

Ryan listened, contemplating what to say to him when, suddenly, his vision blurred with rage. He pushed the door open, stepping inside. ‚ÄúThomas, we need to talk.‚Äù

Edmundsson looked up, startled. ‚ÄúRyan, what are you doing here?‚Äù

Ryan had a menacing, scary look in his eyes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a threat to NAPPA‚Äôs future. You‚Äôre standing in the way. I can‚Äôt let you endanger what we have built.‚Äù Ryan‚Äôs hand trembled as he reached into his pocket, feeling the cool metal of a small device. He took it out and turned it on.



Edmundsson, who was currently standing up from his desk, froze in place.

Ryan approached him. ‚ÄúYou see, Thomas, this is a little something I have been working on in the last few weeks. All those late nights in the office weren‚Äôt for nothing.‚Äù He grimaced. ‚ÄúIt sends a signal to your NanoChip and depletes your neurotransmitter GABA. It basically mimics the stiff person syndrome. Meaning, you can‚Äôt move unless I let you. Pretty cool, huh?‚Äù

Edmundsson‚Äôs eyes widened. He was able to whisper, ‚ÄúRyan, you don‚Äôt have to do this. We can find another way.‚Äù

Ryan‚Äôs mind was a storm of conflicting thoughts, his paranoia reaching a breaking point. ‚ÄúNo, this is the only way,‚Äù he convinced himself. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm surprised you can still speak. It seems this device still needs some work. I‚Äôm pretty sure we can improve it in the future.‚Äù He laughed.

‚ÄúRyan‚Ä¶ why?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot only are you slowing the company down but, as I found out today, you‚Äôre also a traitor. I know you‚Äôve been dealing with the Chinese. What do you think would happen if this came out? We are an international company, Thomas‚Äîthe US backed us from the start. You‚Äôre endangering our future, don‚Äôt you see? We can‚Äôt afford to pick sides in this war.‚Äù Ryan looked at him, full of disgust. ‚ÄúAnd how stupid of you to leave evidence about your military lab on the desk after last night‚Äôs meeting? You‚Äôre getting old. You don‚Äôt deserve to be my CEO. You even don‚Äôt deserve to live!‚Äù

He took out a prepared syringe from his other pocket, put it in Edmundsson‚Äôs hand, and slowly injected the needle in the other arm‚Äîa combination of high dose insulin and beta blockers, cheap and effective. Soon, he would enter severe hypoglycemia, and his heart would slow down massively.¬†

*This is a kind, painless death*, Ryan thought. *After all, I‚Äôm not a monster.*

Tears rolled from Edmundsson‚Äôs eyes as he thought about his wife.

As Edmundsson‚Äôs lifeless body slumped over the table, Ryan staggered back, the reality of what he had done crashing down on him. Ryan‚Äôs legs gave way, and he collapsed to the floor.

Several minutes later, the door opened. Amanda Zhang stepped in, looking at her computer, apparently coming to a scheduled meeting. ‚ÄúWhat is happening here?‚Äù¬† was followed by a scream after seeing Edmundsson‚Äôs lifeless body. ‚ÄúWhat happened, Ryan? What‚Äôs wrong with Thomas?‚Äù

Ryan slowly stood up. ‚ÄúI just found him a second ago, with a syringe in his hand. He‚Äôs dead, I think. I can‚Äôt believe he could do something like this,‚Äù Ryan lied.

‚ÄúOh my goodness, quickly, call an ambulance‚Äîcall someone!‚Äù she shouted.

Soon enough, a small group of people gathered around the office, all whispering in shock and disbelief.

General Meyer was pacing around and checking her phone. ‚ÄúQuickly, quickly,‚Äù she was saying to herself, as if confused. Then, looking at Ryan‚Äôs lost gaze while he sat by himself in the corridor, she felt pity. ‚ÄúYou poor soul, how hard this must be on you.‚Äù She took Ryan‚Äôs hand, pulled him close, and gave him a hug.

In that moment, Ryan felt like a huge weight had been lifted from his shoulders. He felt‚Ä¶ happy.

¬†

Thomas Edmundsson had been a soldier for the Western Front during ‚ÄúThe Third War.‚Äù It seemed useless to call it a ‚ÄúThird World War‚Äù anymore‚Äîwho else would it involve if not the whole world? The idea of another option seemed ridiculous. Like most of his generation, he had seen horrors that no one should ever witness‚Äîcities reduced to rubble, comrades falling beside him, and the grotesque aftermath of chemical warfare on both enemies and allies. Although he had managed to rise to the rank of major due to his sharp mind and keen sense for strategy, these experiences had hardened his heart and scarred him forever. If he had learned one thing, though it was to look out for yourself first, then everyone else. Ruthlessness should be your second nature, a survival mechanism honed on the battlefield.

Until he had met his kind, loving wife, that was. But that came with burdens of its own.¬†

Brit was from a wealthy family and used to having nice things, while his in-laws never really accepted him as their equal due to his modest upbringing.

After the war, Edmundsson sought refuge in his scientific pursuits, hoping to leave behind the brutal past. He had found immense success in that field, but he couldn‚Äôt quite escape the past. He couldn‚Äôt sleep, his PTSD keeping him captive.¬† He became prone to outside influences, trying to impress people he shouldn‚Äôt have cared about. Plus, an evolving gambling addiction had dragged him slowly into a financial abyss. Debts mounted as he lost one asset after another, his money and inheritance all spent. No bank in the US wanted to lend him money anymore, having seen his poor financial decisions.¬†

In desperation, he turned to other opportunities two years to join NAPPA, in order to continue his and his wife‚Äôs lavish lifestyle. It seemed, to him, that his inner demons threatened to unravel everything he had built, making him increasingly desperate to protect his fragile world. However, as soon as he had joined NAPPA, things finally started looking up.

Late in the evening, Edmundsson sat in his new NAPPA office in Singapore, with a big, fat ‚ÄúCEO‚Äù sign on the office door, newly brought that morning. He was surrounded by papers, scientific journals, and stacks of data. A picture of his wife sat on his desk.

His mind was far from the intricate details of nanotechnology as he waited for his last meeting of the day when a tall man he didn‚Äôt recognize unexpectedly entered his office. Although he wore a face mask, his gaze was piercing, made even more intense by his wide, googly eyes.

Before Edmundsson could say a word, the man began to speak through the mask. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter? You look like you‚Äôve seen a ghost, Professor Edmundsson.‚Äù His voice was cold and menacing. ‚ÄúLet me cut straight to the chase: I know who you are and what you owe.‚Äù

Edmundsson‚Äôs heart pounded. ‚ÄúWho are you? What do you want?‚Äù

‚ÄúDespite what you might think, I am here to help you. You can call me your *friend*. And believe me; you want me to stay your friend. I am currently acting as an intermediary for the Bank of Shanghai, and I can help you prevent further escalation.‚Äù

Edmundsson shifted nervously from one leg to another but didn‚Äôt say anything.

‚ÄúWe heard about your new company, Professor,‚Äù the man continued. ‚ÄúA very interesting product you have here. Did you think they forgot about you? It‚Äôs a shame your company has only deals with the Western Bloc right now. Doesn‚Äôt that seem a bit‚Ä¶ unfair? Why shouldn‚Äôt the rest of the world profit from this technology? To rectify this misunderstanding, they have a proposal for you: you will give them your knowledge about this company and its technology. If needed, you will conduct experiments for them.¬†

‚ÄúNo, no, stay seated, Professor, I am not quite finished.

‚ÄúIf you refuse to comply, we can easily expose your ties to the Chinese government and ruin your career. But this path doesn‚Äôt help either side. And if that argument doesn‚Äôt sway you, I will make sure to pay a visit to Brit.‚Äù

Edmundsson finally mustered the strength to speak. ‚ÄúLeave my wife out of this, you bastard.‚Äù

‚ÄúBastard or not, you have one day to think about it. If, for any reason, you think of talking to someone, Brit will pay the price. If you don‚Äôt deliver on your promise, she will pay the price. Don‚Äôt. Fuck. Me. Over.‚Äù

Edmundsson was panicking; he felt his chest constrict.

‚ÄúSpeaking of price,‚Äù the man continued relentlessly, ‚Äúmake sure you also repay the debt you owe, with interest. We will be in touch. I sent my contact to your phone. Goodbye now.‚Äù He left Edmundsson gasping for breath and his mind delirious, looking for solutions.

Obviously, he wouldn‚Äôt be able to straight-out give them all of NAPPA‚Äôs documents without getting caught, so he devised a plan, in a second. He needed to buy time by ensuring that the technology he delivered to the Chinese was incomplete and flawed. It must appear functional, but it should never fully work. Until then, he would make sure Brit was safe. He had his connections, of course. If he had to take on more debt, he would. If he had to use company funds, he would. Anything to keep her safe.  


Edmundsson slumped back into his chair, clutching the picture of his wife, tears streaming down his face.

1g43joi,https://www.reddit.com/r/gynecomastia/comments/1g43joi/post_surgery_tips_thread/,Post Surgery Tips Thread,"I posted this as a comment on another thread, but thought it might deserve its own post.
I‚Äôm 4 days out of surgery with Dr Nurein. 
So far it‚Äôs been as good of an experience as it probably could have been (touch wood).

I‚Äôm pretty fresh out of surgery (day 4) and have been pleased with the results so far. Haven‚Äôt had any complications (yet! touch wood). Here‚Äôs some things I‚Äôve found that have helped:

I‚Äôve been told to avoid supplements for a week before surgery (fish oil etc) by my surgeon because this can affect how blood clots form and may have other side effects that just aren‚Äôt worth the risk

The day before surgery and the day of surgery avoid spicy food! Last thing you need is an upset stomach on the day of surgery.

Avoid caffeine on the day of surgery, prevents jitters and interactions with stress and anaesthetic.

I got into pretty good shape in the weeks leading up to surgery. I did this because I knew I was going to miss working out during recovery and also wanted to make sure my body was fit to be worked on.

Eat in a slight surplus as you recover - I‚Äôve been pretty ravenous this past week. I am normally good at consuming calories that I intuitively sense my body needs. I‚Äôve been eating good quality protein (from foods and whey protein supplements) post surgery. I haven‚Äôt started taking any other supplements yet, but may start vitamin D and C soon.

I wouldn‚Äôt really worry about water consumption in my opinion, just don‚Äôt be silly with it. I‚Äôve been drinking a lot of water and coffee since the surgery and have had no issues so far.

Sleep well! I‚Äôve been ensuring that I go to bed a bit earlier to offset the fact it may take me longer to get to sleep. I‚Äôve felt great for it and think I‚Äôve recovered well as a result of it (so far).

I‚Äôd avoid driving for two days if you can (the surgeon probably will have their on recommendation), I drove on the second day and I felt sore from it.

Get button up shirts + vests + tops easy to put on.

I‚Äôm a side sleeper but I quickly got used to sleeping on my back (although apparently it makes me snore lol).

I‚Äôve had a 4 day break from work (including day of surgery). I had the surgery on the Friday, then I had Saturday and Sunday and then I also had Monday off work. I wfh and I felt this was enough time for me to recover (I did have quite a minor case though).

I have been walking about but making sure I pay attention to my body. I did about 10,000 steps on the Sunday (Day 2) of surgery when I went for a walk with my partner, but felt pretty achey after. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing that much but getting some steps in every day isn‚Äôt a bad idea. Again this definitely depends on your case.

Finally make sure you have someone to keep you company! My partner has been great in helping me around the house/get changed/reapplying compression top/showering/preparing food. I‚Äôm sure a parent/close friend/housemate could assist if you need it but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend trying to solo it unless you have to.

I begged and pleaded for long but not like too much, every day or 1-3 days I would send her something. However, we had closure face to face we went on coffee maybe month and half after she broke it off via text and she acted little nervous and annoyed and started to complain about how she had rough day at work etc. On that coffee she just started to bombard me with all negative things about me and what she didnt like in our relationship. She also said some things that are silly and she never said it before like ,,that I am too much house type of person and I dont like travelling"" thats funny because she also doesnt have other close friends to travel with and in last 3 years we travelled everywhere together. 
Anyways after that meeting I saw in her eyes some sadness and she told me if you need anything you can always contact me, and we hugged in the end. 
One week after that I accidently bumbed on her on streets and she didnt even say hello she just passed by me with angry face. 
Also through our texting before that she always just lashed out on me like I cheated her or kill her whole family. I didnt say nothing hurtfull to her before breakup. She just said that I hurted her many times in relationship. I understand that part but I cant understand then why she acted like everything is fine before breaking up and called me on dates etc...?

From classic to contemporary interiors, [ceramic vases](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration/vases/ceramic-vases) are a versatile design element that can instantly elevate a room‚Äôs aesthetic. Whether used as a centerpiece on a dining table or as a subtle accent on a shelf, their timeless elegance makes them a must-have in every home. In this blog, we‚Äôll explore why ceramic vases continue to be a popular decor choice and how they compare to other materials, such as [glass vases](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration/vases/glass-vases), when it comes to enhancing your home.

**The Timeless Appeal of Ceramic Vases**

Ceramic vases have been used for centuries in homes across the globe. What makes them so special is their ability to complement a wide variety of design styles, from minimalist and modern to rustic and traditional. Their durability, combined with a handcrafted aesthetic, adds both beauty and texture to a space.

Here are a few reasons why ceramic vases should be a staple in your home decor:

**1. Versatility in Design**

Ceramic vases come in a wide range of shapes, sizes, and colors, making them a versatile option for any room. Whether you‚Äôre styling a minimalist living room with neutral tones or adding charm to a boho-chic bedroom, ceramic vases can easily be integrated into your design scheme.

A [white ceramic vases](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/white-ceramic-vase) is especially timeless and can fit into any decor style. Its neutral color offers a clean, sophisticated look, whether placed on a coffee table, mantel, or console.

You can also experiment with bold, textured ceramic pieces to create a statement or introduce earthy tones like terracotta for a more natural, organic vibe.

**2. Enduring Craftsmanship**

Ceramic vases are often handcrafted, which gives them an artisanal quality that‚Äôs hard to replicate with mass-produced materials. The intricate detailing, glazing techniques, and unique finishes make each ceramic vase feel like a piece of art. This craftsmanship gives your home a touch of authenticity, whether you opt for a large floor vase or a small decorative vase.

**3. A Centerpiece for Every Room**

Ceramic vases are the perfect accessory for any room in the house. In the living room, they can act as a centerpiece on the coffee table or as an accent on open shelving. In the dining room, a white ceramic vase filled with fresh flowers can create a stunning tablescape. In the bedroom, placing a vase on a dresser or nightstand adds softness and elegance to the space.

Additionally, ceramic vases are not just decorative; they‚Äôre functional too. Use them to hold fresh or dried flowers, or let them stand alone as sculptural pieces.

**Why Choose Ceramic Vases Over Other Materials?**

While ceramic vases bring a timeless elegance, they‚Äôre not the only option for home decor. \*\*Glass vases\*\* are another popular choice for homeowners looking to add style and sophistication to their space. But how do ceramic vases stack up against glass?

**1. Durability**

One of the key advantages of ceramic vases over glass vases is durability. Ceramic is a sturdy material that can withstand daily wear and tear, making it ideal for busy households or homes with children and pets. Glass, while beautiful, is more fragile and prone to breaking, which can be a concern for those who prioritize practicality in their decor choices.

**2. Aesthetic Variety**

While glass vases offer a sleek, modern look, ceramic vases provide more variety in terms of texture and design. Glass vases tend to be more transparent and minimalist, whereas ceramic pieces come in a wider array of finishes, from matte to glossy, and offer more opportunities to introduce texture and color into your decor.

For a more minimalist aesthetic, white ceramic vases are an excellent choice, offering a clean, elegant look that‚Äôs both simple and sophisticated. They can serve as a neutral backdrop for colorful blooms or stand alone as a statement piece.

For a pop of color or texture, a glazed ceramic vase can introduce depth and contrast to your decor, something that glass often lacks.

**3. Warmth and Character**

While glass vases exude modern elegance, ceramic vases bring warmth and character to a space. The natural imperfections and handmade quality of ceramic pieces offer a sense of authenticity and history, giving your home a more inviting and lived-in feel.

**Decorating with Ceramic Vases**

Now that we‚Äôve explored the advantages of ceramic vases, here are some tips on how to style them in your home:

**1. Create a Focal Point**

A large white ceramic vase can act as a focal point in any room. Whether you place it in the center of your dining table or on a mantel, its neutral tone will draw attention without overpowering the space. Fill it with seasonal flowers, branches, or dried pampas grass for a fresh and modern look.

**2. Group Vases Together**

For a more dramatic effect, group different-sized vases together. Combining ceramic vases with glass vases can add visual interest to your decor. Try mixing a matte ceramic vase with a sleek, transparent glass vase to create contrast and depth on a console table or shelf.

**3. Mix with Other Materials**

To add even more texture to your space, consider pairing your ceramic vases with other materials like wood, metal, or rattan. A ceramic vase placed on a wooden sideboard or next to metal candle holders creates a balanced and dynamic decor scheme.

**Final Thoughts**

Ceramic vases are a timeless and elegant addition to any home decor. Their versatility, durability, and aesthetic appeal make them a must-have for anyone looking to add a touch of sophistication to their space. Whether you choose a white ceramic vase for its simplicity or pair it with glass vases for added texture, ceramic vases can transform any room into a stylish and welcoming environment.",1,1728982960.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

1g43ayg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1g43ayg/fearful_avoidant_discard/,Fearful Avoidant Discard,"So, I‚Äôve **(29M)** had a pretty strange experience lately, and I‚Äôm still processing it. Everything between me and this girl **(23F)** I was seeing seemed to be going well. We clicked and had a lot of fun together. But the way it ended left me confused and frustrated.

She has a fearful-avoidant (FA) attachment style, which I hadn‚Äôt dealt with before. Basically, she ended things not because of any specific issues between us, but because she was worried I‚Äôd leave her eventually. She wanted to protect herself from potential hurt. It felt strange because we really had a good connection, and it seemed like the breakup came out of nowhere.

She had mentioned that she‚Äôs been in therapy for her attachment sty;e and told her therapist she wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I ended things because she felt undeserving. She even said she thought ""I had a secure attachment style, which I‚Äôve worked on for years.""

A day before the breakup, she seemed worried I was mad at her, so we had a video chat to clear things up. Everything felt fine afterward, but the next day, we met for coffee, and she ended it. She said things were moving too fast and mentioned vague concerns about the future. Her reasons didn‚Äôt really add up, but once she made up her mind, I didn‚Äôt push. I hugged her, wished her the best, and walked away.

I really liked her, and we always had a good time together, so the breakup was frustrating. If there were real compatibility issues, I‚Äôd understand. But this seemed entirely driven by her emotional fears.

After reflecting for a couple of days, I sent her a message:

>*""Hey, I hope you're doing well. I‚Äôve taken some time to reflect on everything, and I think we were amazing together. The time we spent and the memories we made mean a lot to me, and I truly thought we could have an incredible future together.*

>*I‚Äôm willing to work on things with you, but I understand that you‚Äôve made your decision to end it. While I might feel differently, I respect your choice and intend to move forward with my life. I genuinely wish you all the best in whatever comes next. üòä‚Äù""*

She responded with:

>""Hey I'm doing ok thanks..Thank you for messaging - I've been wanting to message all weekend, but I wanted to give you some space. I've also spent some time thinking about things since Friday and if I'm being honest I've been feeling quite sad about the situation. I had a great time getting to know you and I won't forget the great memories we made together. Thank you for treating me with nothing but respect and kindness. You're such a genuine, thoughtful person which makes ending things so much harder. I have been very conflicted with how I feel about things, but ultimately I believe I have made the right decision. I also want to apologise for not communicating better throughout our time together and not making my reasons for ending things clearer. I hope that this isn't goodbye and I would like to stay in contact..but I understand if you don't. I wish you all the best ‚ù§Ô∏è""

At that point, I agreed to stay in contact, hoping things might still work out. I even invited her to join my friend group on WhatsApp, and she did. A few days later, I asked if she wanted to grab coffee, and she agreed immediately. Two days before our coffee date, I bumped into her at a coffee shop. We had a quick chat, and everything seemed normal.

When we finally met for coffee, I was friendly and respected her boundaries. We had planned to go to karaoke on our last date before the breakup, so we decided to go. We ended up singing some romantic songs, and while walking her back to the tram, we kissed. She was really into it, but afterward, she said she needed to think. I sent her a message later that day:

>""I had a great time with you today. It might‚Äôve started slow, but it ended up being a lot of fun. It felt so good to reconnect, and it reminded me how much I enjoy spending time with you. There‚Äôs no pressure or rush on my side‚ÄîI‚Äôm happy to take things at whatever pace feels right for you. I just want to enjoy our time together and see where things go. Also, you can call or meet up whenever you want. I‚Äôll always make you a priority. I‚Äôm excited about building something meaningful with you.""

She didn‚Äôt respond for a day, and when she did, this is what she said:

>""Hey, sorry for the slowwww response‚Ä¶ It was nice to see you. I appreciate you being there for me! I‚Äôm still not sure it‚Äôs a good idea to keep meeting up. In my mind, that‚Äôs a casual thing, and it feels like it would be a waste of time for both of us. I‚Äôm happy to stay friends, but nothing more.""

I didn‚Äôt push it. We had occasional back-and-forth conversations, but her responses became slower. So, I went no-contact for a week. During that time, she liked one of my Instagram stories. I texted her again, and her response was quick but it went kind of distant once asked if she wanted to grab a friendly brunch, and she said she had plans. I offered a different time, and she said she had some personal stuff and needed space. I was fine with that, and she took another week to reply, saying she was fine.

To clear things up, I sent her a voice note:

>I am glad she is feeling well and I also wanted to talk her about something and I have been reflecting on lately..we both had really good chemistry and we got amazing connection in person and I know the dynamics have changed and I am completely fine with it but still I want to continue this connection even if it‚Äôs in a different capacity‚Ä¶that‚Äôs why I asked for a brunch or a coffee and you also know that I am not big texted as well‚Ä¶I can understand if you need more time to hangout with me in person which is totally fine and agreeable but I just want to know how and what you feel so that I know we both are in the same page‚Ä¶yeah that‚Äôs it..I hope you enjoy your day, I‚Äôll speak to you later, take your time no worries, let me know.

She took another week to respond with:

>Hey, sorry for the late response. hey sorry, I listened to your voice note when you first sent but took me sometime to respond ..I think that I agree we got along really well but I just think if we kept meeting up then I don‚Äôt think it would really help either of us..I think it would be different if we were friends beige and something happened and then you like that‚Ä¶it would be different like that..it was always more than friends from the very beginning so I think it wouldn‚Äôt be very useful and I also feel if we did meetup because of the way we behaved around each other was flirty and more than friends the dynamics would so different it wouldn‚Äôt like it was before you know what I mean I think it woood be better for both of us to leave it for now anyways‚Ä¶I mean who knows what might happen but that‚Äôs how I feel I hope you are doing well and I saw that you are in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ very jealous and I hope you are doing alright

>I responded:

>No worries, I appreciate you opening up about how you feel‚Äîit helps a lot. Haha, sadly \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ isn‚Äôt my favorite place in Scotland‚Äîno offense!

>She replied:

>No offense taken! \_\_\_\_\_\_ has sentimental value to me, so that‚Äôs why I like it. What‚Äôs your favorite place then?

>I said:

>\_\_\_\_\_ is my happy place. It gives me strength, and I can see myself spending my last days there. ‚ù§Ô∏è \_\_\_\_\_\_ sounds special to you‚Äîwould you say it‚Äôs your happy place?

>She responded:

>That‚Äôs cute üòä yeah, \_\_\_\_\_\_ is definitely a home away from home üè°!  
Then I reacted heart to her message and ended it

**To be noted:**

*We met at a social in mid-May, started flirting the first week of June, and then had the date in mid-July. Things ended at the end of August (Coffee Shop). We were dating exclusively, and we were like actual couples‚Äîvery romantic.*

**Today is Day 1 of NC, which is very difficult because I really like her.**

It makes it even more hard to control NC because

1. We are still talking and connected on Social Media. My social media stories are about my day-to-day stuff, similar to Vlogging.
2. She is in my friends' whatsapp group, so she knows everything I do.
3. I don't know anything she does or what she is up to..yeah she is socially inactive.
4. I never let my emotions to her...because I didn't want to hurt her and ruin my chances of getting back with her....deep down now I want to vent to her.

I have been in serious long-term relationships before but this seems to be the hardest!!! I don't know how to control and do No Contact..so I need your support and it is annoying!",1,1728982720.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

1g43a6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdindia/comments/1g43a6w/how_do_i_study/,How do I study?,"I've never been to a therapist, but I‚Äôve always felt different from others, even from a very young age. Making friends has always been hard, and now I barely have any meaningful friendships. I‚Äôve dealt with anxiety and procrastination for as long as I can remember always putting things off till the very last moment,  never finishing assignments on time. I somehow passed exams by cramming the night before until the 9th grade, but now in college, I feel utterly clueless and unable to speak with seniors, teachers, or many of my classmates. I feel like the most awkward person on earth, and social gatherings cause me so much stress that I either have a mental breakdown or burst out in anger.

My anxiety keeps me from standing up for myself, and I often can‚Äôt handle waiting in lines or staying still. By 10th grade, I slipped into depression, and it lasted for almost 3‚Äì4 years. I couldn‚Äôt figure out why back then, but now I think my inability to focus and the pressure of my career, along with personal issues, made things worse.

In 11th and 12th grades, studying was nearly impossible for me. I‚Äôd drift off during lectures, and my JEE prep was almost non-existent. Somehow, I managed to get 85% in my board exams, mostly due to pulling all-nighters and living on coffee, which eventually got me into an engineering college. But after the boards, during the 5-6 months before college started, my depression hit its worst point. I avoided going out, slept to escape reality, and had suicidal thoughts.

Once college began, the depression eased a bit, but I still don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù During my last semester exams, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn‚Äôt study. I wasted hours scrolling on social media or opening lecture videos only to zone out after 5 minutes. For my math exam, I had two days off to study, but I couldn‚Äôt focus for most of it. I ended up passing by pure luck. That‚Äôs when I stumbled upon a video about ADHD, and it explained so much of what I had been experiencing.

Now, I‚Äôm struggling to focus on anything‚Äîstudying or coding feels impossible. Even when I try to force myself, I somehow end up wasting time. With only about 4 hours left after my college day (which includes 8 hours of classes and 3 hours of commuting), I‚Äôm exhausted and can‚Äôt accomplish anything. I still have two years until I graduate, and I want a good job, but my skills are almost non-existent because I can‚Äôt focus long enough to build them.

I haven‚Äôt told my parents about this because my mom just calls me lazy. I‚Äôm planning to see a psychologist once I graduate and get a job, but in the meantime, I could really use some advice on how to manage myself better and, if possible, how to talk to my parents about this.",1,1728982614.0,adhdindia,1,0.67,False

Galing ako ng Born Again Christian Church at nag-serve doon ng limang taon. Fast forward, nagka-COVID at siguro kasi wala naman tayong choice kundi tumutok sa phone natin. Hanggang sa narinig ko si BES youtube, no doubt nagagalingan talaga ako sa kanya. Inaya ko pa partner ko then sabay kaming na-bautismuhan. Pucha akala ko ganun lang, diba nung doktrina saglit lang? Umasa akong ganun lang. Hindi ko alam na meron palang PM, WS, at PBB. Let's say 3 hours parehas sa PM at WS at 6 hours naman sa PBB. That's 12 hours per week 24 hours in two weeks at 48 hours sa isang buwan, hindi pa kasama ang oras ng biyahe mo papuntang lokal. Bukod dito, meron pang Leaf Letting at Linis Lokal at kung negosyante ka napakaling bagay ng mga oras na yun.

Nung namatay si BES, umiyak pa ako nun kasi naniniwala akong may gift siya sa understanding ng Bible. Pero ang turning point is nung si KDR na yung humawak, sa totoo lang naumay kasi ako sa topic niyang palaging introduction (kailan ka ba mapupunta mismo sa topic). Naalala ko nun isang buong sabado nasa lokal lang ako, pusang gala ang sakit ng pwet ko. Dumating ako sa lokal ng 2pm tapos 1am na ako nakalabas kasi ini-straight ko hanggang PBB. Meron pang 4 hours na recap, ganun ba ka-tanga yung mga miyembro para ulit-ulitin? At yung AVP ni Josel, feeling ko parang pinagtitripan lang ako. Meron ding time na pinapatawag kami ng partner ko sa lokal kasi meron akong post sa Facebook na naka-akbay sa kanya, ang weird lang dapat ba straight body kami parehas parang militar? Nalaman ko rin na bawal palang manuod ng sine, dito talaga ako nagulat kasi pamper time ko yun at yun ang stress reliever ko noon pa man. Bawal daw magsuot ng skinny jeans kasi nang-aakit ng masasamang mata (gets ko naman yung point na 'to). 

Sobrang daming bawal kainan which led me into thinking na hindi kaya bawal lahat yan kasi merong business na BES House of Chicken? You can control your customers by putting a demand on your product at yun ay ang pagbabawal sa kanilang kumain sa market competition mo. Isa pang napansin ko, napakarami talaga ng target at nakaka-overwhelm. Aminin niyo merong 20k or more na target kahit sa kabataan lang at sa isang project lang yun. Yung pera sanang nilalaan para sa mga Wish Concerts ay sanang ipinapang-ayos sa mga lokal na lang. Thankful ako dahil nawala yung pag-inom ko at wala na akong balak maging manginginom kahit matagal na akong hindi dumadalo at umalis na rin sa mga GC namin. Naramdaman ko na this religion is limiting me, ang dami kong gustong gawin sa buhay bilang kabataan, I want to explore and I think God gave this curiousity to explore His creations. Paano ka makakapag-ipon kung palagi kayong naghahabol sa target? In the first place, paano ka makakapag-explore kung lagi kang nasa lokal, wala ka na bang buhay? 

After being in MCGI since COVID, malaya na ako, luckily wala naman akong relative na kapatid kaya ganun lang kadali. I am now attending to another Christian Church that takes only 1 hour and 20 minutes every sunday and I feel great about it (free coffee, sugar, milk pa). I really don't care kung anong sabihin nila sa akin, I am not a bad person after all, I just want my freedom. And religion should not force you to decide staying with them. I am not saying all these para siraan ang MCGI, I am saying all these to release what is inside me. Kung magiging better person ka sa loob, continue doing it and I would be happy. Pero kung hindi na, you have your own mind and heart and you should follow them.

This document is a fraudulent relic, but unfortunately, its dangerous legacy endures. In the annals of history, few texts have been as instrumental in shaping paranoid delusions and outright hatred as this one. But the real question at hand is: Did¬†**Adolf Hitler**, the man responsible for one of history's most unfathomable atrocities, actually buy into this garbage? And if he did, how did it warp his already twisted worldview?

Let‚Äôs dissect this with brutal honesty and just the right dose of biting sarcasm, because while the subject matter is grim, the absurdity of it all deserves some sharp edges. Spoiler alert: it‚Äôs going to get dark.

**The Protocols: A Work of Fiction... That Wasn't Treated Like One**

For the uninitiated (or blessedly unaware), the Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a completely bogus document that was fabricated in¬†**Tsarist**¬†[**Russia**](https://theinformer.uk/)¬†around the turn of the 20th century. It claims to be the minutes of a secret meeting of¬†**Jewish leaders**¬†plotting global domination. You know, because that‚Äôs apparently what people believed: that¬†**Jewish elders**¬†gathered like some comic book villain collective, twirling their mustaches, ready to take over the world.

And here‚Äôs the kicker: the document was a complete and utter forgery, plagiarized from various earlier works of political satire and conspiracy, yet it was taken as gospel by anti-Semitic factions desperate for a reason to justify their hate.

Fast forward to¬†**Germany**¬†in the 1920s and 30s, a period where economic despair, social instability, and nationalist fervor were setting the stage for the perfect storm of fascism. This is where the Protocols landed in front of a young, ambitious Adolf Hitler.

**Hitler: The Poster Boy for Conspiracy Theories**

***Did Hitler actually believe in the Protocols?***¬†Well, yes and no. But mostly, yes‚Äîbecause facts weren‚Äôt exactly his forte, and nuance wasn‚Äôt really his strong suit either.

Hitler was a man who thrived on simplified, black-and-white narratives. Why engage in the messy complexities of economics, geopolitics, or the long-standing history of European antisemitism when you could point at one group and say,

>

For Hitler, the Protocols of the Elders of Zion fit perfectly into the pre-existing anti-Semitic propaganda he devoured like candy. Whether or not he believed every word of the Protocols is almost beside the point because he certainly wanted it to be true. The Protocols offered a handy framework that supported the grandiose, paranoid delusions that would later manifest in his infamous book,¬†[**Mein Kampf**](https://theinformer.uk/t/mein-kampf). The idea of a¬†**global Jewish conspiracy**¬†dovetailed nicely with Hitler‚Äôs belief in racial purity, Aryan superiority, and the need for a scapegoat to blame for Germany‚Äôs post-World War I humiliation.

**How the Protocols Fueled Hitler‚Äôs Worldview**

The real tragedy here is not just that Hitler believed in the Protocols (because, let‚Äôs face it, he believed in a lot of ridiculous things), but that he used them to justify and legitimise a genocidal ideology.

**The Eternal Jew Myth**: Hitler didn‚Äôt just see Jews as bad actors within Germany. He believed in a global, coordinated Jewish conspiracy‚Äîsomething the Protocols conveniently supported. Hitler‚Äôs vision wasn‚Äôt limited to expelling or marginalising¬†**Jews in Germany**; he saw them as an existential threat to humanity, particularly to the Aryan race, which he considered the pinnacle of¬†**human evolution**. This was a convenient narrative, one that he could wield to unify the German population around a common enemy.

A Convenient Scapegoat for Economic Troubles:¬†**Germany‚Äôs economic**¬†woes in the 1920s and 30s were complex, stemming from war reparations, inflation, and the general chaos of the post-war years. But complexity doesn‚Äôt exactly fire up nationalist fervor, does it? Enter the Protocols, which provided a tidy explanation for why the German economy was floundering. Forget bad policies or war debts‚Äîit‚Äôs the Jews pulling the strings behind the scenes! Hitler exploited this narrative, portraying Jews as economic manipulators who thrived off the misery of the¬†**German people**.

**A Justification for Genocide**: Hitler‚Äôs belief in the Protocols wasn‚Äôt just ideological; it was instrumental in setting the stage for the¬†**Holocaust**.¬†**The Protocols**¬†painted Jews not merely as individuals with differing beliefs or cultures, but as a global cabal that had to be eradicated for the greater good of humanity. And so, Hitler‚Äôs

>

wasn‚Äôt just about cleansing¬†**Germany of Jews**; it was, in his mind, about protecting the world from the insidious influence he was convinced they wielded.¬†**The Holocaust**, under this grotesque logic, was not merely an act of cruelty it was a defensive move to preserve the ‚Äúpurity‚Äù of the Aryan race.

**Hitler‚Äôs Use of the Protocols in Nazi Propaganda**

While Hitler wasn‚Äôt the kind of guy to sit down with a cup of coffee and read through the Protocols line by line, his cronies sure did.¬†**Joseph Goebbels**, the¬†**Nazi propaganda**¬†minister and Hitler‚Äôs right-hand man when it came to public manipulation, frequently referenced the Protocols in speeches, films, and pamphlets. The Nazi propaganda machine used the Protocols to stoke fear, distrust, and hatred towards Jews on a mass scale, weaving the document‚Äôs false claims into the larger fabric of¬†**Nazi ideology**.

Even beyond Germany‚Äôs borders, the Protocols were distributed across Europe and the¬†**Middle East**, infecting the public consciousness with anti-Semitic lies that, sadly, persist in some regions today.

**The Absurdity of it All**

What‚Äôs mind-blowing about the entire saga of the Protocols is not just that people believed it‚Äîbut that they wanted to believe it. Hitler and his followers didn‚Äôt care whether the document was real; they cared that it was useful. It gave them a narrative that made sense of their anger, their shame, and their nationalistic fervour. It was a short-circuit solution for people looking for someone to blame, a tale so absurd that its audacity made it compelling to those already predisposed to antisemitism.

Think about it: If the Protocols hadn‚Äôt existed, would Hitler have come up with another way to justify his worldview? Absolutely. But the Protocols were there, and like a match to dry kindling, they ignited the fire of a world-changing catastrophe.

**What Can We Learn?**

So, did Hitler believe in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion? Yes. But more than that, he needed to believe in them. He needed the myth of a global Jewish conspiracy to frame his ambitions, to justify the horrors he would unleash, and to rally a nation around his toxic ideology.

The real takeaway here is how easily a lie can take root when it‚Äôs wrapped in fear and bigotry. The Protocols were proven false time and time again, but that didn‚Äôt matter to the people who wanted them to be true. Hitler exploited that desire, and the result was one of the darkest chapters in¬†**human history**.

As grim as it sounds, we still see this playbook in use today. Modern-day conspiracy theories follow the same pattern: a simple, emotionally charged lie that plays on people‚Äôs fears, feeding off of societal unrest and mistrust.¬†**The Protocols**, though long debunked, remind us that lies‚Äîeven blatant ones‚Äîcan have far-reaching, catastrophic consequences.

**Let's Conclude: The Danger of Believing in Convenient Lies**

Hitler didn‚Äôt need proof that the Protocols of the Elders of Zion were true. All he needed was the emotional weight they carried, the scapegoat they provided, and the convenient narrative they spun. He wielded them like a weapon‚Äîtwisting a fraudulent document into a justification for mass murder. And the rest, as they say, is history.

Let that sink in the next time you encounter a¬†**‚Äúharmless‚Äù**¬†conspiracy theory. The Protocols of the Elders of Zion were once seen as ridiculous, too. Until they weren‚Äôt.

he asked me to be his gf the same day we had sex for the first time (hangout #4?). I was taken aback by him asking, but I was pumped with serotonin so I said yes‚Ä¶.
I believe that was also the same day when I found out he was going to move out of state in a few weeks to help out his grandparents with dementia (I knew this before having intercourse with him. Just wanted live my life) 

We both have expressed that :
1. We‚Äôre both looking for a serious relationship
2. we both want to be exclusive to eachother
3. we both are willing to wait for eachother‚Ä¶. 
The thing is, neither of us know how long that will be. 

I‚Äôm still in college and have about 2 more semesters to finish up. I can‚Äôt be moving to a different state- especially for my boyfriend who I kinda just met. It feels weird to call him my boyfriend since it was so fast, but I do want us to work out- we really do get on quite nicely, and we had a lot of empathetic connection in just in the 4-5 weeks we were able to still hangout in person. 

I dropped him off at the airport the day he left. He had me come by his parent‚Äôs house just before and I met his mom and grandma. His mom and I immediately hit it off. 

All the flags have been green so far, except of course: he‚Äôs living in on another coast now and neither of us know when the next time we‚Äôre gonna see each other is.

1g42sz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mito/comments/1g42sz0/brainfog_tips_a_question_about_coffee/,"Brainfog tips, a question about coffee","Hi again, I'm currently in the process of trying to turn my life around in addition to pursuing a diagnosis and I got a question. What do you do to combat the insane brainfog every day? It didn't bother me as much when I basically lived in my bed and just took care of my cat, but now I'm trying to study to get into university and honestly, it's harder than pushing through all the pain and physical everyday tasks.

As it stands, I reduce the pace of my studying as my cognitive ability drops and when it gets to the point where I'm basically just staring at letters, I go for a walk or take care of something physical, but that usually just leaves me even more tired and I have to give up. I know able-bodied people use coffee to get through their 8 hour shifts everyday and I've heard coffee might be beneficial to mitochondrial processes going on, but I don't want to become dependent on it if it doesn't help, and from my limited experience with it, it doesn't seem to touch the brainfog, just makes me less sleepy, which is an entirely different feeling than the usual fatigue and brainfog. 

Have you found coffee helpful for any sort of mental tasks, whether it's work, studying or even a hobby? How else do you deal with brainfog? Any input is greatly appreciated, I hope everyone is doing okay today :)",1,1728980218.0,mito,0,1.0,False
