Good morning everyone  let me introduce myself for those that do not know, my name is Joe and I am the owner of the small barbershop nestled in between draper's jewelry and the Well coffee House on Granny White pike. I Would like you to know a little bit about the shop, the shop has a 70 plus year history I myself have owned it for the last 10 years and the previous owner before me Al riddell owned it for 53 years before retiring and there was an owner before him unfortunately I do not know his name. I am reaching out to the Green hills community to let them know of my situation. After years of service to this community I was informed by Lipscomb University that they were not going to offer me a new lease simply because they want something else. That's right 70 plus year old barbershop that has long served the neighborhood and community is simply being told goodbye because they have decided they want something else. And I am being told that they're not even sure that the something else is going to come. I'm not a young man and having to start over again at this point in my life it's going to be almost impossible , I still have two teenage boys at home that depend on me and my business is how I provide for them.  Plus several years ago I was diagnosed with stage 3 kidney disease and it is imperative that I maintain my insurance to be able to successfully maintain my health. The powers to be at Lipscomb are well aware of this but still are not going to let me stay. I have been looking for the last 9 months for an alternative location unsuccessfully. You see there are plenty of places of $1,500 to 2,000 ft and above available. I cannot afford nor do I need that large of a space. My current space is of 320 ft. I don't know if posting about this will do any good but I just thought that the Green hills community / Lipscomb community should be informed about Lipscomb forcing yet another small mom and pop business out of existence. My plan was to work until I can retire and then sell my business and sail in to the sunset , literally I plan to go south. But I am being forced closed due to the decision of what I was informed in an email was made by the  CFO at Lipscomb who made the decision. I'm posting this in order to be able to reach a majority of my customers that I know live in the Green hills area. My end date here at the shop is April 30th I am hoping that they will soften their heart and change their mind and let me continue to stay at least until I can get my two remaining teenage boys graduated from high school and off to college. Thanks for your time sincerely Joe Eagles DBA Joe's barbershop.",1,1737562280.0,nashville,0,1.0,False

Changing from an Atom > Niche- small reduction in flavour for the 'good shots' but a massive uptick in better consistency and workflow.

Tell me how can a save this relationship.?,"I met an amazing man in July and we dated for 3.5 months before I had to go back to the U.S. because I wanted to figure out my career and I wanted to buy a land in our island so I told him I am going back for us to the U.S. just to make money. In this three months that we are long distance it was very hard lots of fights. He would cry a lot and tell me he doesn’t even remember kissing me anymore. That he can’t feel me. He said he doesn’t find joy on anything. I am an estp  so in my mind I was thinking he need to hold it together because I’m doing this for us. Anyway the fight continues one time he had a terrible anxiety and couldn’t even move crying and telling me to come home:( fast forward I ended up seeking help from a therapist as I was really down from not seeing him and also for grieving my missing pup in May. So I think it affected as well my happiness with my relationship with this enfp. When we were together we had fights but we had an amazing love. Talk about having a life together and even saves dogs and wanted to build a sanctuary this is why I came to the US but now I failed as my mental health took a turn. We had a fight last week on messages where I broke it off and completely told him hurtful words about his character.

Two days later I sent him a message saying how ashamed I am with my behavior and what I said to him is how I felt about myself. I cried a lot I know I made a mistake. I’m supposed to go home and we would live together but during that fight I did say put all my stuff back in my apartment.. now I am going home in a week he shut me out blocked me on social media and blocked me on WhatsApp only communication are on text message and him saying we can talk in person. He said to me after i apologized that he feels numb, that he doesn’t feel the love. I don’t know if he is a siting all of this because he is angry and it was only 4 days after our fight when he said all of this. I think we might be breaking up for good but I want to atleast try and salvage this because we have such bigs dreams together.

His mom is visiting during the time I’m coming home in our island from Germany so I don’t know if that’s the best or worst for me..
Anyway during our meeting I want to tell him how sorry i am. How ashamed I am and I know how I hurt him with my actions and my words. I want to tell him I don’t want our relationship before. I want something different I want us to go back to getting to know each other, being present and create new memories. I want to tell him If he give me a chance that I will prove to him it will be worth it. I want to show that the love we have is real. I don’t want the pressure of the future I just want us to build the foundation of now. I know my words hurt him deeply I want to tell him I will build his trust again. 

He is a very emotional enfp. He cries and not afraid to show that vulnerable side. I was taken back by it as an estp woman. Anyway I want to atleast try and see if we can still fix things. Tell me is him shutting me out for two weeks means his completely done with me? How can I fix this. I’m scared to see him. Any enfp men want to tell me what I can do to fix this? 

I am also coming back with gifts for his mom and  for him that I accumulated it’s all genuine gift one is a mug personalized for him with our face coffees, bag wallet clothes  cards saying I will make it up our time that was lost.

Let me know how can I make it up to an ENFP that I hurt so much with my words and my actions

This would increase applications without increasing the number of applicants. 

Not saying that this would account for all increases in application volume but it would be interesting to see measured.

There’s this app called Affirm which appears to be something like a payday loan company and has bizarre commercials.  The most annoying one has a bride-to-be trying on an heirloom dress in front of her mother and grandmother.  On the coffee table is a spread containing foodstuffs such as jam and gravy (I guess because they wanted to have a nice lunch for the get-together).  Well, the bride apparently thinks the family heirloom dress is too old-fashioned & dowdy for her and wants a new dress, so what does she do?  She “accidentally on purpose” falls onto the coffee table slowly and deliberately pours & rubs the food & condiments all over herself while making exaggerated & fake “Oh, no!” comments.  The grandmother looks at her blankly before telling her, “Just buy the dress,” which the bridezilla does.   


I’m sorry, is this supposed to be funny?  It’s just some overgrown brat ruining a family heirloom instead of using any tact or politeness.  Intentionally destroying things can be funny, but not like this.  Also, why does she need grandma’s permission to buy a dress or use the Affirm app?  Why are her relatives just taking all this and giving in to her?  The relatives should have told her, “Well, I guess you’ll be standing at the altar in a stained dress!  Too bad!

*April 22, 2024*

I 24M teach boxing in my spare time, and one day a week, I teach it to kids.

There's a mom who i'm starting to feel like is taking advantage of these classes.

She's increasingly late with picking up her kid after the session.

To give some context, this is a rich woman. It's not that she's out working a job. She is a stay at home parent. No other kids. She told me all this because another thing she loves to do is have really long conversations with me on top of already being late.

She's been late most of March (3 classes). I talked to her about it at the end of the month and she apologized and said it won't happen again. It did. x2 now. So I started timing her.

The second week of April (no class the first week), she arrived 45 minutes late. Then spent maybe 20 minutes talking to me. The other day, I timed her again. She got there around the 1 hour mark. I made a point to show her my timer and I gave her a warning that I will remove her kid from my class. She still tried to continue argue at which point I raised the timer and turned it on again. She said I was being 'unjustifiably rude' (exact words).

I explained (politely) that I have other obligations and her consistent lateness throws my schedule off.

She got all furious and stomped to the driver's side of her car. Her kid rolled down his window to say thank you and 'bye' to me. I told him bye and added 'tell your mom to stop being late'.

She reported our conversation to my boss saying that I told her kid he will get kicked out of the program. I didn't say that. My boss still gave me a lecture about how I don't have that power and can't make the statements I did. He went over professionalism and how i'm being too hard on this mom who could have other circumstances going on.

I do have a bit of a cold vibe and I'm working on that.

But i'm not getting paid for the hour after this class that I spend hanging out with her kid.

The kid's great.. but I have things to do.

For people who work with kids, what's the etiquette here? do I give parents grace?

Unfortunately, I don't think my boss has any policy around it judging from the way our conversation went. If this continues to be an issue, I'm going to push for compensation since his approach currently has me taking responsibility for it. I'll send an email to him about clarifying so I have some kind of a written response.

There is no front desk. I didn't want to immediately escalate to CPS and cops before making some attempts with the mom. The (lack of?) policy is definitely an issue.. that I am now going to push to address/seek further info about.

*May 2, 2024, 10 days later*

I appreciate the advice I got on the post I made. I learned a lot from you.

A little bit of background on me. This is my first time working a job that involves kids. My actual profession is unrelated to boxing. This was mostly something I picked up spontaneously, because I saw the merit in it and I wanted to do my part to help. The program itself is very new and disorganized. Due to differences of opinion about how its run, I doubt I will stay with it.

Here's the update:

I took various notes from the people who gave me tips here. I wrote a detailed email to my boss and cc'd other people who run this program, including co-instructors. I did this for transparency, accountability, and to put pressure on my boss to provide a policy around the issue instead of him dealing with us all individually / case by case.

My boss didn't respond to the email, instead he called me in to see him. I kind of had a feeling though.

He asked me why I sent the email cc'ing everyone and was clearly not happy about my approach. He kept trying to minimize the situation, and make me feel that I am in the wrong. He told me that I'm being greedy. That my attitude about one parent being late is exaggerated and I'm looking for problems. I should essentially just wait around after-hours if I need to sometimes (unpaid) because it's a program for kids, and I should do it with some heart. ""Do it for the kids"". I had to turn my face to hide the fact that I wanted to laugh in that moment. Having proper policy in place not only protects the staff, it protects the kids, not to mention his fucking business. After I made my perspective a little more clear (in a mostly professional manner).. he came around a little.

Unfortunately, he flat out told me he will not back-pay me for the time that I've logged waiting for this mom, but he will implement a late policy moving forward. He's followed through on that. He tried to throw in other incentives for me. I didn't accept them.

That mom wasn't late this week. She did try to catch my eye when she picked her son up and I ignored her. She ended up getting out of her car and asked me if I saw her waving. I kept ignoring her. She wore me down because she kept following me around while I locked up. I informed her why she's getting the silent treatment. She apologized and also tried to write me a check on the spot. I didn't take the money. I told her... honestly, I might quit instead.

I am not sure about it though. I am on the fence about just letting this go and playing it by ear class to class. Maybe the program will get smoother with time. It's not that much money anyway...

I haven't proof-read this lol but it looks longer than I wanted it to be. I'm sorry.

*January 22, 2025, 9 months later*

Hey so it's been a long time. I deleted the original posts off my page hoping I would stop getting messages about it. But now I have this update. Is it allowed? I don't remember the etiquette here.

I found that my post is still on Reddit. Someone DM'd it to me. Catch up [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1cw6m4s/i_think_this_woman_is_using_me_for_freechildcare/).

The short of it is you guys were right, this woman had a crush on me or some kind of interest in the least.. and I was too angry at her / the situation to notice. We're seeing each other now. I won't get your hopes up because it's probably just temporary.

Longer story: Towards the end of last year she approached me. She said she was separating from her husband and hinted that the marriage was abusive. She said her reason for getting in touch with me was to take me up on my offer about teaching her how to box. I told her I was only offering (back then) so I could make her suffer.

The thing is,  I don't think joining a combat sport immediately as a means to process abuse is always the best form of action. I get why it's empowering but if you're not doing therapy or something alongside it.. it might frame things for you in an unhealthy way. So I think you need both. That's just my personal opinion. I felt ill-equipped to be the starting point of her healing or whatever, even though she was reaching out to me so sincerely.

So I redirected her to someone else.

She started going to those classes I connected her with and occasionally texted me about them. Straightforward texts, questions, asking me my opinion etc. We'd have short exchanges, a few texts back and forth with no pattern and a lot of gaps in between.

About a week ago, I ran into her in person and she convinced me to have coffee with her and..

I don't know how to explain it. There is some kind of intensity between us and we decided to see where it leads.

[It's not serious](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i71r74/comment/m8h7p4d/). 

Given how many people thought something was there and how oblivious I was to it... I felt this might be worth sharing.

I didn't know her age back then but I found out she's 32. I'm 25. (I know).

I can't argue about me being a fool but I disagree about it being unprofessional.

To clarify: I don't teach the kid, I dropped that mess of a class early last year, and I don't teach her either. I declined her offer when she first reached out to me and redirected her to someone else who I have no affiliation with.

- 

I get it. But I'm not trying to be in a relationship and that's clear between us.

My roasts are generally okay, better than buying roasted beans at the grocery store. But in reading/watching all the roasting theory articles and videos online, I have a basic knowledge of the vocabulary, but where to start improving my roasts still evades me. The suggestions I find online seem all over the place (i.e. you need more time in this phase, you need less time in that phase, you need to use high heat and lower fan, you need to use low heat and higher fan).  I think some of the confusions come in a difference in drum roasting vs air roasting.  I also realize that there are other important variables like the bean itself, your specific machine, probe location, electrical differences, different desired tastes, and type of brew. All of those are very important.  But, there has to be a general, basic starting point from which to start making changes, that produces a good roast to start from, as opposed to bad roasting profiles that just won't produce good roasts no matter what.  I've created a template based on the information I've found on here and elsewhere, and I've attached the graph.  I'd appreciate some insights on it. If you, hypothetically, produced this exact profile with any average bean, what would you expect? Good? Bad? Baked? Where would you expect to need to make changes, and if you're willing to explain, why would you expect to make those changes? I'd appreciate any insights to get me moving towards improving my coffee. Thanks.

A UX designer with too much coffee and a wild imagination. 💡 Presenting my concept for the JioStar, a seamless streaming universe that doesn't just *stream*, but *dreams*. ✨

**Key Ideas:**

1️⃣ Two Platforms

Disney+ Hotstar has been rebranded to simply, ""Hotstar"" & now caters to the metropolitan binge-watchers (usual HBO-watching, coffee-sipping crowd).

Vistar (the rebranded, JioCinema) serves the pan-India content connoisseurs, local flavors, grassroots vibes, and nostalgia-packed storytelling.

[That's one way to divide Hostar & JioCinema's content](https://preview.redd.it/21nyzg44fkee1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9b6b68017c584d21705240f562fd21202ad0055)

2️⃣ Hotstar Upgrades

An AI-powered GPT-style search that’s smarter than your cousin who “knows movies.” Just type, ""That movie where SRK says 'Don’t underestimate the power of a common man',"" and boom, it’s there.

Watch Party: Stream with friends AND celebrities. Ever wanted to hear your favorite actor roast their own dialogue live? Now you can.

3️⃣ Vistar Rebranding

Think of it as JioCinema’s glow-up. Homegrown content in an interface inspired by the best of both worlds. Basically, a UI so intuitive, it practically reads your mind.

Most items are fine, but some days and some packages....I just don't get it.  Clothes inside out or covered in dry, flaky skin (like inside the legs and waistband) or hair - pet and human.  You don't have to wash it (usually, but if you spilled coffee on it...), but at least shake it off a little, turn it right side out, and at least attempt a simple fold.  Pulling it off, leaving arms or legs inside out  and rolling it into a ball and putting it in a box isn't nice.  There are real people on the other end who have to handle it.

  And we don't need your trash - all of the packaging you got for Christmas, like the plastic bags, packing peanuts, etc.  It's a shirt.  It doesn't need extra padding in the mail to ship it back.  

And please don't order something this year that you've had for 10 years and return the 10 year old item in it's place.  You're not fooling anyone.  You may get your money (though not usually), but it wastes our time and it's still stealing if you get away with it.

That said - here's a tip for saving money.  Pay attention to the return policies and labels.  If customers use our labels, it costs about $6, regardless of size or weight of the return box/bag.

1. Didn't offer to pay for the first date. Asked to split the bill a couple of times, even for coffee. (I guess that's ok? I personally feel like it's a gentleman's trait to offer to pay) 
2. Finds cooking and cleaning tiring - started doing it only 6 months ago, but does not want a maid.
3. Shares similar thoughts like faith, ambition, is cautious of his mental health and appreciates people who are honest. 
4. Wants something serious - feels a little calculated. He's 33 years old and still calls his mom to Bangalore from Mumbai to cook for him - does not want to spend on a maid for some reason. Also, he did tell me that he has friends (girls) come home to cook for him, but if that bothers me he will completely cut that off. (Continuation of point 2)
5. Doesn't really like cats, but seems to be willing to accept it - not a deal breaker for him apparently. Hates fur though, so not sure if he just said it for my sake.
6. Good physic. Not tough on the eyes. 
7. Likes travelling, very outgoing. Very very extroverted. 
8. Felt frustrated taking care of his mom in the hospital. Understandable though in a way I guess - had important presentation coming up, but also mentioned that she needs to take care of her health as he needs to move on and focus on getting a partner for himself.",1,1737560694.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False
1i7e0z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/borderlands3/comments/1i7e0z7/the_humour_problem/,The “humour” problem,"The problem with borderlands 3 vs borderlands 2 humour is that 3 doesn’t connect the humour to the characters. Here is an example for what I mean:

 Handsome jack had a mission where you check on his grandma for him. Super weird and random and very silly but still funny. We find bandits there (who we kill) and handsome jack reveals to us that he hired them to kill his grandmother and is now happy that we killed them so he doesn’t have to pay them. This is a hilarious mission that fits with the crazy narcissist personality that is handsome jack. It’s dark, it’s twisted, and outrageous making it pretty silly and funny.

Now borderlands 3 missions and humour don’t add to the character or reinforce what the character is. Instead they do something that is silly and not connected at all. Here’s an example:

In borderlands 3 on Promethea we are introduced to Lorelei. We see her handle some COV pretty gruesomely and in her title card she is described as a “bloody badass.” Her very first side mission is to make you get coffee for her at a coffee shop because she misses coffee.

1i7dzae,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1i7dzae/roughly_25_days_in_my_uneventful_disappointing/,"Roughly 25 days in - my uneventful (disappointing?) experience so far -- not much good, but also not much bad.  Just offering this up as an alternative to some of the more extreme experiences that get posted on this sub","40M, 5'10, 155 lbs, exercise first thing in the morning for 30-60 minutes, always before any coffee.  Generally eat moderately healthy but nothing extreme.  For about a decade I've had 1 cup of half-caf and 1 cup of decaf per day, with very occasional (once/week or less) higher caffeine intake.  Half-caf was finished by 8am and never had any meaningful caffeine at all after 10am (possibly like a piece of chocolate here or there occasionally).  Best guess is that I averaged about 90mg caffeine per day over any rolling 7 day period.  So not a huge caffeine drinker compared to many of you.

In late December I started a \~10 day taper where I got rid of the half-caf entirely and was doing 100% decaf.  After a day or two of decaf only, I tapered the decaf down to zero over 3-4 days, and was at zero caffeine around January 10.  So all in I'm \~25+ days of reduced caffeine of which \~13 days is zero caffeine.

Gotta say, it's been anticlimactic / uneventful.  Because of the gradual taper to zero, I never really had any headaches -- certainly not any bad ones that required medicine.  I might have had a few days of somewhat higher fatigue than normal, but honestly nothing I could clearly attribute to lack of caffeine because it was pretty minor fatigue if anything.

No improvements to sleep.  If anything sleep might be a little worse, but again, such a minor difference that I couldn't really say that the caffeine detox has played a role.

No real noticeable improvements to mood or anxiety.  It's possible that my mood and anxiety might be a TINY bit improved, but, again, it's barely noticeable if it's there at all.

(TMI warning for this paragraph) Not much change to digestion / BMs.  Went from Bristol type 6/7 to Bristol type 4, which is an improvement, but that has been accompanied by some very minor constipation which at least as of now hasn't really been a noteworthy issue.

The one and only objective, definite benefit I can say I have is simply that the dependency is gone.  On my old daily coffee schedule, I'd have a bad headache by 8 or 9am if I missed my morning half-caf.  It's very nice not to feel a slave to that, even though it was only ever a problem a few days per year when I was travelling or something.

So bottom line... As a previously moderate (90 mg/day) caffeine drinker with an otherwise healthy lifestyle, I'm not really seeing any major pros or cons to eliminating my morning coffee, at least not yet.

I'm planning to stick with it for at least a full 100 days to see if anything changes.  If nothing much changes from what I'm experiencing now, I don't know if I'll return to my old coffee routine or not.  I honestly don't miss it that much.  But I am also increasingly of the view that it wasn't really harming me in any noticeable way.  So who knows.  Time will tell.

1i7dw8c,https://i.redd.it/o8a80k8xekee1.jpeg,"SF's Crosstown Trail, Sunday February 16th 8:45 / 10 AM - 6 PM!","OK Reddit, for February's group hike we'll do San Francisco's Crosstown Trail northbound in one fell swoop! [Here's a link](https://crosstowntrail.org/crosstown-trail/) to the trail's website, and [here's a link](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/san-francisco-crosstown-trail?u=i&sh=9uajfg) to its Alltrails map - 15 miles and 2,000 feet of climbing should make for a fairly spicy day!

As most of you know, I'm hosting these hikes and our Fieldwork meetups to help myself and others **make more hiking, backpacking, and friendy friends**. I hike several days a week in the central East Bay and I plan on doing several multi-day backpacking trips in the Sierras this summer. But that's just me! If you're vibing with someone and the feeling seems mutual, give them your number and plan something concrete! The worst that can happen is nothing, and that's already going on.

So. This hike is going to require some **serious planning**. Here's the deal:

- The trail itself starts at Sunrise Point in Candlestick Park, but we're going to meet at **Mission Blue Coffee** at 144 Leland in Visitacion Valley, [linked here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rEqhGp7M1uFSLxAq7). This cuts two miles and 45 minutes off the hike, but that's OK - the Candlestick section is pretty meh, and I can't figure out whether the Sunrise Point parking lot closes at 5 or 7 in the winter - the former's no good. Plus who can resist coffee in *rustic-chic environs*.

- The **group as a whole** will depart promptly at **10 AM** from Mission Blue. I don't check my phone once we're off, so if you're late use the map to catch up.

- If you **don't** need a car once we reach the end of the hike at Land's End - maybe you live nearby or plan on taking public transit, a gig, or a poltergeist car - feel free to arrive at Mission Blue by 10 AM however you see fit. Same deal if you're going to peel off before we reach the end.

- If you **do** need a car once we reach Land's End - maybe you're driving from elsewhere and don't feel like spending hours on public transit after a 15 mile walk and you find the gig and ghost economies existentially gross - we'll set up a **vehicle bridge**. We'll meet at the Land's End Lookout [linked here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wFpLqh8bJ3Q6emFp8) at **8:45 AM** and depart promptly at 9 for the 30 minute drive to Mission Blue, leaving behind enough cars at Land's End to drive **back** to Mission Blue once we finish the hike.

- I'll be Team Shuttle and can take up to four people in my crappy Prius C. Those of you with shameful hoarder cars should purge them now. Post-hike snacks and drinks would be wise too. As with all things SF, don't leave *anything* visible in your car - if you have a trunk, folding down the seats can help preserve your windows.

- Regardless of **where** we meet up, I'm still the middle-aged bald guy with black hiking poles and strong RBF.

If everything goes according to plan, we'll depart *en masse* from Mission Blue at 10 AM. At a normal walking pace with a reasonable number of bathroom, photo, stretching, coffee, pastry, and celebrity coyote breaks, I'd guess we'll make Land's End by 5 or so. Sunset's at 5:50, so we should finish well before dark. More points:

- Unlike our nature hikes, rain cancels - being moist all day sucks.

- Please bring a lunch - I don't want to deal with the chaos of stopping and ordering. That being said, I'd be grateful if our more food-motivated members would be willing to plan a few solid coffee / pastry / snack options along our route.

- If anyone wants to lead some or all of the hike, I'd appreciate it - navigating impairs my ability to yap. Unless there's a free Google Maps version, I have to think the paid Alltrails live directions are a must.

- We should have a big group, so if I could have a few volunteers share a sweeper position that would be rad - I don't want people getting left behind unless they deserve it.

- Dogs seem OK for this one, but I'm not certain about that. It's on you to assess the full route for permission and your pup's fitness!

- If I'm missing anything important about the logistics, parking, route, etc., let me know!

This being a human endeavor, we need some ground rules. Here are mine:

- **Be fit.** That word conjures unpleasant images of oppressively tan people in pastel spandex, but it does capture the immutable fact that this is going to be a hard hike. Please only attend if you can comfortably complete 15 miles and 2,000 feet of climbing at a normal walking pace on occasionally rough terrain with few breaks. That's like 5-7 hours of walking. Folks are welcome to join us for stages, but I'm too lazy to calculate where we'll be when.

- **Be cool.** Please only attend if you're looking to make platonic hiking, backpacking, and friendy friends - this isn't Tinder, LinkedIn, or any of the other dreary plagues afflicting our modern world. If you do fall in love, your firstborn must bear my name.

- **No complaining.** Sure, a little customary hiker grumbling is necessary and good, but please don't complain about things I told you would happen unless you're me. That being said, please **do** speak up if you're not feeling well or having genuine difficulty keeping up.

By attending, you agree to follow these and the world's rules and to maintain a friendly and welcoming vibe. Anyone who breaks these rules or otherwise shits the bed will get the boot. Also, please note that this hike is performed **entirely at your own risk**. SF weather, SF hills, SF drivers, SF coffee, SF bathrooms, SF coyotes, and more make this a risky event. By attending, you agree to fully assume any and all risks, damages, and liabilities you may incur and to hold me harmless for the same.

If you're planning on attending, please RSVP in the comments or via DM so I can get a rough headcount. Please also indicate whether you'll be Team Shuttle. Please don't RSVP unless you're **serious** about showing up - this is an excellent opportunity to eschew our region's famous waffles.

See you on Sunday the 16th!

The plan was to keep things casual—do some work, make light conversation, and ask for her number before leaving. But the shop was busy, and I felt like asking her in that setting might make her uncomfortable, so I didn’t say anything beyond ordering coffee.

I've always liked Blue Tokkai but its apparent that they are leaning towards scale and commercialisation now. Most large commercial coffee chains serve pretty average coffee (talking Starbucks etc).

The trend I've noticed in central Bangalore so far is that even specialty coffee stores need to deliver more than just quality coffee to survive i.e they almost have to serve food to make the business viable along with good aesthetics etc. This makes it a challenge to have a coffee centric focus.

I'm also uncertain what kind of demand there is for purist coffee experiences - would someone come to a store just for a good cup of coffee and nothing else? Considering that there are extreme nuances to coffee to add, would it be a tough sell to convince ordinaly people of the quality of the coffee at scale? Would love to listen to other perspectives on this.

I'd love to start something to serve high quality coffee at competitive prices. Just trying to understand if that's viable and/or other things to consider.

I'll go first,"I know we all have our daily ""wtf were they thinking moments"" but I am curious what others have had and how bad they are. Mine actually happened today. First a small backstory.

  
I came into my current role (shit fest) no P&P's no rhyme, reason, or systems in place. No backups, no recovery options no antivirus nothinggggg. Took a good 6 months to get things rolling and before, our policy (unwritten) was for people on their last day to fill out a check release form, this would come from Supervisor>IT>HR. Makes sense right? Supervisor in my opinion should be the person obtaining the tech from the user, turning into IT (me) I check equipment and sign off whether equipment is good or not. That's how it was always done.

Well things aren't exactly going smoothly or have been for awhile. I get back to the office this morning and my CFO hands me an iPhone and proceeds to question me why this was laying on a desk (user was canned but I was informed last minute and had NOT received the equipment yet) normally thats how it goes I get handed equipment either by the person or supervisor along with a form. 

I explain this to her and she's completely confused what I am even talking about with the check release form process. She seems a TAD heated (more so than normal) and begins to chastise me about maintaining company equipment and how important it is and how this is company money yada yada. I say sure got it and just nod my head. THEN not seconds after she goes ""Oh! Btw, this external portable monitor you gave me no longer works."" She pulls out a BLACK external USB-C Monitor. I immediately know this isn't ours for 2 reasons. 1. I put company asset tags on ALL equipment that could leave a desk. 2. Ours are different completely and not even the same color and recall that she bought one of her own. 

Without missing a beat she argues and says no this is for sure what I got, and I say no, pointing out the 2 reasons and then remind her that she bought it off Amazon, I even showed her the email with the link she sent to me of it asking if this was a good one, point to the back and say there's a LARGE asset tag that says company name XXXX.

Immediately she goes no no, I bought that for my son for christmas. Then it dawns on her, seconds after chastising me about maintaining company assets she realizes she just confessed to gifting her son company property. She's the CFO.....

I smile, and just grab my cup of coffee and say ""I'll make sure to update the spreadsheet that that equipment was ""lost"" unless she wanted me to mark otherwise.

The trend I've noticed in central Bangalore so far is that even specialty coffee stores need to deliver more than just quality coffee to survive i.e they almost have to serve food to make the business viable along with good aesthetics etc. This makes it a challenge to have a coffee centric focus.   
  
I'm also uncertain what kind of demand there is for purist coffee experiences - would someone come to a store just for a good cup of coffee and nothing else? Considering that there are extreme nuances to coffee to add, would it be a tough sell to convince ordinaly people of the quality of the coffee at scale? Would love to listen to other perspectives on this.

I'd love to start something to serve high quality coffee at competitive prices. Just trying to understand if that's viable and/or other things to consider. I'm also very aware that the traditional cafe space in Bangalore is quite saturated so this would need to be something considerably different.",2,1737559479.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False
1i7djhm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1i7djhm/how_long_should_i_take_probiotics_im_almost_out/,How long should I take probiotics? I'm almost out of a 100 count bottle.,"I developed a temporary IBS in October after food poisoning in August (ultrasound negative, stool/blood tests negative for anything). 

It's gotten a lot better, for example, I couldn't have a single drink but now I'm able to have a small one a night (like a Truly) and it just makes my stool soft rather than making me feel terrible and giving me straight-up diarrhea (I don't have 1 a night, still taking it as easy as possible).

My treatment has been a steady diet of foods that I've found to have been easy on me, and I've slowly been branching out. However, it is *not* over for sure. I know when I mess up, but luckily the days of liquid death and stomach cramps are over and it's just ~3-4 movements of small stool a day if something doesn't agree with me (although I admit my big trigger foods such as coffee or kale I have not tried again).

I started with a generic Walgreens bottle of probiotics (100 ct.), and I'm now down to 5. My question was if I should get more? Stop taking them after they're gone? Get a different brand/kind?

Thanks in advance!",2,1737559435.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

Having a very modest budget means that the tools that I bought for espresso were on the cheapest side available on Amazon.   
  
As I am now a year in, I think I might be ready for some minor upgrades and this df54 got the gears in my brain turning.  
  
I am currently using a no name 25 USD canonical burr grinder from Amazon bought during Thanksgiving sale in 2023.   
  
It has a small hopper and I use it for single doses. I spray some water on the beans to reduce static. If I put in 16.5 grams of whole beans in , with a few pats on top I get 16.5 grams out. Almost no retention.  
  
For double shot I grind at 10 and for single shot at about 4.. I am able to pull a double or a single shot within 25 to 30 seconds.  
  
The shot, depending on the coffee, has a nice balance of bitter versus sour once everything is dialed in.   
  
As much as I want a shiny new grinder, I am curious what benefit I would see.   
  
I make one espresso a day so a fast grinder isn't something that I need. I don't mind waiting 30 seconds for 16.5 grams.   
  
I am just trying the figure out the value add of a shiny new grinder.

1i7da8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Target/comments/1i7da8b/my_bad_experience_working_at_target/,My bad experience working at Target,"I previously worked at Target, specifically in the Starbucks Department. I’ve worked for over a dozen companies throughout my life with a variety of different job responsibilities and I have never had a work experience as horrible as my experience working at Target

I want to start by saying that I think Target is a probably a fine company and I’ve personally shopped there my entire life. I also worked at 2 different Target locations and I very much enjoyed working at the first one. I have no hate for Target as a whole, I think I just unfortunately had to work at a bad apple

The people there were horrible. They were very mean, inconsiderate, and unhelpful. Most people I work with are nothing like that. I’ve never worked with people like that. I had a co worker who laughed at another’s self harm scars, I had a coworker who got too high on his vape in the back room so he had to leave early because he was “feeling sick”, almost every shift I would be taking orders/making drinks with a line while my co workers are all in the back talking, leaving me by myself. Too them this behavior was normal. They couldn’t understand that most people didn’t act this way, that most people are more helpful and considerate towards others

But most of all, they were just mean mean people. They were bullies. They lacked any sort of empathy for others. I’m the kind of person who has a lot of empathy and I feel I care more than others, honestly to a fault, but these people only cared about themselves, they were mean people that were a nightmare to be around and I don’t feel that way about any one else I’ve ever worked with. It’s wasn’t as bad when I first started there but over time people left and the new people that joined or returned only turned the place into bad environment 

The places I’ve worked in the past and the few places I’ve worked at since then have all been good. I’ve liked my co workers and they’ve all really liked me. I mean most of my co workers really really like me it seems and that made me happy in the past and somewhat helps now. There are good people, most people are good, people at Scooters, local coffee shops I’ve worked at, my other coffee shop, Quiktrip, Best Buy, premium retail, grove, they were all good people that I had no issues with at all and they even really missed me when I left but this place was filled with the most horrible people I’ve ever met at Target. I don’t understand how people can be that way

I had one specific coworker who kept harassing me and bullying me. I thought this person was a friend, a friendship I valued, but then we had one conversation they didn’t like where I asked them to stop doing something and they completed turned on me and started treating me horribly

They decided in that moment they were going to do everything in their power to be as horrible towards me as possible and to make me miserable to make everyone there hate me. And they did. Before this I didn’t have any issues with anyone that worked there. Everyone there really liked me which was how it normally was. This one coworker made that place a nightmare for me and did everything they could to make everyone there hate me and to make me sad and feel bad about myself

I considered this person a work friend, someone I was always nice to and joking around with, someone I would’ve never treated the same, and they bullied me and harassed me and yelled at me and made mean comments towards me and spread lies about me for 6+ months and it destroyed me and my mental health

I tried asking for help from my co workers, I tried making complaints with hr and calling corporate but nothing helped, no one helped. I made the complaint because I just wanted to be left alone, I couldn’t take any more, but after they continued making comments and bullying me. There was nothing I could do so I had to quit even though I could barely pay my bills and really needed that job

A big part of the blame is management. Hr and my etl did nothing to help. They treated everything like it was a joke and were too laid back to a fault. My Starbucks manager was the same way. She could’ve helped me but never even once tried. And I thought she was a friend to but I was wrong to think that. I was the hardest worker there and my manager took advantage of that and used me to make her life easier but when I was being bullied and needed her help she did nothing to help me. She was too busy getting high to help me out even though the bullying was destroying my mental health she did nothing to help me or hr or the etl.

Luckily since leaving there I’ve worked at a few different locations with all great people who have been kind, considerate, hardworking, helpful and overall good people. I worked at Target for so long that I let those people convince me that there was something wrong with me, that I was the issue, and I let them drag me down. I know now that im a good people, most people I meet now or have met in the past really really like me and they’re always commenting on how helpful I am or how im their “bestie” or how it’s a pleasure working with me. It helps to be surrounded by good people because for a while I was surrounded by the meanest most inconsiderate people I’ve ever met and I let them convince me that there is something wrong with me but I know better now.

I just wanted to share my experience working here. It truly was the worst experience of my life having to be around those people which is why it still bothers me even now and why im making this post. I truly care about kindness and helping people more than anything and that shows from me everyday. Which is why the way the people here treated me and others bothers me the way it does. They were horrible people and it’s wrong to treat others that way. Bullying someone for 6+months with the intention of trying to make someone as sad and miserable as you can, not caring at all about how it affects that person or their well being and worst of all to act that way towards someone who was nothing but nice to you and just came to work and constantly joked around with you and tried to be a work friend. I don’t want to be friends with someone like that. I want nothing to do with people who treat others that way. 

That place and all the people there made me miserable and management did nothing to help. They ignored an employee getting bullied for 6 months and even encouraged the people there to act the way they did. I hope other people on here had better experiences working at Target. I hope these people I worked with one day understand how much the way they treated me hurt me then and still hurts me today. But those people will never understand just how badly it affected me. They bullied me and destroyed me life that I worked so hard for so long to build and they’re out there laughing not caring at all about the damage and pain they caused me

1i7d7l1,https://www.reddit.com/r/biggboss/comments/1i7d7l1/unpopular_opinion/,Unpopular Opinion,"People keep calling KV an underdog, but anyone with a 'TARGETED STORYLINE' but also NOT ISOLATED or intentionally sidelined, so like the dude had support of people from outside who came to guide him etc etc, I honestly predicted way in the beginning that he's meant to be in the top by default. 

A similar or a set story line was given to Avinash (targeted by HM, supported by CG, they added VV as a supporter of the targeted victim AV, although he like/ more than multiple others, just chose a side and conveniently sticked without actually caring about right and wrongs), and Rajat(victim of ruined reputation, but a smart, pookie person inside), Eisha (victim of being accused of doing chugli when everyone else does that) 
KV shilpa VV storyline was intentionally established with the TG task for honestly no absolute reason, they ran this plot for the entire season.

All these were established within the first few weeks and the script never ended. 


I have said this before and I'll say this again, BB has its set of finalists and filler contestants. Filler contestants are like NPCs. They are just there to elongate the season by taking the early evictions. 

Watching BB never felt like I was watching a reality show with abc number of contestants. It feels like squid game where we mostly see from the POV of the main 6-7 contestants among close to 500 contestants. Did we ever feel we were watching from Shrutika's or even Chum's perspective (I genuinely believe she got lucky by being chosen by KV as a romantic interest)? Edin? Shehzada, Kashish, Sara, Arfeen etc? 

It was always about KV, AV, Rajat, Eisha and Vivian. Shilpa was the next important side character with an important plot. Honestly the only underdog imo is Chum. 

But the real competition was always within the prior 5. 

I will not nitpick incidents because I feel the entire show was formatted that way, thoda zor lagao ge toh samajh aa jaega. These players were shown as victims at some point, except they were never the victim of the maker because even after some got the tougher battles, the real victims were targeted, but also sidelined and their parts were cut and noone was brought to motivate them time and again. Not one episode without the main ones even if it's the same old sipping coffee. 

Am I mad about KV winning? No. Out of the given 5, he did the most justice to the bias and opportunities imo, plus he is a typical extroverted social person. His social experiencs and skill would probably got him to the top even without the bias. But VV, Eisha? 

But I feel BB has its way to subtly manipulate the game while also heavily manipulating the game to the point we ask ourselves, are they not scared of the audience at all because how obvious it is? and while people are busy being mad at the more obvious bias, we are subtly manipulated to expect the competition between the selected few that BB wanted since day 1. 

Do we really believe that they didn't intentionally give each one a storyline to them relevant. They literally step in with 'very out of touch of public opinion'-wkv, unnecessary guest appearances to support/wake up one character alone, whether its bringing friends and families to confession room,  it's bringing celebrity guests in support, etc. Are other characters not expected to play? Why did they not get the push? Why didn't they stand anywhere in the storyline?

I try to go back to sleep but my body feels like it's buzzing so I can't. 

Also, I notice last night my heart rate was super high and I had shortness of breath, and chest pains. However, I realized it was most likely my acid reflux because I had a lot of coffee and too much coffee gives me acid reflux. Last time I was on Wellbutrin the reason I stopped taking it was because it exasperated my acid reflux. Apparently it's pretty common, my friend had the same problem. And acid reflux can cause all those symptoms. But I'm wondering if I possibly developed an allergy to welbutrin and if so, how do I know? 

My question is, if I take IR instead of XR, will that help my insomnia? And some people suggest taking it at night. Will that just help with people who have trouble falling asleep, or with people who have trouble staying asleep too? 
And if I stick it out, will the insomnia get better? Last time I was on it when I was a lot younger, I didn't have trouble with insomnia, I just remember I slept 8 hours instead of my usual 9 and I woke up rested.

No need to click link to GQ. No paywall. For those who couldn't access earlier. Copy pasted and then hightlighted questions by me )","# Kyle MacLachlan on Losing David Lynch, Their 40-Year Creative Partnership, and the Work They Never Got To Do

**By** [Paula Mejía](https://www.gq.com/contributor/paula-mejia)

  
Back in the early 1980s, a fresh-out-of-drama-school actor named [Kyle MacLachlan](https://www.gq.com/story/nobody-is-having-a-better-brat-summer-than-kyle-maclachlan) auditioned in Seattle for a buzzy adaptation of Frank Herbert’s sci-fi classic [*Dune*](https://www.gq.com/story/dune-franchise-david-lynch). This led to a meeting in Los Angeles with [David Lynch](https://www.gq.com/story/oral-history-of-david-lynch), then best known as the painter-turned-director behind the outré cult flick *Eraserhead* and the Oscar-nominated *The Elephant Man.* MacLachlan walked into a bungalow on the Universal Studios backlot prepared to talk in detail about *Dune,* a novel he happened to read cover to cover every year. But when he sat down in front of Lynch, their conversation didn’t talk about *Dune* at all. Instead, MacLachlan found himself talking about his childhood in Washington state, where the Missoula, Montana-born Lynch had also spent some time as a young man.

“We talked about growing up in the Pacific Northwest, what it was like to be outdoors as a kid all day, riding your bike around, hanging out, shooting BB guns at bottles,” MacLachlan tells *GQ*. “The things that you did during certain seasons in eastern Washington, in Montana. It’s all a very similar climate up there, and geography.” MacLachlan remembers that Lynch seemed less interested in evaluating his acting chops and more in establishing whether “a conduit \[existed\] between you somehow.” After that brief meeting, Lynch then asked MacLachlan to screen test for the role of Paul Atreides, *Dune*’s galactic-revolutionary protagonist. “From the meeting, he must have felt something,” MacLachlan recalls.

Although *Dune* was an infamous box-office flop when it was released in 1984, it marked the beginning of Lynch and MacLachlan’s decades-long friendship and extensive creative partnership. Their work spanned *Blue Velvet,* a twisted send-up of the rot lurking behind white picket fences; the defining (and delightfully strange) ’90s soap opera meets procedural *Twin Peaks*; as well as the show’s uncanny prequel film *Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me* and its eventual, safety-off 2017 reboot, [*Twin Peaks: The Return*](https://www.gq.com/story/david-lynch-twin-peaks-profile). MacLachlan — who, in his work with Lynch, often played clean-cut characters with sweet tooths and an innate goodness that occasionally curdled — gradually became so central to Lynch’s work that many people have seen him as an onscreen avatar for the director himself, who (like Agent Cooper) brimmed with hard-wired cheer, a penchant for black coffee, and a willingness to go to disquieting places in his art.

MacLachlan still seems awestruck that Lynch, [who died last week at the age of 78](https://www.gq.com/story/david-lynch-has-died), entrusted him with his wildly peculiar vision. “While the world has lost a remarkable artist, I’ve lost a dear friend who imagined a future for me and allowed me to travel in worlds I could never have conceived on my own,” MacLachlan [wrote in a moving tribute](https://www.instagram.com/kyle_maclachlan/p/DE5pC5RyH29/?img_index=1) to his late friend.

Much of that had to do with the joyous environment Lynch created on every project. “Part of the joy was going on that journey with him because it was like, we're following a path. We're way outside of normalcy here, you know?” MacLachlan laughs. “What a thing to be able to expand into that. Just, like, *No, let's go out there and see what happens*. What a gift. I think that's another reason why the people that worked with him were so moved and so changed.”

Over the weekend, MacLachlan spoke with *GQ* about his long friendship with Lynch, the secret language they together onset as creative collaborators, Lynch’s later feelings towards *Dune*, and what fueled Lynch’s unconventional art-making in our increasingly risk-averse world.

***GQ:*** **I was so sorry to hear about David. What have you been thinking about over the last few days since you learned that he’d passed?**

*Kyle MacLachlan*: There's been a definite magnetic pull that I felt between all of the collaborators, all the actors. [Laura Dern](https://www.gq.com/story/baby-yoda-laura-dern-basketball-game) and I have spoken many times. I've been in touch with Isabella \[Rossellini\] as well. I've been talking with some of the people that were closely connected with David, that were in his day to day. I feel like the wagons have been encircling the campfire, just so to speak, as we've all leaned on each other. We’re not at the point yet where we're sharing fun stories or stories of him that make us laugh. We're, right now, just grieving.

\[David and I\] live pretty close to each other. Part of me still imagines him at the house, puttering around, painting, doing his woodwork, his music. I know all the spaces, his creative spaces, and I just think he's there doing his thing. But then another part of me goes, *You're gonna go over there, Kyle, and you're not gonna \[hear\] that wonderful shout*, that he would do when he'd see me — ‘Kale!’ — *in that very particular voice*. And that's just never gonna happen again. That's when I think the finality of what's happened hits you with a thud. That's when the sadness comes.

It’s this back and forth. I think that's pretty common, having lost my mom, lost my dad. It's a similar thing. Part of you is like, “No, they're there, they're alive, they're doing their thing.” And part of you is like, “I am never going to hold them. I'm never going to talk with them. I'm never going to have a moment like that.” And that’s really hard for me. I think part of the way we keep them alive — my parents, certainly, and David as well — is when we talk with people who are also within the orbit. They share that. And then we talk about it, and we remember, and we smile and we laugh, and we have that warm feeling, Which I think helps. But it’s never the same.

**In the** [***New York Times*** **piece**](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/19/opinion/kyle-maclachlan-david-lynch.html) **you wrote about David, you mentioned that he distrusted words because of the finality that they had. That skepticism then made him develop a unique workaround for the way that he communicated on set with actors, a sort of secret language. Was there a time where you felt especially attuned to that shared language you shared together?**

It really started in *Blue Velvet*. That’s where I really remember it. I knew that these words were loaded. For David, they carried a lot of weight. They were important, the simple words: “The wind. Elvis. Mystery.” So I would just let them permeate, get into my body. And however that made me feel seemed to work for the scene, for the moment. I say that in the article that I didn't always know what was happening. Some of the scenes were more intuitive. They didn't necessarily make sense in a linear way. I recognized that there were scenes for the audience to experience, to go through with no real explanation, beginning, middle and end. It wasn't like that. I didn't know that intellectually or logically. I just felt it. And the more David and I worked together, the more it became more like, “okay, I get what's happening here.” He was creating at a whole other level. And I gradually met him in that place.

And so much joy, Paula. I mean, that's the one thing that I think all of the people that have worked with him can talk about, was just the atmosphere he created on set. The joy of creation. The encouragement to the actors to find their way through, in their own way, to this humanity. Not that he was saying, “You gotta do it this way.” It’s very unusual. And I think people that have worked with David will say: “I felt like I really contributed to something.” And as an actor, that's really all you're trying to do. You're just trying to make the story as great as it can be. He was that way in life. Of course, he touched so many people, and he really engaged and he wished for the best in you. It’s a rare quality.

**What do you think gave David the wherewithal to stick with his ideas and to try potentially out-there things, especially in such a risk-averse world?**

He's just a courageous artist. And it's a really good question, because I don't know if there was a moment in his life where he said “It's got to be this or not.” I know he's spoken about *Dune*—and *Dune* was, I think he felt in some ways, a compromise. I don't know if it happened then, or if it was a series of experiences that he had. But I think at some point I know he said, “I'm just gonna follow my creative intuition.” And that's not easy. You think about it as an artist — and using myself — I'm much more comfortable compromising, or perhaps questioning, my own instincts. And to a greater and lesser degree, I think all actors are like that. Some don't question at all. Some question everything. It was something that he just felt. As he grew, I think there was just no alternative in his mind.

I'm thinking back now to *Eraserhead*, which I think took him five years to make. He had a vision, and he was going to do it in a certain way. And if it took five years, it took five years. But everything in that film has come from inside of him. He felt like, “this is what I see, And it's different from what is in the world. It's different than what is expected.” To have the courage to be able to say, “Yes, but this is important to me.” I don't think he was saying, like, “Oh, this is important for the world to see this.” I don't think that was it at all. I think it was just, “This is what moves me. This is important to me, as one human’s experience.” And come to find out that many, many people are moved by what came from him. What a pure expression.

**Speaking of** ***Dune*****, my understanding is that due to forces perhaps outside of his control, that film was a creative heartbreak for David, especially with him not being able to do it the way that he envisioned. He always said he'd never go back and do a director's cut, but in recent years he seemed more open to that idea. Did you two ever talk about how he felt about** ***Dune,*** **or how his thinking about it evolved over time?**

It’s interesting. Not a shred of: “This is difficult for me,” or “I'm struggling.” I never saw that. I just saw the positivity: “We’re making the movie and we're going to do it this way.” He certainly kept that from me. I never saw a person who was being tortured. Later, I discovered that he was very unhappy with it, and took his name off it. And I think it felt like he hadn't really done what he wanted to do. More recently, I think the public really helped him to maybe rethink the film. There was an embracing of the film—recognizing, of course, that it's flawed and difficult and very difficult to follow. But still, so many people loved the film, and loved the journey, and loved being in the world that he created in *Dune*, that I think he began to think, “Maybe there's a way to revisit it.” I don't know if he ever was going to, but I know that he started to just entertain the idea. And, of course, now we'll never know.

**You wrote in your** [**tribute to David**](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/19/opinion/kyle-maclachlan-david-lynch.html) **that you and him had a vaguely similar look, comparable childhoods, Pacific Northwest roots, and so he found it natural to channel ideas through you. Do you feel like you were a surrogate or alter ego for David on screen? I'm thinking specifically of Agent Dale Cooper in** ***Twin Peaks*** **loving coffee, mystic exploration, interpreting dreams. And in** ***Blue Velvet,*** **too, you play this all-American boy who's drawn to darkness, Jeffrey Beaumont.**

This is just coming from me, this is just my sort of thinking about it. I believe he felt comfortable with me sort of carrying some of the elements, some of the feelings of himself, through these worlds. I do believe that these worlds—the world of *Twin Peaks*, the world of *Blue Velvet* in particular—are very important for David. They’re very real. He feels these worlds, and he can create in these worlds. I think it's one of the reasons why he became Gordon Cole in *Twin Peaks*, because he loved the world so much. He wanted to live in that space along with us.

I also think there was an innocence or a naïveté or goodness maybe that is in me, and that I think he really liked somehow. And I think he felt, “Oh, that's a good quality—that's a good energy to carry through some of these very dark stories.” It was a quality that in my youth, I didn't want that to be part of who it was. I tried to try to reject that and move away from that. And as I've gotten older, I've realized, “No, that's actually one of my strengths.” I'm not trying to pretend I'm this way. I just *am* this way. And those qualities come out in the films. I mean, certainly with *Blue Velvet*—and maybe it gets corrupted a little bit. I would say Jeffrey was singed with the fire. And then with Cooper, it was the same thing: He had this open heart to the world. But along with that he was also aware of pure evil, and he was able to override that and endure it. Or not let it overwhelm him.

**Laura Dern** [**once said**](https://www.instagram.com/p/DE8O3nnx6K1/?hl=en&img_index=1) **that Jeffrey Beaumont’s “Why is there so much trouble in this world?” monologue in** ***Blue Velvet*** **is the clearest expression of where David was coming from. Does that resonate with you?**

Guillermo del Toro, someone told him, when he met David: “David is not ironic. He's not ironic. He feels these things.” So Jeffrey is not judging it or commenting on it. He’s really asking the question in kind of a desperate, emotional way. It’s like, “Why?” In some ways, it felt overwrought in the moment. But it’s very real, and so that's how we played it. And I don't think there ever was a question of doing it any other way. \[David\] was just, like, *We are asking these simple questions in a very honest way*. On one one part, it's funny, and on the other part it’s like, *Yeah, why is that? Why does it have to be that way*?

***Twin Peaks*** **was a huge hit and then cratered in season two, after Lynch left and after ABC pushed to have him reveal the identity of Laura Palmer’s killer. Do you think he was disappointed about losing the audience then?**

I think it was more about the politics of television at the time, of series television, and of the expectations. I don't know if he really knew going in, honestly, what could happen. I know it was a challenging time. I mean, that pilot is still incredibly powerful, and those first seven episodes. But I think that he realized that he just wasn’t able to do everything that he needed to do within that medium. I think he just accepted it. I think he recognized that *Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me* was his opportunity to take *Twin Peaks* and make it what he was attempting to do. And then, even more so, *Twin Peaks: The Return* was pure David.

**Correct me if I'm wrong, but I’ve read that you were the only actor in** ***The Return*** **who was allowed to read all the pages for the show, and only in this secretive room?**

The script was not to leave the confines of the little production office set up. So I read the entire script there in one sitting. I don't know if I was the only actor to read it. Maybe Naomi \[Watts\] had an opportunity, or Laura \[Dern\]. I have just a flash of memory of getting up in LA, my home, in the morning, like at four or 4:30 in the morning, coming to the kitchen, making a cup of coffee. Couple cups of coffee, actually. And just thinking to myself, “I have such tremendous gratitude. I get to go today to work with my dear friend, in a series that changed my life, with a character that is beloved, and other characters—I get to go outside of just Dale Cooper—with one of the greatest directors who've ever lived?” It was a joyful working experience. Even, you know, late nights covered in blood, being massaged by large bearded men, lying on the cold ground. I'm like, “I'm so happy to be here.”

**David was an artist with a strong vision, but especially on** ***Twin Peaks*****, I know there were scenes that were perhaps rewritten or storylines based on your input. How do you think David thought about characters, and what it was like for you to approach him and say something like, “I don't think Agent Cooper would do it that way?**”

Once the actor starts to inhabit the character, they honestly begin to understand the character, I think, better than anybody you know. And David was completely, like, “Okay, let's explore that.” He never really shut me down. Cooper was…there were some things that I wanted to try and they were open to it. There definitely was a sense of collaboration, particularly in *The Return*, that was the two of us working together really closely to develop and make specific the three main characters. We worked really closely and intuitively and gently and kind of slowly on creating those three characters. That was a really magical thing. We didn't take a step until we felt it was in the right direction. It’s like putting your foot out there into the dark and kind of feeling around a little bit, and then saying, “Okay, I think we're going to step here.”

**Is there a specific lesson David imparted on you about creativity that you've applied to your own life?**

Never said, but watched and intuited and read in his book. And just listened to his stories. And he's so much braver than I am, so much more courageous than I in terms of his belief in his process. Every day was a creative day in David's universe. And I sort of feel like he was as happy doing the weather and doing that persona and talking as he was working on a film. He just loved the creative process so much.

It’s inspirational. I am aspirational. I aspire to be more like that. [In the article](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/19/opinion/kyle-maclachlan-david-lynch.html) I mentioned that I would feel someone would ask him a question, and he would not necessarily answer, I would feel compelled to try to answer something. That’s my nature. I want to answer the question. I want to make the person happy. I want to resolve the problem. I don't like to sit in a place of discomfort. And I don't know if David necessarily liked to sit in a place of discomfort, either. But not responding, or responding in his own way, was the only way he knew. It’s all about not explaining the work. The work is the work, right? You have the experience, and then maybe you tell me what you took away from it.

**Was there a particular performance of yours or character that David complimented you on outside of your work with him? Like, do you think he ever saw** ***Showgirls*** **or** ***Sex in the City*****?**

*\[Laughs\]* I don't think so.

**What’s the most memorable dinner you had with David?**

We had a party here at my house a few years ago. It was pre-COVID, and it was a birthday party for me, actually, and I invited a lot of my friends. I invited David, and I said, “He doesn't really like to go out that much, but, well, maybe he'll come.” And he was the first to arrive, and he brought a bottle of wine. He came in, and he sat kind of on the little back porch here. And as people came and arrived, I thought, “Maybe he'll be annoyed or bothered.” And he was like, *so happy*, Paula. Some people didn't even know who he was, and he would just talk and enjoy it. He said, “That was the most fun I've had in so long.” He was just communing with people, having a glass of red wine, enjoying an evening. It was such a wonderful night. I always feel like I'm somewhat protective of David. I don't want him to feel uncomfortable. I want him to always be taken care of. And in this case, he came and he just was *so* happy. And it made me so happy.

**I realize this might be a difficult question, but I was wondering if you could tell me about the last time you saw David?**

Not difficult at all. \[It was\] probably sometime in September, maybe October, it was warmer. He would see people on his sort of back terrace. It's more of a patio, really, which was outside because he had a lung condition and wanted to be in the fresh air. Laura Dern and I had come for a visit. He loved the croissants and the pain au chocolats, actually, from Porto’s. So I got everything, I brought it back to the house. And he was so happy to see us together, and we spent three hours just talking.

Laura knows him in a different way. I mean, it’s David, but she has a very specific relationship with him. I have a very specific relationship with him. So we get to experience each other's connection with David, which is really fun and interesting, how they relate and the kind of banter they have. And David *loved* that. He loved conversation and teasing, oh my god. And we just sat and we just talked about stuff: what's going on in the world, what's happening. Some of the memories of *Twin Peaks: The Return*, some of the memories of *Blue Velvet*, and just sat and laughed and drank coffee and had croissants and pain au chocolats from Porto’s.

**I know that he had been dealing with serious health issues for a while. Had you been coming to terms with that when you saw him last, or did it feel like goodbye in a way? He seemed like he was in great spirits.**

When I heard it was just such an abrupt shock. Because he was in great spirits. He was quite upfront with saying, “It’s challenging, I can't catch my breath. I can't walk a great distance. I gotta pause.” But there was no like, “Well, this is the last time I'm gonna see you.” Nothing like that. It was like, “We got work to do! What's the next thing that we're gonna do?” He said, “I can direct remotely,” and we were talking about ideas. It was like, “What’s next?” In fact, Laura and I were planning another visit. And then suddenly, poof, he's gone.

**You’ve referred to David in the present tense a few times. It reminded me of that** [**beautiful interview David did**](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20230525-david-lynch-interview-how-the-mulholland-drive-director-worked-with-composer-angelo-badalamenti)**, where he referred to Angelo Badalamenti in the present tense after Angelo had died, and how it tied into his belief that life exists on a continuum.**

The finality is the hard part. Part of me is like, “David is there.” He's so strong in my mind and in my memory, and he's such a vivid person. He's so present. He's always been. He was always so present, that to think that he's not present now is just not possible yet. It’s not possible.",17,1737558210.0,twinpeaks,1,1.0,False

I made a separate post detailing the day of surgery! 

Day 0 + Day 1: These were definitely my worst days. I feel like I got a little bit more pain than a lot of stories I read on here, but even still my pain topped out at around a 6/10. I struggled the most with standing up from sitting/laying, the first few steps whenever I got up, and bending over. The worst part of this whole experience was not being given stronger pain medications. I was prescribed a higher dose of ibuprofen and otc tylenol. Even after crying to get out of bed the first night, I was only instructed to increase the ibuprofen. I would have certainly made a bigger fuss about it, but by Day 2 my pain was already down to about a 4. At this point I am taking Ibuprofen and Tylenol staggered 3 hours apart and truly felt like I was eating pills just to keep the pain down.

Day 2: I was already feeling much better. I even ventured out to get a coffee and took my dog on a walk around the block. Still felt very fatigued. 

Day 3: I had to go into work as I am the only one who works on Saturday, but I got to mostly just be at my desk. I do felt like I over did it a little bit so by the end of the day I was exhausted and feeling a little bit of pain again. Stupidly, I was trying to decrease my pain medication this same day, so only took the ibuprofen, but ended up taking tylenol as well once I was home. 

Day 4 + 5: I felt a drastic improvement in pain and mobility. Pain was sitting around a 2 or 3, much easier to stand-up from sitting or laying. I only took 3 ibuprofen all day and no tylenol. I could bend down to grab things if needed, but still could not be in a prolonged bend (like for tying shoes). My energy levels also seemed increased. I ran all my errands both days without a problem! Only took ibuprofen every 6 hours! 

Day 6: I’m back at work. Thankfully getting to be at my desk for a majority of the day. I did have to clean and organize a storage room and that took it out of me and made my pain spike just a little bit so I took an ibuprofen. 

Day 7 (Today!): At work again. Feeling pretty good! Pain is at a 1 or 2. Trying to phase out the pain meds, but have them handy if needed! I am still sleeping mostly up-right, but I feel like I am SO close to being able to sleep normal and on my sides again! ",1,1737558122.0,sterilization,0,1.0,False

I wanna share my experience, and see if people agree with me. Have tried to explain this to other poeple, but they don't seem to get me. I'm autistic, so maybe I'm missing something here. Feel free to give objections bellow.

As soemoene who tends to be more introvert, I obviously have the bias of not really liking phone calls in the first place. I tend to not pick up the phone when I see someone calling, even if they're a good friend. Still though, I think there are reasons to despise phone calls, also if you are more extraverted. Even on my more ""extraverted hours"" of the day (right after drinking coffee or something), I still feel like there's something deeply irrational about it. 

Let's talk math. There are 1440 minutes in a day, assuming a failed phone call lakes a minute or two, you have to assume that the person you're trying to reach is available to talk to in exactly that 1-2/1440 minutes of the day.  And it's not only about just having a fully charged phone in your hands at that moment (reasonable assumption), either. People in my life complain that I don't pick up the phone. Like, don't people understand that I'm at the gym, at the library, at the lecture hall, at work, or transitting, for so many hours of my day? Do y'all just sitt inside your room and smoke weed 24/7? Maybe having a personal work office, or straight up being unemployed clouds people's perspective?

It's not even that I suck at taking the phone, I also just feel like calling someone is so inaccessible for most of my day. Unless I'm somewhere quiet where I can talk outloud (in nature, in my bedroom, or something), calling someone is also so inconvenient to me. 

I've tried to tell so many people that I prefer texting/snapping/emails, etc. but they don't seem to listen. Even in my professional/academic life, so many people seem hellbent on calling me. 

Feel like the only contexts where it makes sense, is if I'm currently chatting back and forth with someone while laying down or walking outside in a quiet area, and we both agree to facetime/call. In that case, it makes sense, to sort of ""elevate the spirit of the conversation"". ... But just calling out of nowhere, assuming that folks with studies, jobs, families,  etc. are always available, is so strange to me. Just text! 

It ESPECIALLY anoys me when someone calls me several times, without leaving a text. If you try to reach me for something urgent, that's fine, but at least send a text (or voicemail) if I don't pick it up. 

Some folks have told me that they call because they're always out driving, and can't text me. Fine, but why wouldn't you just send a voicemail? It should take just as much time/focus to find my name in the phone list and hit call, as it does finding my name on snapchat and hitting the audio message option. It's a really bad excuse.

1i7czhx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Genealogy/comments/1i7czhx/new_identities_grab_a_cup_if_coffee_this_is_a/,"New Identities ..(Grab a cup if coffee, this is a long one)","My Grandfather Frank J. Ernst and brother Joseph F. Ernst – both born (Stvarnik) Joseph born on March 15, 1902 and Frank on August 2, 1907 in Slovenia and Immigrated with their family in 1908, settling in Milwaukee, WI.

 Once young adults around 1920 Joseph and my grandfather began going by the last name of Ernst. (Picked a name out of the air or a man they sat next to on a train? Who knows) The story goes they changed it because their father took his own life (which he did in 1916 )

My grandfather - Frank would eventually marry my Grandmother (Anna) in 1930 in Minnesota under this new “Ernst” name. Of this marriage was born my Father and his twin brother who were born under the name Ernst and lived out their lives under that name. My father and his brother never “knew” who their father was other than a man’s name on a birth certificate called “Frank Ernst” who said he was born in Milwaukee. Anna Eventually divorced this “Frank Ernst” in 1935, claiming he abandoned them in Jan 1932 and the twins were born in May of 1932. (In years of research long after my father passed to know who his father was – I found out who this Frank Ernst really was, sort of…)

When Frank Ernst attempted Citizenship in the 1940’s in Michigan, there is a section where one can request that their name to legally changed in this process to a different one and my grandfather requested the change from Frank J. Stvarnik to Frank J. Ernst. Ultimately, the request for citizenship and name change was denied due to “lack of good character witness”. He made this citizenship attempt twice and was denied both times, for same reasons and finally reverted back to his birth last name of Stvarnik and lived out his life in Michigan under that name.

 I have been researching where my grandfather and his brother were between the time they went by their birth last name of Stvarnik in Milwaukee and going by Ernst.

 Frank is a black hole between late 1920 (living in a boys school) and 1940 (other than marriage 1930 and divorce 1935) no record of him in the 1930 census, thus far, and when I find him in Michigan in 1940 Census under the name of Ernst claiming to have been born in Wisconsin ( as he had on his marriage record in MN ) and living there until his death under Stvarnik.

 Frank’s brother Joseph Ernst, never went back to Stvarnik – he remained an Ernst his entire life. You have to ask, how does an Immigrant without Naturalization papers, pick a new name, join the service, marry and live out as a different person?

 Based on Joseph’s family – Joseph left Milwaukee when he joined the Army (stationed in Colorado and Wyoming) – The last Census record I show of him (as a Stvarnik) in Milwaukee was 1920. - 

So I did some sleuthing…..

 Between January and February of 1920, A Michael J. Joyce applied and was approved as Legal Guardian for Minors wanting to join the Army in Colorado. One of those minors was **Joseph F. Ernst Born March 15, 1900 NOT 1902** (it is clear Joseph was attempting to join the Army under age as well )–. Joseph was claiming he was a minor and wanted to join the army and had no estate or family.

Joseph Ernst was not the only individual this Michael Joyce did this for. I have found 2 others around same time period. Joseph’s was Feb 19,1920 and the other two were Jan 24 and Feb 16, 1920. All of these were before the same Judge an “Ira Rothberger”. However, it should be noted that these are a set of records for only “Probate Court” in Colorado and it is unclear if this set of records is from one Judge (Ira Rotherberger’ Court) or if this is a set of all Colorado Probate records, but (Judge Ira Rothberger handled all probate cases), either could be true.

In either case, this Judge Ira Rotherberg would have to have been familiar with this Michael J. Joyce petitioning the court for guardianship of a minor to join the army as he had done it before in a relatively short period of time. It is my position that this individual (Michael J. Joyce) was probably a “recruiter” who found a work-around for enlisting under aged males claiming that they have “no estate and no family”. This action, by allowing a 3^(rd) party to become Joseph’s Guardian allowed him to solidify his new identity as “Joseph Fredrick Ernst”, as prior to this court action, Joseph had no proof of identity as an Ernst. Consequently, by entering the Military he further solidified this new identity as a man who went by Ernst and was born in Colorado, thus eliminating the need for Citizenship documentation for the remainder of his life. (census records going forward from this point show colorado as place of birth for Joseph)

 Frank and Joseph were known to travel between living in Milwaukee and Minnesota.

Joseph lived out his life in St. Paul, MN and Duluth, MN – where Frank married and divorced in MN as well has his children having been born there.

 Frank and Joseph had to have been close at one time to both go by Ernst at the same time, however in the late 30’s to early 40’s these brothers no longer made contact, nor did my grandfather with any of his other siblings.  Something happened in the 1930’s. It is understood that Frank did some Prison/Jail time at some point – however exactly when/where is unknown.  There are secrets here to be found and I am at a loss at this point in unique records to search for these answers.

 This is probably an incomprehensible string of ramblings that make no linear sense.

I am open to any ideas, thoughts,  Explanations, direction. Maybe just a sounding board.

Any Ancestry/Family search tree data, etc… Is all from me, these men did not exist until I began my research.

I'm a psychology graduate who loves art, music, and movies. I mostly listen to rnb, but i love listening and exploring to other genres as well. I've attended some jazz gigs but never been to a concert. I love making playlists on spotify. 

Currently i'm binging the show The Office US. It's becoming a comfort show for me. Other movies, I love LOTR, The Hobbit. 

I also like to travel and cafe-hopping. I love my coffee black, strong, and fruity.

1i7cwm3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i7cwm3,Dyed Fox Skull- Before & After,"I made a mixture of very strong black tea and espresso, dipped once for 1 hour and let dry, dipped again for 1 hour and let dry, and finally let sit for around 5 hours and left it to dry overnight. The result!!

My reasoning for the mixture and not letting sit submerged overnight is that I find teas to be a bit too weak and coffees to be too uniform in the staining process. I wanted a worn, natural, just found it in the woods look while keeping it sanitary. I dipped once to test, twice to make a layered look, and a third time to really get the overall piece done. 

WHAT I WOULD DO DIFFERENT: I experimented with gluing the jaw first and posing, but I found that where any glue spilled over, the stain didn't take. We live and learn! It does however give me an idea on brushing on adhesive (in this case, super glue) in a pattern and then trying the stain again with a other piece for a nicely constrated pattern.

1i7cvt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CBSE/comments/1i7cvt5/tips_for_you_juniors_of_class_10th/,Tips for you juniors of class 10th,"Hey guys I hope you all are doing good. I completed my class 12th in session 2021-2022. I given two board exams, Term 1 and Term 2 which were MCQ based and subjective respectively. Overall I got 95% in best of 5. I scored 100 out of hundred in English and social studies. In this post I will give you some tips about these two subjects mainly and also about mathematics and Science.

For English 
NCERT is your Bible. You don't need to have reference books for English. Particularly for literature. Read all the stories that are there in both the books at least three times if you are aiming for a high score in English. In poems pay special attention to figure of speech and the theme of the poem and how you express it. For stories, I have noticed it from my practice during that time, that class 10th questions of English is mainly factual with very little need of abstract writing unlike class 12th which is purely abstract. So try to memorize details that are given in the chapters and add those details in your answers so that the examiner know that you are well versed with your book. For example in the chapter that was related to the bus ride of Valli, memorize the rate of bus fare, and other details. Similarly in the chapter that was about Goa and Kodagu, learn about the types of breads the routine of the narrator in the Goa episode and about the plant and animal species that are found in Kodagu and also a bit of their history. In English you get marks for mainly two things first is how you insert the details and facts and second is about how you write about the Abstract of the whole question. For example if a question would be asked about Kodagu I will tell them about the history the details and then I will write about the Abstract of the episode, things that are not about details (aroma of coffee and beauty of the place etc). Practice NCERT questions really well and previous year questions. These two will be more than enough. 
2) *for the reading part* that is the comprehension, first read the questions please. Never read the paragraph in the starting start with the questions because sometimes in the factual passage the questions are very direct. For example on a passage that is related to the tiger population in India the questions will mainly based on figures and data for that you need not to read the whole passage but you just need to trace that particular data from the passage and that will save your time. I have cleared law examination for undergraduate in India with an all India rank 1233 and CUET with 186/200 in English and beleive me this method of reading questions first always work. You guys know jata you are looking for so u don't waste your time in reading the whole thing. Only when the question is about abstract things that don't involve facts and figures, you need to read the passage. Try to solve as many comprehensions as you can before going to the examinations. I will again say to go with previous year questions because they are enough. 
3) *for the writing part* I don't remember the syllabus exactly. When you get a choice between writing a formal or an informal letter please always choose the formal letter one because you have to write less content for that so there is less scope for mistake. Yes the format is long but you can memorize it within 5 minutes. When you are writing about analytical paragraphs don't insert your own opinions everywhere. Though, I will suggest you to give your point of view about the matter fact but in a very precise way preferably in one or two lines. Suppose the analytical paragraph is about tiger population in India so don't go on writing a whole rant about the population is so low etc etc. instead be very logical with your approach first write the data. For example the tiger population is 630 in state of Uttar Pradesh then you will write ""this shows that the population of tigers in Uttar Pradesh state is lesser than the neighbouring state of Madhya Pradesh because of various factors revolving around ecological conditions and government conservation programs"". This is how you will put your opinion very professionally and logically. For the grammar part I will suggest you to read class 8 book of grammar If you can get it from anywhere that will help you a lot. Again saying previous year questions are the treasures they will help you more than any YouTube wale bhaiya didi will do. Don't go on solving multiple books if you don't have time. First focus on accuracy and then focus on timing. 

At the end I will tell you all or advice you all to attempt the paper in C,A,B format. That is literature first comprehension second and writing part at the last. Literature section requires you to think to recall and to write for which you need a fresh mind. In comprehension you have to flip Your pages a lot that costs you time so save it for later start with literature part with a fresh mind you will finish it within 45 to 60mins. Your comprehension part will be over in 30 minutes and the writing part will be over in not more than 45 minutes. Best of luck guys.

1i7ctya,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i7ctya,4000 Hole Titanium Kickstarter Basket is here,"Hi my name is u/kichigax and I’m a serial coffee Kickstarter backer. 

First up, beautiful packaging. Comes in actual tins that can be repurposed for storage. Beans? Filter papers? Even comes with two extra portafilter springs.

The baskets themselves. Super lightweight since it’s full titanium and not just a coating like Normcore’s. Love the freckled finishing. 

I got the Accuracy basket, which supposedly has 4000 holes, making it the highest hole count basket I have. Flair’s HU is 1800 and Mischief Spirit is 3000 holes. Now, just cause it’s a high hole count doesn’t immediately make it good. My go to basket is Still the Pullman 876 after acquiring so many different baskets. I just like to try stuff. Also curious how Titanium will hold up under pressure. 

The other basket is the Swirl basket that was an add on. It looked interesting not just in terms of pattern, but hole size as well. Felt very dynamic and something that might actually change extraction noticeably rather than just more/less uniform holes. 

I did not get the 2000 hole version as I did not think it would be much different from everything I already have right now.

1i7cqb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1i7cqb6/im_official_done_being_generous_with_my_time_and/,I'm official done being generous with my time and charitable.   People don't appreciate it.,"In the past three years, my GF and I have been pretty charitable with some of the extra cash we have.   We've also gone out of our way to help others who have reached out asking for help.   My girlfriend has a particular skillset as an artist/graphic designer/web developer and I work as Project Manager and I'm fairly good at networking, so we are able to assist and help people with a few things.   People seem to trust us.  
  
We don't donate life changing money, and in addition we don't expect anything in return, but I've noticed a big trend towards people not being grateful for anything.   Some examples:

Story 1:  My girlfriend has a friend who wanted to started a business, so my girlfriend helped set up her website and designed a set of 10 different logos for her, set up all the SEO and even tested the site for User Experience feedback using her own resources.   Just way above and beyond what you would normally do.   My girlfriend didn't get compensated for it, but shockingly did not even get a ""thank you"".   The website and logo are being used today.    Shame on us for not drafting a ""pay before your play"" contract...but we expect friends to be better than this.

Story 2: The company I work for had a program where they were going to gift a local business $10K.  It was a coffee shop and the owners both knew us fairly well.   I filled out a bunch of application paperwork for this $10K gift and the coffee shop ended up winning.  Our company rep notified them that I was the individual who nominated them.  Our next three times in the coffee shop, the owner said absolutely nothing to us.  Zero.  It would have taken him a good minute to sit at our table and say ""thanks"".   He even has my number/email, so a simple text would have been fine.   

Story 3: The last thing doesn't even have to do with us, but rather a friend.   A guy I know needed 3D renders done for a home addition.   I have a friend who is a 3D artist who agreed to help out, so I connected them.   My friend completed these beautiful renders for a measly $400.  This time, no ""thank you"" either and the guy refuses to pay him, no matter how many emails or texts he sends.  $400 is that bad middle ground...not enough to go over court over but enough money to very useful for many things. 

I'm still OK donating to big non-profits and charitable things where I'm not expecting anything in return.   But it is sadly frustrating to know that common courtesy is just absolutely dead even with people you actually know.   People expect the world for so little in return.   I do my part to help others.   I don't expect to be repaid, but I do expect a simple two words:  ""thank you"".   Apparently, we can't do that now.

I ended up asking her out to coffee over text to which she agreed. I was through the roof and over the moon excited. Over a couple days we chatted and made set plans. The whole week leading up to it I was in the best mood I’d been in for a long time. It was a good distraction to daydream about while I’m at work and to get me through the week. It felt good that I put myself out there and even better that this girl I’d been crushing on was interested back. 

Then the night before she texted me asking to reschedule. My heart sunk. Of course, it’s not a big deal but I just had a bad feeling about it. I texted her the next morning saying it was no problem and asked about rescheduling. That was Sunday morning, it’s now Wednesday morning and I haven’t gotten a response. 

I will say that she often goes between responding immediately to me or not for days at a time. I’ve gotten better at not being worried when she isn’t responding because in the past she always ends up responding and continues convo well, but right now I just feel a huge overwhelming anxiety for the last day or so. 

I’m usually a confident person and don’t feel like this but when it comes to someone I have feelings for I can get obsessive. It’s something I improved upon on the past but now it feels like I’ve made a reset and I’m somewhat struggling right now.

I’ve always been a big overthinker. I think of every best case scenario, every worst case, and all them in between. I tried to remedy this by asking my friends their takes on the situation but they all had different takes. That makes me very anxious because I have no idea which one to believe. 

I guess unknowns have always made me unusually anxious. There’s a lot of unknowns here. Did she ever intend on meeting up? Is she stringing me along for fun? Does she like me and is just busy, am I blowing this out of proportion? Does she think I’m being clingy and wants me to leave her alone? Is there another guy and I’m the backup? Why did she ask to reschedule? Will she ever respond?

   June 17th, 1997 at 5:46am was the worst day of my entire life.

My name is Alex Torland, I was in prison for 26 years for having a simple dream that saved my life but it didn’t save my families life. June 17th, 1997 at 5:38 am, I woke up from a dream and started screaming. I remember every detail of the dream, including where I was, where my brother and sister was and even our pet dog yogi. I rushed out of bed and started banging on the doors of my mom and dad and my siblings rooms. They came out worried about what was going on, I was frantic and couldn’t get a single word out. Finally after 2 minutes, I screamed….

“WE NEED TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW!”

They all looked at me like I was insane, I started pleading for them to believe me, but they didn’t. It just hit 5:42am and I knew we only had 4 minutes left. You would think that would be plenty of time, but for trying to explain that everyone was gonna die, it’s definitely not enough time. A single tear flowed down my cheek and I knew at that very second, my family was gonna die. My siblings went back into their rooms and my parents were just shaking their heads.

I can’t even blame them either, I’ve always had a wild imagination, I also had a history of lying. It’s all my fault. “I’m so sorry” I said. Those were the last words I ever told my family. I looked at the clock on the wall and saw that it was 5:45. I had 1 minute and ran as fast as I could to the front door knowing the seconds were ticking down. I ran across the street screaming for help. It was like slow motion, I looked up at the right window and saw my older sister with a confused look and then…..it was gone.


I woke up probably like a minute later on the ground, my ears ringing, looked up and my entire house was in flames and gone. It took exactly 7 minutes and 24 seconds for the police, firetrucks, and the ambulances to show up. I tried running up to the house, but I was stopped by the police before I could. I turned around and punched the officer in the face that was trying to stop me. I started running again and I was tackled and handcuffed before I could.

I started screaming for my mom and dad, but my screaming fell on deaf ears. They put out the fire and the only thing left remaining was the ashes of my home and my family. I was taken down to the police station for questioning about the events that took place. 

As soon as I sat down in the interrogation room, I didn’t cry or scream, I just sat there in shock wondering if I was still dreaming. I looked down at my arm and pinched myself, the moment I felt the pinch was the moment I felt my whole world crash down onto me. The lead detective came in as I had my head down and I was crying. He brought me a coffee and a sandwich, I guess this was his way to be the nice cop. Only if I knew about having rights or even for the fact I was the main suspect for an unforgivable crime I didn’t commit. 

“So Mr. Torland, is it ok if I call you Alex or should I call you Alexander?” He said. My eyes were empty, my body felt of just pure emptiness and I didn’t even respond. 

“Look, we need to talk about what happened tonight, because right now you’re being charged with an a*sault on a police officer and four 1st degree m*rder charges.” He said. 

This is when I looked up for the first time and I was back in my body. I took the coffee and threw it onto him burning his face and 3 officers ran in and pinned me down and put me in handcuffs. I started screaming for my mom which is something I haven’t done since I was 6. I was 15 at the time, I’m now 43 years old and I remember that scream like it was yesterday. I was taken to a jail cell and left there for 3 days, I was called every name in the book by the guards. I could hear the radio in the other room and was being called a monster for something I didn’t do.

Finally they took me out of the jail cell and into the interrogation room again, a different officer walked in. “Hey Alex, I’m detective Lennon, let me go ahead and read you your rights before we start talking.” He says. 

There was only one thing on my mind and I finally spoke up. “Are they d*ad?” I said as I’m still looking down at the metal table as I can my reflection. 
“Unfortunately yes, your entire family is dec*ased” he says. He reads me my rights. 

“So, at this time, you’re being charged with both a*saults on the police officers and for the 4 h*mic*des. That’s including your mother Patricia, your father Paul, your sister Lucy, and your brother Eric. Do you understand what I’m telling you?” 

I looked up at him. “I didn’t k*ll them” I said and then put my head back down. He looked at me and said straight to my face,

“Look, we both know you k*lled your family, and we both know that you’re just gonna have to accept this reality. There was an explosive device found in the basement and you’re the only one that’s still alive. The sooner you come to terms with that, the sooner we can get this difficult part over with. Your family is d*ad, you happened to run out of your house exactly 1 minute before the b*mb went off. Now how did you know the bomb was gonna go off if you didn’t have any part in this?” 

I looked up at him with tears rolling down my cheeks. “I dreamt it” I said as I was staring straight into his eyes. 

“Look Alex, we know you did this, we just don’t know why, it looks like you’ve had a really good life and an amazing family, why would you k*ll them? You’re so young and had a bright future ahead of you and you k*lled your family” he said. 

I looked up at him again, “go f*ck yourself” I said to him. I looked back down again at the prison attire I had on. The officer got up and walked out of the room, 5 minutes later a couple of officers came in and put me in cuffs and brought me back to my cell.

A few weeks later I had my future trial, I walked into the courtroom and there were a bunch of people. There was police officers, my other family members, the media, there had to be at least 14 cameras in there. I sat down and my attorney sat down right next to me and he whispered in my ear. 

“Welcome to the show kid, look, we’re gonna make this as easy as possible and you’re gonna plead guilty and try to get you life in prison instead of the d*ath penalty.” 

I looked over at him “I didn’t do this, I’m innocent” he looked over at me again with a surprised look and chuckled, yes, he actually laughed in my face, a 15 year old kid. “If I had a nickel for every time I’ve heard that line, look I’m trying to help you hear. If you plead guilty then you will most likely get life instead of the d*ath penalty.”

The judge walked in and we all stood up, we were told to be seated. I sat down as I saw everyone staring at me. I started shaking as I knew the whole world was against me. I could feel every part of my body just losing its bl*od flow like my heart was about to stop.

The trial went on for 2 years, let’s just say that each time I walked into the courtroom, was another time I had to relive my family’s d*ath. Each one of my tears were seen as “he’s sorry he got caught, not that his family is dead”. I was F*CKING 15 years old, barely had any hair on my b*lls. I didn’t get to live my life and neither did my family. 

After 2 years of the trial going on, it was finally time for them to sentence me, I was sentenced to 4 consecutive life sentences. They dropped the chargers for the a**ault on the police officers. When the judge read off the sentence, I basically dropped to the ground. I screamed “I DIDN’T DO THIS” but not a single person listened to me. It took 26  years for them to finally listen to me, I took 15 lie detector test and every single one of them came back positive. I was and still am telling the truth. 

Luckily with how good science has gotten since the 90’s, they could finally look at the DNA left at the scene. I was in prison for 26 years for a crime that I didn’t commit. If it wasn’t for the dream I had 26 years earlier, I would be dead too. They found finger prints to a man named Brandon Torland, if you’ve noticed the similarities to the last names, he’s my uncle. We have a very small and close family except for my uncle Brandon. 27 years earlier, my uncle Brandon was cut off from the family and the trust fund that was gonna be left from my grandparents. 

My grandfather was a very wealthy man, he owned several different businesses he created and later sold. My uncle Brandon was the type of person to be the so called “life of the party” type. He eventually was addicted to h*roin and c*caine and would do anything to get his fix. He wanted to get the inheritance so the “party would never end” even if that meant that his nephew would go to prison for life. He also didn’t care that he was k*lling 4 of his family members including his nephew and niece and his brother and sister in law. 

You would think that it’s a good thing I was finally released and the man who actually killed my family was behind bars. Some people would call that making things right. It’s not about me being free and the scumbag that k*lled my family is behind bars. My life will forever be ruined even though my name has been cleared. I was eventually rewarded $17 million for being wrongfully convicted for a crime I didn’t commit. 

I will be donating the $17 million to several different charities including to people who were wrongfully accused. I wanted to quickly tell my story before it’s time for me to see my family again. I just want to say a huge thank you to Brian Luther who I met in prison for protecting me through the years and having my back. 

I will see you soon mom, dad, Eric, and Lucy.

Well, fellas. I’m about 3 weeks late with the annual update but I did it. I made it 12 months smoke free for the first time in over 30 years. Despite my best efforts I did gain too much weight but this year is focusing on better choices and healthier lifestyle. Not just to lose the weight (I’m not “dieting”) but focusing on less fast food and being more active.

I feel so much better overall and found that I get sick less often and have more energy overall. With the exception of carrying the extra weight, I am not getting winded as quickly and my doctor says my lung function increased about 5% from the same time last year. It’s not much but she said I’ll start seeing that increase rapidly over the next two years. 

Financially it has been tremendous. I realized pretty early on that it wasn’t just the cost of cigarettes (which was substantial. About $17 for two packs every day) but the other things I’d pick up since I was there. I’m making coffee at home now instead of the $2 at the store. I’m bringing lunch to work instead of grabbing the $7 sandwich and $2 soda. I’m not trickle spending $20-30 every morning before 8 am and that adds up so quickly. 

But the best part is being more present with the kids. I’m not cutting conversations short to run out and grab a butt. I’m able to focus because my brain isn’t hijacked by my nicotine addiction. I don’t see them wrinkle their nose because I smell like an ashtray. I got to show them that when we try, we can accomplish really hard things. I can live the example that I want them to emulate. They can see that even if we make bad decisions when we are young that we can change and be better. 

Thanks for the support here and being the community you all are. Here’s to the start of a new year and making better choices! ",460,1737556769.0,daddit,38,1.0,False

- Learning a few phrases such as ""Aloha"" (hello) and ""Mahalo"" (thank you).
- Exploring local art and handcrafts at markets or galleries.

Being respectful of cultural practices enhances your trip and deepens your understanding of the islands.

### Stay Hydrated and Safe

Hawaii’s warm weather can be inviting, but it’s important to stay hydrated. Always carry a water bottle during your adventures. Also:

I was always the one asking you. You always said yes, sure, let's go. Then I stopped asking.

Here we are.

Do you even miss me? Our routine? Do you miss when I would call you and ask if you wanted to hang out? Just talk? I'm pulling my hair out wondering what I did wrong. You know I don't do silence.

If you don't want to be friends anymore, that's fine. Tell me. Tell me you're mad at me and you never want to see me again. Please don't leave me out here like this, some dog bereft of a master. I'd wag my tail off waiting for you.",0,1737556595.0,UnsentLetters,1,0.5,False
1i7cgus,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1i7cgus/funnel_size/,Funnel Size,"Hello.

Been using a Bialetti pretty much my whole life. Inherited a 6 pot aluminum that has been in use in my family forever. Still use it regularly. I have no problems making a good a brew, but I never really thought much about it. It just works. (My parents called it ""Strong Coffee"", as in ""Honey can you make me some Strong Coffee?"".

Here is my issue.

My daughter thrifted this Brikka pot, but it came without a funnel. Been trying to figure this out. I measured and bought what I thought was the right size funnel, but as you see in the picture, it bent a bit and does not quite fit. My questions for the hive brain here:

* Can anyone tell me what size this is (2 cup, 3 cup, ??)? Seems like a simple question but I am not sure. There is a stamp on the bottom ""X07"", but other markings are scratched and not legible.
* You can see the funnel is just not fitting. Any advice on how to measure correctly or find the right size? Tried to use this one but it was a no go.

 

Thanks.

I've been using these resources to help people as they reach out or ask questions in various subs, so I hope this is welcome here and helpful.

Navigating a career as an analyst can feel overwhelming, especially with so many resources floating around. To help you focus, I’ve curated a guide covering certifications, casual learning arenas, portfolio-building tools, practice projects, career resources, and communities that can support your growth.

Note: I’m **not** affiliated with any of these links unless explicitly stated. I will do my best to keep these links updated if they expire or change, but please let me know if they do by sending me a message or adding a comment!

Let’s dive in!

# Certifications & Casual Learning

If you're looking to inject some credibility into your resume, options 1 & 2 below are for you.

If you'd like to learn new skills more casually, while still adding tons of value, check out options 3 & 4.

1. [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics): A beginner-friendly, paid program covering all of the basics such as data cleaning, visualization, and analysis tools like Tableau, SQL and R. This robust program should get you ready to tackle entry-level analyst roles upon completion.
2. [edX/Verizon Certification Programs](https://partnerships.edx.org/verizon/wfa/catalog): I really like this resource for two reasons: It's **100% FREE for 12 months** and the courses and professional certifications are offered by highly-reputable schools like Harvard, Rochester Institute of Technology, and more. These are free because of the Citizen Verizon initiative. Their goal is to prepare 500,000 individuals for future-proof jobs by 2030.
3. [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning): Offers quick, targeted courses, including [SQL Hands-On Practice](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fsql-hands-on-practice-solve-business-problems%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url%26shareId%3DSfnjyBVfR66uppGO%252F%252F0%252Fog%253D%253D) by [Jess Ramos, MSBA](https://www.linkedin.com/article/manage/drafts#), that are short enough to learn, but not bore you to tears. There's also a few Learning Paths that will give you most of the skills you need in a nice tidy package. [I really like this one](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/develop-your-data-analysis-skills), which I completed myself. Best part? It's included in LinkedIn Premium if you already have that, and it's quick and easy to share your certification on your profile after completion.
4. [Data Science Hub](https://www.datasciencehive.com/data-analyst-path): Created by Senior Research Analyst [Ryan Tennis](https://www.linkedin.com/article/manage/drafts#), this resource is also **100% FREE** (though I encourage you to follow the ""Buy Me a Coffee"" link if you enjoy the resource), this is the most casual learning environment, but I like it because it still has homework to keep you structured and check comprehension. You can also use the results of said homework to boost your portfolio (more on that below).

# Portfolio Building & Practice Projects

Building a clean, substantive portfolio can set you apart by showcasing your practical experience to potential employers. Portfolios are becoming more and more important in the hiring process as many analysts have set the standard to include them with their resume.

If you're not able to share real-world projects because of data privacy or confidentiality concerns, I recommend doing practice projects, then adding them to your portfolio. Guided practice projects can be a good gauge for how you are progressing your skills.

1. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/): Participate in competitions, learn various data science concepts, or explore free datasets to build personalized projects.
2. [Maven Analytics](https://mavenanalytics.io/): Maven has Guided Projects for practice, but also has a Showcase section where you can post your projects, allowing other users to ""Like"" and ""Comment"".
3. [DataSciencePortfol.io](https://www.datascienceportfol.io/): An absolutely must-have for any analyst, and this one is **100% FREE** (though the PRO option looks like a great value). This is a great, centralized location where you can keep all of your projects to show off to recruiters and the world!

# Career Resources

From job boards to interview prep, these tools will help you navigate the hiring process more effectively.

1. [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm): A classic! Research companies, salaries, and interview questions shared by employees and candidates.
2. [Interview Query](https://www.interviewquery.com/): An amazing resource specifically for data-related job interviews, offering prep guides, mock interviews, and datasets. Highly recommend this one!
3. [DataAnalyst.com Job Board](https://www.dataanalyst.com/): I found this through a Reddit user that hand curates this list. It's a great place to look for analytics roles.
4. [Fishbowl](https://www.fishbowlapp.com/): An anonymous place to ask questions about companies and get advice. Learn about the company's culture (toxic?) or find out if your offer was too low before accepting the offer.

# Communities

Joining a community is one of the best ways you can learn what to (and what not to) do in your career, during an interview, or while working on a project. There is so much to learn from discussing things with others - so go join a community today!

1. [GOATs - Global Organization for Analysts' Transformation](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14585275/): Shameless plug - this is my LinkedIn Group, designed to be a fun and supportive place for analysts at all stages of their career journey. The group is designed to be professional but fun (data-related memes allowed!) - and don't be shy, please introduce yourself once joining!
2. [List of Data & Analytics Online Communities](https://data-storyteller.medium.com/list-of-data-analytics-online-communities-70831894aef7): [Maggie Wolff](https://www.linkedin.com/article/manage/drafts#), aka the DataStoryTeller, is a fantastic writer and advocate for analysts. She has her own [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/npC3pbSrd4) aimed at early career stage analysts but this list contains a lot of communities to choose from, including a crowd-sourced list at the bottom of the article with additional groups.
3. **Reddit:** These are great places to post questions, help others, and get feedback on projects or career topics.

* [r/dataanalyst](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalyst/): \~25K Members, good balance of analytics discussion and career topics
* [r/datascience](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/): \~2.5M Members, the largest sub on this list, less focused on the analyst audience and more for data scientists, but there is a lot of great technical discussion in this sub
* [r/businessanalysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/businessanalysis/): \~80K Members, largely career and industry discussion but a great place for current and future business analysts
* [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/): \~21M Members, a place to see good data visualizations
* [r/dataisugly](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisugly/): \~148K Members, often worth a good laugh, a place to see some more poorly-prepared visuals
* [r/dataanalysiscareers](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysiscareers/): \~4K Members, a much smaller sub, but very career-focused
* [r/analytics](https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/): \~196K Members, designed for discussing analytics practices, methods, and learning skills

# Conclusion

Your career as an analyst is a marathon, not a sprint. Invest time in learning, building your portfolio, leveraging career resources, and engaging with communities to accelerate your growth.

1i7cdbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1i7cdbj/support_advice_encouragement_needed/,"Support, Advice, Encouragement Needed","Hey everyone, first time poster here. I, 38 F, have been working out consistently since September 2024, usually 5 days a week. This was a huge change for me; prior, I’d never made a commitment to working out longer than a month and exercised sporadically at that. Although I realize I have a lifelong commitment ahead of me, I’m feeling really down about my progress so far and I’m looking for sparks of encouragement and advice. 

Goal: to lose weight (currently 181lb, my highest non-pregnancy weight), have more energy, reduce health risks, and overall feel stronger and more capable. 

My hurdles: 
1) this is my first time prioritizing working out. It’s not a habit for me and I don’t enjoy it (some do, lol)
2) I work second shift 3-11PM in a high stress job that rarely permits a reasonable dinner and results in poor sleep
3) I need to improve my water intake
4) I was hospitalized after the birth of my child where I lost ~50lbs in a matter of weeks due to sepsis. I truly feel like this “crash” impacted the way I lose/hold on to weight. 

My strengths:
1) I’m not sedentary. 99% of my day is on my feet. My job is an active one, I rarely sit down. 
2) I love to cook, love vegetables
3) supportive spouse 
4) flexible time during the day before work 
5) I do roller derby 1x a week (high intensity) 

I need encouragement. The scale hasn’t budged in months, not a pound. The 5x a week exercise is the best I can do at this time, I have no time/energy to do more than I do now (45 minutes usually stair master and bike). HR averages 120-150 during workouts. I eat 2-3 meals per day, usually some meat + veg. I don’t drink soda. I don’t drink alcohol. I do drink coffee but I’m cutting back (on calories and frequency). I’d like to try to add in things like calorie counting, macro tracking, water tracking, etc, but I honestly have so little energy for the things I do now…

Is anyone in the same boat— ideally late 30s female, has had children, went from sedentary to consistent workouts— has anything started to work for you, that you’d recommend moving to the front of the line?

There's this girl in his life (24F)—they were friends for 8 years, but then they started sleeping together for a couple of months right before him and I started dating.

At one point in our relationship, they decided to hang out (he told me they were going for coffee)—instead, they went for a walk and hung out in a park alone. I even had a friend message me to let me know she saw them sitting on a bench alone and she found it weird. I made it clear to him that it made me very uncomfortable, seeing that she was the last one he was sleeping with before him and I got together. He didn't see anything wrong with it and disregarded my feelings completely until his sisters told him that it was in fact weird and 'off'. He then decided to stop talking to her (not because he wanted to).

Recently they started talking again and she invited him to go for a walk again. He says that ""they were friends for 8 years before they hooked up"" and he ""misses the friendship."" I find it weird that they feel the need to hang out alone.

1i7catr,https://i.redd.it/u8aas2ea2kee1.png,Body Doubling: A Simple Yet Powerful Strategy to Boost Focus and Productivity,"**TL;DR:** Body doubling, the act of working alongside someone else, can significantly improve focus, accountability, and productivity. Whether in-person or virtual, this strategy leverages social accountability and connection to help you tackle tasks and sustain momentum. It’s especially beneficial for individuals with ADHD or those who struggle with procrastination.  

---

Have you ever noticed that you’re more productive when someone else is in the room with you, even if they’re not directly involved in your work? That’s the essence of **body doubling**, a strategy gaining traction for its ability to enhance focus and reduce procrastination.  

### What Is Body Doubling?  
Body doubling is the practice of working alongside another person—either physically or virtually—to increase focus and accountability. This person doesn’t necessarily help with the task itself; their mere presence creates a subtle yet powerful sense of motivation to stay on track.  

It’s particularly effective for individuals with ADHD or anyone who finds it difficult to start or finish tasks, but the benefits extend to anyone looking to boost productivity.  

---

### The Science Behind Body Doubling  
Here’s why body doubling works so well:  

- **Accountability:** Knowing someone is there with you, even virtually, creates a sense of responsibility. You’re less likely to procrastinate or get distracted when someone else is present.  
- **Social Motivation:** Humans are social beings. The presence of another person activates a natural desire to “mirror” their focus and effort.  
- **Reduced Isolation:** Working with someone else alleviates feelings of isolation, which can often lead to demotivation.  
- **Increased Dopamine:** For neurodiverse individuals, the social aspect of body doubling can boost dopamine levels, aiding focus and motivation.  

---

### Practical Ways to Use Body Doubling  
You don’t need to be in the same room with someone to reap the benefits of body doubling. Here are some ideas to incorporate it into your routine:  

- **In-Person:**  
  - Work in a shared office or co-working space.  
  - Invite a friend or colleague to a “silent focus” session.  
  - Pair up with a family member or roommate for household tasks.  

- **Virtual Options:**  
  - Join online co-working sessions. There are plenty of free or low-cost platforms where people gather to work in silence or with minimal interaction.  
  - Use video chat to connect with a friend or peer while working on your respective tasks.  
  - Explore “study with me” livestreams, where creators set a timer and work alongside you.  

- **Structure Your Sessions:**  
  - Set clear goals at the beginning. What do you want to accomplish?  
  - Use techniques like the Pomodoro method to create focused work intervals.  
  - Check in periodically to share progress or recalibrate your goals.  

---

### Why It Works for Neurodiverse Individuals  
For individuals with ADHD or other neurodivergent traits, body doubling provides:  

- **External Structure:** A shared environment reduces the mental load of staying focused alone.  
- **Reduced Boredom:** Having someone nearby can make even mundane tasks feel less daunting.  
- **Support Through Difficult Tasks:** Emotional encouragement can help overcome the inertia of starting or finishing challenging tasks.  

While body doubling isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution, it’s a simple and flexible strategy that can make a big difference.  

---

### A Personal Take  
In my own experience as a leadership coach, I’ve seen how body doubling transforms productivity. One client, a remote team leader, started virtual co-working sessions with their team twice a week. Not only did they report higher focus and output, but the sessions also fostered a stronger sense of connection within the team.  

For me personally, working alongside someone—whether at a coffee shop or on a quiet Zoom call—keeps me grounded and helps me tackle tasks that might otherwise sit on my to-do list for far too long.  

---

### Does Body Doubling Work for Everyone?  
Not always. Some individuals might find the presence of others distracting or feel self-conscious. Like any strategy, it’s worth experimenting to see if it’s right for you.  

**Tips for Success:**  
- Choose the right partner: Someone focused and aligned with your goals.  
- Communicate expectations: Agree on the level of interaction beforehand.  
- Be flexible: Try different formats (in-person vs. virtual) to find what works.  

---

What do you think? Have you tried body doubling before, or is this a new concept for you? I’d love to hear your experiences, whether you’re a seasoned pro at it or just getting started. Let’s discuss how this simple strategy could change the way you work!""",1,1737556071.0,agileideation,0,1.0,False

To help you focus, I’ve curated a guide covering certifications, casual learning arenas, portfolio-building tools, practice projects, career resources, and communities that can support your growth.

Note: I’m **not** affiliated with any of these links unless explicitly stated. I will do my best to keep these links updated if they expire or change, but please let me know if they do by sending me a message or adding a comment!

Let’s dive in!

# Certifications & Casual Learning

If you're looking to inject some credibility into your resume, options 1 & 2 below are for you.

If you'd like to learn new skills more casually, while still adding tons of value, check out options 3 & 4.

1. [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics): A beginner-friendly, paid program covering all of the basics such as data cleaning, visualization, and analysis tools like Tableau, SQL and R. This robust program should get you ready to tackle entry-level analyst roles upon completion.
2. [edX/Verizon Certification Programs](https://partnerships.edx.org/verizon/wfa/catalog): I really like this resource for two reasons: It's **100% FREE for 12 months** and the courses and professional certifications are offered by highly-reputable schools like Harvard, Rochester Institute of Technology, and more. These are free because of the Citizen Verizon initiative. Their goal is to prepare 500,000 individuals for future-proof jobs by 2030.
3. [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning): Offers quick, targeted courses, including [SQL Hands-On Practice](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fsql-hands-on-practice-solve-business-problems%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url%26shareId%3DSfnjyBVfR66uppGO%252F%252F0%252Fog%253D%253D) by [Jess Ramos, MSBA](https://www.linkedin.com/article/manage/drafts#), that are short enough to learn, but not bore you to tears. There's also a few Learning Paths that will give you most of the skills you need in a nice tidy package. [I really like this one](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/develop-your-data-analysis-skills), which I completed myself. Best part? It's included in LinkedIn Premium if you already have that, and it's quick and easy to share your certification on your profile after completion.
4. [Data Science Hub](https://www.datasciencehive.com/data-analyst-path): Created by Senior Research Analyst [Ryan Tennis](https://www.linkedin.com/article/manage/drafts#), this resource is also **100% FREE** (though I encourage you to follow the ""Buy Me a Coffee"" link if you enjoy the resource), this is the most casual learning environment, but I like it because it still has homework to keep you structured and check comprehension. You can also use the results of said homework to boost your portfolio (more on that below).

# Portfolio Building & Practice Projects

Building a clean, substantive portfolio can set you apart by showcasing your practical experience to potential employers. Portfolios are becoming more and more important in the hiring process as many analysts have set the standard to include them with their resume.

If you're not able to share real-world projects because of data privacy or confidentiality concerns, I recommend doing practice projects, then adding them to your portfolio. Guided practice projects can be a good gauge for how you are progressing your skills.

1. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/): Participate in competitions, learn various data science concepts, or explore free datasets to build personalized projects.
2. [Maven Analytics](https://mavenanalytics.io/): Maven has Guided Projects for practice, but also has a Showcase section where you can post your projects, allowing other users to ""Like"" and ""Comment"".
3. [DataSciencePortfol.io](https://www.datascienceportfol.io/): An absolutely must-have for any analyst, and this one is **100% FREE** (though the PRO option looks like a great value). This is a great, centralized location where you can keep all of your projects to show off to recruiters and the world!

# Career Resources

From job boards to interview prep, these tools will help you navigate the hiring process more effectively.

1. [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm): A classic! Research companies, salaries, and interview questions shared by employees and candidates.
2. [Interview Query](https://www.interviewquery.com/): An amazing resource specifically for data-related job interviews, offering prep guides, mock interviews, and datasets. Highly recommend this one!
3. [DataAnalyst.com Job Board](https://www.dataanalyst.com/): I found this through a Reddit user that hand curates this list. It's a great place to look for analytics roles.
4. [Fishbowl](https://www.fishbowlapp.com/): An anonymous place to ask questions about companies and get advice. Learn about the company's culture (toxic?) or find out if your offer was too low before accepting the offer.

# Communities

Joining a community is one of the best ways you can learn what to (and what not to) do in your career, during an interview, or while working on a project. There is so much to learn from discussing things with others - so go join a community today!

1. [GOATs - Global Organization for Analysts' Transformation](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14585275/): Shameless plug - this is my LinkedIn Group, designed to be a fun and supportive place for analysts at all stages of their career journey. The group is designed to be professional but fun (data-related memes allowed!) - and don't be shy, please introduce yourself once joining!
2. [List of Data & Analytics Online Communities](https://data-storyteller.medium.com/list-of-data-analytics-online-communities-70831894aef7): [Maggie Wolff](https://www.linkedin.com/article/manage/drafts#), aka the DataStoryTeller, is a fantastic writer and advocate for analysts. She has her own [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/npC3pbSrd4) aimed at early career stage analysts but this list contains a lot of communities to choose from, including a crowd-sourced list at the bottom of the article with additional groups.
3. **Reddit:** These are great places to post questions, help others, and get feedback on projects or career topics. Reddit is typically a little more ""wild west"" and not everyone's flavor, but generally these subs are more professional and well-moderated:

* [r/dataanalyst](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalyst/): \~25K Members, good balance of analytics discussion and career topics
* [r/datascience](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/): \~2.5M Members, the largest sub on this list, less focused on the analyst audience and more for data scientists, but there is a lot of great technical discussion in this sub
* [r/businessanalysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/businessanalysis/): \~80K Members, largely career and industry discussion but a great place for current and future business analysts
* [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/): \~21M Members, a place to see good data visualizations
* [r/dataisugly](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisugly/): \~148K Members, often worth a good laugh, a place to see some more poorly-prepared visuals
* [r/dataanalysiscareers](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysiscareers/): \~4K Members, a much smaller sub, but very career-focused
* [r/analytics](https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/): \~196K Members, designed for discussing analytics practices, methods, and learning skills

# Conclusion

Your career as an analyst is a marathon, not a sprint. Invest time in learning, building your portfolio, leveraging career resources, and engaging with communities to accelerate your growth.

There's this girl in his life (24F)—they were friends for 8 years, but then they started sleeping together for a couple of months right before him and I started dating.

At one point in our relationship, they decided to hang out (he told me they were going for coffee)—instead, they went for a walk and hung out in a park alone. I even had a friend message me to let me know she saw them sitting on a bench alone and she found it weird. I made it clear to him that it made me very uncomfortable, seeing that she was the last one he was sleeping with before him and I got together. He didn't see anything wrong with it and disregarded my feelings completely until his sisters told him that it was in fact weird and 'off'. He then decided to stop talking to her (not because he wanted to).

Recently they started talking again and she invited him to go for a walk again. He says that ""they were friends for 8 years before they hooked up"" and he ""misses the friendship."" I find it weird that they feel the need to hang out alone.

So this makes things doubly hard for me.

Last week she reached out to hand some stuff over ""I've only got 30 mins for a quick coffee"" and this was the first time in 10 weeks I had seen or heard from her. We sat there and chatted for over three hours - it was almost as easy and as comfortable as it's ever been. We've known each other decades.

Since then she has pulled right back and declined my offer the next day to meet up again. Emails became terse again, and I've just stopped mailing for a few days.

I'm 100% anxious, and she's DA. 

Apologies if this doesn't fit into this group. Any thoughts on why she made out to be reluctantly meeting, timeboxed it at 30 mins but then spent over 3 hours - but then has subsequently pulled away. Was it me messaging the next day about meeting again?

Given that we need to be in fairly regular contact ref finances / house stuff, is it unrealistic to consider this No Contact?

I’m looking for recommendations to expand my fragrance collection, and I’d love to hear your suggestions. I’m after **fragrances** with **loud projection**, **great longevity**, and, of course an amazing scent, the **best fragrances you can think of**!

I’ll share a list of the fragrances I already own, along with the ones currently on my wish list, to give you a better idea of my preferences. I’m a big fan of **gourmand and oriental fragrances**, but I’m open to exploring other styles if you think they’re worth it.

Feel free to ask me any questions, and I’ll do my best to respond. To make things easier, I’ll also share my ratings and reviews of the fragrances I have.

**Fragrance Reviews:**



**#1: French Avenue Liquid Brun**

**Rating:** 9/10

**Clone of:** Parfums de Marly Althair

Wow, what a stunning fragrance this is! Liquid Brun is the most expensive clone in my collection, but it’s worth every penny. The warm, spicy vanilla and cinnamon notes are absolutely addictive—I can’t stop smelling it! It’s incredibly close to the original, at about 95% accuracy.

• **Projection:** Solid for 4 hours, then becomes a skin scent.

• **Longevity:** 8–10 hours.



**#2: Club de Nuit Intense Man Limited Edition (CDNMI LE)**

**Rating:** 9.5/10

**Clone of:** Creed Aventus

This one was quite the rollercoaster! I was so hyped for this fragrance, but my first experience was a complete disaster. When I initially sprayed it, it was one of the harshest things I’d ever smelled—like someone squeezing lemon juice straight into my nose. It was sharp, overwhelming, and I couldn’t detect anything else.

I decided to stay patient and let it macerate, and wow—it completely blew my mind. The harshness was gone, leaving behind a beautifully balanced, stellar fragrance.

• **Projection:** Loud for 4–6 hours, then softer but still noticeable.

• **Longevity:** 10+ hours.



**#3: Afnan 9 PM**

**Rating:** 9/10

**Clone of:** Jean Paul Gaultier Ultra Male

This fragrance holds a special place in my heart because the original JPG Ultra Male was my signature scent for a few years. Afnan 9 PM is about 92% similar to the original, with amazing performance and projection.

• **Projection:** Strong for 6+ hours.

• **Longevity:** 12+ hours.



**#4: Lattafa Vintage Radio**

**Rating:** 8.5/10

**Clone of:** Initio Paragon

A beautifully crafted fragrance with a unique balance of sweetness and elegance. The **plum and lavender** combination feels sophisticated yet approachable.

• **Projection:** Solid for 4 hours.

• **Longevity:** 8–10 hours.



**#5: Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa**

**Rating:** 8.5/10

**Twist of:** Lattafa Khamrah (Clone of SAVA Gissah)

The **boozy sweetness and coffee** create a luxurious vibe. It smells like a fragrance that could easily cost €100 or more.

• **Projection:** Strong for 5–6 hours.

• **Longevity:** 10–12 hours.



**#6: Lattafa Jasoor**

**Rating:** 8.2/10

**Clone of:** Valentino Uomo Born in Roma Coral Fantasy

A mass-appealing fragrance that’s easy to wear. Smells about **95% accurate** to the original but lacks a bit of the tobacco richness.

• **Projection:** Moderate for 3–4 hours.

• **Longevity:** 8+ hours.



**#7: Azzure Oud**

**Rating:** 8.5/10

**Clone of:** Maison Crivelli Oud Maracuja

A bold, niche-quality fragrance. The **oud and fruity notes** create a luxurious and addictive combination.

• **Projection:** Loud for 6 hours.

• **Longevity:** 10 hours.



**#8: Lattafa Atlas**

**Rating:** 8/10

**Clone of:** Orto Parisi Megamare

An aquatic scent that captures the **fresh, sea vibes**. Perfect for summer with its **6 hours of loud projection** and all-day longevity.

• **Projection:** Loud for 6 hours, softer for another 4.

• **Longevity:** All day (10+ hours).



**#9: Mexican Bronco by Volare**

**Rating:** 7.5/10

**Clone of:** Xerjoff Naxos

An addictive **honey and tobacco** scent, perfect for summer evenings. However, **projection lasts 1–2 hours**, and **longevity is about 6 hours**. Hoping maceration will improve performance.

• **Projection:** Moderate for 1–2 hours.

• **Longevity:** 6 hours.



**#10: Maison Alhambra Winston (Formally The Tux)**

**Rating:** 7.5/10

**Clone of:** YSL Tuxedo

An elegant and refined scent, but the **projection and longevity** are moderate at best.

• **Projection:** Moderate for 3–4 hours.

• **Longevity:** 6–7 hours.



**#11: Lattafa Caprice**

**Rating:** 7/10

**Clone of:** YSL La Nuit de L’Homme Blue Électrique

A **safe and non-offensive scent**, but a bit **boring** for my taste.

• **Projection:** Moderate for 2 hours.

• **Longevity:** 6 hours.



**Wish List: Clones I’m Interested In**



• **Liam Grey** — Clone of **BDK Gris Charnel**

• **Tom Ford Noir Extreme**

• **Al Haramain Amber Oud Gold Extrait Pure Parfum** — Clone of **Xerjoff Erba Pura**

• **Aether** — Clone of **Parfums de Marly Greenley**

• **Fragrance World The Shadow** — Clone of **Nishane Ani**

• **Al Haramain Aqua Dubai** — Clone of **Louis Vuitton Imagination**

• **Orientica Xclusif Oud Blue / Al Haramain Amber Oud Exclusif Bleu (US Version)** — Clone of **Parfums de Marly Layton**

• **Fragrance World Royal Blend** — Clone of **Kilian’s Angel’s Share**

• Lattafa The Kingdom — Clone of Jean Paul Gualtier Le Male Elixer
